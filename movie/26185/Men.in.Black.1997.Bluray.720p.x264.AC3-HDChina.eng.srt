1
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:04,327


2
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,105
Goddamn bugs.

3
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:22,814
Oh, shit!

4
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,178
Oh, crap.

5
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:35,260


6
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:44,002
Well, Nick the Dick. What a surprise.

7
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:45,421
Where you coming from, Nick?

8
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,088
Fishing in Cuernavaca.

9
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,641
Sure you are. Let's take a look at your catch.

10
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,089
Come on.

11
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:02,460
Me? I would've thrown them back.

12
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,810
What do you get? . 00 bucks a head? 200?

13
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,613
Hope you saved it all for your lawyer. You are gonna need it.

14
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,407
We'll take it from here.

15
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:23,150
Who the hell are you?

16
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,770
I.N.S., Division 6.

17
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:27,309
Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

18
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:28,518
Really?

19
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:30,657
Who you got your money on, Dee?

20
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,807
Tough call, Kay.

21
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:36,351


22
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:38,011


23
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,811


24
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,431


25
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:46,252


26
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,267


27
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:50,192


28
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:51,892


29
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:53,862


30
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,964


31
00:04:56,844 --> 00:04:59,477


32
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:04,142


33
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:08,065


34
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,643
- We've got a winner here.

35
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,320
- Oh, I know.

36
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:15,018


37
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:16,683


38
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,084


39
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,266
Sir--

40
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,963
Don't ''sir'' me, young man.

41
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:25,092
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

42
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,695


43
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:33,512
We're going to chat with our friend. You can hit the road.

44
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:38,690
Keep on protecting us from the dangerous aliens.

45
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,943
You ever hear of Division 6?

46
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,040
There is no Division 6.

47
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:48,229
- This is bullshit.

48
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:49,535
- Hell, yeah.

49
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:54,188
Looks like you fell off the bus in the wrong part of town, amigo.

50
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:57,391
I'll bet dollars to pesos you're not from anywhere near here.

51
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,558
Mikey?

52
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,246
When did they let you out of jail?

53
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:15,364
Political refugee. Right.

54
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:17,814
You know how many treaties you just violated?

55
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:20,300
- One! - Try seven.

56
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:24,924
That's enough, Mikey. You hand me that head.

57
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:32,157
Put up your arms and all your flippers.

58
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:45,055
Shit.

59
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:50,880
Shoot him!

60
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:22,526
That.

61
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:29,234
Was not human. I know. You got some entrails on you, pal.

62
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:31,506
What the hell?

63
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,254
The situation's under control. Calm down, please.

64
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:38,044
Give me your attention for a moment. I'll tell you what happened.

65
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:49,081
This is called a neuralizer.

66
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,330
It's a gift from some friends from out of town.

67
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:53,397
This red eye isolates...

68
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:56,712
the electronic impulses in your brains, specifically memory.

69
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,480
Fellas, give me a splay

70
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:00,724
burn around the perimeter with holes...

71
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:04,330
at 40, 60 and 80 meters from right here. Thank you.

72
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:10,770
Good. Thank you.

73
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:12,788
- What in the hell is going on?

74
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:14,562
- Excellent question.

75
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,413
The answer you're looking for lies right here.

76
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:22,326
Who are you, really?

77
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,316
Really?

78
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:27,611
I am just a figment of your imagination.

79
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:33,973
Damn, what a gullible breed.

80
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:38,775
I'm serious, fellas. You're lucky to be alive after a blast like that.

81
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,734
- What blast?

82
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,524
- The underground gas vein, genius.

83
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,995
You should exercise a lot more caution before firing.

84
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,670
I'll tell you that right now. Especially you.

85
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:51,134
Have yourselves checked out with E.M.S. before you leave.

86
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:05,555
I'm sorry about back there.

87
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:07,046
That happens.

88
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:08,747
Didn't used to.

89
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:13,196
The spirit's willing, Kay, but...

90
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:15,992
the rest of me--

91
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,804
They're beautiful, aren't they?

92
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:21,876
What?

93
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:23,501
The stars.

94
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:26,692
We never just look anymore.

95
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:28,587
No.

96
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:33,951
I'll tell you, Kay...

97
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:36,724
I will miss the chase.

98
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:36,961
I will miss the chase.

99
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:43,129
No, Dee...

100
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:45,507
you won't.

101
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,859
Freeze!

102
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,152
N.Y.P.D., freeze!

103
00:09:52,574 --> 00:09:53,997
All yours, Edwards.

104
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,570
Freeze means stop!

105
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,645
What the hell?

106
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:17,043
It just be raining black people in New York.

107
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,819
Do you see this?

108
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,939
N.Y.P.D.!

109
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:48,866
It means I will knock your punk-ass down!

110
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,387
He's coming!

111
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:53,485
Yeah, and when he gets here, I'll arrest his ass too.

112
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:59,635
You trying to catch a beat down?

113
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,150
What's up?

114
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:11,165
He's coming.

115
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:14,367
He's coming because I failed. Now he'll kill me.

116
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:16,844
You pissing everybody off today, huh?

117
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:20,284
You don't understand.

118
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:22,707
Your world's going to end.

119
00:12:25,726 --> 00:12:26,971
What the hell are you?

120
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:34,977
Watch that ledge. Watch it.

121
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,909
Come down. We'll get those eyes fixed. Don't even worry about it.

122
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:41,226
Wait a minute. Let me talk to you!

123
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:50,963
I go out. I work my butt off to make a liing.

124
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:55,255
All I want is to come home to a nice clean house... with a nice fat steak on the table...

125
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:56,890
but instead I get this. Looks like poison.

126
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,127
but instead I get this. Looks like poison.

127
00:12:57,324 --> 00:13:01,630
Don't you take that away! I'm eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't it?

128
00:13:01,662 --> 00:13:04,402
I swear to God, I wouldn't be surprised if it was...

129
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:08,282
the way you skulk around like a dog been hit too much.Or ain't been hit enough!

130
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:09,687
I can't make up my mind.

131
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:11,711
You're useless, Beatrice.

132
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,837
The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!

133
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,513
Figures.

134
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,123
What the heck is it, Edgar?

135
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,552
Get your big butt back in the house.

136
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,760
Place projectile weapon on the ground.

137
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:59,585
You can have my gun...

138
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,937
when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers.

139
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,416
Your proposal is acceptable.

140
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,574
Edgar, what on earth was that?

141
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:49,911
Sugar.

142
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:52,636
I've never seen sugar do that.

143
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,790
Give me sugar.

144
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:01,966
In water.

145
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:09,598
More.

146
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:14,336
More.

147
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:31,027
Your skin is hanging off your bones.

148
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:43,759
Is that better?

149
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:15,929
''The perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids.''

150
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,825
You mean blinked with both eyes?

151
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,219
No, sir. He blinked one set, then a completely different set.

152
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:23,892
You know, like high beams and low beams.

153
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:26,661
Was that before...

154
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,397
or after he drew the weapon that you

155
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,235
claim evaporated into a million pieces?

156
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,103
After, sir.

157
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:37,834
Why is it that no other officers saw either of these events?

158
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:40,795
Some other officers are soggy around the midsection.

159
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:43,063
I guess that's why they couldn't keep up.

160
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:44,640
If you were half the man I am--

161
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:47,458
What the hell? I am half the man that you are.

162
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,251
- What is your problem?

163
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:50,668
- You being all up in my damn face.

164
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:53,077
- I think he threw him off the roof. - Maybe you're next.

165
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:54,561
- I want to talk to you. Now.

166
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:56,977
- Ten minutes, take your best shot.

167
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:01,874
Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard.

168
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:10,152
I believe you. Laurel Weaver, Deputy Medical Examiner.

169
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,260
Find me at the morgue on 26th. I'll show you.

170
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,244
Wait.

171
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:14,545
Wait a minute!

172
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:19,999
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's office working on theJohn Doe?

173
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,452
- Yes, that's right. - Will you look at this, please?

174
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:31,250
Some night, huh?

175
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:32,430
Yeah, some night.

176
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,616
They were gills, not eyelids.

177
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,012
Gills. He was out of breath.

178
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:39,946
Who are you?

179
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,910
Did he say anything to you?

180
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,094
Yeah, the world was coming to an end.

181
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:46,500
Did he say when?

182
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:55,470
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?

183
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:56,943
Absolutely.

184
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:00,290
Come on. Let's take a ride.

185
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,378
Wait a minute. Look, I got tons of paperwork--

186
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:04,472
- Right. It's all done.

187
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:05,639
- Good work, Edwards.

188
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,824
You really ran this dude down on foot? That's tough, kid.

189
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:10,456
That's double tough.

190
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,747
So who exactly are you with?

191
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:22,823
So who exactly are you with?

192
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,346
F.B.I.? N.S.A.?

193
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:30,057
I'm part of a bureau that licenses, monitors and polices... alien actiity on the planet Earth.

194
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:31,480
Whateer.

195
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,119
We're here.

196
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,527
- This is where we're going? - Yeah.

197
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:38,756
This is JackJeebs' spot.

198
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,532
He buys from chain snatchers.

199
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:42,500
- He doesn't even sell guns. - Really?

200
00:18:43,136 --> 00:18:44,145
All right, look.

201
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:46,451
I'll slide in and put my thing down.

202
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,518
But when I come out I want answers.

203
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:50,374
Go put your thing down.

204
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,946
Officer Eduardo.

205
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:01,074
How did these get here? I thought I turned them in to the authorities.

206
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:04,701
The way I hear it you're into something hotter than stolen Rolexes.

207
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:07,605
I'm a huge crack dealer now, but I work here as I love the hours.

208
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,911
I'm talking about guns, smart ass.

209
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:14,347
- Weird ones. - Come on. What you see is what I got.

210
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,224
Why don't you show him the imports,Jeebs?

211
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:21,040
- Hiya, Kay. How are you?

212
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:22,527
- Show him the imports right now.

213
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:24,550
I got out of that business a long time ago.

214
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:26,066
- Why do you lie to me? I hate it.

215
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:27,727
-Just hold on a second.

216
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:29,182
- I'm gonna count to three. - He'll do it,Jeebs.

217
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:33,418
- One... - That man does not look stable.

218
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,398
- He's crazy when he's like this. - He's always crazy.

219
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,503
Why don't you get a massage?

220
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:38,525
Take a cruise.

221
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:41,724
- Drop the weapon. Hands on your head! - I warned him.

222
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:44,222
- Drop it! Don't make me kill you. - You warned him.

223
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:47,240
You insensitive prick!

224
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:53,767
Do you have any idea how much that stings?

225
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,572
Show us the merchandise or you'll lose another head,Jeebs.

226
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:10,190
Mr. Edwards?

227
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:17,714
Right there. The one in the middle.

228
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:24,518
You sold a reverberating carbonizer with mutate capacity...

229
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:27,074
to an unlicensed cephlapoid! Jeebs, you piece of--

230
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:28,931
He looked all right to me.

231
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,019
- Assassination. Who's the target?

232
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:32,010
- I don't know.

233
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:34,227
- Goddamn it,Jeebs! - I don't know!

234
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,041
All that's confiscated.

235
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:41,414
I want you on the next transport off this rock... or I'll shoot you where it don't grow back.

236
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:48,548
And I'm going to be back to talk about them Rolexes.

237
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,304
Searching for a handle on the moment?

238
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:16,442
I can't help you.

239
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,086
The only comfort I can offer...

240
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:22,701
is my promise that tomorrow morning you won't remember a thing.

241
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:25,869
That's not exactly some shit you just forget.

242
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,460
Ever seen one of these?

243
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:33,544
She looks over to her husband...

244
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,902
then sets it back down in her lap and says...

245
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:40,275
'' Honey, this one's eating my popcorn.''

246
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:44,587
Get it?

247
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,139
- Yeah. - '' Eating my popcorn.''

248
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:50,709
Gotta go. Thanks for the egg rolls, kid.

249
00:21:50,824 --> 00:21:52,212
Wait a minute.

250
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:53,326
Who are you?

251
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:56,234
See what I mean about tequila? You're a bright young man,James.

252
00:21:56,329 --> 00:21:58,238
But you need to lay off the sauce.

253
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:00,726
I'll see you bright and early, 9:00.

254
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:01,700
Be there...

255
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:04,056
or be square.

256
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:11,787
MIB

257
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:14,221


258
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:20,921


259
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:26,848
Well, well, well.

260
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:30,219
Moving right in, are we? Think we own the place?

261
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,713
I got an eviction notice for you boys.

262
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:35,678
Just what exactly do you think you're doing here?

263
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:37,880
Taking care of your pest problem.

264
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:39,427
Pest problem?

265
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:41,483
Pest?

266
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,869
Yeah, you got a hell of an infestation.

267
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,892
You know, I've noticed an infestation here.

268
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:52,686
Everywhere I look in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum...

269
00:22:52,686 --> 00:22:55,462
totally convinced of their own superiority...

270
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:57,840
as they scurry about their short...

271
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,761
pointless lives.

272
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,641
Don't you want to get rid of them?

273
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:06,530
In the worst way.

274
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:29,556


275
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:30,280


276
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:43,793
Help you?

277
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,122
This dude gave me this card--

278
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,627
Elevator.

279
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,626
You're late. Sit down.

280
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,095
My name is Zed.

281
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:26,284
You're all here because you're the best of the best.

282
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:31,065
Marines, Air Force, Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, N.Y.P.D.

283
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:32,462
And we're looking for one of you.

284
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:34,126
Just one.

285
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:37,205
What will follow is a series of simple tests...

286
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:41,217
for motor skills, concentration, stamina.

287
00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:43,158
I see we have a question.

288
00:24:43,297 --> 00:24:47,045
I'm sorry, maybe you already answered this but...

289
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,661
why exactly are we here?

290
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:49,810
Son.

291
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:53,565
Second LieutenantJakeJensen. West Point. Graduate with honors.

292
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,558
We're here because you want the best of the best of the best, sir!

293
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:04,558
What's so funny, Edwards?

294
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:07,065
Your boy, Captain America, here.

295
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:10,257
''The best of the best of the best, sir!''

296
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,391
''With honors.''

297
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:14,031
He's just really excited,

298
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,212
and he has no clue why we're here.

299
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,866
That's very funny to me.

300
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,898
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

301
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:31,693
Okay, let's get going.

302
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:57,503
Want to get down on this?

303
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,192
Edwards, what the hell happened?

304
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,025
Hesitated.

305
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:33,684
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?

306
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:36,306
She was the only one that actually seemed dangerous at the time, sir.

307
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:37,790
How'd you decide that?

308
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,815
First, I was going to pop this guy hanging from the streetlight...

309
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:42,604
but I realized he's just working out.

310
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:46,808
How'd I feel if somebody bust me in my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

311
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:48,719
Then I saw this snarling beast guy...

312
00:27:48,848 --> 00:27:52,038
and I noticed he had a tissue in his hand and realized...

313
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,275
he's not snarling, he's sneezing.

314
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,879
Ain't no real threat there.

315
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:57,196
Then I saw Tiffany.

316
00:27:57,357 --> 00:28:00,453
I'm thinking, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto...

317
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:03,515
bunch of monsters at night with quantum physics books.

318
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,433
She about to start some shit, Zed.

319
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:08,334
She's about eight. Those books are way too advanced for her.

320
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:10,936
If you ask me, she's up to something.

321
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:13,986
Honestly, I'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it.

322
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:20,096
Or do I owe her an apology?

323
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,108
That was a good shot though, right?

324
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:36,679
He's got a real problem with authority.

325
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:38,112
So do I.

326
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,838
But this kid ran down a cephlapoid on foot, boss.

327
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:43,704
That's got to be tough enough.

328
00:28:44,637 --> 00:28:46,998
Let's hope you know what you're doing.

329
00:28:55,214 --> 00:28:56,080
Gentlemen.

330
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:01,587
Congratulations. You're all we've come to expect... from years of government training.

331
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:06,178
If you'll just follow me, we have one more test. An eye exam.

332
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:21,327
Where are you going?

333
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,698
Hey, man, what the hell is all this?

334
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:28,390
In the mid-. 950s the government started an underfunded agency...

335
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,861
with the simple and laughable purpose of establishing contact... with a race not of this planet.

336
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:35,440
Look directly at the end of this device.

337
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:38,605
Everyone thought the agency was a joke, except the aliens...

338
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:42,131
who made contact March 2, . 96. , outside New York.

339
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:43,690
There were nine of us the first night.

340
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:46,409
Seven agents, one astronomer...

341
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:48,750
and one dumb kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

342
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:51,822
Oh, you brought that tall man some flowers.

343
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:53,515
This way.

344
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,107
They were a group of intergalactic refugees.

345
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,994
Wanted Earth for an apolitical zone for creatures without a planet.

346
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,671
Did you ever see ''Casablanca''?

347
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:04,689
Same thing, except no Nazis.

348
00:30:04,817 --> 00:30:08,186
We agreed and concealed all the evidence of their landing.

349
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:13,476
So these are real flying saucers... and the World's Fair was a cover-up for their landing?

350
00:30:13,493 --> 00:30:14,846
Why else hold it in Queens?

351
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:17,911
More nonhumans arrive every year and live among us in secret.

352
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:23,002
Look, I'm sorry. Not to change the subject... but when was the last time you had a CAT scan?

353
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:24,876
Six months ago. It's company policy.

354
00:30:25,004 --> 00:30:26,771
Make another appointment.

355
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:30,346
Tell your boy Zed I had an absolutely wonderful time...

356
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,601
and thank you for everything but show me the door.

357
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,941
All right. I'm going to get some coffee. You want some coffee?

358
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:38,925
No, thank you, I'm fine.

359
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,855
How you doing, fellas?

360
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:46,693
- Shit! - Okay.

361
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,928
- That's not decaf, is it?

362
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:50,482
- Viennese cinnamon.

363
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:54,860
Don't tell me we only got powdered stuff for cream. I hate that stuff.

364
00:30:56,702 --> 00:30:58,956
Well, that's good. Good. Good.

365
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:01,432
You guys getting along all right?

366
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:04,662
Don't work too hard.

367
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:08,598
So, you guys seen the cahuengas on--

368
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:10,102
Sure you don't want coffee?

369
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:14,757
Cahuengas, yeah, but how about the zapoata?

370
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:18,592
All right, kid, here's the deal.

371
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:22,164
At any given time there are around . ,500 aliens on the planet.

372
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,280
Most of them right here in Manhattan.

373
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:27,492
Most of them are decent enough. Just trying to make a living.

374
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:30,165
- Cab drivers. - Not as many as you'd think.

375
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,832
Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want or need one.

376
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:38,592
They're happy. They think they have a good bead on things.

377
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:41,889
Why the big secret? People are smart. They can handle it.

378
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,190
A person is smart.

379
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:47,446
People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals. You know it.

380
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:50,263
Fifteen hundred years ago, everybody knew...

381
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:52,804
the Earth was the center of the universe.

382
00:31:52,925 --> 00:31:56,436
Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat.

383
00:31:56,496 --> 00:32:00,767
And fifteen minutes ago, you knew that people were alone on this planet.

384
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:04,519
Imagine what you'll know...

385
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:06,153
tomorrow.

386
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:09,894
- What's the catch? - The catch.

387
00:32:11,177 --> 00:32:13,917
The catch is you will sever every human contact.

388
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:17,239
Nobody will ever know you exist anywhere.

389
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,172
Ever.

390
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,614
I'll give you to sunrise to think it over.

391
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,489
Is it worth it?

392
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,091
Yeah, it's worth it...

393
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:38,196
if you're strong enough.

394
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:39,659
What's up, pops?

395
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:51,220
All right, I'm in...

396
00:33:51,385 --> 00:33:54,896
because there's some next-level shit going on here, and I'm with that.

397
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:58,326
But before y'all beam me up, there's a few things to understand.

398
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:00,504
First off, you chose me...

399
00:34:00,628 --> 00:34:02,252
so you recognize the skills.

400
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:06,359
I don't want nobody calling me ''son'' or ''kid'' or ''sport.'' Cool?

401
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,645
Whatever you say, slick.

402
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:10,863
But I need to tell you something about all your skills.

403
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,207
As of right now... As of right now...

404
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:15,710
they mean precisely...

405
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:17,020
dick.

406
00:34:30,424 --> 00:34:31,598
- Purpose of trip?

407
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:33,075
- Diplomatic mission.

408
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,270
- Duration of stay?

409
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:35,781
- Lunch.

410
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,839
Any fruits or vegetables?

411
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,876
You want to stay away from that guy.

412
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:55,474
He's grouchy.

413
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:00,688
Three-hour delay in customs after a . 7 trillion mile trip... gonna make anybody cranky. Right?

414
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:02,740
What branch of the government do we report to?

415
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,598
- None, they ask too many questions. - So who pays for all this?

416
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:10,319
We hold patents on a few gadgets we confiscated from the visitors.

417
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:12,689
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

418
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,709
This is a fascinating little gadget.

419
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:16,560
It'll replace CDs soon.

420
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:18,851
Guess I'll have to buy the ''White Album'' again.

421
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:20,917
That's fun. It's a universal translator.

422
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:23,260
We're not even supposed to have it. I'll tell you why.

423
00:35:23,377 --> 00:35:25,429
Human thought is so primitive it's looked upon...

424
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:28,986
as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies.

425
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:30,924
That kind of makes you proud, doesn't it?

426
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,191
What's this?

427
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,306
Just be calm.

428
00:35:37,491 --> 00:35:38,523
Relax!

429
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,612
Watch your head!

430
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:42,862
Somebody get him some ice.

431
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:46,891
Move!Just move when it's coming at you!

432
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:53,840
Damn!

433
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:56,226
I'm going to pay for that!

434
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:10,647
This thing caused the . 977 New York blackout.

435
00:36:11,193 --> 00:36:13,766
Practical joke by the Great Attractor.

436
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:15,593
He thought it was funny as hell.

437
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:18,287
Sorry, y'all.

438
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:21,055
It was a accident. Sorry.

439
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:23,761
Observation, the heart of our little endeavor.

440
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:26,160
Meet the twins Blblup and Bob.

441
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:29,820
This map shows the location of every registered alien on Earth...

442
00:36:29,877 --> 00:36:31,929
at any given time. Some are under constant surveillance.

443
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,426
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

444
00:36:34,548 --> 00:36:37,609
In public, they're normal as you are, but in private, well...

445
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:39,120
You'll get the idea.

446
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:41,711
Oh, man.

447
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:43,784
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

448
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:47,739
Well, no, it makes perfect sense.

449
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,703
When I was in third grade, everyone said I was crazy...

450
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:53,680
but I knew our teacher was from Venus or something like that.

451
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:55,622
Ms. Edelson.Jupiter, actually.

452
00:36:55,803 --> 00:36:56,906
Well, one of the moons.

453
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:00,789
Class...

454
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:03,681
be quiet and pay attention!

455
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:08,380
If I hae to tell you one more time--

456
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:10,306
Edwards!

457
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:11,729
Let's put it on.

458
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,386
Put what on?

459
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:16,526
The last suit you'll ever wear.

460
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:31,814
You will dress only in attire specially sanctioned...

461
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:33,982
by MIB special serices.

462
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:37,366
You'll conform to the identity we gie you.

463
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:40,363
Eat where we tell you. Lie where we tell you.

464
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:41,951
From now on...

465
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:44,749
you'll hae no identifying marks of any kind.

466
00:37:44,852 --> 00:37:47,557
You'll not stand out in any way.

467
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:49,905
Your entire image is crafted to leae...

468
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:53,084
no lasting memory with anyone you encounter.

469
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:54,362
You are a rumor...

470
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:59,012
recognizable only as deja u and dismissed just as quickly.

471
00:37:59,033 --> 00:38:01,500
You don't exist. You were neer een born.

472
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:06,182
Anonymity is your name.

473
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:08,323
Silence,your natie tongue.

474
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:10,739
You're no longer part of the system.

475
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,768
You're aboe the system. Oer it.

476
00:38:14,216 --> 00:38:15,769
Beyond it.

477
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:18,198
We're ''them. '' We're ''they. ''

478
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:21,984
We are the Men in Black.

479
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:27,431


480
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,994
You know what the difference is between you and me?

481
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:36,911
I make this look good.

482
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:41,226
We're going to go for a ride.

483
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:44,883
I'll put you down here for a minute then Daddy will be right back.

484
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:19,532
Okay, now we're ready to go for a little ride.

485
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:23,540
We're going to meet with Daddy's friend who you'll like.

486
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:28,303
Let's see.

487
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:29,957
Bee...

488
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:32,485
we've got the deposed sur-prefect of Singalee...

489
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:35,651
touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight.

490
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:36,733
- Humanoid?

491
00:39:36,897 --> 00:39:38,487
- You wish. Bring a sponge.

492
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,780
And here. Red letter from last night.

493
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:45,494
We had an unauthorized landing somewhere in upstate New York.

494
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,684
Kay, keep your ears open on this one.

495
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:51,391
We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger down here.

496
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:54,677
Well, we got a skimmer.

497
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:57,034
Landed alien out of zone. Who is it?

498
00:39:57,151 --> 00:39:58,219
Redgick.

499
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:00,471
He's not cleared to leave Manhattan...

500
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:02,913
but he's way out of town now, stuck on the New Jersey Turnpike.

501
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:05,805
Why don't you take junior with you?

502
00:40:05,926 --> 00:40:08,702
This is a good one for him to warm up on.

503
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:10,331
Go get him, tiger.

504
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:16,678


505
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:19,878
''We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger.''

506
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:22,563
Zed.

507
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:24,660
He just...

508
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,783
Unlimited technology from the whole universe...

509
00:40:28,783 --> 00:40:31,910
and we cruise around in a Ford P.O.S.

510
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:36,087
Fasten your seat belt.

511
00:40:36,824 --> 00:40:38,484
We got to work on your people skills.

512
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:41,437
You'd get a much better reaction if you were more polite.

513
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:42,703
- Fasten your seat belt, please.

514
00:40:43,197 --> 00:40:45,035
- Good. Did you hurt yourself?

515
00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:51,507
Oh, the red button there. Don't ever, ever touch it.

516
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:05,265
All right, pop, that'll be $72 there.

517
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,124
Okay, sweetie, let me pay the impolite driver.

518
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:43,234


519
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:45,831


520
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:49,046


521
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,198


522
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:55,592


523
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:57,266


524
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,613


525
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:03,411


526
00:42:03,511 --> 00:42:04,791


527
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:09,062


528
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,614
Six is up!

529
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:16,063
- Where is Ivan?

530
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:17,777
- Gave him a break.

531
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:31,593


532
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:33,724


533
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:44,141
You can kill us both, but you will not find the galaxy.

534
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:47,276
You're right about one thing.

535
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:03,234
You're not going anywhere, pal.

536
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:08,106
What's going on?

537
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:22,409
I'd like to see your license and registration, please.

538
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:29,328
Like to see your other license and registration, please.

539
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:40,165
You're restricted to Manhattan. Where are you going, Redgie?

540
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:43,477
It's my wife. She's-- Well, look.

541
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:49,394
All right. No big deal.

542
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,732
Okay, you come with me, Redge.

543
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:56,106
And you handle this.

544
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:57,124
What! Me?

545
00:43:57,825 --> 00:43:59,248
It's easy. You just catch.

546
00:43:59,393 --> 00:44:01,196
- He knows what he's doing? - He does it all the time.

547
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:02,538
Let the man work.

548
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:13,425
Damn, man! So-- Something's peaking!

549
00:44:13,808 --> 00:44:16,654
Croagg the midwife is at 54th and Madison.

550
00:44:16,743 --> 00:44:18,795
You're headed out of town. What's going on?

551
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:20,087
- We're meeting someone.

552
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:21,315
- Who you meeting?

553
00:44:21,482 --> 00:44:22,347
It's a ship.

554
00:44:22,516 --> 00:44:24,568
I saw no departure clearance for today.

555
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:25,694
- You didn't? - No.

556
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:28,178
- It's an emergency. - Kay! Kay!

557
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:30,113
- You're doing fine, ace. - Kiss my ass!

558
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:33,160
What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet?

559
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,695
Excuse me, miss.

560
00:44:34,695 --> 00:44:37,020
We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.

561
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:39,076
Some of the new arrivals.

562
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,711
New arrivals? Have anything to do with the crash last night?

563
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:44,192
Excuse me, miss!

564
00:44:47,774 --> 00:44:49,328
Oh, man.

565
00:44:49,844 --> 00:44:51,611
Oh, man!

566
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:54,622
Look.

567
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:56,619
Oh, man.

568
00:44:58,051 --> 00:45:00,304
Congratulations, Redge. It's a...

569
00:45:01,122 --> 00:45:02,093
squid.

570
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:06,865
He's...

571
00:45:07,794 --> 00:45:09,775
actually kind of...

572
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:17,278
cute.

573
00:45:25,146 --> 00:45:27,364
Anything about that seem unusual to you?

574
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:31,577
What would scare Redgick so badly

575
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:34,079
he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?

576
00:45:34,655 --> 00:45:36,672
We'll check the hot sheets.

577
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:42,147


578
00:45:42,262 --> 00:45:43,507
These are the hot sheets?

579
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:45,811
Best investigative reporting on the planet.

580
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:49,195
Read the '' New York Times'' if you want. They get lucky sometimes.

581
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:53,267
I cannot believe you're looking for tips in the supermarket tabloids.

582
00:45:54,508 --> 00:45:56,168
Not looking for.

583
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,750
Found.

584
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,747
Wait, slow down.

585
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:14,860
Why?

586
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:18,148
Give her time to get the wrong impression. Makes things smoother.

587
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:20,896
Can I help you, gentlemen?

588
00:46:21,034 --> 00:46:24,580
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, with the F.B.I.

589
00:46:24,638 --> 00:46:26,406
We'd like to talk about your visitor.

590
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,070
You here to make fun of me too?

591
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:32,408
We at the F.B.I. do not have a sense of humor we're aware of. May we come in?

592
00:46:33,648 --> 00:46:35,035
Sure.

593
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:36,663
- Thank you. - Lemonade?

594
00:46:36,817 --> 00:46:38,276
Oh, yes, please.

595
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:45,393
The chief of police himself come up to the house...

596
00:46:45,493 --> 00:46:47,569
and did a full-out professional investigation.

597
00:46:47,995 --> 00:46:51,257
Took a police report and writ down everything I said...

598
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:53,240
from A to Z, not believing one thing I said.

599
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:55,203
Sort of poking fun at me.

600
00:46:55,335 --> 00:46:57,588
Then they asked, ''If he was murdered...

601
00:46:57,738 --> 00:47:00,241
how was he able to walk back in the house?''

602
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,294
I gotta admit to you that one got me sorta stumped.

603
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:06,314
But I know Edgar and that wasn't Edgar.

604
00:47:07,682 --> 00:47:10,801
It was like something was wearing Edgar.

605
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:13,967
Like a suit.

606
00:47:14,588 --> 00:47:16,047
An Edgar suit.

607
00:47:23,597 --> 00:47:26,373
Dude was that ugly before he was an alien.

608
00:47:29,202 --> 00:47:31,147
I'm sorry.

609
00:47:31,371 --> 00:47:32,474
Go on.

610
00:47:33,441 --> 00:47:34,721
Anyway...

611
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:37,022
I come to and he's gone.

612
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:38,952
- Did he say anything?

613
00:47:39,246 --> 00:47:40,112
- Yes.

614
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,118
He asked me for some water.

615
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:44,626
Some sugar water.

616
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:46,125
- Sugar water?

617
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:49,382
- Yeah, I remember that right.'Cause I thought that was odd.

618
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:53,899
That he asked me for sugar water and not lemonade or ice water or...

619
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:55,477
regular water or...

620
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:56,945
tap water.

621
00:47:57,964 --> 00:48:00,811
All right, Beatrice. There was no alien.

622
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:03,368
The flash of light you saw in the sky was not a U.F.O.

623
00:48:03,471 --> 00:48:07,974
Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket... and refracted the light from Venus.

624
00:48:07,974 --> 00:48:09,327
Wait a minute.

625
00:48:09,477 --> 00:48:13,082
You flash that thing it erases her memory and you just make up a new one?

626
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:15,020
A standard-issue neuralizer.

627
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:17,853
That weak-ass story is the best you can come up with?

628
00:48:18,085 --> 00:48:18,986
All right.

629
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:20,646
On a more personal note,

630
00:48:21,254 --> 00:48:25,109
Edgar ran off with an old girlfriend.You'll go stay with your mom a couple nights.

631
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:26,617
You'll get over it and decide you're better off.

632
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:30,580
Yeah, because he never appreciated you anyway.

633
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:33,014
In fact, you know what?

634
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:36,083
You kicked him out. And now that he's gone...

635
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:39,431
you'll go into town, find yourself some nice dresses.

636
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:43,813
Get yourself some shoes. Find somewhere you could get a facial.

637
00:48:43,844 --> 00:48:45,018
And...

638
00:48:45,178 --> 00:48:48,582
hire a decorator to come here quick because, damn!

639
00:48:55,222 --> 00:48:56,590
Yo, Kay, check it out.

640
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,500
When do I get my own flashy...

641
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,119
memory messer-upper thing?

642
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,398
When you grow up.

643
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:06,468
Please, not green.

644
00:49:07,868 --> 00:49:10,538
Damn.

645
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:13,598
I don't suppose you know what kind of alien life-form...leaves a green spectral trail

646
00:49:13,673 --> 00:49:15,167
and craves sugar water?

647
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:18,303
Wait. That was on '' FinalJeopardy'' last night.

648
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:20,136
- Damn, Alex said it was--

649
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,940
- Zed, we have a bug.

650
00:49:22,616 --> 00:49:23,791
So.

651
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,480
What? We don't like bugs?

652
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,873
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

653
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:31,408
They consume, infest, destroy,

654
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:32,807
live off the destruction of other species.

655
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:35,035
- You were stung as a child, right? - Listen, kid.

656
00:49:35,463 --> 00:49:39,353
Imagine a giant cockroach with unlimited strength...

657
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:43,254
a massive inferiority complex, and a real short temper...

658
00:49:43,303 --> 00:49:46,743
is tear-assing around Manhattan Island in a brand-new Edgar suit.

659
00:49:47,642 --> 00:49:48,957
Sound like fun?

660
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:52,454
What's the move?

661
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:56,010
With the bug in town, we'll watch the morgues.

662
00:50:08,161 --> 00:50:10,308
Where do you want contestant number three?

663
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:11,960
Just leave it there.

664
00:50:12,098 --> 00:50:13,166
What's with the cat?

665
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,594
There's a problem with the cat. Sign here.

666
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:19,588
- What's the problem with the cat? - It's your problem.

667
00:50:22,777 --> 00:50:24,401
I hate the living.

668
00:50:26,346 --> 00:50:27,734
Shall we?

669
00:50:57,377 --> 00:50:59,286
Oh, my God!

670
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:05,392
Buddy, what are you?

671
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:17,167
Subject was approximately . . 2 degrees at time of autopsy...

672
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,555
indicating an increase in body temperature.

673
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:23,972
Examiner tried to verify this rectally...only to find the subject was without rectum.

674
00:51:24,005 --> 00:51:25,534
- Which is, needless to say, really--

675
00:51:25,672 --> 00:51:26,703
- Weird.

676
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:31,570
I'm Dr. Leo Manville, Department of Public Health.This is Dr. White.

677
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:34,897
You boys must not have much of a home life.

678
00:51:35,016 --> 00:51:38,349
We watch the morgues very carefully. Seen something unusual?

679
00:51:38,418 --> 00:51:40,814
I'd say so. Triple homicide.

680
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:42,757
The first body was pretty normal, except he was broken in half.

681
00:51:42,757 --> 00:51:44,381
The first body was pretty normal, except he was broken in half.

682
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:47,406
But when I opened up the other two, well--

683
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:48,669
Let me show you.

684
00:51:54,935 --> 00:51:58,541
There's a skeletal structure unlike any I've ever seen before.

685
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:00,064
I'll look at it.

686
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:02,424
Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?

687
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:03,930
This way, Doctor.

688
00:52:04,544 --> 00:52:06,525
This one's even stranger.

689
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,554
I did a full laparotomy.

690
00:52:08,715 --> 00:52:10,447
I began with the stomach.

691
00:52:10,584 --> 00:52:13,740
We can start with the gastroesophageal junction.Whichever you prefer.

692
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:17,914
Let's start wherever you started at.

693
00:52:18,224 --> 00:52:19,612
Okeydokey.

694
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:30,104
- Your cat? - Guess it is now.

695
00:52:30,236 --> 00:52:32,703
It came in with the body. Dive right in.

696
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:34,195
I'm sure he won't mind.

697
00:52:37,979 --> 00:52:39,995
You have really pretty eyes.

698
00:52:40,915 --> 00:52:42,124
Thank you.

699
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:46,760
Feel that?

700
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,040
Where the pyloric junction would be? Push it aside.

701
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:53,585
Notice anything strange? Stomach, liver, lungs?

702
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,798
No, all fine.

703
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:57,553
Doctor, they're all missing.

704
00:52:58,164 --> 00:52:59,173
Well, of course.

705
00:52:59,332 --> 00:53:02,558
That's obviously the first thing I noticed.

706
00:53:02,837 --> 00:53:05,956
What I was pointing out is the fact that there are no...

707
00:53:07,008 --> 00:53:08,395
pieces...

708
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:10,162
of them left.

709
00:53:10,343 --> 00:53:13,297
You know, so they're intact.

710
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:15,236
Wherever they are. Whole, somewhere.

711
00:53:15,515 --> 00:53:17,211
That we can be sure of.

712
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,738
Have we met before?

713
00:53:19,452 --> 00:53:21,778
I'm having the strangest feeling of deja vu.

714
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:25,455
- Yeah, me too. - Really?

715
00:53:26,192 --> 00:53:28,766
Okay, you want to know what I really think?

716
00:53:28,863 --> 00:53:30,559
But don't tell him, he's under enough stress.

717
00:53:30,697 --> 00:53:32,500
I don't think it's a real body.

718
00:53:32,632 --> 00:53:35,966
I think it's some kind of transport unit for something else altogether.

719
00:53:36,037 --> 00:53:37,946
The question is, what?

720
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:40,365
Is this freaking you out?

721
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:44,197
No, girl.

722
00:53:46,047 --> 00:53:48,300
You know what I like to do sometimes when it's late?

723
00:53:51,484 --> 00:53:52,694
No.

724
00:53:53,386 --> 00:53:54,774
Dr. White.

725
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:57,877
Excuse me.

726
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,705
What do you think?

727
00:54:04,065 --> 00:54:07,778
Very interesting. She got a real Queen-of-the-Undead thing going--

728
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:09,079
- Of the body.

729
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:10,101
- Great body.

730
00:54:10,336 --> 00:54:11,961
The dead body.

731
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:14,577
Man, you have to look at that thing.

732
00:54:15,008 --> 00:54:16,632
You recognize him?

733
00:54:17,178 --> 00:54:20,855
Yeah, he looks like the big guy I saw down at headquarters, only deader.

734
00:54:20,915 --> 00:54:22,124
What do you think killed him?

735
00:54:23,516 --> 00:54:24,548
- A bug? - Dr. White.

736
00:54:25,352 --> 00:54:26,739
You're up, slugger.

737
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,971
Look at this.

738
00:54:33,693 --> 00:54:35,318
What the hell is that?

739
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,182
Must...

740
00:54:56,883 --> 00:54:58,508
To prevent...

741
00:55:01,222 --> 00:55:03,203
contest.

742
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:05,749
It's okay. What are you trying to say?

743
00:55:05,892 --> 00:55:07,422
To prevent...

744
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,114
''To prevent...''

745
00:55:09,295 --> 00:55:10,505
Struggle?

746
00:55:11,132 --> 00:55:12,626
No.

747
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,008
To prevent...

748
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:15,432
War?

749
00:55:15,635 --> 00:55:17,023
War.

750
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:21,026
The galaxy...

751
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:24,211
...is on...

752
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:26,559
...Orion's...

753
00:55:28,982 --> 00:55:29,847
...be- be--

754
00:55:32,752 --> 00:55:34,211
What is word?

755
00:55:34,821 --> 00:55:36,209
The bed?

756
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:38,839
Belt? Orion's belt?

757
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:02,658
''To prevent war the galaxy is on Orion's belt.''

758
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:04,492
What the hell does that mean?

759
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:09,651
Doctor...

760
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:11,034
- whatever, come here!

761
00:56:11,192 --> 00:56:15,189
- Dr. ''Whatever''?You guys aren't really from the Department of Health, are you?

762
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:17,580
Rosenberg! Ah, damn.

763
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:22,145
The Arquillians will not like this. He was one of the royal family.

764
00:56:22,203 --> 00:56:23,555
I knew it. This is an alien.

765
00:56:23,703 --> 00:56:27,249
And you're from some government agency trying to keep it under wraps.

766
00:56:27,307 --> 00:56:30,640
He said, ''To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt.''

767
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:32,979
This makes total sense. How else do you explain New York?

768
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:35,577
The other day I was in this cab and this guy--

769
00:56:37,384 --> 00:56:39,709
''Galaxy on Orion's belt'' doesn't make sense.

770
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:42,322
That's what the little dude inside the big dude's head said. Right?

771
00:56:42,322 --> 00:56:43,710
Right after--

772
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,086
Damn, man. You did the flashy thing already.

773
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,971
Whoever you are, you have to show I.D. if you're gonna be in the morgue.

774
00:56:50,063 --> 00:56:53,159
Of course, young lady. Look at this for me, please.

775
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:55,286
- Would you stop that? - What?

776
00:56:55,402 --> 00:56:58,142
That thing is gonna give her brain cancer or something.

777
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,307
Never hurt her before. We have to close all the doors here.Special Services will be here any minute.

778
00:57:02,342 --> 00:57:05,331
'' Before''! How many times have you flashy-thinged that poor woman?

779
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:06,420
Couple.

780
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:09,806
- No worries about no long-term damage? - Little.

781
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,968
- Have you ever flashy-thinged me? - No.

782
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:14,623
- I ain't playing with you! Have you? - No.

783
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:27,531
I think I should be in charge of the flashy thing department.

784
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,130
Not while I'm around, ace.

785
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:31,594
You won't be happy till you fricassee someone's brain out.

786
00:57:31,705 --> 00:57:35,773
We got two dead aliens and a Deputy Medical Examiner...- that needs a new memory. - Yes, sir.

787
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:40,354
Make it a happy memory.

788
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:15,894
Where is it?

789
00:58:37,937 --> 00:58:42,101


790
00:58:49,716 --> 00:58:51,554


791
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,403


792
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,178
Hey, Zed.

793
00:59:01,627 --> 00:59:04,616
Doesn't anyone ever get any sleep around here?

794
00:59:04,698 --> 00:59:08,826
The twins keep us on Centaurian time. It's a 37-hour day.

795
00:59:08,868 --> 00:59:11,157
Give it a few months, you'll get used to it.

796
00:59:11,271 --> 00:59:13,038
Or have a psychotic episode.

797
00:59:13,473 --> 00:59:14,338
Here's Orion.

798
00:59:14,808 --> 00:59:17,963
It's a grouping of the brightest stars in the northern sky.

799
00:59:18,044 --> 00:59:20,784
- And here's Orion's belt. - That's what the little guy said.

800
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,486
''To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt.''

801
00:59:24,551 --> 00:59:27,124
Junior, there are no galaxies on Orion's belt.

802
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:30,933
The belt is just these three stars.Galaxies are huge.

803
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:35,154
They're made up of billions of stars.You heard wrong.

804
00:59:35,895 --> 00:59:38,433
Look, whatever, I know what I heard.

805
01:00:15,435 --> 01:00:16,823
Pretty lady.

806
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:20,927


807
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:28,062
The grumpy guy's story is starting to come into focus a little bit here.

808
01:00:28,548 --> 01:00:31,917
You were the guy in the picture you showed me with the flowers.

809
01:00:32,718 --> 01:00:36,193
And, I take it, she never got those flowers.

810
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,744
So, what, she ever get married or anything?

811
01:00:40,894 --> 01:00:43,811
You know what they say.''It's better to have loved and lost

812
01:00:43,897 --> 01:00:45,878
than never to have loved at all.''

813
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:47,502
Try it.

814
01:00:53,139 --> 01:00:54,313
Take a look at this.

815
01:00:54,474 --> 01:00:56,098
My God, they're all leaving.

816
01:00:56,242 --> 01:01:00,311
We've had . 2 jump in the last hour. Redgick was just the first.

817
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:03,021
What do they know that we don't?

818
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:04,679
Why does a rat desert a ship?

819
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:08,815
Give me Lem Sat 4 with a proton induction thermoscan, please.

820
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:13,028
Thank you. Okay. Lem Sat . 8.

821
01:01:14,994 --> 01:01:16,310
All right, 4,000.

822
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:22,018
- That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

823
01:01:22,168 --> 01:01:24,944
- We've got a dead Arquillian prince.

824
01:01:26,606 --> 01:01:28,160
Speak of the devil.

825
01:01:29,175 --> 01:01:30,184
They sound pissed.

826
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:32,003
Boys, translate that. Step on it.

827
01:01:32,178 --> 01:01:35,819
Go to Rosenberg's jewelry store and see what you can turn up.

828
01:01:41,855 --> 01:01:42,993
Give the kid a weapon.

829
01:01:52,698 --> 01:01:54,227
- Series 4 de-atomizer.

830
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:57,072
- That's what I'm talking about.Noisy cricket.

831
01:01:59,972 --> 01:02:02,083
Kay, no, no, come on, man.

832
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:04,878
You get a Series 4 de-atomizer...

833
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:06,080
I get a midget cricket?

834
01:02:10,816 --> 01:02:12,797
Feel like I'm going to break this damn thing.

835
01:02:57,197 --> 01:02:59,866
Hey, this is my truck!

836
01:03:00,533 --> 01:03:03,831
Make sure you tell them that down at the impound.

837
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:13,024
Please.

838
01:03:22,455 --> 01:03:26,002
Who breaks into a jewelry store and leaves all the jewels?

839
01:03:26,058 --> 01:03:27,338
Somebody not looking for jewelry.

840
01:03:29,562 --> 01:03:32,232
He had a serious crush on his cat.

841
01:03:34,634 --> 01:03:35,606
Get down!

842
01:03:40,906 --> 01:03:42,116
Man!

843
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:45,956
That's him. That's the bug!

844
01:03:46,078 --> 01:03:47,466
In the Edgar suit!

845
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:11,930
We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public!

846
01:04:12,004 --> 01:04:14,222
We ain't got time for this cover-up bullshit!

847
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,843
Have you forgotten? There's an alien battle cruiser--

848
01:04:16,942 --> 01:04:20,097
There's always an alien battle cruiser or a Korilian death ray...

849
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,097
or an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet.

850
01:04:23,183 --> 01:04:26,208
The only way people get on with their happy lives...

851
01:04:26,286 --> 01:04:29,132
is they do not know about it!

852
01:04:33,626 --> 01:04:35,608
Don't worry about the bug.

853
01:04:35,861 --> 01:04:38,114
He's not leaving town. We've got his ship.

854
01:04:46,038 --> 01:04:48,256
Zed, we need a containment crew...

855
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:50,213
on MacDougal Street south of Houston.

856
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:54,773
Containment may be a moot point, friend. The exodus continues.

857
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:58,492
It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.

858
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:01,327
You sorry little ingrates!

859
01:05:09,328 --> 01:05:11,060
What about the Arquillians?

860
01:05:11,231 --> 01:05:14,944
We've only translated part of the message so far:- '' Deliver the galaxy.''

861
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,068
- They don't want much, do they?

862
01:05:16,236 --> 01:05:18,217
Oh, it gets better.

863
01:05:18,337 --> 01:05:19,926
They hold us responsible.

864
01:05:20,072 --> 01:05:24,591


865
01:05:28,748 --> 01:05:31,073
Where do you keep your dead?

866
01:05:31,183 --> 01:05:32,807
I don't have any dead.

867
01:05:33,352 --> 01:05:34,526
Where?

868
01:05:34,688 --> 01:05:35,862
I don't know.

869
01:05:36,021 --> 01:05:38,168
The city morgue?

870
01:05:48,535 --> 01:05:51,037
That's three for a dollar, sir!

871
01:05:51,538 --> 01:05:54,633
It was some light that refracted off of Venus...

872
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:56,297
into some swamp gas...

873
01:05:56,443 --> 01:05:58,067
and that's what made the--

874
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,669
All right, kid!

875
01:06:00,379 --> 01:06:01,908
Excuse me. What's up?

876
01:06:02,047 --> 01:06:04,965
The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means.

877
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,888
We need help, a professional.

878
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:09,830
Somebody with years of experience in intergalactic politics.

879
01:06:10,457 --> 01:06:13,093
I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town.

880
01:06:13,093 --> 01:06:15,346
May I hae your attention? Thank you.

881
01:06:15,562 --> 01:06:17,506
If you'll gather oer here.

882
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:20,925
That's right, moe in closer. That's good.

883
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:24,045
If you look right here, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

884
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:39,882
That's the worse disguise ever. He's obviously an alien.

885
01:06:40,311 --> 01:06:43,194
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry little butt.

886
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:44,579
You busy, Frank?

887
01:06:44,882 --> 01:06:47,349
Can't talk now. My flight's leaving in--

888
01:06:47,452 --> 01:06:48,317
- Get your paws off me!

889
01:06:48,486 --> 01:06:49,839
- Call the pound! We got a stray.

890
01:06:49,987 --> 01:06:52,276
The dog owes my friend money.

891
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,015
Arquillians and bugs, Frank, what do you know?

892
01:06:54,158 --> 01:06:55,510
- Nothing. - Nothing?

893
01:06:58,396 --> 01:07:01,101
Stop it. Stop it. Okay. Okay.

894
01:07:01,232 --> 01:07:03,629
Rosenberg wasn't some two-bit Arquillian.

895
01:07:03,734 --> 01:07:07,174
He was the guardian of a whole galaxy. They thought he'd be safe on Earth.

896
01:07:07,238 --> 01:07:08,342
The bug had other plans.

897
01:07:08,506 --> 01:07:12,469
The galaxy is the best source for subatomic energy in the universe.

898
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,428
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians good-bye.

899
01:07:15,513 --> 01:07:16,866
Ask about the belt.

900
01:07:17,014 --> 01:07:19,647
Rosenberg mentioned a galaxy on Orion's belt.

901
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,758
- What's he mean? - Beats me.

902
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:23,560
Not around.

903
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:28,604
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

904
01:07:28,726 --> 01:07:30,707
The galaxy is here!

905
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:32,295
What do you mean ''here''?

906
01:07:32,463 --> 01:07:35,203
Galaxy's millions of stars and planets. How's it here?

907
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:37,932
You humans! When will you learn size doesn't matter?

908
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:41,457
Just because something's important, doesn't mean it's not very small.

909
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:42,743
- How small?

910
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:45,054
- Tiny. Like a marble or a jewel.

911
01:07:45,476 --> 01:07:48,251
If you'll excuse me, I gotta be walked before my flight.

912
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:49,277
All right. Get out of here.

913
01:07:51,816 --> 01:07:55,292
If the galaxy's here, it's not on Orion's belt.

914
01:08:15,439 --> 01:08:17,586
Boy, when you want attention--

915
01:08:18,976 --> 01:08:19,841
Orion.

916
01:08:20,011 --> 01:08:21,849
That's a pretty name.

917
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,905
What's this?

918
01:09:18,336 --> 01:09:20,554
Yes, good, thank you.

919
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:24,040
Thank you for making sure the bell works.

920
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,242
What's up, FarmerJohn?

921
01:09:29,747 --> 01:09:32,451
A man came in here earlier.

922
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:33,818
A dead man.

923
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:36,035
And that means what to me?

924
01:09:38,021 --> 01:09:40,975
It was a very dear friend of mine.

925
01:09:41,592 --> 01:09:43,810
I believe he had an animal with him.

926
01:09:43,928 --> 01:09:46,598
It was a gift I gave him. A pet cat.

927
01:09:46,697 --> 01:09:48,464
It means worlds to me.

928
01:09:48,599 --> 01:09:50,472
I'd like to have it back.

929
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:52,474
I'm gonna need a picture I.D...

930
01:09:52,603 --> 01:09:54,132
written proof of ownership of the cat...

931
01:09:54,272 --> 01:09:57,950
notarized proof of kinship with...the deceased.

932
01:09:58,776 --> 01:10:00,270
Don't do that.

933
01:10:01,946 --> 01:10:03,050
Do what?

934
01:10:04,215 --> 01:10:05,769
Don't do it.

935
01:10:08,286 --> 01:10:09,674
Oh, man.

936
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:16,229


937
01:10:25,303 --> 01:10:27,699
- Look, Kay, let me handle this one. - What?

938
01:10:27,805 --> 01:10:30,829
All we gotta do is get a cat. It's not really that hard.

939
01:10:30,908 --> 01:10:35,391
But if you go in, you'll lay yourJack Webb on her.Flash your brain ray all in her face.

940
01:10:35,413 --> 01:10:37,181
She'll wind up with leukemia.

941
01:10:37,315 --> 01:10:41,277
She's a doctor. She don't need you flashing away her med school classes.

942
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:42,707
- Five minutes. - Two minutes.

943
01:10:45,156 --> 01:10:46,259
- Where's the animal?

944
01:10:46,424 --> 01:10:48,013
- I told you I don't know.

945
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,369
Let's see if we can find it.

946
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:56,971
Hello!

947
01:11:06,177 --> 01:11:07,387
Hello!

948
01:11:11,782 --> 01:11:12,991
- How you doing? - Hello.

949
01:11:13,517 --> 01:11:16,613
I'm Sergeant Friday, from the 26th precinct.

950
01:11:16,687 --> 01:11:19,427
A cat came in with a corpse the other day.

951
01:11:19,523 --> 01:11:21,741
- ''Orion'' on the name tag. - Yes, that's right.

952
01:11:21,859 --> 01:11:23,768
This cat is a...

953
01:11:24,528 --> 01:11:25,536
a witness

954
01:11:25,696 --> 01:11:26,949
in a murder case.I'm gonna need to take him,

955
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,366
ask him a few questions.

956
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:30,026
- I don't know where the cat is.

957
01:11:30,201 --> 01:11:31,589
- You don't?

958
01:11:32,035 --> 01:11:34,882
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.

959
01:11:36,807 --> 01:11:39,903
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

960
01:11:39,977 --> 01:11:41,886
I'd really like to go with you...

961
01:11:42,146 --> 01:11:43,177
now.

962
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:46,583
And exactly why is that?

963
01:11:53,758 --> 01:11:55,834
There's something I need to show you.

964
01:11:56,327 --> 01:11:57,359
Slow down, girl.

965
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:01,001
You ain't got to hit the gas like that.

966
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:03,390
You don't understand. You really need to see this.

967
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:08,365
I will, I will. One thing, I got to drive. It's not some macho trip.

968
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:10,815
I'm saying that's the way I get down.

969
01:12:21,919 --> 01:12:24,350
Look, stud, you're really not getting this.

970
01:12:24,455 --> 01:12:26,743
There's something I need you to help me with.

971
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:39,912
- Freeze it, bug!

972
01:12:40,104 --> 01:12:41,242
- Christ, you are thick!

973
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:42,613
- How was I to know?

974
01:12:42,807 --> 01:12:44,052
- Should I have sung it for you?

975
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,868
If you weren't coming on like--

976
01:12:46,043 --> 01:12:50,111
That is so typical. A woman shows a hint of sexual independence--

977
01:12:50,147 --> 01:12:51,012
- Shut up!

978
01:12:51,182 --> 01:12:52,048
- Let her go, shiteater.

979
01:12:52,216 --> 01:12:54,125
Listen, monkey-boy.

980
01:12:54,285 --> 01:12:57,619
Compared to you humans, I'm on the top rung of the evolutionary ladder.

981
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:58,860
- So can it.

982
01:12:59,056 --> 01:13:01,689
- You're breaking my heart.Show me your face and I'll cure all your ills.

983
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:05,405
Ever pull wings off a fly? Care to see the fly get even?

984
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:06,957
How far can you go with no ship?

985
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:10,155
If that's what you call that space trash we got locked in the office.

986
01:13:10,234 --> 01:13:12,807
- Put your weapons down! - Never going to happen, insect.

987
01:13:12,903 --> 01:13:13,768
- It's okay.

988
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:15,660
- How is it okay?

989
01:13:15,806 --> 01:13:18,024
I'm saying it's going to be okay.

990
01:13:18,175 --> 01:13:20,156
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

991
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,480
Let me go!

992
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:43,649
Go on!

993
01:13:47,605 --> 01:13:48,958
- Take me here.

994
01:13:49,106 --> 01:13:49,971
- No way.

995
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:52,340
Take me!

996
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,226
He's in a cab!

997
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:36,154
Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

998
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:38,805
Hey, man, what?

999
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,202
He's not leaving the planet in a cab.

1000
01:14:51,335 --> 01:14:52,200
Let's go.

1001
01:14:57,074 --> 01:14:59,920
Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan.

1002
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:02,442
If it's not human, I don't want it to leave this island.

1003
01:15:03,681 --> 01:15:05,378
What do we hear from our friends upstairs?

1004
01:15:05,516 --> 01:15:06,939
Same thing. '' Deliver the galaxy.''

1005
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:10,073
The bug has the galaxy but we have his ship. He's looking for a way out.

1006
01:15:13,123 --> 01:15:16,563
Warning. Protonic fusion detection.

1007
01:15:21,065 --> 01:15:23,496


1008
01:15:23,601 --> 01:15:25,261
What the hell they shooting at us for?

1009
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:26,268
Battle rules, kid.

1010
01:15:26,437 --> 01:15:30,885
First, we get an ultimatum...then a warning shot, then a galactic standard week to respond.

1011
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:33,944
A galactic standard week? How long is that?

1012
01:15:34,044 --> 01:15:35,147
One hour.

1013
01:15:35,546 --> 01:15:36,755
One hour?

1014
01:15:37,214 --> 01:15:38,317
Then what?

1015
01:15:40,985 --> 01:15:45,019


1016
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:49,254
That's bullshit. Kid, to keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.

1017
01:15:49,293 --> 01:15:50,681
And whatever planet it's on.

1018
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:54,485
- You're talking about us.

1019
01:15:54,632 --> 01:15:56,127
- Sucks, huh?

1020
01:15:58,636 --> 01:16:01,661
I'm getting the location of every interstellar vehicle within . 00 miles.

1021
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:04,027
I already did. Frank took the last ship.

1022
01:16:04,141 --> 01:16:07,095
- Snedens Landing and Throg's Neck. - They're gone.

1023
01:16:07,177 --> 01:16:08,316
- Atlantic City. - Adios.

1024
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:10,008
- Bayonne? - Gone.

1025
01:16:10,147 --> 01:16:12,887
- There's Three Mile Island. - Gone.

1026
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:15,165
- Y'all. - Staten Island?- Gone, thank God. - Fellas!

1027
01:16:15,486 --> 01:16:18,855
We're running out of time. If the bug leaves with the galaxy--

1028
01:16:18,922 --> 01:16:20,761
Hey, old guys!

1029
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:27,395
Do those still work?

1030
01:16:42,846 --> 01:16:44,863
- You're coming with me. - What?

1031
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:47,251
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

1032
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:48,389
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

1033
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:55,365
Wait, the tunnel?

1034
01:16:55,526 --> 01:16:57,435
- You know a better way to Queens?

1035
01:16:57,561 --> 01:16:58,462
- It's gonna be packed.

1036
01:16:58,629 --> 01:17:00,705


1037
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,263
- Remember the little red button? - Yeah.

1038
01:17:13,811 --> 01:17:15,507
Push the red button.

1039
01:17:16,146 --> 01:17:17,640
You may want to wear a seat belt.

1040
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,865
You're much too tense. You're a young man.

1041
01:17:32,963 --> 01:17:34,872
You need to relax. Learn to take some joy in your work.

1042
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:36,208
You like music?

1043
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,503


1044
01:17:37,668 --> 01:17:38,771
Man!

1045
01:17:40,337 --> 01:17:41,440
That's better.

1046
01:18:12,936 --> 01:18:14,810
You do know Elvis is dead?

1047
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:17,536
No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.

1048
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,379
You don't want to eat me.

1049
01:18:34,558 --> 01:18:37,547
I'm important on my planet. A queen!

1050
01:18:37,628 --> 01:18:41,233
A goddess, even. There are those who worship me.

1051
01:18:41,331 --> 01:18:44,321
I'm not trying to impress you.Just letting you know it could start a war!

1052
01:18:44,968 --> 01:18:47,638
Good, war. That means more food for my family.

1053
01:18:47,738 --> 01:18:51,284
All 7 8 million of them.- That's a lot of mouths to feed.

1054
01:18:51,341 --> 01:18:54,082
- Wonderful, but I'm staying here!

1055
01:19:15,599 --> 01:19:17,852
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

1056
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:20,945
Roaches check in.

1057
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,214
But they don't check out.

1058
01:19:29,046 --> 01:19:30,255
Warning.

1059
01:19:30,614 --> 01:19:33,117
Eight minutes to the destruction of Earth.

1060
01:19:34,785 --> 01:19:36,173
Eight minutes

1061
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,672
to destruction.

1062
01:20:22,766 --> 01:20:25,791
We'll use pulsar level 5, with a sub-sonic implosion factor.

1063
01:20:25,869 --> 01:20:27,043
What?

1064
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:30,286
Just shoot the damn thing on the count of three. One...

1065
01:20:30,374 --> 01:20:32,141
two, three.

1066
01:21:32,336 --> 01:21:33,960
You idiots!

1067
01:21:35,172 --> 01:21:37,081
You don't get it!

1068
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,105
I've won.

1069
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:39,042
It's over

1070
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:40,810
It's over. .

1071
01:21:41,178 --> 01:21:43,159
You milk suckers!

1072
01:21:43,747 --> 01:21:45,407
You don't matter.

1073
01:21:45,682 --> 01:21:48,280
In a few seconds, you won't even be matter.

1074
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:51,442
You're under arrest for violating sections of the Tycho Treaty.

1075
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:54,261
So hand over whatever galaxy you are carrying and step away...

1076
01:21:54,358 --> 01:21:57,204
from your busted-ass vehicle and put your hands on your head.

1077
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:03,941
I'll put my hands...

1078
01:22:06,436 --> 01:22:07,716
on my head.

1079
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:13,140
Like this?

1080
01:22:42,406 --> 01:22:44,695
That did not go at all how I'd planned.

1081
01:22:44,808 --> 01:22:46,505
Whatever happens, don't let him on the second ship.

1082
01:22:46,643 --> 01:22:49,739
- What are you talking about? - Keep him on this planet.

1083
01:22:49,813 --> 01:22:51,889
Kay, where are you going?

1084
01:22:52,416 --> 01:22:54,325
I'm getting my gun back.

1085
01:22:57,087 --> 01:22:57,953
Hey, bug!

1086
01:22:58,155 --> 01:23:01,251
You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

1087
01:23:01,324 --> 01:23:03,993
You're nothing but a smear on the sports page to me...

1088
01:23:04,094 --> 01:23:07,119
you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite!

1089
01:23:07,497 --> 01:23:08,955
Eat me!

1090
01:23:09,266 --> 01:23:10,546
Eat me!

1091
01:23:28,785 --> 01:23:29,685
What's up?

1092
01:23:30,287 --> 01:23:33,656
You just going to eat and run, huh? What about dessert?

1093
01:23:39,463 --> 01:23:40,922
That's it?

1094
01:23:41,298 --> 01:23:43,587
Where you going? This party's just getting started.

1095
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:46,922
Where're you going?

1096
01:23:47,871 --> 01:23:49,603
Where you going?

1097
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:51,917
Listen.

1098
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:55,621
There's one way off this planet, baby, and that's through me.

1099
01:24:39,089 --> 01:24:40,583
Where're you going?

1100
01:24:41,358 --> 01:24:42,983
Why you runnin', huh?

1101
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,163
I'm still standing.

1102
01:24:45,695 --> 01:24:47,771
Come on. Bring it. Bring it.

1103
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:10,148
I'm sorry. Was that your auntie?

1104
01:25:12,255 --> 01:25:14,164
That must mean that's your uncle, huh?

1105
01:25:17,059 --> 01:25:18,412
You know you all look alike.

1106
01:25:26,736 --> 01:25:28,645
Well, well.

1107
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:32,446
Big bad bug got a bit of a soft spot, huh?

1108
01:25:35,979 --> 01:25:38,162
What I can't understand is why you...

1109
01:25:38,315 --> 01:25:42,799
got to come down here bringing all this ruckus.Snatching up galaxies and everything.

1110
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,226
My attitude is, don't start nothing, won't be nothing.

1111
01:25:54,331 --> 01:25:57,914
You need to ease up out my face before something bad happen to you.

1112
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:01,206
Too late.

1113
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:33,440
Call the Arquillians. Tell them we have the galaxy.

1114
01:26:33,536 --> 01:26:35,445
You got it, friend.

1115
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,258
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1116
01:26:39,376 --> 01:26:40,930
I like this gun.

1117
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:46,252
While you were in there playing around, I was here doing all the work.

1118
01:26:46,316 --> 01:26:49,412
First, I had to bean him in the head with this big rock.

1119
01:26:49,486 --> 01:26:51,254
Then I was going to hit him with a two-by-four.

1120
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,080
He kicked me. You know, it hurt.

1121
01:26:53,223 --> 01:26:55,821
Then I got the fire. I was ''yah'' with the fire.

1122
01:26:56,226 --> 01:26:58,658
Not bad for your second day of work, is it?

1123
01:26:59,529 --> 01:27:03,004
This definitely rates about a 9.0 on my weird-shit-o-meter.

1124
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:07,190
Should've been here for the Zeronion migration in . 968.

1125
01:27:09,639 --> 01:27:12,414
I guess you weren't even alive in '68.

1126
01:27:17,981 --> 01:27:20,484
Interesting job you guys have.

1127
01:27:36,732 --> 01:27:39,306
Look, I know we got rules and everything, but...

1128
01:27:39,402 --> 01:27:41,169
she did help us bust that bug.

1129
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:44,115
Maybe we don't have to flashy thing her.

1130
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:49,008
Come on. Who she gonna tell? She hang out with all dead people.

1131
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:50,847
It's not for her.

1132
01:27:51,014 --> 01:27:52,046
It's for me.

1133
01:27:54,017 --> 01:27:55,405
What?

1134
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,836
They're beautiful, aren't they?

1135
01:28:00,557 --> 01:28:01,423
Stars.

1136
01:28:02,025 --> 01:28:05,181
I never look at them anymore, but they actually are quite...

1137
01:28:07,864 --> 01:28:08,967
beautiful.

1138
01:28:14,604 --> 01:28:16,300
Kay, you're frightening your partner.

1139
01:28:16,439 --> 01:28:19,665
I haven't been training a partner. I've been training a replacement.

1140
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:22,342
Wait a minute, Kay.

1141
01:28:22,779 --> 01:28:25,175
I cannot do this job by myself.

1142
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:28,128
Hey, guys. My apartment isn't anywhere near here.

1143
01:28:28,218 --> 01:28:30,199
It's not even on the same island.

1144
01:28:31,554 --> 01:28:32,419
Days...

1145
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:34,169
months...

1146
01:28:34,391 --> 01:28:35,601
years.

1147
01:28:35,892 --> 01:28:37,624
Always face it forward.

1148
01:28:47,237 --> 01:28:49,633
I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach, kid.

1149
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:52,514
That's one of a hundred memories that I don't want.

1150
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:11,047
See you around,Jay.

1151
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:18,477
No...

1152
01:29:18,802 --> 01:29:19,668
you won't.

1153
01:29:22,839 --> 01:29:27,986


1154
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:30,507


1155
01:29:30,613 --> 01:29:33,116


1156
01:29:33,349 --> 01:29:35,567


1157
01:29:35,685 --> 01:29:37,938


1158
01:29:56,372 --> 01:29:59,326
Zed called. The Solaxiant 9 consulate

1159
01:29:59,408 --> 01:30:00,867
wants floor seats for the Knicks game.

1160
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,750
Put in a call for Dennis Rodman, he's from that planet.

1161
01:30:05,815 --> 01:30:07,547
Rodman? You're kidding.

1162
01:30:07,717 --> 01:30:08,855
Nope.

1163
01:30:09,385 --> 01:30:11,461
Not much of a disguise.
