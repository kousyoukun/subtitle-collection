根本没有第6区

45
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,906
- 这根本在胡扯 - 没错

46
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,375
看来你在不该在的地方\n从巴士上掉下来
Looks like you fell off the bus\nin the wrong part of town, amigo.

47
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,745

一切都在控制中。放轻松。

63
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,764
是远方友人送的礼物

红光能隔离…

66
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,042
从这开始…
Fellas, give me a splay burn around\nthe perimeter with holes...

67
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:03,143
…将方圆80公尺范围内不规则的烧焦, 谢谢

73
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,863
我只是你想像中的一个虚构人物

74
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,269
妈的, 真是好骗的品种
Damn, what a gullible breed.

75
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,976
说真的, 你们没被炸死真是侥幸
I'm serious, fellas. You're lucky\nto be alive after a blast like that.

76
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,876

我的心有余, 凯, 但是…
The spirit's willing, Kay, but...

84
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,347
其他的部分…
the rest of me--

85
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,118
它们真漂亮, 不是吗?
They're beautiful, aren't they?

86
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,352
什么？

我们不只是光看星星了
We never just look anymore.

不许动!

00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,526
他在来的路上

00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,033
你们的世界就快毁灭了
Your world's going to end.

113
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,367
你是什么东西?
What the hell are you?

114
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,309
当心会掉下去, 小心

下来, 眼睛会被医好的, 别担心

等一下, 让我跟你谈谈
Wait a minute.\nLet me talk to you!

117
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,328
我要罢工。为了生活我拼命工作
I go out. I work my butt off to make a living.

118
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,529
我只希望能回到一个整洁的家
All I want is to come home\nto a nice clean house...

119
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,596
有顿丰盛的晚餐…
with a nice fat steak\non the table...

120
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,308
…但我却得到这些。看起来像毒药
but instead I get this.\nLooks like poison.

121
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,472
别拿走!我正在吃呢，见鬼！
Don 't you take that away!\nI'm eating that, damn it!

122
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,876
这是毒药, 不是吗?
It is poison, isn 't it?

123
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,744
我发誓, 我一点都不会惊讶\n如果…
I swear to God,\nI wouldn 't be surprised if it was...

124
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,578
…你像一只被打太多或打的\n不够的狗一样的闪闪躲躲!
the way you skulk around\nlike a dog been hit too much.

125
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,177
我没办法决定
Or ain 't been hit enough!\nI can 't make up my mind.

126
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,189
你一点用都没有, 碧翠丝
You're useless, Beatrice.

127
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:15,091
在这唯一可以做点事的东西\n就是我的卡车
The only thing that pulls its weight\naround here is my goddamn truck!

128
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,861
早料到了
Figures.

129
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,509
什么鬼玩意儿，艾葛？
What the heck is it, Edgar?

130
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,947
你滚进屋里去!
Get your big butt\nback in the house.

131
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:57,060
请把发射武器放在地上
Place projectile weapon\non the ground.

132
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,967
要我丢下枪…
You can have my gun...

133
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,404
…除非我死了
when you pry it\nfrom my cold, dead fingers.

134
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,805
接受你的建议
Your proposal is acceptable.

135
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,949
艾葛, 到底是怎么回事?
Edgar, what on earth was that?

136
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,280
糖
Sugar.

137
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,954
我从没见过糖会弄成那样
I've never seen sugar do that.

138
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,126
把糖给我
Give me sugar.

139
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,363
放在水里
In water.

00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,966
再加
More.

141
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,704
再加
More.

142
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,388
你的皮快掉下来了
Your skin is hanging\noff your bones.

143
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,492
哦，耶
Oh, yeah.

144
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,168
这样好多了吗?
Is that better?

145
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,268
“那罪犯眨了两对眼睑”
"The perpetrator then blinked\ntwo sets of eyelids."

146
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,332
你指两眼一起眨?
You mean blinked with both eyes?

147
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,606
他先眨一对\n然后再眨另外一对完全不同的
No, sir. He blinked one set,\nthen a completely different set.

148
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,204
像远光灯和近光灯
You know, like high beams\nand low beams.

149
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,044
那是在你说的那个武器…
Was that before...

150
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,612
…蒸发成百万片…\n…之前或之后?
or after he drew the weapon that you\nclaim evaporated into a million pieces?

151
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,520
之后
After, sir.

152
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:37,126
为什么都没有别的警察\n看见这些事件?
Why is it that no other officers\nsaw either of these events?

153
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,188
有些警察的肚子太大
Some other officers are soggy\naround the midsection.

154
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,256
这是为什么他们赶不上的原因
I guess that's why\nthey couldn't keep up.

155
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,029
如果你是半个男人…
If you were half the man I am--

156
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,799
我根本没有你那么胖
What the hell?\nI am half the man that you are.

157
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,364
- 你有什么毛病? - 你挡住我了
- What is your problem?\n- You being all up in my damn face.

158
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,774
- 我想他把他从屋顶上丢下去\n- 也许你就是下一个
- I think he threw him off the roof.\n- Maybe you're next.

159
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,314
- 我要和你谈谈，现在 - 10分钟后算帐
- I want to talk to you. Now.\n- Ten minutes, take your best shot.

160
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,149
先运动10分钟, 胖子
Take ten minutes on a Stairmaster,\nyou pudgy bastard.

161
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,489
我相信你, 我是验尸员魏萝拉
I believe you.\nLaurel Weaver, Deputy Medical Examiner.

162
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,552
到陈尸间找我, 我有证据
Find me at the morgue on 26th.\nI'll show you.

163
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,654
等一下
Wait.

164
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,993
等一下!
Wait a minute!

165
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:19,267
你是检验无名尸的魏医生?
You're Dr. Weaver with the coroner's\noffice working on the John Doe?

166
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,770
- 是的\n- 请看这里, 好吗?
- Yes, that's right.\n- Will you look at this, please?

167
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,604
今晚真忙, 不是吗?
Some night, huh?

168
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,172
今晚真忙
Yeah, some night.

169
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,082
它们是腮, 不是眼睑
They were gills, not eyelids.

170
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,311
腮, 他都没气了
Gills.\nHe was out of breath.

171
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,388
你是谁?
Who are you?

172
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,289
他跟你说了什么吗?
Did he say anything to you?

173
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,453
他说世界末日到了
Yeah, the world was coming to an end.

174
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,191
他有说什么时候吗?
Did he say when?

175
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,803
再看到那武器你会认得吗?
Would you recognize his weapon\nif you saw it again?

176
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,363
当然
Absolutely.

177
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,707
走, 我们去兜风
Come on. Let's take a ride.

178
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,770
慢着, 我有一堆报告要写
Wait a minute.\nLook, I got tons of paperwork--

179
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,146
- 都写好了 - 干得好，爱德华兹
- Right. It's all done.\n- Good work, Edwards.

180
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,152
你真的是用跑的去追那痞子?\n不简单
You really ran this dude down on foot?\nThat's tough, kid.

181
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,881
非常不简单
That's double tough.

182
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,156
你到底是哪个单位的?
So who exactly are you with?

183
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,635
调查局? 国安局?
F.B.I.? N.S.A.?

184
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,033
我们负责监控
I'm part of a bureau that licenses, monitors and polices...

185
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,438
地球上的外星人
alien activity on the planet Earth.

186
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,839
随便啦
Whatever.

187
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,399
到了
We 're here.

188
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,977
- 这就是我们要去的地方? - 是的
- This is where we're going?\n- Yeah.

189
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,927
这是杰克的店
This is Jack Jeebs' spot.He buys from chain snatchers.

190
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:42,179
- 他卖赃物但是不卖枪 - 是吗?
- He doesn't even sell guns.\n- Really?

191
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,585
听好
All right, look.

192
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,856
我进去问他几个问题\n出来时我要你说实话
I'll slide in and put my thing down.\nBut when I come out I want answers.

193
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,656
进去问他几个问题
Go put your thing down.

194
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,257
艾德华警官…
Officer Eduardo.

195
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,430
这些怎么会在这里?\n我以为已经交给警方了
How did these get here? I thought\nI turned them in to the authorities.

196
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,942
听说你有比偷来的劳力士更抢手的
The way I hear it you're into\nsomething hotter than stolen Rolexes.

197
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,944
我贩卖毒品\n但我在这是因为我喜欢这
I'm a huge crack dealer now,\nbut I work here as I love the hours.

198
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,776
我指的是枪, 耍聪明!
I'm talking about guns, smart ass.

199
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:13,647
得了, 我只有这么些货了
- Weird ones.\n- Come on. What you see is what I got.

200
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,619
为什么不给他看看进口货
Why don't you\nshow him the imports,Jeebs?

201
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,865
- 凯, 你好吗? - 立刻给他看进口货
- Hiya, Kay. How are you?\n- Show him the imports right now.

202
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,954
我很久没卖进口货了
I got out of that business\na long time ago.

203
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,123
- 干嘛骗我?我讨厌这样 - 等一下
- Why do you lie to me? I hate it.\n- Just hold on a second.

204
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:32,699
- 我数到3 - 他会开枪的 - 1… - 这个人看起来不太稳定,知道吗?
- I'm gonna count to three.- He'll do it,Jeebs.\n- One...\n- That man does not look stable.

205

- Drop the weapon. Hands on your head!\n- I warned him.

207
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,580

- Drop it! Don't make me kill you.\n- You warned him.

208
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,016
粗鲁的讨厌鬼!
You insensitive prick!

209
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,147
你知道那样有多痛吗?
Do you have any idea\nhow much that stings?

210
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,921
拿出货来\n否则你会再少一个头
Show us the merchandise\nor you'll lose another head,Jeebs.

211
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,804
爱德华兹先生？
Mr. Edwards?

212
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,079
那把, 中间那把
Right there.\nThe one in the middle.

213
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,748
你把反射碳化能量转换枪…
You sold a reverberating carbonizer\nwith mutate capacity...

- 暗杀。对象是谁? - 不知道

217
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,589
- 可恶!\n- 我不知道!
- God damn it,Jeebs!\n- I don't know!

218
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,227
所有枪都没收
All that's confiscated.

219
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,292
你搭下班船离开这
I want you on the next transport off this rock...

220
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,702
不然我会杀了你
or I'll shoot you where it don't grow back.

221
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,770
我会再回来问你劳力士的事
And I 'm going to be back to talk\nabout them Rolexes.

222
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,570
在找问题的症结吗?
Searching for a handle\non the moment?

223
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,767
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

224
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,403
我能做的是…
The only comfort I can offer...

225
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,910
…保证明天你什么都忘了
is my promise that tomorrow morning\nyou won't remember a thing.

226
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,211
这种事哪能说忘就忘

…到处逃窜

275
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,851
中尉杰森, 西点军校优等生
Second Lieutenant Jake Jensen.\nWest Point. Graduate with honors.

276
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,891
我们来是因为你需要\n佼佼者中的精英!
We're here because you want\nthe best of the best of the best, sir!

277
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,967
有什么好笑的?爱德华兹
What's so funny, Edwards?

278
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,433
你的这个男孩, 美国上校
Your boy, Captain America, here.

279
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,532
“佼佼者中的精英的拔粹”
"The best of the best\nof the best, sir!"

280
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,473
“而且是优等的”
"With honors."

281
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,257
他兴奋异常，却还是不明白所为何来
He's just really excited,\nand he has no clue why we're here.

282
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,690
对我而言很好笑
That's very funny to me.

283
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,315
虽然你们都没笑
Y'all ain't laughing, though.

284
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,051
好了, 开始吧
Okay, let's get going.

285
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,945
你们要这桌子吗?
Want to get down on this?

286
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,605
爱德华兹，怎么回事?
Edwards, what the hell happened?

287
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,432
犹豫不决
Hesitated.

288
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:33,145
我可以问一下你为什么要杀小蒂芬妮?
May I ask why you felt\nlittle Tiffany deserved to die?

289
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,652
她最具威胁性
She was the only one that actually\nseemed dangerous at the time, sir.

290
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,210
何以见得?
How'd you decide that?

291
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,189
本来想第一个射挂在路灯上的人…
First, I was going to pop this guy\nhanging from the streetlight...

292
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,055
…但是他只是在运动
but I realized\nhe's just working out.

293
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:46,120
如果我在运动时\n被逮捕会是什么滋味?
How'd I feel if somebody bust me\nin my ass while I'm on the treadmill?

294
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,989
然后我看到\n这个软啪啪的怪物…
Then I saw\nthis snarling beast guy...

295
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:50,992
…因为看到他手里拿了卫生纸\n所以我知道…
and I noticed he had a tissue\nin his hand and realized...

296
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,699
…他在打喷嚏
he's not snarling, he's sneezing.

297
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,296
那不造成威胁
Ain't no real threat there.

298
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,863
然后我看到蒂芬妮
Then I saw Tiffany.

299
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,808
我在想, 一个8岁白人的女孩\n半夜在…
I'm thinking, eight-year-old white girl,\nmiddle of the ghetto...

300
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,913
…全是怪物的街上\n手上拿本量子学书…
bunch of monsters at night\nwith quantum physics books.

301
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,949
…她一定有些不好的企图
She about to start some shit, Zed.

302
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,814
这种书对她来说太深了
She's about eight. Those books are\nway too advanced for her.

303
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,286
对我而言, 她很可疑
If you ask me,\nshe's up to something.

304
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,324
老实说, 关于这点\n我觉得你不要这么针对我
Honestly, I'd appreciate it\nif you eased up off my back about it.

305
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,486
还是要我对她说对不起?
Or do I owe her an apology?

306
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,502
至少射的很准, 不是吗?
That was a good shot though, right?

307
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,070
他对当局会造成困扰
He's got a real problem\nwith authority.

308
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,512
我也是
So do I.

309
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,182
但他能徒步追捕塞波人, 老大
But this kid ran down a cephlapoid\non foot, boss.

310
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,243
那样是很强捍
That's got to be tough enough.

311
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,353
希望你的抉择是正确的
Let's hope you know\nwhat you're doing.

312
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,488
各位…
Gentlemen.

313
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:59,102
恭喜, 
Congratulations.\nYou're all we've come to expect...

314
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,161
多年训练有成
from years\nof government training.

315
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:05,471
各位跟我来, 最后一项\n是视力测验
If you'll just follow me,\nwe have one more test. An eye exam.

316
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,618
你去哪里?
Where are you going?

317
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,327
究竟怎么回事?
Hey, man, what the hell\nis all this?

318
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,387
在1950年左右\n政府成立了秘密机构…
In the mid-1 950s the government\nstarted an underfunded agency...

319
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,059
…简单而好笑的目的只是要
with the simple and laughable purpose\nof establishing contact...

320
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,966
与外星人取得联系
with a race not of this planet.

321
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,800
各位看这里
Look directly at the end\nof this device.

322
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,967
除了外星人之外\n人类都把这当成笑话…
Everyone thought the agency was a joke,\nexcept the aliens...

323
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,478
…但在1961年时\n外星人在纽约有首次的接触
who made contact March 2, 1961,\noutside New York.

324
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,537
第一天晚我们一行9人
There were nine of us\nthe first night.

325
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,708
七名特工, 一名天文家…
Seven agents, one astronomer...

326
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,150
…及一个迷路的男孩
and one dumb kid who got lost\non the wrong back road.

327
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,154
你还送花给高个儿
Oh, you brought\nthat tall man some flowers.

328
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,920
往这走
This way.

329
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,350
他们是群银河系的难民
They were a group\nof intergalactic refugees.

330
00:29:56,427 --> 00:30:00,329
想把地球当做无家可归者的政治庇护所
Wanted Earth for an apolitical zone\nfor creatures without a planet.

331
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,195
你看过"北非谍影"吗?
Did you ever see " Casablanca"?

332
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,201
是一样的, 只是没有纳粹党
Same thing, except no Nazis.

333
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,500
我们同意\n而且藏匿了他们降落的证据
We agreed and concealed\nall the evidence of their landing.

334
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,497
所以这些是真的飞碟
So these are real flying saucers...

335
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,770
世界博览会只是个掩饰
and the World's Fair\nwas a cover-up for their landing?

336
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,368
还有什么其它理由在皇后区?
Why else hold it in Queens?

337
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,278
每年到达的非人类越来越多而且\n隐藏在我们之中生活
More nonhumans arrive everyyear\nand live among us in secret.

338
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:20,515
我不是要改变话题
Look, I'm sorry.\nNot to change the subject...

339
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,576
你最后一次脑部扫描是什么时候?
but when was the last time\nyou had a CAT scan?

340
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,645
半年前\n是公司规定的
Six months ago.\nIt's company policy.

341
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,553
你该做另一个预约
Make another appointment.

342
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,752
告诉柴德我很高兴…
Tell your boy Zed\nI had an absolutely wonderful time...

343
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,956
…而且要谢谢你\n并请告诉我出口在哪?
and thankyou for everything\nbut show me the door.

344
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,398
我要喝咖啡, 你要吗?
All right. I'm going to get some coffee.\nYou want some coffee?

345
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,298
不, 不要了, 谢谢
No, thankyou, I'm fine.

346
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,401
你们好吗?
How you doing, fellas?

347
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,807
嗨, 凯
- Shit!\n- Okay.

348
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,878
那是不是没咖啡因的?\n是维尼斯肉桂味
- That's not decaf, is it?\n- Viennese cinnamon.

349
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:54,141
别告诉我只有粉末的奶精了\n我最不喜欢那种了
Don't tell me we only got powdered stuff\nfor cream. I hate that stuff.

350
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,315
好的, 好
Well, that's good.\nGood. Good.

351
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,818
你们相处的愉快吧?
You guys getting along all right?

352
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,054
工作别太辛苦
Don't work too hard.

353
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,188
你们看到了…?
So, you guys seen\nthe cahuengas on

354
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,257
你真的不要咖啡?
Sure you don't want coffee?

355
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,069
卡磺迦族, 那札婆塔族呢?
Cahuengas, yeah,\nbut how about the zapoata?

356
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,072
事情是这样的
All right, kid,\nhere's the deal.

357
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,475
地球上约有一千五百名外星人
At any given time there are\naround 1,500 aliens on the planet.

358
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,776
大部分居住在曼哈顿
Most of them\nright here in Manhattan.

359
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,817
大部分守规矩\n只想讨个生活
Most of them are decent enough.\nJust trying to make a living.

360
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,547
-计程车司机?\n-不是你所想像的那么多
- Cab drivers.\n- Not as many as you'd think.

361
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,184
大多数的人类一点概念都没有\n也不想知道
Humans, for the most part, don't have\na clue. Don't want or need one.

362
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:37,854
他们很高兴, 以为自己掌握一切
They're happy. They think\nthey have a good bead on things.

363
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,054
为何要保密呢?\n人们很聪明, 可以应付的
Why the big secret? People are smart.\nThey can handle it.

364
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,622
一个人是聪明
A person is smart.

365
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,761
众人是愚蠢\n易慌张和危险的动物
People are dumb, panicky,\ndangerous animals. You know it.

366
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,600
1500年前, 每个人都知道…
Fifteen hundred years ago,\neverybody knew...

367
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,300
…地球是宇宙的中心
the Earth was the center\nof the universe.

368
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,835
五百年前\n每个人都知道地球是平的
Five hundred years ago,\neverybody knew the Earth was flat.

369
00:31:55,914 --> 00:32:00,248
十五分钟前\n你知道人在地球上是孤独的
And fifteen minutes ago, you knew\nthat people were alone on this planet.

370
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,911
想想明天…
Imagine what you'll know...

371
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,553
你会发现什么
tomorrow.

372
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,193
- 有什么后遗症? - 后遗症？
- What's the catch?\n- The catch.

373
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,290
后遗症就是你会断离和人类的接触
The catch is you will sever\nevery human contact.

374
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,561
没人知道你的存在
Nobody will ever know\nyou exist anywhere.

375
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,559
没有
Ever.

376
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,072
我让你考虑到日出
I 'll give you to sunrise\nto think it over.

377
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,009
值得吗?
Is it worth it?

378
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,744
若你够坚强…
Yeah, it's worth it...

379
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,648
是值得的
if you're strong enough.

380
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,138
你好吗?
What's up, pops?

381
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,917
我要加入…
All right, I'm in...

382
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,431
…因为这儿有更深层的事\n会发生
because there's some next-level shit\ngoing on here, and I'm with that.

383
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,832
但首先我要你明白某些事情
But before y'all beam me up,\nthere's a few things to understand.

384
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,893
首先, 是你选我…
First off, you chose me...

385
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,871
…你知道我的技巧
so you recognize the skills.

386
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:05,773
我不想人叫我为小子\n明白吗?
I don't want nobody calling me "son"\nor " kid" or "sport." Cool?

387
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,333
随便, 油嘴
Whateveryou say, slick.

388
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,279
但我要告诉你关于你的技能
But I need to tell you something\nabout all your skills.

389
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:12,750
现在
As of right now...

390
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,349
它的意义是…
they mean precisely...

391
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,910
…毫无用处的
dick.

392
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,596
- 此行的目的? - 外交任务
- Purpose of trip?\n- Diplomatic mission.

393
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,268
- 停留时间? - 吃午餐
- Duration of stay?\n- Lunch.

394
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,631
有水果或蔬菜吗?
Any fruits or vegetables?

395
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,312
你要远离那家伙
You want to stay away\nfrom that guy.

396
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,985
它脾气很坏
He's grouchy.

397
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:58,153
在旅行了17兆哩后又在海关延迟三小时
Three-hour delay in customs\nafter a 1 7 trillion mile trip...

398
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,220
都会让人脾气暴躁。对吧？
gonna make anybody cranky.\nRight?

399
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,289
我们向政府哪部门报告?
What branch of the government\ndo we report to?

400
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,199
-没有, 他们有太多问题\n-谁负担这些呢?
- None, they ask too many questions.\n- So who pays for all this?

401
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,205
我们充公的几项仪器有专利
We hold patents on a few gadgets\nwe confiscated from the visitors.

402
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,242
魔鬼胶, 微波炉, 抽脂手术
Velcro, microwave ovens, liposuction.

403
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,301
这装置很有趣
This is a fascinating little gadget.

404
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,209
很快取代镭射唱片

408
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,184
人的思想很原始…
Human thought is so primitive\nit's looked upon...

409
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,282
…在别的星河\n认为是会传染的疾病

410
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,350

荧幕上的全是外星人
Everyone on those screens is an alien.

429

在公众场合他们很正常\n但在私底下…
I n public, they're normal as you are,\nbut in private, well...

430
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,652
你知道了
You'll get the idea.

431
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,220
老天
Oh, man.

432
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,290
不合理, 是吗?
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

433
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,165
不, 合情合理

00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,221
…你没有任何的身份记号
you'll have no identifying marks\nof any kind.

450
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,287
你决不能突出
You'll not stand out\nin any way.

451
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:52,532
你整体的形象是被朔造成…\n…不能留给所遇上的人任何印象
Your entire image is crafted to leave...\nno lasting memory\nwith anyone you encounter.

452

You are a rumor...\nrecognizable only as déjà vu\nand dismissed just as quickly.

你不存在, 甚至没有出生过
You don 't exist.\nYou were never even born.

Anonymity is your name.\nSilence, your native tongue.

You're no longer part of the system.\nYou're above the system.\nOver it. Beyond it.

456
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,658
我们是他们
We're "them. " We 're "they. "

457
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,122
我们是黑超特警组

00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,237
我和你有什么分别就是…

We're going to meet\nwith Daddy's friend who you'll like.

465
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,764
让我们看看
Let's see.

466
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,526
毕…

…今晚在波兰外降落
touching down in the forest\noutside Portland tonight.

469
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,005
类似人类的?\n你想的美, 把海绵带着

470
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,271
这是昨晚留下的红色警告

纽约上州有未经批准的降落
We had an unauthorized landing\nsomewhere in upstate New York.

472
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,176
凯, 留意此事发展
Kay, keep your ears open\non this one.

473
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,778
我们不是主持星际派对
We're not hosting\nan intergalactic kegger down here.

474
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,184
有人逃走了
Well, we got a skimmer.

475
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,522
移民来的外星人越区, 是谁?

476
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,754
雷革

477
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,659
他不能离开曼哈顿…
He's not cleared\nto leave Manhattan...

478
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,393
…但他现时离城\n被堵在公路上
but he's way out of town now,\nstuck on the New Jersey Turnpike.

479
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,298
你为什么不带小子去?
Why don't you take junior with you?

480
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,236
这对他来说是热身的好机会
This is a good one\nfor him to warm up on.

481
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,899
去对付他们

482
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:19,315
非法过境\n“我们不是主持星际派对”
"We're not hosting\nan intergalactic kegger."

483
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,308
柴德…

484
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,614
他只是…
He just...

485

全宇宙有无限的科技\n而我们却利用这烂车…

486
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,393

你的人际关系还要加强

- Fasten your seat belt, please.\n- Good. Did you hurt yourself?

491
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,971
你千万别碰那红色按钮, 小子
Oh, the red button there.\nDon't ever, ever touch it.

492
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,692

All right, pop,\nthat'll be $72 there.

493
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,321
好吧, 宝贝\n让我付钱给无礼的司机
Okay, sweetie,\nlet me pay the impolite driver.

494
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,595
抱歉我迟到了\n这星球的司机很糟糕

495
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,268
陛下\n你很危险

496
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,461
对啊, 而且每次都多收车费

497
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:52,574
有个虫降落了\n我们要把你从这星球送走

498
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,040
有个昆虫?他一定知道我什么会在这里

499
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,746
我们想他是知道的

500
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,079
那是我所想的吗?

501
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,844
不, 这是给你孩子的钻石

502
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,281
有空吃点东西吗?

503
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,458
当然, 我替你点了菜

504

506
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:31,005
为亚基伦帝国\n继续统治干杯

507
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,183
为银河安全干杯

508
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,593
你可以杀我们, 但你找不到银河
You can kill us both,\nbut you will not find the galaxy.

509
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,793
你说对一件事
You're right about one thing.

510

你哪里也不能去

511
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,577
出了什么问题？

You're restricted to Manhattan.\nWhere are you going, Redgie?

00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,701
- 他知道他在做什么吗?\n- 当然
- He knows what he's doing?\n- He does it all the time.

522
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,261
让他做吧
Let the man work.

523
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:14,627
哎哟, 老天!所以…
Damn, man! So--\nSomething's peaking!

524
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:16,242
有东西在偷看!
Croagg the midwife is\nat 54th and Madison.

525
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,618
你往城外去
You're headed out of town.\nWhat's going on?

526
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,850

我今天没有看到有核准离境的资料
I saw no departure clearance\nfor today.

529
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,828

530
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:34,193

- You're doing fine, ace.\nWhat kind of emergency?\nWhat's the rush to get off the planet?

531
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,432
我们只是不喜欢我们的那一区了
We just don't like\nthe neighborhood anymore.

532
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,668
有些是新来的人…
Some of the new arrivals.

533
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,973
新来的?和昨晚坠毁的有关吗?
New arrivals? Have anything to do\nwith the crash last night?

534
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,707

00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,156
噢, 天啊
Oh, man.

539
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,755
恭喜, 雷革\n它是个…
Congratulations, Redge.\nIt's a...

540
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,154
…乌贼
squid.

541
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,391
他其实是…

00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,577
…可爱
cute.

544
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,849
那个是否有什么不对的地方?
Anything about that\nseem unusual to you?

545
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,726
是什么把他吓成这样……要带着新生儿去冒险?
What would scare Redgick so badly\nhe'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?

546
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,062
我们追查资料吧
We'll check the hot sheets.

547
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,597
教宗是个父亲\n令人震惊的证据在内

548
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,195
这就是资料?
These are the hot sheets?

549
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,264
地球上最佳的调查报告
Best investigative reporting\non the planet.

550
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,869
你可以去看纽约时报\n他们有时候走运
Read the " New York Times" ifyou want.\nThey get lucky sometimes.

551
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,279
想不到你在超市卖的八卦报导上找线索
I cannot believe you're looking\nfor tips in the supermarket tabloids.

552
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,645
不是在找
Not looking for.

553
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,378
'外星人偷走\n我丈夫的皮囊'
Found.

554
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,259
慢着, 别急
Wait, slow down.

555
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,601
为什么?
Why?

556
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,401
给她点时间让她想歪了
Give her time to get the wrong\nimpression. Makes things smoother.

557
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,399
有何贵干?
Can I help you, gentlemen?

558
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,913
我是联邦调查局的文特警\n他是毕特警
Yes, ma'am. I'm Agent Manheim,\nthis is Agent Black, with the F.B.I.

559
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,972
想问有关访客的事
We'd like to talk about yourvisitor.

560
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,710
你们也要拿我开玩笑?
You here to make fun of me too?

561
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,812
调查局的人没有幽默感, 我们可以进来吗?
We at the F.B.I. do not have a sense\nof humor we're aware of. May we come in?

562
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,521
可以
Sure.

563
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,282
- 谢谢\n- 要柠檬汁吗?
- Thankyou.\n- Lemonade?

564
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,850
噢, 好的, 请进
Oh, yes, please.

565
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,865
警察局长亲自来这…
The chiefofpolice himselfcome\nup to the house...

566
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,028
…做了一个全面的调查
and did a full-out\nprofessional investigation.

567
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,039
拿走警方报告\n还写下我说的一切…
Took a police report\nand writ down everything I said...

568
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,769
…但不相信我说的\n任何一句话
from A to Z,\nnot believing one thing I said.

569
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,811
而且还有点在取笑我
Sort of poking fun at me.

570
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,073
他们问我, 若他被谋杀…
Then they asked,\n" If he was murdered...

571
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,707
怎么能在屋子走动?
how was he able to walk\nback in the house?"

572
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,043
我得承认这令我震惊
I gotta admit to you\nthat one got me sorta stumped.

573
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,782
我知道艾葛, 那人不是艾葛
But I know Edgar\nand that wasn't Edgar.

574
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,360
就像有东西在穿艾葛的身体
It was like\nsomething was wearing Edgar.

575
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,457
像是外衣…
Like a suit.

576
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,222
一件艾葛外衣
An Edgar suit.

577
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,801
那人变外星人前很丑
Dude was that ugly\nbefore he was an alien.

578
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,645
对不起
I'm sorry.

579
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,045
继续
Go on.

580
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,210
不管怎样…
Anyway...

581
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,478
我醒来他已离开
I come to and he's gone.

582
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,678
- 他说了什么吗? - 有
- Did he say anything?\n- Yes.

583
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,587
他向我要水喝
He asked me for some water.

584
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,123
糖水
Some sugar water.

585
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,858
- 糖水? - 我记得, 因为很怪异…
- Sugar water?\n- Yeah, I remember that right.\n'Cause I thought that was odd.

586
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,564
…他要糖水而不是…
That he asked me for sugar water\nand not lemonade or ice water or...

587
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,002
…水或是…
regular water or...

588
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,562
…自来水
tap water.

589
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,234
好, 贝翠丝, 没有外星人
All right, Beatrice.\nThere was no alien.

590
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,972
那道闪光不是飞碟
The flash of light you saw\nin the sky was not a U.F.O.

591
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,640
是上升瓦斯气团
Swamp gas from a weather balloon\nwas trapped in a thermal pocket...

592
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,581
被金星反射
and refracted the light from Venus.

593
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:12,882
等一下\n你洗掉她记忆再编个新的?
Wait a minute.\nYou flash that thing...\nit erases her memory\nand you just make up a new one?

594
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,617
这是记忆清除器
A standard-issue neuralizer.

595
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:17,421
你编那么烂的故事?
That weak-ass story is\nthe best you can come up with?

596
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,825
好
All right.

597
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:24,529
附加说明…\n…艾葛跟他前任女友跑了\n你搬去跟妈住一阵就好了
On a more personal note,\nEdgar ran offwith an old girlfriend.\nYou'll go stay with your mom\na couple nights.

598
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,692
你觉得这样会更好
You'll get over it\nand decide you're better off.

599
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,262
反正他对你那么坏
Yeah, because he never\nappreciated you anyway.

600
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,069
事实上, 告诉你
I n fact, you know what?

601
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:35,543
是你甩了他, 他走了…
You kicked him out.\nAnd now that he's gone...

602
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,979
…你可以买漂亮衣服
you'll go into town,\nfind yourself some nice dresses.

603
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:43,213
买双鞋, 也许去做做脸
Get yourself some shoes.\nFind somewhere you could get a facial.

604
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,618
而且…
And...

605
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:48,021
…快找人来重新装璜, 糟透了
hire a decorator\nto come here quick because, damn!

606
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,996
我何时才能…
Yo, Kay, check it out.\nWhen do I get my own flashy...

607
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,899
…有记忆清除器?
memory messer-upper thing?

608
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,801
等你长大之后
When you grow up.

609
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:05,905
拜托不要是绿色
Please, not green.

610
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,400
可恶!
Damn.\nDamn.

611
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,999
你知道是哪种\n外星人流绿汁…
I don't suppose you know\nwhat kind of alien life-form...

612
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:14,649
…喝糖水的?
leaves a green spectral trail\nand craves sugar water?

613
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,250
那是昨晚机智问答的题目
Wait. That was\non " Final Jeopardy" last night.

614
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,655
答案是…\n柴德, 虫族入侵
- Damn, Alex said it was--\n- Zed, we have a bug.

615
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,285
表示…
So.

616
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,021
我们不喜欢虫族?
What?\nWe don't like bugs?

617
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,029
虫族制造大屠杀
Bugs thrive on carnage, tiger.

618
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:31,987
它们消耗, 骚扰…毁灭其他的种族
They consume, infest, destroy, live off\nthe destruction of other species.

619
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,543
你小时候被虫咬过?
- You were stung as a child, right?\n- Listen, kid.

620
00:49:35,284 --> 00:49:38,738
想像一个超大蟑螂\n它力大无穷…
I magine a giant cockroach\nwith unlimited strength...

621
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,540
…劣等生物本性, 易怒…
a massive inferiority complex,\nand a real short temper...

622
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,979
…穿艾葛的皮横行曼哈顿
is tear-assing around Manhattan Island\nin a brand-new Edgar suit.

623
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,273
听起来有趣吗?
Sound like fun?

624
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,947
该怎么做?
What's the move?

625
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,255
只要虫族在城里\n我们就要去陈尸间监视
With the bug in town,\nwe'll watch the morgues.

626
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,765
3号尸体要放哪里?
Where do you want\ncontestant number three?

627
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,501
放在那就行了
Just leave it there.

628
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,236
那只猫怎么回事?
What's with the cat?

629
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,143
这只猫有个麻烦, 在这签名
There's a problem with the cat.\nSign here.

630
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,647
- 什么麻烦?\n- 那是你的问题
- What's the problem with the cat?\n- It's your problem.

631
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:24,774
我讨厌活的东西
I hate the living.

632
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,113
开始吧!
Shall we?

633
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,619
噢, 我的老天!
Oh, my God!

634
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,718
朋友, 你是什么?
Buddy, what are you?

635
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:17,437
解剖时尸温约112度…
Subject was approximately 112 degrees\nat time of autopsy...

636
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,907
…表示体温上升了
indicating an increase\nin body temperature.

637
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,967
检验员想由直肠量体温
Examiner tried\nto verify this rectally...

638
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,275
却找不到直肠
only to find the subject was\nwithout rectum.

639
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,043
这情况真--\n怪异
- Which is, needless to say, really--\n- Weird.

640
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,979
我们是卫生局的里欧医生
I'm Dr. Leo Manville,\nDepartment of Public Health.

641
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,987
这是怀特医生
This is Dr. White.

642
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,217
你一定没有家庭生活
You boys must not have\nmuch of a home life.

643
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,625
我们最近在监视这陈尸间\n近来有何异常状况?
We watch the morgues very carefully.\nSeen something unusual?

644
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:41,163
有, 有3人被杀
I'd say so.\nTriple homicide.

645
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,988
第一个还算正常\n除了被劈成两半之外
The first body was pretty normal,\nexcept he was broken in half.

646
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:48,897
但当我解剖了另两个尸体…\n我带你去看
But when I opened up\nthe other two, well-- Let me show you.

647
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,813
他的骨骼架构有异于常人
There's a skeletal structure\nunlike any I 've ever seen before.

648
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,372
我查看这个
I 'll look at it.

649
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,941
你们去查看另一个尸体
Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver\ncheck out the other body?

650
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,509
往这边走，医生
This way, Doctor.

651
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,886
这个更怪
This one's even stranger.

652
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,218
我做腹部解剖
I did a full laparotomy.

653
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:14,720
我由胃开始\n我们可以由食道开始\n或看你想从哪里开始
I began with the stomach. We can start\nwith the gastroesophageal junction.\nWhicheveryou prefer.

654
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,199
就照你的方法
Let's start\nwhereveryou started at.

655
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:20,099
没问题
Okeydokey.

656
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,406
- 这是你的猫?\n- 现在是了
- Your cat?\n- Guess it is now.

657
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,971
跟着尸体来的\n伸进去
It came in with the body.\nDive right in.

658
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,880
他不会在意的
I 'm sure he won't mind.

659
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,412
你的眼睛很美
You have really pretty eyes.

660
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,422
谢谢
Thank you.

661
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,093
感觉到了吗?
Feel that?

662
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,497
摸到幽门了?移开它
Where the pyloric junction would be?\nPush it aside.

663
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,900
什么不对劲?胃、 肝、 肺…
Notice anything strange?\nStomach, liver, lungs?

664
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,130
没有, 都很好
No, all fine.

665
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,867
器官都不见了
Doctor, they're all missing.

666
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:02,811
当然\n我一开始就察觉了
Well, of course.\nThat's obviously the first thing\nI noticed.

667
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:06,576
我的意思是说\n里面没有…
What I was pointing out is the fact\nthat there are no...

668
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,807
…一样器官…
pieces...

669
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,546
…还存在
of them left.

670
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,816
你知道, 那些器官都…
You know, so they're intact.

671
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,483
不在体内…是肯定的
Wherever they are. Whole, somewhere.\nThat we can be sure of.

672
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,051
我们见过吗?
Have we met before?

673
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,024
我有个似曾相识的感觉
I 'm having the strangest feeling\nof déjà vu.

674
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,730
- 我也是\n- 真的?
- Yeah, me too.\n- Really?

675
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,401
想知道我在想什么吗?\n但别告诉他
Okay, you want to know\nwhat I really think?

676
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,065
他太紧张了
But don't tell him,\nhe's under enough stress.

677
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,132
我认为那不是尸体
I don't think it's a real body.

678
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,373
我认为这是种运输工具\n或是类似的
I think it's some kind of transport unit\nfor something else altogether.

679
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,277
问题是, 什么?
The question is, what?

680
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:41,140
这是不是把你吓坏了?

681
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,643
不
No, girl.

682
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,555
你知道有时候我想做什么?
You know what I like to do sometimes\nwhen it's late?

683
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,021
不知道
No.

684
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,128
怀特医生
Dr. White.

685
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,424
失陪一下
Excuse me.

686
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,162
怎么样?
What do you think?

687
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:08,200
很有趣, 她很喜欢死人
Very interesting. She got a real\nQueen-of-the-Undead thing going--

688
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,439

689
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,344
我指尸体

你最好去看看
Man, you have to look\nat that thing.

691

认得他吗?
You recognize him?

692
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:21,090
像在总部见过他, 只是更死像
Yeah, he looks like the big guy I saw\ndown at headquarters, only deader.

693
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,148
是什么杀了他?
What do you think killed him?

694
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,751
- 虫族? - 怀特医生

星带? 猎户座星带?
Belt?\nOrion's belt?

00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,553
“避免战争银河系\n在猎户座星带上”
"To prevent war\nthe galaxy is on Orion's belt."

717
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,720

罗塞柏!可恶!

安卡利人不会喜欢这个\n他是皇族的成员之一
The Arquillians will not like this.\nHe was one of the royal family.

723
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:23,906
这是外星人…
I knew it.\nThis is an alien.

He said, "To prevent war,\nthe galaxy is on Orion's belt."

726
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,454

This makes total sense.\nHow else do you explain New York?

727
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,014

The other day I was\nin this cab and this guy--

银河系在猎户座星带上\n听起来没道理
"Galaxy on Orion's belt"\ndoesn't make sense.

729
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,792

735
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,570
那个会害她得脑癌或什么的
That thing is gonna give her\nbrain cancer or something.

736
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,843
她以前没被伤害过,我们得把这里所有的门都关上
Never hurt her before.\nWe have to close all the doors here.

743
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,872
以后清除记忆的事交给我
I think I should be in charge\nof the flashy thing department.

744
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,571
有我在休想
Not while I'm around, ace.

745
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,137
你会烧坏别人的脑袋
You won't be happy till you fricassee\nsomeone's brain out.

746
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,445

01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,749
我们没时间讨论这个!
We ain't got time\nfor this cover-up bullshit!

807
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,479
外星人的战舰就要--
Have you forgotten?\nThere's an alien battle cruiser--

别担心那只虫

…到麦道格街
on MacDougal Street\nsouth ofHouston.

816
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:55,187
封锁是个好主意了\n但外星人还在继续离开
Containment may be a moot point, friend.\nThe exodus continues.

817

就像是舞会结束了\n最后走的要付帐
It's like the party's over and the last\none to leave gets stuck with the check.

不知道\n在市立陈尸间吗?
I don't know.\nThe city morgue?

829
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:51,836
那3张1块钱, 先生
That's three for a dollar, sir!

830
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,974
因为金星的光反射在…

831
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,882
…沼泽气上…
into some swamp gas...

832
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,784
…所以会…
and that's what made the--

833
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,185
好了, 小子!

The Arquillians want the galaxy,\nwhatever the hell that means.

开始吧!\n叫捕狗队来!
- Get your paws off me!\n- Call the pound! We got a stray.

He was the guardian of a whole galaxy.\nThey thought he'd be safe on Earth.

什么意思?

我在说这是我的习惯
I'm saying\nthat's the way I get down.

色鬼, 你没搞懂
Look, stud,\nyou're really not getting this.

- How was I to know?\n- Should I have sung it for you?

927

你像在勾引我--

那你的船呢?
How far can you go with no ship?

935
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,410
你没太空船, 已经被没收了
If that's what you call that space trash\nwe got locked in the office.

交出银河系\n否则摧毁地球, 对不起

别让虫族得手\n安卡利人会毁了它
Kid, to keep the bugs from getting it,\nthe Arquillians will destroy the galaxy.

你根本就不懂!
You don't get it!

1008
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:41,861
结束了
It's over.

1009
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,693

You're under arrest for violating\nsections of the Tycho Treaty.

1013

So hand over whatever galaxy\nyou are carrying and step away...

1014
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,977
…然后把手放到头上
from your busted-ass vehicle\nand put your hands on your head.

1015
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,911
我把手…

1016
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:08,550
…放到头上
on my head.

这不在我的计划中
That did not go at all\nhow I'd planned.

吃完就想逃?不吃点心了?
You just going to eat and run, huh?\nWhat about dessert?

1031
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,671
就这样?
That's it?

1032
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,908
现在好戏才刚要上场!

只有一个方法离开这星球\n就是必须经过我这关
There's one way off this planet, baby,\nand that's through me.

1037
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:41,365
你去哪里?
Where're you going?

1038
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,404
你以为你赢了?
Why you runnin', huh?

1039

我还站着的
I'm still standing.

1040

快, 带来, 带来

抱歉\n那是你的姑妈吗?
I'm sorry.\nWas that your auntie?

1042
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,975
这表示这是你舅舅
That must mean\nthat's your uncle, huh?

1043

噍噍

…你为什么要带人来这
got to come down here\nbringing all this ruckus.

1048
01:25:42,003 --> 01:25:44,528
制造混乱夺取银河系?
Snatching up galaxies and everything.

1049
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:49,703
我的态度是不找麻烦就没麻烦
My attitude is, don't start nothing,\nwon't be nothing.

1050
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:58,682
快从我的面前消失\n免得麻烦上身
You need to ease up out my face\nbefore something bad happen to you.

1051
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,086
太迟了
Too late.

1052
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,347
告诉安卡利人\n我们拿到银河系了
Call the Arquillians.\nTell them we have the galaxy.

1053

1054
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,816
要把枪拿回来, 是吗?
Going to get your gun back, huh?

1055
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,789
我喜欢这把枪
I like this gun.

1056
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:47,032
你在里面鬼混\n害的我一个人在忙
While you were in there playing around,\nI was here doing all the work.

1057
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:50,002
我先用石头打他的头
First, I had to bean him in the head\nwith this big rock.

1058
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:52,062
本来想用木板打他
Then I was going to hit him\nwith a two-by-four.

1059
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:53,801
它踢我, 好痛
He kicked me.\nYou know, it hurt.

1060
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,269
我拿起火来吓他
Then I got the fire.\nI was "yah" with the fire.

1061
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,506
工作第二天表现不错
Not bad foryour second day\nofwork, is it?

1062
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:03,751
这是我遇过最怪异的情况
This definitely rates about a 9.0\non my weird-shit-o-meter.

1063
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:07,811
你该看看在1968年\n麦格逊人迁移时
Should've been here\nfor the Zeronion migration in 1968.

1064
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:12,482
你还没出生吧!
I guess you weren't\neven alive in '68.

1065
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:21,428
很有趣的工作!
Interesting job you guys have.

1066
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,315
我知道有规矩…
Look, I know we got rules\nand everything, but...

1067
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:44,791
…但她帮我们杀了那只虫\n也许别清除她的记忆
