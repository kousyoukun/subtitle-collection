1405
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:55,840
爸爸？
Papa?

1406
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:05,320
我两个儿子都死了
Both my sons are dead.

1407
01:49:08,590 --> 01:49:10,860
生命中只有两种悲剧
There are only two tragedies in life.

1408
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:15,030
得不到你要的，跟得到你要的
One is not getting what you want. The other is getting it.

1409
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:16,100
这是你卖的吗？
ls this one of yours?

1410
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:19,170
瓦伦亭终于一偿夙愿
Jack Valentine finally had what he wanted.

1411
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:23,640
死亡证明说他死于心脏衰竭
Curiously, the death certificate says he died of heart failure.

1412
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:26,970
你是说我假造死亡证明？
Falsifying a death certificate?

1413
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:28,540
那也扳不倒我
That's not gonna hold me.

1414
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:32,980
没错，你又对了
You're right. As usual, you are right.

1415
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:37,080
有看今天的报纸吗？
Have you seen today's paper? Huh?

1416
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,520
致命武器交付监管
Fake end-user certificates.

1417
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:49,260
伪造使用者证明、虚设行号
Cut-out companies, meticulously catalogued.

1418
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,700
世界各地军阀、独裁者…
There is hardly a warlord, dictator, despot anywhere in the world

1419
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:56,300
暴君，无不跟你称兄道弟
that you're a first-name basis with.

1420
01:49:56,810 --> 01:50:01,750
你视为战利品的太太泄底的
It was your wife your trophy wife that led us to the prize.

1421
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:05,780
不是她的错，她比较好跟踪
It's not her fault. She's just easier to follow than you are.

1422
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:08,680
我可以看吗？
May l?

1423
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,520
请便
Yeah, go ahead.

1424
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:36,780
慢慢享用
Enjoy it.

1425
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:39,380
- 什么  - 这个
- What?  - This.

1426
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:42,240
我是你所有厌恶事物的化身
Tell me I'm everything you despise.

1427
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,660
邪恶的代言人
That I'm the personification of evil.

1428
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:46,530
我应该为社会组织和…
What?

1429
01:50:46,530 --> 01:50:51,190
世界秩序崩溃负责
responsible for the breakdown of the fabric of society and world order.

1430
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:53,590
我是种族灭绝的幕后推手
I'm a one-man genocide.

1431
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:55,970
想说什么现在都说出来
Say everything you want to say to me now.

1432
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,390
因为你的时间不多
Because you don't have long.

1433
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:03,840
你是清醒的，还是在妄想？
Are you paying attention? or are you delusional?

1434
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:07,400
你破坏所有武器禁运条约
You have broken every arms embargo written.

1435
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:08,980
你的罪证…
There is enough here to

1436
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:11,770
足以判下好几个无期徒刑
put you away for consecutive life sentences.

1437
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:13,790
在正式入狱服刑前…
You are going to spend the next ten years of your life

1438
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:18,780
光跑法院就得耗上十年
going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start serving your time.

1439
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:25,720
我想你还不了解你的处境
I don't think you fully appreciate the seriousness... ...of your situation.

1440
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:38,300
我的家人不要我
My family has disowned me.

1441
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:42,910
我太太和儿子抛弃我
My wife and son have left me.

1442
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:47,480
我弟弟死了
My brother's dead.

1443
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:49,960
相信我，我完全了解…
Trust me.

1444
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:53,550
我的处境有多危险
I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.

1445
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,190
但我向你保证…
But I promise you,

1446
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:58,560
我不会花一秒钟在法庭
I won't spend a single second in a courtroom.

1447
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,260
你在妄想
You are delusional.

1448
01:52:02,030 --> 01:52:03,690
我也不喜欢你，杰克
I like you, Jack.

1449
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:08,130
或许喜欢，但我了解你
Well, maybe not, but I understand you.

1450
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:13,700
我跟你说会发生什么事
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1451
01:52:14,910 --> 01:52:17,710
让你好及早做准备
This way, you can prepare yourself.

1452
01:52:21,890 --> 01:52:22,820
好吧
Okay.

1453
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:26,520
很快会有人来敲门叫你出去
Soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you will be called outside.

1454
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:29,060
大厅有个比你高阶的人
ln the hall there will be a man who outranks you.

1455
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:32,290
首先他会恭维你立了大功…
First, he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done

1456
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:34,660
世界因为你变得更安全
that you're making the world a safer place

1457
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:38,560
你将获得表扬与升迁
that you're to receive a commendation and a promotion.

1458
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:42,070
接着他说我会被释放
And then he'll tell you that I am to be released.

1459
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:43,710
你抗议
You're gonna protest.

1460
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:47,210
可能还威胁要辞职
You'll probably threaten to resign.

1461
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:50,340
但最后我还是会被释放
But in the end, I will be released.

1462
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,180
我被释放的理由跟你认为…
The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think...

1463
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:54,910
我会被定罪的理由一样
I'll be convicted.

1464
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:57,350
我的确跟一些…
I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile,

1465
01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:01,490
邪恶残暴的当代领袖称兄道弟
sadistic men calling themselves leaders today.

1466
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:09,060
但其中有些人是我们敌人的敌人
But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.

1467
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:14,070
当你的老板是世界最大军火商
And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss...

1468
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:16,300
美国总统
...the President of the United States,

1469
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:20,610
他一天运输的比我一年还多
Who ships more merchandise in a day I do in a year...

1470
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:25,340
有时候在枪上留指纹很难堪
sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns.

1471
01:53:25,850 --> 01:53:28,750
有时候他需要我这种跑单帮的
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

1472
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:30,090
送一些他不方便出面的货
to supply forces

1473
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:38,360
所以，尽管说我邪恶
he can't be seen supplying. So... you call me evil,

1474
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:43,060
但不幸，我是必要之恶
but unfortunately for you, I'm a necessary evil.

1475
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,220
我想叫你下地狱…
I would tell you to go to hell.

1476
01:54:02,850 --> 01:54:04,820
但你已经在地狱里了
but I think you're already there.

1477
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:41,490
很高兴跟你交易
Pleasure doing business with you.

1478
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:44,290
多数人能出狱都很高兴
Most people are happy just to get out of jail.

1479
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:48,230
我等人付钱请我出去，我不笨
I expect to be paid to leave. I'm not a fool.

1480
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:50,020
今天他们需要我…
I know that just because they needed me that day

1481
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:53,240
说不定下次我就变成代罪羔羊
didn't mean they wouldn't make me a scapegoat the next.

1482
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:57,240
但我又回来重操旧业了
But I was back, doing what I do best.

1483
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:59,100
送雨伞去萨哈拉沙漠？
Umbrellas to the Sahara?

1484
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:00,680
阳伞
Sun umbrellas.

1485
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,960
你知道谁将坐拥地球？
You know who's going to inherit the Earth?

1486
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:23,730
军火商
Arms dealers.

1487
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:26,900
因为其他人都在战争中丧生
Because everyone else is too busy killing each other.

1488
01:55:27,510 --> 01:55:29,440
让我告诉你活命的秘诀
That's the secret to survival.

1489
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,500
千万别跟战争有所瓜葛
Never go to war.

1490
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:36,480
更别把自己赔了进去
especially with yourself.

1491
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:49,780
本片根据真实事件改编

1492
01:55:52,030 --> 01:55:54,930
虽然军火走私方兴未艾

1493
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:58,100
世界最大的武器供应者仍是

1494
01:55:58,330 --> 01:56:00,660
美、俄、法、英、中

1495
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,030
五个联合国常任理事国
