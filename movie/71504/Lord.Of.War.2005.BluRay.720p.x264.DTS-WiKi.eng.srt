<i>- My name is Yuri Orlov.</i>
<i>- ( ''America the Beautiful'' playing )</i>

50

<i>Like most Ukrainians,</i>
<i>we congregated in Brighton Beach.</i>

<i>It reminded us</i>
<i>of the Black Sea.</i>

52
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,858
<i>I soon realized we just swapped</i>

<i>Even in hell,</i>

<i>For the first 20-odd years</i>
<i>of my life,</i>

59
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,688
<i>Little Odessa was to me</i>
<i>what it is to the Q train.</i>

60
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,690
<i>The end of the line.</i>

61
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,691
<i>Oh, I did lie about my name.</i>

62
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,730
<i>It's not really Yuri Orlov.</i>

63
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,959
<i>There have been few occasions</i>
<i>in the 20th Century</i>

Yuri, you're late.

73

<i>My father took his assumed</i>
<i>identity to heart.</i>

74

<i>He was more Jewish</i>
<i>than most Jews,</i>

<i>Catholic mother crazy.</i>

79
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,168

to remind us there is
something above us.

81
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,515
I like that.

82
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,045
- l'm going to temple.
- You're not going to temple.

83
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,385
You go to temple
more than the rabbi.

( speaking Russian )

85
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,288

87
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,664
Yuri:
<i>Growing up in Little Odessa,</i>

88
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,929
<i>murder was an everyday</i>
<i>part of life.</i>

89
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:47,803
<i>Russian mobsters had also</i>
<i>migrated from the Soviet Union.</i>

90
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,173
<i>And when they came to America,</i>
<i>their baggage came with them.</i>

91
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,880
<i>There was always some gangster</i>
<i>getting whacked in my neighborhood.</i>

92
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,007
<i>But l'd never seen it</i>
<i>with my own eyes.</i>

93
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,520
<i>I had this knack of showing up</i>
<i>five minutes before something went down,</i>

94
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,418
<i>or five minutes after.</i>

95
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,787
<i>Not that day.</i>

96
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,175
<i>It hit me.</i>

97
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,446
<i>It couldn't have hit me harder</i>
<i>if I was the one who'd been shot.</i>

98
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,579
<i>You go into the restaurant</i>
<i>business because people are always</i>

99
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,920
<i>going to have to eat.</i>

100
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:43,690
<i>That was the day I realized my destiny</i>
<i>lay in fulfilling another basic human need.</i>

101
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,167
<i>The next Sabbath,</i>
<i>I went to temple with my father.</i>

102
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,797
<i>However, it wasn't God</i>
<i>I was trying to get close to.</i>

103
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,807
Eli, my oldest son Yuri.

104
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,536
<i>My contact at synagogue</i>

105
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,070
<i>landed me my first lsraeli-made</i>
<i>Uzi submachine guns.</i>

106
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,950
<i>The first time you selI a gun</i>
<i>is a lot like the first time you have sex.</i>

107
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,785
<i>You have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

108
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,554
<i>But it is exciting,</i>
<i>and one way or another,</i>

109
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,390
<i>it's over way too fast.</i>

110
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:23,033
Gentlemen, the new Uzi
machine pistol--

111
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,899
big firepower
in a smalI package.

112
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,166
This little baby uses
9mm hollowpoints,

113
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,071
20 25-round extendable mags,

114
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,836
rear-flip adjustable sights.

115
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,401
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoiI reduction.

116
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,448
Muzzle jump reduced 40%,
60% improved noise suppression.

117
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,041
You could pump a mag
into me right now

118
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,552
and never wake the guy
in the next room.

119
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,519
Of course that would eliminate
your opportunity for repeat business.

120
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,357
Yuri: <i>I did have a naturaI instinct</i>
<i>for smuggling contraband.</i>

121
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,992
<i>Fortunately, back then a video camera</i>
<i>was as big as a bazooka.</i>

122
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,544
<i>Here, l'd been running away</i>
<i>from violence my whole life,</i>

123
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,807
<i>and I should have been</i>
<i>running towards it.</i>

124
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,872
<i>It's in our nature.</i>

125
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,216
<i>The earliest human skeletons</i>
<i>had spearheads in their ribcages.</i>

126
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,519
<i># AlI right #</i>

<i># He was a young American... #</i>

130
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,595
Where have you been?
What if we had a customer?

131
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,103
God bless America.

132
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,948
- Mm, mm-hmm. ( gags )
- Yeah?

133
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,251
( speaks Russian )

134
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,827
''Beware of the dog''?

135
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,886
You don't have a dog.
Are you trying to scare people?

136
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,125
No, it's to scare me.

137
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,690
Remind me to be aware
of the dog in me.

138
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,965
The dog that wants
to fuck everything that moves,

139
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,096
wants to fight and kill
weaker dogs.

140
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,631
I guess it's to remind me
to be more human.

141
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,644
lsn't being a dog
part of being human?

142
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,876
What if that's the best part
of you, the dog part?

143
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,213
What if you're really
just a two-legged dog?

144
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,881
You need to see somebody.

145
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,220
It stinks in here.

146
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,886
Yuri: <i>l'd always wanted to do</i>
<i>something big with my life.</i>

147
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,895
<i>I just didn't know what.</i>

148
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,898
<i>Anyhow, I figured if I was</i>

150
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,666
Vitaly, stop fucking around.
I want to talk to you.

151
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,339
You read the newspapers, V?

152
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,275
The newspaper?

153
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,869
It's always the same.

154
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,747
You're right. Every day there's
people shooting each other.

155
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,478
You know what I do
when I see that?

156
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,577
<i>I look to see what guns</i>
<i>they're using,</i>

157
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,350
and I think to myself,
why not my guns?

158
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,856
What, you opening
a gun shop?

159
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,119
Already more of those
in America than McDonald's.

160
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,286
Even with alI the gangsters
around here,

161
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,262
the margins are too low.

162
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,822
- You've worked out the margins?
<i>- Sure.</i>

163
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,334
Forget gang wars.

164
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,396
The reaI money's
in actuaI wars between countries.

165
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,000
Yuri, what the fuck
do you know about guns?

166
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,637
I know which end
l'd rather be on.

167
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,211
I made the first sale.
We're already in business.

168
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,383
Whoa. We?

169
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,549
I need a partner.

170
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,389
I don't know.

171
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,090
Uh, I don't know, Yuri.
I don't know.

172

<i>Vitaly, l've tasted your borscht.</i>
<i>You're no fucking chef.</i>

173
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,598
I can eat in the restaurant
for free, and I stilI don't eat there.

174
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,399
Fuck you.

175
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,736
We're doing nothing
with our lives.

176
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,942
I mean, this is shit.
This is shit.

177
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,144
That's true.

178
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,448
But maybe doing nothing's
better than doing this.

179
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,759
I need you.

180
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,795

Sir, sir, may I interest you

183
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,654
surface-to-air missile?
It's the older Chinese model.

184
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,089
Not so effective
against modern military aircraft,

185
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,593
<i>but deadly if used</i>
<i>against a commerciaI airliner.</i>

<i>was far from thawed.</i>

188
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,034
<i>Most of the deals were</i>

189

<i>It was a mostly private club</i>
<i>with a lifetime club president.</i>

190
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,138
- That's him.
- Who, the big shot?

191
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,838
Simeon Weisz.

192
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,111
Angola, Mozambique,
those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

193
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,948

195
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,324
Mr. Weisz. Mr. Weisz.

196
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,989
It's okay. They're talking.

197
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,897
- May I help?
- Yes, a mutuaI friend, Eli Kurtzman,

198
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,300
from Brighton Beach, import, exports,
said to contact you.

199
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,032
I have a business proposal,

200
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,040
and I thought perhaps
we could discuss it.

201
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,407
I don't think you and l
are in the same business.

202
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,174
You think I just selI guns,
don't you?

203
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,647
I don't. I take sides.

204
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,083
But in the lran-lraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

205
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:46,056
Did you ever consider that l
wanted both sides to lose?

206
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,151
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

207
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,527
You're in the wrong place,
my young friend.

208
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,226
This is no place
for amateurs.

209
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,803
Yuri: <i>Curious how you always revert</i>
<i>to your native tongue in moments</i>

210
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,572
<i>- of extreme anger and ecstasy.</i>

214
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,759
Yuri:
<i>The only option for Vitaly and me</i>

215
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,101
<i>was under the counter gun running.</i>

216
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,572
<i>I got my first break in Lebanon</i>
<i>after the suicide bombing.</i>

217

<i>But I wasn't the only</i>
<i>locaI kid making good.</i>

218
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,088
<i>When the United States</i>
<i>leaves a war zone,</i>

219
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,215
<i>they generally don't take</i>
<i>their munitions.</i>

220
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,422
<i>It costs more to bring it back</i>
<i>than to buy new stock.</i>

221
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,262
So we selI by the kilo.

222
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,633
They're secondhand weapons,
but they're stilI okay.

223
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,832
How many kilos
would you like?

224
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,344
- 5,000.

225
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,471
<i>But I soon discovered that</i>

226
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,846
<i>dinars, drachmas, rubles,</i>
<i>rupees and pounds fucking sterling.</i>

227
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,183
<i>Of course, the US Army</i>
<i>got a piece of the action.</i>

228
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,621
<i>Army salaries were no better</i>
<i>in the '80s than they are today.</i>

229
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,457
<i>And some of the brass,</i>
<i>like Lieutenant ColoneI Southern</i>

230
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,826
<i>needed to raise money</i>
<i>for their own private wars.</i>

231
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,092
Good to make
your acquaintance.

232
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,897
This is bullshit money, V.
This is smalI fucking potatoes.

233

No, more illegal.

00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,206
Let's go. Come on.

00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,048
Yuri: <i>Selling guns is like</i>

<i>You make calls,</i>
<i>pound the pavement, take orders.</i>

<i>I was an equaI opportunity</i>

<i>I sold lsraeli-made Uzis</i>

<i>I also packed six different briefcases,</i>

<i>Without operations like mine,</i>

263
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,737
<i>it would be impossible</i>

265
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,582
<i>I was able to navigate around</i>
<i>those inconvenient little arms embargoes.</i>

How do you spelI that? K-o-n-o.

Okay, well, that's good.
Kono.

Dutch. Got it.

303
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,226

00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,974
- What?
- l've got Belgium.

- So?

310
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,518
Turn it sideways--

311
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,120
it's Dutch. ( laughs )

312

AlI right, good.
Everybody look innocent now.

336

00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,243

Yuri.
It's my brother Yuri.

384
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,779
He's my big brother.

385

What the fuck is that?

386
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,322
Ukraine. I was young.

387
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,793
But I remember. Look.

388
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,887
I start in Odessa, right?

389
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,456
And then I work my way
to the Crimean.

390
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,934
You're gonna be dead
before you fucking reach Kiev.

391
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,733
- Come on, we're going home.
- You fuck!

392

You fucking fuck!
You fucking fuck!

( snorting )

395

396

( sighs )
Get out of the car.

400
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,239
Vitaly, I need you
to get out of the car.

401
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,046

Please.

403
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,180
Vitaly, you're gonna have
a great time. This is a top place.

404
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,190
Two Ford models

409
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,147

410
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,844

411
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,083
- Okay, alI right.
- Good brother.

412
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,650
AlI right,

413
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,696
Get out of the car.

Yuri: <i>From then on,</i>

- Yuri Orlov.

430
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,871
What brings you to St. Bart's?

431
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,674
Photo shoot.
At least that was the plan.

432
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,375
Guess the photographer

Hurricane, though there's nothing

So, the job's been canceled,

601
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,466
<i>Whole tank divisions.</i>

602
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,144
<i>I even landed a squadron</i>
<i>of helicopter gunships--</i>

603
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,325
<i>the most sophisticated</i>
<i>fighting machines,</i>

604
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,460
<i>buiIt for a war with America</i>
<i>that never happened.</i>

605
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,977
<i>Thanks to me, they'd finally</i>
<i>get to fire a shot in anger.</i>

606
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,854
<i>I have a feeling it wasn't exactly</i>
<i>what comrade Lenin</i>

607
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:36,484
<i>had in mind when he advocated</i>
<i>the redistribution of weaIth.</i>

608
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,587
<i>But I wasn't the only one offering</i>
<i>a crash course in capitalism.</i>

609
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,734
<i>I had rivals.</i>

610
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,203
lnform your commanding officer that
Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

611
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,207
You don't know who I am, do you?

612
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,052
You're late.

613
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,251
So it appears.

614
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,007
( speaks Russian )

615
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,013
( imitates gunshot )

616
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:42,525
You look a little lost, Simeon.
ls the world changing too fast?

617
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,527
l'm here, aren't l?

618
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,654
Not alI of you, I think.

619
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,221
You've gotten so rich
selling for the ClA

620
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,235
you can't seem to get that ideology
completely out of your head.

621
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,328
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

622
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,866
Kept attentions frozen.

623
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,536
Now it's harder to determine

624
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,340
which side one's on.

625
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,608
Things have become more complicated.

626
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,377
No, it's gotten simpler.

627
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,851
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore, Simeon.

628
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,945
I selI to leftists and rightists.

629
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:15,890
l'd selI to pacifists but they're not
the most regular of customers.

630
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,451
Of course you're not
a true internationalist

631
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,293
untiI you've supplied weapons
to kilI your own countrymen.

632
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:27,065
This current state of chaos
won't last forever.

633
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,638
There'lI have to be order.

634
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,138
lnstead of cutting
each other's throats,

635
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,807
it may be beneficiaI if we work together.
What do you think?

636
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,879
What do I think?

637
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,514
I think you're the amateur now.

638
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,081
I think you should go with your instincts.

639
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,458
With your first instinct.

640
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,292
l'm the same man who was not
good enough for you before

641
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,493
and l'm just not good enough
for you now.

642
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:14,479
The problem with gunrunners
going to war...

643
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,620
is that there's no shortage
of ammunition.

644
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,121
Yuri: <i>This was the chaos</i>
<i>that the Old Guard had always feared.</i>

645
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:29,097
<i>As far as they were concerned I was</i>
<i>giving arms dealers a bad name.</i>

646
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,465
<i>But then they could hardly report me</i>
<i>to the Better Business Bureau.</i>

647
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,735
<i>And Ukraine</i>
<i>wasn't the only former state</i>

648
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,640
<i>with an unpaid army</i>
<i>and stockpiles of guns.</i>

649
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,372
<i>There was Bulgaria, Hungary,</i>

650
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,880
<i>Poland, Belarus,</i>

651
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,075
<i>alI there for the taking.</i>

652
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,882
<i>Of alI the weapons</i>
<i>in the vast Soviet arsenal</i>

653
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:57,449
<i>nothing was more profitable</i>
<i>than Avtomat Kalashnikova,</i>

654
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,393
<i>modeI of 1 947</i>

655
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:03,297
<i>more commonly known</i>
<i>as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.</i>

656
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,564
<i>It's the world's</i>
<i>most popular assauIt rife.</i>

657
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,628
<i>A weapon alI fighters love.</i>

658
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,038
<i>An elegantly simple</i>
<i>9-lb. amalgamation</i>

659
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,008
<i>of forged steeI and plywood.</i>

660
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,637
<i>It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.</i>

661
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,012
<i>It wilI shoot whether it's covered</i>
<i>in mud or filled with sand.</i>

662
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:22,746
<i>It's so easy even a child</i>
<i>can use it, and they do.</i>

663
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,913
<i>The Soviets put the gun on a coin.</i>

664
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,286
<i>Mozambique put it on their flag.</i>

665
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,224
<i>Since the end of the Cold War</i>
<i>the Kalashnikov has become</i>

666
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,785
<i>the Russian people's greatest export.</i>

667
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,493
<i>After that comes vodka, caviar</i>
<i>and suicidaI novelists.</i>

668
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,831
<i>One thing's for sure.</i>

669
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,427
<i>No one was lining up</i>
<i>to buy their cars.</i>

670
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,336
I thought you were supposed to be
watching out for these people.

671
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,430
How can l?
You keep selling my helicopters.

672
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,942
You are too greedy, Yuri.

673
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,568
I can't hold him forever.

674
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,512
- l've got paperwork.
- Not for the gunships.

675
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:27,209
You know the penaIty
for sanction-busting.

676
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,412
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

677
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,751
Military helicopter.

678
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,194
It's not a military helicopter.

679
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,787
It's a rescue helicopter.

680
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,126
Get to work, son.

681
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,270
The law is on our side.

682
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,690
AlI right, let me see your papers.

683
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:12,320
No, no, put that away.
Let's see your papers.

684
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,830
- Yuri Orlov.
- Mr. Orlov.

685
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,832
Always in the wrong place
at the right time.

686
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,662
We've met before.
Off the coast of Columbia.

687
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,037
What was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember.

688
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,508
Was it Kono
or the Kristol?

689
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:30,012
The crew called
that vesseI a lot of names,

690
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,514
none of them repeatable
in polite company.

691
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,848
- Answer the question.
- The new MP-5.

692
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,910
Would you like a silencer for that?

693
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,478
I need to see your papers.

694
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,685
Dmitri!

695
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,297
the end-user certificate
for this aircraft

696
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,029
states ''Burkina Faso.''

697
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,901
Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

698
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,601
The helicopter is to be used
on humanitarian missions.

699
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,667
- Oh, so you're a humanitarian?
- Oh, absolutely.

700
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,509
( laughs )
This is a military aircraft.

701
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,845
- Not anymore.
- Listen to the nephew.

702
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:11,047
What can they do with military hardware
but convert it to civilian use?

703
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,181
The only way you could die from this
baby now is if a food drop hits you.

704
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,324
And this stuff over here?
ls that going to Burkina Faso as well?

705
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,922
Ah, but to a different client
at a different address.

706
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,731
Just a coincidence, is that it? Do you
take me for a complete fucking fool?

707
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:30,261
Not complete, sir.
And while I hesitate to telI you your job,

708
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,002
I must point out
that when shipped separately

709
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,067
the weapons and the aircraft
both comply

710
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:37,477
with the current lnterpol
trade standards and practices.

711
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:41,005
We both know that is an obscene
bureaucratic loophole

712
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,279
that's gonna be closed
any goddamn day.

713
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,321
But it's not closed.

714
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,654
And while certain people might
interpret this cargo as suspicious,

715
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:52,126
thank God we live in a world where
suspicion alone does not constitute crime.

716
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,130
And where men like you
respect the rule of law.

717
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,403
Yuri: <i>I was as guiIty as sin,</i>
<i>but Valentine couldn't prove it.</i>

718
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,203
<i>And he was the rarest breed</i>
<i>of law enforcement officer.</i>

719
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,107
<i>The type who knew</i>
<i>I was breaking the law</i>

720
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,578
<i>but wouldn't break it himself</i>
<i>to bust me.</i>

721
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,385
<i>Valentine wasn't the only one trying</i>
<i>to put me out of business.</i>

722
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,355
<i>My uncle had turned down</i>
<i>a half dozen rival arms dealers.</i>

723
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,619
<i>Sometimes with offers</i>
<i>better than mine.</i>

724
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:25,992
<i>But to Dmitri, you couldn't</i>
<i>put a price on loyalty.</i>

725
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,403
- What was he doing here?
- He is hoping to beat your offer.

726
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,006
I told him to go have
intercourse with himself.

727
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,677
- But Yuri--
- You need to make more payoffs.

728
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,379
- Too many know.
- Don't worry.

729
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,355
There are more VCRs, cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.

730
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:57,120
Even your enemy
was admiring that car.

731
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,597
( laughing )
I am the luckiest man alive.

732
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,225
You are.

733
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,263
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

734
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,206
- Hello?
- Ava?

735
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,243
Hi, baby.

736
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,505
You forget what time it is?

737
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,104
l'm sorry, l--

738
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,208
how was that--
your audition?

739
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,810
They're going in another direction.

740
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,015
Direction of someone who can act.

741
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,682
They don't deserve you.

742
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,656
Where are you?
is everything okay?

743
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,862
It was a rough day
at the office.

744
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,300
<i>- Come home.</i>
- Soon.

745
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,736
- How's Nicki?
<i>- He misses you.</i>

746
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,740
<i>We both do.</i>

747
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,538
It's lonely without you here.

748
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,408
You know I don't like nights.

749
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,380
Ever since my parents.

750
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,417
<i>( gunfire )</i>

751
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,991

A party.
I better go.

753
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,486

<i>A gunrunner's wet dream.</i>

What an honor.

775
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,976
Thank him, but unfortunately
I have other business.

776
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:04,809
It's a shame.
It's a very busy schedule.

777

( laughing )

778
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,347
It is not...

779
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,859
as they say, optional.

780
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,455
My father is easily offended.

781
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,557
My schedule just freed up.

782
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,067

Yuri: <i>President Baptiste</i>

787

<i>His seven-year civiI war</i>

<i>a relentless campaign</i>
<i>of sadistic wanton violence.</i>

789

without setting off a lot
of bells and whistles.

00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,959
Personally,
I do not recommend that.

<i>for a traditionaI wheeI gun,</i>

797
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,408
there is no substitute for
the six inches of muzzle energy

798
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:10,037
of the .357 Magnum.
And of course, it wilI never jam.

799
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,212
Why'd you do that?!

800
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,047
What did you say?

801
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,646
WelI now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

804
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,821
( chuckles )
A used gun.

805
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:33,062

You know, there is no discipline

I try to set an example
but it is difficuIt.

809

You forget ancillary costs.

You know, they calI me
the Lord of War,

908
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07,094
but perhaps it is you.

909
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,901
It's not Lord of War.
It's Warlord.

910
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,869
Thank you,

Yuri: <i>Conflict diamonds are</i>

I can't believe it.

919
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,569
Well, of course
it's wonderful. I just--

920
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,106
I didn't expect it
to happen so soon.

Yes, well, that--

well, that would

It's wonderful.
Thank you so much.

It's-- Yuri.
Okay, thank you. Bye.

925
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,693
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.
I just sold my first painting.

926
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,030
That's fantastic!

927
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,661
( laughing )
Who bought it?

928
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,228
Someone important.
They wanna remain anonymous.

929
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:20,037
- This is so wonderful.
- Yeah, how was your trip?

930
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,543
You know, same old, same old.
Where's Nicki?

931

ln bed. l'm sorry.
He couldn't stay up.

932
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,338
- Well, that's best.
- My first painting.

933
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,975
l'm officially an artist.

934
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:32,715
- This calls for a drink.
- What doesn't?

935
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,916
Hi.

936
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:37,755
- Yuri, this is, uh, uh...
- Candy.

937
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,227
- Candy, of course.
- Hi.

938
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,230
Any friend of my brother's

939
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,631

- Okay.

How are you, brother?

945
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,966
Oh, you know,

946

stilI the resident family fuck up.

947
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:59,530
Yeah, well, I guess
someone has to do it.

948
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,578
Yeah.

949
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:06,137
Hey, Ava knows, right?

950
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,318
I never want to say anything.

951
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,880
She doesn't have to know.
She understands.

952
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:18,189
She's a survivor, like me.

953
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,456
Well, she may be a survivor,

954
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,795
but she's not like you.

955
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,799
Really, she doesn't know how
you pay for alI this?

956
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,861
We don't talk about it.

957
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:33,500
How many car salesmen
talk about their work, huh?

958
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,510
How many cigarette salesmen?
Both their products

You really are.

964
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,662
You almost had me convinced.

965
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,970
Could you, uh...

966
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:14,016
could you help me out
with some...

967
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:21,885
Why?

968
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,892
Why?

969
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,396
Why?

970
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,522
Why what?

971
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,057
- Why, why, why, why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

972
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,160
Why what?

973
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:38,139
Why are you so fucked up
alI the time?

974
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,110
Because I am.

975
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,955
Yuri: <i>I didn't know how much</i>
<i>Ava really knew</i>

976
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,359
<i>and how much she ignored.</i>

977
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,262
<i>She never questioned how a guy</i>
<i>in the transport business</i>

978
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,994
<i>could afford to give her</i>
<i>1 8-karat diamond earrings.</i>

979
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,435
<i>I guess she didn't really want</i>
<i>to hear the answer.</i>

980
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,804
<i>Mostly, she seemed content</i>
<i>that I was a good provider,</i>

981
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,742
<i>and as far as she</i>
<i>was concerned, loyal.</i>

982
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:18,803
<i>Despite the other women,</i>
<i>I always made love to Ava</i>

983
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,940

984

<i>l'm not saying</i>
<i>I didn't have setbacks.</i>

985

<i>It's not called</i>
<i>''gunrunning'' for nothing.</i>

<i>You gotta be fast</i>

<i>Some revolutions blow over</i>

<i>There's nothing more expensive</i>

989
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,223
Truce?
What do you mean truce?

990
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:42,135
The guns are already
on their way.

991
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:45,071
Peace talks.

992

AlI right, forget it.
l'lI reroute the shipment to the Balkans.

When they say they're gonna

Yuri: <i>Of course,</i>
<i>a new breed of gun-runner</i>

there are men
going through our garbage cans.

1003
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:12,192
It's probably just some reporters
looking for somebody else.

1004

I have a feeling
they don't work for the tabloids.

No, nothing.

Hey, don't be shy.
Here, look. Free sample.

1061

Help yourself, okay?
Free sample. TelI your friends.

Come here.
You want something? Look.

Happy times. Come on.
Help yourselves.

1065
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,891
No charge.
Everything goes.

01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,797
Guns, guns, guns.
Yeah, come on up!

1067
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,801
Yeah, having fun now, huh?

1068

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Guns, guns, guns! Yeah!</i>

1069
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,566
Bullets, guns, grenades.

1070
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:05,272
Hooray, yeah, take 'em all.
Take the whole crate.

1071
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:09,545
Go ahead, take the crate.
Everybody, come on.

1072
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:12,485

<i>Bullets, guns, grenades!</i>

1074
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,582
<i>Yeah!</i>

1075
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,149
That one's got
your name on it.

1076
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,958
You want one, too? Come on.
We got bullets.

1077
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,725
<i>Don't forget the bullets.</i>

1078
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,461
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

1079
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,730
Everything goes for free.

1080
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,295
<i>Guns, grenades, RPGs,</i>

1081

01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:37,072
<i>Hooray, hooray!</i>
<i>Want some bullets?</i>

1083
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,478
<i>Gotta have bullets.</i>

1084
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,449
<i>What a cargo crew at</i>

Yuri Orlov.

1089
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:05,638
- Ow, fuck!
- You run from us?

1090
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,197
No, Mbizi, no.

1091
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,938
Can he run with no legs?

1092
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:13,277
Let me make him disappear, Mr. Valentine.
Around here, people disappear alI the time.

1093
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,714
- I can't do that.
- Look where we are.

1094
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:19,720
Who wilI know?

1095
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,154
We will.

1096
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,454
He's gonna get
what's coming to him.

1097
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,465
l'm not as certain.

1098
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:36,068

1099
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,268
AlI right, get up.

1100
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:49,047
- What's the charge?
- What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

1101
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:53,850
- l'm on safari.
- Yeah, you're hunting wildebeests

1102
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,891
- with a submachine gun?
- Do you also work with the Park Service?

1103
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,984
Hunting without a license.
ls that the charge?

1104
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:02,724
Why are we playing games?
You traffic arms.

1105
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:05,289
- Trade.
- Trade, traffic.

1106
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:09,303
You get rich by giving
the poorest people on the planet

1107
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,305
the means to continue
killing each other.

1108
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,034
Do you know why I do
what I do?

1109
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:16,100
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

1110
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,805
Keeping track
of nuclear arsenals.

1111
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,111
You'd think that more critical
to world security, but it's not.

1112
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,549
No, nine out of 10
war victims today

1113
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,952
are killed with assauIt rifles
and smalI arms like yours.

1114
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:29,081
Those nuclear missiles,
they sit in their silos.

1115
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:33,389
Your AK-47, that is the reaI weapon
of mass destruction.

1116
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,397
I don't want people dead,
Agent Valentine.

1117
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:39,559
I don't put a gun to anybody's
head and make them shoot.

1118
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,536
I admit, a shooting war's
better for business,

1119
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,595
but I prefer people to fire
my guns and miss,

1120
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,607
just as long as they're firing.

1121
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,416
Can I go now?
You've got nothing on me.

1122
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,979
Except cuffs.

1123
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:07,018
<i>Since you're so concerned</i>
<i>with the law,</i>

1124
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:11,156
you must know l'm legally permitted
to hold you for 24 hours

1125
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,396
without charging you.
You might ask why I would do that.

1126
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:17,199
And I can assure you it's not because
I enjoy your company,

1127
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,899
because I don't.
No.

1128
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,943
The reason why I wilI delay you
for every second

1129
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,036
of the permissible 24 hours
is I am delaying

1130
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:28,139
your deadly trade
and the deaths of your victims.

1131
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:32,084
I don't think of it as taking a day
from you, but giving a day to them.

1132
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,281
Some innocent man, woman or child

1133
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,620
is going to have
an extra day on this earth

1134
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,592
because you're not free.

1135
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:42,358
So, I wilI see you...

1136
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,763
in 23 hours

1137
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,199

<i>There was nowhere to go.</i>

1141
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:00,479
<i>Or maybe he was hoping</i>
<i>the locals would tear me apart.</i>

1142
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,609
<i>But they were too busy with the plane.</i>

1143

<i>It's like parking your car in certain</i>

A gift for you.

You know,
you've arrived just in time.

1151
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,073
I was afraid that he might die

1152
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,778
before you got your chance

1153

1154

I am here to supply his enemies.

01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:27,719
I fear it's a sale

1160
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,793
He killed your blood.

- No?

1164

01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,097
- ( groans )
- Don't! He's Andre's.

1214
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:08,267
- Fuck Andre.
- Yeah, fuck Andre.

1215
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:11,002
( gun clicks )

1216
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,910
l'm sorry.
they don't usually do that.

1217
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,575
( gun clicks )

1218
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,982
Well, let me look at it.
Maybe I can fix it

1219
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,647
Let me see it.
It's the magazine. Give it to me.

1220
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:23,748
- ( groans )
- Fuck you!

1221
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,066
( growling )

1222
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,648
Yuri:
<i>I started to feeI l'd been cursed.</i>

1223
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,950
<i>The curse of invincibility.</i>

1224
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,656
( imitating gunshots )

1225
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,158
Nicki, please go to your room.

1226
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,530
I don't believe you.

1227
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,900
Can you prove any of this?

1228
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:13,338
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble

1229
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,137
to make his business
look legitimate.

1230
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:19,146
<i>Even to you.</i>
<i>Perhaps especially to you.</i>

1231
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:22,183
I don't expect we're gonna find
anything here today.

1232
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,547
So what do you want?

1233
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:28,318
I was hoping that you would help me.

1234
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:38,156
I understand that, uh...

1235
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:41,066
your parents died tragically.

1236
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:48,306
<i>The illegaI firearms used</i>
<i>to murder your mother and father</i>

1237
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:51,812
were procured from men
exactly like your husband.

1238
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:56,080
l'd like you to leave.

1239
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,189
Okay.
Gentlemen.

1240
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,869
<i>( door opens, shuts )</i>

1241
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,702
Ava?

1242
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:29,374
Ava. what's wrong?

1243
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:32,886
I can't wear the clothes.

1244
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,445
I can't wear the jewelry.

1245
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,158
I can't drive the car.

1246
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:43,027
Can't live in this house.

1247
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:45,429
Everything's got blood on it.

1248
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,468
<i>Blood on it?</i>

1249
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:51,438
What's the matter with you?

1250
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:58,006
- Don't be so melodramatic.
- Of course l'm melodramatic.

1251
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,048
l'm a failed actress, remember?

1252
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:11,789
I told you,
these people, it's political.

1253
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,020
They lie.
They're liars.

1254
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:17,292
Look at me. Look. They lie to make
themselves look good, okay?

1255
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:19,094
You can't--
you can't trust them.

1256
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:21,067
It's not just them.

1257
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:26,038
Don't worry.
Your family didn't say anything.

1258
01:27:26,107 --> 01:27:28,598
They didn't have to.

1259
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:33,007
I selI people a means

1260
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,175
to defend themselves, Ava.
That's all.

1261
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,219
Yuri, I see the news.

1262
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:40,516
I see those pictures.

1263
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,249
The guns are bigger than the boys.

1264
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:44,951
There is nothing illegaI about what I do.

1265
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,256
I don't care if it's legal.

1266
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,819
It's wrong.

1267
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:10,478
Please stop.

1268
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,317
It makes no difference if I stop.

1269
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,382
Someone wilI take my place
the next day.

1270
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:21,519
So let them.
We have enough.

1271
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:25,856
It's not about the money.

1272
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,798
Then what is it?

1273
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:34,541
l'm good at it.

1274
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:47,980
I feeI like alI l've done
my whole life is be pretty.

1275
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,547
I mean,

1276
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,321
alI l've done is be born.

1277
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:58,023
l'm a failed actress,
a failed artist.

1278
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,693
l'm not much good as a mother.

1279
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:06,267
Come to think of it,
l'm not even that pretty anymore.

1280
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:13,478
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1281
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:17,976
But I won't faiI as a human being.

1282
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:26,515
Yuri: <i>My enemies had finally found</i>
<i>a weapon that could hurt me.</i>

1283
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:30,295
<i>For the next six months</i>
<i>I stopped running guns.</i>

1284
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,697
<i>- I went legitimate.</i>
- This is an untapped market.

1285
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:36,828
l'm talking over five million cubic meters
of timber in the first year alone.

1286
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:39,099
Over 100 exploitable species.

1287
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:42,142
<i>The oil? Between you and me,</i>
<i>this is the new Texas.</i>

1288
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,405
<i>What do you say to over</i>
<i>10,000 barrels a month?</i>

1289
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,073
He must be lying.

1290
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:49,116
He's talking.

1291
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:52,482
<i>There's gas reserves off the lvory Coast</i>
<i>that OPEC doesn't know about.</i>

1292
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,544
The phone numbers alI check out.

1293
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,283
It's alI on the level.

1294
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,294
Yuri:
<i>No wonder Valentine was confused.</i>

1295
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:07,960
<i>( church bells ringing )</i>

1296
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:17,340
<i>Thank God</i>
<i>there are stilI legaI ways</i>

1297
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,744
<i>to exploit developing countries.</i>

1298
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:21,941
<i>But the only problem</i>
<i>with an honest buck</i>

1299
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,449
<i>is they're so hard to make.</i>

1300
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:25,349
<i>The margins are too low.</i>

1301
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,479
<i>Too many people are doing it.</i>

1302
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:34,517
<i>Still, l'd promised Ava.</i>

1303
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:46,173
Yuri, the president of Liberia
is on his way up.

1304
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,672
He's early.

1305
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:53,440
- l'lI be back in a minute.
- Okay.

1306
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:01,482
What the fuck
are you doing here, Andre?

1307
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:03,854
We are here for peace talks
at the United Nations.

1308
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:05,893
So at the same time you thought
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

1309
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,418
WelI I was beginning to wonder
whether that was stilI your profession.

1310
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:12,330
You know you're a hard man
to get a hold of alI of a sudden.

1311
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,925
That is a shame.

1312
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:18,267
My son and l, we were hoping
to do a little shopping

1313
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:21,467
- while we are here in New York.
- You know they're watching you.

1314
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:25,342
Yes, I know they blame me. They blame
me for everything, those hypocrites.

1315
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:28,576
- They're on a hunt for a witch.
- Witch-hunt.

1316
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,140
Hostilities have escalated.

1317
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:34,848
They are making it very difficuIt
for me to resupply.

1318
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:37,015
That requires a man

1319
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:40,026
of your rare ingenuity.

1320
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:44,031
I can't help you.
l'm sorry.

1321
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,864
I understand.

1322
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:56,210
But you should know this.

1323
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:59,644
Due to our present situation
we are compelled

1324
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:02,080
to be unusually generous.

1325
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,516
So see you soon,

1326
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:11,353
Lord of War.

1327
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:17,930
You stilI haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

1328
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:24,166
( laughs )

1329
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:36,479
Yuri:
<i>At four and a half months old</i>

1330
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,679
<i>a human fetus has a reptile's tail--</i>

1331
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:41,722
<i>a remnant of our evolution.</i>

1332
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,848
<i>Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.</i>

1333
01:32:43,925 --> 01:32:46,223
<i>You can fight</i>
<i>a lot of enemies and survive.</i>

1334
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:49,195
<i>But if you fight your biology</i>
<i>you wilI always lose.</i>

1335
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:52,721
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?
l'm not leaving for another 10 minutes.

1336
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,132
- Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
- Oh, okay.

1337
01:32:55,202 --> 01:32:57,397
You know, l'm kind of glad
you're going.

1338
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:00,269
You've been here so long
you're starting to get on my nerves.

1339
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:02,866
This oiI concession should be
wrapped up by Thursday.

1340
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:04,935
l'lI be back for the weekend.
We'lI go somewhere.

1341
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,981
- The sea.
- That would be fun.

1342
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:10,711
- Come on.
- Hey.

1343
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:13,447
You trust me, right?

1344
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:17,616
Yuri: <i>She looked me directly</i>

01:33:21,896 --> 01:33:24,057
Yes, I trust you.

1348
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:26,827
<i>And she lied without flinching.</i>

1349
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:30,132
- l'lI see you, big guy.
- Bye, Papa.

1350
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:32,104
Yuri:
<i>She learned from the best.</i>

1351
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:34,403
Have a good trip.

- It's a game, honey.

1365
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:17,876
Like hide and seek?

1366
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:20,079
Yes.

1367
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,714
Like hide and seek.

1368

<i># Who got to you... #</i>

1372
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:45,375
Yuri: <i>I can always sense</i>
<i>when l'm being tailed.</i>

1373
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:47,175
<i>I know what to look for.</i>

1374
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:50,376
<i>But then l've never been tailed</i>

01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:04,820
Yuri:
<i>I can put myself in Ava's place.</i>

1380
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:07,231
<i>She might have understood</i>

<i>But not Nicolai's.</i>

as a catalogue of carnage.

Come to see
how the other half lives?

1390
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,243
I miss your borscht.

1391
01:37:07,321 --> 01:37:09,653
- Mom and Dad say you're clean.
- Yeah, you too.

1392
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:14,893
You went legit, huh?
That's hard to believe.

1393
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:17,260
That's because it's not true.

1394
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:21,831
Only you know.
l'm leaving tonight on a job.

I want you to come.

1396

I can't.

1397
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,299
l've got a girlfriend.

1398
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:32,811
I think she might be the one.

1399
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,610
Plus l'm thinking
of opening my own place.

1400
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:38,675
Maybe this trip wilI help.
It's good money.

1401
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:43,686
Yuri...

1402
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,691
l've given my word.

1403

No one has to know.

We'lI telI them we're going
for a little R&R.

01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:54,734
What do you need me for
alI of a sudden?

1406
01:37:54,802 --> 01:37:57,202
West Africa's fucked up.

1407
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:59,501
More than usual.

1408
01:37:59,573 --> 01:38:01,803
I can't trust anybody.

1409
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:06,706
I need you to watch my back.

01:38:48,889 --> 01:38:50,948
Welcome back.

1413
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:53,585
Welcome, both of you.

1414

Welcome to democracy.

1415
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:57,828
Democracy?
What have you been drinking, Andy?

1416
01:38:57,898 --> 01:39:00,025
You have not seen the news.

1417
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,432
You know, they accuse me
of rigging elections.

1418
01:39:02,503 --> 01:39:05,472
But after this,
with your Florida

1419
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:07,905
and your Supreme Court
of kangaroos, now

1420
01:39:07,975 --> 01:39:10,205
the US must shut up forever.

1422

How do you do this, Yuri, huh?

1423
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:19,846
How do you do this

when they are watching
alI of my airspace?

1425

- Where there's a wilI there's a weapon.

1426
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:28,157
Come on, where's my fucking money?

1427
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,668
When it is delivered.

1428
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:38,732
- It is delivered.
- This is not for me.

1429
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:41,138
This is for my neighbors to the west.

1430

Vitaly:
<i>The west?</i>

- Look. Look over there.

It's not our business.

Right.

Okay, what's the deal?
300 RPGs,

500 assauIt rifles

Confused.

<i>what was going on in his head.</i>

I beg your pardon.
May I see another stone?

1495
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:56,628
Yuri:
<i>One thing I do understand for certain</i>

1496
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:59,825
<i>is that Vitaly broke</i>
<i>the cardinaI rule of gunrunning.</i>

<i>Never pick up a gun</i>
<i>and join the customers.</i>

What are you doing?

01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:17,312
Something for Yuri.

1500
01:44:18,552 --> 01:44:20,884
Step away.
Slow.

( gasps )

1505
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:12,691
Yuri:
<i>Only half the guns were gone</i>

1506
01:46:12,766 --> 01:46:15,530
<i>so I was stilI entitled</i>
<i>to half the diamonds.</i>

1507
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,536
<i>lf I took them, I was lost.</i>

1508

<i>lf I left them, I was lost.</i>

1509

<i>The massacre played out</i>
<i>exactly how Vitaly predicted.</i>

1510

<i>But then a half dozen other massacres</i>
<i>happened in Sierra Leone that week.</i>

1511
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:38,450
<i>You can't stop them all.</i>

1512
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:40,959
<i>ln my experience,</i>
<i>you can't stop any of them.</i>

<i>( gunfire )</i>

<i>They say ''eviI prevails</i>
<i>when good men faiI to act. ''</i>

1515
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:50,696
<i>What they ought to say</i>
<i>is ''eviI prevails. ''</i>

We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

1529

Curiously, the death certificate

1540
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:17,281
Falsifying a death certificate?

1541

Fake end-user certificates.

01:49:37,737 --> 01:49:40,501
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

1548

There is hardly a warlord,

You have broken

There is enough evidence

My wife and son have left me.

sadistic men calling
themselves leaders today.

are the enemies of your enemies.

1602

sometimes it's embarrassing to have
his fingerprints on the guns.

1606
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:19,516
Sometimes he needs
a freelancer like me

1607
01:53:19,592 --> 01:53:22,356
to supply forces
he can't be seen supplying.
