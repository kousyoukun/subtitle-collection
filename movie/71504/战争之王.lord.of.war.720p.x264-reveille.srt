1
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,700
There are over 550 million firearms

2
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,134
in world-wide circulation.

3
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:18,706
That's one firearm for every

4
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:21,002
twelve people on the planet.

5
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:23,107
The only question is...

6
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,781
how do we arm the other eleven?

7
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,873
You don't have to worry.

8
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:41,272
I'm not gonna tell you a pack of
lies to make me look good.

9
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:43,776
I'm just gonna tell you
what happened.

10
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:45,744
My name is Yuri Orlov.

11
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:49,146
When I was a boy,
my family came to America.

12
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,014
But not all the way.

13
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,051
Like most Ukrainians,

14
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,485
we gathered in Brighton Beach.

15
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,989
It reminded us of the Black Sea.

16
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,661
I soon realized we'd just swapped

17
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:00,796
one hell for another.

18
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,857
Even in hell, an angel

19
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,625
sometimes makes an appearance.

20
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,337
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine

21
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,471
since I was 10 years old.

22
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:12,301
Of course, she didn't know I existed.

23
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:16,069
I was starting to think she had a point.

24
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,251
For the first twenty-odd years of my life...

25
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:25,182
...Little Odessa was to me what it
is to the Q train...

26
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:27,050
...the end of the line.

27
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,349
"Little Odessa," New York - 1982

28
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,189
Oh, I did lie about my name.

29
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,397
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

30
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:35,496
There've been few occasions
in the in the 20th century...

31
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,031
when it's been an advantage be a Jew.

32
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:40,499
But in the 'seventies,
to escape the Soviet Union,

33
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:42,933
our family pretended to be Jewish.

34
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:45,836
Little about my life has been
kosher ever since

35
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:47,567
How's it going, brother?

36
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,841
It's not.

37
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,742
That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

38
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:53,108
He was as lost as me.

39
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,409
He didn't know it yet.

40
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:55,584
Yuri,

41
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,082
you're late.

42
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,926
My father took his assumed
identity to heart.

43
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,391
He was more Jewish than most Jews.

44
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,655
Which drove my Catholic mother crazy.

45
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:09,797
How many times?

46
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,264
I can't eat shellfish.

47
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:13,026
It's treyf.

48
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,396
You're not Jewish.

49
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:15,900
I like it.

50
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,841
I like the hat.

51
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,907
To remind us there is something...

52
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,305
above us.

53
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:24,814
I like that.

54
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:28,485
I'm going to temple.

55
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:29,515
You're not going to temple.

56
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,688
You go to temple more than the rabbi.

57
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:33,219
Get off my back, woman.

58
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:35,618
God, will you ever wise up?

59
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,260
Yuri, don't forget to check

60
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,430
the specials at the Palace.

61
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,089
Growing up in Little Odessa,

62
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,666
murder was everyday part of life.

63
00:06:45,903 --> 00:06:47,530
Russian mobsters had also
migrated

64
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:48,898
from the Soviet Union

65
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,630
and when they came to America,

66
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,968
their baggage came with them.

67
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:55,645
There was always some gangster

68
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,313
getting whacked in my
neighborhood,

69
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:59,812
but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.

70
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,985
I had this knack of showing up
five minutes before something went down,

71
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,678
or five minutes after.

72
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:06,521
Not that day.

73
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:31,905
It hit me.

74
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,047
It couldn't have hit me harder

75
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:35,343
if I was the one who'd been shot.

76
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:37,051
You go into the restaurant business...

77
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:40,519
because people are always going
to have to eat.

78
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:42,453
That was the day I realized my destiny...

79
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:45,924
...lay in fulfilling another basic
human need.

80
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,067
The next Sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.

81
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:55,329
However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.

82
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:57,632
Eli, my eldest son, Yuri.

83
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,570
My contact at synagogue landed me

84
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,769
my first Israeli-made Uzi
submachine guns.

85
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:08,349
The first time you sell a gun...

86
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,952
is a lot like the first time you have sex.

87
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,281
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing.

88
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:16,049
But it is exciting and one way
or another,

89
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,284
it's over way too fast.

90
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,196
Gentlemen.

91
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,658
The new Uzi machine pistol.

92
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:26,426
Big firepower in a small package.

93
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,501
This little baby uses 9 mm hollow points.

94
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:30,798
Twenty twenty-five round extendable mags...

95
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,303
...rear-flip adjustable sights.

96
00:08:32,543 --> 00:08:34,511
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoil reduction.

97
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,042
Muzzle jump reduced forty percent.

98
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,872
Sixty percent improved noise
suppression.

99
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,742
You could pump a mag into me

100
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,178
right now

101
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:43,443
and never wake the guy
in the next room.

102
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,189
Of course, that would eliminate your

103
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:48,584
opportunity for repeat business.

104
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,227
I did have a natural instinct

105
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,123
for smuggling contraband.

106
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:55,195
Fortunately, back then a video camera

107
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:57,696
was a big as a bazooka

108
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:06,867
Here I'd been running away from violence

109
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,444
my whole life, and I should've
run towards it.

110
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,448
It's in our nature.

111
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:14,150
The earliest human skeletons had

112
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,819
spearheads in their rib cages.

113
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:29,662
Where have you been?

114
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,367
What if we had a customer?

115
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:33,331
God bless America.

116
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,424
Beware of the dog?
You don't have a dog.

117
00:09:58,662 --> 00:09:59,594
Are you trying to scare people?

118
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,297
No, it's to scare me.

119
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,029
Remind me to be aware of the dog in me.

120
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:06,431
The dog wants to fuck everything
that moves

121
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,831
Wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.

122
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:11,735
I guess it's to remind me to be
more human.

123
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,809
Isn't being a dog part of being human?

124
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:18,708
What if that's the best part of you?
The dog part.

125
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,850
What if you're really just a
two-legged dog?

126
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,452
You need to see somebody.

127
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,122
Stinks in here.

128
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,292
I'd always wanted to do something
big with my life

129
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,427
I just didn't know what.

130
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:33,652
Anyhow, I figured,

131
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,524
if I was going into the gun trade,

132
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,358
I was going aim high.

133
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:38,659
Vitaly, stop fucking around.

134
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,665
I want to talk to you.

135
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,309
You read the newspapers, Vit?

136
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:49,478
Newspaper? It's always the same.

137
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:50,839
You're right.

138
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:52,946
Every day there's people shooting
each other.

139
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,174
You know what I do when I see that?

140
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,613
I look to see what guns they're using

141
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:58,845
and I think to myself, why not my guns?

142
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,147
What, are you opening a gun shop?

143
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,155
Already more of those in than
McDonald's.

144
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,089
Even with all the gangsters around here,

145
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:06,796
the margins are too low.

146
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,556
You've figured the margins?
Sure.

147
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,296
Forget gang wars.

148
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:14,504
The real money is in actual wars.

149
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,365
Between countries.

150
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,508
Yuri, what the fuck do you know
about guns?

151
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:21,768
I know which end I'd rather be on.

152
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,775
I made the first sale.

153
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,145
We're already in business.

154
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,947
Whoa, whoa. We?

155
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:33,918
I need a partner.

156
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,855
I don't know,

157
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:40,586
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

158
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,458
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.

159
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,598
You're no fucking chef.

160
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:44,892
I can eat in the restaurant for free

161
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,035
and I still don't eat there.

162
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,295
Fuck you.

163
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,064
We're doing nothing with our lives.

164
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:55,807
I mean, this is shit!

165
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:57,445
This is shit!

166
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:00,911
It's true.

167
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,847
But maybe doing nothing's
better than doing this.

168
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,119
I need you.

169
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,517
Brothers in arms.

170
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,697
Brothers in arms.

171
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,849
Sir, may I interest you in the

172
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,645
shoulder-fired SA-7
surface-to-air missiles?

173
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:39,014
The older Chinese model.

174
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,280
Not so effective against

175
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,355
modern military aircraft. But deadly...

176
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,117
if used against a commercial airliner.

177
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,625
I'm giving them away at 8-50.

178
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:51,261
In the '80s, and the Cold War was
far from thawed

179
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,800
Most of the deals were
government-to-government.

180
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:55,299
It was a mostly private club...

181
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:57,871
...with a lifetime club president.

182
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:01,106
That's him.
The big shot?

183
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,939
Simeon Weisz, Angola,
Mozambique,

184
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:06,615
those Exocet missiles
in the Falklands.

185
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,341
He was selling guns before
there was gunpowder.

186
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:11,680
Be right back.

187
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:17,258
Mr. Weisz? Mr. Weisz!

188
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:19,922
It's okay, they're talking.

189
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,657
May I help?

190
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,457
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman

191
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,428
from Brighton Beach,

192
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,863
import/export said to contact you.

193
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:28,366
I have a business proposal

194
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,903
and I thought perhaps we could
discuss it.

195
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,008
I don't think you and I are
in the same business.

196
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,975
You think I just sell guns,
don't you?

197
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:38,704
I don't. I take sides.

198
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,908
But in the Iran-lraq war
you sold guns to both sides.

199
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:46,816
Did you ever consider that
I wanted both sides to lose?

200
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:51,888
Bullets change governments far
surer than votes.

201
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,393
You're in the wrong place,
my young friend.

202
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:56,656
This is no place for amateurs.

203
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:01,501
Motherfucker.

204
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,399
Curious how you always revert to
your native tongue

205
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,200
in moments of extreme anger.

206
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:07,933
And ecstasy.

207
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:13,477
Oh God... Oh, God!

208
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,483
You are beautiful.

209
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,752
What's your name again?

210
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,293
The only option for Vitaly and me

211
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:35,767
was under-the-counter gunrunning.

212
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,572
Beirut, Lebanon - 1984

213
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:39,241
I got my first break in Lebanon

214
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,774
after the suicide bombing.

215
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:47,045
But I wasn't the only local kid
making good.

216
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,517
When the United States leaves a war zone...

217
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:55,554
they generally don't take
their munitions.

218
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:56,690
It costs more to bring it back

219
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:58,895
than to buy new stock.

220
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:02,699
So, we sell by the kilo.

221
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:03,763
They're secondhand weapons,

222
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,593
but they're still okay.

223
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,462
How many kilos would you like?

224
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:11,571
Five thousand.

225
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,072
I had a flair for languages...

226
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:17,075
...but I soon discovered that what
talks best is dollars, dinars...

227
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:20,806
...drachmas, rubles, rupees, and
pounds-fucking-sterling.

228
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,849
Of course, the U.S. Army got a
piece of the action.

229
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:27,454
Army salaries were no better then
than they are today.

230
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:28,419
And some of the brass,

231
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,422
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern...

232
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:33,323
needed to raise money for their
own private wars.

233
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,497
Good to make your acquaintance.

234
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,800
This is bullshit money,

235
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,026
This is small-fucking-potatoes.

236
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,532
What do you want to do, go more legit?

237
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:43,467
No, more illegal.

238
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,071
What I would give right now

239
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:47,709
for cabbage and potatoes.

240
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:16,238
It's not our fight.

241
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:18,472
Vit, come on!

242
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,875
Let's go. Come on.

243
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,658
Selling guns is like selling
vacuum cleaners.

244
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:36,517
You make calls,

245
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,488
pound the pavement,

246
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:38,524
take orders.

247
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:41,026
I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.

248
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,131
I supplied every army but the
Salvation Army.

249
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,739
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

250
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:58,104
I sold communist-made bullets
to fascists.

251
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,640
I hope you're not thinking of
selling these, Mr. Orlov.

252
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:02,181
Personal use.

253
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:03,181
Personal use.

254
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,149
There's a hundred thousand
bullets here.

255
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:07,084
I'm kind of trigger happy.

256
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:08,552
Trigger happy?

257
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:16,194
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan

258
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:19,197
when they were still fighting my
fellow Soviets.

259
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,404
I never sold to Osama Bin Laden.

260
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:22,866
Not on any moral grounds.

261
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:26,007
Back then, he was always
bouncing checks.

262
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:36,180
By the mid-'80s...

263
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,081
my weapons were represented in eight...

264
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,881
...of the world's top ten war zones.

265
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,820
There's no problem leading a double life.

266
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:13,420
It's the triple and quadruple lives

267
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:14,919
that get you in the end.

268
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,752
Back then, I carried a... French,
British, Israeli,

269
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:19,086
and Ukrainian passport...

270
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:20,887
...and a student visa for the U.S.,

271
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,860
but... that's another story.

272
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,125
I also packed six different briefcases...

273
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:27,063
...depending on who I was that day

274
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:29,431
and the region of the world I was visiting.

275
00:18:30,207 --> 00:18:34,007
North of Cartagena, Colombia - 1989

276
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:36,168
Without operations like mine,

277
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,347
would be impossible for certain
countries

278
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:41,050
to conduct a respectable war.

279
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:42,478
I was able to navigate around those

280
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,415
inconvenient little arms embargoes.

281
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:47,623
There are three basic types
of arms deal.

282
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:48,756
White, being legal.

283
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:50,254
Black, being illegal,

284
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:53,429
and my personal favorite color, gray.

285
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:55,756
Sometimes I made the deal
so convoluted...

286
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,330
it was hard for me to work out

287
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:58,795
if they were on the level.

288
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,127
To keep authorities in the dark

289
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,099
I often spoke in code.

290
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,704
Rocket launchers were "mothers."

291
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,202
The rockets, "children."

292
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:09,105
The AK-47 assault rifle was
the "Angel King."

293
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:14,340
It's Yuri... Yeah. Well, Raoul...

294
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:18,020
Raoul, the Angel King will arrive tomorrow.

295
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:21,046
Hallelujah to you, too.

296
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,521
The point is, if I've done my job right

297
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,254
an arms embargo should be
practically impossible to enforce.

298
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,022
What?

299
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:33,031
Okay, just slow the fuck down.

300
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,567
I can't understand you.

301
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:37,637
Wha-What do you mean, tipped off?

302
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:40,434
They know where we are?
Well, where are they?

303
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:43,202
Well, how long have I got?
Not long?

304
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,175
What does that mean? Shit!

305
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:46,973
Do we try to lose them?
On this?

306
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:48,582
Yuri, we have to get off this thing.

307
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:50,183
No. No one's going anywhere.

308
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,980
Slow, dead slow. Buy me time.

309
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:57,084
Yeah, it's Yuri.

310
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:59,352
Get that fucking rag down!

311
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,188
I need another handle for this tub.

312
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,160
Something in our weight class.

313
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,591
You! Over the side.

314
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:07,667
We're changing the name. Now!

315
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:10,640
Yes, it's got to check out.

316
00:20:10,874 --> 00:20:11,863
The way I look at it,

317
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,336
what's in a name?

318
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,836
Have you got a shorter name?

319
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:18,104
I'd often changed the registration
of a ship or a plane...

320
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:20,475
...but never on such short notice.

321
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,285
Damn! They're hauling.

322
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,452
What? Kono? How do you spell
that?

323
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,354
K-O-N-O, okay, well, that's good.

324
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:34,530
Kono, K-O-N-O.

325
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,459
What are we flying? Dutch? Got it.

326
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,497
Vit, get me a Dutch flag, will you?

327
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:52,447
Faster! Or I'll send your ass in!

328
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:54,547
Yuri, I don't have Dutch!
What?

329
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:56,445
I've got Belgian.
What the fuck use is that?

330
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:57,516
He's painting a name registered

331
00:20:57,754 --> 00:20:59,483
in the fucking Netherlands.

332
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:03,051
I've got a French flag.
So?

333
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:04,760
Turn it sideways...

334
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:06,588
...it's Dutch.

335
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:09,565
That's why you're my brother.

336
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:33,186
All right, good!

337
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:35,391
Everybody look innocent now.

338
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:47,136
They say every man has his price.

339
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,894
But not every man gets it.

340
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:51,835
Interpol Agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought.

341
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,542
At least, not with money.

342
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:57,008
For Jack, glory was the prize.

343
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:59,875
Yeah, it's the Kono;
it's not the Kristol.

344
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:02,277
Kono, K-O-N-O.

345
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,781
It's clean, sir.

346
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,146
It's clean?

347
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:07,151
It sure doesn't look clean.

348
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,755
I'm going to go aboard.

349
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:11,654
Phone in a sighting of the
Kristol south of Aruba.

350
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,535
Even when I was up against an
overzealous agent...

351
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:25,070
...I had a number of methods for
discouraging a search.

352
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:27,276
I routinely mislabeled my arms shipments

353
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,909
"Farm Machinery."

354
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:31,613
And I have yet to meet the lowly
paid customs official...

355
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:32,837
...who will open a container...

356
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,846
...marked "Radioactive Waste"

357
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:37,110
to verify its contents.

358
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:39,413
But my personal favorite is
the unique combination...

359
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:43,251
of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.

360
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,034
Smells.

361
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:04,241
Sir, Sighting of the Kristol, due north.

362
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:07,480
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people

363
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,514
on the payroll to supply their colleagues

364
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:11,948
with counterintelligence.

365
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:13,212
Let's go.

366
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:26,930
The second rule of gunrunning is:

367
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,196
Always ensure you have a
foolproof way to get paid.

368
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,873
Preferably in advance...

369
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:34,008
ideally to an off-shore account.

370
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:36,769
That's why I chose my customers
so carefully.

371
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:39,447
Say what you like about warlords
and dictators...

372
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:42,173
they tend to have a highly
developed sense of order.

373
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,512
They always pay their bills on time.

374
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:46,244
What is this?

375
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,888
Six kilos of pure.

376
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:51,753
I can't hand this to my fucking bank

377
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:53,690
teller at Chase Manhattan.

378
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:58,163
Listen, asshole, you should be
thanking me.

379
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,767
Have you checked the street price today?

380
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:04,167
With the seizures at the border last week,

381
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:06,272
it's jumped thirty percent.

382
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:07,533
Whoa... whoa-whoa!

383
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:11,213
I sell guns. I don't sell drugs.

384
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:12,415
Diversify.

385
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:13,911
I've got standards.

386
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,641
You don't pay, you don't play.

387
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,114
Fuck you!

388
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:20,185
What are you doing?
Fuck you!

389
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:20,946
Fuck you!

390
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:22,658
No, you don't fuck him.

391
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:25,190
We can work something out.

392
00:24:26,896 --> 00:24:28,056
No, Vit!

393
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:30,266
We have a deal!

394
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:35,629
The first and most important
rule of gunrunning...

395
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:38,739
is never get shot with your own
merchandise.

396
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:40,870
Are you okay?

397
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:43,171
I think so.

398
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,607
So what do we do now?

399
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:47,910
Let's celebrate.

400
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:13,739
That narco guerilla had his facts right.

401
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:16,002
After shipping it stateside,
the return on that blow

402
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:18,146
netted me a healthy profit.

403
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:19,439
It would have been even better,

404
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:22,082
except one kilo never made it back.

405
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:23,285
Vitaly?

406
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:26,119
Vit!

407
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,288
To this day I don't know what Vitaly...

408
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:32,961
...was running away from.

409
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,959
Maybe just from Vitaly.

410
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,394
I found him twelve days,
two thousand miles,

411
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:39,897
and one hundred and fifty grams later

412
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:42,104
in a Bolivian boarding house.

413
00:25:46,142 --> 00:25:49,441
Of course, my dream girl
had gone there before me.

414
00:25:56,486 --> 00:25:57,578
Vit!

415
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:08,825
Come on!

416
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:26,545
Fuck, Yuri's back.

417
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:28,683
It's my brother, Yuri.

418
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:30,675
He's my big brother.

419
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,379
What the fuck is that?

420
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,921
Ukraine.

421
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,354
I was young, but I remember.

422
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:41,458
Look... I start in Odessa, right?

423
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:44,690
And then I work my way to the
Crimean

424
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:47,061
You'll be dead before you fucking
reach Kiev!

425
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:48,099
We're going home. Come on,

426
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:51,432
You fuck! You fucking fuck!

427
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:53,574
You fucking fuck...

428
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,937
What the fuck is your problem?

429
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:05,018
Come on, Vit.

430
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:06,050
J.F.K. Airport, New York - 1989

431
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,814
Yuri, it's so nice to be home.
Yeah, good work.

432
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,252
We're gonna get you home.

433
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:11,517
Come on.

434
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:16,726
St. Francis Rehabilitation Center

435
00:27:22,505 --> 00:27:24,097
Get out of the car.

436
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:31,146
Vitaly, I need you to get out of the car.

437
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:34,910
I promised our parents.

438
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,283
Please.

439
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,748
Vitaly, you're going to have a great time.

440
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:39,750
This is a top place.

441
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:41,752
Two Ford models checked in last week.

442
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,652
And that cute weather girl's been
here since July.

443
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:45,258
Please.

444
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,957
Please, Yuri.

445
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,083
You're a good brother.

446
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:12,515
You're a good brother, Yuri.

447
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:13,687
Okay. All right.

448
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:14,685
Good brother.

449
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:16,585
All right. Get out of the car.

450
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:17,884
Okay

451
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:20,720
Get out of the car.

452
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:29,971
From then on I was a one-man operation.

453
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:31,503
I never understood what separated...

454
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:34,505
the recreational drug user from
the habitual.

455
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:35,676
But for the grace of God...

456
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:37,106
it could've been me snorting lines

457
00:28:37,346 --> 00:28:39,371
as long as the Belt Parkway.

458
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,947
However, I wasn't entirely free

459
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:44,085
of the grip of addiction myself.

460
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,617
There she was again.

461
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:47,447
Ava Fontaine.

462
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,952
In my neighborhood they say,

463
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,454
"The good get out."

464
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:53,059
In our own ways, we'd both
conquered the world.

465
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:58,460
St. Barts, French Caribbean - 1989

466
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,443
You can't force somebody to
fall in love with you.

467
00:29:12,682 --> 00:29:14,877
But you can definitely improve your odds.

468
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:18,748
It cost me 20 grand to book he
for a fake photo shoot.

469
00:29:18,988 --> 00:29:21,286
Another twelve to buy out the hotel.

470
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:06,562
Popular hotel, huh?

471
00:30:10,473 --> 00:30:12,668
Ava Fontaine.
Yuri Orlov.

472
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:14,370
What brings you to St. Barts?

473
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,406
Photo shoot.

474
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:17,203
At least, that was the plan.

475
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:19,846
I guess the photographer got
stuck in Miami.

476
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:22,812
Hurricane. Though there's nothing
on the news.

477
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:26,855
Those things can come out of nowhere.

478
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:28,880
So... the job's been cancelled,

479
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:29,716
and wouldn't you know it,

480
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,154
there's no flight to New York until Tuesday.

481
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:33,487
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.

482
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:35,390
I'm leaving tomorrow.

483
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:39,658
Meanwhile, why don't I take your picture?

484
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,594
In my experience,

485
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:43,271
some of the most successful
relationships...

486
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:45,633
are based on lies and deceit.

487
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,604
Since that's where they usually
end up anyway...

488
00:30:47,844 --> 00:30:49,607
it's a logical place to start.

489
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:51,746
Right there. Hold it there.

490
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:53,710
Oh, my God!

491
00:30:57,086 --> 00:31:00,078
I nearly went broke trying to
convince her I was anything but.

492
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:03,457
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman

493
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:05,388
to be seduced by a ride in a private jet

494
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,289
unless you owned the jet.

495
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:09,225
This is your plane?

496
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:11,160
That is my name.

497
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,594
Of course, I was lying.

498
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:14,097
The plane was rented, like the car

499
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:16,305
and even the suit I was standing in

500
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:17,130
At the last minute,

501
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:19,432
I'd bribed the crew for the paint job.

502
00:31:19,675 --> 00:31:21,575
Luckily, by the time we landed...

503
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:24,575
Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.

504
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:27,674
I had no idea.

505
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:30,576
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

506
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,812
Don't apologize. I put clothes on
for a living.

507
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:35,455
A least you're not taking them off.

508
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:36,453
I would be, if half the...

509
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:38,523
...photographers had their way.

510
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:40,258
What about you?

511
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:41,793
I'm in transport.

512
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:44,056
International air freight, mostly.

513
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,131
Business is good.

514
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:48,596
Where're you from?

515
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,897
I was born in Ukraine,
but I grew up in Brooklyn.

516
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,799
No.

517
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:52,837
What, you too?

518
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:54,667
Williamsburg.

519
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:00,242
Here's to a hurricane.

520
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,582
Without it, I never would have met you.

521
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:07,287
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

522
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,989
It feels like fate.

523
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,328
I don't believe in fate.

524
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,500
What do you believe in?

525
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:03,005
Is that a view, or is that a view?

526
00:33:03,245 --> 00:33:04,872
That's a view.

527
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:18,325
Thank you. Thank you all.

528
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:23,165
Congratulations.

529
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,195
Congratulations.

530
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:25,400
Thanks.

531
00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:29,466
Always remember, son...

532
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,002
There is something above you.

533
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,332
Sure, Dad.

534
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:35,339
A forty-thousand-dollar crystal chandelier.

535
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,772
Make yourselves at home. Go!

536
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:42,143
Go!

537
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:59,358
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.

538
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:01,467
It'd be nice to have a couple
more guests

539
00:34:01,704 --> 00:34:03,365
from my side of the family.

540
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,870
I'm sure they're watching right now.

541
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:08,440
Thank you.

542
00:34:08,677 --> 00:34:10,542
But you don't believe that, Yuri...

543
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,407
...remember?

544
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,180
I know you, Yuri.

545
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,684
I know you're not everything you seem.

546
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:23,521
Don't worry, I won't ask a lot of questions.

547
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,522
I don't want to hear you lie.

548
00:34:26,729 --> 00:34:28,594
You take risks.

549
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:33,598
Just promise me you won't risk us.

550
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,601
That's the trouble with falling in love

551
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:36,862
with a dream girl.

552
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:39,404
They have a habit of becoming real.

553
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:47,545
I've never been so glad to see Vitaly.

554
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:49,546
You're fucking beautiful!

555
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:52,053
Brother...

556
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,346
Brother, thank you so much...

557
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:56,353
for giving me such a beautiful sister.

558
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:59,083
He was out of rehab, and out of his mind.

559
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:01,091
Dance! Dance! We have to dance!

560
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,059
All right, all right
It's a wedding, a celebration

561
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:03,697
To Yuri!

562
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,265
For once, he rescued me.

563
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,728
New York - December 25, 1991

564
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:11,736
I was still living way beyond my means.

565
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:15,432
Mortgaged to the hilt, using one
credit card to pay another.

566
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,077
Anything to keep Ava in the style to

567
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:19,577
which she had thanks largely to me

568
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:20,747
become accustomed.

569
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:22,041
Ava

570
00:35:22,284 --> 00:35:23,808
Ava, this is too much.

571
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:25,350
Yuri likes to spoil you.

572
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:26,213
Then suddenly,

573
00:35:26,455 --> 00:35:28,150
all my Christmases came at once.

574
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,120
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!

575
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:33,251
That's my grandson!

576
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:35,555
Yuri, don't you want to see what
your son is doing?

577
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:37,789
Whoever said it's better to give
than receive...

578
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:40,228
...never got a Christmas present
like the one I got...

579
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:43,336
in 1991 from Mikhail Gorbachev.

580
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:44,561
What the hell's the matter?

581
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:46,399
It's over!

582
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:47,165
What's over?

583
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:49,536
The Cold-fucking-War!
The Soviet-fucking Union

584
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:52,042
The Evil fucking-Empire!
Mikhail's saying no mas.

585
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:52,975
He's throwing in the towel.

586
00:35:53,215 --> 00:35:54,375
It's over!

587
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,651
Your son is walking.

588
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:01,413
That's incredible, honey.

589
00:36:07,029 --> 00:36:09,259
At least they'll get religious freedom.

590
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:10,891
Let's hope so.

591
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:13,758
I think I'll go back for a visit.

592
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:16,998
Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

593
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,233
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

594
00:36:24,446 --> 00:36:27,847
I don't think you're going to
Odessa to sell Pepsi-Cola.

595
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:34,212
Is this how you want to be remembered?

596
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:37,421
I don't want to be remembered at all.

597
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,026
I'm being remembered,
it means I'm dead.

598
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:43,724
Merry-fucking-Christmas!

599
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:46,433
Who is this, Vitaly?

600
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:47,494
I'm Angel.

601
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:50,227
Her name really is Angel.

602
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:52,630
She's a fairy.

603
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:57,737
Let's put her on top of the
Christmas tree.

604
00:36:58,047 --> 00:36:59,275
Come on

605
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,448
I love you.

606
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:06,382
Come on.

607
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:08,055
I love you all.

608
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:11,652
Take this.

609
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,302
I'm going back to Ukraine.

610
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:36,648
I miss Odessa.

611
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:47,095
I miss you.

612
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:48,353
I miss you.

613
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:54,536
Be careful, Yuri. Those things
you sell kill.

614
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:58,166
Inside.

615
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:02,206
You're high.

616
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:05,007
That's true.

617
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,815
Hello, Christian.

618
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:16,883
Odessa, Ukraine - 1992

619
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,887
During the Cold War, the Red
Army stationed nearly

620
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:21,596
one million troops in Ukraine...

621
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:25,095
because of its strategic military importance.

622
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,699
The day after The Wall came down...

623
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,459
the paychecks stopped coming.

624
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:30,228
Your papers.

625
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:31,905
There's nothing better for an arms dealer...

626
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:33,904
combination of disgruntled soldiers

627
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:36,771
and warehouses full of weapons.

628
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,307
Welcome.

629
00:38:39,715 --> 00:38:41,774
I was hoping Major General Dmitri Volkoff

630
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:43,541
would open a lot of armory doors

631
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:45,686
in a lot of military bases.

632
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,889
For a start, he was family.

633
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:50,353
He was a highly decorated hero
of the Red Army,

634
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:53,083
and he was almost permanently
shit-faced

635
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:56,992
I can't just sell you government
property, Yuri.

636
00:38:58,434 --> 00:38:59,901
I have to report.

637
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:03,127
Report to who? Moscow?

638
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,899
As of last week

639
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:07,802
Moscow's in a foreign country.

640
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,203
New flag, new boss.

641
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:11,208
There is no new boss yet.

642
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:13,074
They're all too busy squabbling over

643
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:15,476
who's gonna get the presidential
holiday home

644
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:17,015
at the Black Sea.

645
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:18,685
It's beautiful.

646
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:20,454
The ones who know don't care any more

647
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,486
and the ones who care don't know.

648
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,556
Show me your inventory.

649
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:41,675
Those 45 years of mutual hatred

650
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,968
between the East and the West...

651
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:44,645
had generated the highest weapons

652
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,438
buildup in history.

653
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:47,444
The Soviets had guns

654
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:49,116
coming out of the demon hole.

655
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:52,752
Huge stockpiles, and now no enemy.

656
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:56,319
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

657
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,422
Forty thousand.

658
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:01,986
Is that a four?

659
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,528
It doesn't look like a four to me.

660
00:40:03,766 --> 00:40:05,961
It's more like a one.

661
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:07,259
No, it's a four.

662
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:08,663
It's whatever we say it is.

663
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:11,236
Because no one else will know
the difference?

664
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:18,035
Ten thousand Kalashnikovs for
a Your stocks are battalion.

665
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,874
Your stocks are dangerously
depleted, Dmitri.

666
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:23,846
You should order more from the factory.

667
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:26,281
Someone will work it out.

668
00:40:27,423 --> 00:40:28,754
What happens then?

669
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,322
We'll cut them in.

670
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:34,260
The end of the Cold War

671
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:37,192
was the beginning of the hottest
time in arms dealing.

672
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,560
The arms bazaar was open.

673
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:42,328
Guided missiles, unguided missiles.

674
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:43,538
Mortars, mines,

675
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:45,364
armored personnel carriers.

676
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:47,234
Whole tank divisions.

677
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:48,902
I'll tell you what I'll do.

678
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:51,510
Buy six, you get one free.

679
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:55,881
I even landed a squadron of
helicopter gunships.

680
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,728
The most sophisticated fighting
machines...

681
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:13,730
built for a war with America that
never happened.

682
00:41:13,969 --> 00:41:16,870
Son, get off there before you get hurt.

683
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:19,369
I can take it apart with my eyes closed.

684
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:20,302
Thanks to me,

685
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,602
they'd finally get to fire a shot in anger.

686
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:32,880
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly

687
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:34,850
what Comrade Lenin had in mind

688
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,389
when he advocated the
redistribution of wealth.

689
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:39,559
But I wasn't the only one

690
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:42,593
offering a crash course in capitalism.

691
00:41:44,233 --> 00:41:46,133
I had rivals.

692
00:41:46,368 --> 00:41:47,494
Inform your commanding officer

693
00:41:47,736 --> 00:41:50,170
that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

694
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,835
You don't know who I am, do you?

695
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,136
I don't give a fuck who you are.

696
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:08,314
You're late.

697
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:11,218
So it appears.

698
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:25,065
Thank you.

699
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:26,974
My pleasure.

700
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:28,767
You sell guns?

701
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,077
Maybe you'd like to come to my room

702
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:36,307
and I'll show you my... cannon.

703
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:42,353
You look a little lost, Simeon.

704
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:44,650
Is the world changing too fast?

705
00:42:44,893 --> 00:42:46,292
I'm here, aren't I?

706
00:42:46,528 --> 00:42:47,961
Not all of you, I think.

707
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,426
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA

708
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,156
you can't seem to get that ideology

709
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:53,732
completely out of your head.

710
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,062
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

711
00:42:57,105 --> 00:42:59,096
Kept the tensions frozen.

712
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:02,167
Now it's harder to determine

713
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:03,673
which side one's on.

714
00:43:03,912 --> 00:43:05,675
Things have become more complicated.

715
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:07,905
No, it's gotten simpler.

716
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,210
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore,

717
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:13,751
I sell to leftists and rightists.

718
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:14,956
I sell to pacifists,

719
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,454
but they're not the most regular of
customers.

720
00:43:18,193 --> 00:43:19,683
Of course, you're not a true
internationalist...

721
00:43:19,928 --> 00:43:21,156
...until you've supplied weapons

722
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:23,330
to kill your own countrymen.

723
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:29,497
This current state of chaos won't
last forever.

724
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:31,863
There'll have to be order.

725
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:37,138
Instead of cutting each other's throats,

726
00:43:37,379 --> 00:43:38,869
it may be beneficial if we work together.

727
00:43:39,114 --> 00:43:40,513
What do you think?

728
00:43:43,385 --> 00:43:44,852
What do I think?

729
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:47,982
I think you are the amateur now,

730
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:50,524
and I think you should go with
your instincts.

731
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:52,750
With your first instinct.

732
00:43:52,995 --> 00:43:54,019
I'm the same man who was not

733
00:43:54,262 --> 00:43:55,593
good enough for you before...

734
00:43:55,831 --> 00:43:59,198
and I'm just not good enough
for you now.

735
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:16,815
The problem with gunrunners
going to war

736
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:20,387
is that there's no shortage of ammunition.

737
00:44:22,991 --> 00:44:24,015
This was the chaos

738
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:26,819
that the Old Guard had always feared.

739
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:28,051
As far as they were concerned,

740
00:44:28,296 --> 00:44:30,526
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

741
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:34,133
But they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.

742
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:37,997
And Ukraine wasn't the only former state...

743
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,300
with an unpaid army and stockpiles of guns.

744
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:46,139
There was Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Belarus...

745
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:48,508
all there for the taking.

746
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:55,251
Of all the weapons in the vast
Soviet arsenal...

747
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,789
nothing was more profitable than
Avtomat Kalashnikova,

748
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:00,619
model of 1947,

749
00:45:00,862 --> 00:45:04,923
more commonly known as the
AK-47... or kalashnikov.

750
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:07,829
It's the world's most popular
assault rifle

751
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,970
a weapon all fighters love.

752
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:11,536
An elegantly simple nine-pound

753
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:14,367
amalgamation of forged steel
and plywood.

754
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:17,169
It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.

755
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:18,936
It will shoot whether it's covered in mud

756
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:20,546
or filled with sand.

757
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:23,216
It's so easy, even a child can use it

758
00:45:23,452 --> 00:45:24,282
and they do.

759
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,316
The Soviets put the gun on a coin.

760
00:45:26,555 --> 00:45:28,853
Mozambique put it on their flag.

761
00:45:29,091 --> 00:45:30,285
Since the end of the Cold War,

762
00:45:30,525 --> 00:45:31,583
the Kalashnikov has become the...

763
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:34,125
...Russian people's greatest export.

764
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:36,159
After that comes vodka, caviar,

765
00:45:36,398 --> 00:45:38,127
and suicidal novelists.

766
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:40,093
One thing's for sure

767
00:45:40,335 --> 00:45:42,769
no one was lining up to buy their cars.

768
00:45:57,686 --> 00:45:59,950
What fucking documents?

769
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:06,586
You listen to me, Lieutenant.

770
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:09,058
You keep them there.
For as long as you can!

771
00:46:09,297 --> 00:46:10,821
Fight You listen to me, Lieutenant.

772
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:12,294
To the death! Moscow is behind us!

773
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:13,626
It's an order!

774
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,666
I thought you supposed watching
out for these people.

775
00:46:15,904 --> 00:46:17,269
How can I?

776
00:46:17,506 --> 00:46:19,133
You keep selling my helicopters.

777
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:21,035
You are too greedy, Yuri!

778
00:46:21,276 --> 00:46:23,107
I can't hold him forever.

779
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:24,334
I've got paperwork.

780
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,103
Not for the gunships.

781
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:27,440
You know the penalty for

782
00:46:27,682 --> 00:46:28,706
sanction-busting.

783
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,976
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

784
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,415
Military helicopter.

785
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:39,927
It's not a military helicopter.

786
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:42,130
It's a rescue helicopter.

787
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:44,158
Get to work, son.

788
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:45,792
No problem.

789
00:46:47,135 --> 00:46:48,762
The law's on our side.

790
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:10,084
All right, let me see your papers.

791
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:12,283
No-no-no, put that away.

792
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:13,824
See your papers.

793
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:15,154
Yuri Orlov.

794
00:47:15,597 --> 00:47:18,327
Mr. Orlov, always In the wrong
place at the right time.

795
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,364
What the fuck is this?

796
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:22,797
We've met before.

797
00:47:23,038 --> 00:47:24,835
Off the coast Colombia.

798
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:25,767
What was the name of that freighter?

799
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:29,465
I can't remember, was it the Kono
or the Kristol?

800
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:31,941
The crew called that vessel a lot of names.

801
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,841
None repeatable in polite company.

802
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:35,606
Answer the question.

803
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:37,580
The new MP-5.

804
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:39,646
Would you like a silencer for that?

805
00:47:39,888 --> 00:47:41,788
I need to see your papers.

806
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:43,982
Get the fuck off me.

807
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:45,386
Dmitri!

808
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:51,689
The end-user certificate for this aircraft...

809
00:47:51,933 --> 00:47:54,424
states "Burkina Faso."

810
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:56,330
Nice, very nice.

811
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:57,560
Did you type this up yourself?

812
00:47:57,806 --> 00:48:00,104
The helicopter is to be used on
humanitarian missions.

813
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:02,071
Oh, so you're a humanitarian?

814
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:03,641
Oh, absolutely.

815
00:48:04,546 --> 00:48:05,945
This is a military aircraft.

816
00:48:06,181 --> 00:48:07,978
Not anymore.
Listen to the nephew!

817
00:48:08,216 --> 00:48:09,649
What can they do with military hardware

818
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:11,750
but convert it to civilian use?

819
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:13,779
The only way you could die from this baby

820
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:16,149
now is if a food drop hits you.

821
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:19,985
And this stuff over here, huh?

822
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:21,752
Is it going to Burkina Faso... Ah,

823
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:24,090
but to a different client at a
different address.

824
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:25,663
That's just a coincidence is that it?

825
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:28,495
Do you take me for a complete
fucking fool?

826
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:29,999
Not complete, sir.

827
00:48:30,238 --> 00:48:32,069
And while I hesitate to tell your job.

828
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:34,571
I must point out that
when shipped separately,

829
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:35,571
the weapons and the aircraft

830
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,038
both comply with current Interpol

831
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:38,507
trade standards and practices.

832
00:48:38,747 --> 00:48:40,874
We both know, that is an obscene

833
00:48:41,116 --> 00:48:43,050
bureaucratic loophole that's gonna
be closed

834
00:48:43,285 --> 00:48:44,616
any goddamn day.

835
00:48:44,853 --> 00:48:46,445
But it's not closed.

836
00:48:46,755 --> 00:48:48,086
And while certain people might interpret

837
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:49,950
this cargo as suspicious,

838
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:51,783
thank God we live in a world,
where suspicion alone

839
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:53,722
does not constitute a crime.

840
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:54,951
And men like you

841
00:48:55,196 --> 00:48:56,823
respect the rule of law.

842
00:49:01,703 --> 00:49:02,863
I was as guilty as sin,

843
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:04,935
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

844
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:07,505
And he was the rarest breed of
law enforcement officer,

845
00:49:07,742 --> 00:49:09,300
the type who knew I was breaking the law,

846
00:49:09,544 --> 00:49:12,206
but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.

847
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:14,644
TWO DAYS LATER

848
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:17,513
Valentine wasn't the only one trying to

849
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:18,741
put me out of business.

850
00:49:18,987 --> 00:49:21,751
My uncle had turned down a half
dozen rival arms dealers,

851
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,322
sometimes with offers better than mine.

852
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,086
But to Dmitri, you couldn't put
a price on loyalty.

853
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:41,536
What was he doing here?

854
00:49:41,776 --> 00:49:43,607
He is hoping to beat your offer.

855
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:47,144
I told him to go have intercourse
with himself.

856
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:48,474
But Yuri

857
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:50,150
You need to make more payoffs.

858
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:51,750
Too many know.
Don't worry.

859
00:49:51,987 --> 00:49:53,454
There are more VCRs and cigarettes.

860
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:55,349
I left them in your new car.

861
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,657
Even your enemy was admiring that car.

862
00:50:02,797 --> 00:50:04,765
I'm the luckiest man alive.

863
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,989
You are.

864
00:50:45,073 --> 00:50:45,732
Hello.

865
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:46,599
Ava?

866
00:50:46,841 --> 00:50:48,103
Hi, baby.

867
00:50:49,711 --> 00:50:51,508
You forgot what time it is?

868
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:53,577
Sorry, I...

869
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:56,682
How was that your audition?

870
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,416
They're going in another direction.

871
00:50:59,654 --> 00:51:01,713
Direction with someone who can act.

872
00:51:01,956 --> 00:51:03,355
They don't deserve you.

873
00:51:05,326 --> 00:51:06,793
Where are you?

874
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:08,461
Is everything okay?

875
00:51:10,498 --> 00:51:12,523
It was a rough day at the office.

876
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,665
Come home.

877
00:51:13,902 --> 00:51:15,995
Soon. How's Nicki?

878
00:51:16,237 --> 00:51:19,035
He misses you. We both do.

879
00:51:19,874 --> 00:51:22,138
It's lonely without you here.

880
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,610
You know I don't like nights.

881
00:51:25,046 --> 00:51:27,071
Ever since my parents...

882
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:36,786
Yuri, what's that?

883
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:37,787
A party.

884
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:38,822
I'd better go.

885
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,857
Just wanted to call and hear your voice.

886
00:51:41,096 --> 00:51:41,858
Kiss Nicki for me.

887
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:43,359
I love you.

888
00:51:46,768 --> 00:51:49,134
The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

889
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:51,428
After The Wall came down

890
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:53,834
$32 billion billion dollars worth of arms

891
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:56,908
were stolen and resold from
Ukraine alone,

892
00:51:57,145 --> 00:52:00,478
one of the greatest heists of the
20th Century.

893
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:13,090
Monrovia, Liberia - 1995

894
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:16,056
The primary market was Africa.

895
00:52:16,297 --> 00:52:17,855
Eleven major conflicts involving

896
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:20,192
thirty-two countries in less than a decade...

897
00:52:20,435 --> 00:52:22,096
A gunrunner's wet dream.

898
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:24,305
At the time, the West couldn't care less.

899
00:52:24,539 --> 00:52:27,667
They had a white war in what was
left of Yugoslavia.

900
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:30,036
I did the bulk of my business in Liberia...

901
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:32,405
"Land of the Free." Originally

902
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:35,411
established as a homeland for
freed American slaves,

903
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,015
it's been enslaved by one dictator

904
00:52:37,252 --> 00:52:39,049
or another ever since.

905
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:40,652
The latest was American-educated,

906
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:43,915
self declared president, Andre Baptiste.

907
00:52:49,464 --> 00:52:50,590
Mr. Yuri!

908
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:55,031
I'm Andre Baptiste, Junior.

909
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:58,228
My father would like to meet you.

910
00:52:58,473 --> 00:53:00,600
What an honor.

911
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:01,206
Thank him.

912
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:03,569
But unfortunately I have other business.

913
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:06,780
It's a shame, it's a very busy schedule.

914
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:18,348
It is not, as they say, optional.

915
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:22,727
My father is easily offended.

916
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:25,894
My schedule just freed up.

917
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:30,237
President Baptiste was my best customer

918
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:32,268
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

919
00:53:32,507 --> 00:53:34,668
He'd gotten a reputation for
routinely hacking off the

920
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:36,877
limbs of those who opposed him.

921
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:39,511
His seven-year civil war has been
described...

922
00:53:39,747 --> 00:53:43,615
as "a relentless campaign of
sadistic wanton violence."

923
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:46,046
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

924
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,819
The Glock is interesting.

925
00:53:52,093 --> 00:53:53,890
It's made of a polymer composite.

926
00:53:54,128 --> 00:53:56,358
Many of my clients feel they can
get through airport security

927
00:53:56,598 --> 00:53:58,498
without setting off a lot of bells
and whistles.

928
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:00,564
Personally I do not recommend that.

929
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:01,200
On the other hand,

930
00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:04,872
if you are looking for a traditional
wheel gun,

931
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:06,596
there is no substitute for the six inches

932
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:08,832
of muzzle energy of a.357 magnum.

933
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:12,137
And of course, it will never jam.

934
00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:16,179
Why did you do that?

935
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,679
What did you say?

936
00:54:19,387 --> 00:54:21,218
Now you'll have to buy it.

937
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:22,423
It's a used gun.

938
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:26,150
How can I sell a used gun?

939
00:54:28,963 --> 00:54:30,089
A used gun.

940
00:54:31,499 --> 00:54:32,830
A used gun.

941
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:36,069
That's a good one.

942
00:54:38,806 --> 00:54:42,435
You know there is no discipline
with the youth today.

943
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:45,840
I try to set an example but it is
difficult, eh?

944
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:49,180
Personally, I blame MTV.

945
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:54,950
A used gun.

946
00:54:59,394 --> 00:55:03,956
I think you and I, we can do business.

947
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:07,663
If I thought I was scared of
Andre Senior,

948
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:10,166
I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.

949
00:55:10,705 --> 00:55:12,536
Like father, like son.

950
00:55:12,774 --> 00:55:15,675
The guava doesn't fall too far
from the tree.

951
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,434
He was also a cannibal.

952
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:19,169
They say Andre would eat a victim's heart

953
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:20,813
while it was still beating

954
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:22,880
to give him superhuman strength.

955
00:55:30,325 --> 00:55:33,761
Monrovia itself was like being on
another planet.

956
00:55:33,995 --> 00:55:35,656
Planet Monrovia.

957
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:36,454
From the temperature,

958
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:40,225
it was obviously a planet close to
the sun.

959
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:42,026
I rarely saw another white man,

960
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,931
and I never left town alone.

961
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:46,299
Outside town was the edge of hell.

962
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:48,475
I didn't want to even gaze into it.

963
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:53,170
This is your hotel. Two stars.

964
00:55:54,816 --> 00:55:56,681
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

965
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,783
Part one, two, or three?

966
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,146
I've only seen part one.

967
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:01,412
The M-60.

968
00:56:01,656 --> 00:56:03,453
Would you like the armor-piercing
bullets?

969
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:04,919
Please.

970
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,320
My father left a welcoming
present in your room.

971
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:11,297
Enjoy.

972
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:30,271
My God, she nearly got her head cut off.

973
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:32,482
When I get to America,

974
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:36,154
I will not live in Brentwood.

975
00:56:36,388 --> 00:56:37,582
Second floor.

976
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:45,185
In the most AIDS-infested region
of the globe...

977
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:47,399
where one in four is infected...

978
00:56:47,633 --> 00:56:49,225
Andre's idea of a joke was to put

979
00:56:49,468 --> 00:56:52,130
a young lman and a young Naomi
in my bed.

980
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:54,839
And no condom within 100 miles.

981
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:10,922
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

982
00:57:12,424 --> 00:57:13,618
Hi.

983
00:57:13,859 --> 00:57:16,350
We'd be happy to make you happy.

984
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:22,498
Uh, I can't. I'd love to.

985
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,065
But I can't.

986
00:57:24,303 --> 00:57:25,327
Don't worry.

987
00:57:25,938 --> 00:57:27,496
We don't have anything.

988
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:33,839
How do you know?

989
00:57:36,482 --> 00:57:38,313
Do we look like it?

990
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:40,177
What if I have AIDS?

991
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:41,750
Don't you worry?

992
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:44,584
You worry too much.

993
00:57:45,891 --> 00:57:47,119
Why do you worry about
something that

994
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,554
can kill you in ten years

995
00:57:49,895 --> 00:57:53,854
when there are so many things
that can kill you today?

996
00:57:56,301 --> 00:57:57,632
Now...

997
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:01,636
...how can we make you happy?

998
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:05,706
By leaving.

999
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:13,910
These are my Kalashnikov Kids.

1000
00:58:14,152 --> 00:58:16,052
My Boy Brigades.

1001
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:19,456
I can see what you are thinking,

1002
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,818
but we need every man we can get.

1003
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,925
Even if they're not men?

1004
00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:25,789
A bullet from a fourteen-year-old...

1005
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:29,728
...is just as effective as one from
a forty-year-old.

1006
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:31,731
Often more effective.

1007
00:58:35,107 --> 00:58:37,439
No one can stop this bath of blood.

1008
00:58:37,676 --> 00:58:38,506
It's not "bath of blood."

1009
00:58:38,744 --> 00:58:40,302
It's "bloodbath."

1010
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,708
Thank you.

1011
00:58:43,515 --> 00:58:45,346
But I prefer it my way.

1012
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:00,328
I am not going to pay your asking price.

1013
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:02,466
We are not a rich people.
And besides,

1014
00:59:02,701 --> 00:59:05,864
the market is already flooded with
your Kalashnikovs.

1015
00:59:06,104 --> 00:59:07,731
Do you realize in some parts of
my country

1016
00:59:07,973 --> 00:59:09,838
you can get one for the price of a chicken?

1017
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:11,633
But you can't just consider unit price.

1018
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:13,208
You forget ancillary costs.

1019
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:15,572
End-user certificates need to be
forged and notarized,

1020
00:59:15,814 --> 00:59:16,746
Shell companies set up,

1021
00:59:16,982 --> 00:59:18,973
insurance purchased,
pilots and crews hired.

1022
00:59:19,217 --> 00:59:20,912
Not to mention bribes.

1023
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:22,153
You can't get a nut and bolt out

1024
00:59:22,387 --> 00:59:24,048
of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.

1025
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:25,483
There's one bribe for the nut,

1026
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:27,157
another for the bolt.

1027
00:59:27,392 --> 00:59:28,359
Andy... Andy, listen to me.

1028
00:59:28,594 --> 00:59:30,994
This is an expensive proposition.

1029
00:59:31,229 --> 00:59:32,389
"Andy"?

1030
00:59:34,132 --> 00:59:40,935
I am going to pay you in timber or stones.

1031
00:59:44,076 --> 00:59:45,065
I'll take the stones.

1032
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:49,542
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk
into my hand luggage.

1033
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:51,976
I know you're planning a new offensive.

1034
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:53,650
If you can delay a week,

1035
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:56,183
I can get you armored personnel carriers.

1036
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:58,912
They'd greatly reduce your casualties...

1037
00:59:59,157 --> 01:00:02,149
...and give you a significant
strategic advantage.

1038
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:06,395
You know, they call me
the Lord Of War.

1039
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:08,828
But perhaps it is you.

1040
01:00:09,434 --> 01:00:12,961
It's not "Lord Of War," it's "Warlord."

1041
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:16,739
Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

1042
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:23,575
Conflict diamonds are a common
currency in West Africa,

1043
01:00:23,815 --> 01:00:25,680
also referred to as "blood diamonds"

1044
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:29,080
since bloodshed is what they
generally finance.

1045
01:00:30,055 --> 01:00:31,682
By the late '90s, my wealth had caught up

1046
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:33,584
to my lies about my welth.

1047
01:00:33,825 --> 01:00:35,793
Even surpassed my lies.

1048
01:00:36,028 --> 01:00:39,259
I could even afford to become a
patron of the arts.

1049
01:00:47,673 --> 01:00:49,868
It's just that I can't believe it.

1050
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:51,871
Well, of... of course, it's wonderful.

1051
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:52,906
I just...

1052
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:55,943
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

1053
01:00:56,948 --> 01:01:00,816
Yes. Well, that wou-that would be
great, too yeah.

1054
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:05,015
It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

1055
01:01:05,257 --> 01:01:08,283
It's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.

1056
01:01:08,527 --> 01:01:09,960
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.

1057
01:01:10,195 --> 01:01:11,287
I just sold my first painting.

1058
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,725
Aah! That's fantastic.

1059
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,032
Uh, who bought it?

1060
01:01:16,268 --> 01:01:17,428
It's someone important.

1061
01:01:17,669 --> 01:01:19,193
They want to remain anonymous.

1062
01:01:19,438 --> 01:01:21,565
This is so wonderful!
How was your trip?

1063
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:22,831
You know, same old, same old.

1064
01:01:23,075 --> 01:01:23,734
Where's Nicki?

1065
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:26,500
Oh, in bed, I'm sorry.
He couldn't stay up.

1066
01:01:26,745 --> 01:01:27,336
That's best.

1067
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:28,944
My first painting!

1068
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:31,012
I'm officially an artist!

1069
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,217
This calls for a drink.
What doesn't?

1070
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,551
Hi.

1071
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:38,619
Yuri, this is uh...

1072
01:01:38,857 --> 01:01:39,755
Candy.

1073
01:01:39,991 --> 01:01:41,982
Candy. Of course.

1074
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:45,292
Any friend of my brother's is a...

1075
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,895
friend of my brother's.

1076
01:01:47,132 --> 01:01:50,465
You have a beautiful... everything.

1077
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:53,126
Yes, he does.

1078
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:54,565
Yes, I do.

1079
01:01:54,806 --> 01:01:55,704
I'm going to kiss Nicki goodnight.

1080
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:57,033
Okay.

1081
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:53,725
How are you, brother?

1082
01:02:53,965 --> 01:02:55,330
Well, you know,

1083
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,933
still the resident family fuckup.

1084
01:02:58,436 --> 01:03:01,928
Yeah. Well, I guess someone has
to do it.

1085
01:03:02,174 --> 01:03:03,163
Well.

1086
01:03:04,442 --> 01:03:07,843
Hey, Ava knows, right?

1087
01:03:13,018 --> 01:03:15,452
I never want to say anything,

1088
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:16,312
She doesn't have to know.

1089
01:03:16,555 --> 01:03:17,852
She understands.

1090
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:20,182
She's a survivor, like me.

1091
01:03:21,226 --> 01:03:22,352
She may be a survivor,

1092
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:24,186
but she's not like you.

1093
01:03:27,465 --> 01:03:29,399
Really She doesn't know
how you pay for all this

1094
01:03:29,634 --> 01:03:31,534
We don't talk about it.

1095
01:03:32,137 --> 01:03:35,334
How many car salesman talk
about their work? Huh?

1096
01:03:35,574 --> 01:03:36,472
How many cigarette salesmen?

1097
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,107
Both their products kill more people

1098
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:38,968
every year than mine.

1099
01:03:39,211 --> 01:03:42,442
At least mine has a safety switch.

1100
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,375
If those guys can leave their work
at the office,

1101
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:47,016
so can I.

1102
01:03:48,353 --> 01:03:51,447
God damn, you are good!

1103
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:54,624
You really are.

1104
01:03:56,094 --> 01:03:58,119
You almost had me convinced.

1105
01:04:08,673 --> 01:04:10,265
Could you...

1106
01:04:12,878 --> 01:04:14,641
could you help me out with...

1107
01:04:21,353 --> 01:04:22,479
Why?

1108
01:04:24,623 --> 01:04:25,612
Why?

1109
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:28,351
Why?

1110
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:31,292
Why what?

1111
01:04:31,529 --> 01:04:32,359
Why?

1112
01:04:32,597 --> 01:04:33,222
Why?
I don't know.

1113
01:04:33,465 --> 01:04:34,727
Why...
I don't know.

1114
01:04:34,966 --> 01:04:36,058
Why what?

1115
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:39,968
Why're you so fucked up all the time?

1116
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:47,841
Because I am. I don't know.

1117
01:04:57,923 --> 01:04:59,550
I didn't know how much Ava
really knew...

1118
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:01,952
and how much she ignored.

1119
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:03,319
She never questioned how a guy

1120
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:04,585
in the transport business...

1121
01:05:04,829 --> 01:05:08,026
could afford to give her 18 carat
diamond earrings.

1122
01:05:08,266 --> 01:05:11,326
I guess she didn't want to hear the answer.

1123
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:12,729
Mostly, She seemed content

1124
01:05:12,971 --> 01:05:14,268
that I was a good provider...

1125
01:05:14,506 --> 01:05:17,475
and as far as she was concerned, loyal.

1126
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:18,733
Despite the other women...

1127
01:05:18,977 --> 01:05:20,308
I always made love to Ava

1128
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:22,513
as if she was the only one.

1129
01:05:26,251 --> 01:05:28,014
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.

1130
01:05:28,253 --> 01:05:30,244
It's not called gunrunning for nothing.

1131
01:05:30,488 --> 01:05:31,978
You gotta be fast on your feet.

1132
01:05:32,223 --> 01:05:35,351
Some revolutions blow over
the guns even get there.

1133
01:05:35,593 --> 01:05:36,582
There's nothing's more expensive

1134
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:38,420
for an arms dealer than peace.

1135
01:05:38,663 --> 01:05:40,756
Truce? What do you mean, truce?

1136
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:42,762
The guns are already on their way.

1137
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:45,696
Peace talks.

1138
01:05:46,871 --> 01:05:47,633
All right, forget it.

1139
01:05:47,872 --> 01:05:49,032
I'll re-route the shipment to the Balkans.

1140
01:05:49,274 --> 01:05:50,571
When they talk about war,

1141
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:52,367
they keep their word.

1142
01:05:59,884 --> 01:06:01,613
Of course, a new breed of gunrunner

1143
01:06:01,853 --> 01:06:03,980
requires a new breed of cop.

1144
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,691
Henry, take Park Avenue.

1145
01:06:29,047 --> 01:06:30,844
Take 'em on a tour of New Jersey.

1146
01:07:05,483 --> 01:07:10,716
Yuri, there are men going through
our garbage cans.

1147
01:07:10,955 --> 01:07:12,217
Well, it's probably just some reporters

1148
01:07:12,457 --> 01:07:13,822
looking for somebody else.

1149
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:17,495
I have a feeling they don't work
for the tabloids.

1150
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:19,758
Yuri...

1151
01:07:21,699 --> 01:07:24,463
is there anything I should be
worried about?

1152
01:07:25,537 --> 01:07:26,902
No, nothing.

1153
01:07:27,138 --> 01:07:28,264
Nothing?

1154
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:29,564
I love you.

1155
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,107
I love you, too.

1156
01:07:36,781 --> 01:07:37,873
Sir.

1157
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:28,161
I was now the best merchant
of death alive.

1158
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,959
I didn't own my own plane,
I owned a fleet.

1159
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:32,999
Running guns into Liberia,
Sierra Leone,

1160
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,729
or the lvory Coast at least once a week.

1161
01:08:35,974 --> 01:08:38,238
Most trips I had phony paperwork.

1162
01:08:38,476 --> 01:08:39,340
The deadline was tight

1163
01:08:39,577 --> 01:08:40,669
and I had to cut corners,

1164
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:43,142
I had no paperwork at all.

1165
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,942
But I wasn't overly concerned.

1166
01:08:47,185 --> 01:08:49,244
There was hardly any radar over
most of Africa

1167
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:51,421
and even fewer people to watch it.

1168
01:08:56,828 --> 01:08:58,523
Charlie Echo India,
C-E-I...

1169
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:00,355
...re-route to Kabala airport...

1170
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:02,498
...on heading zero-two nine.

1171
01:09:02,734 --> 01:09:04,258
Comply immediately.

1172
01:09:04,502 --> 01:09:06,265
Yuri, what the fuck is going on?

1173
01:09:17,982 --> 01:09:19,142
Hello, Southern? It's Yuri.

1174
01:09:19,384 --> 01:09:20,316
I Sorry to call you on this number.

1175
01:09:20,552 --> 01:09:22,179
But I've got Interpol's all over my ass.

1176
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,785
I can't know you right now.

1177
01:09:24,022 --> 01:09:26,183
It's uh, not a good time.

1178
01:09:28,092 --> 01:09:29,286
Not a good time?

1179
01:09:33,097 --> 01:09:34,155
Motherfucker!

1180
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:41,231
Charlie, Echo, India,
comply immediately.

1181
01:09:41,472 --> 01:09:42,871
This is your last warning.

1182
01:09:43,107 --> 01:09:44,131
Where was the first fucking warning?

1183
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,138
Rock your wings
if you intend to comply

1184
01:09:46,377 --> 01:09:47,639
I'm putting us down.

1185
01:09:52,951 --> 01:09:54,145
If you land, we're going away.

1186
01:09:54,385 --> 01:09:55,181
I don't have paperwork.

1187
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,444
We're in a flying fucking bomb!

1188
01:09:56,688 --> 01:09:58,246
They're firing bullets at our bullets.

1189
01:09:58,489 --> 01:09:59,854
I'm putting us down.

1190
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:02,321
Okay, okay. Fuck!

1191
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:04,289
This is Charlie, Echo, India.

1192
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:06,463
Request re-route to Kabala airport,

1193
01:10:06,698 --> 01:10:08,393
bearing zero-two-nine.

1194
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:11,227
No, not the airport. There the highway.

1195
01:10:11,469 --> 01:10:12,458
It's our only hope.

1196
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:14,035
Are you fucking mad?

1197
01:10:14,272 --> 01:10:15,933
A pothole will set us off.

1198
01:10:16,274 --> 01:10:17,935
You underestimate yourself, Alexei.

1199
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:18,938
You're the best.

1200
01:10:19,177 --> 01:10:20,542
You're the shit, Alexei, you're the shit!

1201
01:10:20,778 --> 01:10:22,746
You're the shit! You're the shit!

1202
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:25,610
Of course Alexei wasn't the best.

1203
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,374
He'd come forty-second out of
forty three

1204
01:10:27,619 --> 01:10:29,917
at the Moscow Flight School.

1205
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:39,091
Oh, God, what's he doing?

1206
01:10:39,964 --> 01:10:41,591
Is this guy nuts?

1207
01:10:43,401 --> 01:10:44,629
I can't land there, sir.

1208
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:46,302
Kabala's fifteen minutes away.

1209
01:10:46,537 --> 01:10:47,595
He can't get far.

1210
01:10:47,839 --> 01:10:50,307
I want a truck on the tarmac.

1211
01:12:06,551 --> 01:12:07,882
We gonna be okay.

1212
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:11,245
Where are you going?

1213
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:13,218
As far from the evidence as we can get.

1214
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:16,325
Wait, there's not going to be any evidence!

1215
01:12:31,442 --> 01:12:32,773
Come here. Come here.

1216
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:38,073
Hey, don't be shy. Here, look.

1217
01:12:38,316 --> 01:12:38,975
Free sample

1218
01:12:39,217 --> 01:12:40,684
help yourself, okay? Free sample.

1219
01:12:40,918 --> 01:12:42,044
Tell yourt friend.

1220
01:12:44,956 --> 01:12:46,116
Gun for you.

1221
01:12:46,357 --> 01:12:47,346
Happy times. Come on.

1222
01:12:47,592 --> 01:12:48,923
Help yourselves. No charge.

1223
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,218
Everything goes.

1224
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:53,362
Guns, guns, guns, yes,
come on up!

1225
01:12:53,598 --> 01:12:55,725
Here! You're having fun now, huh?

1226
01:12:57,435 --> 01:13:00,962
Come on! Guns, guns, guns! Yes!

1227
01:13:01,205 --> 01:13:04,766
Bullets, guns, grenades!

1228
01:13:05,009 --> 01:13:05,907
Take 'em all.

1229
01:13:06,144 --> 01:13:07,839
Take the whole crate. Go ahead.

1230
01:13:11,716 --> 01:13:14,116
Gun, grenades, hooray!

1231
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:17,378
Bullets! Guns! Grenades!

1232
01:13:18,322 --> 01:13:19,220
Yeah.

1233
01:13:19,657 --> 01:13:20,681
That one's got your name on it.

1234
01:13:20,925 --> 01:13:22,392
You want one, too? Come on.

1235
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:23,992
Don't forget the bullets.

1236
01:13:24,228 --> 01:13:25,354
Don't forget the bullets.

1237
01:13:25,596 --> 01:13:27,860
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

1238
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:30,329
Everything goes for free!

1239
01:13:30,568 --> 01:13:33,969
Guns, grenades! All you see. Bullets,

1240
01:13:34,205 --> 01:13:35,934
guns, grenades.

1241
01:13:36,174 --> 01:13:38,699
Hooray, hooray!

1242
01:13:39,477 --> 01:13:40,910
Have the bullets.

1243
01:13:41,145 --> 01:13:42,908
What a cargo crew at Heathrow Airport

1244
01:13:43,147 --> 01:13:45,047
does in a day took a bunch of

1245
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:48,684
malnourished Sierra Leonean
locals ten minutes.

1246
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,620
By the time Agent Valentine got there,

1247
01:13:51,856 --> 01:13:54,882
you could find more guns on
a plane full of Quakers.

1248
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:03,531
Yuri Orlov.

1249
01:14:04,101 --> 01:14:05,625
Ow! Fuck!

1250
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:07,030
You run from us?

1251
01:14:07,405 --> 01:14:08,872
No, Mbizi. No!

1252
01:14:09,106 --> 01:14:10,630
Can you run with no legs?

1253
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:13,076
Let me make him disappear,
Mr Valentine

1254
01:14:13,311 --> 01:14:15,006
Around here, people disappear all the time.

1255
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:16,213
I can't do that.

1256
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,813
Look where we are. Who will know?

1257
01:14:21,552 --> 01:14:22,610
We will.

1258
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,187
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

1259
01:14:31,696 --> 01:14:33,061
I'm not as certain.

1260
01:14:41,739 --> 01:14:42,899
All right, get up.

1261
01:14:47,478 --> 01:14:48,172
What's the charge?

1262
01:14:48,412 --> 01:14:50,312
What are you doing in Sierra Leone...

1263
01:14:50,848 --> 01:14:51,872
I'm on safari.

1264
01:14:52,116 --> 01:14:55,279
Yeah? You're hunting wildebeests

1265
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,509
with a submachine gun?

1266
01:14:56,754 --> 01:14:58,483
Do you also work with the
Park Service?

1267
01:14:58,723 --> 01:15:00,691
Hunting without a license,
is that the charge?

1268
01:15:00,925 --> 01:15:02,756
Why are we playing games?

1269
01:15:02,994 --> 01:15:04,359
You traffic arms.

1270
01:15:04,595 --> 01:15:04,959
Trade.

1271
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:05,685
Trade.

1272
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:07,227
Traffic.

1273
01:15:07,465 --> 01:15:11,060
You get rich by giving the
poorest people on the planet

1274
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:12,826
the means to continue killing each other.

1275
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,697
Do you know why I do what I do?

1276
01:15:14,939 --> 01:15:17,703
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

1277
01:15:17,942 --> 01:15:19,534
Keeping track of nuclear arsenals,

1278
01:15:19,777 --> 01:15:21,802
You'd think that's more critical to
world security,

1279
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:22,774
but it's not.

1280
01:15:23,014 --> 01:15:24,948
No, nine out of ten war victims today

1281
01:15:25,182 --> 01:15:28,674
are killed with assault rifles and
small like yours.

1282
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,682
Those nuclear missiles?

1283
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:32,412
They sit in their silos. Your AK-47?

1284
01:15:32,657 --> 01:15:35,455
That is the real weapon of mass
destruction.

1285
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,420
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.

1286
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:39,789
I don't put a gun to anybody's head

1287
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:41,555
and make them shoot.

1288
01:15:41,799 --> 01:15:44,165
I admit, but shooting war is better
for business,

1289
01:15:44,402 --> 01:15:46,802
but I prefer people to
fire my guns and miss.

1290
01:15:47,038 --> 01:15:48,596
Just as long as they're firing.

1291
01:15:58,049 --> 01:15:59,539
Can I go now?

1292
01:15:59,784 --> 01:16:02,947
You've got nothing on me.
Except cuffs.

1293
01:16:06,591 --> 01:16:08,456
Since you're so concerned with the law,

1294
01:16:08,693 --> 01:16:10,058
you must know that I'm legally

1295
01:16:10,294 --> 01:16:12,194
permitted to hold you for
twenty- four hours

1296
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,727
without charging you.

1297
01:16:14,432 --> 01:16:16,957
You might ask why I would do
that and I can assure you.

1298
01:16:17,201 --> 01:16:18,463
It's not because I enjoy your
company,

1299
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:20,034
because I don't.

1300
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:21,160
No, the reason why

1301
01:16:21,405 --> 01:16:23,202
I'll delay you for every second

1302
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:25,272
of the permissible twenty-four hours

1303
01:16:25,509 --> 01:16:27,739
Is I'm delaying your deadly trade

1304
01:16:27,979 --> 01:16:29,640
and the deaths of your victims.

1305
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,541
I don't think of it as taking a day from you...

1306
01:16:31,782 --> 01:16:33,511
...but giving a day to them.

1307
01:16:33,751 --> 01:16:35,776
Some innocent man, woman, or child

1308
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:36,952
is going to have an extra day

1309
01:16:37,188 --> 01:16:40,316
on this earth because you're not free.

1310
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:46,889
So, I will see you in twenty-three hours

1311
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:48,826
and fifty-five minutes, hm?

1312
01:16:54,405 --> 01:16:56,566
Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.

1313
01:16:56,807 --> 01:16:58,399
There was nowhere to go.

1314
01:16:59,243 --> 01:17:00,505
Or maybe he was hoping the locals

1315
01:17:00,745 --> 01:17:02,542
would tear me apart.

1316
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,340
But they were too busy with the plane.

1317
01:17:07,718 --> 01:17:08,616
It's like parking your car

1318
01:17:08,853 --> 01:17:11,447
in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.

1319
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:13,350
You just don't do it.

1320
01:17:24,802 --> 01:17:25,769
The way I looked at it

1321
01:17:26,003 --> 01:17:29,439
it's the way of Africa, maybe life.

1322
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:31,306
Everything that comes from the earth

1323
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,339
eventually returns.

1324
01:17:33,778 --> 01:17:37,179
Even a 40-ton Atonov-12 cargo plane.

1325
01:18:34,371 --> 01:18:37,306
A gift. For you.

1326
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:41,876
You know, you've arrived just in time.

1327
01:18:42,113 --> 01:18:44,104
I was afraid that he might die

1328
01:18:44,348 --> 01:18:47,943
before you got your chance to kill him.

1329
01:18:53,958 --> 01:19:00,193
This man came here hoping to
take your place.

1330
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,490
Is that not so?

1331
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:19,177
No, I'm not here to supply
Mr. Baptiste.

1332
01:19:20,251 --> 01:19:23,948
I am here to supply his enemies.

1333
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:29,750
I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.

1334
01:19:32,496 --> 01:19:36,626
He killed your blood... Your uncle...

1335
01:19:37,535 --> 01:19:39,799
when he tried to kill you.

1336
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,912
No.

1337
01:19:50,147 --> 01:19:51,307
No?

1338
01:19:53,818 --> 01:19:56,048
You want that I should let him go?

1339
01:19:58,289 --> 01:20:02,055
"No. I..."

1340
01:20:04,528 --> 01:20:06,291
You do want him dead.

1341
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,556
You just... don't want

1342
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,098
to have to do it yourself.

1343
01:20:17,308 --> 01:20:18,468
So.

1344
01:20:19,877 --> 01:20:21,640
We will do this together.

1345
01:20:26,317 --> 01:20:33,052
This will be a bonding experience.

1346
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:41,592
You know you can stop this
any time that you want.

1347
01:20:41,832 --> 01:20:43,891
But I don't think that you do.

1348
01:20:44,134 --> 01:20:45,567
Just say the word.

1349
01:20:46,937 --> 01:20:50,065
Say it. "Stop."

1350
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:05,211
Stop.

1351
01:21:14,865 --> 01:21:16,958
I will get you another room,
my friend.

1352
01:21:18,235 --> 01:21:20,567
With a much nicer view.

1353
01:21:53,337 --> 01:21:55,601
He ordered you brown-brown,
Mr. Yuri.

1354
01:21:59,576 --> 01:22:00,736
What?

1355
01:22:00,978 --> 01:22:01,603
Brown-brown.

1356
01:22:01,845 --> 01:22:03,073
What is it?

1357
01:22:03,314 --> 01:22:05,373
A mixture of cocaine...

1358
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:07,975
...and gunpowder.

1359
01:22:08,919 --> 01:22:10,910
They give it to the young boys
before they do battle.

1360
01:22:11,155 --> 01:22:12,713
They'll do anything!

1361
01:22:14,558 --> 01:22:16,219
Some other time.

1362
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:20,590
I suggest you try it,
at least once, Mr. Yuri.

1363
01:22:20,831 --> 01:22:22,162
Why?

1364
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:25,391
'Cause it's your gunpowder.

1365
01:22:47,391 --> 01:22:48,653
Even before that night,

1366
01:22:48,892 --> 01:22:51,952
I'd started doing a lot of cocaine
in West Africa.

1367
01:22:52,196 --> 01:22:54,494
I'd never tried brown-brown before,

1368
01:22:54,732 --> 01:22:57,064
but then I'd never killed a man, either.

1369
01:23:14,752 --> 01:23:16,151
Oh.

1370
01:23:22,026 --> 01:23:24,586
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

1371
01:23:25,596 --> 01:23:27,359
I didn't do anything, did I?

1372
01:23:27,598 --> 01:23:29,498
You didn't do much.

1373
01:23:31,502 --> 01:23:33,265
Wait. Are you sick?

1374
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,371
SIDA? AIDS?

1375
01:23:37,975 --> 01:23:41,138
Ask the white man. He will know.

1376
01:23:41,378 --> 01:23:44,040
Sir, will my hand grow back?

1377
01:23:52,523 --> 01:23:53,455
Simeon.

1378
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:56,887
Remember, Yuri, take sides.

1379
01:24:00,531 --> 01:24:01,896
Simeon!

1380
01:24:05,035 --> 01:24:08,163
Don't! He's Andre's.
Fuck Andre!

1381
01:24:08,405 --> 01:24:09,963
Fuck Andre!

1382
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:15,140
I'm sorry they don't usually do that.

1383
01:24:17,848 --> 01:24:19,372
Let me look it. Maybe I can fix it.

1384
01:24:19,616 --> 01:24:20,913
Let me see it. It's the magazine.

1385
01:24:21,151 --> 01:24:22,448
Give it to me.

1386
01:24:24,321 --> 01:24:25,549
Fuck you!

1387
01:24:51,582 --> 01:24:53,777
I started to feel I'd been cursed.

1388
01:24:54,384 --> 01:24:56,511
...the curse of invincibility.

1389
01:25:00,858 --> 01:25:02,758
Nicki, please, go to your room.

1390
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,259
I don't believe you.

1391
01:25:09,233 --> 01:25:10,825
Can you prove any of this?

1392
01:25:12,169 --> 01:25:14,694
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble

1393
01:25:14,938 --> 01:25:16,963
to make his business look legitimate.

1394
01:25:17,207 --> 01:25:18,265
Even to you.

1395
01:25:18,509 --> 01:25:21,000
Perhaps especially to you.

1396
01:25:21,245 --> 01:25:23,941
I don't expect we'll find anything here today.

1397
01:25:24,181 --> 01:25:25,705
So what do you want?

1398
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:30,411
I was hoping that you would help me.

1399
01:25:37,227 --> 01:25:39,957
I understand that uh...

1400
01:25:40,197 --> 01:25:42,961
your parents died tragically?

1401
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:50,130
The illegal firearms used to murder
your mother and father

1402
01:25:50,374 --> 01:25:53,741
were procured from men exactly
like your husband.

1403
01:25:55,979 --> 01:25:57,674
I'd like you to leave.

1404
01:26:01,185 --> 01:26:03,153
Okay. Gentlemen.

1405
01:26:18,535 --> 01:26:19,968
Ava?

1406
01:26:29,313 --> 01:26:30,837
Ava, what's wrong?

1407
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:34,117
I can't wear the clothes.

1408
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:36,816
Can't wear the jewelry.

1409
01:26:38,488 --> 01:26:40,388
Can't drive the car.

1410
01:26:42,759 --> 01:26:44,727
Can't live in this house.

1411
01:26:44,962 --> 01:26:46,691
Everything's got blood on it.

1412
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,454
Blood on it?

1413
01:26:50,634 --> 01:26:52,431
What's the matter with you?

1414
01:26:56,373 --> 01:26:58,170
Don't be so melodramatic.

1415
01:26:58,408 --> 01:26:59,432
I'm melodramatic.

1416
01:26:59,676 --> 01:27:01,837
I'm a failed actress, remember?

1417
01:27:10,787 --> 01:27:13,347
I told you, these people, it's political.

1418
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:15,455
They lie. They're liars.

1419
01:27:15,692 --> 01:27:17,284
Look at me. They lie to make

1420
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:18,516
themselves look good, okay?

1421
01:27:18,762 --> 01:27:20,457
You can't trust them.

1422
01:27:20,697 --> 01:27:22,460
It's not just them.

1423
01:27:25,335 --> 01:27:28,600
Don't worry. Your family didn't
say anything.

1424
01:27:28,839 --> 01:27:30,466
They didn't have to.

1425
01:27:32,609 --> 01:27:36,909
I sell people a means to defend
themselves. Ava.

1426
01:27:37,147 --> 01:27:37,943
That's all.

1427
01:27:38,181 --> 01:27:42,083
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.

1428
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:43,286
The guns are bigger than the boys!

1429
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,011
There is nothing illegal
about what I do!

1430
01:27:46,256 --> 01:27:48,724
I don't care if it's legal!

1431
01:27:48,959 --> 01:27:50,392
It's wrong!

1432
01:28:09,946 --> 01:28:12,107
Please, stop.

1433
01:28:15,085 --> 01:28:17,883
It makes no difference if I stop.

1434
01:28:18,121 --> 01:28:19,918
Someone will take my place the next day.

1435
01:28:20,157 --> 01:28:23,558
So let them. We have enough.

1436
01:28:24,728 --> 01:28:26,787
It's not about the money.

1437
01:28:28,365 --> 01:28:30,162
Then what is it?

1438
01:28:34,338 --> 01:28:35,896
I'm good at it.

1439
01:28:46,383 --> 01:28:50,251
I feel like all I've done my whole life
is be pretty.

1440
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:55,288
I mean all I've done is be born.

1441
01:28:56,059 --> 01:29:00,393
I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.

1442
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,393
I'm not much good as a mother.

1443
01:29:05,235 --> 01:29:08,170
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

1444
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:15,471
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1445
01:29:17,114 --> 01:29:20,481
But I won't fail as a human being.

1446
01:29:24,521 --> 01:29:25,988
My enemies had finally found a weapon

1447
01:29:26,223 --> 01:29:27,815
that could hurt me.

1448
01:29:29,559 --> 01:29:30,355
For the next six months,

1449
01:29:30,594 --> 01:29:31,788
I stopped running guns.

1450
01:29:32,028 --> 01:29:32,756
I went legitimate.

1451
01:29:32,996 --> 01:29:34,520
This is an untapped market.

1452
01:29:34,765 --> 01:29:37,233
I'm talking over five million
cubic meters of timber

1453
01:29:37,467 --> 01:29:38,491
in the first year alone.

1454
01:29:38,735 --> 01:29:40,828
Over 100 exploitable species.

1455
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:41,935
The oil?

1456
01:29:42,172 --> 01:29:44,231
Between you and me, this...

1457
01:29:44,474 --> 01:29:46,465
Ten thousand barrels a month?

1458
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:50,339
He must be lying. He's talking!

1459
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,569
Listen, there are gas reserves off the

1460
01:29:51,815 --> 01:29:53,840
lvory Coast that OPEC doesn't
even know about.

1461
01:29:54,084 --> 01:29:55,949
The phone numbers all check out.

1462
01:29:58,155 --> 01:29:59,782
It's all on the level.

1463
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:03,425
No wonder Valentine was confused.

1464
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:18,540
Thank God there are still legal ways

1465
01:30:18,775 --> 01:30:21,005
to exploit developing countries.

1466
01:30:21,445 --> 01:30:23,310
The only problem with an honest buck

1467
01:30:23,547 --> 01:30:25,139
is they're so hard to make.

1468
01:30:25,382 --> 01:30:26,679
The margins are too low.

1469
01:30:26,917 --> 01:30:28,748
Too many people are doing it.

1470
01:30:32,689 --> 01:30:36,250
Still, I'd promised Ava.

1471
01:30:44,801 --> 01:30:47,964
Yuri, the President of Liberia
is on his way up.

1472
01:30:50,106 --> 01:30:51,471
He's early.

1473
01:30:52,509 --> 01:30:53,942
I'll be back in a minute.

1474
01:31:00,951 --> 01:31:03,078
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

1475
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,117
We are here for peace talks at the
United Nations.

1476
01:31:05,355 --> 01:31:05,980
So at the same time you thought

1477
01:31:06,223 --> 01:31:07,520
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

1478
01:31:07,757 --> 01:31:08,689
Well, I was beginning to wonder

1479
01:31:08,925 --> 01:31:11,155
whether that was still your profession.

1480
01:31:11,394 --> 01:31:11,951
You know, you're a hard man

1481
01:31:12,195 --> 01:31:14,561
to get a hold of all of Sudden.

1482
01:31:14,798 --> 01:31:16,322
That is a shame.

1483
01:31:16,566 --> 01:31:20,058
My son and I were hoping to do
a little shopping.

1484
01:31:20,303 --> 01:31:21,395
While in New York.

1485
01:31:21,638 --> 01:31:22,468
You know they're watching you.

1486
01:31:22,706 --> 01:31:24,230
Yes, I know they blame me.

1487
01:31:24,474 --> 01:31:26,874
They blame me for everything,
those hypocrites.

1488
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,805
There're hunt for a witch.

1489
01:31:29,045 --> 01:31:30,239
Witch hunt.

1490
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,846
Hostilities have escalated.

1491
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:36,246
And they are making it very
difficult for me to re-supply.

1492
01:31:36,486 --> 01:31:42,118
That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.

1493
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,791
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

1494
01:31:52,736 --> 01:31:54,067
I understand.

1495
01:31:56,072 --> 01:31:57,733
But you should know this:

1496
01:31:57,974 --> 01:31:59,202
Due to our present situation

1497
01:31:59,442 --> 01:32:03,776
we are compelled to be unusually generous.

1498
01:32:08,552 --> 01:32:13,046
So, see you soon, Lord of War.

1499
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,326
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

1500
01:32:36,313 --> 01:32:38,076
At four and a half months old...

1501
01:32:38,315 --> 01:32:41,079
a human fetus has a reptile's tail...

1502
01:32:41,318 --> 01:32:43,149
a remnant of our evolution.

1503
01:32:43,386 --> 01:32:45,286
Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.

1504
01:32:45,522 --> 01:32:47,717
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive,

1505
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,721
but if you fight your biology,

1506
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,949
you always lose.

1507
01:32:51,194 --> 01:32:52,388
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?

1508
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:53,857
I'm not leaving for another ten minutes.

1509
01:32:54,097 --> 01:32:57,123
Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.

1510
01:32:57,367 --> 01:32:59,062
You know, I'm kind of glad you're going.

1511
01:32:59,302 --> 01:32:59,893
You've been here so long

1512
01:33:00,136 --> 01:33:02,001
you're starting to get on my nerves.

1513
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:04,172
This oil concession should be
wrapped up by Thursday.

1514
01:33:04,407 --> 01:33:05,533
I'll be back for the weekend.

1515
01:33:05,775 --> 01:33:06,673
We'll go somewhere.

1516
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:07,774
The sea.

1517
01:33:08,011 --> 01:33:09,308
That would be fun.

1518
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:10,712
Come on.

1519
01:33:10,947 --> 01:33:14,348
Hey. You trust me, right?

1520
01:33:16,386 --> 01:33:17,614
She looked me directly in the eye...

1521
01:33:17,854 --> 01:33:18,616
the way I've looked in the eyes

1522
01:33:18,855 --> 01:33:20,379
of a thousand customs officials...

1523
01:33:20,624 --> 01:33:23,252
government bureaucrats and
law enforcement agents.

1524
01:33:23,493 --> 01:33:25,552
Yes, I trust you.

1525
01:33:25,795 --> 01:33:27,763
And she lied without flinching.

1526
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:29,889
I'll see you, big guy.

1527
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,799
Bye Papa.

1528
01:33:32,102 --> 01:33:33,535
She learned from the best.

1529
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:34,998
Have a good trip.

1530
01:33:52,355 --> 01:33:53,515
That's him.

1531
01:34:14,144 --> 01:34:15,668
Where are we going, Mama?

1532
01:34:15,912 --> 01:34:16,936
It's a game, honey.

1533
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,546
Like hide and seek?

1534
01:34:19,783 --> 01:34:20,875
Yes.

1535
01:34:22,385 --> 01:34:24,285
Like hide and seek.

1536
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:46,934
I can always sense
when I'm being tailed.

1537
01:34:47,177 --> 01:34:48,804
I know what to look for.

1538
01:34:49,045 --> 01:34:51,843
But then I'd never been tailed
by the woman I love.

1539
01:35:04,327 --> 01:35:06,761
I can put myself in Ava's place.

1540
01:35:06,996 --> 01:35:08,395
She might've understood if the combination

1541
01:35:08,631 --> 01:35:10,895
was the last four digits of my
social security number...

1542
01:35:11,134 --> 01:35:12,362
my birth date, even her birth date,

1543
01:35:12,602 --> 01:35:14,194
but not Nicolai's.

1544
01:35:30,386 --> 01:35:31,683
My son's birthday unlocked

1545
01:35:31,921 --> 01:35:32,945
what the government would
later describe...

1546
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:35,419
...as "a catalogue of carnage."

1547
01:35:45,835 --> 01:35:47,359
Nicki, stay right there.

1548
01:36:50,867 --> 01:36:52,061
Come on, Nicki.

1549
01:37:05,281 --> 01:37:06,908
Come to see how the other half lives?

1550
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:08,845
I miss your borscht.

1551
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:10,177
Mom and Dad say you're clean.

1552
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:11,717
Yeah, you, too.

1553
01:37:13,256 --> 01:37:14,621
You went legit, huh?

1554
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:16,823
That's hard to believe.

1555
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,755
That's because it's not true.

1556
01:37:20,864 --> 01:37:21,728
Only you know.

1557
01:37:21,965 --> 01:37:23,660
I'm leaving tonight on a job

1558
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,390
I want you to come.

1559
01:37:26,703 --> 01:37:31,265
I can't. I've got a girlfriend.

1560
01:37:32,108 --> 01:37:34,008
I think she might be the one.

1561
01:37:34,477 --> 01:37:37,207
Plus, I'm thinking of opening
my own place.

1562
01:37:37,447 --> 01:37:38,937
Maybe this trip will help.

1563
01:37:39,182 --> 01:37:40,547
It's good money.

1564
01:37:43,253 --> 01:37:47,155
Yuri, I've given my word.

1565
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:48,948
No one has to know.

1566
01:37:49,192 --> 01:37:51,456
Tell them we going for a little R and R.

1567
01:37:54,564 --> 01:37:56,293
What do you need me for,
all of sudden?

1568
01:37:56,532 --> 01:37:58,363
West Africa's fucked up.

1569
01:37:58,835 --> 01:38:00,393
More than usual.

1570
01:38:01,204 --> 01:38:03,195
I can't trust anybody.

1571
01:38:06,109 --> 01:38:08,373
I need you to watch my back.

1572
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:13,340
Brothers in arms.

1573
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:29,862
Monrovia, Liberia - 2001

1574
01:38:46,983 --> 01:38:51,147
Yuri! Welcome back.

1575
01:38:53,456 --> 01:38:55,048
Welcome both of you.

1576
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:56,986
Welcome to democracy.

1577
01:38:57,226 --> 01:38:58,022
Democracy?

1578
01:38:58,261 --> 01:38:59,523
What have you been drinking, Andy?

1579
01:38:59,762 --> 01:39:01,627
Huh, you have not seen the news.

1580
01:39:01,864 --> 01:39:04,025
You know they accuse me of
rigging elections.

1581
01:39:04,267 --> 01:39:08,465
But after this, with your Florida and
you Supreme Court of Kangaroos,

1582
01:39:08,705 --> 01:39:12,402
Now, the U.S. Must shut up forever.

1583
01:39:16,512 --> 01:39:18,036
How do you do this, Yuri?

1584
01:39:19,782 --> 01:39:21,113
How do you do this,

1585
01:39:21,351 --> 01:39:24,582
when they are watching all of
my airspace?

1586
01:39:24,821 --> 01:39:26,413
Where there's a will,
there's a weapon.

1587
01:39:28,057 --> 01:39:29,786
Come on, where's my fucking money?

1588
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:36,191
When it is delivered.

1589
01:39:38,067 --> 01:39:38,965
It is delivered.

1590
01:39:39,202 --> 01:39:40,794
This is not for me.

1591
01:39:41,037 --> 01:39:43,164
This is for my neighbors to the west.

1592
01:39:43,406 --> 01:39:44,395
The west?

1593
01:39:46,075 --> 01:39:47,474
We're going to Sierra Leone.

1594
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:50,702
Oh, yes. And my son Baptiste Junior

1595
01:39:50,947 --> 01:39:54,246
will go with you to make the
proper introductions.

1596
01:39:54,484 --> 01:39:56,349
We have no trucks.

1597
01:39:56,586 --> 01:39:57,610
You will.

1598
01:39:57,854 --> 01:40:01,051
As soon as we get the food out of them.

1599
01:40:05,962 --> 01:40:07,623
Gun of Rambo.

1600
01:40:08,097 --> 01:40:11,396
Mr. Yuri, you're a man of your word.

1601
01:40:11,634 --> 01:40:13,192
So where are we going?

1602
01:40:13,436 --> 01:40:17,099
RUF - the Freedom Fighters.

1603
01:40:17,874 --> 01:40:21,275
Every faction in Africa calls
themselves by the noble names.

1604
01:40:21,511 --> 01:40:23,240
Liberation-this Patriotic-that,

1605
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:26,107
Democratic Republic
of-something-or-other.

1606
01:40:29,519 --> 01:40:32,147
I guess they can't own up to
what they usually are

1607
01:40:32,388 --> 01:40:35,824
Federation of Worse Oppressors
than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.

1608
01:40:42,598 --> 01:40:44,463
Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur

1609
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:48,329
when both combatants proclaim
themselves "freedom fighters."

1610
01:40:54,077 --> 01:40:57,979
Right, I've got 500 units, brand new
right out of the box,

1611
01:40:58,214 --> 01:41:00,944
all as clean as this. What have you got?

1612
01:41:18,468 --> 01:41:21,062
God! Oh, Jesus.

1613
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:26,602
God! Oh, Jesus.

1614
01:41:29,912 --> 01:41:31,880
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

1615
01:41:32,115 --> 01:41:33,082
Not now.

1616
01:41:33,316 --> 01:41:34,374
Now.

1617
01:41:36,486 --> 01:41:37,646
Excuse me.

1618
01:41:45,428 --> 01:41:46,417
What?

1619
01:41:47,597 --> 01:41:49,827
We can't do this deal.
The fuck we can't!

1620
01:41:50,066 --> 01:41:50,760
What's the matter with you?

1621
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,468
Look, over there.

1622
01:41:53,703 --> 01:41:56,467
As soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die!

1623
01:41:57,907 --> 01:42:00,967
It's not our business.

1624
01:42:02,011 --> 01:42:04,741
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

1625
01:42:08,684 --> 01:42:10,379
What is the holdup?

1626
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:11,314
There is no holdup.

1627
01:42:11,554 --> 01:42:13,078
I'll be right there.

1628
01:42:13,322 --> 01:42:14,721
Vitaly, it's what we always know:

1629
01:42:14,957 --> 01:42:15,889
We can't control what they do.

1630
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:19,026
No, no, today we can. Today we can.

1631
01:42:19,262 --> 01:42:20,695
Yuri, they're right there!

1632
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:21,919
What do you think they'll do to us

1633
01:42:22,165 --> 01:42:24,224
if we back out? They'll kill us.

1634
01:42:24,467 --> 01:42:26,935
And if we go ahead, what do you
think they'll do to them?

1635
01:42:31,841 --> 01:42:33,206
We've got to do something.

1636
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:36,137
Please, for fuck's sake.

1637
01:42:36,379 --> 01:42:37,505
It's not our fight.

1638
01:42:37,747 --> 01:42:40,215
Please. Brothers in arms.

1639
01:42:42,018 --> 01:42:43,315
What is he saying?

1640
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:45,612
It's the deal.

1641
01:42:45,855 --> 01:42:47,015
My brother's not happy with the terms.

1642
01:42:47,256 --> 01:42:49,918
We'll work it out. It's nothing.

1643
01:42:57,867 --> 01:43:00,097
Right? It's nothing.

1644
01:43:06,275 --> 01:43:09,335
Yeah. Nothing.

1645
01:43:11,214 --> 01:43:13,444
You're right. Yuri, you're right.

1646
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:16,841
God, I've got to get my shit together.

1647
01:43:17,954 --> 01:43:19,512
This is not our fight.

1648
01:43:19,755 --> 01:43:20,744
Right.

1649
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:22,457
Okay. What's the deal?

1650
01:43:22,692 --> 01:43:28,187
300 RPGs, 500 assault rifles
and 800 grenades.

1651
01:43:30,032 --> 01:43:33,092
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1652
01:43:35,671 --> 01:43:37,161
I was so caught up in the deal...

1653
01:43:37,406 --> 01:43:39,840
I never realized
what was going on in Vitaly's head.

1654
01:43:40,076 --> 01:43:42,442
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1655
01:43:42,878 --> 01:43:43,742
Confused.

1656
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:44,605
Come to think about it,

1657
01:43:44,847 --> 01:43:48,146
maybe I never understood what
was going on in his head.

1658
01:43:52,255 --> 01:43:53,688
I beg your pardon.

1659
01:43:53,923 --> 01:43:55,390
May I see another stone?

1660
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:58,287
One thing I do understand
for certain...

1661
01:43:58,527 --> 01:44:01,621
...is that Vitaly broke the
cardinal rule of gunrunning.

1662
01:44:01,964 --> 01:44:04,933
Never pick up a gun and join
the customers.

1663
01:44:11,974 --> 01:44:13,373
What are you doing?

1664
01:44:17,246 --> 01:44:18,713
Something for Yuri.

1665
01:44:20,082 --> 01:44:22,983
Step away. Slow.

1666
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:42,804
No, Vit!

1667
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:46,230
No! Vit!

1668
01:46:12,361 --> 01:46:13,885
Only half the guns were gone...

1669
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:16,997
so I was still entitled to half the diamonds.

1670
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,593
If I took them, I was lost.

1671
01:46:19,835 --> 01:46:22,167
If I left them, I was lost.

1672
01:46:30,346 --> 01:46:33,611
The massacre played out exactly
how Vitaly predicted.

1673
01:46:33,849 --> 01:46:35,373
But then, a half-dozen
other massacres

1674
01:46:35,618 --> 01:46:38,086
happened in Sierra Leone that week.

1675
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,753
You can't stop them all.

1676
01:46:39,989 --> 01:46:43,083
In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.

1677
01:46:44,493 --> 01:46:48,156
They say evil prevails
when good men fail to act.

1678
01:46:48,397 --> 01:46:52,493
What they ought to say is,
evil prevails.

1679
01:47:06,148 --> 01:47:07,775
I now shared even more in common...

1680
01:47:08,017 --> 01:47:11,475
with the leader of that country God
seemed to have forsaken.

1681
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,746
We saw something in each other
that neither of us liked.

1682
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:17,959
Or maybe we were just looking
in the mirror.

1683
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,605
I paid a Monrovian doctor
twenty dollars

1684
01:47:39,849 --> 01:47:41,612
to remove the lead from
Vitaly's body

1685
01:47:41,851 --> 01:47:44,752
and write a bogus death certificate.

1686
01:47:44,987 --> 01:47:46,614
I should've paid more.

1687
01:47:46,856 --> 01:47:48,790
I've smuggled millions of
rounds of ammunition,

1688
01:47:49,024 --> 01:47:50,719
and the bullet that lands me in jail...

1689
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,554
is found under my dead brother's rib.

1690
01:47:55,097 --> 01:47:56,894
Yuri Orlov.

1691
01:47:57,132 --> 01:47:59,965
We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms.

1692
01:48:00,202 --> 01:48:00,896
Let me guess.

1693
01:48:01,136 --> 01:48:03,832
This is not about the alcohol or
the tobacco.

1694
01:48:45,481 --> 01:48:46,743
Crimean Restaurant.

1695
01:48:46,982 --> 01:48:48,313
Papa?

1696
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:58,120
Both my sons are dead.

1697
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:03,524
There are only two tragedies in life.

1698
01:49:03,766 --> 01:49:05,893
One is not getting what you want.

1699
01:49:06,135 --> 01:49:07,329
The other is getting it.

1700
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:08,400
Is this one of yours?

1701
01:49:08,637 --> 01:49:11,435
Jack Valentine finally had
what he wanted.

1702
01:49:11,674 --> 01:49:16,338
Curiously, the death certificate says
he died of heart failure.

1703
01:49:17,079 --> 01:49:19,377
Falsifying a death certificate?

1704
01:49:19,615 --> 01:49:21,378
That's not gonna hold me.

1705
01:49:21,617 --> 01:49:25,212
You're right. As usual, you are right.

1706
01:49:27,723 --> 01:49:31,056
Have you seen today's paper? Huh?

1707
01:49:37,299 --> 01:49:38,789
Fake end-user certificates.

1708
01:49:39,034 --> 01:49:42,162
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

1709
01:49:42,404 --> 01:49:46,340
There is hardly a warlord, dictator,
despot anywhere in the world

1710
01:49:46,575 --> 01:49:48,634
that you're a first-name basis with.

1711
01:49:49,111 --> 01:49:54,105
It was your wife your trophy wife
that led us to the prize.

1712
01:49:54,917 --> 01:49:55,508
It's not her fault.

1713
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:58,117
She's just easier to follow
than you are.

1714
01:49:59,955 --> 01:50:01,479
May I?

1715
01:50:01,724 --> 01:50:03,214
Yeah, go ahead.

1716
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:29,178
Enjoy it.

1717
01:50:29,918 --> 01:50:31,943
What? This.

1718
01:50:32,554 --> 01:50:34,852
Tell me I'm everything you despise.

1719
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:37,524
That I'm the personification of evil.

1720
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:38,624
What?

1721
01:50:38,861 --> 01:50:43,525
Responsible for the breakdown of
the fabric of society and world order.

1722
01:50:43,766 --> 01:50:46,200
I'm a one-man genocide.

1723
01:50:46,435 --> 01:50:48,403
Say everything you want to say
to me now.

1724
01:50:49,138 --> 01:50:51,003
Because you don't have long.

1725
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:52,901
Are you paying attention?

1726
01:50:53,809 --> 01:50:56,175
Or are you delusional?

1727
01:50:56,412 --> 01:50:59,643
You have broken every arms
embargo written.

1728
01:50:59,882 --> 01:51:04,080
There is enough here to put you away
for consecutive life sentences.

1729
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:05,877
You are going to spend
the next ten years of your life

1730
01:51:06,121 --> 01:51:09,352
going from a cell to a courtroom
before you even start

1731
01:51:09,591 --> 01:51:11,115
serving your time.

1732
01:51:13,729 --> 01:51:16,095
I don't think you fully
appreciate the seriousness...

1733
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:18,060
...of your situation.

1734
01:51:28,143 --> 01:51:31,112
My family has disowned me.

1735
01:51:32,381 --> 01:51:35,350
My wife and son have left me.

1736
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:39,781
My brother's dead.

1737
01:51:40,656 --> 01:51:42,055
Trust me.

1738
01:51:42,291 --> 01:51:45,886
I fully appreciate the seriousness
of my situation.

1739
01:51:46,128 --> 01:51:48,096
But I promise you,

1740
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:51,231
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

1741
01:51:52,167 --> 01:51:53,634
You are delusional.

1742
01:51:54,303 --> 01:51:55,793
I like you, Jack.

1743
01:51:56,739 --> 01:52:00,766
Well, maybe not,
but I understand you.

1744
01:52:03,979 --> 01:52:06,413
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1745
01:52:07,249 --> 01:52:10,776
This way, you can prepare yourself.

1746
01:52:14,256 --> 01:52:15,314
Okay.

1747
01:52:15,557 --> 01:52:17,115
Soon there's going to be
a knock on that door

1748
01:52:17,359 --> 01:52:18,758
and you will be called outside.

1749
01:52:18,994 --> 01:52:21,360
In the hall there will be
a man who outranks you.

1750
01:52:21,597 --> 01:52:24,657
First, he'll compliment you on the
fine job you've done

1751
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,868
that you're making the world
a safer place

1752
01:52:27,102 --> 01:52:31,539
that you're to receive
a commendation and a promotion.

1753
01:52:31,774 --> 01:52:34,436
And then he'll tell you that
I am to be released.

1754
01:52:34,676 --> 01:52:36,541
You're gonna protest.

1755
01:52:37,045 --> 01:52:39,878
You'll probably threaten to resign.

1756
01:52:40,115 --> 01:52:42,879
But in the end, I will be released.

1757
01:52:43,185 --> 01:52:45,483
The reason I'll be released
is the same reason you think...

1758
01:52:45,721 --> 01:52:47,655
I'll be convicted.

1759
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:50,552
I do rub shoulders with some of
the most vile,

1760
01:52:50,793 --> 01:52:53,990
sadistic men calling themselves
leaders today.

1761
01:52:55,130 --> 01:53:01,535
But some of those men are
the enemies of your enemies.

1762
01:53:02,571 --> 01:53:06,530
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss...

1763
01:53:06,775 --> 01:53:08,572
...the President of the United States,

1764
01:53:08,811 --> 01:53:10,403
who ships more merchandise in a day

1765
01:53:10,646 --> 01:53:12,944
I do in a year...

1766
01:53:13,582 --> 01:53:17,951
sometimes it's embarrassing to have
his fingerprints on the guns.

1767
01:53:18,187 --> 01:53:21,020
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

1768
01:53:21,256 --> 01:53:22,188
to supply forces

1769
01:53:22,424 --> 01:53:30,695
he can't be seen supplying.
So... you call me evil,

1770
01:53:30,933 --> 01:53:35,768
but unfortunately for you,
I'm a necessary evil.

1771
01:53:51,687 --> 01:53:54,121
I would tell you to go to hell.

1772
01:53:55,157 --> 01:53:57,352
But I think you're already there.

1773
01:54:32,027 --> 01:54:33,995
Pleasure doing business with you.

1774
01:54:34,229 --> 01:54:36,629
Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.

1775
01:54:36,865 --> 01:54:39,299
I expect to be paid to leave.

1776
01:54:39,534 --> 01:54:40,523
I'm not a fool.

1777
01:54:40,769 --> 01:54:42,498
I know that just because they
needed me that day

1778
01:54:42,738 --> 01:54:45,639
didn't mean they wouldn't make
me a scapegoat the next.

1779
01:54:45,874 --> 01:54:47,398
But I was back,

1780
01:54:47,643 --> 01:54:49,577
doing what I do best.

1781
01:54:49,912 --> 01:54:51,436
Umbrellas to the Sahara?

1782
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,307
Sun umbrellas.

1783
01:55:12,134 --> 01:55:14,568
You know who's going to
inherit the Earth?

1784
01:55:14,803 --> 01:55:16,236
Arms dealers.

1785
01:55:16,471 --> 01:55:19,702
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

1786
01:55:19,942 --> 01:55:22,001
That's the secret to survival.

1787
01:55:22,244 --> 01:55:23,768
Never go to war.

1788
01:55:27,082 --> 01:55:29,277
Especially with yourself.
