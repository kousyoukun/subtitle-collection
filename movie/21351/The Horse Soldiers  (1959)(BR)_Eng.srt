General Hurlburt, by appointment.

32
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,913
- General Hurlburt and Colonel Marlowe.
- Steve, come in.

33
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,251
Hello, Sam. Colonel Marlowe.

34
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,006
- General Sherman, Colonel Marlowe.
- How do you do?

35
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,759
Marlowe, I've been anxious to meet you.

36
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,762
- It's a privilege, sir.
- Sit down.

37
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,560
- Is this your first look at Vicksburg?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,148
We've been looking at it
for ten months, and we don't like it.

39
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,528
Colonel, for your benefit,
the war on our side

40
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,030
hasn't been going well at all.

41
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:22,367
Not in Washington,
not in the newspapers, not in the field.

42
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,623
To put it mildly,
with less men and less resources,

43
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,083
the South has whipped us
to a standstill.

44
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,714
Now, if I could take Vicksburg...

45
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,680
...the whole picture would change,
but I'd have to do it this summer.

46
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,682
Or sit out here another year.

47
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,978
Which might cost us 100,000 men.
It might cost us a war.

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,191
Which brings all this talk down to
their main source of supply...

49
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,401
...and a thorn in our side.

50
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,529
- Newton Station.
- Sam.

51
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,658
Marlowe has worked out the details
of your plan pretty thoroughly.

52
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,825
Let's hear them.

53
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:08,830
If I could get back to La Grange
right away, we could leave by Thursday.

54
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,166
Good. Who would your people be?

55
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:16,338
My own First Illinois with Secord's
First Michigan and Second Iowa.

56
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,840
We'd be culled down to a short brigade.

57
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,261
Cross at La Grange, down through Ripley,
New Albany, Houston...

58
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,267
- Is there something wrong, sir?
- I know the map, Colonel. Proceed.

59
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,772
Anyway, the main trick is
no fighting until we hit Newton Station.

60
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,983
How much track do you figure to destroy?

61
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,943
As much as I can get my hands on.

62
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,405
At least enough to keep them busy for
a couple of months rebuilding.

63
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,616
Otherwise, the raid would
just be another horse ride.

64
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,995
All right, Colonel, go ahead.

65
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,664
All the rails, ties, buildings, bridges,

66
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,749
all the rolling stock
you can get your hands on.

67
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,961
Sam, even if he should manage
to get through to Newton Station,

68
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,047
he'd be 300 miles dead center
in the Confederacy.

69
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,303
- Have you thought how you'd get back?
- Have you, sir?

70
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,431
Well, I guess I asked for that.

71
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,976
But I hate to think of you sitting it
out in Andersonville Prison.

72
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,187
- It's a hellhole.
- I'd think about that twice, too, sir.

73
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,400
Well, Colonel, your success.

74
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,171
All right, here is La Grange.

75
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,760
- We will make 35 miles a day, average.
- 35?

76
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:50,140
- 35? Isn't that stretching it a bit?
- It will be the first day, Ned.

77
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,685
I intend to make twice that distance.
In an operation like this,

78
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,604
everything is stretched.
Even our necks...

79
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,647
Now, just hold on a minute, John.

80
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,859
Regarding cutting the men's rations
from five days to three...

81
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,362
They'll have to live off
the land eventually.

82
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,697
They might as well get used to it
while they're fresh.

83
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,449
They actually seem excited.

84
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,203
There's a rumor around camp they're
headed for Nashville in a parade.

85
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:15,165
That was a good rumor to spread,
with the help of the Sergeant Major.

86
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,459
- Thank you, sir.
- And, gentlemen,

87
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,505
I'll have to admit
they had me fooled too.

88
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:26,718
You see, I was going to use my leave
to do a little electioneering back home.

89
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,597
You know, shake a few hands,
kiss a few babies.

90
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,725
You see, I'm running
for Congress this fall.

91
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,063
Well, there's 30,000 votes
at Andersonville, Phil.

92
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,482
I hope you don't get to shake
any of their hands.

93
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,985
Leaves are being cancelled,

94
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,072
Orders to reshoe
the whole blasted outfit,

95
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,741
and some of them shoes
ain't even shiny yet.

96
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,660
Yep.

97
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,829
I'm trying to figure out what's up.

98
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,749
They've been sitting under that tree
all the morning.

99
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,587
I heard some scuttlebutt about us being
pulled out for a big parade up North.

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,759
- I figure we're heading for Nashville.
- That's to my liking.

101
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:12,139
A parade, and then leave.
Now this war is starting to shape up.

102
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,439
- Where's the officers' conference?
- Over under that tree yonder, sir.

103
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,359
Thank you.

104
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,582
- My apologies for being late.
- Understood.

105
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,169
- Sit down, Major.
- I don't believe I know the Major.

106
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,422
I'm sorry.
Colonel Marlowe, Major Kendall.

107
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,632
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you.

108
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,678
Major Kendall has just been assigned to
us from General Grant's headquarters.

109
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:56,725
The Major seems to be out of uniform.
Where are your side arms, Kendall?

110
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,562
If you look in the book, you'll see
a surgeon doesn't carry them.

111
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:08,987
Surgeon? You cut out our artillery and
our wagons. Nothing to slow us down.

112
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,532
And now you saddle us
with a doctor and a medical unit?

113
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,952
Regulations, John. Kendall goes along.

114
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,288
Very well, sir. Any questions?

115
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,081
All I can say is
I'm glad for some action...

116
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,125
No glory hunting, Richard.

117
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,669
If anything knocks this
into a cocked hat, it'll be a firefight.

118
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,088
- Is that all, sir?
- One thing.

119
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,757
- Logan, is Brady ready?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,134
Oh, a photograph...

121
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,555
Move away, move away. Move back.

122
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,806
Are you ready for us, Brady?

123
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,271
Colonel. Sit down, Colonel.

124
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,025
- Thank you very much.
- That's all right.

125
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,986
Sit down, Marlowe.
No hats, please, gentlemen.

126
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,534
That's right. Nice and relaxed.

127
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:02,374
Now, roses are red, violets are blue,
the camera's looking straight at you.

128
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,502
Oh, I must have another one.
That man in the white coat moved.

129
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,048
That isn't all he'll be moving before
long. Sorry General, is that all?

130
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,677
- That's all. Thank you, Mr. Brady.
- Kendall.

131
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,303
Thank you, General.
Thank you very much.

132
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,309
Sit down.

133
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,438
Colonel, I gather you're not too happy
about my going along.

134
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,149
I hadn't counted on you, that's all.

135
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,070
I can understand your reasons
for trying to avoid a fight,

136
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,783
tactically speaking. But you're going
very deep into enemy territory.

137
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,412
Tell me, what did you intend to do
about your wounded?

138
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,915
I intend to move, and move fast.

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,834
Those too badly shot up to carry on

140
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,336
will be left to the clemency
of the enemy.

141
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,007
- Civilian or military.
- Including yourself?

142
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,091
Naturally.

143
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,930
That's a pretty primitive attitude.
Medically speaking.

144
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,227
Well, Doctor,
war isn't exactly a civilized business.

145
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:09,608
Of course, I realize that it gives you
fellas a wider field of opportunity...

146
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,236
- For experimenting, Colonel?
- I didn't say that.

147
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,196
- Mitch.
- Yes, sir?

148
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,867
- Give the doctor a full roster.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,702
Examine every man.

150
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,331
Throw out any man who,
in your unchallenged opinion,

151
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,541
of course, is unfit.

152
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,878
Even those who might get sick
a week from today.

153
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,633
Look, Colonel, I didn't ask
to be assigned to this mission.

154
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,219
I'm a military doctor. I've been ordered
to go and I'm going to do my job.

155
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,263
So get off my back.

156
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,733
- Bugler!
- Yes, sir?

157
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,026
Get me Mitchell.

158
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,153
Sergeant Major Mitchell's
in the hospital, sir.

159
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,335
- How old are you?
- 32, sir.

160
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,129
Join that group.

161
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,264
Hang on, son. Here we go.

162
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,352
Yow!

163
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,526
This is going to hurt worse.

164
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,078
There. He'll be all right.

165
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,045
- I got your sick list, Kendall.
- Good. I'm glad it's a short one.

166
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,839
We'll let that drain full out.

167
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,883
- I approve of that, Doctor.
- The lad had quite a boil.

168
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,178
I didn't come here to watch you
carving anybody's behind.

169
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,808
- Why's Mitchell's name on that list?
- Sir, we observe quiet here.

170
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,060
- What's this?
- Hoppy, this is Colonel Marlowe.

171
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,939
How do you do? Stand in line.
We'll take care of you presently.

172
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,694
- Is he going with us?
- He's a good man. I need him.

173
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,238
And I need Mitchell.
He's strong as a bull...

174
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,656
Let me show you something.

175
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:32,250
Colonel, I've been trying to tell the
doctor that this is nothing unusual.

176
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,002
No, not for a man with malaria.

177
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,255
There's nothing new about this, Kendall.

178
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,092
I've seen him ride 40 miles
in one day, shivering in his saddle.

179
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,637
- He's had malaria twice as long as...
- So you concur in my diagnosis.

180
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,015
Come on Mitch, get out of bed.
I got some whiskey in my tent.

181
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,267
You stay where you are, Sergeant.

182
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,436
I was ordered to take off
the duty roster any man who,

183
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,605
in my unchallenged opinion, was unfit.

184
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,610
He's sick and he's going to stay here.
Those are my orders.

185
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,779
You've read the whole book, haven't you?

186
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,955
Oh, Colonel!

187
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,792
We got that fella
with all them stripes for you.

188
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,669
- Bring him in.
- We hauled him right off the train.

189
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,174
- Sergeant Kirby reporting, sir.
- Well, Kirby.

190
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,093
Besides being slightly drunk,
what's got you riled up?

191
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,888
They got me in town.
Pulled me off the train.

192
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,432
Just gotten filled.
My first in two years.

193
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,185
They tell me you're good. You better be.

194
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,480
You're replacing the best soldier
in the regiment.

195
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,068
- I expect you to be happy about that.
- I could be happier where I was going.

196
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,738
- You got me there.
- No, sir, you got me here.

197
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,740
- Sir.
- Sir.

198
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,827
Alright, march this sergeant
down to the river and throw him in.

199
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,829
- Clothes and all?
- Clothes and all.

200
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,332
Pump him full of black coffee
till it runs out his ears.

201
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,961
Kirby, when you come back,
come back sober. You've got two hours.

202
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,297
- Parades, Nashville...
- You can leave that keg.

203
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,260
You're welcome to it... sir.

204
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,972
Kirby, you tangle with me
and I'll have your hide.

205
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,100
You're welcome to that too, sir.
If it's in the line of duty.

206
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,458
- Forward, left!
- Forward, left!

207
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,338
- Yo!
- Yo!

222
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,269
Wait on here a minute.

223
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,107
The sun, it raises in the
east every time, don't it?

224
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,358
It sure does in Missouri.

225
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,820
For eight hours, with no turning,
we've been heading this way.

226
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,365
Now, if'n the sun raises in the east,
what direction is that?

227
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,244
- It ain't north.
- Course not. It's south.

228
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,081
Hey, we've been riding smack-dab
into reb territory.

229
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,586
- Reb country, Richard.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,763
Send out your scouts.

231
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,705
Are you going to call a halt, or lead
them to the clemency of the enemy?

232
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,338
Sound recall.

233
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,159
Just a patrol, sir. No sign of any
major force, as far as I could tell.

234
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,954
The fact remains we've been spotted.

235
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,413
The word's out for sure now.

236
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:49,210
They'll be back here with
everything available looking for us.

237
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,130
All right, Ned,
you can prepare to turn back.

238
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,550
That's a bad mistake, John,
splitting the force.

239
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,220
Now you need every man you've got.
Diversion be damned.

240
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,556
We've got to make them think that
we all turned back.

241
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,182
Oh, sure, sure.

242
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,811
But you out to remember that from now
on, every Johnny Reb with a gun

243
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,647
is going to be hiding behind a tree
trying to make a name for himself.

244
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,734
And you want to cut your force
by one third! Aw, John, listen to me.

245
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,489
There's an old axiom in politics:
you never split your ballot...

246
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,993
Richard, when the horses are watered
and the men are fed, we'll move out.

247
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,077
Yes, sir.

248
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,505
Hey, Doctor.

249
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,552
These here contraband children say
there's something wrong at that cabin.

250
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,429
I guess they need a doctor.

251
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,352
All right.

252
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,613
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes, I am.

253
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,584
What happened?

254
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,171
It's Rainey, sir. Rainey the first.
He's dead.

255
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,466
Carry on.

256
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,554
Where's Kendall?

257
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,892
Dr. Kendall went over to that cabin
with some young colored people.

258
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,977
- An emergency, I believe.
- He what?!

259
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,940
He went over to that cabin
with some young colored people.

260
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,323
- Are you the doctor too?
- What? No, no.

261
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,842
Kendall, what the devil are you doing?

262
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,596
We just delivered a baby.

263
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,722
It's a little girl.

264
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,103
You can take care of her now, Granny.

265
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,187
You're going to be all right.

266
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,740
We've got a couple of wounded men
out there, you know.

267
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,200
No, one's dead.

268
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,414
One's gone, one's born.

269
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,292
It's an amazing process, isn't it?

270
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,629
As many as I've delivered,
it never fails to awe me.

271
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,550
All right, children, you got a new
sister. Go in, take a look at her.

272
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,809
All right, Kendall.
Go back and take care of your wounded.

273
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,812
They'll be all right.
Hopkins knows what to do.

274
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:59,900
You're not a country sawbones. You're
an officer in the Union Army under oath.

275
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,654
I took an older oath before that one.

276
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,326
They didn't seem to be having any
trouble having babies around here

277
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,618
before you arrived.

278
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,330
I was sent for and I was asked to help
and I couldn't turn 'em down.

279
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,498
Now come off it Colonel.
Even you were born.

280
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,419
As of right now,
you are under officer's arrest.

281
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,837
Insubordination.

282
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,008
Do I still carry out my duties, sir?

283
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,761
From now on,
you'll confine them to the troops.

284
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,845
Very well, sir.

285
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,098
Don't push me too far, Kendall.

286
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:12,139
Forward! Ho!

287
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,186
Lukey, what are the dogs
raising such a fuss about?

288
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,189
Dogs? You know how dogs
make such a fuss.

289
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,873
- Soldiers, Miss Hannah. Lots of 'em.
- Soldiers? How wonderful!

290
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,311
Thunder in the outhouse.
Them's Yankees.

291
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,481
Lukey, you go on downstairs
and meet them.

292
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,982
Lukey, do you hear?

293
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,007
Come here, girl.

294
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,635
Come on.

295
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:19,558
- Who lives here?
- Miss Hannah Hunter lives here.

296
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,479
Tell her I want to see her.
Colonel Marlowe, Union Army.

297
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,730
Yes, sir.

298
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,275
Put that gun away.

299
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,804
- Sorry for this intrusion, ma'am.
- It isn't that, Colonel.

300
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:01,141
It's just that I never prepared myself
to see that uniform

301
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,143
within the walls of this house.

302
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,189
Ma'am, we no more wish to be here
than you do to have us.

303
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,401
Why, that's gallantly spoken, Colonel.

304
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,404
No matter what our...
well, our differences,

305
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,990
I fear I'm forgetting the amenities.

306
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,284
- Welcome to Greenbriar, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

307
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,246
Lukey, take the gentlemen's hats.

308
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,172
- Sergeant Kirby.
- Sergeant.

309
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,882
Ma'am.

310
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:39,263
Well, shall we make ourselves
more comfortable in the Rose Room?

311
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,600
No, thank you, ma'am.
We'll only stay a moment.

312
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,144
You and your men are riding on?

313
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,814
No, we will bivouac
in your woods for the night.

314
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,775
Sleeping on the cold, cold ground?

315
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,947
When is this awful, wasteful,
terrible struggle going to end, Colonel?

316
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,282
Why, brother against brother...

317
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:03,829
And during our stay no one will
be allowed to leave the premises.

318
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,540
And wherever would we go, Colonel?

319
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,211
I'm sure you must agree that this war
makes loneliness for everyone.

320
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,049
Also, I must commandeer most
of the grain and horses,

321
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,216
if you have any.

322
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:21,388
You will be paid, Miss Hunter,
for everything, in Union greenbacks.

323
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,391
We will not bother you
any longer. Good evening.

324
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,686
- Kirby.
- By your leave, ma'am.

325
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,523
Why Hannah Hunter, what's got hold
of you, talking like a field hand?

326
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,860
- You alls, we alls.
- Yankees!

327
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,951
It's uncanny, Colonel.

328
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,664
I've heard about 'em,
but I didn't believe it.

329
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,666
I'll have you know,
I received my commission

330
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,959
from the Governor from
the sovereign state of Michigan!

331
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,629
- Young man...
- What's your question?

332
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:58,008
The question is this man's authority
in his present position.

333
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,720
As usual, I am trying to present
the grim facts of life.

334
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,473
Colonel Secord doesn't understand
that coffee tastes better

335
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,851
if the latrines are dug
downstream instead of upstream.

336
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,522
How do you like your coffee, Colonel?

337
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,857
- Secord, you oughta...
- Pardon.

338
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,819
Oh, Colonel! Colonel Marlowe!

339
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,493
I am forgetting my manners.
Why, how I ever...

340
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,164
Well, I don't believe
I've met these gentlemen.

341
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:35,379
Miss Hunter. Colonel Secord.
Major Gray. Major Kendall.

342
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,463
Ma'am.

343
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,008
I'm just so scatterbrained.

344
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:44,012
Poor Papa and Mama must be
turning over in their graves at me

345
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,809
for not extending what little
hospitality Greenbriar can offer.

346
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,396
At least I can extend an invitation
to you and your officers for dinner.

347
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,566
- No, Miss Hunter...
- I insist.

348
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,068
There's three fat capons
that have to go anyhow.

349
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:03,699
What with our store of grain
being reduced, like you mentioned.

350
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,202
So, you see, you brought it
on yourself, didn't you?

351
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,289
Speaking for myself,
I would be delighted...

352
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:14,668
Very well, thank you.
Hot food is pretty hard to turn down.

353
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,504
Splendid. Now, how many can I count on?

354
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,257
- Would five or six be...?
- Not at all.

355
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,634
Perfectly wonderful.

356
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,511
At nine, gentlemen?

357
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,097
- Colonel Secord?
- Of the First Michigan, ma'am.

358
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,475
- Major Gray?
- Ma'am.

359
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,894
Major... Kendall, isn't it?

360
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,149
I'm afraid I'll have to regret, ma'am.
It's not of my choice, I assure you.

361
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,777
At the moment, I'm under arrest.

362
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,363
We will all be glad to accept
the invitation, Miss Hunter.

363
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,839
Ma'am?

364
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,425
You dropped your handkerchief.

365
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,638
Care for a little more,
Colonel Secord?

366
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:12,601
- No, thank you, ma'am.
- Colonel Marlowe?

367
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,562
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come now, Colonel.

368
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,066
A man with a big frame like yours
can’t just nibble away

369
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,652
like a little old titmouse.

370
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,822
Gentlemen, please be seated.

371
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:30,661
Now, what was your preference?
The leg... or the breast?

372
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,835
I've had quite enough of both,
thank you.

373
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,504
Oh... What a shame.

374
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,011
- Would anyone else like some more?
- No, thank you.

375
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:53,851
Gentlemen, be seated.
I must warn you too, there's no coffee.

376
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,437
And a sweet or a dessert of any kind
was just out of the question.

377
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,524
Sugar's $150 a barrel.

378
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,612
"And yet your fair discourse
hath been as sweet as sugar,

379
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,157
making the hard way
sweet and delectable."

380
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,371
How perfectly charming.
A little something of your own?

381
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,456
No, ma'am. Richard II.

382
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,670
- By profession, I'm an actor.
- Why, how fascinating!

383
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:25,674
Why, Major Ken...  Your cigar.
Gentlemen, please be seated.

384
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:35,392
Major Kendall a doctor. And
Colonel Secord almost a congressman.

385
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,605
And you an actor.
And now all military men.

386
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,441
Such a waste of talent.

387
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,026
But, of course, Colonel Marlowe,

388
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,821
I imagine that you are
a professional soldier.

389
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,742
No, prior to this insanity,
I was a railroad engineer.

390
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,453
Why, how thrilling.

391
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:59,833
To think of being able to steer one of
those huge things, puffing and steaming.

392
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,503
Ringing that little bell.
Ding-dong! Ding-dong!

393
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,841
Not quite. My job was
in the construction of railroads.

394
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,929
Why, my! Such brilliant minds.

395
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:17,100
Poor little me barely squeezed through
Miss Longstreet's Seminary for Ladies.

396
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,980
How did you ever manage
to remember all those books in college?

397
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,440
I didn't.

398
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:27,945
I started driving rail spikes
at ten cents a day and found.

399
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,572
And now, Miss Hunter,
I must ask you to leave us.

400
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:35,744
We are taking the privilege of using
this room for an hour or two. If we may.

401
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,499
Of course, but wouldn't you prefer
using another room? The study, perhaps?

402
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,044
We're quite comfortable here.

403
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,089
I'm sorry,
but I must be rude and explain.

404
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:51,969
You see, Lukey and I must be in the
fields by five in the morning.

405
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,595
Gentlemen, go ahead
and light your cigars.

406
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,472
- Thank you, ma'am.
- And you see, all this...

407
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,141
- Allow me.
- Thank you kindly.

408
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,144
All this and the dishes must be done
before she can get to bed.

409
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,315
- Am I being too inconsiderate?
- Of course not, ma'am.

410
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,610
- May I?
- Of course. This way, gentlemen.

411
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,904
How wonderful.

412
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,241
Really, I thought it was a
charming dinner.

413
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,333
- Post this room.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,878
- I hope you'll be comfortable here.
- Oh, yes. This is fine.

415
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,092
Now, if you wish to light a fire,
it's all ready.

416
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,301
No, it's fine.

417
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:38,598
- Some brandy. I'll have Lukey bring it.
- No, thank you, no brandy.

418
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,518
Are you sure there's
nothing more that I can...

419
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,270
Oh, yes.

420
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,023
Doctor, there's no need
for you to be a part of this.

421
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:50,110
Perhaps Miss Hunter would show you
some of the beauties of Greenbriar.

422
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,697
Why, of course,
if he has any interest...

423
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,949
He'd be pleased to.

424
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,785
Very well. Come, then, Doctor.

425
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,708
I noticed a lovely garden outside.
Shall we take a stroll?

426
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,377
Why, of course.

427
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,173
You know, you gentlemen must be
comfortable in your heavy uniforms,

428
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:16,053
but I feel a definite chill in the
air... it's me and my thin blood.

429
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,555
Would you excuse me
while I go and fetch a shawl?

430
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,475
- Miss Hunter.
- Yes, Major?

431
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,353
I'm afraid I'll have to go with you.

432
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,898
Upstairs? With me?

433
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,275
- Why, Major!
- You're only getting a shawl.

434
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,528
Of course,
but in these parts it's unheard of...

435
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,364
It's something spicy
to tell your grandchildren.

436
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,327
This is war. At the moment,
Greenbriar is a military installation.

437
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:45,290
I don't suppose there's any real harm,
being that you're a doctor.

438
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,374
That's right.

439
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,009
Lukey, bring some brandy
to my sitting room, please.

440
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,351
I hope you'll be
comfortable here, Major.

441
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,727
Thank you.

442
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,579
Thank you.

443
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,091
Hey! Where are you going with that?

444
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:40,011
- Miss Hannah asked for this brandy.
- Yeah, yeah, I know, for the Major.

445
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:44,850
We never give any of our top-ranking
officers an unlabeled bottle,

446
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,852
unless somebody tastes it first.

447
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,814
- Is this what you does? Test things?
- Certainly.

448
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:55,569
See that second stripe? That means
I'm official taster for majors on up.

449
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,824
Here's La Grange.

450
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:06,121
We've come down here
approximately 80 miles.

451
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,832
We're headed for Newton Station.

452
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,835
Any word on
the enemy strength there?

453
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:16,339
No, not a word. Whatever it is,
we're obliged to take it on.

454
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,343
- Good. Maybe we'll see action.
- This is not play-acting.

455
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,142
- Here's your brandy, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

456
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:31,521
- And it's all tested.
- Tested?

457
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,065
By the man downstairs with
those tester's stripes,

458
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,859
for majors on up.

459
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,112
Oh, yes. Sergeant Kirby.

460
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,283
- He really tested it, didn't he?
- Yes, sir. Twice.

461
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,535
- Lukey?
- Yes, Miss Hannah.

462
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,456
Excuse me, sir.

463
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,509
...very lucky.

464
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:19,527
That is the next piece of information.
We're not going back to La Grange.

465
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,573
- We're what?
- We're not going back north.

466
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:29,663
We're heading south to Baton Rouge
to join up with the Union forces there.

467
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,709
- Great Scott, when did you decide that?
- It's the best way. It's the only way.

468
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:41,925
John, it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to Baton Rouge.

469
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,096
And it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to La Grange.

470
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,474
Only the rebs will really have been
closed in behind us,

471
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,643
ready to chew us to bits.

472
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,938
So we'll go out the way
they least expect: straight south.

473
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,648
Damn it John, it's suicide.

474
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,485
Why we couldn't... Is it possible your
orders could have been misinterpreted?

475
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,779
My only duty after Newton Station

476
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,032
is to get as many of these men
back alive as I can.

477
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,455
And so I still must protest.

478
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,792
And what's more, I want that
on the record for General Hurlburt.

479
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,003
It is impetuous mass suicide.

480
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,089
It's on the record,
but get this.

481
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,717
Unless enemy action
allows you to take my place,

482
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,510
that's the way it will be.

483
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,139
Blow Newton Station off the map,
then through to Baton Rouge.

484
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,766
There will be no change.
Do you understand?

485
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,352
All right, you're in command.

486
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:38,690
Now let's go over it again.
Straight through to Baton Rouge.

487
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,233
We will not turn back.

488
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,282
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Was the brandy satisfactory?

489
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,826
- Excellent. Won't you join me?
- Goodness me, no.

490
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,953
I never touch spirits.

491
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:56,583
My papa taught me that a girl ought
to keep her wits about her at all times.

492
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,877
Your father raised a very smart girl.

493
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,838
You're just being sweet.
Would you like to see the garden?

494
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,340
Didn't you forget your shawl?

495
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,052
Why, Lukey!

496
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,561
Now, Lukey, you take
that tray downstairs

497
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,646
and go about doing what you have to do.

498
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,276
You know, I remember the first time
I tried spirits,

499
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,362
at the Governor's Ball in Jackson.

500
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:30,992
My escort, Adam Lovelace from Biloxi,
well, he gave me a mint julep.

501
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,871
You know, those Lovelace boys
are all very handsome, but fast,

502
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,414
if you know what I mean.

503
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,584
Well, if I could tell you the thoughts
that went on in my mind

504
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,379
after that one julep... My!

505
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,006
I'd rather know the thoughts
going on in your mind right now.

506
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,222
- Kendall, what in the name of...?
- Sorry we have to interrupt.

507
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,724
Maybe we out to ask them
what they think your chances are

508
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,685
of blowing up Newton Station
and getting to Baton Rouge.

509
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,605
- Are you drunk?
- Unfortunately, no.

510
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,400
They were listening upstairs.

511
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,448
Makes a pretty good stethoscope.

512
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,120
Don't feel too guilty.
I was slower to catch on than you.

513
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,205
Where were you, Kendall?

514
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,417
Well, a gentlemen thinks twice
before peeking into a lady's bedroom,

515
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,627
but sometimes it pays off.

516
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,548
Looks like she's made
a fool out of both of us.

517
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,925
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

518
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,847
You know something, Miss Hunter?

519
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,182
You have put me
to quite an inconvenience.

520
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,768
At least I've
accomplished something, sir.

521
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,521
I don't suppose I could accept
your word of honor

522
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,982
not to discuss this with anyone else.

523
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,984
I don't hold to honor
with any Yankees.

524
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,318
Exactly.

525
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,363
So the whole state of Mississippi
will be alerted.

526
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,575
So could you possibly suggest
what I should do with you?

527
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,370
I noticed she was getting on your
nerves. Now's your chance to shoot her.

528
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,541
- One more word out of you...
- Go ahead. Shoot us.

529
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:06,087
Shoot both of us. But you'll never
get away with the rest of your filthy,

530
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,466
murdering plans, Mr. Colonel Marlowe.

531
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,470
You Yankees and your holy principle
about saving the Union.

532
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,015
You're plundering pirates, that's what.

533
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,685
You think there's no Confederate army
where you're going?

534
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:24,814
Do you think our boys
are asleep down here?

535
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,358
They'll catch up to you
and they'll cut you to pieces,

536
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,279
you nameless, fatherless scum!

537
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,575
And I wish I could be there
to see it.

538
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,287
If it happens, Miss Hunter, you will be.

539
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,765
- Hurry it up.
- All right.

540
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,304
You're an excellent rider, Miss Hunter.

541
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,475
Right interesting country, isn't it?

542
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,315
I'm more interested in why you vandals
confiscated my dead father's clothes.

543
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,525
Well, they're for our cadets.

544
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,945
- Scouts.
- Scouts!

545
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,989
Spies, you mean.

546
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:42,368
It's a wonder they don't crawl along
on their bellies like snakes.

547
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,122
You'll find out what happens
to spies down here.

548
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:50,043
My personal experience with spies
is limited. I've only known one.

549
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,713
Do you mind, Major?
I prefer to ride alone.

550
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,257
Ma'am.

551
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,265
Miss Hannah!

552
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,155
All right, forward! Yo-oh!

553
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,243
Back in line, Doctor.

554
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,693
Well.

555
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,905
- These lady's drawers are almost dry.
- Yeah.

556
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,118
Aren't you getting a little chilly?

557
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,370
Don't tell me you're concerned
about my health.

558
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,957
If I give you back your clothes,
will you promise not to run away again?

559
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:17,714
I would, ma'am. There's a point
where pride becomes impractical.

560
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,633
Actually, if you could get a look
at yourself, I'd think you'd agree.

561
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,848
Very well. I do wish to keep my health.

562
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,934
- I shall not try to run away again.
- Your word of honor?

563
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,188
- My word of honor.
- To Yankees?

564
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,776
- To Yankees.
- Cross your heart?

565
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,945
- I gave you my word!
- All right, Lukey.

566
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,739
Help Miss Hunter with her clothes.

567
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,035
I'm glad you're being sensible.
You were beginning to worry me.

568
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,914
- From a medical standpoint.
- Thank you, Doctor.

569
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,875
I wish I could be of further assistance,

570
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,129
but fortunately you Southern people
have your own help.

571
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,068
Attention! Eyes front!

572
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,539
Rebs, sir!

573
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,627
Hopping that riverbank.
A full brigade, coming fast.

574
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,173
Horse, foot and artillery, sir.
It ain't militia, neither.

575
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,258
- How far?
- Ten minutes.

576
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,093
All right, get out of sight,
get in those trees.

577
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,312
Enemy patrol. Take cover and choke up.

578
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:00,066
- Bugler!
- Not bugler, you idiot! Hand signals.

579
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,323
Enemy across the river.
Move out. Keep it quiet.

580
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,201
Why doesn't he stand and fight?
He's got a full brigade.

581
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,688
♪ Hurrah! Hurrah!

586
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,129
Come on, stop it.

587
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,338
Hannah!

588
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,429
Hey! Help! Over here!

589
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,641
Ouch!

590
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,684
Let go with those teeth!

591
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,022
- I've got 800 men out there.
- Get some water.

592
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,208
Looks to be all clear across the river.

593
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,626
Well...

594
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:53,990
How many men does it take
to keep one lone female quiet?

595
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,754
Colonel, the prisoner
would like a word with you.

596
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,801
Yes, Miss Hunter?

597
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,013
I'm not here to complain
about what you did.

598
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,599
It was your duty as you saw it,
and you did it.

599
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,893
I'm sorry you had to break your word.

600
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:27,189
I gave my word not to run away. I didn't
give it not to cry out for assistance.

601
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,692
I suppose there's a fine point there,

602
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,486
but I have to ask you to give me
your word on that too.

603
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,865
I do that, here and now.

604
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:41,370
Or I suppose when I testify against you,
I'd be handicapped with a broken jaw.

605
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,040
I'd say so. Anything else, ma'am?

606
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,836
One slight item.
My constant companions there.

607
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,214
I don't know how it is up North,
of course, but down South

608
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,676
there are times when Southern women
feel the need for privacy.

609
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:58,971
You two.

610
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,227
We was respectful. Real respectful, sir.

611
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,645
You told us it was all right

612
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,773
just as long as we could see
the top of her head.

613
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,611
- You told them that?
- Well...

614
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,696
Then there's one more item.

615
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:27,625
I suggest you see a doctor.
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

616
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,558
Over there in that barn. Come on.

617
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,464
- We was bushwhacked, Colonel.
- All right, smoke 'em out.

618
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,056
Hold your fire.

619
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:34,066
Hey, there! We're Confederates,
but we ain't hostile.

620
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,571
- Honest!
- Drop your weapons and come on out.

621
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,115
Yes, sir.

622
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,199
Coming.

623
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,753
Hey, Virgil, come ahead on.

624
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,465
They's real bluebellies.

625
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,009
Watch it, Colonel.

626
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:06,056
Just the two of us, Cap.
And one captive.

627
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,946
Howdy, Cap. Jackie Jo and me is sorry
about popping away at you people.

628
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,699
We thought you was more
sheriff deputies coming to get us.

629
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,869
What have you got
against sheriff's deputies?

630
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,247
- That's a good one?
- That's a slick one.

631
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,750
We just love sheriff's deputies.

632
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:38,422
They're deserters from the
Confederacy, sir. The lowest swine bred.

633
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:43,052
- I take it you're the sheriff?
- Captain Henry Goodbody, retired.

634
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,721
Acting sheriff of Lorena County.

635
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,848
I was about to apprehend these rats...

636
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:52,353
But we bushwhacked you,
you old goat, didn't we?

637
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:57,483
That we did, Jackie Jo.
But tell them about us, Captain Goodyo.

638
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,573
- Don't you dare touch him again!
- Miss Hunter.

639
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:10,079
You! You call yourself a man?
Treating with that scum?

640
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,289
Miss Hunter, that man is our enemy.

641
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,335
One word from you of any kind
and he will be shot. Understand?

642
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,586
That's right, ma'am.

643
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,263
Can I help you, miss?

644
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,598
I'm perfectly quite capable
of getting on by myself.

645
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,688
Seems you need
a little attention. Doctor!

646
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,940
Will you look to our good friend's ear?

647
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,193
Sorry but I got a weak stomach.

648
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,696
Otis, see what you can do
for our new recruit.

649
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,910
Hard to explain a man, isn't it?

650
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,459
Take care of this man.

651
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,752
Gunshot wound, sir.

652
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,135
Hey! You aim to stick that thing
clear through to the other side?

653
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:10,306
I seriously doubt it would have met
with any obstruction.

654
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,309
Sergeant, give me a couple
of those good cigars.

655
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,103
Hey!

656
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:20,316
- Did it hurt you, Virgil?
- This will make you feel better.

657
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,320
We'll have a talk, fellas.
Did you come through Newton Station?

658
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,323
- Sure did.
- Any troops there?

659
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:31,160
Oh, not no more.
Now, the Alabama Sixth, it was there.

660
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,912
But it moved to Vicksburg
with the Georgia Tenth.

661
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,540
The Tenth was Virg and my's old outfit.

662
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,250
"Was" is right.

663
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,587
I guess there aren't any troops
within 30 or 40 miles.

664
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,423
- 60 at least.
- You vile traitors!

665
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,676
Vicksburg, you say?
That's where we're headed for.

666
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,304
Looks like we're in for a little fight.

667
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:55,059
- Thanks, fellas. Untie the sheriff.
- High on the hog, Virg?

668
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:59,938
Hey, looks like you Yankee boys
do all right with the women.

669
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:05,152
And that's a pretty
towheaded one you've got there.

670
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,154
- Hi.
- Howdy, missy.

671
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,991
- Hi, missy.
- See what I told you about up North?

672
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:15,204
- Sergeant, your gauntlets.
- A pleasure, sir.

673
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,168
Hi, missy. Hey, missy.

674
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,462
Remove the prisoner.

675
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:28,217
Are you going to shoot him personal,
Cap? Let Jackie Jo here do it.

676
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,552
He's the best dang shot I ever seen.

677
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,847
I once saw him shoot
a runaway negro slave woman...

678
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,392
right through the... eyes.

679
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,189
Tie 'em up.

680
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:56,161
Sheriff, I'll leave them in your hands.
Pistol. It's loaded.

681
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:02,167
With the compliments
of Miss Hannah Hunter of Greenbriar.

682
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,923
- Thank you, sir.
- You are welcome, sir.

683
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,552
Satisfied, Miss Hunter?

684
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:16,056
Well, your sense of justice
does surprise me a little.

685
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:20,769
Justice? Those men would
have been excess baggage.

686
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,189
I don't trust them any more
than I really trust...

687
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,859
- Than me?
- That's right.

688
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,701
Yes, ma'am. A hard man to understand.

689
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,529
- Hi there, girls!
- Yankees! Get out of here!

690
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,996
Get out, you dirty Yankees!
Get out of here!

691
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,617
- Jonathan!
- Miss Hunter. Sorry ma'am.

692
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,037
Mustn't talk to the prisoners.
We've got a nice room for you upstairs.

693
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:06,041
- A nice hot bath for you.
- You can change your clothes.

694
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,043
You see, we've got a lot of work to do.

695
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,630
- You're not going to burn the town?
- No. Just war supplies.

696
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,466
Cotton. Railway equipment.
Contraband, ma'am.

697
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,679
Contraband. That's me, ain't it?

698
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,272
Come on! Dismount!

699
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,779
- Neatly done, Richard.
- Thank you, sir.

700
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,574
- Is this the whole garrison?
- Every last man.

701
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,785
They gave up without a struggle,
like Caesar to Cleopatra.

702
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,955
Without a struggle?

703
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,668
Kirby, set up headquarters
in this hotel.

704
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,421
- It would be a pleasure, sir.
- And close the bar.

705
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:57,092
- Yes, sir.
- Shall we set about the day's work?

706
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:01,305
I'm going to love setting a torch
to this nest of rebels.

707
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,647
Prisoner!

708
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,193
- Rebel Colonel, sir.
- Yes, sir?

709
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:21,116
What is the contraband in the warehouses
and on those cars in the sidings?

710
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,287
The property of the Confederate States
of America is not contraband, sir.

711
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:26,955
Oh?

712
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,792
Well, let's look at it
from my side, Colonel.

713
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,921
- Jonathan! Jonny Miles.
- You know the Colonel?

714
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:39,092
Sure. We're old friends. Last time
we served together was fighting Indians.

715
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,805
Sorry about the arm.
When did that happen?

716
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,852
I want neither your solicitude
nor to recall our association.

717
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,021
Have I your permission to retire, sir?

718
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,900
Take him away.

719
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:08,705
I can't figure a man like Miles
giving up that easy.

720
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,333
He's West Point. Tough as nails.

721
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:14,544
Maybe losing that arm
took a lot out of him.

722
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,131
The man I knew could lose both arms
and still try to kick you to death.

723
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,216
Hoppy?

724
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:25,305
- Did you picket this whole area?
- Yes, sir.

725
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:31,395
Colonel!
There's a reb train coming in, sir.

726
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,815
- Secord! Woodward!
- Yo!

727
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,863
This bar's closed.

728
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:51,206
Well, it must be a supply train,
rolling right into our laps.

729
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:54,042
I never saw a supply train
without guards on it before.

730
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,504
Well, they wouldn't be too alert
in their own territory.

731
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,924
- Where was that reb Colonel?
- The telegraph office.

732
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,009
- Telegraph office?
- Yes, sir.

733
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,473
All right, Secord, you know what to do.

734
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,226
Get those horses under cover!

735
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:28,994
Get them wagons!

736
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,353
Get that bale off there.
Watch it!

737
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,796
Down, out of sight.

738
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,005
Cover from inside.

739
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,974
- Sir?
- No, I don't need it.

740
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,271
- Everyone's ready for action, sir.
- Thank you.

741
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,017
Fire!

742
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,362
I didn't want this.
I tried to avoid a fight.

743
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,239
That's why I took up medicine.

744
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,668
- Look at that idiot!
- Jonny! Jonny Miles!

745
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,752
Cease fire!

746
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,061
- All right, move him up.
- Move this man up.

747
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,900
Let me be of assistance.
I'm a physician. Dr. Marvin.

748
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,319
Major Kendall. We appreciate your help.

749
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,572
This man is next.

750
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,921
Go get some air.

751
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,758
- I can help.
- Get out.

752
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,602
Get him out of here.

753
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,584
Lou, you go and get some ice.
All you can find.

754
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,294
You too. You help him. Quick.

755
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,562
How long are you going to be, Kendall?

756
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,897
Take a look for yourself.
We just started.

757
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,943
- I need a definite answer.
- I can't give you one.

758
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,904
I've got a job to do too, you know.

759
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,199
At least five hours.

760
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,329
Colonel. Hey, Colonel.

761
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,586
Hello, trooper.

762
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,922
I'm Hoskins. Bud Hoskins.

763
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,340
K Company, sir.

764
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,178
- You don't know me.
- Sure I know you.

765
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,723
Good soldier. You just lie easy, son.

766
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,018
I put my hand on there and it's all...

767
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,521
Just lie still.

768
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,527
You'll write my ma, Colonel?
She'd love it if you...

769
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,989
You'll be writing her yourself
before long.

770
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,408
No.

771
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,911
No, I know.

772
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:11,331
- And I'm scared, Colonel.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

773
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,586
No, I'm all right.

774
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,129
Just hold onto me, sir.

775
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,216
And write my ma.

776
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,636
I'll be in your debt forever.

777
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,238
Aren't you proud?

778
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,951
Yes, I'm very proud of that boy.

779
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,044
- Report.
- Three dead, 18 wounded.

780
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:02,423
Demolition proceeding as ordered, sir.
And the bar is closed.

781
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,259
The bar is open!

782
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,117
- Get some laudanum.
- There is no more, sir.

783
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,633
Come down out of there, buster,
unless you want to go up with it.

784
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,821
Well, John, there goes half a million
dollars of railroad equipment.

785
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:10,575
That's how I made my living, you know.
Building railroads.

786
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:19,459
The railroad's finished for eight miles!
North and south...

787
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,759
John, what are you doing? Wait a minute!

788
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,845
- John!
- Get out!

789
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,556
- You figure this is a hospital?
- Listen to me.

790
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,018
And I can do it to Colonels, too!
Get out of here.

791
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:59,957
When we move out, give your people,
the wounded, a lot of liquor.

792
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,836
I'd do that anyway.

793
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,656
Here, take this.

794
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,991
It will steady you down.

795
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,419
I've never seen it this way before.

796
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,757
I was with my father when he died.

797
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,302
But he died peacefully.

798
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,307
- Without pain.
- Well, it was lucky.

799
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,227
For both of you.

800
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:06,524
Go ahead, Kendall! Have a field day!

801
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,818
What do you mean, field day?

802
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,028
He's fighting to save men's lives.

803
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,449
Men's lives?
Or the reputation of his profession?

804
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,829
- You can't be serious, Colonel Marlowe.
- Have it your way, ma'am.

805
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:27,378
- Medicine is the most noble...
- Sure, noble profession, noble oath.

806
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,797
Lanterns held on high.

807
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,301
So high they won't admit
they're groping for...

808
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:38,431
You're...

809
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,603
- You're unfair and...
- Unfair?

810
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:50,276
There was a girl not much older
than that boy in there.

811
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,321
I wasn't unfair then, understand?

812
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:59,744
Because they used a lot of fancy words
that a section hand wouldn't understand.

813
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,081
So I held her down
while two of 'em worked on her.

814
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,252
I trusted doctors then. Believed in 'em.

815
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,923
Because I was in love
and I didn't want to see her die.

816
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,887
A tumor, they said it was.

817
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,722
And it had to come out right away.

818
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:25,186
So they stuck a leather strap in her
mouth so she could bite off her screams

819
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,022
while they cut away to get in there.

820
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,775
And what did they find? Nothing!

821
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,905
Oh, they were sorry.
Sure, they'd made a mistake.

822
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:39,450
They had something to talk about
before their next experiment.

823
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,788
But what about me?
They left me begging her not to die.

824
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,956
And I lost my wife.

825
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,003
I didn't kill either one of them.

826
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:56,008
I must have been crazy,
or too conventional.

827
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,307
Quite a speech.
I guess I'm feeling my liquor.

828
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,259
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

829
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,186
Thanks, Hank.

830
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,861
- Well, we almost fooled you.
- Almost.

831
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:02,408
You'll never make it, Hank.
They're already closing in on you.

832
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,369
Bedford Forest
is sniffing at your heels.

833
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:09,498
You're headed straight
for that prison at Andersonville.

834
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,792
There's nothing we can do
to help you there, Hank.

835
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,711
The South is starving.

836
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,007
Jonathan, all I'm doing
is practicing medicine.

837
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:20,009
Old ironhead does all the thinking.

838
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:24,013
He thinks things pretty good.
West Point?

839
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,515
No, section hand.

840
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:32,313
- How are Susan and the kids?
- They're fine.

841
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,483
In Vicksburg.
I expect you'll be seeing them soon.

842
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:40,780
Nice try, Jonathan. Nice try.

843
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,410
See you in Vicksburg, Hoppy.

844
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,046
- Goodbye, Hoppy.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

845
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:01,592
I want to thank you
for all I've learned.

846
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,096
I shall endeavor
to get home alive as many as I can.

847
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,932
You're a good man, Hoppy.

848
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,852
After this thing is all over,
if we don't meet again,

849
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,729
be sure and finish medical school.

850
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,774
I shall make a point of it, sir.

851
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,409
Goodbye, Doctor. And good luck.

852
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,536
Thank you, Doctor, for all your help.

853
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:49,640
Vicksburg. They're headed
southwest to Baton Rouge.

854
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:51,892
Baton Rouge.

855
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,688
It's Baton Rouge, Major.
Tell General Forest.

856
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,913
Yes, you can.
I'm on the board of inquiry.

857
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,082
I know exactly what can be done.

858
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,334
Now, he has no right, even as a...

859
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,343
- Phil...
- Yes, John?

860
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,764
I'm sorry about what happened
back at Newton Station.

861
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:33,851
Forget it, John.
You were under a strain.

862
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:37,521
But since you brought up the subject...

863
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,107
You know, John,
I'm an older man than you are.

864
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,193
What's more, I'm a politician.

865
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,779
We've knocked over Newton Station.

866
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,865
It's a glorious thing on my...
our records.

867
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:51,911
But now is the time to head north,
back to La Grange...

868
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,413
We're committed, Phil, and that's that.

869
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,626
Stubborn. Stubborn!

870
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,131
Ouch.

871
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,383
Can I have some of that liquor
to swallow, Doc?

872
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,638
You haven't got a good enough excuse.
How'd this happen, Dunker?

873
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:15,768
I was chopping down one of them
telegraph poles back there in Newton.

874
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,813
The axe ricocheted right onto my leg.

875
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,233
- Go arrest the axe.
- It ain't nothing.

876
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:27,905
Nothing? Almost blood poisoning.
You're lucky I saw you limping.

877
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,323
Aw, Doc...

878
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:33,619
What are you putting on there? Dirt?

879
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:40,125
No. Tree moss. Ordinary green mold.

880
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,379
It has some sort of healing agent,
I imagine.

881
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:47,716
- You imagine?
- I don't imagine the results, Colonel.

882
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,177
This is an old Cheyenne Indian cure.

883
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,933
Cheyenne Indian cure!

884
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,687
Green mold! Tree moss!

885
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:08,404
You keep this on.
Report any soreness to me.

886
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,043
Lukey!

887
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:25,272
- What for they shoot me, Miss Hannah?
- It's all right.

888
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:32,655
Get my bag.

889
01:22:55,971 --> 01:23:00,057
- She's gone, ma'am.
- Oh, no.

890
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,824
Are you all right, Miss Hannah?

891
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,411
I brought you
a little bitty piece of candle.

892
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,163
We'll have some hot water
for you in the morning.

893
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:29,086
And lookee here. I found
a piece of looking glass for you.

894
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,265
Thank you.

895
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:00,951
I hope you'll... be able
to get some rest here.

896
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:10,544
You must know how we feel,
ma'am, about Lukey.

897
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,216
How much we regret...

898
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,136
how sorry I am...

899
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,556
that in some way we were the cause of...

900
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,476
Lukey isn't asking for that.

901
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,478
I wish I could let you go.

902
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,065
If I gave you a horse
and turned you loose,

903
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:36,528
would you promise not to tell anybody
our plans for the next 24 hours?

904
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,155
It's too late.

905
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,617
It's too late for all of that.

906
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,622
No more promises.

907
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,002
No more anything now.

908
01:24:56,174 --> 01:25:01,011
I'm sorry. Truly sorry.

909
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:12,731
Dunker.

910
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,784
- That leg was all right yesterday.
- Yes, but this morning it got swolled.

911
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:27,079
- I had to tear my trouser leg.
- Where's the poultice?

912
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:31,458
It started into itching, sir,
so I just yanked her off.

913
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,961
It was a sign it was
beginning to heal, you fool.

914
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:38,841
Come in here, or you're in trouble.

915
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,343
Brown, lend a hand.

916
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:45,055
Over there.

917
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,978
- Coffee?
- Thanks.

918
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,148
Report.

919
01:25:56,401 --> 01:26:01,321
That's Salt Springs, all right, sir.
Nary a soldier inside, neither.

920
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,366
Just some old women,
a couple of salt mills

921
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,201
and a school for little boys.

922
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:10,706
- The salt mills will need burning.
- Why show ourselves? We've been lucky.

923
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,749
You call that coffee?

924
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,629
We can't pass 'em up.
Salt is as valuable as ammunition.

925
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:21,008
We'll bivouac here
and hit them in the morning.

926
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:23,093
All right, you're the boss.

927
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:32,394
♪ Hi-ho, down we go
There ain't no such word as "can't"...

928
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:37,774
- What's going on?
- The doctor's working on Dunker's leg.

929
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:48,327
♪ I left my love
My love I left...

930
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:49,536
Take another pull.

931
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:57,628
That's good store liquor, Doc.
Who hit John?

932
01:26:57,712 --> 01:27:00,464
- I've got to take it off, Dunker.
- What did you say?

933
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,508
I've got to take your leg off.

934
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,721
You've got to what?

935
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:10,724
The poison's gone too far.
You'll be dead by morning.

936
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:19,900
What can come of me after that, Doc?
One leg? What can come of me after that?

937
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:24,488
I'll rig a sling and leave you
with the closest civilian care.

938
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,365
Civilian care?

939
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:29,743
Then comes prison next?
Andersonville?

940
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,871
Is that what happens to me, Doc?!
Andersonville?!

941
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:36,208
- Quite possibly.
- Yeah.

942
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:40,170
That's a hell of a tough choice
for a fella to have to make.

943
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:45,342
- Ain't it? Well, tell me. Ain't it?
- It's got to come off.

944
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:49,346
All right.

945
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,724
You just fire away.

946
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:55,644
But before you start sawing,

947
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:58,397
you give me some of that
chloroform stuff.

948
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,358
- You put me out, Doc.
- I'll give you what I got.

949
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,708
Now bite this.
Give me a hand here. Hold him down.

950
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,346
God... God!

951
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:44,568
It's obviously the column
that raided Newton Station.

952
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,820
That Vicksburg report was just a faint.

953
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,365
I thought a brigade of cavalry
was due here to reinforce your battery.

954
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,992
They won't get here
till late today, sir.

955
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:55,078
If what you suggest is most extreme.

956
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,166
- My oldest boy here is only 16.
- Damn it, sir!

957
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,753
I beg your pardon, Colonel.
I mean, Reverend...

958
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,673
Look, I've got a boy in my battery
that's 14, a man that's 72.

959
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,342
This is a war, sir.

960
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:12,095
I could start lobbing shrapnel and grape
at them critters, catch 'em napping.

961
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,766
Just a little show of force, sir

962
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:18,477
then maybe, perhaps we can hold them off
until the cavalry gets here.

963
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:21,897
- Cadet Major Barksdale.
- Sir?

964
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:24,066
- Assemble your battalion.
- Every man, sir?

965
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:28,028
- The entire complement.
- Taylor and Fitcher have the mumps.

966
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:33,533
Scratch them from the duty roster.
Well, you heard the Lieutenant.

967
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,453
You'll be pleased to inform the corps
we shall move at dawn.

968
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,038
Thank you, sir!

969
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,854
Attention!

970
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:15,283
Cadet Major Barksdale, you may move
your column forward. And God bless you.

971
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,371
Right shoulder, arms!

972
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,918
Right, face!

973
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:31,049
Cadets, forward march!

974
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:46,082
Reverend, my boy Johnny.
He's all I've got left.

975
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:51,463
First his pa, then his uncles,
his brothers. Now him?

976
01:31:51,547 --> 01:31:57,010
He's all I have left, Reverend.
I'm not going to let him go.

977
01:31:57,094 --> 01:32:00,305
Cadet drummer Buford,
you are relieved of duty.

978
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:48,270
I'd save a little of that for Dunker.

979
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,981
I just lost him.

980
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:56,653
You lost Dunker?

981
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:00,115
Well, you lost us a good man.

982
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:03,910
Blood poisoning. Amputation.
A shock to the heart, I guess.

983
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,704
I wouldn't have had to amputate
if he'd...

984
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:08,164
If, maybe, perhaps.

985
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:11,835
- What's the matter, medicine man?
- Section hand, I've had you!

986
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,503
Strip your blouse!

987
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,765
I think you're right. Come on.

988
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:29,644
Orderly! Horses! Bring 'em up!

989
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:42,991
Johnny!

990
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,077
Johnny Buford!

991
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:48,413
Johnny!

992
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:11,269
- What are the rules, Colonel?
- Just make up your own.

993
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:20,236
You said no rules, Colonel.

994
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,326
On your feet, croaker.

995
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,583
Fire Peter!

996
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,596
Fire Paul!

997
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:01,444
Fire Paul!

998
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:10,495
Artillery fire, sir. Hidden battery.

999
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:27,220
Those are nothing but children.
They're schoolboys.

1000
01:35:27,304 --> 01:35:30,682
Just some kids
from the military school.

1001
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,100
Yeah, but they keep coming.

1002
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,652
Sound assembly.

1003
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:02,464
Well, at least that
Holy Joe ain't no kid.

1004
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:28,364
Halt! Front rank, kneel!

1005
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,576
- Ready!
- Miss Hunter...

1006
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:34,704
Aim! Fire!

1007
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,631
Rear rank, halt!

1008
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,050
Kneel!

1009
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:51,387
Ready! Aim! Fire!

1010
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,938
What do you want to do?
Set up a field hospital?

1011
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,981
Yes, Mr. Colonel Marlowe,
what are you going to do now?

1012
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,150
With all due respect
to your presence, ma'am,

1013
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,319
I'm going to get
the hell out of here. Bugler!

1014
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:07,904
Sound recall!

1015
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,410
I told you to take care of this woman!

1016
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:22,001
Hey Colonel, I got me a prisoner.
What do you want me to do with him?

1017
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:25,213
- Spank him.
- On the bottom?

1018
01:37:25,297 --> 01:37:26,714
Where do you think?

1019
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,884
- Halt!
- Hold it, Colonel.

1020
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:22,395
- Report.
- Rebs. They got the whole road blocked.

1021
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,315
- How many?
- A full regiment of regulars, sir.

1022
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:28,776
They got two pieces of artillery
and they're digging in along the road.

1023
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:38,912
The only thing to do is fight our way
back to Salt Springs and head east.

1024
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:43,833
- Haven't you seen that dust?
- Cavalry. Following us for three hours.

1025
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:50,131
Colonel, the deacon says he knows this
country real good. Don't you, Deacon?

1026
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:51,591
Preaching the gospel,

1027
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:55,053
singing the praises of the Lord
hereabouts for years.

1028
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,889
It might be a good idea
to start praying right now.

1029
01:38:57,973 --> 01:39:02,477
The deacon smuggled runaway slaves
north out of here through the swamp.

1030
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:08,441
- With the underground railway.
- Could you smuggle us out south?

1031
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:11,194
Wait a minute John. Wait a minute.

1032
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,821
Why, that swamp is full
of quicksand, cotton mouth, rattlers...

1033
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:17,200
The Garden of Eden
had its sufferance too.

1034
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:20,286
Follow me, brother Colonel,
through the swamps

1035
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:25,875
all the way to the river Amite.
Lead kindly, Lord.

1036
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,336
All right, get yourself
a couple of fresh horses.

1037
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:34,425
By the right flank, take cover.

1038
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:55,196
Come on!

1039
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,066
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1040
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,238
Move out. Come on, boy.

1041
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:23,534
Come on, boy.

1042
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:27,580
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on!

1043
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:34,545
Keep moving. Stay awake there, kid.

1044
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,799
Keep moving. Pick up your feet.

1045
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:41,552
John, how far do you figure
to Baton Rouge?

1046
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,221
40 miles.

1047
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,056
Keep alive in there!

1048
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:48,601
- You want me to apologize now or later?
- For what?

1049
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:52,063
- Keep moving!
- I never thought you could do it.

1050
01:41:52,147 --> 01:41:57,026
You know, John, I've given up
all thought of running for Congress.

1051
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,488
With this on my record,
by George, I can be Governor.

1052
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:02,657
- Keep moving!
- Governor of Michigan.

1053
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:05,201
- Stay alive!
- And you can name your own job.

1054
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:06,285
Railroad commissioner...

1055
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:10,164
I wouldn't start making
campaign promises till we get there.

1056
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,457
Join your regiment.

1057
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,586
Colonel, my duty, medically speaking,
is to inform you that

1058
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:18,464
some of these men may make it
on their hands and knees.

1059
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:21,884
We've been 20 hours without a stop.
We need a rest.

1060
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,845
I've got eyes, Kendall.

1061
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:27,306
It's also my duty to inform you
that if we run into a fight...

1062
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,101
That is all, Doctor.

1063
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,978
Thank you, sir.

1064
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:05,928
- Column, halt!
- Column, halt!

1065
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:13,311
- Woodward.
- Yo!

1066
01:43:14,646 --> 01:43:17,273
First squad,
scout the other side of the bridge.

1067
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:20,818
First squad, forward, yo!

1068
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,216
I don't know if you've heard.

1069
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,720
Your people are about an hour
behind us, coming fast.

1070
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:49,096
I've heard.

1071
01:43:50,807 --> 01:43:55,228
We're going on to Baton Rouge.
We'll leave you here.

1072
01:43:56,855 --> 01:43:58,940
Your own kind can take care of you.

1073
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:02,985
- I'm sure they can.
- Yes.

1074
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:07,531
I...

1075
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:14,080
I'm sorry for the hardship and...

1076
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:18,292
the humiliation that we've...

1077
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:20,378
that I've caused you.

1078
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,516
Get her out of here!

1079
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,189
Recall!

1080
01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:46,237
Get her in that cabin!

1081
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:55,496
Come on, Miss Hannah.

1082
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:09,385
Looks like they've got us in a trap.

1083
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:15,975
Knock on it!

1084
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,318
Give us some cover!

1085
01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:38,456
Captain Woodward, move!

1086
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:52,053
Leave me alone.

1087
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:56,057
I'm all right. Let me alone, would you?

1088
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,361
Easy.

1089
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:12,782
Get Colonel Secord right away.
Not that way, the other door.

1090
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,034
- Report.
- It's alive with rebs, sir.

1091
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:17,203
And I seen at least two cannons.

1092
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:20,289
- They jumped us so quick.
- Infantry?

1093
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,874
- The wood's full of 'em.
- Join your troop.

1094
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:23,334
Yes sir.

1095
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:26,045
- Cut his boot off, Sam.
- Nobody's cutting that boot off.

1096
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:27,713
- I got a lot of work to do.
- Cut his boot off.

1097
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:34,637
Take a good stiff jolt.

1098
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:40,601
Those are $20 boots, trooper.

1099
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,858
- Get some water.
- Who, me?

1100
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:58,452
Take A-troop and that reverend,
or whatever he is.

1101
01:46:58,995 --> 01:47:03,791
Find a ford someway across that river.
Flank 'em. Take a bugler with you.

1102
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:07,461
Yes sir. Thank you for the opportunity.

1103
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:54,717
John, we've ridden right into a trap.
They want us to cross that bridge.

1104
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:57,136
It'd be like going through a funnel.

1105
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,805
We've accomplished our purpose, John.

1106
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:04,268
In a position like this, there's nothing
disgraceful about honorable surrender.

1107
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:08,272
Get back to your troop.
Keep 'em under cover.

1108
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:12,818
- You mean... you're going on?
- Get out of here!

1109
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:16,572
You're not going far
with that bullet in you.

1110
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:21,827
You're taking your own sweet time
about cutting it out of there.

1111
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,663
You're not the only wounded man
here, Colonel. Get me my bag.

1112
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,958
Now, this is going to hurt a little.

1113
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,129
Go on with it, Kendall.

1114
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:35,758
Keep that leg stretched.

1115
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:39,762
Probe, please.

1116
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:10,292
Are you having fun?

1117
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:19,301
You're lucky.

1118
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:29,812
You may not believe it, Colonel,
but I bought you some time.

1119
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:35,985
- A couple of hours?
- Maybe more.

1120
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:38,112
Thanks.

1121
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:54,003
- First Michigan in position, sir.
- First Illinois in position.

1122
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:56,005
We were in position first.

1123
01:49:58,216 --> 01:49:59,216
I'm all right.

1124
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:09,893
Get cracking.

1125
01:50:33,376 --> 01:50:36,337
God Almighty. Here he comes.

1126
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:41,717
Mount up.

1127
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:46,013
You heard me, Kirby. Mount up.

1128
01:50:46,097 --> 01:50:49,224
You heard the Colonel! Mount up!

1129
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:08,619
Colonel.

1130
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:13,666
The deacon found a place to ford.
The men ought to be in position by now.

1131
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:19,046
Thanks. Cover our rear.
See how much time we've got.

1132
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:20,130
Yes, sir.

1133
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:38,649
- Where's your horse?
- Back in the swamp, sir.

1134
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:45,072
- Lips dry?
- Yes, sir. But my bugle ain't.

1135
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:52,621
- Uncase the colors.
- You heard him.

1136
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:05,843
You know your orders?

1137
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:09,012
John, You're not fit.
Let me lead this charge.

1138
01:52:09,097 --> 01:52:12,725
With a success like this,
I could land in the White House.

1139
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,643
We'll probably all land in the...

1140
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,021
Get back to your regiment!

1141
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:21,567
Bugler, sound charge!

1142
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:45,424
Forwards! Fire Paul.

1143
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:56,602
Company!

1144
01:54:04,754 --> 01:54:06,755
You're hurt, sir.

1145
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,591
Blow... Trumpet, blow.

1146
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:30,404
They can't give up.

1147
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:35,033
Maybe it's crazy, maybe it's brave.
Don't ask me to explain it. Nobody can.

1148
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,536
Come on, we're going to have
a lot of work to do.

1149
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:49,756
Bugler, sound recall.

1150
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,686
Got any more?

1151
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,108
Come on, give us some more.

1152
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:19,244
How much longer, Sergeant?
Sergeant Major.

1153
01:55:19,329 --> 01:55:20,537
Pretty near ready, sir.

1154
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:23,290
All right, boys! Hurry it up! Lay it in!

1155
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:25,042
Knock on it! Knock on it!

1156
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:39,890
Come on out! Get out of there!

1157
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:46,772
- Can those men be moved?
- They're all critical.

1158
01:55:46,856 --> 01:55:49,441
- May I speak to them?
- I'd rather you didn't.

1159
01:55:49,525 --> 01:55:51,735
They've got to be quiet.
I've given them all the laudanum I have.

1160
01:55:52,737 --> 01:55:55,530
It's a lousy finish for good men.

1161
01:55:57,033 --> 01:56:00,077
There'll be a medic with that
reb column. Get your horse.

1162
01:56:00,161 --> 01:56:02,162
I can't count on that.

1163
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,123
You mean you're staying?

1164
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:08,627
- Medicine's where you find it.
- Even in Andersonville?

1165
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:10,504
Even in Andersonville.

1166
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:17,302
I wouldn't blame you
if you slap it away. Shake hands?

1167
01:56:19,013 --> 01:56:23,266
- Doctor, Major Gray.
- All right, coming.

1168
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:25,727
When your next doctor
takes that bandage off...

1169
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,813
Yeah, I know. Tree moss.

1170
01:56:28,272 --> 01:56:29,731
So long, croaker.

1171
01:56:30,858 --> 01:56:32,401
Take care, section hand.

1172
01:56:58,886 --> 01:57:02,931
You're tired. You've helped a lot.
Thanks for it.

1173
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:09,104
A poor way of being grateful
after what I've put you through.

1174
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:15,277
- You'd better be going.
- Yes, I guess I'd better.

1175
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:19,364
Look, Hannah Hunter.

1176
01:57:21,242 --> 01:57:25,162
Thank God I won't be the cause
of hurting you any more.

1177
01:57:25,246 --> 01:57:28,123
Because it happens I'm in love with you.

1178
01:57:32,962 --> 01:57:35,005
Tell her the rest when you get back.

1179
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:12,209
- One of your own, sir.
- Get going.

1180
01:58:12,293 --> 01:58:14,002
Colonel, they're right on my tail.

1181
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,533
Let's go. Yah!

1182
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:22,070
Doctor, could our regimental surgeon
be of any service to you?

1183
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:23,738
I'd be grateful.

1184
01:59:24,138 --> 01:59:24,738
