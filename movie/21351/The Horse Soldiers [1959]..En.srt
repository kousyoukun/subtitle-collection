1
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,494
I left my love, my love I left

2
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,830
A-sleeping in her bed

3
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:05,334
I turned my back on my true love

4
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,003
Went fighting Johnny Reb

5
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:11,882
I left my love a letter

6
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:15,844
In the holler of a tree

7
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:18,722
I told her she would find me

8
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,226
In the US Cavalry

9
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:24,645
Hi-ho, down they go

10
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,481
There's no such word as "can't"

11
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:31,193
We'll ride clean down to hell and back

12
00:01:31,318 --> 00:01:34,531
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

13
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:36,991
Hi-ho, down they go

14
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:39,661
There's no such word as "can't"

15
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:43,456
We'll ride clean down to hell and back

16
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:46,751
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

17
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,254
I left my love, my love I left

18
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,425
A-sleeping in her bed

19
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,219
I turned my back on my true love

20
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:59,431
Went fighting Johnny Reb

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,684
I left my love a letter

22
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:07,272
In the holler of a tree

23
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:09,607
I told her she would find me

24
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:12,277
In the US Cavalry

25
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:15,780
In the US Cavalry

26
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,158
Hi-ho, down they go

27
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:20,910
There's no such word as "can't"

28
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:25,415
We'll ride clean down to New Orleans

29
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:31,546
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

30
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,429
General Hurlburt, by appointment.

31
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,186
- General Hurlburt and Colonel Marlowe.
- Steve, come in.

32
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:47,855
Hello, Sam. Colonel Marlowe.

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,484
(exchange of greetings)

34
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,737
- General Sherman, Colonel Marlowe.
- How do you do?

35
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,948
Marlowe, I've been anxious to meet you.

36
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,119
- It's a privilege, sir.
- Sit down.

37
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:07,792
- Is this your first look at Vicksburg?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:13,130
We've been looking at it
for ten months, and we don't like it.

39
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:18,511
Colonel, for your benefit, the war
on our side hasn't been going well at all.

40
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:23,808
Not in Washington,
not in the newspapers, not in the field.

41
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:27,853
To put it mildly, with less men
and less resources,

42
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:31,148
the South has whipped us to a standstill.

43
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:33,317
(cannon fire)

44
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:37,071
Now, if I could take Vicksburg...

45
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:43,702
the whole picture would change,
but I'd have to do it this summer.

46
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,080
Or sit out here another year.

47
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:50,918
Which might cost us 100,000 men.
It might cost us a war.

48
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:57,467
Which brings this talk to their main source
of supply - and a thorn in our side.

49
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:59,636
- Newton Station.
- Sam.

50
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:04,099
Marlowe has worked out the details
of your plan pretty thoroughly.

51
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,854
If I could get back to La Grange
right away, we could leave by Thursday.

52
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,857
Good. Who would your people be?

53
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:16,403
My own First Illinois with Secord's
First Michigan and Second lowa.

54
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,738
We'd be culled down to a short brigade.

55
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:24,119
Cross at La Grange, down through Ripley,
New Albany, Houston...

56
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:28,957
- Is there something wrong, sir?
- I know the map. Proceed.

57
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:33,712
Anyway, the main trick is
no fighting until we hit Newton Station.

58
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:36,256
How much track do you figure to destroy?

59
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:41,261
As much as I can. At least enough
to keep them busy for a couple of months.

60
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:45,849
Otherwise, the raid would
just be another horse ride.

61
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:52,773
All right, Colonel, go ahead. All the rails,
ties, buildings, bridges, rolling stock.

62
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,984
Sam, even if he should
get through to Newton Station,

63
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:59,196
he'd be 300 miles dead centre
in the Confederacy.

64
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,284
- Have you thought how you'd get back?
- Have you, sir?

65
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:07,163
Well, I guess I asked for that.

66
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:10,958
But I hate to think of you sitting it out
in Andersonville Prison.

67
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:15,129
- It's a hellhole.
- I'd think about that twice, too, sir.

68
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:18,341
Well, Colonel, your success.

69
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:27,225
THE UNION CAVALRY DEPOT
AT LA GRANGE, TENNESSEE

70
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:39,904
All right, here is La Grange.

71
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:45,576
- We will make 35 miles a day, average.
- 35?

72
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,454
35? Isn't that stretching it a bit?

73
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:52,416
It will be the first day, Ned.
I intend to make twice that distance.

74
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:55,628
In an operation like this,
everything is stretched.

75
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,797
Now, just hold on a minute, John.

76
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,925
Cutting the men's rations
from five days to three...

77
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,596
They'll have to live off the land eventually.
They might as well get used to it.

78
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:10,893
They seem excited. There's a rumour
they're headed for Nashville and a parade.

79
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:14,939
That was a good rumour to spread,
with the help of the Sergeant Major.

80
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:18,152
- Thank you, sir.
- And, gentlemen,

81
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,572
I'll have to admit they had me fooled too.

82
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:26,827
You see, I was going to use my leave
to do a little electioneering back home.

83
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:30,497
You know, shake a few hands,
kiss a few babies.

84
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:33,709
You see, I'm running for Congress this fall.

85
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:37,755
Well, there's 30,000 votes
at Andersonville, Phil.

86
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,091
I hope you don't get to shake
any of their hands.

87
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,264
Leaves are being cancelled,
orders to reshoe the whole blasted outfit,

88
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,767
and some of them shoes
ain't even shiny yet.

89
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,560
Yep.

90
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:58,275
I'm trying to figure out what's up. They've
been sitting under that tree all morning.

91
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,781
I heard some scuttlebutt about us being
pulled out for a big parade up North.

92
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:07,910
- I figure we're heading for Nashville.
- That's to my liking.

93
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:12,289
A parade, and then leave.
Now this war is starting to shape up.

94
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,632
- Where's the officers' conference?
- Over under that tree yonder, sir.

95
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,801
Thank you.

96
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,608
- My apologies for being late.
- Understood.

97
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:42,153
- Sit down, Major.
- I don't believe I know the Major.

98
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:45,740
I'm sorry.
Colonel Marlowe, Major Kendall.

99
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,700
- How do you do?
- Glad to know you.

100
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:52,038
Major Kendall has just been
assigned to us by General Grant.

101
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:56,751
The Major seems to be out of uniform.
Where are your side arms, Kendall?

102
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,172
If you look in the book, you'll see
a surgeon doesn't carry them.

103
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,180
Surgeon? You cut out our artillery and
our wagons. Nothing to slow us down.

104
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:12,475
And now you saddle us
with a doctor and a medical unit?

105
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,979
Regulations, John. Kendall goes along.

106
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:18,273
Very well, sir. Any questions?

107
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:22,026
- All I can say is I'm glad for some action.
- No glory hunting.

108
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:27,031
If anything knocks this into a cocked hat,
it'll be a firefight. Is that all, sir?

109
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:31,286
- Logan, is Brady ready?
- Oh, a photograph.

110
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,206
Move away. Move back.

111
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:38,085
Are you ready for us, Brady?

112
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,632
Colonel. Sit down, Colonel.

113
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,011
- Thank you very much.
- That's all right.

114
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:51,265
- Sit down, Marlowe.
- No hats, please, gentlemen.

115
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:56,061
That's right. Nice and relaxed.

116
00:08:56,979 --> 00:09:02,276
Now, roses are red, violets are blue,
the camera's looking straight at you.

117
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,905
Oh, I must have another one.
That man in the white coat moved.

118
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,909
That isn't all he'll be moving before long.
General, is that all?

119
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:13,662
That's all, gentlemen.
Thank you, Brady.

120
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:17,291
Thank you, General.
Thank you very much.

121
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:22,296
Sit down.

122
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:26,383
Colonel, I gather you're not too happy
about my going along.

123
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,386
I hadn't counted on you, that's all.

124
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:34,308
I can understand your reasons for
trying to avoid a fight, tactically speaking.

125
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,561
But you're going very deep
into enemy territory.

126
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,898
Tell me, what did you intend to do
about your wounded?

127
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:43,859
I intend to move, and move fast.

128
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:48,239
Those too badly shot up to carry on
will be left to the clemency of the enemy.

129
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:51,952
- Civilian or military.
- Including yourself?

130
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,121
Naturally.

131
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,292
That's a pretty primitive attitude.
Medically speaking.

132
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:04,047
Well, Doctor,
war isn't exactly a civilised business.

133
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:09,761
Of course, I realise that it gives you fellas
a wider field of opportunity...

134
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:13,181
- For experimenting, Colonel?
- I didn't say that.

135
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:15,058
- Mitch.
- Yes, sir?

136
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:18,812
- Give the doctor a full roster.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,856
Examine every man.

138
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:26,528
Throw out any man who - in your
unchallenged opinion, of course - is unfit.

139
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:31,324
Even those who might get sick
a week from today.

140
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,286
Look, I didn't ask
to be assigned to this mission.

141
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm a military doctor. I've been ordered
to go and I'm going to do my job.

142
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:40,917
So get off my back.

143
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:51,678
- Bugler!
- Yes, sir?

144
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:56,475
- Get me Mitchell.
- Sergeant Major Mitchell's in the hospital.

145
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,615
- How old are you?
- 32, sir.

146
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:14,452
Join that group.

147
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,212
Hang on, son. Here we go.

148
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:27,840
(yells)

149
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:32,261
(metal clanks)

150
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:35,473
This is going to hurt worse.

151
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,858
There. He'll be all right.

152
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,699
- I got your sick list, Kendall.
- Good. I'm glad it's a short one.

153
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,660
We'll let that drain full out.

154
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:58,663
- I approve of that, Doctor.
- The lad had quite a boil.

155
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:02,041
I didn't come here to watch you
carving anybody's behind.

156
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,504
- Why's Mitchell's name on that list?
- Sir, we observe quiet here.

157
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,132
- What's this?
- Hoppy, this is Colonel Marlowe.

158
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:14,221
How do you do? Stand in line.
We'll take care of you presently.

159
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:17,433
- Is he going with us?
- He's a good man. I need him.

160
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:22,729
- I need Mitchell. He's strong as a bull.
- Let me show you something.

161
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:32,114
Colonel, I've been trying to tell the doctor
that this is nothing unusual.

162
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,700
Not for a man with malaria.

163
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:37,578
There's nothing new about this, Kendall.

164
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,081
I've seen him ride 40 miles
in one day, shivering.

165
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:44,501
- He always gets malaria.
- So you concur in my diagnosis.

166
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:46,962
Mitch, get out of bed. I got some whiskey.

167
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,214
You stay where you are, Sergeant.

168
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:55,179
I was ordered to take off the duty roster
any man who in my opinion was unfit.

169
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:58,682
He's sick and he's going to stay here.
Those are my orders.

170
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:02,311
You've read the whole book, haven't you?

171
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,774
(kicks buckets)

172
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:10,736
Oh, Colonel!

173
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,655
We got that fella
with all them stripes for you.

174
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:18,368
- Bring him in.
- We hauled him right off the train.

175
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:21,163
- Sergeant Kirby reporting, sir.
- Well, Kirby.

176
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:24,167
Besides being drunk,
what's got you riled up?

177
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,711
They got me in town.
Pulled me off the train.

178
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,172
Just gotten filled. My first in two years.

179
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:32,175
They tell me you're good. You better be.

180
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,428
You're replacing the best soldier
in the regiment.

181
00:13:35,553 --> 00:13:40,350
- I expect you to be happy about that.
- I could be happier where I was going.

182
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:43,353
- You got me there.
- No, sir, you got me here.

183
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:45,730
- Sir.
- Sir.

184
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,817
March this sergeant
to the river and throw him in.

185
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:50,819
- Clothes and all?
- Clothes and all.

186
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:54,197
Pump him full of black coffee
till it runs out his ears.

187
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:57,867
Kirby, when you come back,
come back sober. You've got two hours.

188
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:01,996
- Parades, Nashville...
- You can leave that keg.

189
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:06,376
You're welcome to it... sir.

190
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,795
Tangle with me and I'll have your hide.

191
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,967
You're welcome to that too, sir.
If it's in the line of duty.

192
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,690
( bugle)

193
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,866
- Forward, left!
- (others) Forward, left!

194
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:42,746
- Yo-oh!
- (others) Yo-oh!

195
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:51,172
(male choir) I left my love
My love I left, a-sleeping in her bed

196
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:56,302
I turned my back on my true love
Went fighting Johnny Reb

197
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:05,186
I left my love a letter
in the holler of a tree...

198
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:09,398
- Good luck, John.
- Thank you, sir.

199
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:15,946
Hi-ho, down they go
There's no such word as "can't"

200
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:23,078
We'll ride clean down to hell and back
for Ulysses Simpson Grant

201
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:29,919
I left my love a letter
in the holler of a tree

202
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:35,091
I told her she would find me
in the US Cavalry

203
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:38,427
In the US Cavalry

204
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:43,557
Hi-ho, down they go
There's no such word as "can't"

205
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:47,896
We'll ride clean down to New Orleans

206
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:54,277
For Ulysses Simpson Grant

207
00:15:57,614 --> 00:16:01,409
I left my love
My love I left

208
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,749
A-sleeping in her bed

209
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:20,846
Wait on here a minute.

210
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:25,308
- The sun, it raises in the east every time?
- It sure does in Missouri.

211
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:29,104
For eight hours, with no turning,
we've been heading this way.

212
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:32,399
If the sun raises in the east,
what direction is that?

213
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,403
- It ain't north.
- Course not. It's south.

214
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,449
We've been riding smack-dab
into reb territory.

215
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:46,455
- Reb country, Richard.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,171
Send out your scouts.

217
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:58,926
(yells order)

218
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:11,689
(yells order)

219
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,326
(gunfire)

220
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:04,992
Are you going to call a halt, or leave them
to the clemency of the enemy?

221
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:11,708
Sound recall.

222
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:13,877
( bugle)

223
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:40,195
Just a patrol, sir. No sign of any
major force, as far as I could tell.

224
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,739
The fact remains we've been spotted.

225
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:49,121
The word's out for sure now. They'll be
back here with everything available.

226
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:52,040
All right, Ned,
you can prepare to turn back.

227
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,461
That's a bad mistake, John,
splitting the force.

228
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:59,173
Now you need every man you've got.
Diversion be damned.

229
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:03,010
- They've got to think we all turned back.
- Oh, sure, sure.

230
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:07,514
But from now on, every Johnny Reb
with a gun will be hiding behind a tree

231
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,683
trying to make a name for himself.

232
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:13,520
And you want to cut your force
by one third! John, listen to me.

233
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:18,401
There's an old axiom in politics:
You never split your ballot...

234
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:22,906
Richard, when the horses are watered
and the men are fed, we'll move out.

235
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:34,375
Hey, Doctor.

236
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:39,380
These here contraband children say
there's something wrong at that cabin.

237
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:41,216
I guess they need a doctor.

238
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,349
All right.

239
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:58,733
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes, I am.

240
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:11,538
What happened?

241
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:15,333
It's Rainey, sir. Rainey the first. He's dead.

242
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:19,420
Carry on.

243
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,174
Where's Kendall?

244
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:28,054
Dr Kendall went over to that cabin
with some young coloured people.

245
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,724
- An emergency, I believe.
- He what?!

246
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,896
He went over to that cabin
with some young coloured people.

247
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:42,778
- Are you the doctor too?
- What? No, no.

248
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,704
(baby cries)

249
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,882
Kendall, what the devil are you doing?

250
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,593
We just delivered a baby.

251
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:07,762
It's a little girl.

252
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,099
You can take care of her now, Granny.

253
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:14,685
You're going to be all right.

254
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:24,612
We've got a couple of wounded men
out there, you know.

255
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:27,072
No, one's dead.

256
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:31,285
One's gone, one's born.

257
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,205
It's an amazing process, isn't it?

258
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,667
As many as I've delivered,
it never fails to awe me.

259
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:43,215
All right, children, you got a new sister.
Go in, take a look at her.

260
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,640
All right, Kendall.
Go back and take care of your wounded.

261
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:54,810
They'll be all right.
Hopkins knows what to do.

262
00:21:54,935 --> 00:22:01,525
You're not a country sawbones. You're
an officer in the Union Army under oath.

263
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,361
I took an older oath before that one.

264
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:09,449
They didn't seem to be having any trouble
having babies around here before.

265
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:14,412
I was asked to help and I couldn't turn 'em
down. Come off it. Even you were born.

266
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:18,375
As of now, you are under officer's arrest.

267
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,836
Insubordination.

268
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:26,258
- Do I still carry out my duties, sir?
- From now on confine them to the troops.

269
00:22:26,383 --> 00:22:29,094
Very well, sir.

270
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,097
Don't push me too far, Kendall.

271
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:11,471
Forward!

272
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:51,052
(dogs bark)

273
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:58,935
Lukey, what are the dogs
raising such a fuss about?

274
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,648
Dogs? You know how dogs
make such a fuss.

275
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:20,040
- Soldiers, Miss Hannah. Lots of 'em.
- Soldiers? How wonderful!

276
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:40,436
Thunder in the outhouse.
Them's Yankees.

277
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:43,355
Lukey, you go on downstairs
and meet them.

278
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,524
Lukey, do you hear?

279
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:11,425
Come here, girl.

280
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,595
Come on.

281
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:19,392
- Who lives here?
- Miss Hannah Hunter lives here.

282
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:23,480
Tell her I want to see her.
Colonel Marlowe, Union Army.

283
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,107
Yes, sir.

284
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,985
Put that gun away.

285
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,679
- Sorry for this intrusion, ma'am.
- It isn't that, Colonel.

286
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:03,728
It's just that I never prepared myself to see
that uniform within the walls of this house.

287
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,065
Ma'am, we no more wish to be here
than you do to have us.

288
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,276
Why, that's gallantly spoken, Colonel.

289
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:15,740
No matter what our differences,
I fear I'm forgetting the amenities.

290
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,535
- Welcome to Greenbriar, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

291
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,205
Lukey, take the gentlemen's hats.

292
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:32,849
- Sergeant Kirby.
- Sergeant.

293
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,935
Ma'am.

294
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,397
Well, shall we make ourselves
more comfortable in the Rose Room?

295
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:42,525
No, thank you, ma'am.
We'll only stay a moment.

296
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:45,195
You and your men are riding on?

297
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,074
No, we will bivouac
in your woods for the night.

298
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,868
Sleeping on the cold, cold ground?

299
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:57,082
When is this awful, wasteful,
terrible struggle going to end, Colonel?

300
00:26:57,207 --> 00:26:58,833
Brother against brother...

301
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:04,297
And during our stay no one will
be allowed to leave the premises.

302
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,758
Wherever would we go, Colonel?

303
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:11,513
I'm sure you must agree that this war
makes loneliness for everyone.

304
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:16,351
Also, I must commandeer most
of the grain and horses, if you have any.

305
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:21,314
You will be paid, Miss Hunter,
for everything, in Union greenbacks.

306
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,359
We will not bother you
any longer. Good evening.

307
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:27,737
- Kirby.
- By your leave, ma'am.

308
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:32,993
Hannah Hunter, what's got hold of you,
talking like a field hand? You alls, we alls.

309
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,079
Yankees!

310
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:43,129
It's uncanny, Colonel.

311
00:27:43,254 --> 00:27:46,632
I've heard about 'em, but I didn't believe it.

312
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:51,012
I received my commission
from the Governor of Michigan!

313
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,806
- Young man...
- What's your question?

314
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:57,935
The question is this man's authority
in his present position.

315
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,814
As usual, I am trying to present
the grim facts of life.

316
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:04,775
He doesn't understand
that coffee tastes better

317
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:08,946
if the latrines are dug
downstream instead of upstream.

318
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,574
How do you like your coffee, Colonel?

319
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:14,035
- Secord, you oughta...
- Pardon.

320
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,163
Colonel! Colonel Marlowe!

321
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,587
I am forgetting my manners.
Why, how I ever...

322
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,634
Well, I don't believe
I've met these gentlemen.

323
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,348
Miss Hunter. Colonel Secord.
Major Gray. Major Kendall.

324
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:37,016
Ma'am.

325
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,269
I'm just so scatterbrained.

326
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:44,190
Poor Papa and Mama must be
turning over in their graves at me

327
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:49,029
for not extending what little hospitality
Greenbriar can offer.

328
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:52,491
At least I can extend
an invitation to you for dinner.

329
00:28:52,616 --> 00:28:55,535
- No, Miss Hunter...
- I insist.

330
00:28:55,661 --> 00:28:58,747
There's three fat capons
that have to go anyhow.

331
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:03,877
What with our store of grain
being reduced, like you mentioned.

332
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:07,464
So, you see, you brought it
on yourself, didn't you?

333
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:10,759
Speaking for myself,
I would be delighted...

334
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:14,805
Very well, thank you.
Hot food is pretty hard to turn down.

335
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,683
Splendid. Now, how many can I count on?

336
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:20,394
- Would five or six be...?
- Not at all.

337
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:22,563
Perfectly wonderful.

338
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:24,481
At nine, gentlemen?

339
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:27,359
- Colonel Secord?
- Of the First Michigan, ma'am.

340
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:29,611
- Major Gray?
- Ma'am.

341
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:32,030
Major... Kendall, isn't it?

342
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:37,327
I'm afraid I'll have to regret, ma'am.
It's not of my choice, I assure you.

343
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:39,913
At the moment, I'm under arrest.

344
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,875
We will all be glad to accept
the invitation, Miss Hunter.

345
00:29:59,684 --> 00:30:01,853
Ma'am?

346
00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:04,731
You dropped your handkerchief.

347
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:10,361
- Care for a little more, Colonel Secord?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

348
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:12,614
Colonel Marlowe?

349
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:15,450
- No, thank you.
- Come now, Colonel.

350
00:30:15,575 --> 00:30:21,789
A man with a big frame like yours can't
just nibble away like a little old titmouse.

351
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:25,835
Gentlemen, please be seated.

352
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,716
Now, what was your preference?
The leg... or the breast?

353
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:39,349
I've had quite enough of both, thank you.

354
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,517
What a shame.

355
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,982
- Would anyone else like some more?
- (all) No, thank you.

356
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:53,988
Gentlemen, be seated.
I must warn you too, there's no coffee.

357
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:58,159
And a sweet or a dessert of any kind
was just out of the question.

358
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:00,620
Sugar's $150 a barrel.

359
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:05,667
"And yet your fair discourse
hath been as sweet as sugar,

360
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:09,505
making the hard way
sweet and delectable."

361
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,426
How perfectly charming.
A little something of your own?

362
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:17,096
No, ma'am. Richard II.

363
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:21,809
- By profession, I'm an actor.
- Why, how fascinating!

364
00:31:21,934 --> 00:31:27,147
Why, Major Kendall, your cigar.
Gentlemen, please be seated.

365
00:31:27,273 --> 00:31:29,608
(sighs)

366
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:35,614
Major Kendall a doctor. And
Colonel Secord almost a congressman.

367
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:40,119
And you an actor.
And now all military men.

368
00:31:40,244 --> 00:31:42,496
Such a waste of talent.

369
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:47,835
But, of course, Colonel Marlowe, I imagine
that you are a professional soldier.

370
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,964
No, prior to this insanity,
I was a railroad engineer.

371
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,466
Why, how thrilling.

372
00:31:54,592 --> 00:32:00,139
To think of being able to steer one of
those huge things, puffing and steaming.

373
00:32:00,264 --> 00:32:03,642
Ringing that little bell.
Ding-dong! Ding-dong!

374
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:08,188
Not quite. My job was
in the construction of railroads.

375
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:12,610
Why, my! Such brilliant minds.

376
00:32:12,735 --> 00:32:18,240
Poor little me barely squeezed through
Miss Longstreet's Seminary for Ladies.

377
00:32:18,365 --> 00:32:21,995
How did you ever manage
to remember all those books in college?

378
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,084
I didn't. I started driving
rail spikes at ten cents a day and found.

379
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:30,837
And now, Miss Hunter,
I must ask you to leave us.

380
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:35,634
We are taking the privilege of using
this room for an hour or two. If we may.

381
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,555
Of course, but wouldn't you prefer
using another room? The study, perhaps?

382
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,559
- We're quite comfortable here.
- (murmurs of agreement)

383
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:47,771
I'm sorry but I must be rude and explain.

384
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:52,108
Lukey and I must be in the fields
by five in the morning.

385
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:55,612
Gentlemen, go ahead
and light your cigars.

386
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:57,989
- Allow me.
- Thank you kindly.

387
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:01,660
All this and the dishes must be done
before she can get to bed.

388
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:05,580
- Am I being too inconsiderate?
- Of course not, ma'am.

389
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:08,959
- May I?
- Of course. This way, gentlemen.

390
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,753
How wonderful.

391
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:16,549
Really, I thought it was a charming dinner.

392
00:33:20,637 --> 00:33:23,473
- Post this room.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:33:23,598 --> 00:33:28,645
- I hope you'll be comfortable here.
- Oh, yes. This is fine.

394
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:34,277
- If you wish to light a fire, it's ready.
- No, it's fine.

395
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:38,864
- Some brandy. I'll have Lukey bring it.
- No, thank you, no brandy.

396
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,742
Are you sure there's
nothing more that I can...

397
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:43,369
Oh, yes.

398
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:46,205
Doctor, there's no need
for you to be a part of this.

399
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,460
Perhaps Miss Hunter would show you
some of the beauties of Greenbriar.

400
00:33:51,586 --> 00:33:56,173
- Why, of course, if he has any interest...
- He'd be pleased to.

401
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:59,176
Very well. Come, then, Doctor.

402
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:04,807
I noticed a lovely garden.
Shall we take a stroll?

403
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:07,310
Why, of course.

404
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:11,188
You know, you gentlemen must be
comfortable in your heavy uniforms,

405
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:16,068
but I feel a definite chill in the air -
it's me and my thin blood.

406
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:19,030
Would you excuse me
while I go and fetch a shawl?

407
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:21,490
- Miss Hunter.
- Yes, Major?

408
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,453
I'm afraid I'll have to go with you.

409
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:28,039
Upstairs? With me?

410
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:30,625
- Why, Major!
- You're only getting a shawl.

411
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,961
Of course,
but in these parts it's unheard of...

412
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,631
It's something
to tell your grandchildren.

413
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:40,635
This is war. At the moment,
Greenbriar is a military installation.

414
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,557
I don't suppose there's any real harm,
being that you're a doctor.

415
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:47,726
That's right.

416
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:57,527
Lukey, bring some brandy
to my sitting room, please.

417
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:06,536
- I hope you'll be comfortable here, Major.
- Thank you.

418
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:25,597
Thank you.

419
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:36,233
Hey! Where are you going with that?

420
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:40,237
- Miss Hannah asked for this brandy.
- I know, for the Major.

421
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:45,033
We never give any of our top-ranking
officers an unlabelled bottle,

422
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:48,036
unless somebody tastes it first.

423
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:50,998
- Is this what you does? Test things?
- Certainly.

424
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:55,837
See that second stripe? That means
I'm official taster for majors on up.

425
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:00,758
Here's La Grange.

426
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:06,180
We've come down here
approximately 80 miles.

427
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:11,894
- We're headed for Newton Station.
- Any word on the enemy strength there?

428
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,524
No, not a word. Whatever it is,
we're obliged to take it on.

429
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:20,778
- Good. Maybe we'll see action.
- This is not play-acting.

430
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,285
- Here's your brandy, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

431
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,122
- It's all tested.
- Tested?

432
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:35,877
By the man downstairs with
those tester's stripes, for majors on up.

433
00:36:36,002 --> 00:36:38,880
Oh, yes. Sergeant Kirby.

434
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:43,426
- He really tested it, didn't he?
- Yes, sir. Twice.

435
00:36:43,551 --> 00:36:45,887
- Lukey?
- Yes, Miss Hannah.

436
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:50,642
Excuse me, sir.

437
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:02,820
(Marlowe)... very lucky.

438
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:13,582
(officers' voices)

439
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:19,505
That is the next piece of information.
We're not going back to La Grange.

440
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,467
- We're what?
- We're not going back north.

441
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:30,766
We're heading south to Baton Rouge
to join up with the Union forces there.

442
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:35,854
- Great Scott, when did you decide that?
- It's the best way. It's the only way.

443
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:41,902
John, it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to Baton Rouge.

444
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:46,156
And it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to La Grange.

445
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:51,662
Only the rebs will really have been closed
in behind us, ready to chew us to bits.

446
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:54,999
So we'll go out the way
they least expect: Straight south.

447
00:37:55,124 --> 00:38:00,546
Damn it, it's suicide. Is it possible your
orders could have been misinterpreted?

448
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:02,715
My only duty after Newton Station

449
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,594
is to get as many of these men
back alive as I can.

450
00:38:10,014 --> 00:38:12,600
(Secord) And so I still must protest.

451
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:15,895
What's more, I want that
on the record for General Hurlburt.

452
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:18,356
It is impetuous mass suicide.

453
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:21,151
(Marlowe) It's on the record, but get this.

454
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:25,447
Unless enemy action allows you to
take my place, that's the way it will be.

455
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:29,200
Blow Newton Station off the map,
then through to Baton Rouge.

456
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:32,203
There will be no change.
Do you understand?

457
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:34,456
(Secord) All right, you're in command.

458
00:38:34,581 --> 00:38:38,919
(Marlowe) Now let's go over it again.
Straight through to Baton Rouge.

459
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:41,129
We will not turn back.

460
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:47,177
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Was the brandy satisfactory?

461
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:52,140
- Excellent. Won't you join me?
- Goodness me, no. I never touch spirits.

462
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:56,394
My papa taught me that a girl ought
to keep her wits about her at all times.

463
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:58,897
Your father raised a very smart girl.

464
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:02,025
You're being sweet.
Would you like to see the garden?

465
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,694
Didn't you forget your shawl?

466
00:39:05,654 --> 00:39:07,697
Why, Lukey!

467
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:19,793
Now, Lukey, you take that tray downstairs
and go about doing what you have to do.

468
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:25,423
You know, I remember the first time I tried
spirits, at the Governor's Ball in Jackson.

469
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:30,930
My escort, Adam Lovelace from Biloxi,
well, he gave me a mint julep.

470
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:34,934
You know, those Lovelace boys
are all very handsome, but fast,

471
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:37,061
if you know what I mean.

472
00:39:37,186 --> 00:39:42,358
If I could tell you the thoughts that went
on in my mind after that one julep... My!

473
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:46,028
I'd rather know the thoughts
going on in your mind right now.

474
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:51,993
- Kendall, what in the name of...?
- Sorry we have to interrupt.

475
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:54,495
Ask them what they
think your chances are

476
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,707
of blowing up Newton Station
and getting to Baton Rouge.

477
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:01,669
- Are you drunk?
- Unfortunately, no.

478
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:03,671
They were listening upstairs.

479
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:12,430
Makes a pretty good stethoscope.

480
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:15,057
Don't feel guilty.
I was slow to catch on too.

481
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:17,059
Where were you, Kendall?

482
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:21,105
Well, a gentlemen thinks twice
before peeking into a lady's bedroom,

483
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,357
but sometimes it pays off.

484
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:26,444
Looks like she's made
a fool out of both of us.

485
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:29,155
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

486
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:33,743
You know something, Miss Hunter?

487
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:36,245
You have put me
to quite an inconvenience.

488
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,916
At least I've accomplished something, sir.

489
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:44,004
I don't suppose I could accept your word
of honour not to discuss this with anyone.

490
00:40:44,129 --> 00:40:47,215
- I don't hold to honour with any Yankees.
- Exactly.

491
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:50,302
So the whole state of Mississippi
will be alerted.

492
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:53,430
So could you possibly suggest
what I should do with you?

493
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:57,434
I noticed she was getting on your nerves.
Now's your chance to shoot her.

494
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:01,563
- One more word out of you...
- Go ahead. Shoot us.

495
00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:03,523
Shoot both of us.

496
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:09,363
But you'll never get away with your filthy,
murdering plans, Mr Colonel Marlowe.

497
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:13,533
You Yankees and your holy principle
about saving the Union.

498
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:16,995
You're plundering pirates, that's what.

499
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,415
You think there's no Confederate army
where you're going?

500
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,753
Do you think our boys
are asleep down here?

501
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:29,091
They'll catch up to you
and they'll cut you to pieces,

502
00:41:29,216 --> 00:41:31,969
you nameless, fatherless scum!

503
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,890
And I wish I could be there to see it.

504
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:40,602
If it happens, Miss Hunter, you will be.

505
00:41:56,536 --> 00:41:58,580
Hurry it up.

506
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,823
All right.

507
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:20,663
You're an excellent rider, Miss Hunter.

508
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:24,541
Interesting country, isn't it?

509
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:30,339
I'm more interested in why you vandals
confiscated my dead father's clothes.

510
00:43:30,464 --> 00:43:33,676
Well, they're for our cadets.

511
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,928
- Scouts.
- Scouts!

512
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:38,138
Spies, you mean.

513
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:42,601
It's a wonder they don't crawl along
on their bellies like snakes.

514
00:43:42,726 --> 00:43:46,188
You'll find out what happens
to spies down here.

515
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:50,234
My personal experience with spies
is limited. I've only known one.

516
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:54,029
Do you mind, Major?
I prefer to ride alone.

517
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:57,157
Ma'am.

518
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:04,456
Miss Hannah!

519
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:19,472
All right, forward! Yo-oh!

520
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:25,061
Back in line, Doctor.

521
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:31,943
(Hannah screams)

522
00:44:56,775 --> 00:45:01,112
- These lady's drawers are almost dry.
- Yeah.

523
00:45:03,073 --> 00:45:05,158
Aren't you getting chilly?

524
00:45:05,283 --> 00:45:07,911
Don't tell me you're concerned
about my health.

525
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:13,041
If I give you back your clothes,
will you promise not to run away again?

526
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:17,754
I would, ma'am. There's a point
where pride becomes impractical.

527
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:22,051
Actually, if you could get a look
at yourself, I'd think you'd agree.

528
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:25,513
Very well. I do wish to keep my health.

529
00:45:26,681 --> 00:45:30,059
- I shall not try to run away again.
- Your word of honour?

530
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:35,147
- My word of honour.
- To Yankees?

531
00:45:35,273 --> 00:45:38,693
- To Yankees.
- Cross your heart?

532
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:40,903
- I gave you my word!
- All right, Lukey.

533
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:44,073
Help Miss Hunter with her clothes.

534
00:45:44,198 --> 00:45:48,077
I'm glad you're being sensible.
You were beginning to worry me.

535
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:51,914
- From a medical standpoint.
- Thank you, Doctor.

536
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:58,921
I wish I could be of further assistance, but
you Southern people have your own help.

537
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:21,444
(Kirby) Attention! Eyes front!

538
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,583
Rebs, sir!

539
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,462
Hopping that riverbank.
A full brigade, coming fast.

540
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:42,132
Horse, foot and artillery, sir.
It ain't militia, neither.

541
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,218
- How far?
- Ten minutes.

542
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:48,347
All right, get out of sight,
get in those trees.

543
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:56,396
Enemy patrol. Take cover and choke up.

544
00:46:56,522 --> 00:47:01,068
- Bugler!
- Not bugler, you idiot! Hand signals.

545
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:07,324
Enemy across the river.
Move out. Keep it quiet.

546
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:12,412
Why doesn't he stand and fight?
He's got a full brigade.

547
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,630
(rebel troops sing
"The Bonnie Blue Flag")

548
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,764
(singing continues)

549
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:38,730
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Southern rights, hurrah!

550
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:43,444
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

551
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,490
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Southern rights, hurrah!

552
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:52,161
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star

553
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,753
- (horse snorts)
- Take it easy.

554
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,298
Come on, stop it.

555
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,220
(singing continues)

556
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,382
Hannah!

557
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:52,680
Hey! Help! Over here!

558
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:57,144
- (muffled scream)
- Ouch!

559
00:48:57,269 --> 00:49:00,397
Let go with those teeth!

560
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:04,318
- I've got 800 men out there.
- Get some water.

561
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:22,044
Looks to be all clear across the river.

562
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:23,838
Well...

563
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:54,159
How many men does it take
to keep one lone female quiet?

564
00:50:04,795 --> 00:50:09,009
Colonel, the prisoner
would like a word with you.

565
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,763
Yes, Miss Hunter?

566
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:16,975
I'm not here to complain
about what you did.

567
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,812
It was your duty as you saw it,
and you did it.

568
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:22,939
I'm sorry you had to break your word.

569
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:27,027
I gave my word not to run away. I didn't
give it not to cry out for assistance.

570
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,571
I suppose there's a fine point there,

571
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:32,574
but I have to ask you to give me
your word on that too.

572
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:35,827
I do that, here and now.

573
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:41,416
Or I suppose when I testify against you,
I'd be handicapped with a broken jaw.

574
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:44,002
I'd say so. Anything else, ma'am?

575
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:48,798
One slight item.
My constant companions there.

576
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:51,635
I don't know how it is up North, of course,

577
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,098
but down South there are times when
Southern women feel the need for privacy.

578
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:00,185
You two.

579
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:05,148
We was respectful. Real respectful, sir.

580
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:10,779
You told us it was all right just as long
as we could see the top of her head.

581
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:13,365
- You told them that?
- Well...

582
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,825
Then there's one more item.

583
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:28,673
I suggest you see a doctor.
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

584
00:51:38,683 --> 00:51:40,476
(gunshot)

585
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:46,023
Over there in that barn. Come on.

586
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:48,192
(gunshots)

587
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:16,721
- We was bushwhacked, Colonel.
- All right, smoke 'em out.

588
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:24,729
Hold your fire.

589
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:34,323
Hey, there! We're Confederates,
but we ain't hostile.

590
00:52:34,448 --> 00:52:38,410
- Honest!
- Drop your weapons and come on out.

591
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,162
Yes, sir.

592
00:52:40,954 --> 00:52:43,290
Coming.

593
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:55,010
Hey, Virgil, come ahead on.

594
00:52:56,303 --> 00:52:58,347
They's real bluebellies.

595
00:52:58,472 --> 00:53:00,516
Watch it, Colonel.

596
00:53:02,476 --> 00:53:06,188
Just the two of us, Cap. And one captive.

597
00:53:16,281 --> 00:53:20,619
Howdy, Cap. Jackie Jo and me is sorry
about popping away at you people.

598
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:23,622
We thought you was
more sheriff's deputies.

599
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:26,625
What have you got
against sheriff's deputies?

600
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:30,170
- That's a good one, huh?
- That's a slick one.

601
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:33,173
We just love sheriff's deputies.

602
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:38,429
They're deserters from the Confederacy,
sir. The lowest swine bred.

603
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:43,101
- I take it you're the sheriff?
- Captain Henry Goodbody, retired.

604
00:53:43,226 --> 00:53:45,395
Acting sheriff of Lorena County.

605
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,730
I was about to apprehend these rats...

606
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:52,235
But we bushwhacked you,
you old goat, didn't we?

607
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:58,074
(Virgil) That we did, Jackie Jo.
But tell them about us, Captain Goodyo.

608
00:54:01,286 --> 00:54:04,455
- Don't you dare touch him again!
- Miss Hunter.

609
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:09,961
You! You call yourself a man?
Treating with that scum?

610
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:12,213
Miss Hunter, that man is our enemy.

611
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:16,134
One word from you of any kind
and he will be shot. Understand?

612
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:18,511
That's right, Cap.

613
00:54:26,102 --> 00:54:30,481
- Can I help you, miss?
- I'm quite capable of getting on by myself.

614
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:37,780
Seems you need a little attention. Doctor!
Will you look to our good friend's ear?

615
00:54:37,906 --> 00:54:43,536
Sorry but I got a weak stomach. Otis,
see what you can do for our new recruit.

616
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:50,836
Hard to explain a man, isn't it?

617
00:54:54,965 --> 00:54:57,259
Take care of this man.

618
00:54:57,384 --> 00:54:59,637
Gunshot wound, sir.

619
00:55:02,389 --> 00:55:06,060
Ow! You aim to stick that thing
clear through to the other side?

620
00:55:06,185 --> 00:55:10,314
I seriously doubt it would have met
with any obstruction.

621
00:55:10,439 --> 00:55:13,359
Sergeant, give me a couple
of those good cigars.

622
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,819
Ow! Hey!

623
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:19,949
- Did it hurt you, Virgil?
- This will make you feel better.

624
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:24,036
We'll have a talk, fellas.
Did you come through Newton Station?

625
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:27,331
- Sure did.
- Any troops there?

626
00:55:27,456 --> 00:55:30,834
Not no more.
Now, the Alabama Sixth, it was there.

627
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,796
But it moved to Vicksburg
with the Georgia Tenth.

628
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:38,092
- The Tenth was Virg and my's old outfit.
- "Was" is right.

629
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:41,554
I guess there aren't any troops
within 30 or 40 miles.

630
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,348
- 60 at least.
- (sheriff) You vile traitors!

631
00:55:44,473 --> 00:55:47,726
Vicksburg, you say?
That's where we're headed for.

632
00:55:47,852 --> 00:55:50,187
Looks like we're in for a little fight.

633
00:55:50,312 --> 00:55:55,067
- Thanks, fellas. Untie the sheriff.
- High on the hog, huh, Virg?

634
00:55:56,694 --> 00:56:00,991
Hey, looks like you Yankee boys
do all right with the women.

635
00:56:01,116 --> 00:56:04,995
(Jackie Jo) And that's a pretty
towheaded one you've got there.

636
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,038
- Hi.
- Howdy, missy.

637
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:10,876
- Hi, missy.
- See what I told you about up North?

638
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:15,714
- Sergeant, your gauntlets.
- A pleasure, sir.

639
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:21,011
(Virgil) Hi, missy. Hey, missy.

640
00:56:21,136 --> 00:56:23,388
Remove the prisoner.

641
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:27,934
Are you going to shoot him personal,
Cap? Let Jackie Jo here do it.

642
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:30,520
He's the best dang shot I ever seen.

643
00:56:30,645 --> 00:56:33,648
I once saw him shoot
a runaway negro slave woman...

644
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:36,026
right through the... eyes.

645
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:39,863
(punch)

646
00:56:41,156 --> 00:56:43,533
Tie 'em up.

647
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:57,964
Sheriff, I'll leave them in your hands.
Pistol. It's loaded.

648
00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:03,678
With the compliments
of Miss Hannah Hunter of Greenbriar.

649
00:57:05,138 --> 00:57:07,766
- Thank you, sir.
- You are welcome, sir.

650
00:57:09,518 --> 00:57:11,395
Satisfied, Miss Hunter?

651
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:15,942
Well, your sense of justice
does surprise me a little.

652
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:20,821
Justice? Those men would
have been excess baggage.

653
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:24,200
I don't trust them any more
than I really trust...

654
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:26,869
- Than me?
- That's right.

655
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:35,962
Yes, ma'am. A hard man to understand.

656
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:47,430
NEWTON STATION
THE RAILROAD JUNCTION

657
00:57:47,556 --> 00:57:51,351
SUPPLYING THE CONFEDERATE
FORCES AT VICKSBURG

658
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:12,806
- Hi there, girls!
- Yankees! Get out of here!

659
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:21,523
Get out, you dirty Yankees!
Get out of here!

660
00:58:56,935 --> 00:58:58,520
- Jonathan!
- Miss Hunter.

661
00:58:58,645 --> 00:59:02,607
Mustn't talk to the prisoners.
We've got a nice room for you upstairs.

662
00:59:02,732 --> 00:59:06,486
- A nice hot bath for you.
- You can change your clothes.

663
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:08,696
You see, we've got a lot of work to do.

664
00:59:08,822 --> 00:59:12,283
- You're not going to burn the town?
- No. Just war supplies.

665
00:59:12,408 --> 00:59:17,163
Cotton. Railway equipment.
Contraband, ma'am.

666
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:20,500
Contraband. That's me, ain't it?

667
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:29,092
Come on! Dismount!

668
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:36,058
- Neatly done, Richard.
- Thank you, sir.

669
00:59:36,183 --> 00:59:38,769
- Is this the whole garrison?
- Every last man.

670
00:59:38,894 --> 00:59:42,565
They gave up without a struggle,
like Caesar to Cleopatra.

671
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,234
Without a struggle, huh?

672
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,780
Kirby, set up headquarters
in this hotel.

673
00:59:49,905 --> 00:59:52,658
- It would be a pleasure, sir.
- And close the bar.

674
00:59:52,783 --> 00:59:56,704
- Yes, sir.
- Shall we set about the day's work?

675
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:02,334
I'm going to love setting a torch
to this nest of rebels.

676
01:00:10,009 --> 01:00:12,052
Prisoner!

677
01:00:12,178 --> 01:00:16,682
- Rebel colonel, sir.
- Yes, sir?

678
01:00:16,807 --> 01:00:21,520
What is the contraband in the warehouses
and on those cars in the sidings?

679
01:00:21,645 --> 01:00:26,358
The property of the Confederate States
of America is not contraband, sir.

680
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:28,110
Oh?

681
01:00:28,235 --> 01:00:30,905
Well, let's look at it
from my side, Colonel.

682
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:35,284
- Jonathan! Jonny Miles.
- You know the Colonel?

683
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:41,665
Sure. We're old friends. Last time
we served together was fighting Indians.

684
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,293
Sorry about the arm.
When did that happen?

685
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:49,216
I want neither your solicitude
nor to recall our association.

686
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:52,636
Have I your permission to retire, sir?

687
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,931
Take him away.

688
01:01:06,024 --> 01:01:09,027
I can't figure a man like Miles
giving up that easy.

689
01:01:09,152 --> 01:01:11,696
He's West Point. Tough as nails.

690
01:01:11,822 --> 01:01:14,866
Maybe losing that arm
took a lot out of him.

691
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:20,497
The man I knew could lose both arms
and still try to kick you to death. Hoppy?

692
01:01:21,706 --> 01:01:26,044
- Did you picket this whole area?
- Yes, sir.

693
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,883
Colonel! There's a reb train coming in, sir.

694
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:34,219
Secord! Woodward!

695
01:01:40,642 --> 01:01:42,227
This bar's closed.

696
01:01:42,352 --> 01:01:44,896
(whistle of approaching train)

697
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:51,528
Well, it must be a supply train -
rolling right into our laps.

698
01:01:51,653 --> 01:01:54,739
I never saw a supply train
without guards on it before.

699
01:01:54,865 --> 01:01:57,827
They wouldn't be too alert
in their own territory.

700
01:01:57,952 --> 01:02:01,205
- Where was that reb colonel?
- The telegraph office.

701
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,333
- Telegraph office?
- Yes, sir.

702
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:08,796
All right, Secord, you know what to do.

703
01:02:08,921 --> 01:02:11,716
Get those horses under cover!

704
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:30,485
Get them wagons!

705
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:56,552
Get that bale off there. Watch it!

706
01:03:19,409 --> 01:03:21,245
Down, out of sight.

707
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,413
Cover from inside.

708
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,833
(train whistle)

709
01:03:31,547 --> 01:03:33,799
- Sir?
- No, I don't need it.

710
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:40,430
- Everyone's ready for action, sir.
- Thank you.

711
01:04:30,982 --> 01:04:33,651
(gunfire)

712
01:04:56,382 --> 01:04:57,801
Fire!

713
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:09,729
I didn't want this. I tried to avoid a fight.

714
01:05:09,854 --> 01:05:12,398
That's why I took up medicine.

715
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:05,077
- Look at that idiot!
- Jonny! Jonny Miles!

716
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:07,246
Cease fire!

717
01:06:07,371 --> 01:06:09,415
( bugle)

718
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:24,555
- (Kendall) All right, move him up.
- Move this man up.

719
01:06:26,265 --> 01:06:29,268
Let me be of assistance.
I'm a physician. Dr Marvin.

720
01:06:29,393 --> 01:06:33,481
Major Kendall. We appreciate your help.

721
01:06:33,606 --> 01:06:35,399
This man is next.

722
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,124
Go get some air.

723
01:06:51,249 --> 01:06:53,919
- I can help.
- Get out.

724
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,014
Get him out of here.

725
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,953
Lou, you go and get some ice.
All you can find.

726
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:30,664
You too. You help him. Quick.

727
01:08:46,824 --> 01:08:48,868
(explosions)

728
01:09:07,846 --> 01:09:10,682
How long are you going to be, Kendall?

729
01:09:10,808 --> 01:09:13,143
Take a look for yourself. We just started.

730
01:09:13,268 --> 01:09:17,189
- I need a definite answer.
- I can't give you one.

731
01:09:17,314 --> 01:09:20,067
I've got a job to do too, you know.

732
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,904
At least five hours.

733
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,450
Colonel. Hey, Colonel.

734
01:09:32,246 --> 01:09:34,832
Hello, trooper.

735
01:09:34,957 --> 01:09:38,085
I'm Hoskins. Bud Hoskins.

736
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,546
K Company, sir.

737
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:43,382
- You don't know me.
- Sure I know you.

738
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:47,094
Good soldier. You just lie easy, son.

739
01:09:48,345 --> 01:09:51,431
I put my hand on there and it's all...

740
01:09:52,474 --> 01:09:54,726
Just lie still.

741
01:09:56,478 --> 01:09:59,648
You'll write my ma, Colonel?
She'd love it if you...

742
01:09:59,773 --> 01:10:03,861
You'll be writing her yourself before long.

743
01:10:03,986 --> 01:10:05,612
No.

744
01:10:05,737 --> 01:10:07,865
No, I know.

745
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:13,163
- And I'm scared, Colonel.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

746
01:10:14,372 --> 01:10:16,583
No, I'm all right.

747
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:19,169
Just hold onto me, sir.

748
01:10:20,253 --> 01:10:22,297
And write my ma.

749
01:10:23,089 --> 01:10:25,341
I'll be in your debt forever.

750
01:10:41,608 --> 01:10:43,651
Aren't you proud?

751
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:48,156
Yes, I'm very proud of that boy.

752
01:10:55,914 --> 01:10:58,249
- Report.
- Three dead, 18 wounded.

753
01:10:58,374 --> 01:11:02,712
Demolition proceeding as ordered, sir.
And the bar is closed.

754
01:11:02,837 --> 01:11:04,881
The bar is open!

755
01:11:25,986 --> 01:11:30,491
- Get some laudanum.
- There is no more, sir.

756
01:11:42,586 --> 01:11:47,133
Come down out of there, buster,
unless you want to go up with it.

757
01:11:56,308 --> 01:11:58,352
(explosion)

758
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:07,027
Well, John, there goes half a million
dollars of railroad equipment.

759
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:11,115
That's how I made my living, you know.
Building railroads.

760
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,534
(explosion)

761
01:12:14,827 --> 01:12:20,499
The railroad's finished for eight miles!
North and south...

762
01:12:24,044 --> 01:12:28,174
John, what are you doing? Wait a minute!

763
01:12:29,758 --> 01:12:31,177
- John!
- Get out!

764
01:12:31,302 --> 01:12:33,929
- You figure this is a hospital?
- Listen to me.

765
01:12:34,054 --> 01:12:38,143
And I can do it to colonels, too!
Get out of here.

766
01:12:39,603 --> 01:12:41,646
(explosion)

767
01:12:43,356 --> 01:12:45,400
(explosion)

768
01:12:47,152 --> 01:12:49,196
(explosions)

769
01:12:54,826 --> 01:13:00,290
When we move out, give your people -
the wounded - a lot of liquor.

770
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:04,461
I'd do that anyway.

771
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,734
(explosions continue)

772
01:13:29,486 --> 01:13:31,530
Here, take this.

773
01:13:33,156 --> 01:13:35,200
It will steady you down.

774
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:45,752
I've never seen it this way before.

775
01:13:48,256 --> 01:13:51,008
I was with my father when he died.

776
01:13:52,176 --> 01:13:54,428
But he died peacefully.

777
01:13:55,555 --> 01:14:00,101
- Without pain.
- Well, it was lucky.

778
01:14:00,226 --> 01:14:03,312
- For both of you.
- (man screaming)

779
01:14:03,437 --> 01:14:06,691
Go ahead, Kendall! Have a field day!

780
01:14:06,816 --> 01:14:09,235
What do you mean, field day?

781
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,487
He's fighting to save men's lives.

782
01:14:11,612 --> 01:14:16,200
Men's lives?
Or the reputation of his profession?

783
01:14:16,325 --> 01:14:21,581
- You can't be serious, Colonel Marlowe.
- Have it your way, ma'am.

784
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:27,712
- Medicine is the most noble...
- Sure, noble profession, noble oath.

785
01:14:27,837 --> 01:14:33,926
Lanterns held on high. So high
they won't admit they're groping for...

786
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,103
- You're unfair and...
- Unfair?

787
01:14:46,063 --> 01:14:51,360
There was a girl not much older
than that boy in there.

788
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:54,697
I wasn't unfair then, understand?

789
01:14:54,822 --> 01:15:01,163
Because they used a lot of fancy words
that a section hand wouldn't understand.

790
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:05,417
So I held her down
while two of 'em worked on her.

791
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:09,338
I trusted doctors then. Believed in 'em.

792
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:13,884
Because I was in love
and I didn't want to see her die.

793
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:18,096
A tumour, they said it was.

794
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,058
And it had to come out right away.

795
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:25,437
So they stuck a leather strap in her mouth
so she could bite off her screams

796
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:28,232
while they cut away to get in there.

797
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,735
And what did they find? Nothing!

798
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,948
Oh, they were sorry.
Sure, they'd made a mistake.

799
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,701
They had something to talk about
before their next experiment.

800
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:44,039
But what about me?
They left me begging her not to die.

801
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:46,208
I lost my wife.

802
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,548
I didn't kill either one of them.

803
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:56,385
I must have been crazy,
or too conventional.

804
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:03,600
Quite a speech.
I guess I'm feeling my liquor.

805
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,526
(shouted orders)

806
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,791
Whoo!

807
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:39,929
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

808
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:50,064
Thanks, Hank.

809
01:16:53,193 --> 01:16:57,655
- Well, we almost fooled you.
- Almost.

810
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:02,452
You'll never make it, Hank.
They're already closing in on you.

811
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:05,663
Bedford Forest is sniffing at your heels.

812
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:09,501
You're headed straight
for that prison at Andersonville.

813
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:14,798
There's nothing we can do
to help you there. The South is starving.

814
01:17:14,923 --> 01:17:18,051
Jonathan, all I'm doing
is practising medicine.

815
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:20,971
Old ironhead does all the thinking.

816
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:24,099
He thinks things pretty good. West Point?

817
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:26,811
No, section hand.

818
01:17:29,188 --> 01:17:32,691
- How are Susan and the kids?
- They're fine.

819
01:17:32,817 --> 01:17:37,363
In Vicksburg.
I expect you'll be seeing them soon.

820
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:40,574
Nice try, Jonathan. Nice try.

821
01:17:44,829 --> 01:17:47,289
See you in Vicksburg, Hoppy.

822
01:17:54,338 --> 01:17:58,467
- Goodbye, Hoppy.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

823
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:01,679
I want to thank you for all I've learned.

824
01:18:01,804 --> 01:18:05,850
I shall endeavour
to get home alive as many as I can.

825
01:18:05,975 --> 01:18:08,018
You're a good man, Hoppy.

826
01:18:08,144 --> 01:18:13,816
After this thing is all over, if we don't meet
again, be sure and finish medical school.

827
01:18:14,984 --> 01:18:17,528
I shall make a point of it, sir.

828
01:18:23,534 --> 01:18:26,495
Goodbye, Doctor. And good luck.

829
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,790
Thank you, Doctor, for all your help.

830
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:50,437
Vicksburg. They're headed
southwest to Baton Rouge.

831
01:18:50,562 --> 01:18:53,231
Baton Rouge.

832
01:18:53,356 --> 01:18:57,360
It's Baton Rouge, Major.
Tell General Forest.

833
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:15,212
(Secord) Yes, you can. I'm on the board of
inquiry. I know exactly what can be done.

834
01:19:15,337 --> 01:19:18,298
Now, he has no right, even as a...

835
01:19:24,179 --> 01:19:26,515
- Phil...
- Yes, John?

836
01:19:27,182 --> 01:19:30,310
I'm sorry about what happened
back at Newton Station.

837
01:19:30,435 --> 01:19:34,064
Forget it, John.
You were under a strain.

838
01:19:34,189 --> 01:19:37,567
But since you brought up the subject...

839
01:19:37,692 --> 01:19:40,362
You know, John,
I'm an older man than you are.

840
01:19:40,487 --> 01:19:42,740
What's more, I'm a politician.

841
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:45,618
We've knocked over Newton Station.

842
01:19:45,743 --> 01:19:48,371
It's a glorious thing on my... our records.

843
01:19:48,496 --> 01:19:52,208
But now is the time to head north,
back to La Grange...

844
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:55,878
We're committed, Phil, and that's that.

845
01:19:56,003 --> 01:19:58,923
Stubborn. Stubborn!

846
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:04,303
Ouch.

847
01:20:04,428 --> 01:20:07,557
Can I have some of that liquor
to swallow, Doc?

848
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:11,102
You haven't got a good enough excuse.
How'd this happen, Dunker?

849
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:15,857
I was chopping down one of them
telegraph poles back there in Newton.

850
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:20,278
- The axe ricocheted right onto my leg.
- (laughter)

851
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:23,239
- Go arrest the axe.
- It ain't nothing.

852
01:20:23,364 --> 01:20:28,202
Nothing, huh? Almost blood poisoning.
You're lucky I saw you limping.

853
01:20:28,327 --> 01:20:30,037
Aw, Doc...

854
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:34,584
What are you putting on there? Dirt?

855
01:20:36,377 --> 01:20:43,551
Tree moss. Ordinary green mould. It has
some sort of healing agent, I imagine.

856
01:20:43,676 --> 01:20:48,514
- You imagine?
- I don't imagine the results, Colonel.

857
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,976
This is an old Cheyenne Indian cure.

858
01:20:52,101 --> 01:20:56,148
Tsk! Cheyenne Indian cure!

859
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:59,735
Green mould! Tree moss!

860
01:21:05,324 --> 01:21:08,827
You keep this on.
Report any soreness to me.

861
01:22:02,923 --> 01:22:04,968
Lukey!

862
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:27,615
- What for they shoot me, Miss Hannah?
- It's all right.

863
01:22:31,995 --> 01:22:34,038
(Kendall) Get my bag.

864
01:22:56,269 --> 01:23:00,273
- She's gone, ma'am.
- Oh, no.

865
01:23:00,398 --> 01:23:02,734
(sobs)

866
01:23:15,164 --> 01:23:18,250
Are you all right, Miss Hannah?

867
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:21,462
I brought you a little bitty piece of candle.

868
01:23:21,587 --> 01:23:25,299
We'll have some hot water
for you in the morning.

869
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:30,888
And lookee here. I found
a piece of looking glass for you.

870
01:23:40,356 --> 01:23:42,399
Thank you.

871
01:23:56,330 --> 01:24:01,502
I hope you'll... be able
to get some rest here.

872
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:11,220
You must know how we feel,
ma'am, about Lukey.

873
01:24:13,305 --> 01:24:16,433
How much we regret...

874
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:18,602
how sorry I am...

875
01:24:19,436 --> 01:24:22,982
that in some way we were the cause of...

876
01:24:23,107 --> 01:24:25,651
Lukey isn't asking for that.

877
01:24:25,777 --> 01:24:28,446
I wish I could let you go.

878
01:24:29,489 --> 01:24:31,533
If I gave you a horse and let you go,

879
01:24:31,658 --> 01:24:37,122
would you promise not to tell anybody
our plans for the next 24 hours?

880
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:40,167
It's too late.

881
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:42,794
It's too late for all of that.

882
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,466
No more promises.

883
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,387
No more anything now.

884
01:24:56,766 --> 01:25:01,563
I'm sorry. Truly sorry.

885
01:25:11,781 --> 01:25:13,867
Dunker.

886
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:19,122
Agh!

887
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:23,835
- That leg was all right yesterday.
- Yes, but this morning it got swolled.

888
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,339
- I had to tear my trouser leg.
- Where's the poultice?

889
01:25:27,464 --> 01:25:31,676
It started into itching, sir,
so I just yanked her off.

890
01:25:31,802 --> 01:25:35,180
It was a sign it was
beginning to heal, you fool.

891
01:25:37,558 --> 01:25:39,977
Come in here, or you're in trouble.

892
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:42,355
Brown, lend a hand.

893
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:46,526
Over there.

894
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:51,322
- Coffee?
- Thanks.

895
01:25:53,241 --> 01:25:55,284
Report.

896
01:25:56,619 --> 01:26:01,457
That's Salt Springs, all right, sir.
Nary a soldier inside, neither.

897
01:26:01,582 --> 01:26:06,212
Just some old women, a couple
of salt mills and a school for little boys.

898
01:26:06,337 --> 01:26:11,592
- The salt mills will need burning.
- Why show ourselves? We've been lucky.

899
01:26:11,717 --> 01:26:14,387
You call that coffee?

900
01:26:14,512 --> 01:26:17,807
We can't pass 'em up.
Salt is as valuable as ammunition.

901
01:26:17,932 --> 01:26:21,144
We'll bivouac here
and hit them in the morning.

902
01:26:21,269 --> 01:26:23,604
All right, you're the boss.

903
01:26:26,524 --> 01:26:32,738
(Dunker, drunk)  Hi-ho, down we go
There ain't no such word as "can't"...

904
01:26:32,864 --> 01:26:37,952
- What's going on?
- The doctor's working on Dunker's leg.

905
01:26:38,077 --> 01:26:40,121
(drunken singing)

906
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:48,297
I left my love
My love I left...

907
01:26:48,422 --> 01:26:50,466
Take another pull.

908
01:26:53,635 --> 01:26:57,639
Ah, that's good store liquor, Doc.
Who hit John?

909
01:26:57,764 --> 01:27:01,810
- I've got to take it off, Dunker.
- What did you say?

910
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:04,396
I've got to take your leg off.

911
01:27:05,731 --> 01:27:07,733
You've got to what?

912
01:27:07,858 --> 01:27:12,404
The poison's gone too far.
You'll be dead by morning.

913
01:27:15,157 --> 01:27:20,037
What can come of me after that, Doc?
One leg? What can come of me after that?

914
01:27:20,704 --> 01:27:24,458
I'll rig a sling and leave you
with the closest civilian care.

915
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:26,335
Civilian care?

916
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:30,172
Then comes prison next, huh?
Andersonville?

917
01:27:30,297 --> 01:27:32,883
Is that what happens to me, Doc?!

918
01:27:33,008 --> 01:27:36,261
- Quite possibly.
- Yeah.

919
01:27:36,386 --> 01:27:40,098
That's a hell of a tough choice
for a fella to have to make.

920
01:27:40,224 --> 01:27:45,354
- Ain't it? Well, tell me. Ain't it?
- It's got to come off.

921
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,818
All right.

922
01:27:50,943 --> 01:27:53,070
You just fire away.

923
01:27:53,195 --> 01:27:58,408
But before you start sawing,
you give me some of that chloroform stuff.

924
01:27:58,867 --> 01:28:03,289
- You put me out, Doc.
- I'll give you what I got.

925
01:28:14,092 --> 01:28:17,679
Now bite this.
Give me a hand here. Hold him down.

926
01:28:29,149 --> 01:28:31,192
God... God!

927
01:28:34,946 --> 01:28:40,160
JEFFERSON MILITARY ACADEMY

928
01:28:41,786 --> 01:28:44,706
It's obviously the column
that raided Newton Station.

929
01:28:44,831 --> 01:28:46,958
That Vicksburg report was just a faint.

930
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:50,462
I thought a brigade of cavalry
was due here.

931
01:28:50,587 --> 01:28:55,925
- They won't get here till late today, sir.
- What you suggest is most extreme.

932
01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:59,429
- My oldest boy here is only 16.
- Damn it, sir!

933
01:28:59,554 --> 01:29:02,849
I beg your pardon, Colonel.
I mean, Reverend...

934
01:29:02,974 --> 01:29:08,480
Look, I've got a boy in my battery that's
14, a man that's 72. This is a war, sir.

935
01:29:08,605 --> 01:29:14,028
I could start lobbing shrapnel and grape
at them critters, catch 'em napping.

936
01:29:14,153 --> 01:29:19,909
Just a show of force, then perhaps we can
hold them off until the cavalry gets here.

937
01:29:20,034 --> 01:29:22,119
- Cadet Major Barksdale.
- Sir?

938
01:29:22,244 --> 01:29:25,539
Assemble your battalion.
The entire complement.

939
01:29:25,664 --> 01:29:28,042
Taylor and Fitcher have the mumps.

940
01:29:29,084 --> 01:29:33,339
Scratch them from the duty roster.
Well, you heard the Lieutenant.

941
01:29:33,464 --> 01:29:36,675
You'll be pleased to inform the corps
we shall move at dawn.

942
01:29:36,801 --> 01:29:38,844
Thank you, sir!

943
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,563
(cock crows)

944
01:30:01,116 --> 01:30:03,160
Attention!

945
01:30:10,668 --> 01:30:15,756
Cadet Major Barksdale, you may move
your column forward. And God bless you.

946
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:19,552
Right shoulder, arms!

947
01:30:23,223 --> 01:30:25,267
Right, face!

948
01:30:26,893 --> 01:30:31,231
Cadets, forward march!

949
01:31:42,512 --> 01:31:46,307
Reverend, my boy Johnny.
He's all I've got left.

950
01:31:46,432 --> 01:31:51,312
First his pa, then his uncles,
his brothers. Now him?

951
01:31:51,437 --> 01:31:56,943
He's all I have left, Reverend.
I'm not going to let him go.

952
01:31:57,068 --> 01:32:00,279
Cadet drummer Buford,
you are relieved of duty.

953
01:32:02,824 --> 01:32:05,076
(boy squealing)

954
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:48,036
I'd save a little of that for Dunker.

955
01:32:49,246 --> 01:32:51,290
I just lost him.

956
01:32:55,043 --> 01:32:57,087
You lost Dunker, eh?

957
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,507
Well, you lost us a good man.

958
01:33:00,632 --> 01:33:04,219
Blood poisoning. Amputation.
A shock to the heart, I guess.

959
01:33:04,344 --> 01:33:08,265
- I wouldn't have had to amputate if he'd...
- lf, maybe, perhaps.

960
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:12,060
- What's the matter, medicine man?
- Section hand, I've had you!

961
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:14,229
Strip your blouse!

962
01:33:22,821 --> 01:33:25,949
I think you're right. Come on.

963
01:33:26,074 --> 01:33:30,370
Orderly! Horses! Bring 'em up!

964
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:44,134
Johnny!

965
01:33:44,885 --> 01:33:46,720
Johnny Buford!

966
01:33:47,429 --> 01:33:48,847
Johnny!

967
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:12,789
- What are the rules, Colonel?
- Just make up your own.

968
01:34:18,294 --> 01:34:20,338
You said no rules, Colonel.

969
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:27,345
On your feet, croaker.

970
01:34:32,559 --> 01:34:34,602
Fire Peter!

971
01:34:45,071 --> 01:34:47,115
Fire Paul!

972
01:35:00,462 --> 01:35:02,505
Fire Paul!

973
01:35:08,679 --> 01:35:11,974
Artillery fire, sir. Hidden battery.

974
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:27,239
Those are nothing but children.
Schoolboys.

975
01:35:27,364 --> 01:35:32,077
- Just some kids from the military school.
- But they keep coming.

976
01:35:41,587 --> 01:35:44,048
Sound assembly.

977
01:35:44,173 --> 01:35:46,217
( bugle)

978
01:36:00,064 --> 01:36:02,733
At least that Holy Joe ain't no kid.

979
01:36:17,123 --> 01:36:19,167
(shouted orders)

980
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,051
Halt! Front rank, kneel!

981
01:36:29,761 --> 01:36:31,555
- Ready!
- Miss Hunter...

982
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:34,558
Aim! Fire!

983
01:36:42,607 --> 01:36:45,861
Rear rank, halt!

984
01:36:45,986 --> 01:36:47,654
Kneel!

985
01:36:47,779 --> 01:36:51,366
Ready! Aim! Fire!

986
01:36:57,289 --> 01:36:59,875
What do you want to do?
Set up a field hospital?

987
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,294
Yes, what are you going to do now?

988
01:37:02,419 --> 01:37:06,256
With all due respect,
I'm going to get the hell out of here.

989
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:08,425
Sound recall!

990
01:37:12,262 --> 01:37:15,140
I told you to take care of this woman!

991
01:37:15,265 --> 01:37:17,851
(explosion)

992
01:37:18,076 --> 01:37:21,913
Colonel, I got me a prisoner.
What do you want me to do with him?

993
01:37:22,038 --> 01:37:25,125
- Spank him.
- On the bottom?

994
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:27,294
Where do you think?

995
01:38:08,294 --> 01:38:11,797
- Halt!
- Hold it, Colonel.

996
01:38:19,096 --> 01:38:22,433
- Report.
- Rebs. They got the whole road blocked.

997
01:38:22,558 --> 01:38:25,394
- How many?
- A full regiment of regulars, sir.

998
01:38:25,519 --> 01:38:29,398
They got two pieces of artillery
and they're digging in along the road.

999
01:38:35,321 --> 01:38:39,076
The only thing to do is fight our way back
to Salt Springs and head east.

1000
01:38:39,201 --> 01:38:44,206
- Haven't you seen that dust?
- Cavalry. Following us for three hours.

1001
01:38:44,331 --> 01:38:50,045
Colonel, the deacon says he knows this
country real good. Don't you, Deacon?

1002
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:54,716
Preaching the gospel, singing the praises
of the Lord hereabouts for years.

1003
01:38:54,841 --> 01:38:57,928
It might be a good idea
to start praying right now.

1004
01:38:58,053 --> 01:39:02,432
The deacon smuggled runaway slaves
north out of here through the swamp.

1005
01:39:02,557 --> 01:39:08,397
- With the underground railway.
- Could you smuggle us out south?

1006
01:39:08,522 --> 01:39:11,024
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1007
01:39:11,149 --> 01:39:14,403
Why, that swamp is full
of quicksand, rattlers...

1008
01:39:14,528 --> 01:39:17,322
The Garden of Eden
had its sufferance too.

1009
01:39:17,447 --> 01:39:23,537
Follow me, brother Colonel, through
the swamps all the way to the river Amite.

1010
01:39:23,662 --> 01:39:26,039
Lead kindly, Lord.

1011
01:39:26,164 --> 01:39:30,377
All right, get yourself
a couple of fresh horses.

1012
01:39:31,837 --> 01:39:34,715
By the right flank, take cover.

1013
01:39:53,776 --> 01:39:55,820
Come on!

1014
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:10,418
(shouts)

1015
01:41:11,647 --> 01:41:13,983
(Marlowe) Come on! Come on!

1016
01:41:14,984 --> 01:41:20,030
Move out. Come on, boy.

1017
01:41:22,658 --> 01:41:24,702
Come on, boy.

1018
01:41:25,077 --> 01:41:28,163
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on!

1019
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:34,587
Keep moving. Stay awake there, kid.

1020
01:41:34,712 --> 01:41:38,215
Keep moving. Pick up your feet.

1021
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:41,510
John, how far do you figure
to Baton Rouge?

1022
01:41:41,635 --> 01:41:43,137
40 miles.

1023
01:41:43,262 --> 01:41:45,306
Keep alive in there!

1024
01:41:45,431 --> 01:41:48,726
- You want me to apologise now or later?
- For what?

1025
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:52,229
- Keep moving!
- I never thought you could do it.

1026
01:41:52,354 --> 01:41:56,901
You know, John, I've given up
all thought of running for Congress.

1027
01:41:57,026 --> 01:42:00,446
With this on my record,
by George, I can be Governor.

1028
01:42:00,571 --> 01:42:02,948
- Keep moving!
- Governor of Michigan.

1029
01:42:03,073 --> 01:42:06,493
And you can name your own job.
Railroad commissioner...

1030
01:42:06,619 --> 01:42:11,498
Don't start making campaign promises
till we get there. Join your regiment.

1031
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,420
Colonel, my duty, medically speaking,
is to inform you

1032
01:42:15,545 --> 01:42:18,506
that these men may make it
on their hands and knees.

1033
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:21,885
We've been 20 hours without a stop.
We need a rest.

1034
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:23,845
I've got eyes, Kendall.

1035
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:27,474
It's also my duty to inform you
that if we run into a fight...

1036
01:42:27,599 --> 01:42:30,185
That is all, Doctor.

1037
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,354
Thank you, sir.

1038
01:43:03,218 --> 01:43:05,262
Column, halt!

1039
01:43:11,184 --> 01:43:13,520
- Woodward.
- Yo!

1040
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:17,232
First squad,
scout the other side of the bridge.

1041
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:21,027
First squad, forward, yo!

1042
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:28,119
(hooves clatter on bridge)

1043
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:43,092
I don't know if you've heard.

1044
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:47,638
Your people are about an hour
behind us, coming fast.

1045
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:50,474
I've heard.

1046
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:55,354
We're going on to Baton Rouge.
We'll leave you here.

1047
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,775
Your own kind can take care of you.

1048
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:03,321
- I'm sure they can.
- Yes.

1049
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,451
I...

1050
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:13,080
I'm sorry for the hardship and...

1051
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:20,379
the humiliation that we've...
that I've caused you.

1052
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:22,548
(gunshots)

1053
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:34,186
Get her out of here!

1054
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:40,025
Recall!

1055
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:42,194
( bugle)

1056
01:44:44,947 --> 01:44:46,990
Get her in that cabin!

1057
01:44:54,248 --> 01:44:56,291
Come on, Miss Hannah.

1058
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:09,680
Looks like they've got us in a trap.

1059
01:45:14,268 --> 01:45:16,061
Knock on it!

1060
01:45:23,443 --> 01:45:25,487
Give us some cover!

1061
01:45:36,915 --> 01:45:39,042
Captain Woodward, move!

1062
01:45:40,085 --> 01:45:42,129
(gunfire continues)

1063
01:45:50,805 --> 01:45:52,849
Leave me alone.

1064
01:45:52,974 --> 01:45:56,269
I'm all right. Let me alone, would you?

1065
01:46:06,779 --> 01:46:08,406
Easy.

1066
01:46:08,531 --> 01:46:12,785
Get Colonel Secord right away.
Not that way, the other door.

1067
01:46:12,911 --> 01:46:17,040
- Report.
- It's alive with rebs. At least two cannons.

1068
01:46:17,165 --> 01:46:20,084
- They jumped us so quick.
- Infantry?

1069
01:46:20,209 --> 01:46:23,087
- The wood's full of 'em.
- Join your troop.

1070
01:46:23,212 --> 01:46:26,674
- Cut his boot off, Sam.
- Nobody's cutting that boot off.

1071
01:46:26,799 --> 01:46:28,843
Cut his boot off.

1072
01:46:33,306 --> 01:46:35,433
Take a good stiff jolt.

1073
01:46:38,436 --> 01:46:41,439
Those are $20 boots, trooper.

1074
01:46:45,818 --> 01:46:47,946
- Get some water.
- Who, me?

1075
01:46:54,786 --> 01:46:58,791
Take A-troop and that reverend,
or whatever he is.

1076
01:46:58,916 --> 01:47:04,672
Find a ford someway across that river.
Flank 'em. Take a bugler with you.

1077
01:47:04,797 --> 01:47:08,300
Sir, thank you for the opportunity.

1078
01:47:51,218 --> 01:47:54,513
John, it's a trap.
They want us to cross that bridge.

1079
01:47:54,638 --> 01:47:57,016
It'd be like going through a funnel.

1080
01:47:57,141 --> 01:48:04,148
In a position like this, there's nothing
disgraceful about honourable surrender.

1081
01:48:04,273 --> 01:48:08,653
Get back to your troop.
Keep 'em under cover.

1082
01:48:08,778 --> 01:48:12,490
- You mean... you're going on?
- Get out of here!

1083
01:48:14,534 --> 01:48:17,078
You're not going far with that bullet in you.

1084
01:48:17,203 --> 01:48:21,833
You're taking your own sweet time
about cutting it out of there.

1085
01:48:21,958 --> 01:48:26,379
You're not the only wounded man
here, Colonel. Get me my bag.

1086
01:48:26,504 --> 01:48:29,466
Now, this is going to hurt a little.

1087
01:48:30,383 --> 01:48:33,470
Go on with it, Kendall.

1088
01:48:33,595 --> 01:48:36,640
- Ooh!
- Keep that leg stretched.

1089
01:48:38,808 --> 01:48:40,852
Probe, please.

1090
01:49:02,958 --> 01:49:05,293
(Marlowe yelps)

1091
01:49:08,004 --> 01:49:10,048
Are you having fun?

1092
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:20,184
You're lucky.

1093
01:49:25,773 --> 01:49:31,654
You may not believe it, Colonel,
but I bought you some time.

1094
01:49:31,779 --> 01:49:36,075
- A couple of hours?
- Maybe more.

1095
01:49:37,034 --> 01:49:38,869
Thanks.

1096
01:49:51,299 --> 01:49:57,138
- First Michigan in position, sir.
- First Illinois in position. We were first.

1097
01:49:58,306 --> 01:50:00,349
I'm all right.

1098
01:50:08,774 --> 01:50:10,818
Get cracking.

1099
01:50:33,717 --> 01:50:36,303
God Almighty. Here he comes.

1100
01:50:40,057 --> 01:50:42,100
Mount up.

1101
01:50:43,393 --> 01:50:45,938
You heard me, Kirby. Mount up.

1102
01:50:46,063 --> 01:50:49,524
You heard the Colonel! Mount up!

1103
01:51:07,501 --> 01:51:09,419
Colonel.

1104
01:51:09,544 --> 01:51:13,882
The deacon found a place to ford.
The men ought to be in position by now.

1105
01:51:14,007 --> 01:51:19,096
Thanks. Cover our rear.
See how much time we've got.

1106
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:21,265
Yes, sir.

1107
01:51:34,611 --> 01:51:38,574
- Where's your horse?
- Back in the swamp, sir.

1108
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:45,373
- Lips dry?
- Yes, sir. But my bugle ain't.

1109
01:51:49,252 --> 01:51:53,047
- Uncase the colours.
- You heard him.

1110
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:09,105
- You know your orders?
- You're not fit. Let me lead this charge.

1111
01:52:09,230 --> 01:52:12,984
With a success like this,
I could land in the White House.

1112
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:15,904
- We'll probably all land in the...
- (gunfire)

1113
01:52:16,029 --> 01:52:18,656
Get back to your regiment!

1114
01:52:18,781 --> 01:52:21,242
Bugler, sound charge!

1115
01:52:23,036 --> 01:52:25,079
( bugle)

1116
01:52:42,347 --> 01:52:45,308
Forwards! Fire Paul.

1117
01:52:55,194 --> 01:52:57,238
Company!

1118
01:54:04,556 --> 01:54:06,558
You're hurt, sir.

1119
01:54:06,683 --> 01:54:09,311
Blow... Trumpet, blow.

1120
01:54:27,704 --> 01:54:29,748
They can't give up.

1121
01:54:30,665 --> 01:54:34,878
Maybe it's crazy, maybe it's brave.
Don't ask me to explain it. Nobody can.

1122
01:54:35,003 --> 01:54:38,298
Come on, we're going to have
a lot of work to do.

1123
01:54:46,222 --> 01:54:49,726
Bugler, sound recall.

1124
01:55:00,278 --> 01:55:02,530
Got any more?

1125
01:55:05,617 --> 01:55:08,203
Come on, give us some more.

1126
01:55:16,003 --> 01:55:19,090
How much longer, Sergeant?
Sergeant Major.

1127
01:55:19,215 --> 01:55:23,636
- Pretty near ready, sir.
- All right, boys! Hurry it up! Lay it in!

1128
01:55:23,761 --> 01:55:25,805
Knock on it!

1129
01:55:36,274 --> 01:55:39,902
Come on out! Get out of there!

1130
01:55:43,406 --> 01:55:46,659
- Can those men be moved?
- They're all critical.

1131
01:55:46,784 --> 01:55:49,287
- May I speak to them?
- I'd rather you didn't.

1132
01:55:49,412 --> 01:55:52,915
They've got to be quiet.
I've given them all the laudanum I have.

1133
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,627
It's a lousy finish for good men.

1134
01:55:56,752 --> 01:55:59,839
There'll be a medic with that reb column.
Get your horse.

1135
01:55:59,964 --> 01:56:02,633
I can't count on that.

1136
01:56:02,758 --> 01:56:04,885
You mean you're staying?

1137
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:08,389
- Medicine's where you find it.
- Even in Andersonville?

1138
01:56:08,514 --> 01:56:10,558
Even in Andersonville.

1139
01:56:12,268 --> 01:56:17,231
I wouldn't blame you if you slap it away.
Shake hands?

1140
01:56:18,482 --> 01:56:22,904
- Doctor, Major Gray.
- All right, coming.

1141
01:56:23,029 --> 01:56:25,616
When your next doctor
takes that bandage off...

1142
01:56:25,741 --> 01:56:28,160
I know. Tree moss.

1143
01:56:28,285 --> 01:56:30,412
So longer, croaker.

1144
01:56:30,537 --> 01:56:32,789
Take care, section hand.

1145
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:03,195
You're tired. You've helped a lot.
Thanks for it.

1146
01:57:04,404 --> 01:57:09,159
A poor way of being grateful
after what I've put you through.

1147
01:57:10,244 --> 01:57:15,415
- You'd better be going.
- Yes, I guess I'd better.

1148
01:57:18,085 --> 01:57:21,046
Look, Hannah Hunter.

1149
01:57:21,171 --> 01:57:25,092
Thank God I won't be the cause
of hurting you any more.

1150
01:57:25,217 --> 01:57:28,595
Because it happens I'm in love with you.

1151
01:57:30,681 --> 01:57:32,724
( distant bugle)

1152
01:57:32,849 --> 01:57:36,020
Tell her the rest when you get back.

1153
01:58:09,262 --> 01:58:12,098
- One of your own, sir.
- Get going.

1154
01:58:12,223 --> 01:58:14,892
Colonel, they're right on my tail.

1155
01:58:42,712 --> 01:58:44,881
(Marlowe) Let's go.

1156
01:59:18,123 --> 01:59:21,835
Doctor, could our regimental surgeon
be of any service to you?

1157
01:59:21,961 --> 01:59:24,004
I'd be grateful.
