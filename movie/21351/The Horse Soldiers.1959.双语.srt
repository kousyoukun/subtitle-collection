123
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,757
- Logan, is Brady ready?  
- Yes, sir.
- 洛根, 布雷迪准备好了吗?  
- 是的,先生.

124
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,134
Oh, a photograph... [trails off]
哦, 准备拍照…  (慢慢地)

125
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,555
Move away, move away. Move back.
移动，移动. 退后点.

126
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,806
Are you ready for us, Brady?
你为我们准备好了吗, 布雷迪?

127
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,350
[indistinct chatter]
 (模糊地聊着)

128
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,271
[man] Colonel. Sit down, Colonel.
(人)上校. 坐下来, 上校.

129
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,025
- Thank you very much. 
- That's all right.
- 非常感谢你. 
- 好极了.

130
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,986
[Brady] Sit down, Marlowe. No hats, please, gentlemen.
(布雷迪)坐下来,马洛. 请摘掉帽子，先生们.

131
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,534
That's right. Nice and relaxed.
这才对. 放松点.

132
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:02,374
Now, roses are red, violets are blue, the camera's looking straight at you.
现在, 玫瑰是红色的, 紫罗兰是蓝色的, 相机正对着你.

133
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,502
Oh, I must have another one. That man in the white coat moved.
哦, 还有另外一个. 那个穿白色外套的人移动一下.

134
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,048
That isn't all he'll be moving before long. Sorry General, is that all?
这不是他将不久会移动.
对不起将军，都讲完了吗?

135
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,677
- That's all. Thank you, Mr. Brady.
- Kendall.
- 都讲完了. 谢谢，布雷迪先生.
- 肯德尔.

136
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,303
Thank you, General. Thank you very much.
谢谢你, 将军. 非常感谢你.

137
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,309
Sit down.
坐下.

138
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,438
Colonel, I gather you're not too happy about my going along.
上校, 我猜你不高兴我去.

139
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,149
I hadn't counted on you, that's all.
我没有指望你, 仅此而已.

140
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,070
I can understand your reasons for trying to avoid a fight,
我能理解你试图避免战斗的理由,

141
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,783
tactically speaking. But you're going very deep into enemy territory.
但从战术上来说. 你会很深入到敌占区.

142
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,412
Tell me, what did you intend to do about your wounded?
告诉我, 对于你的伤员你打算做什么?

143
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,915
I intend to move, and move fast.
我打算行动, 快速行动.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,834
Those too badly shot up to carry on
那些太糟的伤员得坚持下去

145
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,336
will be left to the clemency of the enemy.
他们将会由仁慈的敌人来决定.

146
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,007
- Civilian or military.
- Including yourself?
- 平民或军人.
- 包括你自己吗?

147
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,091
Naturally.
理所当然的.

148
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,930
That's a pretty primitive attitude. Medically speaking.
从医学上来讲，这是一个非常原始的态度.

149
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,227
Well, Doctor, war isn't exactly a civilized business.
好吧, 医生, 战争并不是一个文明的业务.

150
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:09,608
Of course, I realize that it gives you fellas a wider field of opportunity...
当然, 我认为它将给你的伙计们更广领域的机会……

151
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,236
- For experimenting, Colonel?
- I didn't say that.
- 为了试验, 上校?
- 我没说.

152
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,196
- Mitch.
- Yes, sir?
- 米奇.
- 是的, 先生?

153
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,867
- Give the doctor a full roster.
- Yes, sir.
- 给医生一个完整的名单
- 是的, 先生.

154
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,702
Examine every man.
检查每个人.

155
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,331
Throw out any man who, in your unchallenged opinion,
淘汰任何你的不受挑战的观点的人，

156
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,541
of course, is unfit.
当然，是不合格的人.

157
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,878
Even those who might get sick a week from today.
即使是从今天起那些可能生病一个星期的人.

158
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,633
Look, Colonel, I didn't ask to be assigned to this mission.
看, 上校, 我没有要求接受这个任务.

159
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,219
I'm a military doctor. I've been ordered to go and I'm going to do my job.
我是军医. 得按命令去执行自己的本职工作.

160
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,263
So get off my back.
因此不要跟我罗嗦.

161
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,733
- Bugler!
- Yes, sir?
- 吹号手！
- 是，先生？

162
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,026
Get me Mitchell.
给我把米切尔叫来.

163
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,153
Sergeant Major Mitchell's in the hospital, sir.
米切尔军士长在医院里, 先生.

164
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,335
- How old are you?
- 32, sir.
- 你多大了？
- 三十二岁了，先生.

165
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,129
Join that group.
加入这个组.

166
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,264
Hang on, son. Here we go.

167
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,352
Yow!

168
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,064
[metal clanks]

169
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,526
This is going to hurt worse.

170
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,078
There. He'll be all right.

171
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,045
- I got your sick list, Kendall.
- Good. I'm glad it's a short one.

172
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,839
We'll let that drain full out.

173
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,883
- I approve of that, Doctor.
- The lad had quite a boil.

174
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,178
I didn't come here to watch you
carving anybody's behind.

175
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,808
- Why's Mitchell's name on that list?
- Sir, we observe quiet here.

176
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,060
- What's this?
- Hoppy, this is Colonel Marlowe.

177
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,939
How do you do? Stand in line.
We'll take care of you presently.

178
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,694
- Is he going with us?
- He's a good man. I need him.

179
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,238
And I need Mitchell.
He's strong as a bull...

180
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,656
Let me show you something.

181
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:32,250
Colonel, I've been trying to tell the
doctor that this is nothing unusual.

182
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,002
No, not for a man with malaria.

183
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,255
There's nothing new about this, Kendall.

184
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,092
I've seen him ride 40 miles
in one day, shivering in his saddle.

185
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,637
- He's had malaria twice as long as...
- So you concur in my diagnosis.

186
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,015
Come on Mitch, get out of bed.
I got some whiskey in my tent.

187
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,267
You stay where you are, Sergeant.

188
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,436
I was ordered to take off
the duty roster any man who,

189
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,605
in my unchallenged opinion, was unfit.

190
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,610
He's sick and he's going to stay here.
Those are my orders.

191
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,779
You've read the whole book, haven't you?

192
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,242
[kicks buckets]

193
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,955
Oh, Colonel!

194
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,792
We got that fella
with all them stripes for you.

195
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,669
- Bring him in.
- We hauled him right off the train.

196
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,174
- Sergeant Kirby reporting, sir.
- Well, Kirby.

197
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,093
Besides being slightly drunk,
what's got you riled up?

198
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,888
They got me in town.
Pulled me off the train.

199
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,432
Just gotten filled.
My first in two years.

200
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,185
They tell me you're good. You better be.

201
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,480
You're replacing the best soldier
in the regiment.

202
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:40,068
- I expect you to be happy about that.
- I could be happier where I was going.

203
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,738
- You got me there.
- No, sir, you got me here.

204
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,740
- Sir.
- Sir.

205
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,827
Alright, march this sergeant
down to the river and throw him in.

206
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,829
- Clothes and all?
- Clothes and all.

207
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,332
Pump him full of black coffee
till it runs out his ears.

208
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,961
Kirby, when you come back,
come back sober. You've got two hours.

209
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,297
- Parades, Nashville...
- You can leave that keg.

210
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,260
You're welcome to it... sir.

211
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,972
Kirby, you tangle with me
and I'll have your hide.

212
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,100
You're welcome to that too, sir.
If it's in the line of duty.

213
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,030

Wait on here a minute.

00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,107
The sun, it raises in the
east every time, don't it?

235
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,358
It sure does in Missouri.

236
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,820
For eight hours, with no turning,
we've been heading this way.

237
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,365
Now, if'n the sun raises in the east,
what direction is that?

238
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,244
- It ain't north.
- Course not. It's south.

Hey, we've been riding smack-dab
into reb territory.

[blows bugle]

248
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,159
Just a patrol, sir. No sign of any
major force, as far as I could tell.

249
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,954
The fact remains we've been spotted.

250
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,413
The word's out for sure now.

251
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:49,210
They'll be back here with
everything available looking for us.

252
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,130
All right, Ned,
you can prepare to turn back.

253
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,550
That's a bad mistake, John,
splitting the force.

254
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,220
Now you need every man you've got.
Diversion be damned.

255
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,556
We've got to make them think that
we all turned back.

256
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,182
Oh, sure, sure.

257
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,811
But you out to remember that from now
on, every Johnny Reb with a gun

258
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,647
is going to be hiding behind a tree
trying to make a name for himself.

259
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,734
And you want to cut your force
by one third! Aw, John, listen to me.

260
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,489
There's an old axiom in politics:
you never split your ballot...

Richard, when the horses are watered
and the men are fed, we'll move out.

262
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,077
Yes, sir.

263
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,505
[man] Hey, Doctor.

264
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,552
These here contraband children say
there's something wrong at that cabin.

265
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,429
I guess they need a doctor.

266
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,352
All right.

267
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,613
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes, I am.

268
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,584
What happened?

269
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,171
It's Rainey, sir. Rainey the first.
He's dead.

270
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,466
Carry on.

271
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,554
Where's Kendall?

272
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,892
Dr. Kendall went over to that cabin
with some young colored people.

273
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,977
- An emergency, I believe.
- He what?!

274
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,940
He went over to that cabin
with some young colored people.

275
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,323
- Are you the doctor too?
- What? No, no.

276
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,249
[baby crying]

277
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,842
Kendall, what the devil are you doing?

278
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,596
We just delivered a baby.

279
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,722
It's a little girl.

280
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,103
You can take care of her now, Granny.

281
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,187
You're going to be all right.

282
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,740
We've got a couple of wounded men
out there, you know.

283
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,200
No, one's dead.

284
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,414
One's gone, one's born.

285
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,292
It's an amazing process, isn't it?

286
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:38,629
As many as I've delivered,
it never fails to awe me.

287
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,550
All right, children, you got a new
sister. Go in, take a look at her.

288
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,809
All right, Kendall.
Go back and take care of your wounded.

289
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,812
They'll be all right.
Hopkins knows what to do.

290
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:59,900
You're not a country sawbones. You're
an officer in the Union Army under oath.

291
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,654
I took an older oath before that one.

292
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:08,326
They didn't seem to be having any
trouble having babies around here

293
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,618
before you arrived.

294
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,330
I was sent for and I was asked to help
and I couldn't turn 'em down.

295
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,498
Now come off it Colonel.
Even you were born.

296
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,419
As of right now,
you are under officer's arrest.

297
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,837
Insubordination.

298
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,008
Do I still carry out my duties, sir?

299
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,761
From now on,
you'll confine them to the troops.

300
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,845
Very well, sir.

301
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,098
Don't push me too far, Kendall.

302
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,528
[men singing march]

303
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:12,139
Forward! Ho!

304
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,430
[dogs barking]

305
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,186
Lukey, what are the dogs
raising such a fuss about?

306
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,189
Dogs? You know how dogs
make such a fuss.

307
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,873
- Soldiers, Miss Hannah. Lots of 'em.
- Soldiers? How wonderful!

308
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,311
Thunder in the outhouse.
Them's Yankees.

309
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,481
Lukey, you go on downstairs
and meet them.

310
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,982
Lukey, do you hear?

311
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,238
[knocking]

312
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,241
[dog whining]

313
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,007
Come here, girl.

314
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,635
Come on.

315
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:19,558
- Who lives here?
- Miss Hannah Hunter lives here.

316
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,479
Tell her I want to see her.
Colonel Marlowe, Union Army.

317
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,730
Yes, sir.

318
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,275
Put that gun away.

319
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,804
- Sorry for this intrusion, ma'am.
- It isn't that, Colonel.

320
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:01,141
It's just that I never prepared myself
to see that uniform

321
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,143
within the walls of this house.

322
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,189
Ma'am, we no more wish to be here
than you do to have us.

323
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,401
Why, that's gallantly spoken, Colonel.

324
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,404
No matter what our...
well, our differences,

325
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,990
I fear I'm forgetting the amenities.

326
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,284
- Welcome to Greenbriar, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

327
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,246
Lukey, take the gentlemen's hats.

328
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,877
Uh...

329
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,172
- Sergeant Kirby.
- Sergeant.

330
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,882
Ma'am.

331
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:39,263
Well, shall we make ourselves
more comfortable in the Rose Room?

332
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,600
No, thank you, ma'am.
We'll only stay a moment.

333
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,144
You and your men are riding on?

334
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,814
No, we will bivouac
in your woods for the night.

335
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,775
Sleeping on the cold, cold ground?

336
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,947
When is this awful, wasteful,
terrible struggle going to end, Colonel?

337
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,282
Why, brother against brother...

338
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:03,829
And during our stay no one will
be allowed to leave the premises.

339
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,540
And wherever would we go, Colonel?

340
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,211
I'm sure you must agree that this war
makes loneliness for everyone.

341
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,049
Also, I must commandeer most
of the grain and horses,

342
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,216
if you have any.

343
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:21,388
You will be paid, Miss Hunter,
for everything, in Union greenbacks.

344
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,391
We will not bother you
any longer. Good evening.

345
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,686
- Kirby.
- By your leave, ma'am.

346
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,523
Why Hannah Hunter, what's got hold
of you, talking like a field hand?

347
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,860
- You alls, we alls.
- Yankees! [sighs]

348
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,614
[spits]

349
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,951
It's uncanny, Colonel.

350
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,664
I've heard about 'em,
but I didn't believe it.

351
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,666
I'll have you know,
I received my commission

352
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,959
from the Governor from
the sovereign state of Michigan!

353
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,629
- Young man...
- What's your question?

354
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:58,008
The question is this man's authority
in his present position.

355
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,720
As usual, I am trying to present
the grim facts of life.

356
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,473
Colonel Secord doesn't understand
that coffee tastes better

357
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,851
if the latrines are dug
downstream instead of upstream.

358
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,522
- How do you like your coffee, Colonel?
- [laughing]

359
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,857
- Ah, Secord, you oughta...
- Pardon.

360
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,819
Oh, Colonel! Colonel Marlowe!

361
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,493
I am forgetting my manners.
Why, how I ever...

362
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,164
Well, I don't believe
I've met these gentlemen.

363
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:35,379
Miss Hunter. Colonel Secord.
Major Gray. Major Kendall.

364
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,463
Ma'am.

365
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,008
[giggles] I'm just so scatterbrained.

366
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:44,012
Poor Papa and Mama must be
turning over in their graves at me

367
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,809
for not extending what little
hospitality Greenbriar can offer.

368
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,396
At least I can extend an invitation
to you and your officers for dinner.

369
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,566
- No, Miss Hunter...
- I insist.

370
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,068
There's three fat capons
that have to go anyhow.

371
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:03,699
What with our store of grain
being reduced, like you mentioned.

372
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,202
So, you see, you brought it
on yourself, didn't you?

373
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,289
Speaking for myself,
I would be delighted...

374
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:14,668
Very well, thank you.
Hot food is pretty hard to turn down.

375
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,504
Splendid. Now, how many can I count on?

376
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,257
- Would five or six be...?
- Not at all.

377
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,634
Perfectly wonderful.

378
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,511
At nine, gentlemen?

379
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,097
- Colonel Secord?
- Of the First Michigan, ma'am.

380
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,475
- Major Gray?
- Ma'am.

381
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,894
Major... Kendall, isn't it?

382
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,149
I'm afraid I'll have to regret, ma'am.
It's not of my choice, I assure you.

383
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,777
At the moment, I'm under arrest.

384
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,363
We will all be glad to accept
the invitation, Miss Hunter.

385
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,839
Ma'am?

386
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,425
You dropped your handkerchief.

387
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,638
Care for a little more,
Colonel Secord?

388
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:12,601
- No, thank you, ma'am.
- Colonel Marlowe?

389
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,562
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come now, Colonel.

390
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,066
A man with a big frame like yours
can’t just nibble away

391
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,652
like a little old titmouse.

392
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,822
Gentlemen, please be seated.

393
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:30,661
Now, what was your preference?
The leg... or the breast?

394
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,835
I've had quite enough of both,
thank you.

395
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,504
Oh... What a shame.

396
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,011
- Would anyone else like some more?
- [all] No, thank you.

397
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:53,851
Gentlemen, be seated.
I must warn you too, there's no coffee.

398
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,437
And a sweet or a dessert of any kind
was just out of the question.

399
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,524
Sugar's $150 a barrel.

400
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,612
"And yet your fair discourse
hath been as sweet as sugar,

401
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,157
making the hard way
sweet and delectable."

402
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,659
[men cheer]

403
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,371
How perfectly charming.
A little something of your own?

404
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,456
No, ma'am. Richard II.

405
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,670
- By profession, I'm an actor.
- Why, how fascinating!

406
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:25,674
Why, Major Ken... [gasps] Your cigar.
Gentlemen, please be seated.

407
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,844
[sighs]

408
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:35,392
Major Kendall a doctor. And
Colonel Secord almost a congressman.

409
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,605
And you an actor.
And now all military men.

410
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,441
Such a waste of talent.

411
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,026
But, of course, Colonel Marlowe,

412
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,821
I imagine that you are
a professional soldier.

413
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,742
No, prior to this insanity,
I was a railroad engineer.

414
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,453
Why, how thrilling.

415
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:59,833
To think of being able to steer one of
those huge things, puffing and steaming.

416
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,503
Ringing that little bell.
Ding-dong! Ding-dong!

417
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,841
Not quite. My job was
in the construction of railroads.

418
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,929
Why, my! Such brilliant minds.

419
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:17,100
Poor little me barely squeezed through
Miss Longstreet's Seminary for Ladies.

420
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,980
How did you ever manage
to remember all those books in college?

421
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,440
I didn't.

422
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:27,945
I started driving rail spikes
at ten cents a day and found.

423
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,572
And now, Miss Hunter,
I must ask you to leave us.

424
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:35,744
We are taking the privilege of using
this room for an hour or two. If we may.

425
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,499
Of course, but wouldn't you prefer
using another room? The study, perhaps?

426
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,044
- We're quite comfortable here.
- [men chatter in agreement]

427
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,089
I'm sorry,
but I must be rude and explain.

428
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:51,969
You see, Lukey and I must be in the
fields by five in the morning.

429
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,595
Gentlemen, go ahead
and light your cigars.

430
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,472
- [all] Thank you, ma'am.
- And you see, all this...

431
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,141
- Allow me.
- Thank you kindly.

432
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,144
All this and the dishes must be done
before she can get to bed.

433
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,315
- Am I being too inconsiderate?
- Of course not, ma'am.

434
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,610
- May I?
- Of course. This way, gentlemen.

435
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,904
- [all chattering]
- [man] How wonderful.

436
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,241
[man] Really, I thought it was a
charming dinner.

437
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,333
- Post this room.
- Yes, sir.

438
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,878
- I hope you'll be comfortable here.
- Oh, yes. This is fine.

439
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,092
Now, if you wish to light a fire,
it's all ready.

440
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,301
No, it's fine.

441
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:38,598
- Some brandy. I'll have Lukey bring it.
- No, thank you, no brandy.

442
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,518
Are you sure there's
nothing more that I can...

443
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,270
Oh, yes. Uh...

444
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,023
Doctor, there's no need
for you to be a part of this.

445
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:50,110
Perhaps Miss Hunter would show you
some of the beauties of Greenbriar.

446
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,697
Why, of course,
if he has any interest...

447
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,949
He'd be pleased to.

448
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,785
Very well. Come, then, Doctor.

449
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,708
I noticed a lovely garden outside.
Shall we take a stroll?

450
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,377
Why, of course.

451
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,173
You know, you gentlemen must be
comfortable in your heavy uniforms,

452
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:16,053
but I feel a definite chill in the
air... it's me and my thin blood.

453
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,555
Would you excuse me
while I go and fetch a shawl?

454
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,475
- Miss Hunter.
- Yes, Major?

455
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,353
I'm afraid I'll have to go with you.

456
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,898
Upstairs? With me?

457
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,275
- Why, Major!
- You're only getting a shawl.

458
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,528
Of course,
but in these parts it's unheard of...

459
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,364
It's something spicy
to tell your grandchildren.

460
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,327
This is war. At the moment,
Greenbriar is a military installation.

461
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:45,290
I don't suppose there's any real harm,
being that you're a doctor.

462
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,374
That's right.

463
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,009
Lukey, bring some brandy
to my sitting room, please.

464
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,351
I hope you'll be
comfortable here, Major.

465
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,727
Thank you.

466
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,579
Thank you.

467
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,091
Hey! Where are you going with that?

468
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:40,011
- Miss Hannah asked for this brandy.
- Yeah, yeah, I know, for the Major.

469
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:44,850
We never give any of our top-ranking
officers an unlabeled bottle,

470
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,852
unless somebody tastes it first.

471
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,814
- Is this what you does? Test things?
- Certainly.

472
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:55,569
See that second stripe? That means
I'm official taster for majors on up.

473
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,824
- Here's La Grange.
- [man] Mm-hm.

474
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:06,121
We've come down here
approximately 80 miles.

475
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,832
We're headed for Newton Station.

476
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,835
[Gray] Any word on
the enemy strength there?

477
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:16,339
No, not a word. Whatever it is,
we're obliged to take it on.

478
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,343
- Good. Maybe we'll see action.
- This is not play-acting.

479
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,142
- Here's your brandy, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

480
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:31,521
- And it's all tested.
- Tested?

481
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,065
By the man downstairs with
those tester's stripes,

482
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,859
for majors on up.

483
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,112
Oh, yes. Sergeant Kirby.

484
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,283
- He really tested it, didn't he?
- Yes, sir. Twice.

485
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,535
- [Hannah] Lukey?
- Yes, Miss Hannah.

486
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,456
Excuse me, sir.

487
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,509
<i>[Marlowe] ...very lucky.</i>

488
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,519
<i>[men chattering in study]</i>

489
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:19,527
That is the next piece of information.
We're not going back to La Grange.

490
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,573
- We're what?
- We're not going back north.

491
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:29,663
We're heading south to Baton Rouge
to join up with the Union forces there.

492
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,709
- Great Scott, when did you decide that?
- It's the best way. It's the only way.

493
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:41,925
John, it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to Baton Rouge.

494
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,096
And it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to La Grange.

495
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,474
Only the rebs will really have been
closed in behind us,

496
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,643
ready to chew us to bits.

497
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,938
So we'll go out the way
they least expect: straight south.

498
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,648
Damn it John, it's suicide.

499
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,485
Why we couldn't... Is it possible your
orders could have been misinterpreted?

500
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,779
My only duty after Newton Station

501
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,032
is to get as many of these men
back alive as I can.

502
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,455
[Secord] And so I still must protest.

503
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,792
And what's more, I want that
on the record for General Hurlburt.

504
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,003
It is impetuous mass suicide.

505
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,089
[Marlowe] It's on the record,
but get this.

506
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,717
Unless enemy action
allows you to take my place,

507
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,510
that's the way it will be.

508
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,139
Blow Newton Station off the map,
then through to Baton Rouge.

509
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,766
There will be no change.
Do you understand?

510
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,352
[Secord] All right, you're in command.

511
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:38,690
[Marlowe] Now let's go over it again.
Straight through to Baton Rouge.

512
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,233
We will not turn back.

513
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,282
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Was the brandy satisfactory?

514
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,826
- Excellent. Won't you join me?
- Goodness me, no.

515
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,953
I never touch spirits.

516
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:56,583
My papa taught me that a girl ought
to keep her wits about her at all times.

517
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,877
Your father raised a very smart girl.

518
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,838
You're just being sweet.
Would you like to see the garden?

519
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,340
Didn't you forget your shawl?

520
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,052
Why, Lukey!

521
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,561
Now, Lukey, you take
that tray downstairs

522
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,646
and go about doing what you have to do.

523
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,276
You know, I remember the first time
I tried spirits,

524
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,362
at the Governor's Ball in Jackson.

525
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:30,992
My escort, Adam Lovelace from Biloxi,
well, he gave me a mint julep.

526
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,871
You know, those Lovelace boys
are all very handsome, but fast,

527
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,414
if you know what I mean.

528
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,584
Well, if I could tell you the thoughts
that went on in my mind

529
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,379
after that one julep... My!

530
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,006
I'd rather know the thoughts
going on in your mind right now.

531
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,222
- Kendall, what in the name of...?
- Ah-ah-ah. Sorry we have to interrupt.

532
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,724
Maybe we out to ask them
what they think your chances are

533
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,685
of blowing up Newton Station
and getting to Baton Rouge.

534
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,605
- Are you drunk?
- Unfortunately, no.

535
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,400
They were listening upstairs.

536
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,448
Makes a pretty good stethoscope.

537
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,120
Don't feel too guilty.
I was slower to catch on than you.

538
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,205
Where were you, Kendall?

539
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,417
Well, a gentlemen thinks twice
before peeking into a lady's bedroom,

540
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,627
but sometimes it pays off.

541
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,548
Looks like she's made
a fool out of both of us.

542
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,925
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

543
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,052
[sighs]

544
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,847
You know something, Miss Hunter?

545
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,182
You have put me
to quite an inconvenience.

546
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,768
At least I've
accomplished something, sir.

547
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,521
I don't suppose I could accept
your word of honor

548
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,982
not to discuss this with anyone else.

549
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,984
I don't hold to honor
with any Yankees.

550
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,318
Exactly.

551
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,363
So the whole state of Mississippi
will be alerted.

552
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,575
So could you possibly suggest
what I should do with you?

553
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,370
I noticed she was getting on your
nerves. Now's your chance to shoot her.

554
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,541
- One more word out of you...
- Go ahead. Shoot us.

555
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:06,087
Shoot both of us. But you'll never
get away with the rest of your filthy,

556
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,466
murdering plans, Mr. Colonel Marlowe.

557
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,470
You Yankees and your holy principle
about saving the Union.

558
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,015
You're plundering pirates, that's what.

559
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,685
You think there's no Confederate army
where you're going?

560
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:24,814
Do you think our boys
are asleep down here?

561
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,358
They'll catch up to you
and they'll cut you to pieces,

562
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,279
you nameless, fatherless scum!

563
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,575
[sobs] And I wish I could be there
to see it.

564
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,287
If it happens, Miss Hunter, you will be.

565
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,765
- [man] Hurry it up.
- [man 2] All right.

566
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,304
You're an excellent rider, Miss Hunter.

567
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,475
Right interesting country, isn't it?

568
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,315
I'm more interested in why you vandals
confiscated my dead father's clothes.

569
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,525
Well, they're for our cadets.

570
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,945
- Scouts.
- Scouts!

571
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,989
Spies, you mean.

572
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:42,368
It's a wonder they don't crawl along
on their bellies like snakes.

573
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,122
You'll find out what happens
to spies down here.

574
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:50,043
My personal experience with spies
is limited. I've only known one.

575
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,713
Do you mind, Major?
I prefer to ride alone.

576
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,257
Ma'am.

577
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,265
Miss Hannah!

578
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,155
All right, forward! Yo-oh!

579
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,243
Back in line, Doctor.

580
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,335
[Hannah screams]

581
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,693
Well.

582
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,905
- These lady's drawers are almost dry.
- Yeah.

583
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,118
Aren't you getting a little chilly?

584
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,370
Don't tell me you're concerned
about my health.

585
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,957
If I give you back your clothes,
will you promise not to run away again?

586
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:17,714
I would, ma'am. There's a point
where pride becomes impractical.

587
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,633
Actually, if you could get a look
at yourself, I'd think you'd agree.

588
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,848
Very well. I do wish to keep my health.

589
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,934
- I shall not try to run away again.
- Your word of honor?

590
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,188
- My word of honor.
- To Yankees?

591
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,776
- To Yankees.
- Cross your heart?

592
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,945
- I gave you my word!
- All right, Lukey.

593
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,739
Help Miss Hunter with her clothes.

594
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,035
I'm glad you're being sensible.
You were beginning to worry me.

595
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,914
- From a medical standpoint.
- Thank you, Doctor.

596
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,875
I wish I could be of further assistance,

597
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,129
but fortunately you Southern people
have your own help.

598
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,068
[Kirby] Attention! Eyes front!

599
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,539
[man] Rebs, sir!

600
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,627
Hopping that riverbank.
A full brigade, coming fast.

601
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,173
Horse, foot and artillery, sir.
It ain't militia, neither.

602
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,258
- How far?
- Ten minutes.

603
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,093
All right, get out of sight,
get in those trees.

604
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,312
Enemy patrol. Take cover and choke up.

605
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:00,066
- Bugler!
- Not bugler, you idiot! Hand signals.

606
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,323
Enemy across the river.
Move out. Keep it quiet.

607
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,201
Why doesn't he stand and fight?
He's got a full brigade.

608
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,507
[rebel troops sing
<i>The Bonnie Blue Flag]</i>

609
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,688
<i>¶ Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>
<i>For Southern rights, hurrah!</i>

610
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:43,109
<i>¶ Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag</i>
<i>That bears a single star</i>

611
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:47,530
<i>¶ Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>
<i>For Southern rights, hurrah!</i>

612
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:51,784
<i>¶ Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag</i>
<i>That bears a single star ¶</i>

613
00:47:56,623 --> 00:48:00,418
- [horse snorts]
- Take it easy. Oh!

614
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,129
Come on, stop it.

615
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,052
[singing continues]

616
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,338
Hannah!

617
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,429
Hey! Help! Over here!
[shrieks]

618
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,556
[muffled screams]

619
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,641
Ouch!

620
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,684
Let go with those teeth!

621
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,022
- I've got 800 men out there.
- Get some water.

622
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,208
Looks to be all clear across the river.

623
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,626
Well...

624
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,305
[gasps]

625
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,272
[sobs, growls]

626
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:53,990
How many men does it take
to keep one lone female quiet?

627
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:08,754
Colonel, the prisoner
would like a word with you.

628
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,801
Yes, Miss Hunter?

629
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,013
I'm not here to complain
about what you did.

630
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,599
It was your duty as you saw it,
and you did it.

631
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,893
I'm sorry you had to break your word.

632
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:27,189
I gave my word not to run away. I didn't
give it not to cry out for assistance.

633
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,692
I suppose there's a fine point there,

634
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,486
but I have to ask you to give me
your word on that too.

635
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,865
I do that, here and now.

636
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:41,370
Or I suppose when I testify against you,
I'd be handicapped with a broken jaw.

637
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,040
I'd say so. Anything else, ma'am?

638
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,836
One slight item.
My constant companions there.

639
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,214
I don't know how it is up North,
of course, but down South

640
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,676
there are times when Southern women
feel the need for privacy.

641
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:58,971
You two.

642
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,227
We was respectful. Real respectful, sir.

643
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,645
You told us it was all right

644
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,773
just as long as we could see
the top of her head.

645
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,611
- You told them that?
- Well...

646
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,696
Then there's one more item.

647
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:27,625
I suggest you see a doctor.
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

648
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,804
[gunshot]

649
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,558
Over there in that barn. Come on.

650
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,812
[gunshots continue]

651
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:15,464
- We was bushwhacked, Colonel.
- All right, smoke 'em out.

652
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,056
Hold your fire.

653
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:34,066
Hey, there! We're Confederates,
but we ain't hostile.

654
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,571
- Honest!
- Drop your weapons and come on out.

655
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,115
Yes, sir.

656
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,199
Coming.

657
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,753
Hey, Virgil, come ahead on.

658
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,465
They's real bluebellies.

659
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,009
Watch it, Colonel.

660
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:06,056
Just the two of us, Cap.
And one captive.

661
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,946
Howdy, Cap. Jackie Jo and me is sorry
about popping away at you people.

662
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,699
We thought you was more
sheriff deputies coming to get us.

663
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,869
What have you got
against sheriff's deputies?

664
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,247
- That's a good one, huh?
- That's a slick one.

665
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,750
We just love sheriff's deputies.

666
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:38,422
They're deserters from the
Confederacy, sir. The lowest swine bred.

667
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:43,052
- I take it you're the sheriff?
- Captain Henry Goodbody, retired.

668
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,721
Acting sheriff of Lorena County.

669
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,848
I was about to apprehend these rats...

670
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:52,353
But we bushwhacked you,
you old goat, didn't we?

671
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:57,483
[Virgil] That we did, Jackie Jo.
But tell them about us, Captain Goodyo.

672
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,573
- Don't you dare touch him again!
- Miss Hunter.

673
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:10,079
You! You call yourself a man?
Treating with that scum?

674
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,289
Miss Hunter, that man is our enemy.

675
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,335
One word from you of any kind
and he will be shot. Understand?

676
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,586
That's right, ma'am.

677
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,263
Can I help you, miss?

678
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,598
I'm perfectly quite capable
of getting on by myself.

679
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,688
Seems you need
a little attention. Doctor!

680
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,940
Will you look to our good friend's ear?

681
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,193
Sorry but I got a weak stomach.

682
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,696
Otis, see what you can do
for our new recruit.

683
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,910
Hard to explain a man, isn't it?

684
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,459
Take care of this man.

685
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,752
Gunshot wound, sir.

686
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:06,135
Ow! Hey! You aim to stick that thing
clear through to the other side?

687
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:10,306
I seriously doubt it would have met
with any obstruction.

688
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,309
Sergeant, give me a couple
of those good cigars.

689
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,103
Ow! Hey!

690
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:20,316
- Did it hurt you, Virgil?
- This will make you feel better.

691
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,320
We'll have a talk, fellas.
Did you come through Newton Station?

692
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,323
- Sure did.
- Ah. Any troops there?

693
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:31,160
Oh, not no more.
Now, the Alabama Sixth, it was there.

694
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,912
But it moved to Vicksburg
with the Georgia Tenth.

695
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,540
The Tenth was Virg and my's old outfit.

696
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,250
[laughing] "Was" is right.

697
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,587
I guess there aren't any troops
within 30 or 40 miles.

698
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,423
- 60 at least.
- [man] You vile traitors!

699
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,676
Vicksburg, you say?
That's where we're headed for.

700
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,304
Looks like we're in for a little fight.

701
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:55,059
- Thanks, fellas. Untie the sheriff.
- High on the hog, huh, Virg?

702
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:59,938
Hey, looks like you Yankee boys
do all right with the women.

703
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:05,152
[Jackie Jo] And that's a pretty
towheaded one you've got there.

704
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,154
- Hi.
- Howdy, missy.

705
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,991
- Hi, missy.
- See what I told you about up North?

706
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:15,204
- Sergeant, your gauntlets.
- A pleasure, sir.

707
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,168
[Virgil] Hi, missy. Hey, missy.

708
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,462
Remove the prisoner.

709
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:28,217
Are you going to shoot him personal,
Cap? Let Jackie Jo here do it.

710
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,552
He's the best dang shot I ever seen.

711
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,847
I once saw him shoot
a runaway negro slave woman...

712
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,392
right through the... eyes.

713
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,228
[impact]

714
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,189
[Marlowe] Tie 'em up.

715
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:56,161
Sheriff, I'll leave them in your hands.
Pistol. It's loaded.

716
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:02,167
With the compliments
of Miss Hannah Hunter of Greenbriar.

717
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,923
- Thank you, sir.
- [Marlowe] You are welcome, sir.

718
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,552
Satisfied, Miss Hunter?

719
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:16,056
Well, your sense of justice
does surprise me a little.

720
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:20,769
Justice? Those men would
have been excess baggage.

721
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,189
I don't trust them any more
than I really trust...

722
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,859
- Than me?
- That's right.

723
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,701
Yes, ma'am. A hard man to understand.

724
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:12,529
- [man] Hi there, girls!
- [woman] Yankees! Get out of here!

725
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,615
[all shouting]

726
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,996
Get out, you dirty Yankees!
Get out of here!

727
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,617
- Jonathan!
- Miss Hunter. Sorry ma'am.

728
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,037
Mustn't talk to the prisoners.
We've got a nice room for you upstairs.

729
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:06,041
- A nice hot bath for you.
- You can change your clothes.

730
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,043
You see, we've got a lot of work to do.

731
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,630
- You're not going to burn the town?
- No. Just war supplies.

732
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,466
Cotton. Railway equipment.
Contraband, ma'am.

733
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,679
Contraband. That's me, ain't it?

734
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,272
[man] Come on! Dismount!

735
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,779
- Neatly done, Richard.
- Thank you, sir.

736
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,574
- Is this the whole garrison?
- Every last man.

737
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,785
They gave up without a struggle,
like Caesar to Cleopatra.

738
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,955
- [chuckles]
- Without a struggle, huh?

739
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,668
Kirby, set up headquarters
in this hotel.

740
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,421
- It would be a pleasure, sir.
- And close the bar.

741
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:57,092
- Yes, sir.
- Shall we set about the day's work?

742
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:01,305
I'm going to love setting a torch
to this nest of rebels.

743
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,181
[dog barking]

744
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,647
[man] Prisoner!

745
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,193
- Rebel Colonel, sir.
- Yes, sir?

746
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:21,116
What is the contraband in the warehouses
and on those cars in the sidings?

747
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,287
The property of the Confederate States
of America is not contraband, sir.

748
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:26,955
Oh?

749
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,792
Well, let's look at it
from my side, Colonel.

750
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,921
- Jonathan! Jonny Miles.
- You know the Colonel?

751
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:39,092
Sure. We're old friends. Last time
we served together was fighting Indians.

752
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,805
Sorry about the arm.
When did that happen?

753
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,852
I want neither your solicitude
nor to recall our association.

754
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:51,021
Have I your permission to retire, sir?

755
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,900
Take him away.

756
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:08,705
I can't figure a man like Miles
giving up that easy.

757
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,333
He's West Point. Tough as nails.

758
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:14,544
Maybe losing that arm
took a lot out of him.

759
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,131
The man I knew could lose both arms
and still try to kick you to death.

760
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,216
Hoppy?

761
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:25,305
- Did you picket this whole area?
- Yes, sir.

762
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:31,395
Colonel!
There's a reb train coming in, sir.

763
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,815
- Secord! Woodward!
- Yo!

764
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,863
This bar's closed.

765
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,616
[approaching train whistle]

766
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:51,206
Well, it must be a supply train,
rolling right into our laps.

767
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:54,042
I never saw a supply train
without guards on it before.

768
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,504
Well, they wouldn't be too alert
in their own territory.

769
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,924
- Where was that reb Colonel?
- The telegraph office.

770
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,009
- Telegraph office?
- Yes, sir.

771
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,473
All right, Secord, you know what to do.

772
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,226
- Get those horses under cover!
- [all yelling]

773
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:28,994
[man] Get them wagons!

774
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,353
[man] Get that bale off there.
Watch it!

775
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,439
[men continue yelling]

776
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,796
Down, out of sight.

777
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,005
Cover from inside.

778
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,090
[train whistle]

779
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,974
- Sir?
- No, I don't need it.

780
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,271
- Everyone's ready for action, sir.
- Thank you.

781
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,370
[bell clanging]

782
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,548
[gunshot]

783
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,181
[men shouting, cheering]

784
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,992
[gunshots]

785
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,124
[all yelling]

786
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,017
Fire!

787
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,362
I didn't want this.
I tried to avoid a fight.

788
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,239
That's why I took up medicine.

789
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,668
- Look at that idiot!
- Jonny! Jonny Miles!

790
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,752
Cease fire!

791
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,381
[bugle call]

792
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,061
- [Kendall] All right, move him up.
- [man] Move this man up.

793
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,900
Let me be of assistance.
I'm a physician. Dr. Marvin.

794
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,319
Major Kendall. We appreciate your help.

795
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,572
This man is next.

796
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,416
[man groans]

797
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,921
Go get some air.

798
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,758
- I can help.
- Get out.

799
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,602
Get him out of here.

800
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,584
Lou, you go and get some ice.
All you can find.

801
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,294
You too. You help him. Quick.

802
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,018
[steam hissing]

803
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,873
[booming]

804
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,562
How long are you going to be, Kendall?

805
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,897
Take a look for yourself.
We just started.

806
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,943
- I need a definite answer.
- I can't give you one.

807
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,904
I've got a job to do too, you know.

808
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,199
[sighs] At least five hours.

809
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,329
Colonel. Hey, Colonel.

810
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,586
Hello, trooper.

811
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,922
I'm Hoskins. Bud Hoskins.

812
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,340
K Company, sir.

813
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,178
- You don't know me.
- Sure I know you.

814
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,723
Good soldier. You just lie easy, son.

815
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,018
I put my hand on there and it's all...

816
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,521
Just lie still.

817
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,527
You'll write my ma, Colonel?
She'd love it if you...

818
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,989
You'll be writing her yourself
before long.

819
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,408
No.

820
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,911
No, I know.

821
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:11,331
- And I'm scared, Colonel.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

822
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,586
No, I'm all right.

823
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,129
Just hold onto me, sir.

824
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,216
And write my ma.

825
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,636
I'll be in your debt forever.

826
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,238
Aren't you proud?

827
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,951
Yes, I'm very proud of that boy.

828
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,044
- Report.
- Three dead, 18 wounded.

829
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:02,423
Demolition proceeding as ordered, sir.
And the bar is closed.

830
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,259
The bar is open!

831
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,117
- Get some laudanum.
- There is no more, sir.

832
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,211
[shouting]

833
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,633
Come down out of there, buster,
unless you want to go up with it.

834
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:58,313
- [boom]
- [glasses rattle]

835
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,821
Well, John, there goes half a million
dollars of railroad equipment.

836
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:10,575
That's how I made my living, you know.
Building railroads.

837
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:19,459
The railroad's finished for eight miles!
North and south...

838
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,759
John, what are you doing? Wait a minute!

839
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,845
- John!
- Get out!

840
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,556
- You figure this is a hospital?
- Listen to me.

841
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,018
And I can do it to Colonels, too!
Get out of here.

842
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,521
[distant booming]

843
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,939
[glass shatters]

844
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:59,957
When we move out, give your people,
the wounded, a lot of liquor.

845
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,836
I'd do that anyway.

846
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,762
- [glasses clattering]
- [booming continues]

847
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,320
[sobs]

848
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,656
Here, take this.

849
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,991
It will steady you down.

850
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,419
I've never seen it this way before.

851
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,757
I was with my father when he died.

852
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,302
But he died peacefully.

853
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,307
- Without pain.
- Well, it was lucky.

854
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,227
For both of you.

855
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:06,524
- [man groaning loudly]
- Go ahead, Kendall! Have a field day!

856
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,818
What do you mean, field day?

857
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,028
He's fighting to save men's lives.

858
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,449
Men's lives?
Or the reputation of his profession?

859
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,829
- You can't be serious, Colonel Marlowe.
- Have it your way, ma'am.

860
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:27,378
- Medicine is the most noble...
- Sure, noble profession, noble oath.

861
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,797
Lanterns held on high.

862
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,301
So high they won't admit
they're groping for...

863
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:38,431
You're...

864
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,603
- You're unfair and...
- Unfair?

865
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:50,276
There was a girl not much older
than that boy in there.

866
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,321
I wasn't unfair then, understand?

867
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:59,744
Because they used a lot of fancy words
that a section hand wouldn't understand.

868
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,081
So I held her down
while two of 'em worked on her.

869
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,252
I trusted doctors then. Believed in 'em.

870
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,923
Because I was in love
and I didn't want to see her die.

871
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,887
A tumor, they said it was.

872
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,722
And it had to come out right away.

873
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:25,186
So they stuck a leather strap in her
mouth so she could bite off her screams

874
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,022
while they cut away to get in there.

875
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,775
And what did they find? Nothing!

876
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,905
Oh, they were sorry.
Sure, they'd made a mistake.

877
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:39,450
They had something to talk about
before their next experiment.

878
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,788
But what about me?
They left me begging her not to die.

879
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,956
And I lost my wife.

880
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,003
I didn't kill either one of them.

881
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:56,008
I must have been crazy,
or too conventional.

882
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,307
Quite a speech.
I guess I'm feeling my liquor.

883
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:10,439
[men shouting]

884
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,259
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

885
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,344
[bugle call]

886
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,186
Thanks, Hank.

887
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,861
- Well, we almost fooled you.
- Almost.

888
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:02,408
You'll never make it, Hank.
They're already closing in on you.

889
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,369
Bedford Forest
is sniffing at your heels.

890
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:09,498
You're headed straight
for that prison at Andersonville.

891
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,792
There's nothing we can do
to help you there, Hank.

892
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,711
The South is starving.

893
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,007
Jonathan, all I'm doing
is practicing medicine.

894
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:20,009
Old ironhead does all the thinking.

895
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:24,013
He thinks things pretty good.
West Point?

896
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,515
No, section hand.

897
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:32,313
- How are Susan and the kids?
- They're fine.

898
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,483
In Vicksburg.
I expect you'll be seeing them soon.

899
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:40,780
Nice try, Jonathan. Nice try.

900
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,410
See you in Vicksburg, Hoppy.

901
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,046
- Goodbye, Hoppy.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

902
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:01,592
I want to thank you
for all I've learned.

903
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,096
I shall endeavor
to get home alive as many as I can.

904
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,932
You're a good man, Hoppy.

905
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,852
After this thing is all over,
if we don't meet again,

906
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,729
be sure and finish medical school.

907
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,774
I shall make a point of it, sir.

908
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,409
Goodbye, Doctor. And good luck.

909
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,536
Thank you, Doctor, for all your help.

910
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:49,640
Vicksburg. They're headed
southwest to Baton Rouge.

911
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:51,892
Baton Rouge.

912
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,688
It's Baton Rouge, Major.
Tell General Forest.

913
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,913
[Secord] Yes, you can.
I'm on the board of inquiry.

914
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,082
I know exactly what can be done.

915
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,334
Now, he has no right, even as a...

916
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,753
[indistinct whispering]

917
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,343
- [Marlowe] Phil...
- Yes, John?

918
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,764
I'm sorry about what happened
back at Newton Station.

919
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:33,851
Ah, forget it, John.
You were under a strain.

920
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:37,521
But since you brought up the subject...

921
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,107
You know, John,
I'm an older man than you are.

922
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,193
What's more, I'm a politician.

923
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,779
We've knocked over Newton Station.

924
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,865
It's a glorious thing on my...
our records.

925
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:51,911
But now is the time to head north,
back to La Grange...

926
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,413
We're committed, Phil, and that's that.

927
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,626
Stubborn. Stubborn!

928
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,131
Ouch.

929
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,383
Can I have some of that liquor
to swallow, Doc?

930
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,638
You haven't got a good enough excuse.
How'd this happen, Dunker?

931
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:15,768
I was chopping down one of them
telegraph poles back there in Newton.

932
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,813
The axe ricocheted right onto my leg.

933
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:19,980
[men laughing]

934
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,233
- Go arrest the axe.
- It ain't nothing.

935
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:27,905
Nothing, huh? Almost blood poisoning.
You're lucky I saw you limping.

936
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,323
Aw, Doc...

937
01:20:31,284 --> 01:20:33,619
What are you putting on there? Dirt?

938
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:40,125
No. Tree moss. Ordinary green mold.

939
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,379
It has some sort of healing agent,
I imagine.

940
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:47,716
- You imagine?
- I don't imagine the results, Colonel.

941
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,177
This is an old Cheyenne Indian cure.

942
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,933
Cheyenne Indian cure!

943
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,687
Green mold! Tree moss!

944
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:08,404
You keep this on.
Report any soreness to me.

945
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,791
[indistinct commotion]

946
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,043
Lukey!

947
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:11,175
[panting]

948
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:25,272
- What for they shoot me, Miss Hannah?
- It's all right.

949
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:32,655
[Kendall] Get my bag.

950
01:22:55,971 --> 01:23:00,057
- She's gone, ma'am.
- Oh, no.

951
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:02,226
[sobbing]

952
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,824
Are you all right, Miss Hannah?

953
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,411
I brought you
a little bitty piece of candle.

954
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,163
We'll have some hot water
for you in the morning.

955
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:29,086
And lookee here. I found
a piece of looking glass for you.

956
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,265
Thank you.

957
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:00,951
I hope you'll... be able
to get some rest here.

958
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:10,544
You must know how we feel,
ma'am, about Lukey.

959
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,216
How much we regret...

960
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,136
how sorry I am...

961
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,556
that in some way we were the cause of...

962
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,476
Lukey isn't asking for that.

963
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,478
[Marlowe] I wish I could let you go.

964
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,065
If I gave you a horse
and turned you loose,

965
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:36,528
would you promise not to tell anybody
our plans for the next 24 hours?

966
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,155
It's too late.

967
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,617
It's too late for all of that.

968
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,622
No more promises.

969
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,002
No more anything now.

970
01:24:56,174 --> 01:25:01,011
I'm sorry. Truly sorry.

971
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:12,731
Dunker.

972
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,784
- That leg was all right yesterday.
- Yes, but this morning it got swolled.

973
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:27,079
- I had to tear my trouser leg.
- Where's the poultice?

974
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:31,458
It started into itching, sir,
so I just yanked her off.

975
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,961
It was a sign it was
beginning to heal, you fool.

976
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:38,841
Come in here, or you're in trouble.

977
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,343
Brown, lend a hand.

978
01:25:44,055 --> 01:25:45,055
Over there.

979
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,978
- Coffee?
- Thanks.

980
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,148
Report.

981
01:25:56,401 --> 01:26:01,321
That's Salt Springs, all right, sir.
Nary a soldier inside, neither.

982
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,366
Just some old women,
a couple of salt mills

983
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,201
and a school for little boys.

984
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:10,706
- The salt mills will need burning.
- Why show ourselves? We've been lucky.

985
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,749
You call that coffee?

986
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,629
We can't pass 'em up.
Salt is as valuable as ammunition.

987
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:21,008
We'll bivouac here
and hit them in the morning.

988
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:23,093
All right, you're the boss.

989
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:32,394
<i>[Dunker, drunk] ¶ Hi-ho, down we go</i>
<i>There ain't no such word as "can't"...</i>

990
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:37,774
- What's going on?
- The doctor's working on Dunker's leg.

991
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,610
[Dunker continues singing]

992
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:48,327
<i>¶ I left my love</i>
<i>My love I left...</i>

993
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:49,536
Take another pull.

994
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,455
[drunken slurring]

995
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:57,628
Ah, that's good store liquor, Doc.
Who hit John?

996
01:26:57,712 --> 01:27:00,464
- I've got to take it off, Dunker.
- What did you say?

997
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,508
I've got to take your leg off.

998
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,721
You've got to what?

999
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:10,724
The poison's gone too far.
You'll be dead by morning.

1000
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:19,900
What can come of me after that, Doc?
One leg? What can come of me after that?

1001
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:24,488
I'll rig a sling and leave you
with the closest civilian care.

1002
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,365
Civilian care?

1003
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:29,743
Then comes prison next, huh?
Andersonville?

1004
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,871
Is that what happens to me, Doc?!
Andersonville?!

1005
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:36,208
- Quite possibly.
- Yeah.

1006
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:40,170
That's a hell of a tough choice
for a fella to have to make.

1007
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:45,342
- Ain't it? Well, tell me. Ain't it?
- It's got to come off.

1008
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:49,346
All right.

1009
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,724
You just fire away.

1010
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:55,644
But before you start sawing,

1011
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:58,397
you give me some of that
chloroform stuff.

1012
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,358
- You put me out, Doc.
- I'll give you what I got.

1013
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,708
Now bite this.
Give me a hand here. Hold him down.

1014
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,346
[straining] God... God!

1015
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:44,568
It's obviously the column
that raided Newton Station.

1016
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,820
That Vicksburg report was just a faint.

1017
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,365
I thought a brigade of cavalry
was due here to reinforce your battery.

1018
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,992
They won't get here
till late today, sir.

1019
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:55,078
If what you suggest is most extreme.

1020
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,166
- My oldest boy here is only 16.
- Damn it, sir!

1021
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,753
I beg your pardon, Colonel.
I mean, Reverend...

1022
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,673
Look, I've got a boy in my battery
that's 14, a man that's 72.

1023
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,342
This is a war, sir.

1024
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:12,095
I could start lobbing shrapnel and grape
at them critters, catch 'em napping.

1025
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,766
Just a little show of force, sir

1026
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:18,477
then maybe, perhaps we can hold them off
until the cavalry gets here.

1027
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:21,897
- Cadet Major Barksdale.
- Sir?

1028
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:24,066
- Assemble your battalion.
- Every man, sir?

1029
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:28,028
- The entire complement.
- Taylor and Fitcher have the mumps.

1030
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:33,533
Scratch them from the duty roster.
Well, you heard the Lieutenant.

1031
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,453
You'll be pleased to inform the corps
we shall move at dawn.

1032
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,038
[all] Thank you, sir!

1033
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:49,633
[rooster crows]

1034
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,854
[man] Attention!

1035
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:15,283
Cadet Major Barksdale, you may move
your column forward. And God bless you.

1036
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,371
[man] Right shoulder, arms!

1037
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,918
Right, face!

1038
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:31,049
Cadets, forward march!

1039
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:46,082
Reverend, my boy Johnny.
He's all I've got left.

1040
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:51,463
First his pa, then his uncles,
his brothers. Now him?

1041
01:31:51,547 --> 01:31:57,010
He's all I have left, Reverend.
I'm not going to let him go.

1042
01:31:57,094 --> 01:32:00,305
Cadet drummer Buford,
you are relieved of duty.

1043
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,643
[boy screaming]

1044
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:48,270
I'd save a little of that for Dunker.

1045
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,981
I just lost him.

1046
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:56,653
You lost Dunker, eh?

1047
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:00,115
Well, you lost us a good man.

1048
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:03,910
Blood poisoning. Amputation.
A shock to the heart, I guess.

1049
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,704
I wouldn't have had to amputate
if he'd...

1050
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:08,164
If, maybe, perhaps.

1051
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:11,835
- What's the matter, medicine man?
- Section hand, I've had you!

1052
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,503
Strip your blouse!

1053
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,765
I think you're right. Come on.

1054
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:29,644
Orderly! Horses! Bring 'em up!

1055
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:42,991
Johnny!

1056
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,077
Johnny Buford!

1057
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:48,413
Johnny!

1058
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:11,269
- What are the rules, Colonel?
- Just make up your own.

1059
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:20,236
You said no rules, Colonel.

1060
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,326
On your feet, croaker.

1061
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,583
Fire Peter!

1062
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,714
[shouting]

1063
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,596
Fire Paul!

1064
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:01,444
Fire Paul!

1065
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:10,495
Artillery fire, sir. Hidden battery.

1066
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:27,220
Those are nothing but children.
They're schoolboys.

1067
01:35:27,304 --> 01:35:30,682
Just some kids
from the military school.

1068
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,100
Yeah, but they keep coming.

1069
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,652
Sound assembly.

1070
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:02,464
Well, at least that
Holy Joe ain't no kid.

1071
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,980
[man shouting orders]

1072
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:28,364
[man] Halt! Front rank, kneel!

1073
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,576
- Ready!
- Miss Hunter...

1074
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:34,704
[man] Aim! Fire!

1075
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,631
[man] Rear rank, halt!

1076
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,050
Kneel!

1077
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:51,387
- Ready! Aim! Fire!
- [shrieks]

1078
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,938
What do you want to do?
Set up a field hospital?

1079
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,981
Yes, Mr. Colonel Marlowe,
what are you going to do now?

1080
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,150
With all due respect
to your presence, ma'am,

1081
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,319
I'm going to get
the hell out of here. Bugler!

1082
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:07,904
Sound recall!

1083
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,410
I told you to take care of this woman!

1084
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:16,955
[explosion]

1085
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:22,001
Hey Colonel, I got me a prisoner.
What do you want me to do with him?

1086
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:25,213
- Spank him.
- On the bottom?

1087
01:37:25,297 --> 01:37:26,714
Where do you think?

1088
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,510
[boy shouting]

1089
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,931
[men cheering]

1090
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,884
- [man] Halt!
- Hold it, Colonel.

1091
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,969
[men shouting]

1092
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:22,395
- Report.
- Rebs. They got the whole road blocked.

1093
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,315
- How many?
- A full regiment of regulars, sir.

1094
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:28,776
They got two pieces of artillery
and they're digging in along the road.

1095
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:38,912
The only thing to do is fight our way
back to Salt Springs and head east.

1096
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:43,833
- Haven't you seen that dust?
- Cavalry. Following us for three hours.

1097
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:50,131
Colonel, the deacon says he knows this
country real good. Don't you, Deacon?

1098
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:51,591
Preaching the gospel,

1099
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:55,053
singing the praises of the Lord
hereabouts for years.

1100
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,889
It might be a good idea
to start praying right now.

1101
01:38:57,973 --> 01:39:02,477
The deacon smuggled runaway slaves
north out of here through the swamp.

1102
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:08,441
- With the underground railway.
- Could you smuggle us out south?

1103
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:11,194
Wait a minute John. Wait a minute.

1104
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,821
Why, that swamp is full
of quicksand, cotton mouth, rattlers...

1105
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:17,200
The Garden of Eden
had its sufferance too.

1106
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:20,286
Follow me, brother Colonel,
through the swamps

1107
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:25,875
all the way to the river Amite.
Lead kindly, Lord.

1108
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,336
All right, get yourself
a couple of fresh horses.

1109
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:34,425
By the right flank, take cover.

1110
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:55,196
Come on!

1111
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,188
[horse whinnies]

1112
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,066
[Marlowe] Come on! Come on! Come on!

1113
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,238
[man] Move out. Come on, boy.

1114
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:23,534
Come on, boy.

1115
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:27,580
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on!

1116
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:34,545
Keep moving. Stay awake there, kid.

1117
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,799
Keep moving. Pick up your feet.

1118
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:41,552
John, how far do you figure
to Baton Rouge?

1119
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,221
40 miles.

1120
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,056
Keep alive in there!

1121
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:48,601
- You want me to apologize now or later?
- For what?

1122
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:52,063
- Keep moving!
- I never thought you could do it.

1123
01:41:52,147 --> 01:41:57,026
You know, John, I've given up
all thought of running for Congress.

1124
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,488
With this on my record,
by George, I can be Governor.

1125
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:02,657
- Keep moving!
- Governor of Michigan.

1126
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:05,201
- Stay alive!
- And you can name your own job.

1127
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:06,285
Railroad commissioner...

1128
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:10,164
I wouldn't start making
campaign promises till we get there.

1129
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,457
Join your regiment.

1130
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,586
Colonel, my duty, medically speaking,
is to inform you that

1131
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:18,464
some of these men may make it
on their hands and knees.

1132
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:21,884
We've been 20 hours without a stop.
We need a rest.

1133
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,845
I've got eyes, Kendall.

1134
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:27,306
It's also my duty to inform you
that if we run into a fight...

1135
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,101
That is all, Doctor.

1136
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,978
Thank you, sir.

1137
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:05,928
- Column, halt!
- Column, halt!

1138
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:13,311
- Woodward.
- [man] Yo!

1139
01:43:14,646 --> 01:43:17,273
First squad,
scout the other side of the bridge.

1140
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:20,818
First squad, forward, yo!

1141
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:26,616
[hooves clatter on bridge]

1142
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,216
I don't know if you've heard.

1143
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,720
Your people are about an hour
behind us, coming fast.

1144
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:49,096
I've heard.

1145
01:43:50,807 --> 01:43:55,228
We're going on to Baton Rouge.
We'll leave you here.

1146
01:43:56,855 --> 01:43:58,940
Your own kind can take care of you.

1147
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:02,985
- I'm sure they can.
- Yes.

1148
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:07,531
I...

1149
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:14,080
I'm sorry for the hardship and...

1150
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:18,292
the humiliation that we've...

1151
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:20,378
that I've caused you.

1152
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:22,880
[gunfire]

1153
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,516
Get her out of here!

- [man] Recall!

01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:46,237
Get her in that cabin!

1157
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:55,496
Come on, Miss Hannah.

1158
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:09,385
Looks like they've got us in a trap.

1159
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,681
[gunfire continues]

1160
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:15,975
Knock on it!

1161
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,318
Give us some cover!

1162
01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:38,456
Captain Woodward, move!

1163
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:52,053
Leave me alone.

1164
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:56,057
I'm all right. Let me alone, would you?

1165
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:05,983
[gunfire continues]

1166
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,361
Easy.

1167
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:12,782
Get Colonel Secord right away.
Not that way, the other door.

1168
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,034
- Report.
- It's alive with rebs, sir.

1169
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:17,203
And I seen at least two cannons.

1170
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:20,289
- They jumped us so quick.
- Infantry?

1171
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,874
- The wood's full of 'em.
- Join your troop.

1172
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:23,334
Yes sir.

1173
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:26,045
- Cut his boot off, Sam.
- Nobody's cutting that boot off.

1174
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:27,713
- I got a lot of work to do.
- Cut his boot off.

1175
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:34,637
Take a good stiff jolt.

1176
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:40,601
Those are $20 boots, trooper.

1177
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,858
- Get some water.
- Who, me?

1178
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:58,452
Take A-troop and that reverend,
or whatever he is.

1179
01:46:58,995 --> 01:47:03,791
Find a ford someway across that river.
Flank 'em. Take a bugler with you.

1180
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:07,461
Yes sir. Thank you for the opportunity.

1181
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:54,717
John, we've ridden right into a trap.
They want us to cross that bridge.

1182
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:57,136
It'd be like going through a funnel.

1183
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,805
We've accomplished our purpose, John.

1184
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:04,268
In a position like this, there's nothing
disgraceful about honorable surrender.

1185
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:08,272
Get back to your troop.
Keep 'em under cover.

1186
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:12,818
- You mean... you're going on?
- Get out of here!

1187
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:16,572
You're not going far
with that bullet in you.

1188
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:21,827
You're taking your own sweet time
about cutting it out of there.

1189
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,663
You're not the only wounded man
here, Colonel. Get me my bag.

1190
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,958
Now, this is going to hurt a little.

1191
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,129
Go on with it, Kendall.

1192
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:35,758
- [grunts in pain]
- Keep that leg stretched.

1193
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:39,762
Probe, please.

1194
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:04,620
[Marlowe grunts]

1195
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:10,292
Are you having fun?

1196
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:19,301
You're lucky.

1197
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:29,812
You may not believe it, Colonel,
but I bought you some time.

1198
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:35,985
- A couple of hours?
- Maybe more.

1199
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:38,112
Thanks.

1200
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:54,003
- First Michigan in position, sir.
- First Illinois in position.

1201
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:56,005
We were in position first.

1202
01:49:58,216 --> 01:49:59,216
I'm all right.

1203
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:09,893
Get cracking.

1204
01:50:33,376 --> 01:50:36,337
God Almighty. Here he comes.

1205
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:41,717
Mount up.

1206
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:46,013
You heard me, Kirby. Mount up.

1207
01:50:46,097 --> 01:50:49,224
- You heard the Colonel! Mount up!
- [men shouting]

1208
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:08,619
Colonel.

1209
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:13,666
The deacon found a place to ford.
The men ought to be in position by now.

1210
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:19,046
Thanks. Cover our rear.
See how much time we've got.

1211
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:20,130
Yes, sir.

1212
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:38,649
- Where's your horse?
- Back in the swamp, sir.

1213
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:45,072
- Lips dry?
- Yes, sir. But my bugle ain't.

1214
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:52,621
- Uncase the colors.
- You heard him.

1215
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:05,843
You know your orders?

1216
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:09,012
John, You're not fit.
Let me lead this charge.

1217
01:52:09,097 --> 01:52:12,725
With a success like this,
I could land in the White House.

1218
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,643
- [bugle call]
- We'll probably all land in the...

1219
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,645
[gunfire]

1220
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,021
Get back to your regiment!

1221
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:21,567
Bugler, sound charge!

1222
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:39,042
[shouting]

1223
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:45,424
Forwards! Fire Paul.

1224
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:56,602
Company!

1225
01:54:04,754 --> 01:54:06,755
You're hurt, sir.

1226
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,591
Blow... Trumpet, blow.

1227
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:30,404
They can't give up.

1228
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:35,033
Maybe it's crazy, maybe it's brave.
Don't ask me to explain it. Nobody can.

1229
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,536
Come on, we're going to have
a lot of work to do.

1230
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:49,756
Bugler, sound recall.

1231
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,686
- [man] Got any more?
- [indistinct chatter]

1232
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,108
[man] Come on, give us some more.

1233
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:19,244
How much longer, Sergeant?
Sergeant Major.

1234
01:55:19,329 --> 01:55:20,537
Pretty near ready, sir.

1235
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:23,290
All right, boys! Hurry it up! Lay it in!

1236
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:25,042
Knock on it! Knock on it!

1237
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:39,890
Come on out! Get out of there!

1238
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:46,772
- Can those men be moved?
- They're all critical.

1239
01:55:46,856 --> 01:55:49,441
- May I speak to them?
- I'd rather you didn't.

1240
01:55:49,525 --> 01:55:51,735
They've got to be quiet.
I've given them all the laudanum I have.

1241
01:55:52,737 --> 01:55:55,530
It's a lousy finish for good men.

1242
01:55:57,033 --> 01:56:00,077
There'll be a medic with that
reb column. Get your horse.

1243
01:56:00,161 --> 01:56:02,162
I can't count on that.

1244
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,123
You mean you're staying?

1245
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:08,627
- Medicine's where you find it.
- Even in Andersonville?

1246
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:10,504
Even in Andersonville.

1247
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:17,302
I wouldn't blame you
if you slap it away. Shake hands?

1248
01:56:19,013 --> 01:56:23,266
- Doctor, Major Gray.
- All right, coming.

1249
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:25,727
When your next doctor
takes that bandage off...

1250
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,813
Yeah, I know. Tree moss.

1251
01:56:28,272 --> 01:56:29,731
So long, croaker.

1252
01:56:30,858 --> 01:56:32,401
Take care, section hand.

1253
01:56:58,886 --> 01:57:02,931
You're tired. You've helped a lot.
Thanks for it.

1254
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:09,104
A poor way of being grateful
after what I've put you through.

1255
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:15,277
- You'd better be going.
- Yes, I guess I'd better.

1256
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:19,364
Look, Hannah Hunter.

1257
01:57:21,242 --> 01:57:25,162
Thank God I won't be the cause
of hurting you any more.

1258
01:57:25,246 --> 01:57:28,123
Because it happens I'm in love with you.

1259
01:57:30,626 --> 01:57:32,878
- [distant bugle call]
- [distant shouting]

1260
01:57:32,962 --> 01:57:35,005
Tell her the rest when you get back.

1261
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:12,209
- One of your own, sir.
- Get going.

1262
01:58:12,293 --> 01:58:14,002
Colonel, they're right on my tail.

1263
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,533
[Marlowe] Let's go. Yah!

1264
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:22,070
Doctor, could our regimental surgeon
be of any service to you?

1265
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:23,738
I'd be grateful.
