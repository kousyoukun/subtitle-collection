General Hurlburt, by appointment.

- General Sherman, Colonel Marlowe.
- How do you do?

00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,759
Marlowe, I've been anxious to meet you.

- It's a privilege, sir.
- Sit down.

40
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,560
- Is this your first look at Vicksburg?
- Yes, sir.

41
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,148
We've been looking at it
for ten months, and we don't like it.

42
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,528
Colonel, for your benefit,
the war on our side

43
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,030
hasn't been going well at all.

Not in Washington,
not in the newspapers, not in the field.

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,623
To put it mildly,
with less men and less resources,

46
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,083
the South has whipped us
to a standstill.

[distant cannon fire]

48
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,714
Now, if I could take Vicksburg...

49
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,680
...the whole picture would change,
but I'd have to do it this summer.

50
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,682
Or sit out here another year.

51
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,978
Which might cost us 100,000 men.
It might cost us a war.

52
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,191
Which brings all this talk down to
their main source of supply...

53
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,401
...and a thorn in our side.

54
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,529
- Newton Station.
- Sam.

55
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,658
Marlowe has worked out the details
of your plan pretty thoroughly.

56
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,825
Let's hear them.

57
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:08,830
If I could get back to La Grange
right away, we could leave by Thursday.

58
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,166
Good. Who would your people be?

59
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:16,338
My own First Illinois with Secord's
First Michigan and Second Iowa.

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,840
We'd be culled down to a short brigade.

61
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,261
Cross at La Grange, down through Ripley,
New Albany, Houston...

62
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,267
- Is there something wrong, sir?
- I know the map, Colonel. Proceed.

63
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,772
Anyway, the main trick is
no fighting until we hit Newton Station.

64
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,983
How much track do you figure to destroy?

65
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,943
As much as I can get my hands on.

66
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,405
At least enough to keep them busy for
a couple of months rebuilding.

67
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,616
Otherwise, the raid would
just be another horse ride.

68
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,995
All right, Colonel, go ahead.

69
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,664
All the rails, ties, buildings, bridges,

all the rolling stock
you can get your hands on.

71
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,961
Sam, even if he should manage
to get through to Newton Station,

72
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,047
he'd be 300 miles dead center
in the Confederacy.

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,303
- Have you thought how you'd get back?
- Have you, sir?

74
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,431
Well, I guess I asked for that.

75
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,976
But I hate to think of you sitting it
out in Andersonville Prison.

76
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,187
- It's a hellhole.
- I'd think about that twice, too, sir.

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,400
Well, Colonel, your success.

All right, here is La Grange.

80
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,760
- We will make 35 miles a day, average.
- 35?

81
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:50,140
- 35? Isn't that stretching it a bit?
- It will be the first day, Ned.

82
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,685
I intend to make twice that distance.
In an operation like this,

83
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,604
everything is stretched.
Even our necks...

from five days to three...

the land eventually.

while they're fresh.

headed for Nashville in a parade.

That was a good rumor to spread,
with the help of the Sergeant Major.

they had me fooled too. [chuckles]

at Andersonville, Phil.

Where are your side arms, Kendall?

If you look in the book, you'll see
a surgeon doesn't carry them.

Surgeon? You cut out our artillery and
our wagons. Nothing to slow us down.

And now you saddle us
with a doctor and a medical unit?

about my going along.

I hadn't counted on you, that's all.

141

I can understand your reasons
for trying to avoid a fight,

142
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,783

very deep into enemy territory.

Tell me, what did you intend to do
about your wounded?

Naturally.

That's a pretty primitive attitude.
Medically speaking.

Well, Doctor,
war isn't exactly a civilized business.

Of course, I realize that it gives you

[dogs barking]

306
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,186
Lukey, what are the dogs
raising such a fuss about?

307
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,189
Dogs? You know how dogs
make such a fuss.

308
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:18,873
- Soldiers, Miss Hannah. Lots of 'em.
- Soldiers? How wonderful!

309
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,311
Thunder in the outhouse.
Them's Yankees.

310
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,481
Lukey, you go on downstairs
and meet them.

311
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,982
Lukey, do you hear?

312
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,238
[knocking]

313
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,241
[dog whining]

314
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,007
Come here, girl.

315
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,635
Come on.

316
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:19,558
- Who lives here?
- Miss Hannah Hunter lives here.

317
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,479
Tell her I want to see her.
Colonel Marlowe, Union Army.

318
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,730
Yes, sir.

319
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,275
Put that gun away.

320
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,804
- Sorry for this intrusion, ma'am.
- It isn't that, Colonel.

321
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:01,141
It's just that I never prepared myself
to see that uniform

322
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,143
within the walls of this house.

323
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:07,189
Ma'am, we no more wish to be here
than you do to have us.

324
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,401
Why, that's gallantly spoken, Colonel.

325
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,404
No matter what our...
well, our differences,

326
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,990
I fear I'm forgetting the amenities.

327
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,284
- Welcome to Greenbriar, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

328
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,246
Lukey, take the gentlemen's hats.

329
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,877
Uh...

330
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,172
- Sergeant Kirby.
- Sergeant.

331
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,882
Ma'am.

332
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:39,263
Well, shall we make ourselves
more comfortable in the Rose Room?

333
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,600
No, thank you, ma'am.
We'll only stay a moment.

334
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,144
You and your men are riding on?

335
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,814
No, we will bivouac
in your woods for the night.

336
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,775
Sleeping on the cold, cold ground?

337
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,947
When is this awful, wasteful,
terrible struggle going to end, Colonel?

338
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,282
Why, brother against brother...

339
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:03,829
And during our stay no one will
be allowed to leave the premises.

340
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,540
And wherever would we go, Colonel?

341
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,211
I'm sure you must agree that this war
makes loneliness for everyone.

342
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,049
Also, I must commandeer most
of the grain and horses,

343
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,216
if you have any.

344
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:21,388
You will be paid, Miss Hunter,
for everything, in Union greenbacks.

345
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,391
We will not bother you
any longer. Good evening.

346
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,686
- Kirby.
- By your leave, ma'am.

347
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:31,523
Why Hannah Hunter, what's got hold
of you, talking like a field hand?

348
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,860
- You alls, we alls.
- Yankees! [sighs]

349
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,614
[spits]

350
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,951
It's uncanny, Colonel.

351
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,664
I've heard about 'em,
but I didn't believe it.

352
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,666
I'll have you know,
I received my commission

353
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,959
from the Governor from
the sovereign state of Michigan!

354
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,629
- Young man...
- What's your question?

355
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:58,008
The question is this man's authority
in his present position.

356
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,720
As usual, I am trying to present
the grim facts of life.

357
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,473
Colonel Secord doesn't understand
that coffee tastes better

358
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,851
if the latrines are dug
downstream instead of upstream.

359
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,522
- How do you like your coffee, Colonel?
- [laughing]

360
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,857
- Ah, Secord, you oughta...
- Pardon.

361
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,819
Oh, Colonel! Colonel Marlowe!

362
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,493
I am forgetting my manners.
Why, how I ever...

363
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,164
Well, I don't believe
I've met these gentlemen.

364
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:35,379
Miss Hunter. Colonel Secord.
Major Gray. Major Kendall.

365
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,463
Ma'am.

366
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,008
[giggles] I'm just so scatterbrained.

367
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:44,012
Poor Papa and Mama must be
turning over in their graves at me

368
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:48,809
for not extending what little
hospitality Greenbriar can offer.

369
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,396
At least I can extend an invitation
to you and your officers for dinner.

370
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,566
- No, Miss Hunter...
- I insist.

371
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,068
There's three fat capons
that have to go anyhow.

372
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:03,699
What with our store of grain
being reduced, like you mentioned.

373
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,202
So, you see, you brought it
on yourself, didn't you?

374
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,289
Speaking for myself,
I would be delighted...

375
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:14,668
Very well, thank you.
Hot food is pretty hard to turn down.

376
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,504
Splendid. Now, how many can I count on?

377
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,257
- Would five or six be...?
- Not at all.

378
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,634
Perfectly wonderful.

379
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,511
At nine, gentlemen?

380
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,097
- Colonel Secord?
- Of the First Michigan, ma'am.

381
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,475
- Major Gray?
- Ma'am.

382
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,894
Major... Kendall, isn't it?

383
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,149
I'm afraid I'll have to regret, ma'am.
It's not of my choice, I assure you.

384
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,777
At the moment, I'm under arrest.

385
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,363
We will all be glad to accept
the invitation, Miss Hunter.

386
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,839
Ma'am?

387
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,425
You dropped your handkerchief.

388
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,638
Care for a little more,
Colonel Secord?

389
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:12,601
- No, thank you, ma'am.
- Colonel Marlowe?

390
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,562
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come now, Colonel.

391
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,066
A man with a big frame like yours
can’t just nibble away

392
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,652
like a little old titmouse.

393
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,822
Gentlemen, please be seated.

394
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:30,661
Now, what was your preference?
The leg... or the breast?

395
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,835
I've had quite enough of both,
thank you.

396
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,504
Oh... What a shame.

397
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,011
- Would anyone else like some more?
- [all] No, thank you.

398
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:53,851
Gentlemen, be seated.
I must warn you too, there's no coffee.

399
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,437
And a sweet or a dessert of any kind
was just out of the question.

400
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,524
Sugar's $150 a barrel.

401
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,612
"And yet your fair discourse
hath been as sweet as sugar,

402
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,157
making the hard way
sweet and delectable."

403
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,659
[men cheer]

404
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,371
How perfectly charming.
A little something of your own?

405
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,456
No, ma'am. Richard II.

406
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,670
- By profession, I'm an actor.
- Why, how fascinating!

407
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:25,674
Why, Major Ken... [gasps] Your cigar.
Gentlemen, please be seated.

408
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,844
[sighs]

409
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:35,392
Major Kendall a doctor. And
Colonel Secord almost a congressman.

410
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,605
And you an actor.
And now all military men.

411
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,441
Such a waste of talent.

412
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,026
But, of course, Colonel Marlowe,

413
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,821
I imagine that you are
a professional soldier.

414
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,742
No, prior to this insanity,
I was a railroad engineer.

415
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,453
Why, how thrilling.

416
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:59,833
To think of being able to steer one of
those huge things, puffing and steaming.

417
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,503
Ringing that little bell.
Ding-dong! Ding-dong!

418
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,841
Not quite. My job was
in the construction of railroads.

419
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,929
Why, my! Such brilliant minds.

420
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:17,100
Poor little me barely squeezed through
Miss Longstreet's Seminary for Ladies.

421
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,980
How did you ever manage
to remember all those books in college?

422
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,440
I didn't.

423
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:27,945
I started driving rail spikes
at ten cents a day and found.

424
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,572
And now, Miss Hunter,
I must ask you to leave us.

425
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:35,744
We are taking the privilege of using
this room for an hour or two. If we may.

426
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:40,499
Of course, but wouldn't you prefer
using another room? The study, perhaps?

427
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,044
- We're quite comfortable here.
- [men chatter in agreement]

428
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,089
I'm sorry,
but I must be rude and explain.

429
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:51,969
You see, Lukey and I must be in the
fields by five in the morning.

430
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,595
Gentlemen, go ahead
and light your cigars.

431
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,472
- [all] Thank you, ma'am.
- And you see, all this...

432
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,141
- Allow me.
- Thank you kindly.

433
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,144
All this and the dishes must be done
before she can get to bed.

434
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:05,315
- Am I being too inconsiderate?
- Of course not, ma'am.

435
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,610
- May I?
- Of course. This way, gentlemen.

436
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,904
- [all chattering]
- [man] How wonderful.

437
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,241
[man] Really, I thought it was a
charming dinner.

438
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,333
- Post this room.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,878
- I hope you'll be comfortable here.
- Oh, yes. This is fine.

440
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,092
Now, if you wish to light a fire,
it's all ready.

441
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,301
No, it's fine.

442
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:38,598
- Some brandy. I'll have Lukey bring it.
- No, thank you, no brandy.

443
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,518
Are you sure there's
nothing more that I can...

444
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,270
Oh, yes. Uh...

445
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,023
Doctor, there's no need
for you to be a part of this.

446
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:50,110
Perhaps Miss Hunter would show you
some of the beauties of Greenbriar.

447
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,697
Why, of course,
if he has any interest...

448
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,949
He'd be pleased to.

449
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,785
Very well. Come, then, Doctor.

450
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,708
I noticed a lovely garden outside.
Shall we take a stroll?

451
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,377
Why, of course.

452
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,173
You know, you gentlemen must be
comfortable in your heavy uniforms,

453
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:16,053
but I feel a definite chill in the
air... it's me and my thin blood.

454
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,555
Would you excuse me
while I go and fetch a shawl?

455
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,475
- Miss Hunter.
- Yes, Major?

456
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,353
I'm afraid I'll have to go with you.

457
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,898
Upstairs? With me?

458
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,275
- Why, Major!
- You're only getting a shawl.

459
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,528
Of course,
but in these parts it's unheard of...

460
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,364
It's something spicy
to tell your grandchildren.

461
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,327
This is war. At the moment,
Greenbriar is a military installation.

462
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:45,290
I don't suppose there's any real harm,
being that you're a doctor.

463
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,374
That's right.

464
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,009
Lukey, bring some brandy
to my sitting room, please.

465
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,351
I hope you'll be
comfortable here, Major.

466
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,727
Thank you.

467
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,579
Thank you.

468
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,091
Hey! Where are you going with that?

469
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:40,011
- Miss Hannah asked for this brandy.
- Yeah, yeah, I know, for the Major.

470
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:44,850
We never give any of our top-ranking
officers an unlabeled bottle,

471
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,852
unless somebody tastes it first.

472
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,814
- Is this what you does? Test things?
- Certainly.

473
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:55,569
See that second stripe? That means
I'm official taster for majors on up.

474
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,824
- Here's La Grange.
- [man] Mm-hm.

475
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:06,121
We've come down here
approximately 80 miles.

476
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,832
We're headed for Newton Station.

477
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,835
[Gray] Any word on
the enemy strength there?

478
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:16,339
No, not a word. Whatever it is,
we're obliged to take it on.

479
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,343
- Good. Maybe we'll see action.
- This is not play-acting.

480
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,142
- Here's your brandy, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

481
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:31,521
- And it's all tested.
- Tested?

482
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,065
By the man downstairs with
those tester's stripes,

483
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,859
for majors on up.

484
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,112
Oh, yes. Sergeant Kirby.

485
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,283
- He really tested it, didn't he?
- Yes, sir. Twice.

486
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,535
- [Hannah] Lukey?
- Yes, Miss Hannah.

487
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,456
Excuse me, sir.

488
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,509
[Marlowe] ...very lucky.

489
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,519
[men chattering in study]

490
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:19,527
That is the next piece of information.
We're not going back to La Grange.

491
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,573
- We're what?
- We're not going back north.

492
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:29,663
We're heading south to Baton Rouge
to join up with the Union forces there.

493
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,709
- Great Scott, when did you decide that?
- It's the best way. It's the only way.

494
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:41,925
John, it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to Baton Rouge.

495
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,096
And it is 300 miles
from Newton Station to La Grange.

496
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,474
Only the rebs will really have been
closed in behind us,

497
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,643
ready to chew us to bits.

498
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,938
So we'll go out the way
they least expect: straight south.

499
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,648
Damn it John, it's suicide.

500
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:00,485
Why we couldn't... Is it possible your
orders could have been misinterpreted?

501
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,779
My only duty after Newton Station

502
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,032
is to get as many of these men
back alive as I can.

503
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,455
[Secord] And so I still must protest.

504
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,792
And what's more, I want that
on the record for General Hurlburt.

505
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,003
It is impetuous mass suicide.

506
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,089
[Marlowe] It's on the record,
but get this.

507
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,717
Unless enemy action
allows you to take my place,

508
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,510
that's the way it will be.

509
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,139
Blow Newton Station off the map,
then through to Baton Rouge.

510
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,766
There will be no change.
Do you understand?

511
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,352
[Secord] All right, you're in command.

512
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:38,690
[Marlowe] Now let's go over it again.
Straight through to Baton Rouge.

513
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,233
We will not turn back.

514
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,282
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Was the brandy satisfactory?

515
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,826
- Excellent. Won't you join me?
- Goodness me, no.

516
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,953
I never touch spirits.

517
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:56,583
My papa taught me that a girl ought
to keep her wits about her at all times.

518
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,877
Your father raised a very smart girl.

519
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,838
You're just being sweet.
Would you like to see the garden?

520
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,340
Didn't you forget your shawl?

521
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,052
Why, Lukey!

522
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,561
Now, Lukey, you take
that tray downstairs

523
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,646
and go about doing what you have to do.

524
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,276
You know, I remember the first time
I tried spirits,

525
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,362
at the Governor's Ball in Jackson.

526
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:30,992
My escort, Adam Lovelace from Biloxi,
well, he gave me a mint julep.

527
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,871
You know, those Lovelace boys
are all very handsome, but fast,

528
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,414
if you know what I mean.

529
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,584
Well, if I could tell you the thoughts
that went on in my mind

530
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:42,379
after that one julep... My!

531
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,006
I'd rather know the thoughts
going on in your mind right now.

532
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,222
- Kendall, what in the name of...?
- Ah-ah-ah. Sorry we have to interrupt.

533
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,724
Maybe we out to ask them
what they think your chances are

534
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,685
of blowing up Newton Station
and getting to Baton Rouge.

535
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,605
- Are you drunk?
- Unfortunately, no.

536
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,400
They were listening upstairs.

537
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,448
Makes a pretty good stethoscope.

538
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,120
Don't feel too guilty.
I was slower to catch on than you.

539
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,205
Where were you, Kendall?

540
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,417
Well, a gentlemen thinks twice
before peeking into a lady's bedroom,

541
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,627
but sometimes it pays off.

542
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,548
Looks like she's made
a fool out of both of us.

543
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,925
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

544
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,052
[sighs]

545
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,847
You know something, Miss Hunter?

546
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,182
You have put me
to quite an inconvenience.

547
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,768
At least I've
accomplished something, sir.

548
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,521
I don't suppose I could accept
your word of honor

549
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,982
not to discuss this with anyone else.

550
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,984
I don't hold to honor
with any Yankees.

551
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,318
Exactly.

552
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,363
So the whole state of Mississippi
will be alerted.

553
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,575
So could you possibly suggest
what I should do with you?

554
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,370
I noticed she was getting on your
nerves. Now's your chance to shoot her.

555
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,541
- One more word out of you...
- Go ahead. Shoot us.

556
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:06,087
Shoot both of us. But you'll never
get away with the rest of your filthy,

557
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,466
murdering plans, Mr. Colonel Marlowe.

558
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,470
You Yankees and your holy principle
about saving the Union.

559
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,015
You're plundering pirates, that's what.

560
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,685
You think there's no Confederate army
where you're going?

561
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:24,814
Do you think our boys
are asleep down here?

562
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,358
They'll catch up to you
and they'll cut you to pieces,

563
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,279
you nameless, fatherless scum!

564
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,575
[sobs] And I wish I could be there
to see it.

565
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,287
If it happens, Miss Hunter, you will be.

566
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,765
- [man] Hurry it up.
- [man 2] All right.

567
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,304
You're an excellent rider, Miss Hunter.

568
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,475
Right interesting country, isn't it?

569
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,315
I'm more interested in why you vandals
confiscated my dead father's clothes.

570
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,525
Well, they're for our cadets.

571
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,945
- Scouts.
- Scouts!

572
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,989
Spies, you mean.

573
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:42,368
It's a wonder they don't crawl along
on their bellies like snakes.

574
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,122
You'll find out what happens
to spies down here.

575
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:50,043
My personal experience with spies
is limited. I've only known one.

576
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,713
Do you mind, Major?
I prefer to ride alone.

577
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,257
Ma'am.

578
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,265
Miss Hannah!

579
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,155
All right, forward! Yo-oh!

580
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,243
Back in line, Doctor.

581
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,335
[Hannah screams]

582
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:56,693
Well.

583
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,905
- These lady's drawers are almost dry.
- Yeah.

584
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,118
Aren't you getting a little chilly?

585
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,370
Don't tell me you're concerned
about my health.

586
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,957
If I give you back your clothes,
will you promise not to run away again?

587
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:17,714
I would, ma'am. There's a point
where pride becomes impractical.

588
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,633
Actually, if you could get a look
at yourself, I'd think you'd agree.

589
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,848
Very well. I do wish to keep my health.

590
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,934
- I shall not try to run away again.
- Your word of honor?

591
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,188
- My word of honor.
- To Yankees?

592
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,776
- To Yankees.
- Cross your heart?

593
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,945
- I gave you my word!
- All right, Lukey.

594
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,739
Help Miss Hunter with her clothes.

595
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,035
I'm glad you're being sensible.
You were beginning to worry me.

596
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,914
- From a medical standpoint.
- Thank you, Doctor.

597
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,875
I wish I could be of further assistance,

598
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,129
but fortunately you Southern people
have your own help.

599
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,068
[Kirby] Attention! Eyes front!

600
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,539
[man] Rebs, sir!

601
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,627
Hopping that riverbank.
A full brigade, coming fast.

602
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,173
Horse, foot and artillery, sir.
It ain't militia, neither.

603
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,258
- How far?
- Ten minutes.

604
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,093
All right, get out of sight,
get in those trees.

605
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:56,312
Enemy patrol. Take cover and choke up.

606
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:00,066
- Bugler!

01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:14,544
Maybe losing that arm
took a lot out of him.

760
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,131
The man I knew could lose both arms
and still try to kick you to death.

761
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,216
Hoppy?

762
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:25,305
- Did you picket this whole area?
- Yes, sir.

763
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:31,395
Colonel!
There's a reb train coming in, sir.

764
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,815
- Secord! Woodward!
- Yo!

765
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,863
This bar's closed.

766
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,616
[approaching train whistle]

767
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:51,206
Well, it must be a supply train,
rolling right into our laps.

768
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:54,042
I never saw a supply train
without guards on it before.

769
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,504
Well, they wouldn't be too alert
in their own territory.

770
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,924
- Where was that reb Colonel?
- The telegraph office.

771
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,009
- Telegraph office?
- Yes, sir.

772
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,473
All right, Secord, you know what to do.

773
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,226
- Get those horses under cover!
- [all yelling]

774
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:28,994
[man] Get them wagons!

775
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,353
[man] Get that bale off there.
Watch it!

776
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,439
[men continue yelling]

777
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,796
Down, out of sight.

778
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,005
Cover from inside.

779
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,090
[train whistle]

780
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,974
- Sir?
- No, I don't need it.

781
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,271
- Everyone's ready for action, sir.
- Thank you.

782
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,370
[bell clanging]

783
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,548
[gunshot]

784
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,181
[men shouting, cheering]

01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,992
[gunshots]

786
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,124
[all yelling]

787
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,017
Fire!

788
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,362
I didn't want this.
I tried to avoid a fight.

789
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,239
That's why I took up medicine.

790
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,668
- Look at that idiot!
- Jonny! Jonny Miles!

791
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,752
Cease fire!

792
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,381
[bugle call]

793
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,061
- [Kendall] All right, move him up.
- [man] Move this man up.

794
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,900
Let me be of assistance.
I'm a physician. Dr. Marvin.

795
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,319
Major Kendall. We appreciate your help.

796
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,572
This man is next.

797
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,416
[man groans]

798
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,921
Go get some air.

799
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,758
- I can help.
- Get out.

800
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,602
Get him out of here.

801
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,584
Lou, you go and get some ice.
All you can find.

802
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,294
You too. You help him. Quick.

803
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,018
[steam hissing]

804
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,873
[booming]

805
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,562
How long are you going to be, Kendall?

806
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,897
Take a look for yourself.
We just started.

807
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,943
- I need a definite answer.
- I can't give you one.

808
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,904
I've got a job to do too, you know.

809
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,199
[sighs] At least five hours.

810
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,329
Colonel. Hey, Colonel.

811
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,586
Hello, trooper.

812
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,922
I'm Hoskins. Bud Hoskins.

813
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,340
K Company, sir.

814
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,178
- You don't know me.
- Sure I know you.

815
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,723
Good soldier. You just lie easy, son.

816
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,018
I put my hand on there and it's all...

817
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,521
Just lie still.

818
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:59,527
You'll write my ma, Colonel?
She'd love it if you...

819
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,989
You'll be writing her yourself
before long.

820
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,408
No.

821
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,911
No, I know.

822
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:11,331
- And I'm scared, Colonel.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

823
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,586
No, I'm all right.

824
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,129
Just hold onto me, sir.

825
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:21,216
And write my ma.

826
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,636
I'll be in your debt forever.

827
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,238
Aren't you proud?

828
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,951
Yes, I'm very proud of that boy.

829
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,044
- Report.
- Three dead, 18 wounded.

830
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:02,423
Demolition proceeding as ordered, sir.
And the bar is closed.

831
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,259
The bar is open!

832
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:29,117
- Get some laudanum.
- There is no more, sir.

833
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:40,211
[shouting]

834
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,633
Come down out of there, buster,
unless you want to go up with it.

835
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:58,313
- [boom]
- [glasses rattle]

836
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,821
Well, John, there goes half a million
dollars of railroad equipment.

837
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:10,575
That's how I made my living, you know.
Building railroads.

838
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:19,459
The railroad's finished for eight miles!
North and south...

839
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,759
John, what are you doing? Wait a minute!

840
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,845
- John!
- Get out!

841
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,556
- You figure this is a hospital?
- Listen to me.

842
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,018
And I can do it to Colonels, too!
Get out of here.

843
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,521
[distant booming]

844
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,939
[glass shatters]

845
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:59,957
When we move out, give your people,
the wounded, a lot of liquor.

846
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,836
I'd do that anyway.

847
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,762
- [glasses clattering]
- [booming continues]

848
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,320
[sobs]

849
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,656
Here, take this.

850
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:33,991
It will steady you down.

851
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,419
I've never seen it this way before.

852
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,757
I was with my father when he died.

853
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,302
But he died peacefully.

854
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:58,307
- Without pain.
- Well, it was lucky.

855
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,227
For both of you.

856
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:06,524
- [man groaning loudly]
- Go ahead, Kendall! Have a field day!

857
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,818
What do you mean, field day?

858
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:11,028
He's fighting to save men's lives.

859
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,449
Men's lives?
Or the reputation of his profession?

860
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,829
- You can't be serious, Colonel Marlowe.
- Have it your way, ma'am.

861
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:27,378
- Medicine is the most noble...
- Sure, noble profession, noble oath.

862
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:29,797
Lanterns held on high.

863
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,301
So high they won't admit
they're groping for...

864
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:38,431
You're...

865
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,603
- You're unfair and...
- Unfair?

866
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:50,276
There was a girl not much older
than that boy in there.

867
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,321
I wasn't unfair then, understand?

868
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:59,744
Because they used a lot of fancy words
that a section hand wouldn't understand.

869
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,081
So I held her down
while two of 'em worked on her.

870
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,252
I trusted doctors then. Believed in 'em.

871
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,923
Because I was in love
and I didn't want to see her die.

872
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,887
A tumor, they said it was.

873
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,722
And it had to come out right away.

874
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:25,186
So they stuck a leather strap in her
mouth so she could bite off her screams

875
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:28,022
while they cut away to get in there.

876
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,775
And what did they find? Nothing!

877
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:35,905
Oh, they were sorry.
Sure, they'd made a mistake.

878
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:39,450
They had something to talk about
before their next experiment.

879
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,788
But what about me?
They left me begging her not to die.

880
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,956
And I lost my wife.

881
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,003
I didn't kill either one of them.

882
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:56,008
I must have been crazy,
or too conventional.

883
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,307
Quite a speech.
I guess I'm feeling my liquor.

884
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:10,439
[men shouting]

885
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,259
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

886
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,344
[bugle call]

887
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,186
Thanks, Hank.

888
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,861
- Well, we almost fooled you.
- Almost.

889
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:02,408
You'll never make it, Hank.
They're already closing in on you.

890
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,369
Bedford Forest
is sniffing at your heels.

891
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:09,498
You're headed straight
for that prison at Andersonville.

892
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,792
There's nothing we can do
to help you there, Hank.

893
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,711
The South is starving.

894
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,007
Jonathan, all I'm doing
is practicing medicine.

895
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:20,009
Old ironhead does all the thinking.

896
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:24,013
He thinks things pretty good.
West Point?

897
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:26,515
No, section hand.

898
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:32,313
- How are Susan and the kids?
- They're fine.

899
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,483
In Vicksburg.
I expect you'll be seeing them soon.

900
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:40,780
Nice try, Jonathan. Nice try.

901
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,410
See you in Vicksburg, Hoppy.

902
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,046
- Goodbye, Hoppy.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

903
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:01,592
I want to thank you
for all I've learned.

904
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,096
I shall endeavor
to get home alive as many as I can.

905
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,932
You're a good man, Hoppy.

906
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,852
After this thing is all over,
if we don't meet again,

907
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,729
be sure and finish medical school.

908
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,774
I shall make a point of it, sir.

909
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,409
Goodbye, Doctor. And good luck.

910
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:28,536
Thank you, Doctor, for all your help.

911
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:49,640
Vicksburg. They're headed
southwest to Baton Rouge.

912
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:51,892
Baton Rouge.

913
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,688
It's Baton Rouge, Major.
Tell General Forest.

914
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,913
[Secord] Yes, you can.
I'm on the board of inquiry.

915
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,082

01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,652
Sound assembly.

1071
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:02,464
Well, at least that
Holy Joe ain't no kid.

1072
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,980
[man shouting orders]

1073
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:28,364
[man] Halt! Front rank, kneel!

1074
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:31,576
- Ready!
- Miss Hunter...

1075
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:34,704
[man] Aim! Fire!

1076
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:44,631
[man] Rear rank, halt!

1077
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,050
Kneel!

1078
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:51,387
- Ready! Aim! Fire!
- [shrieks]

1079
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,938
What do you want to do?
Set up a field hospital?

1080
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:01,981
Yes, Mr. Colonel Marlowe,
what are you going to do now?

1081
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,150
With all due respect
to your presence, ma'am,

1082
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:06,319
I'm going to get
the hell out of here. Bugler!

1083
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:07,904
Sound recall!

1084
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,410
I told you to take care of this woman!

1085
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:16,955
[explosion]

1086
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:22,001
Hey Colonel, I got me a prisoner.
What do you want me to do with him?

1087
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:25,213
- Spank him.
- On the bottom?

1088
01:37:25,297 --> 01:37:26,714
Where do you think?

1089
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,510
[boy shouting]

1090
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:34,931
[men cheering]

1091
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,884
- [man] Halt!
- Hold it, Colonel.

1092
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,969
[men shouting]

1093
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:22,395
- Report.
- Rebs. They got the whole road blocked.

1094
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,315
- How many?
- A full regiment of regulars, sir.

1095
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:28,776
They got two pieces of artillery
and they're digging in along the road.

1096
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:38,912
The only thing to do is fight our way
back to Salt Springs and head east.

1097
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:43,833
- Haven't you seen that dust?
- Cavalry. Following us for three hours.

1098
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:50,131
Colonel, the deacon says he knows this
country real good. Don't you, Deacon?

1099
01:38:50,215 --> 01:38:51,591
Preaching the gospel,

1100
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:55,053
singing the praises of the Lord
hereabouts for years.

1101
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,889
It might be a good idea
to start praying right now.

1102
01:38:57,973 --> 01:39:02,477
The deacon smuggled runaway slaves
north out of here through the swamp.

1103
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:08,441
- With the underground railway.
- Could you smuggle us out south?

1104
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:11,194
Wait a minute John. Wait a minute.

1105
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,821
Why, that swamp is full
of quicksand, cotton mouth, rattlers...

1106
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:17,200
The Garden of Eden
had its sufferance too.

1107
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:20,286
Follow me, brother Colonel,
through the swamps

1108
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:25,875
all the way to the river Amite.
Lead kindly, Lord.

1109
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,336
All right, get yourself
a couple of fresh horses.

1110
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:34,425
By the right flank, take cover.

1111
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:55,196
Come on!

1112
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,188
[horse whinnies]

1113
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,066
[Marlowe] Come on! Come on! Come on!

1114
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,238
[man] Move out. Come on, boy.

1115
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:23,534
Come on, boy.

1116
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:27,580
Keep moving! Keep moving! Come on!

1117
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:34,545
Keep moving. Stay awake there, kid.

1118
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,799
Keep moving. Pick up your feet.

1119
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:41,552
John, how far do you figure
to Baton Rouge?

1120
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,221
40 miles.

1121
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:45,056
Keep alive in there!

1122
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:48,601
- You want me to apologize now or later?
- For what?

1123
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:52,063
- Keep moving!
- I never thought you could do it.

1124
01:41:52,147 --> 01:41:57,026
You know, John, I've given up
all thought of running for Congress.

1125
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,488
With this on my record,
by George, I can be Governor.

1126
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:02,657
- Keep moving!
- Governor of Michigan.

1127
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:05,201
- Stay alive!
- And you can name your own job.

1128
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:06,285
Railroad commissioner...

1129
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:10,164
I wouldn't start making
campaign promises till we get there.

1130
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,457
Join your regiment.

1131
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,586
Colonel, my duty, medically speaking,
is to inform you that

1132
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:18,464
some of these men may make it
on their hands and knees.

1133
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:21,884
We've been 20 hours without a stop.
We need a rest.

1134
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,845
I've got eyes, Kendall.

1135
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:27,306
It's also my duty to inform you
that if we run into a fight...

1136
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,101
That is all, Doctor.

1137
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,978
Thank you, sir.

scout the other side of the bridge.

1141
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:20,818

[hooves clatter on bridge]

1143
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,216
I don't know if you've heard.

1144
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,720
Your people are about an hour
behind us, coming fast.

1145
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:49,096
I've heard.

1146
01:43:50,807 --> 01:43:55,228
We're going on to Baton Rouge.
We'll leave you here.

1147
01:43:56,855 --> 01:43:58,940
Your own kind can take care of you.

1148
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:02,985
- I'm sure they can.
- Yes.

1149
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:07,531
I...

1150
01:44:09,952 --> 01:44:14,080
I'm sorry for the hardship and...

1151
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:18,292
the humiliation that we've...

1152
01:44:18,377 --> 01:44:20,378
that I've caused you.

1153

[gunfire]

1154
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,516

Get her in that cabin!

1158
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:55,496
Come on, Miss Hannah.

1159
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:09,385
Looks like they've got us in a trap.

1160
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,681
[gunfire continues]

1161
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:15,975
Knock on it!

1162
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,318
Give us some cover!

1163
01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:38,456
Captain Woodward, move!

1164
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:52,053
Leave me alone.

1165
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:56,057
I'm all right. Let me alone, would you?

1166
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:05,983
[gunfire continues]

1167
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,361
Easy.

1168
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:12,782
Get Colonel Secord right away.
Not that way, the other door.

1169
01:46:12,866 --> 01:46:15,034
- Report.
- It's alive with rebs, sir.

1170
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:17,203
And I seen at least two cannons.

1171
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:20,289
- They jumped us so quick.
- Infantry?

1172
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,874
- The wood's full of 'em.
- Join your troop.

1173
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:23,334
Yes sir.

1174
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:26,045
- Cut his boot off, Sam.
- Nobody's cutting that boot off.

1175
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:27,713
- I got a lot of work to do.
- Cut his boot off.

1176
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:34,637
Take a good stiff jolt.

1177
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:40,601
Those are $20 boots, trooper.

1178
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,858
- Get some water.
- Who, me?

1179
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:58,452
Take A-troop and that reverend,
or whatever he is.

1180
01:46:58,995 --> 01:47:03,791
Find a ford someway across that river.
Flank 'em. Take a bugler with you.

1181
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:07,461
Yes sir. Thank you for the opportunity.

1182
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:54,717
John, we've ridden right into a trap.
They want us to cross that bridge.

1183
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:57,136
It'd be like going through a funnel.

1184
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,805
We've accomplished our purpose, John.

1185
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:04,268
In a position like this, there's nothing
disgraceful about honorable surrender.

1186
01:48:04,352 --> 01:48:08,272
Get back to your troop.
Keep 'em under cover.

1187
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:12,818
- You mean... you're going on?
- Get out of here!

1188
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:16,572
You're not going far
with that bullet in you.

1189
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:21,827
You're taking your own sweet time
about cutting it out of there.

1190
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,663
You're not the only wounded man
here, Colonel. Get me my bag.

1191
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,958
Now, this is going to hurt a little.

1192
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,129
Go on with it, Kendall.

1193
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:35,758
- [grunts in pain]
- Keep that leg stretched.

Are you having fun?

1197
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:19,301
You're lucky.

1198
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:29,812
You may not believe it, Colonel,
but I bought you some time.

1199
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:35,985
- A couple of hours?
- Maybe more.

1200
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:38,112
Thanks.

1201
01:49:51,334 --> 01:49:54,003
- First Michigan in position, sir.
- First Illinois in position.

1202
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:56,005
We were in position first.

1203
01:49:58,216 --> 01:49:59,216
I'm all right.

1204
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:09,893
Get cracking.

1205
01:50:33,376 --> 01:50:36,337
God Almighty. Here he comes.

1206
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:41,717
Mount up.

1207
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:46,013
You heard me, Kirby. Mount up.

1208
01:50:46,097 --> 01:50:49,224
- You heard the Colonel! Mount up!

Colonel.

1210
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:13,666
The deacon found a place to ford.
The men ought to be in position by now.

1211
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:19,046
Thanks. Cover our rear.
See how much time we've got.

1212
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:20,130
Yes, sir.

1213
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:38,649
- Where's your horse?
- Back in the swamp, sir.

1214
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:45,072
- Lips dry?
- Yes, sir. But my bugle ain't.

1215
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:52,621
- Uncase the colors.
- You heard him.

1216
01:52:04,801 --> 01:52:05,843
You know your orders?

1217
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:09,012
John, You're not fit.
Let me lead this charge.

1218
01:52:09,097 --> 01:52:12,725
With a success like this,
I could land in the White House.

Forwards! Fire Paul.

1225
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:56,602
Company!

1226
01:54:04,754 --> 01:54:06,755
You're hurt, sir.

1227
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,591
Blow... Trumpet, blow.

1228
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:30,404
They can't give up.

1229
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:35,033
Maybe it's crazy, maybe it's brave.
Don't ask me to explain it. Nobody can.

1230
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,536
Come on, we're going to have
a lot of work to do.

1231
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:49,756
Bugler, sound recall.

1232
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,686
- [man] Got any more?
- [indistinct chatter]

1233
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,108
[man] Come on, give us some more.

1234
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:19,244
How much longer, Sergeant?
Sergeant Major.

1235
01:55:19,329 --> 01:55:20,537
Pretty near ready, sir.

1236
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:23,290
All right, boys! Hurry it up! Lay it in!

1237
01:55:23,374 --> 01:55:25,042
Knock on it! Knock on it!

1238
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:39,890
Come on out! Get out of there!

1239
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:46,772
- Can those men be moved?
- They're all critical.

1240
01:55:46,856 --> 01:55:49,441
- May I speak to them?
- I'd rather you didn't.

1241
01:55:49,525 --> 01:55:51,735
They've got to be quiet.
I've given them all the laudanum I have.

1242
01:55:52,737 --> 01:55:55,530
It's a lousy finish for good men.

1243
01:55:57,033 --> 01:56:00,077
There'll be a medic with that
reb column. Get your horse.

1244
01:56:00,161 --> 01:56:02,162
I can't count on that.

1245
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:05,123
You mean you're staying?

1246
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:08,627
- Medicine's where you find it.
- Even in Andersonville?

1247
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:10,504
Even in Andersonville.

1248
01:56:12,382 --> 01:56:17,302
I wouldn't blame you
if you slap it away. Shake hands?

1249
01:56:19,013 --> 01:56:23,266
- Doctor, Major Gray.
- All right, coming.

1250
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:25,727
When your next doctor
takes that bandage off...

1251
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,813
Yeah, I know. Tree moss.

1252
01:56:28,272 --> 01:56:29,731
So long, croaker.

1253
01:56:30,858 --> 01:56:32,401
Take care, section hand.

1254
01:56:58,886 --> 01:57:02,931
You're tired. You've helped a lot.
Thanks for it.

1255
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:09,104
A poor way of being grateful
after what I've put you through.

1256
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:15,277
- You'd better be going.
- Yes, I guess I'd better.

1257
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:19,364
Look, Hannah Hunter.

1258
01:57:21,242 --> 01:57:25,162
Thank God I won't be the cause
of hurting you any more.

1259
01:57:25,246 --> 01:57:28,123
Because it happens I'm in love with you.

1260
01:57:30,626 --> 01:57:32,878
- [distant bugle call]
- [distant shouting]

1261
01:57:32,962 --> 01:57:35,005
Tell her the rest when you get back.

1262
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:12,209
- One of your own, sir.
- Get going.

1263
01:58:12,293 --> 01:58:14,002
Colonel, they're right on my tail.

1264
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:44,533
[Marlowe] Let's go. Yah!

1265
01:59:18,151 --> 01:59:22,070
Doctor, could our regimental surgeon
be of any service to you?

1266
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:23,738
I'd be grateful.

1184
01:59:24,138 --> 01:59:24,738
