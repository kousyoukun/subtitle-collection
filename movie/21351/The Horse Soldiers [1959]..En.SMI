I left my love, my love I left

In the holler of a tree

General Hurlburt, by appointment.
<SYNC Start=159428><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=161139 End=165185><P Class=ZHCC>
- General Hurlburt and Colonel Marlowe.<br>- Steve, come in.
<SYNC Start=165311 End=167854><P Class=ZHCC>
Hello, Sam. Colonel Marlowe.
<SYNC Start=167854><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=169440 End=171483><P Class=ZHCC>
(exchange of greetings)
<SYNC Start=171609 End=174736><P Class=ZHCC>
- General Sherman, Colonel Marlowe.<br>- How do you do?
<SYNC Start=174862 End=177947><P Class=ZHCC>
Marlowe, I've been anxious to meet you.
<SYNC Start=177947><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=179158 End=182118><P Class=ZHCC>
- It's a privilege, sir.<br>- Sit down.
<SYNC Start=182118><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=183996 End=187791><P Class=ZHCC>
- Is this your first look at Vicksburg?<br>- Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=187917 End=193129><P Class=ZHCC>
We've been looking at it<br>for ten months, and we don't like it.
<SYNC Start=193255 End=198510><P Class=ZHCC>
Colonel, for your benefit, the war<br>on our side hasn't been going well at all.
<SYNC Start=198636 End=203807><P Class=ZHCC>
Not in Washington,<br>not in the newspapers, not in the field.
<SYNC Start=203933 End=207852><P Class=ZHCC>
To put it mildly, with less men<br>and less resources,
<SYNC Start=207978 End=211147><P Class=ZHCC>
the South has whipped us to a standstill.
<SYNC Start=211273 End=213316><P Class=ZHCC>
(cannon fire)
<SYNC Start=213316><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=213984 End=217070><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, if I could take Vicksburg...
<SYNC Start=217070><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=219949 End=223701><P Class=ZHCC>
the whole picture would change,<br>but I'd have to do it this summer.
<SYNC Start=223828 End=226079><P Class=ZHCC>
Or sit out here another year.
<SYNC Start=226205 End=230917><P Class=ZHCC>
Which might cost us 100,000 men.<br>It might cost us a war.
<SYNC Start=231043 End=237466><P Class=ZHCC>
Which brings this talk to their main source<br>of supply - and a thorn in our side.
<SYNC Start=237592 End=239635><P Class=ZHCC>
- Newton Station.<br>- Sam.
<SYNC Start=239761 End=244098><P Class=ZHCC>
Marlowe has worked out the details<br>of your plan pretty thoroughly.
<SYNC Start=244224 End=248853><P Class=ZHCC>
If I could get back to La Grange<br>right away, we could leave by Thursday.
<SYNC Start=248853><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=249729 End=251856><P Class=ZHCC>
Good. Who would your people be?
<SYNC Start=251982 End=256402><P Class=ZHCC>
My own First Illinois with Secord's<br>First Michigan and Second lowa.
<SYNC Start=256528 End=258737><P Class=ZHCC>
We'd be culled down to a short brigade.
<SYNC Start=258864 End=264118><P Class=ZHCC>
Cross at La Grange, down through Ripley,<br>New Albany, Houston...
<SYNC Start=264244 End=268956><P Class=ZHCC>
- Is there something wrong, sir?<br>- I know the map. Proceed.
<SYNC Start=269082 End=273711><P Class=ZHCC>
Anyway, the main trick is<br>no fighting until we hit Newton Station.
<SYNC Start=273837 End=276255><P Class=ZHCC>
How much track do you figure to destroy?
<SYNC Start=276381 End=281260><P Class=ZHCC>
As much as I can. At least enough<br>to keep them busy for a couple of months.
<SYNC Start=281386 End=285848><P Class=ZHCC>
Otherwise, the raid would<br>just be another horse ride.
<SYNC Start=285974 End=292772><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, Colonel, go ahead. All the rails,<br>ties, buildings, bridges, rolling stock.
<SYNC Start=292898 End=295983><P Class=ZHCC>
Sam, even if he should<br>get through to Newton Station,
<SYNC Start=296109 End=299195><P Class=ZHCC>
he'd be 300 miles dead centre<br>in the Confederacy.
<SYNC Start=299195><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=300030 End=304283><P Class=ZHCC>
- Have you thought how you'd get back?<br>- Have you, sir?
<SYNC Start=304283><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=305119 End=307162><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, I guess I asked for that.
<SYNC Start=307288 End=310957><P Class=ZHCC>
But I hate to think of you sitting it out<br>in Andersonville Prison.
<SYNC Start=311083 End=315128><P Class=ZHCC>
- It's a hellhole.<br>- I'd think about that twice, too, sir.
<SYNC Start=315128><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=316089 End=318340><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, Colonel, your success.
<SYNC Start=318340><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=320134 End=327224><P Class=ZHCC>
THE UNION CAVALRY DEPOT<br>AT LA GRANGE, TENNESSEE
<SYNC Start=327224><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=337443 End=339903><P Class=ZHCC>
All right, here is La Grange.
<SYNC Start=339903><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=340863 End=345575><P Class=ZHCC>
- We will make 35 miles a day, average.<br>- 35?
<SYNC Start=345701 End=348453><P Class=ZHCC>
35? Isn't that stretching it a bit?
<SYNC Start=348579 End=352415><P Class=ZHCC>
It will be the first day, Ned.<br>I intend to make twice that distance.
<SYNC Start=352542 End=355627><P Class=ZHCC>
In an operation like this,<br>everything is stretched.
<SYNC Start=355753 End=357796><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, just hold on a minute, John.
<SYNC Start=357922 End=360924><P Class=ZHCC>
Cutting the men's rations<br>from five days to three...
<SYNC Start=361050 End=365595><P Class=ZHCC>
They'll have to live off the land eventually.<br>They might as well get used to it.
<SYNC Start=365721 End=370892><P Class=ZHCC>
They seem excited. There's a rumour<br>they're headed for Nashville and a parade.
<SYNC Start=371018 End=374938><P Class=ZHCC>
That was a good rumour to spread,<br>with the help of the Sergeant Major.
<SYNC Start=375064 End=378151><P Class=ZHCC>
- Thank you, sir.<br>- And, gentlemen,
<SYNC Start=378277 End=381571><P Class=ZHCC>
I'll have to admit they had me fooled too.
<SYNC Start=381697 End=386826><P Class=ZHCC>
You see, I was going to use my leave<br>to do a little electioneering back home.
<SYNC Start=386952 End=390496><P Class=ZHCC>
You know, shake a few hands,<br>kiss a few babies.
<SYNC Start=390622 End=393708><P Class=ZHCC>
You see, I'm running for Congress this fall.
<SYNC Start=393834 End=397754><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, there's 30,000 votes<br>at Andersonville, Phil.
<SYNC Start=397880 End=401090><P Class=ZHCC>
I hope you don't get to shake<br>any of their hands.
<SYNC Start=401090><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=402509 End=407263><P Class=ZHCC>
Leaves are being cancelled,<br>orders to reshoe the whole blasted outfit,
<SYNC Start=407389 End=409766><P Class=ZHCC>
and some of them shoes<br>ain't even shiny yet.
<SYNC Start=409892 End=411559><P Class=ZHCC>
Yep.
<SYNC Start=411685 End=418274><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm trying to figure out what's up. They've<br>been sitting under that tree all morning.
<SYNC Start=418400 End=423780><P Class=ZHCC>
I heard some scuttlebutt about us being<br>pulled out for a big parade up North.
<SYNC Start=423906 End=427909><P Class=ZHCC>
- I figure we're heading for Nashville.<br>- That's to my liking.
<SYNC Start=428035 End=432288><P Class=ZHCC>
A parade, and then leave.<br>Now this war is starting to shape up.
<SYNC Start=432288><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=436460 End=441631><P Class=ZHCC>
- Where's the officers' conference?<br>- Over under that tree yonder, sir.
<SYNC Start=441757 End=443800><P Class=ZHCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=443800><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=455522 End=458607><P Class=ZHCC>
- My apologies for being late.<br>- Understood.
<SYNC Start=458733 End=462152><P Class=ZHCC>
- Sit down, Major.<br>- I don't believe I know the Major.
<SYNC Start=462278 End=465739><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm sorry.<br>Colonel Marlowe, Major Kendall.
<SYNC Start=465865 End=467699><P Class=ZHCC>
- How do you do?<br>- Glad to know you.
<SYNC Start=467826 End=472037><P Class=ZHCC>
Major Kendall has just been<br>assigned to us by General Grant.
<SYNC Start=472163 End=476750><P Class=ZHCC>
The Major seems to be out of uniform.<br>Where are your side arms, Kendall?
<SYNC Start=476750><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=477710 End=481171><P Class=ZHCC>
If you look in the book, you'll see<br>a surgeon doesn't carry them.
<SYNC Start=481171><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=483550 End=489179><P Class=ZHCC>
Surgeon? You cut out our artillery and<br>our wagons. Nothing to slow us down.
<SYNC Start=489305 End=492474><P Class=ZHCC>
And now you saddle us<br>with a doctor and a medical unit?
<SYNC Start=492600 End=495978><P Class=ZHCC>
Regulations, John. Kendall goes along.
<SYNC Start=496104 End=498272><P Class=ZHCC>
Very well, sir. Any questions?
<SYNC Start=498398 End=502025><P Class=ZHCC>
- All I can say is I'm glad for some action.<br>- No glory hunting.
<SYNC Start=502152 End=507030><P Class=ZHCC>
If anything knocks this into a cocked hat,<br>it'll be a firefight. Is that all, sir?
<SYNC Start=507157 End=511285><P Class=ZHCC>
- Logan, is Brady ready?<br>- Oh, a photograph.
<SYNC Start=511285><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=512787 End=515205><P Class=ZHCC>
Move away. Move back.
<SYNC Start=515331 End=518084><P Class=ZHCC>
Are you ready for us, Brady?
<SYNC Start=518084><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=521130 End=523631><P Class=ZHCC>
Colonel. Sit down, Colonel.
<SYNC Start=523631><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=524550 End=527010><P Class=ZHCC>
- Thank you very much.<br>- That's all right.
<SYNC Start=527136 End=531264><P Class=ZHCC>
- Sit down, Marlowe.<br>- No hats, please, gentlemen.
<SYNC Start=531264><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=533851 End=536060><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right. Nice and relaxed.
<SYNC Start=536060><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=536979 End=542275><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, roses are red, violets are blue,<br>the camera's looking straight at you.
<SYNC Start=542401 End=545904><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, I must have another one.<br>That man in the white coat moved.
<SYNC Start=546030 End=549908><P Class=ZHCC>
That isn't all he'll be moving before long.<br>General, is that all?
<SYNC Start=550034 End=553661><P Class=ZHCC>
That's all, gentlemen.<br>Thank you, Brady.
<SYNC Start=553788 End=557290><P Class=ZHCC>
Thank you, General.<br>Thank you very much.
<SYNC Start=557290><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=560252 End=562295><P Class=ZHCC>
Sit down.
<SYNC Start=562421 End=566382><P Class=ZHCC>
Colonel, I gather you're not too happy<br>about my going along.
<SYNC Start=566509 End=569385><P Class=ZHCC>
I hadn't counted on you, that's all.
<SYNC Start=569512 End=574307><P Class=ZHCC>
I can understand your reasons for<br>trying to avoid a fight, tactically speaking.
<SYNC Start=574433 End=577560><P Class=ZHCC>
But you're going very deep<br>into enemy territory.
<SYNC Start=577686 End=580897><P Class=ZHCC>
Tell me, what did you intend to do<br>about your wounded?
<SYNC Start=581023 End=583858><P Class=ZHCC>
I intend to move, and move fast.
<SYNC Start=583984 End=588238><P Class=ZHCC>
Those too badly shot up to carry on<br>will be left to the clemency of the enemy.
<SYNC Start=588238><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=588823 End=591951><P Class=ZHCC>
- Civilian or military.<br>- Including yourself?
<SYNC Start=592077 End=594120><P Class=ZHCC>
Naturally.
<SYNC Start=594120><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=595330 End=599291><P Class=ZHCC>
That's a pretty primitive attitude.<br>Medically speaking.
<SYNC Start=599417 End=604046><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, Doctor,<br>war isn't exactly a civilised business.
<SYNC Start=604172 End=609760><P Class=ZHCC>
Of course, I realise that it gives you fellas<br>a wider field of opportunity...
<SYNC Start=609886 End=613180><P Class=ZHCC>
- For experimenting, Colonel?<br>- I didn't say that.
<SYNC Start=613306 End=615057><P Class=ZHCC>
- Mitch.<br>- Yes, sir?
<SYNC Start=615183 End=618811><P Class=ZHCC>
- Give the doctor a full roster.<br>- Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=618937 End=620855><P Class=ZHCC>
Examine every man.
<SYNC Start=620981 End=626527><P Class=ZHCC>
Throw out any man who - in your<br>unchallenged opinion, of course - is unfit.
<SYNC Start=626653 End=631323><P Class=ZHCC>
Even those who might get sick<br>a week from today.
<SYNC Start=631450 End=634285><P Class=ZHCC>
Look, I didn't ask<br>to be assigned to this mission.
<SYNC Start=634411 End=638539><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm a military doctor. I've been ordered<br>to go and I'm going to do my job.
<SYNC Start=638665 End=640916><P Class=ZHCC>
So get off my back.
<SYNC Start=640916><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=649176 End=651677><P Class=ZHCC>
- Bugler!<br>- Yes, sir?
<SYNC Start=651803 End=656474><P Class=ZHCC>
- Get me Mitchell.<br>- Sergeant Major Mitchell's in the hospital.
<SYNC Start=656474><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=668029 End=670614><P Class=ZHCC>
- How old are you?<br>- 32, sir.
<SYNC Start=670614><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=671949 End=674451><P Class=ZHCC>
Join that group.
<SYNC Start=674451><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=681959 End=684211><P Class=ZHCC>
Hang on, son. Here we go.
<SYNC Start=684211><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=685797 End=687839><P Class=ZHCC>
(yells)
<SYNC Start=687839><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=690218 End=692260><P Class=ZHCC>
(metal clanks)
<SYNC Start=692260><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=692929 End=695472><P Class=ZHCC>
This is going to hurt worse.
<SYNC Start=695472><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=703773 End=705857><P Class=ZHCC>
There. He'll be all right.
<SYNC Start=705857><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=710029 End=713698><P Class=ZHCC>
- I got your sick list, Kendall.<br>- Good. I'm glad it's a short one.
<SYNC Start=713825 End=715659><P Class=ZHCC>
We'll let that drain full out.
<SYNC Start=715785 End=718662><P Class=ZHCC>
- I approve of that, Doctor.<br>- The lad had quite a boil.
<SYNC Start=718788 End=722040><P Class=ZHCC>
I didn't come here to watch you<br>carving anybody's behind.
<SYNC Start=722166 End=726503><P Class=ZHCC>
- Why's Mitchell's name on that list?<br>- Sir, we observe quiet here.
<SYNC Start=726629 End=729131><P Class=ZHCC>
- What's this?<br>- Hoppy, this is Colonel Marlowe.
<SYNC Start=729257 End=734220><P Class=ZHCC>
How do you do? Stand in line.<br>We'll take care of you presently.
<SYNC Start=734346 End=737432><P Class=ZHCC>
- Is he going with us?<br>- He's a good man. I need him.
<SYNC Start=737558 End=742728><P Class=ZHCC>
- I need Mitchell. He's strong as a bull.<br>- Let me show you something.
<SYNC Start=742728><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=746233 End=752113><P Class=ZHCC>
Colonel, I've been trying to tell the doctor<br>that this is nothing unusual.
<SYNC Start=752239 End=754699><P Class=ZHCC>
Not for a man with malaria.
<SYNC Start=754825 End=757577><P Class=ZHCC>
There's nothing new about this, Kendall.
<SYNC Start=757703 End=761080><P Class=ZHCC>
I've seen him ride 40 miles<br>in one day, shivering.
<SYNC Start=761206 End=764500><P Class=ZHCC>
- He always gets malaria.<br>- So you concur in my diagnosis.
<SYNC Start=764626 End=766961><P Class=ZHCC>
Mitch, get out of bed. I got some whiskey.
<SYNC Start=767087 End=769213><P Class=ZHCC>
You stay where you are, Sergeant.
<SYNC Start=769339 End=775178><P Class=ZHCC>
I was ordered to take off the duty roster<br>any man who in my opinion was unfit.
<SYNC Start=775304 End=778681><P Class=ZHCC>
He's sick and he's going to stay here.<br>Those are my orders.
<SYNC Start=778807 End=782310><P Class=ZHCC>
You've read the whole book, haven't you?
<SYNC Start=782310><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=784730 End=786773><P Class=ZHCC>

It's just that I never prepared myself to see<br>that uniform within the walls of this house.
<SYNC Start=1563853 End=1567064><P Class=ZHCC>
Ma'am, we no more wish to be here<br>than you do to have us.

Why, that's gallantly spoken, Colonel.

No matter what our differences,<br>I fear I'm forgetting the amenities.

And during our stay no one will<br>be allowed to leave the premises.

Wherever would we go, Colonel?
<SYNC Start=1626883 End=1631512><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm sure you must agree that this war<br>makes loneliness for everyone.

Also, I must commandeer most<br>of the grain and horses, if you have any.
<SYNC Start=1636476 End=1641313><P Class=ZHCC>
You will be paid, Miss Hunter,<br>for everything, in Union greenbacks.

We will not bother you<br>any longer. Good evening.

It's uncanny, Colonel.

I've heard about 'em, but I didn't believe it.

The question is this man's authority<br>in his present position.

As usual, I am trying to present<br>the grim facts of life.

He doesn't understand<br>that coffee tastes better

if the latrines are dug<br>downstream instead of upstream.

How do you like your coffee, Colonel?
<SYNC Start=1691699 End=1694034><P Class=ZHCC>

Colonel! Colonel Marlowe!

Well, I don't believe<br>I've met these gentlemen.

Miss Hunter. Colonel Secord.<br>Major Gray. Major Kendall.

Poor Papa and Mama must be<br>turning over in their graves at me

for not extending what little hospitality<br>Greenbriar can offer.

At least I can extend<br>an invitation to you for dinner.
<SYNC Start=1732616 End=1735534><P Class=ZHCC>
- No, Miss Hunter...<br>- I insist.
<SYNC Start=1735661 End=1738746><P Class=ZHCC>
There's three fat capons<br>that have to go anyhow.
<SYNC Start=1738872 End=1743876><P Class=ZHCC>
What with our store of grain<br>being reduced, like you mentioned.
<SYNC Start=1744002 End=1747463><P Class=ZHCC>
So, you see, you brought it<br>on yourself, didn't you?
<SYNC Start=1747589 End=1750758><P Class=ZHCC>
Speaking for myself,<br>I would be delighted...
<SYNC Start=1750884 End=1754804><P Class=ZHCC>
Very well, thank you.<br>Hot food is pretty hard to turn down.
<SYNC Start=1754930 End=1757682><P Class=ZHCC>
Splendid. Now, how many can I count on?
<SYNC Start=1757808 End=1760393><P Class=ZHCC>
- Would five or six be...?<br>- Not at all.
<SYNC Start=1760519 End=1762562><P Class=ZHCC>
Perfectly wonderful.
<SYNC Start=1762688 End=1764480><P Class=ZHCC>
At nine, gentlemen?
<SYNC Start=1764606 End=1767358><P Class=ZHCC>
- Colonel Secord?<br>- Of the First Michigan, ma'am.
<SYNC Start=1767484 End=1769610><P Class=ZHCC>
- Major Gray?<br>- Ma'am.
<SYNC Start=1769736 End=1772029><P Class=ZHCC>
Major... Kendall, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=1772029><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1772948 End=1777326><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm afraid I'll have to regret, ma'am.<br>It's not of my choice, I assure you.
<SYNC Start=1777452 End=1779912><P Class=ZHCC>
At the moment, I'm under arrest.
<SYNC Start=1780038 End=1783874><P Class=ZHCC>
We will all be glad to accept<br>the invitation, Miss Hunter.
<SYNC Start=1783874><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1799684 End=1801852><P Class=ZHCC>
Ma'am?
<SYNC Start=1801978 End=1804730><P Class=ZHCC>
You dropped your handkerchief.
<SYNC Start=1804730><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1806149 End=1810360><P Class=ZHCC>
- Care for a little more, Colonel Secord?<br>- No, thank you, ma'am.
<SYNC Start=1810486 End=1812613><P Class=ZHCC>
Colonel Marlowe?
<SYNC Start=1812739 End=1815449><P Class=ZHCC>
- No, thank you.<br>- Come now, Colonel.
<SYNC Start=1815575 End=1821788><P Class=ZHCC>
A man with a big frame like yours can't<br>just nibble away like a little old titmouse.
<SYNC Start=1821788><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1822874 End=1825834><P Class=ZHCC>
Gentlemen, please be seated.
<SYNC Start=1825960 End=1831715><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, what was your preference?<br>The leg... or the breast?
<SYNC Start=1831715><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1835845 End=1839348><P Class=ZHCC>
I've had quite enough of both, thank you.
<SYNC Start=1839474 End=1841516><P Class=ZHCC>
What a shame.
<SYNC Start=1841516><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1844270 End=1847981><P Class=ZHCC>
- Would anyone else like some more?<br>- (all) No, thank you.
<SYNC Start=1848107 End=1853987><P Class=ZHCC>
Gentlemen, be seated.<br>I must warn you too, there's no coffee.
<SYNC Start=1854113 End=1858158><P Class=ZHCC>
And a sweet or a dessert of any kind<br>was just out of the question.
<SYNC Start=1858284 End=1860619><P Class=ZHCC>
Sugar's $150 a barrel.
<SYNC Start=1860745 End=1865666><P Class=ZHCC>
"And yet your fair discourse<br>hath been as sweet as sugar,
<SYNC Start=1865792 End=1869504><P Class=ZHCC>
making the hard way<br>sweet and delectable."
<SYNC Start=1869504><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1870798 End=1874425><P Class=ZHCC>
How perfectly charming.<br>A little something of your own?
<SYNC Start=1874551 End=1877095><P Class=ZHCC>
No, ma'am. Richard II.
<SYNC Start=1877221 End=1881808><P Class=ZHCC>
- By profession, I'm an actor.<br>- Why, how fascinating!
<SYNC Start=1881934 End=1887146><P Class=ZHCC>
Why, Major Kendall, your cigar.<br>Gentlemen, please be seated.
<SYNC Start=1887273 End=1889607><P Class=ZHCC>
(sighs)
<SYNC Start=1889733 End=1895613><P Class=ZHCC>
Major Kendall a doctor. And<br>Colonel Secord almost a congressman.
<SYNC Start=1895739 End=1900118><P Class=ZHCC>
And you an actor.<br>And now all military men.
<SYNC Start=1900244 End=1902495><P Class=ZHCC>
Such a waste of talent.
<SYNC Start=1902621 End=1907834><P Class=ZHCC>
But, of course, Colonel Marlowe, I imagine<br>that you are a professional soldier.
<SYNC Start=1907960 End=1911963><P Class=ZHCC>
No, prior to this insanity,<br>I was a railroad engineer.
<SYNC Start=1911963><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1912590 End=1914465><P Class=ZHCC>
Why, how thrilling.
<SYNC Start=1914592 End=1920138><P Class=ZHCC>
To think of being able to steer one of<br>those huge things, puffing and steaming.
<SYNC Start=1920264 End=1923641><P Class=ZHCC>
Ringing that little bell.<br>Ding-dong! Ding-dong!
<SYNC Start=1923767 End=1928187><P Class=ZHCC>
Not quite. My job was<br>in the construction of railroads.
<SYNC Start=1928187><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1929356 End=1932609><P Class=ZHCC>
Why, my! Such brilliant minds.
<SYNC Start=1932735 End=1938239><P Class=ZHCC>
Poor little me barely squeezed through<br>Miss Longstreet's Seminary for Ladies.
<SYNC Start=1938365 End=1941994><P Class=ZHCC>
How did you ever manage<br>to remember all those books in college?
<SYNC Start=1942120 End=1948083><P Class=ZHCC>
I didn't. I started driving<br>rail spikes at ten cents a day and found.
<SYNC Start=1948209 End=1950836><P Class=ZHCC>
And now, Miss Hunter,<br>I must ask you to leave us.
<SYNC Start=1950962 End=1955633><P Class=ZHCC>
We are taking the privilege of using<br>this room for an hour or two. If we may.
<SYNC Start=1955759 End=1960554><P Class=ZHCC>
Of course, but wouldn't you prefer<br>using another room? The study, perhaps?
<SYNC Start=1960680 End=1964558><P Class=ZHCC>
- We're quite comfortable here.<br>- (murmurs of agreement)
<SYNC Start=1964684 End=1967770><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm sorry but I must be rude and explain.
<SYNC Start=1967896 End=1972107><P Class=ZHCC>
Lukey and I must be in the fields<br>by five in the morning.
<SYNC Start=1972234 End=1975611><P Class=ZHCC>
Gentlemen, go ahead<br>and light your cigars.
<SYNC Start=1975737 End=1977988><P Class=ZHCC>
- Allow me.<br>- Thank you kindly.
<SYNC Start=1978114 End=1981659><P Class=ZHCC>
All this and the dishes must be done<br>before she can get to bed.
<SYNC Start=1981785 End=1985579><P Class=ZHCC>
- Am I being too inconsiderate?<br>- Of course not, ma'am.
<SYNC Start=1985705 End=1988958><P Class=ZHCC>
- May I?<br>- Of course. This way, gentlemen.
<SYNC Start=1989334 End=1991752><P Class=ZHCC>
How wonderful.
<SYNC Start=1991752><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1992629 End=1996548><P Class=ZHCC>
Really, I thought it was a charming dinner.
<SYNC Start=1996548><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2000637 End=2003472><P Class=ZHCC>
- Post this room.<br>- Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=2003598 End=2008644><P Class=ZHCC>
- I hope you'll be comfortable here.<br>- Oh, yes. This is fine.
<SYNC Start=2008644><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2010648 End=2014276><P Class=ZHCC>
- If you wish to light a fire, it's ready.<br>- No, it's fine.
<SYNC Start=2014402 End=2018863><P Class=ZHCC>
- Some brandy. I'll have Lukey bring it.<br>- No, thank you, no brandy.
<SYNC Start=2018990 End=2021741><P Class=ZHCC>
Are you sure there's<br>nothing more that I can...
<SYNC Start=2021867 End=2023368><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, yes.
<SYNC Start=2023494 End=2026204><P Class=ZHCC>
Doctor, there's no need<br>for you to be a part of this.
<SYNC Start=2026330 End=2031459><P Class=ZHCC>
Perhaps Miss Hunter would show you<br>some of the beauties of Greenbriar.
<SYNC Start=2031586 End=2036172><P Class=ZHCC>
- Why, of course, if he has any interest...<br>- He'd be pleased to.
<SYNC Start=2036299 End=2039175><P Class=ZHCC>
Very well. Come, then, Doctor.
<SYNC Start=2039175><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2041637 End=2044806><P Class=ZHCC>
I noticed a lovely garden.<br>Shall we take a stroll?
<SYNC Start=2044806><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2045474 End=2047309><P Class=ZHCC>
Why, of course.
<SYNC Start=2047435 End=2051187><P Class=ZHCC>
You know, you gentlemen must be<br>comfortable in your heavy uniforms,
<SYNC Start=2051314 End=2056067><P Class=ZHCC>
but I feel a definite chill in the air -<br>it's me and my thin blood.
<SYNC Start=2056193 End=2059029><P Class=ZHCC>
Would you excuse me<br>while I go and fetch a shawl?
<SYNC Start=2059155 End=2061489><P Class=ZHCC>
- Miss Hunter.<br>- Yes, Major?
<SYNC Start=2061489><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2063159 End=2065452><P Class=ZHCC>
I'm afraid I'll have to go with you.
<SYNC Start=2065578 End=2068038><P Class=ZHCC>
Upstairs? With me?
<SYNC Start=2068164 End=2070624><P Class=ZHCC>
- Why, Major!<br>- You're only getting a shawl.
<SYNC Start=2070750 End=2073960><P Class=ZHCC>
Of course,<br>but in these parts it's unheard of...
<SYNC Start=2074086 End=2076630><P Class=ZHCC>
It's something<br>to tell your grandchildren.
<SYNC Start=2076756 End=2080634><P Class=ZHCC>
This is war. At the moment,<br>Greenbriar is a military installation.
<SYNC Start=2080760 End=2085556><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't suppose there's any real harm,<br>being that you're a doctor.
<SYNC Start=2085682 End=2087725><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right.
<SYNC Start=2087725><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2092648 End=2097526><P Class=ZHCC>
Lukey, bring some brandy<br>to my sitting room, please.
<SYNC Start=2097526><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2102449 End=2106535><P Class=ZHCC>
- I hope you'll be comfortable here, Major.<br>- Thank you.
<SYNC Start=2106535><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2123553 End=2125596><P Class=ZHCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=2125596><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2132604 End=2136232><P Class=ZHCC>
Hey! Where are you going with that?
<SYNC Start=2136358 End=2140236><P Class=ZHCC>
- Miss Hannah asked for this brandy.<br>- I know, for the Major.
<SYNC Start=2140362 End=2145032><P Class=ZHCC>
We never give any of our top-ranking<br>officers an unlabelled bottle,
<SYNC Start=2145158 End=2148035><P Class=ZHCC>
unless somebody tastes it first.
<SYNC Start=2148161 End=2150997><P Class=ZHCC>
- Is this what you does? Test things?<br>- Certainly.
<SYNC Start=2151123 End=2155836><P Class=ZHCC>
See that second stripe? That means<br>I'm official taster for majors on up.
<SYNC Start=2155836><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2158506 End=2160757><P Class=ZHCC>
Here's La Grange.
<SYNC Start=2160883 End=2166179><P Class=ZHCC>
We've come down here<br>approximately 80 miles.
<SYNC Start=2166306 End=2171893><P Class=ZHCC>
- We're headed for Newton Station.<br>- Any word on the enemy strength there?
<SYNC Start=2172020 End=2176523><P Class=ZHCC>
No, not a word. Whatever it is,<br>we're obliged to take it on.
<SYNC Start=2176649 End=2180777><P Class=ZHCC>
- Good. Maybe we'll see action.<br>- This is not play-acting.
<SYNC Start=2180777><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2184616 End=2187284><P Class=ZHCC>
- Here's your brandy, sir.<br>- Oh, thank you.
<SYNC Start=2187410 End=2191121><P Class=ZHCC>
- It's all tested.<br>- Tested?
<SYNC Start=2191247 End=2195876><P Class=ZHCC>
By the man downstairs with<br>those tester's stripes, for majors on up.
<SYNC Start=2196002 End=2198879><P Class=ZHCC>
Oh, yes. Sergeant Kirby.
<SYNC Start=2199005 End=2203425><P Class=ZHCC>
- He really tested it, didn't he?<br>- Yes, sir. Twice.
<SYNC Start=2203551 End=2205886><P Class=ZHCC>
- Lukey?<br>- Yes, Miss Hannah.
<SYNC Start=2205886><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2208598 End=2210641><P Class=ZHCC>
Excuse me, sir.
<SYNC Start=2210641><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2220693 End=2222819><P Class=ZHCC>
(Marlowe)... very lucky.
<SYNC Start=2222819><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2229453 End=2233581><P Class=ZHCC>
(officers' voices)
<SYNC Start=2233707 End=2239504><P Class=ZHCC>
That is the next piece of information.<br>We're not going back to La Grange.
<SYNC Start=2239630 End=2243466><P Class=ZHCC>
- We're what?<br>- We're not going back north.
<SYNC Start=2243592 End=2250765><P Class=ZHCC>
We're heading south to Baton Rouge<br>to join up with the Union forces there.
<SYNC Start=2250891 End=2255853><P Class=ZHCC>
- Great Scott, when did you decide that?<br>- It's the best way. It's the only way.
<SYNC Start=2255980 End=2261901><P Class=ZHCC>
John, it is 300 miles<br>from Newton Station to Baton Rouge.
<SYNC Start=2262027 End=2266155><P Class=ZHCC>
And it is 300 miles<br>from Newton Station to La Grange.
<SYNC Start=2266282 End=2271661><P Class=ZHCC>
Only the rebs will really have been closed<br>in behind us, ready to chew us to bits.
<SYNC Start=2271787 End=2274998><P Class=ZHCC>
So we'll go out the way<br>they least expect: Straight south.
<SYNC Start=2275124 End=2280545><P Class=ZHCC>
Damn it, it's suicide. Is it possible your<br>orders could have been misinterpreted?
<SYNC Start=2280671 End=2282714><P Class=ZHCC>
My only duty after Newton Station
<SYNC Start=2282840 End=2286593><P Class=ZHCC>
is to get as many of these men<br>back alive as I can.
<SYNC Start=2286593><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2290014 End=2292599><P Class=ZHCC>
(Secord) And so I still must protest.
<SYNC Start=2292725 End=2295894><P Class=ZHCC>
What's more, I want that<br>on the record for General Hurlburt.
<SYNC Start=2296021 End=2298355><P Class=ZHCC>
It is impetuous mass suicide.
<SYNC Start=2298481 End=2301150><P Class=ZHCC>
(Marlowe) It's on the record, but get this.
<SYNC Start=2301276 End=2305446><P Class=ZHCC>
Unless enemy action allows you to<br>take my place, that's the way it will be.
<SYNC Start=2305572 End=2309199><P Class=ZHCC>
Blow Newton Station off the map,<br>then through to Baton Rouge.
<SYNC Start=2309326 End=2312202><P Class=ZHCC>
There will be no change.<br>Do you understand?
<SYNC Start=2312329 End=2314455><P Class=ZHCC>
(Secord) All right, you're in command.
<SYNC Start=2314581 End=2318918><P Class=ZHCC>
(Marlowe) Now let's go over it again.<br>Straight through to Baton Rouge.
<SYNC Start=2319044 End=2321128><P Class=ZHCC>
We will not turn back.
<SYNC Start=2321128><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2323423 End=2327176><P Class=ZHCC>
Sorry for keeping you waiting.<br>Was the brandy satisfactory?
<SYNC Start=2327302 End=2332139><P Class=ZHCC>
- Excellent. Won't you join me?<br>- Goodness me, no. I never touch spirits.
<SYNC Start=2332265 End=2336393><P Class=ZHCC>
My papa taught me that a girl ought<br>to keep her wits about her at all times.
<SYNC Start=2336519 End=2338896><P Class=ZHCC>
Your father raised a very smart girl.
<SYNC Start=2339022 End=2342024><P Class=ZHCC>
You're being sweet.<br>Would you like to see the garden?
<SYNC Start=2342150 End=2344693><P Class=ZHCC>
Didn't you forget your shawl?
<SYNC Start=2344693><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2345654 End=2347696><P Class=ZHCC>
Why, Lukey!
<SYNC Start=2347696><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2353870 End=2359792><P Class=ZHCC>
Now, Lukey, you take that tray downstairs<br>and go about doing what you have to do.
<SYNC Start=2359918 End=2365422><P Class=ZHCC>
You know, I remember the first time I tried<br>spirits, at the Governor's Ball in Jackson.
<SYNC Start=2365549 End=2370929><P Class=ZHCC>
My escort, Adam Lovelace from Biloxi,<br>well, he gave me a mint julep.
<SYNC Start=2371055 End=2374933><P Class=ZHCC>
You know, those Lovelace boys<br>are all very handsome, but fast,
<SYNC Start=2375059 End=2377060><P Class=ZHCC>
if you know what I mean.
<SYNC Start=2377186 End=2382357><P Class=ZHCC>
If I could tell you the thoughts that went<br>on in my mind after that one julep... My!
<SYNC Start=2382483 End=2386027><P Class=ZHCC>
I'd rather know the thoughts<br>going on in your mind right now.
<SYNC Start=2386027><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2388322 End=2391992><P Class=ZHCC>
- Kendall, what in the name of...?<br>- Sorry we have to interrupt.
<SYNC Start=2392118 End=2394494><P Class=ZHCC>
Ask them what they<br>think your chances are
<SYNC Start=2394620 End=2397706><P Class=ZHCC>
of blowing up Newton Station<br>and getting to Baton Rouge.
<SYNC Start=2397832 End=2401668><P Class=ZHCC>
- Are you drunk?<br>- Unfortunately, no.
<SYNC Start=2401794 End=2403670><P Class=ZHCC>
They were listening upstairs.
<SYNC Start=2403670><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2409135 End=2412429><P Class=ZHCC>
Makes a pretty good stethoscope.
<SYNC Start=2412555 End=2415056><P Class=ZHCC>
Don't feel guilty.<br>I was slow to catch on too.
<SYNC Start=2415182 End=2417058><P Class=ZHCC>
Where were you, Kendall?
<SYNC Start=2417184 End=2421104><P Class=ZHCC>
Well, a gentlemen thinks twice<br>before peeking into a lady's bedroom,
<SYNC Start=2421230 End=2423356><P Class=ZHCC>
but sometimes it pays off.
<SYNC Start=2423482 End=2426443><P Class=ZHCC>
Looks like she's made<br>a fool out of both of us.
<SYNC Start=2426569 End=2429154><P Class=ZHCC>
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.
<SYNC Start=2429154><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2431198 End=2433742><P Class=ZHCC>
You know something, Miss Hunter?
<SYNC Start=2433868 End=2436244><P Class=ZHCC>
You have put me<br>to quite an inconvenience.
<SYNC Start=2436370 End=2438915><P Class=ZHCC>
At least I've accomplished something, sir.
<SYNC Start=2439041 End=2444003><P Class=ZHCC>
I don't suppose I could accept your word<br>of honour not to discuss this with anyone.
<SYNC Start=2444129 End=2447214><P Class=ZHCC>
- I don't hold to honour with any Yankees.<br>- Exactly.
<SYNC Start=2447341 End=2450301><P Class=ZHCC>
So the whole state of Mississippi<br>will be alerted.
<SYNC Start=2450427 End=2453429><P Class=ZHCC>
So could you possibly suggest<br>what I should do with you?
<SYNC Start=2453555 End=2457433><P Class=ZHCC>
I noticed she was getting on your nerves.<br>Now's your chance to shoot her.
<SYNC Start=2457559 End=2461562><P Class=ZHCC>
- One more word out of you...<br>- Go ahead. Shoot us.
<SYNC Start=2461688 End=2463522><P Class=ZHCC>
Shoot both of us.
<SYNC Start=2463649 End=2469362><P Class=ZHCC>
But you'll never get away with your filthy,<br>murdering plans, Mr Colonel Marlowe.
<SYNC Start=2469488 End=2473532><P Class=ZHCC>
You Yankees and your holy principle<br>about saving the Union.
<SYNC Start=2473659 End=2476994><P Class=ZHCC>
You're plundering pirates, that's what.
<SYNC Start=2477120 End=2480414><P Class=ZHCC>
You think there's no Confederate army<br>where you're going?
<SYNC Start=2480540 End=2484752><P Class=ZHCC>
Do you think our boys<br>are asleep down here?

They'll catch up to you<br>and they'll cut you to pieces,

you nameless, fatherless scum!
<SYNC Start=2491968><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

If I give you back your clothes,<br>will you promise not to run away again?

I would, ma'am. There's a point<br>where pride becomes impractical.

I'm sorry you had to break your word.

I gave my word not to run away. I didn't<br>give it not to cry out for assistance.

I suppose there's a fine point there,

I do that, here and now.

Or I suppose when I testify against you,<br>I'd be handicapped with a broken jaw.

One word from you of any kind<br>and he will be shot. Understand?
<SYNC Start=3256259 End=3258510><P Class=ZHCC>
That's right, Cap.
<SYNC Start=3258510><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

Not no more.<br>Now, the Alabama Sixth, it was there.

But it moved to Vicksburg<br>with the Georgia Tenth.

Well, your sense of justice<br>does surprise me a little.

Justice? Those men would<br>have been excess baggage.

Cotton. Railway equipment.<br>Contraband, ma'am.

What is the contraband in the warehouses<br>and on those cars in the sidings?
<SYNC Start=3621645 End=3626357><P Class=ZHCC>
The property of the Confederate States<br>of America is not contraband, sir.

Oh?

Sorry about the arm.<br>When did that happen?

Take him away.

He's West Point. Tough as nails.

He's fighting to save men's lives.

Men's lives?<br>Or the reputation of his profession?

There was a girl not much older<br>than that boy in there.

I wasn't unfair then, understand?
<SYNC Start=4494822 End=4501162><P Class=ZHCC>
Because they used a lot of fancy words<br>that a section hand wouldn't understand.
<SYNC Start=4501288 End=4505416><P Class=ZHCC>
So I held her down<br>while two of 'em worked on her.

I trusted doctors then. Believed in 'em.
<SYNC Start=4509463 End=4513883><P Class=ZHCC>

while they cut away to get in there.
<SYNC Start=4528357 End=4531734><P Class=ZHCC>
And what did they find? Nothing!

Oh, they were sorry.<br>Sure, they'd made a mistake.
<SYNC Start=4536073 End=4539700><P Class=ZHCC>
They had something to talk about<br>before their next experiment.
<SYNC Start=4539827 End=4544038><P Class=ZHCC>
But what about me?<br>They left me begging her not to die.
<SYNC Start=4544164 End=4546207><P Class=ZHCC>
I lost my wife.
<SYNC Start=4546207><P Class=ZHCC>&nbsp;

I didn't kill either one of them.

If I gave you a horse and let you go,

No more promises.

They've got to be quiet.<br>I've given them all the laudanum I have.

It's a lousy finish for good men.
