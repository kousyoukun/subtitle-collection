一个睡在她的床上
A-sleeping in her bed

3

我转过身去对我的真爱

去战斗约翰尼Reb

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,636
我把我的爱一封信
I left my love a letter

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,435
在发牢骚的一棵树
In the holler of a tree

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,196
我告诉她她会找到我
I told her she would find me

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,551
在美国骑兵
In the US Cavalry

00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,875
你好哦,下来他们去
Hi-ho, down they go

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,594
没有这样的词是“不能”
There's no such word as "can't"

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,156
我们将骑清洁降到地狱和背部

- General Hurlburt and Colonel Marlowe. - Steve, come in.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,674
你好,萨姆。上校马洛。
Hello, Sam. Colonel Marlowe.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,272
-谢尔曼将军,上校马洛。-你好吗?
- General Sherman, Colonel Marlowe. - How do you do?

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,358
马洛,我一直渴望见到你。
Marlowe, I've been anxious to meet you.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,353
- 这是一种特权,先生。-坐下来。
- It's a privilege, sir. - Sit down.

36
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,789
- 这是你第一次看维克斯堡吗?-是的,先生。
- Is this your first look at Vicksburg? - Yes, sir.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,914
我们一直在寻找这十个月,我们不喜欢它。
We've been looking at it for ten months, and we don't like it.

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,068
上校,为了你的利益,战争在我们这边还没有顺利在所有。
Colonel, for your benefit, the war on our side hasn't been going well at all.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,149
不是在华盛顿,不是在报纸上,而不是在现场。
Not in Washington, not in the newspapers, not in the field.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,034
说得好听点,以更少的男性和更少的资源,
To put it mildly, with less men and less resources,

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,197
南有鞭打我们陷入停滞状态。
the South has whipped us to a standstill.

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,878
现在,如果我能把维克斯堡……
Now, if I could take Vicksburg...

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,235
整个画面就会改变,但我必须做这个夏天。
the whole picture would change, but I'd have to do it this summer.

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,510
或坐在这里一。
Or sit out here another year.

45
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,156
这可能会花费我们100000人。它可能会花费我们一个战争。
Which might cost us 100,000 men. It might cost us a war.

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,435
这让这跟他们的主要供应来源,和一根荆棘在我们这边。
Which brings this talk to their main source of supply - and a thorn in our side.

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,516
- 牛顿站。- 山姆。
- Newton Station. - Sam.

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,792
马洛工作的细节,你的计划很彻底。
Marlowe has worked out the details of your plan pretty thoroughly.

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,357
如果我能回到洛杉矶田庄马上,我们可以离开到周四。
If I could get back to La Grange right away, we could leave by Thursday.

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,236
好的。你的人是谁?
Good. Who would your people be?

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,592
我自己的第一个伊利诺斯州与西科德的第一和第二爱荷华州密歇根。
My own First Illinois with Secord's First Michigan and Second Iowa.

52
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,836
我们会挑选到一个短旅。
We'd be culled down to a short brigade.

53
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,988
横在La田庄,穿过雷普利,新奥尔巴尼,休斯顿……
Cross at La Grange, down through Ripley, New Albany, Houston...

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,636
- 有什么错了,先生?- 我知道地图。继续进行。
- Is there something wrong, sir? - I know the map. Proceed.

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,197
无论如何,主要的技巧是没有战斗直到我们打牛顿站。
Anyway, the main trick is no fighting until we hit Newton Station.

56
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,629
你多少跟踪图摧毁?
How much track do you figure to destroy?

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,436
尽我所能。至少足以让他们忙碌的几个月。
As much as I can. At least enough to keep them busy for a couple of months.

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,838
否则,突袭将只是一匹马骑。
Otherwise, the raid would just be another horse ride.

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,479
好了,上校,去吧。所有的rails、领带、建筑、桥梁、车辆。
All right, Colonel, go ahead. All the rails, ties, buildings, bridges, rolling stock.

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,558
山姆,即使他应该得到通过牛顿站,
Sam, even if he should get through to Newton Station,

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,638
他会300英里死点在邦联。
he'd be 300 miles dead centre in the Confederacy.

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,513
- 你认为你会怎么回来的?- 有你,先生?
- Have you thought how you'd get back? - Have you, sir?

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,276
嗯,我想我问的。
Well, I guess I asked for that.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,915
但是我讨厌想起你坐在在安德森威尔监狱。
But I hate to think of you sitting it out in Andersonville Prison.

65
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,919
- 这是一个藏污纳垢之处。- 我想那两次,太,先生。
- It's a hellhole. - I'd think about that twice, too, sir.

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,990
嗯,上校,你的成功。
Well, Colonel, your success.

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,512
在洛杉矶的联邦骑兵得宝田庄,田纳西州
THE UNION CAVALRY DEPOT AT LA GRANGE, TENNESSEE

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,675
好吧,这是洛杉矶田庄。
All right, here is La Grange.

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,116
- 我们将每天35英里,平均。- 35吗?
- We will make 35 miles a day, average. - 35?

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,879
35吗?那不是一点夸大它吗?
35? Isn't that stretching it a bit?

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,675
这将是第一天,内德。我打算让这个距离的两倍。
It will be the first day, Ned. I intend to make twice that distance.

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,758
在这样的军事行动,一切都是拉伸。
In an operation like this, everything is stretched.

73
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,836
现在,只是等我几分钟,约翰。
Now, just hold on a minute, John.

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,838
切割男子口粮从五天到三…
Cutting the men's rations from five days to three...

75
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,317
他们必须靠土地最终。他们也要去适应它。
They'll have to live off the land eventually. They might as well get used to it.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,389
他们似乎兴奋。有一个谣言他们前往纳什维尔和游行。
They seem excited. There's a rumour they're headed for Nashville and a parade.

77
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,274
这是一个好的谣言传播,借助军士长。
That was a good rumour to spread, with the help of the Sergeant Major.

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,358
- 谢谢你,先生。-和,先生们,
- Thank you, sir. - And, gentlemen,

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,631
我得承认,他们也把我给骗了。
I'll have to admit they had me fooled too.

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,675
你看,我要用我的离开去做一个小的竞选回家。
You see, I was going to use my leave to do a little electioneering back home.

81
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,190
你知道,摇几手,吻几婴儿。
You know, shake a few hands, kiss a few babies.

82
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,278
你看,我这个秋季竞选国会议员。
You see, I'm running for Congress this fall.

83
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,154
嗯,有30000票在安德森威尔,菲尔。
Well, there's 30,000 votes at Andersonville, Phil.

84
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,352
我希望你不要让任何的动摇他们的手。
I hope you don't get to shake any of their hands.

85
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,271
叶子被取消,订单reshoe整个枯萎的套装,
Leaves are being cancelled, orders to reshoe the whole blasted outfit,

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,675
和他们中的一些人甚至还不是闪亮的鞋子。
and some of them shoes ain't even shiny yet.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,392
是的。
Yep.

88
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,834
我想知道发生什么了。他们一直坐在那棵树下所有的早晨。
I'm trying to figure out what's up. They've been sitting under that tree all morning.

89
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,114
我听到一些谣言对我们被拿出一大游行北上。
I heard some scuttlebutt about us being pulled out for a big parade up North.

90
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,074
-我想我们前往纳什维尔。- 这是我喜欢的。
- I figure we're heading for Nashville. - That's to my liking.

91
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,273
游行,然后离开。现在这场战争开始成形。
A parade, and then leave. Now this war is starting to shape up.

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,229
- 的军官的会议吗?- 在那棵树下那边的,先生。
- Where's the officers' conference? - Over under that tree yonder, sir.

93
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,316
谢谢你！
Thank you.

94
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,518
- 我的道歉迟到了。- 理解。
- My apologies for being late. - Understood.

95
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,916
- 坐下来,大。-我不认为我知道主要的。
- Sit down, Major. - I don't believe I know the Major.

96
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,350
我很抱歉。上校马洛,主要的假象。
I'm sorry. Colonel Marlowe, Major Kendall.

97
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,232
-你好吗?-很高兴认识你。
- How do you do? - Glad to know you.

98
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,399
主要的肯德尔刚刚被分配到我们格兰特将军。
Major Kendall has just been assigned to us by General Grant.

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,911
主要的好像出均匀。你的随身武器,肯德尔吗?
The Major seems to be out of uniform. Where are your side arms, Kendall?

100
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,150
如果你看看这本书,你将会看到一个外科医生不带他们。
If you look in the book, you'll see a surgeon doesn't carry them.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,833
外科医生吗?你剪出我们的大炮和我们的马车。没有什么能将我们拖下来。
Surgeon? You cut out our artillery and our wagons. Nothing to slow us down.

102
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,997
和现在你鞍我们医生和医疗单位吗?
And now you saddle us with a doctor and a medical unit?

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,351
法规,约翰。肯德尔一路走来。
Regulations, John. Kendall goes along.

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,550
很好,先生。有什么问题吗?
Very well, sir. Any questions?

105
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,150
- 我只能说我很高兴对于一些行动。- 没有荣耀狩猎。
- All I can say is I'm glad for some action. - No glory hunting.

106
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,956
如果任何敲门这体无完肤,这将是一个交火。是吗,先生?
If anything knocks this into a cocked hat, it'll be a firefight. Is that all, sir?

107
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,039
-洛根,是布雷迪准备好了吗?- 哦,一张照片。
- Logan, is Brady ready? - Oh, a photograph.

108
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,789
移开。搬回去。
Move away. Move back.

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,559
你准备好我们,布雷迪吗?
Are you ready for us, Brady?

110
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,869
上校。坐下来,上校。
Colonel. Sit down, Colonel.

111
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,115
,非常感谢你。- 没关系。
- Thank you very much. - That's all right.

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,199
- 坐下来,马洛。- 没有帽子,请,先生们。
- Sit down, Marlowe. - No hats, please, gentlemen.

113
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,796
这是正确的。好和放松。
That's right. Nice and relaxed.

114
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,754
现在,玫瑰是红色的,紫罗兰是蓝色的,相机的直视你。
Now, roses are red, violets are blue, the camera's looking straight at you.

115
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,236
哦,我必须有另一个。那个男人在穿白大衣的感动。
Oh, I must have another one. That man in the white coat moved.

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,069
这不是所有他会动不久。一般,就这些吗?
That isn't all he'll be moving before long. General, is that all?

117
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,670
这就是,先生们。谢谢你,布雷迪。
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you, Brady.

118
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,156
谢谢你,一般。非常感谢你。
Thank you, General. Thank you very much.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,956
坐下来。
Sit down.

120
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,868
上校,我想你不开心我的进展。
Colonel, I gather you're not too happy about my going along.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,753
我没想到在你,这是所有。
I hadn't counted on you, that's all.

122
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,476
我能理解你的原因是试图避免战斗,从战术上来说。
I can understand your reasons for trying to avoid a fight, tactically speaking.

123
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,592
但是你要很深入敌军领地。
But you're going very deep into enemy territory.

124
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,792
告诉我,你打算做什么对你的伤吗?
Tell me, what did you intend to do about your wounded?

125
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,639
我打算搬家,和快速行动。
I intend to move, and move fast.

126
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,833
那些太严重上升进行将留给了敌人的仁慈。
Those too badly shot up to carry on will be left to the clemency of the enemy.

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,392
- 民用或军用。- 包括你自己吗?
- Civilian or military. - Including yourself?

128
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,476
自然。
Naturally.

129
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,428
这是一个非常原始的态度。从医学上说。
That's a pretty primitive attitude. Medically speaking.

130
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,997
嗯,医生,战争并不是一个文明的业务。
Well, Doctor, war isn't exactly a civilised business.

131
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,478
当然,我意识到它给你伙计们更广领域的机会……
Of course, I realise that it gives you fellas a wider field of opportunity...

132
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,751
- 实验,上校?- 我没说。
- For experimenting, Colonel? - I didn't say that.

133
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,552

135
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,111
检查每一个人。
Examine every man.

136
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,553
扔掉任何男人- 在你不成问题的意见,当然,是不适宜的。
Throw out any man who - in your unchallenged opinion, of course - is unfit.

137
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,151
即使是那些可能生病一个星期从今天。
Even those who might get sick a week from today.

138
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,999
看,我不要求分配给这个任务。
Look, I didn't ask to be assigned to this mission.

139
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,079
我是一名军医。我被命令去,我要去做我的工作。
I'm a military doctor. I've been ordered to go and I'm going to do my job.

140
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,350
所以我罗嗦。
So get off my back.

141
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,669
-喇叭手!-是的,先生?

- 让我米切尔。- 军士长米切尔在医院。
- Get me Mitchell. - Sergeant Major Mitchell's in the hospital.

143
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,828
- 你多大了?- 32,先生。
- How old are you? - 32, sir.

144
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,509
加入这个群体。
Join that group.

145
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,870
挂在,儿子。我们开始吧。
Hang on, son. Here we go.

146
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,674
这将伤害更糟。
This is going to hurt worse.

147
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,631
那里。他会好的。
There. He'll be all right.

148
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,155
- 我有你生病的列表,假象。- 好的。我很高兴这是一个短的。
- I got your sick list, Kendall. - Good. I'm glad it's a short one.

149
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,032
我们会让水满出来。
We'll let that drain full out.

150
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,913
- 我赞成了,医生。- 小家伙很沸腾。
- I approve of that, Doctor. - The lad had quite a boil.

151
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,157
我没有来这里看你雕刻人的后面。
I didn't come here to watch you carving anybody's behind.

152
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,432
- 为什么是米切尔的名字在这个列表吗?- 先生,我们观察到在这里安静。
- Why's Mitchell's name on that list? - Sir, we observe quiet here.

153
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,949
- 这是什么?- 吸毒成瘾者,这是上校马洛。
- What's this? - Hoppy, this is Colonel Marlowe.

- 我需要米切尔。他的强壮如牛。- 让我看什么。
- I need Mitchell. He's strong as a bull. - Let me show you something.

157
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,992
上校,我一直试图告诉医生,这是没有什么不寻常的。
Colonel, I've been trying to tell the doctor that this is nothing unusual.

158
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,475
不是因为一个男人与疟疾。
Not for a man with malaria.

159
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,239
没有什么新的,假象。
There's nothing new about this, Kendall.

160
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,591
我看见他骑在一天40英里,瑟瑟发抖。
I've seen him ride 40 miles in one day, shivering.

161
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,871
- 他总是疟疾。- 所以你赞成我的诊断。
- He always gets malaria. - So you concur in my diagnosis.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,230
米奇,离开床。我有一些威士忌。
Mitch, get out of bed. I got some whiskey.

163
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,396
你们呆在原地,警官。
You stay where you are, Sergeant.

164
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,117
我被要求脱值勤表任何一个男人,在我看来是不适宜的。
I was ordered to take off the duty roster any man who in my opinion was unfit.

165
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,471
他生病了,他要呆在这里。那些是我的订单。
He's sick and he's going to stay here. Those are my orders.

166
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,956
你已经读了整本书,你没有吗?
You've read the whole book, haven't you?

167
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,033
哦,上校!
Oh, Colonel!

168
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,833
我们得到那小伙子与所有这些对你的条纹。

- Sergeant Kirby reporting, sir. - Well, Kirby.

171
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,913
除了喝醉了,有什么让你愤怒吗?
Besides being drunk, what's got you riled up?

172
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,349
他们让我在城里。把我拉下了火车。

他们告诉我你是好的。你最好是。

欢迎你到…先生。

与我纠缠,我要你的隐藏。

I left my love My love I left, a-sleeping in her bed

I turned my back on my true love Went fighting Johnny Reb

191
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,799

I left my love a letter in the holler of a tree...

192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,833

Hi-ho, down they go There's no such word as "can't"

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,952
我们将骑清洁降到地狱和回尤利西斯・辛普森格兰特
We'll ride clean down to hell and back for Ulysses Simpson Grant

195
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,519
我把我的爱一封信在叫喊的一棵树
I left my love a letter in the holler of a tree

在美国骑兵

一个睡在她的床上

203
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,356
在这里等待一分钟。

204
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,632
- 太阳,它提出了在东每次吗?- 它肯定是在密苏里州。
- The sun, it raises in the east every time? - It sure does in Missouri.

For eight hours, with no turning, we've been heading this way.

206
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,437
如果太阳在东方提出,什么方向?
If the sun raises in the east, what direction is that?

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,269
- 这不是北。- 当然不是。这是南。
- It ain't north. - Course not. It's south.

208
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,154
我们已经骑不偏不倚的篮板球的领土。
We've been riding smack-dab into reb territory.

209

发送你的球探。

你去叫一个暂停,或让他们的敌人的仁慈?

212
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,674
声音回忆。
Sound recall.

213
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,994
只是一个巡逻,先生。没有迹象表明任何主要的力量,只要我可以告诉。
Just a patrol, sir. No sign of any major force, as far as I could tell.

214
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,429
事实上我们已经发现了。
The fact remains we've been spotted.

215
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,556
这个词现在已经确定。他们会回来这里一切可用的。
The word's out for sure now. They'll be back here with everything available.

216
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,353
好吧,内德,你可以准备回头。
All right, Ned, you can prepare to turn back.

217
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,631
这是一个很严重的错误,约翰,把力。
That's a bad mistake, John, splitting the force.

218
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,196

Now you need every man you've got. Diversion be damned.

- 他们必须想我们都退后。- 哦,当然,当然。
- They've got to think we all turned back. - Oh, sure, sure.

220
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,198
但从现在起,每个约翰尼Reb用枪将隐藏在树后面
But from now on, every Johnny Reb with a gun will be hiding behind a tree

221
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,276
想让自己出名。
trying to make a name for himself.

222
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,949
和你想减少力的三分之一!约翰,听我说。
And you want to cut your force by one third! John, listen to me.

223
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,631
有一个古老的公理在政治:你永远不会把你的选票……
There's an old axiom in politics: You never split your ballot...

224
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,958
理查德,当马是浇水和男人是美联储,我们就搬出去。
Richard, when the horses are watered and the men are fed, we'll move out.

225
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,959
嘿,医生。
Hey, Doctor.

226
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,756
这些孩子们说这里有什么违禁品错在那个小屋。
These here contraband children say there's something wrong at that cabin.

227
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,518
我想他们需要一个医生。
I guess they need a doctor.

228
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,316
所有的权利。
All right.

229
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,309
- 你是医生吗?- 是的,我是。

230
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,597
发生了什么事?
What happened?

231
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,235
这是Rainey先生,先生。雷尼第一。他死了。
It's Rainey, sir. Rainey the first. He's dead.

232
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,156
继续。
Carry on.

233
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,753
那里的假象?
Where's Kendall?

234
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,431
肯德尔博士走过去,一些轻的有色人种的小木屋。
Dr Kendall went over to that cabin with some young coloured people.

235
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,994
- 紧急,我相信。- 他什么? !
- An emergency, I believe. - He what?!

236
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,955
他走过去,一些轻的有色人种的小木屋。
He went over to that cabin with some young coloured people.

237
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,556
- 你是医生吗?-什么?不,不。
- Are you the doctor too? - What? No, no.

238
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,837
肯德尔,你在搞什么鬼?
Kendall, what the devil are you doing?

239
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,428
我们只是交付一个婴儿。
We just delivered a baby.

240
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,516
这是一个小女孩。
It's a little girl.

241
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,669
你可以照顾她的现在,奶奶。
You can take care of her now, Granny.

242
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,155
你将会好起来的。
You're going to be all right.

243
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,676
我们有几个受伤的男人,你知道的。
We've got a couple of wounded men out there, you know.

244
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,030
没有,一个人的死亡。
No, one's dead.

245
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,077
一个走了,一个人的出生。
One's gone, one's born.

246
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,873
这是一个神奇的过程,不是吗?
It's an amazing process, isn't it?

247
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,152
多达我已经交付,它总能让我敬畏。
As many as I've delivered, it never fails to awe me.

248
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,512
好吧,孩子,你有一个新妹妹。进去,看看她。
All right, children, you got a new sister. Go in, take a look at her.

249
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,596
好吧,假象。回去照顾你的受伤。
All right, Kendall. Go back and take care of your wounded.

250
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,632
他们会好的。霍普金斯知道要做什么。
They'll be all right. Hopkins knows what to do.

251
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,074
你不是一个国家的外科医生。你是一个军官在联邦军队宣誓。
You're not a country sawbones. You're an officer in the Union Army under oath.

252
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,794
我把一个旧誓言之前。
I took an older oath before that one.

253
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,675
他们似乎并不会有任何麻烦的婴儿在这附近。
They didn't seem to be having any trouble having babies around here before.

254
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,430
我被要求帮助,我无法把它们放下。住口。即使你出生。
I was asked to help and I couldn't turn 'em down. Come off it. Even you were born.

255
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,235
现在,你是在军官的逮捕。
As of now, you are under officer's arrest.

256
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,590
不服从。
Insubordination.

257
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,791
- 我仍然执行我的职责,先生?- 从现在开始限制他们的军队。
- Do I still carry out my duties, sir? - From now on confine them to the troops.

258
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,514
很好,先生。
Very well, sir.

259
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,393
别欺人太甚,假象。
Don't push me too far, Kendall.

260
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,158
前进!
Forward!

261
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,671
Lukey,狗提高如此大惊小怪?
Lukey, what are the dogs raising such a fuss about?

262
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,236
狗吗?你知道狗大惊小怪。
Dogs? You know how dogs make such a fuss.

263
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,918
- 士兵、想念汉娜。很多他们。- 士兵?多么美妙!
- Soldiers, Miss Hannah. Lots of 'em. - Soldiers? How wonderful!

264
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,479
雷声在外屋。他们的洋基队。
Thunder in the outhouse. Them's Yankees.

265
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,273
Lukey,你去楼下并满足他们。
Lukey, you go on downstairs and meet them.

266
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,356
Lukey,你听到了吗?
Lukey, do you hear?

267
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,199
来这里,女孩。
Come here, girl.

268
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,276
来吧。
Come on.

269
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,832
- 谁住在这里?- 汉娜小姐猎人住在这里。
- Who lives here? - Miss Hannah Hunter lives here.

270
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,748
告诉她我想见到她。上校马洛,联盟军队。
Tell her I want to see her. Colonel Marlowe, Union Army.

271
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,269
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

272
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,030
把枪放下。
Put that gun away.

273
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,596
- 对不起,这种入侵,夫人。- 这并不是说,上校。
- Sorry for this intrusion, ma'am. - It isn't that, Colonel.

274
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,353
只是我从来没有准备自己看到统一的围墙内这房子。
It's just that I never prepared myself to see that uniform within the walls of this house.

275
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,552
夫人,我们没有更多的希望在这里比你有我们。
Ma'am, we no more wish to be here than you do to have us.

276
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,638
为什么,那是勇敢地说,上校。
Why, that's gallantly spoken, Colonel.

277
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,880
不管发生什么我们的分歧,我担心我忘记了设施。
No matter what our differences, I fear I'm forgetting the amenities.

278
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,560
- 欢迎来到Greenbriar,先生们。- 谢谢你。
- Welcome to Greenbriar, gentlemen. - Thank you.

279
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,070
Lukey,以君子的帽子。
Lukey, take the gentlemen's hats.

280
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,515
- 军士科比。- 军士。
- Sergeant Kirby. - Sergeant.

281
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,517
太太。
Ma'am.

282
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,792
嗯,我们要让自己更舒服的玫瑰的房间吗?
Well, shall we make ourselves more comfortable in the Rose Room?

283
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,798
不,谢谢你,夫人。我们只呆一会儿。
No, thank you, ma'am. We'll only stay a moment.

284
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,354
你和你的男人骑在吗?
You and your men are riding on?

285
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,075
不,我们将在你的森林里露营过夜。
No, we will bivouac in your woods for the night.

286
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,760
睡在冰冷的地面吗?
Sleeping on the cold, cold ground?

287
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,758
当这是可怕的,浪费的,可怕的斗争正在结束,上校?
When is this awful, wasteful, terrible struggle going to end, Colonel?

288
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,438
哥哥对弟弟……
Brother against brother...

289
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,680
和在我们逗留期间,没有人会被允许离开前提。
And during our stay no one will be allowed to leave the premises.

290
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,030
无论我们是否去,上校?
Wherever would we go, Colonel?

291
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,597
我相信你必须同意这场战争使得对每个人都孤独。
I'm sure you must agree that this war makes loneliness for everyone.

292
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,236
同时,我必须征用大部分的谷物和马,如果您有任何。
Also, I must commandeer most of the grain and horses, if you have any.

293
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,990
你将会支付,小姐猎人,一切事情,在联盟的美元。
You will be paid, Miss Hunter, for everything, in Union greenbacks.

294
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,918
我们不会打扰你了。晚上好。
We will not bother you any longer. Good evening.

295
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,157
- 科比。- 请原谅,夫人。
- Kirby. - By your leave, ma'am.

296
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,195
汉娜猎人,怎么抓住你,说话像一个字段的手吗?你呼叫,我们无存。
Hannah Hunter, what's got hold of you, talking like a field hand? You alls, we alls.

297
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,197
洋基队!
Yankees!

298
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,915
这是不可思议的,上校。
It's uncanny, Colonel.

299
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,271
我听说过他们,但我不相信它。
I've heard about 'em, but I didn't believe it.

300
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,473
我收到我的佣金从密歇根州州长!
I received my commission from the Governor of Michigan!

301
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,160
- 轻人……- 你有什么问题吗?
- Young man... - What's your question?

302
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,114
问题是这个男人的权威在他现在的位置。
The question is this man's authority in his present position.

303
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,835
像往常一样,我想现在的生活的严峻现实。
As usual, I am trying to present the grim facts of life.

304
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,679
他不明白,咖啡口味更好
He doesn't understand that coffee tastes better

305
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,679
如果厕所挖下游代替上游。
if the latrines are dug downstream instead of upstream.

306
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,189
你喜欢怎样的咖啡,上校?
How do you like your coffee, Colonel?

307
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,550
- 西科德,你需要…- 原谅。
- Secord, you oughta... - Pardon.

308
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,558
上校!上校马洛!
Colonel! Colonel Marlowe!

309
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,676
我忘记我的礼貌。为什么,我有没有……
I am forgetting my manners. Why, how I ever...

310
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,517
嗯,我不相信我遇到的这些先生们。
Well, I don't believe I've met these gentlemen.

311
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,998
亨特小姐。西科德上校。主要的灰色。主要的假象。
Miss Hunter. Colonel Secord. Major Gray. Major Kendall.

312
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,599
太太。
Ma'am.

313
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,716
我只是如此的仓促。
I'm just so scatterbrained.

314
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,469
可怜的爸爸和妈妈必须翻在我在坟墓里
Poor Papa and Mama must be turning over in their graves at me

315
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,116
没有什么Greenbriar扩展小酒店可以提供。
for not extending what little hospitality Greenbriar can offer.

316
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,437
至少我可以邀请你共进晚餐。
At least I can extend an invitation to you for dinner.

317
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,358
- 不,小姐猎人……我坚持。
- No, Miss Hunter... - I insist.

318
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,438
有三个胖capons,不得不去无论如何。
There's three fat capons that have to go anyhow.

319
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,350
与我们的商店什么粮食被减少了,就像你说的。
What with our store of grain being reduced, like you mentioned.

320
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,790
所以,你看,你带来了它自己,不是吗?
So, you see, you brought it on yourself, didn't you?

321
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,957
对我而言,我将会很高兴…
Speaking for myself, I would be delighted...

322
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,834
很好,谢谢你。热的食物很难拒绝。
Very well, thank you. Hot food is pretty hard to turn down.

323
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,599
灿烂的。现在,我能指望有多少?
Splendid. Now, how many can I count on?

324
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,188
- 将五或六是……?- 不。
- Would five or six be...? - Not at all.

325
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,276
不同凡响的。
Perfectly wonderful.

326
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,118
九点,先生们?
At nine, gentlemen?

327
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,879
- 德上校?- 第一个密歇根,夫人。
- Colonel Secord? - Of the First Michigan, ma'am.

328
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,036
- 主要的灰色?- 夫人。
- Major Gray? - Ma'am.

329
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,355
主要的……肯德尔,不是吗?
Major... Kendall, isn't it?

330
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,438
恐怕我得遗憾,夫人。这不是我的选择,我向你保证。
I'm afraid I'll have to regret, ma'am. It's not of my choice, I assure you.

331
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,915
此刻,我被逮捕。
At the moment, I'm under arrest.

332
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,715
我们都将很高兴接受邀请,小姐猎人。
We will all be glad to accept the invitation, Miss Hunter.

333
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,950
太太?
Ma'am?

334
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,719
你把你的手帕。
You dropped your handkerchief.

335
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,119
- 关心多一点,西科德上校?-不,谢谢你,夫人。
- Care for a little more, Colonel Secord? - No, thank you, ma'am.

336
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,276
上校马洛吗?
Colonel Marlowe?

337
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,994
-不,谢谢你。- 来了,上校。
- No, thank you. - Come now, Colonel.

338
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,070
一个男人与一个像你一样的大框架不能啃掉像个小老山雀。
A man with a big frame like yours can't just nibble away like a little old titmouse.

339
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,953
先生们,请就座。
Gentlemen, please be seated.

340
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,598
现在,什么是你的偏好?腿……或乳房吗?
Now, what was your preference? The leg... or the breast?

341
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,916
我已经很足够的两个,谢谢。
I've had quite enough of both, thank you.

342
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,996
真遗憾。
What a shame.

343
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,189
- 将别人想要一点吗?-不,谢谢你。
- Would anyone else like some more? - No, thank you.

344
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,952
先生们,坐下。我必须警告你太,没有咖啡。
Gentlemen, be seated. I must warn you too, there's no coffee.

345
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,959
和一个甜或任何种类的甜点是不可能的。
And a sweet or a dessert of any kind was just out of the question.

346
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,310
糖的每桶150美元。
Sugar's $150 a barrel.

347
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,150
“但你的公平的话语作过甜如糖,
"And yet your fair discourse hath been as sweet as sugar,

348
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,829
使艰辛和美味的甜蜜。”
making the hard way sweet and delectable."

349
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,550
多么完美地迷人。有点自己的东西吗?
How perfectly charming. A little something of your own?

350
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,114
不,夫人。理查德二世。
No, ma'am. Richard II.

351
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,631
- 在职业上,我是一个演员。- 为什么,多么的迷人!
- By profession, I'm an actor. - Why, how fascinating!

352
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,754
为什么,你的雪茄主要肯德尔。先生们,请就座。
Why, Major Kendall, your cigar. Gentlemen, please be seated.

353
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,872
主要的肯德尔医生。和德上校几乎一个国会议员。
Major Kendall a doctor. And Colonel Secord almost a congressman.

354
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,198
和你一个演员。现在所有的军人。
And you an actor. And now all military men.

355
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,470
这样的浪费人才。
Such a waste of talent.

356
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,594
但是,当然,上校马洛,我想象你是一个职业军人。
But, of course, Colonel Marlowe, I imagine that you are a professional soldier.

357
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,554
不,在这之前,我是一个疯狂的铁路工程师。
No, prior to this insanity, I was a railroad engineer.

358
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,957
为什么,怎么激动。
Why, how thrilling.

359
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,393
想能够引导其中的一个巨大的东西,膨化和热气腾腾的。
To think of being able to steer one of those huge things, puffing and steaming.

360
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,751
响,小铃。叮咚!叮咚!
Ringing that little bell. Ding-dong! Ding-dong!

361
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,112
不完全。我的工作是在铁路的建造。
Not quite. My job was in the construction of railroads.

362
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,357
为什么,我的!这样杰出的思想。
Why, my! Such brilliant minds.

363
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,759
可怜的我几乎挤过朗斯特里特的神学院为女士小姐。
Poor little me barely squeezed through Miss Longstreet's Seminary for Ladies.

364
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,350
你是怎样设法记住所有的这些书在大学吗?
How did you ever manage to remember all those books in college?

365
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,191
我没有。我开始开车铁路在10美分一天峰值和发现。
I didn't. I started driving rail spikes at ten cents a day and found.

366
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,834
现在,我必须要问小姐猎人,你离开我们。
And now, Miss Hunter, I must ask you to leave us.

367
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,431
我们正在使用这个房间的特权一两个小时。如果我们可以。
We are taking the privilege of using this room for an hour or two. If we may.

368
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,156
当然,但你不喜欢使用另一个房间吗?这项研究,也许?
Of course, but wouldn't you prefer using another room? The study, perhaps?

369
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,989
我们这里很舒服。
We're quite comfortable here.

370
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,078
我很抱歉,但是我必须粗鲁和解释。
I'm sorry but I must be rude and explain.

371
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,239
和我必须在Lukey字段在早上5。
Lukey and I must be in the fields by five in the morning.

372
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,591
先生们,继续照亮你的雪茄。
Gentlemen, go ahead and light your cigars.

373
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,870
- 请允许我。- 谢谢你。
- Allow me. - Thank you kindly.

374
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,390
这一切和盘子之前必须完成她能上床睡觉。
All this and the dishes must be done before she can get to bed.

375
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,149
-我是不是太不体谅吗?- 当然不,夫人。
- Am I being too inconsiderate? - Of course not, ma'am.

376
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,397
- 我可以吗?- 当然。这样,先生们。
- May I? - Of course. This way, gentlemen.

377
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,069
多么美妙。
How wonderful.

378
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,674
真的,我认为这是一个迷人的晚餐。
Really, I thought it was a charming dinner.

379
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,319
- 把这房间。-是的,先生。
- Post this room. - Yes, sir.

380
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,275
- 我希望你能舒适的在这里。-哦,是的。这是好。
- I hope you'll be comfortable here. - Oh, yes. This is fine.

381
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,670
- 如果你想生火,它准备好了。- 不,它很好。
- If you wish to light a fire, it's ready. - No, it's fine.

382
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,078
- 一些白兰地。我要把它Lukey。-不,谢谢你,没有白兰地。
- Some brandy. I'll have Lukey bring it. - No, thank you, no brandy.

383
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,839
你确定这里没有更多的我可以…
Are you sure there's nothing more that I can...

384
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,393
哦,是的。
Oh, yes.

385
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,114
医生,没有必要为你加入这个。
Doctor, there's no need for you to be a part of this.

386
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,155
也许会给你一些小姐猎人Greenbriar为主。
Perhaps Miss Hunter would show you some of the beauties of Greenbriar.

387
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,671
- 为什么,当然,如果他有任何兴趣……- 他会很高兴。
- Why, of course, if he has any interest... - He'd be pleased to.

388
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,553
很好。那么,来吧,医生。
Very well. Come, then, Doctor.

389
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,957
我注意到一个漂亮的花园。我们去散步吗?
I noticed a lovely garden. Shall we take a stroll?

390
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,352
为什么,当然。
Why, of course.

391
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,075
你知道,你先生们必须舒服的沉重的制服,
You know, you gentlemen must be comfortable in your heavy uniforms,

392
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,751
但是我觉得一个明确的寒意在空气中- 这是我和我的薄血。
but I feel a definite chill in the air - it's me and my thin blood.

393
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,599
对不起,我去请个披肩吗?
Would you excuse me while I go and fetch a shawl?

394
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,950
亨特小姐。- 是的,专业?
- Miss Hunter. - Yes, Major?

395
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,755
恐怕我要和你一起去。
I'm afraid I'll have to go with you.

396
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,235
搬到楼上去吗?和我在一起吗?
Upstairs? With me?

397
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,715
- 为什么,专业!- 你只能得到一个披肩。
- Why, Major! - You're only getting a shawl.

398
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,912
当然,但是在这些地区,真是前所未闻的……
Of course, but in these parts it's unheard of...

399
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,474
这是告诉你的孙子。
It's something to tell your grandchildren.

400
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,309
这是战争。目前,Greenbriar是一个军事设施。
This is war. At the moment, Greenbriar is a military installation.

401
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,036
我不认为有任何真正的伤害,是,你是一个医生。
I don't suppose there's any real harm, being that you're a doctor.

402
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,116
这是正确的。
That's right.

403
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,516
Lukey,带一些白兰地,我的客厅,请。
Lukey, bring some brandy to my sitting room, please.

404
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,153
- 我希望你能舒适的在这里,主要的。- 谢谢你。
- I hope you'll be comfortable here, Major. - Thank you.

405
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,436
谢谢你！
Thank you.

406
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,630
嘿!你要去哪里吗?
Hey! Where are you going with that?

407
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,469
- 汉娜小姐要求这白兰地。- 我知道,为主要的。
- Miss Hannah asked for this brandy. - I know, for the Major.

408
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,071
我们从来没有给我们任何一个一流的官员一个未标记的瓶子,
We never give any of our top-ranking officers an unlabelled bottle,

409
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,953
除非有人品味它第一。
unless somebody tastes it first.

410
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,799
- 这是你吗?测试的事情吗?- 当然。
- Is this what you does? Test things? - Certainly.

411
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,436
看到第二条?这意味着我正式为专业品酒师上。
See that second stripe? That means I'm official taster for majors on up.

412
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,150
这里是洛杉矶田庄。
Here's La Grange.

413
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,354
我们已经下到这里大约80英里。
We've come down here approximately 80 miles.

414
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,838
- 我们正走向牛顿站。- 任何字在敌人的力量吗?
- We're headed for Newton Station. - Any word on the enemy strength there?

415
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,272
不,不是一个词。不管它是什么,我们不得不把它。
No, not a word. Whatever it is, we're obliged to take it on.

416
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,359
- 好的。也许我们会看到行动。- 这不是角色扮演游戏。
- Good. Maybe we'll see action. - This is not play-acting.

417
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,600
- 这是你的白兰地,先生。-哦,谢谢。
- Here's your brandy, sir. - Oh, thank you.

418
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,269
- 这是所有测试。- 测试?
- It's all tested. - Tested?

419
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,837
楼下的人,与那些试验机的条纹,因为专业上。
By the man downstairs with those tester's stripes, for majors on up.

420
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,713
哦,是的。中士科比。
Oh, yes. Sergeant Kirby.

421
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,072
- 他真的测试它,不是吗?-是的,先生。两次。
- He really tested it, didn't he? - Yes, sir. Twice.

422
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,430
- Lukey吗? - 是的,想念汉娜。
- Lukey? - Yes, Miss Hannah.

423
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,996
对不起,先生。
Excuse me, sir.

424
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,676
…非常幸运。
... very lucky.

425
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:24,672
这是下一个信息。我们不会回到洛杉矶田庄。
That is the next piece of information. We're not going back to La Grange.

426
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,475
- 我们什么?- 我们不回去北。
- We're what? - We're not going back north.

427
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,472
我们向南到巴吞鲁日加入了工会力量。
We're heading south to Baton Rouge to join up with the Union forces there.

428
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,355
- 伟大的斯科特,你什么时候决定?- 这是最好的方式。这是唯一的方法。
- Great Scott, when did you decide that? - It's the best way. It's the only way.

429
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,157
约翰,这是300英里从牛顿站到巴吞鲁日。
John, it is 300 miles from Newton Station to Baton Rouge.

430
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,239
和它是300英里从牛顿站到洛杉矶田庄。
And it is 300 miles from Newton Station to La Grange.

431
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,514
只有个篮板真的会一直在我们身后关闭,准备咀嚼我们位。
Only the rebs will really have been closed in behind us, ready to chew us to bits.

432
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,712
所以我们就出去他们至少期望:直南。
So we'll go out the way they least expect: Straight south.

433
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,039
该死的,这是自杀。有可能你的订单可能会被误解?
Damn it, it's suicide. Is it possible your orders could have been misinterpreted?

434
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,116
我唯一的责任后牛顿站
My only duty after Newton Station

435
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,835
是获取尽可能多的这些人我能活着回来。
is to get as many of these men back alive as I can.

436
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,588
所以我仍然必须抗议。
And so I still must protest.

437
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,757
更重要的是,我要在记录一般赫尔伯特。
What's more, I want that on the record for General Hurlburt.

438
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,110
这是冲动的集体自杀。
It is impetuous mass suicide.

439
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,800
它在记录,但得到这个。
It's on the record, but get this.

440
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,913
除非敌人的动作让你接替我的位置,这也将是。
Unless enemy action allows you to take my place, that's the way it will be.

441
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,510
吹牛顿站从地图上,然后到巴吞鲁日。
Blow Newton Station off the map, then through to Baton Rouge.

442
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,393
不会有变化。你明白吗?
There will be no change. Do you understand?

443
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,556
好吧,你在命令。
All right, you're in command.

444
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,832
现在让我们再复习一下。直通到巴吞鲁日。
Now let's go over it again. Straight through to Baton Rouge.

445
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,951
我们不会回头。
We will not turn back.

446
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,755
对不起,让你久等了。是白兰地满意吗?
Sorry for keeping you waiting. Was the brandy satisfactory?

447
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,510
-优秀的。你不和我一起吗?- 善我,没有。我从来没有触摸的精神。
- Excellent. Won't you join me? - Goodness me, no. I never touch spirits.

448
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,599
我的爸爸告诉我,一个女孩应该保持对她的她的智慧在任何时候。
My papa taught me that a girl ought to keep her wits about her at all times.

449
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,995
你的父亲提出了一个非常聪明的女孩。
Your father raised a very smart girl.

450
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,998
你是甜的。你愿意看到花园吗?
You're being sweet. Would you like to see the garden?

451
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,554
你没有忘记你的披肩吗?
Didn't you forget your shawl?

452
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,436
为什么,Lukey !
Why, Lukey!

453
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,037
现在,,你把这盘Lukey下楼,去做你必须做的事。
Now, Lukey, you take that tray downstairs and go about doing what you have to do.

454
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,439
你知道,我记得我第一次尝试的精神,在州长的球在杰克逊。
You know, I remember the first time I tried spirits, at the Governor's Ball in Jackson.

455
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,714
我的护卫,亚当色鬼比洛克西,好吧,从他给了我一个薄荷朱利酒。
My escort, Adam Lovelace from Biloxi, well, he gave me a mint julep.

456
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,549
你知道,那些色鬼男孩都很帅,但很快,
You know, those Lovelace boys are all very handsome, but fast,

457
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,591
如果你知道我的意思。
if you know what I mean.

458
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,669
如果我能告诉你的想法,继续在我的脑海里,一个冰镇薄荷酒之后……我的!
If I could tell you the thoughts that went on in my mind after that one julep... My!

459
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,190
我宁愿知道的想法在你的头脑去现在。
I'd rather know the thoughts going on in your mind right now.

460
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,915
-肯德尔,存的什么……?- 对不起我们不得不中断。
- Kendall, what in the name of...? - Sorry we have to interrupt.

461
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,315
问他们什么他们认为你的机会
Ask them what they think your chances are

462
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,398
炸毁牛顿站和到达巴吞鲁日。
of blowing up Newton Station and getting to Baton Rouge.

463
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,195
- 你是喝醉了吗?- 不幸的是,没有。
- Are you drunk? - Unfortunately, no.

464
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,117
他们倾听楼上。
They were listening upstairs.

465
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,511
使一个不错的听诊器。
Makes a pretty good stethoscope.

466
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,029
不要感到内疚。我也能及时发现。
Don't feel guilty. I was slow to catch on too.

467
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,957
你在哪里,肯德尔吗?
Where were you, Kendall?

468
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,834
嗯,一个绅士认为前两次窥视女人的卧室,
Well, a gentlemen thinks twice before peeking into a lady's bedroom,

469
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,996
但有时它有回报。
but sometimes it pays off.

470
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,953
看起来像她欺骗了我们俩。
Looks like she's made a fool out of both of us.

471
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,548
叮咚。叮咚。
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

472
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,954
你知道吗,小姐猎人吗?
You know something, Miss Hunter?

473
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,355
你把我一个相当不便。
You have put me to quite an inconvenience.

474
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,914
至少我已经完成了一些东西,先生。
At least I've accomplished something, sir.

475
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,795
我不认为我能接受你的词不讨论这个荣誉与任何人。
I don't suppose I could accept your word of honour not to discuss this with anyone.

476
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,878
- 我不坚持荣誉与任何洋基。- 到底。
- I don't hold to honour with any Yankees. - Exactly.

477
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,833
所以整个密西西比会接到通知。
So the whole state of Mississippi will be alerted.

478
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,838
所以你能建议我应该做什么吗?
So could you possibly suggest what I should do with you?

479
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,669
我注意到她正在在你的神经。现在你的机会向她开枪。
I noticed she was getting on your nerves. Now's your chance to shoot her.

480
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,634
- 一个字从你……- 去吧。向我们射击。
- One more word out of you... - Go ahead. Shoot us.

481
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,512
拍摄我们俩。
Shoot both of us.

482
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,112
但是你永远不会摆脱你的肮脏,谋杀计划,上校先生马洛。
But you'll never get away with your filthy, murdering plans, Mr. Colonel Marlowe.

483
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,119
你和你的神圣原则洋储蓄工会。
You Yankees and your holy principle about saving the Union.

484
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,437
你是海盗掠夺,这就是。
You're plundering pirates, that's what.

485
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,711
你认为没有南方联盟军队,你要去哪里吗?
You think there's no Confederate army where you're going?

486
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,879
你认为我们的男孩在这里睡着了?
Do you think our boys are asleep down here?

487
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,039
他们会赶上你和他们会削减你的碎片,
They'll catch up to you and they'll cut you to pieces,

488
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,799
你无名,孤儿人渣!
you nameless, fatherless scum!

489
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,516
我希望我能在那里看到它。
And I wish I could be there to see it.

490
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,076
如果它发生,小姐猎人,你将。
If it happens, Miss Hunter, you will be.

491
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,316
快点。
Hurry it up.

492
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,116
所有的权利。
All right.

493
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,036
你是一个优秀的骑手,小姐猎人。
You're an excellent rider, Miss Hunter.

494
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,756
有趣的国家,不是吗?
Interesting country, isn't it?

495
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,318
我更感兴趣的是,为什么你汪达尔人没收了我的死去的父亲的衣服。
I'm more interested in why you vandals confiscated my dead father's clothes.

496
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,512
嗯,他们为我们的学员。
Well, they're for our cadets.

497
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,676
-童子军。-童子军!
- Scouts. - Scouts!

498
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,791
间谍,你的意思。
Spies, you mean.

499
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,072
这是一个想知道他们不爬行腹部像蛇。
It's a wonder they don't crawl along on their bellies like snakes.

500
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,510
你会发现下面发生了什么间谍。
You'll find out what happens to spies down here.

501
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,394
我个人的经验是有限的,间谍我只知道一个。
My personal experience with spies is limited. I've only known one.

502
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,035
你介意,专业?我更喜欢独自骑。
Do you mind, Major? I prefer to ride alone.

503
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,036
太太。
Ma'am.

504
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,033
想念汉娜!
Miss Hannah!

505
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,439
好吧,前进!哟哦!
All right, forward! Yo-oh!

506
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,794
回线,医生。
Back in line, Doctor.

507
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,832
- 这些女士的抽屉几乎是干的。- 是的。
- These lady's drawers are almost dry. - Yeah.

508
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,711
你不让寒冷的吗?
Aren't you getting chilly?

509
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,354
不要告诉我你是关心我的健康。
Don't tell me you're concerned about my health.

510
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,270
如果我给你回你的衣服,你可以保证不逃走了吗?
If I give you back your clothes, will you promise not to run away again?

511
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,791
我将,夫人。有一种观点是骄傲成为不切实际的。
I would, ma'am. There's a point where pride becomes impractical.

512
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,913
事实上,如果你能得到一个看你自己,我认为你会同意的。
Actually, if you could get a look at yourself, I'd think you'd agree.

513
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,237
很好。我希望保持我的健康。
Very well. I do wish to keep my health.

514
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,591
- 我不会试图逃跑再次。-你的话的荣誉吗?
- I shall not try to run away again. - Your word of honour?

515
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,474
- 我的字的荣誉。- 洋基?
- My word of honour. - To Yankees?

516
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,876
- 洋基。- 你发誓?
- To Yankees. - Cross your heart?

517
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,991
- 我对你的承诺!- 好吧,Lukey。
- I gave you my word! - All right, Lukey.

518
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,032
亨特小姐和她的衣服帮助。
Help Miss Hunter with her clothes.

519
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,869
我很高兴你是明智的。你开始担心我。
I'm glad you're being sensible. You were beginning to worry me.

520
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,549
- 从医学角度。- 谢谢你,医生。
- From a medical standpoint. - Thank you, Doctor.

521
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,279
我希望我能有进一步的援助,但是你有你自己的南部人帮助。
I wish I could be of further assistance, but you Southern people have your own help.

522
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,879
注意!眼睛看前面!
Attention! Eyes front!

523
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,470
个篮板,先生!
Rebs, sir!

524
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,197
跳跃,河岸。一个完整的旅,会很快来临。
Hopping that riverbank. A full brigade, coming fast.

525
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,710
马,脚和火炮,先生。这不是民兵,无论是。
Horse, foot and artillery, sir. It ain't militia, neither.

526
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,717
- 有多远?- 十分钟。
- How far? - Ten minutes.

527
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,674
好吧,离开视线,得到在这些树。
All right, get out of sight, get in those trees.

528
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,396
敌人的巡逻队。带盖和阻塞。
Enemy patrol. Take cover and choke up.

529
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,877
-喇叭手!- 不是号手,你个白痴!手势信号。
- Bugler! - Not bugler, you idiot! Hand signals.

530
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,879
敌人过河。搬出去。保持安静。
Enemy across the river. Move out. Keep it quiet.

531
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,755
他为什么不站出来战斗吗?他有一个完整的旅。
Why doesn't he stand and fight? He's got a full brigade.

532
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,993
好哇!好哇!对于南方的权利,万岁!
Hurrah! Hurrah! For Southern rights, hurrah!

533
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,511
欢呼,为美丽的蓝色旗帜,熊一个明星
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag That bears a single star

534
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,394
好哇!好哇!对于南方的权利,万岁!
Hurrah! Hurrah! For Southern rights, hurrah!

535
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,877
欢呼,为美丽的蓝色旗帜,熊一个明星
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag That bears a single star

536
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,116
- 放轻松。
- Take it easy.

537
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,557
来吧,停止它。
Come on, stop it.

538
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,876
汉娜!
Hannah!

539
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,911
嘿!的帮助!在这里!
Hey! Help! Over here!

540
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,190
哎哟!
Ouch!

541
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,312
让去与那些牙齿!
Let go with those teeth!

542
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,069
- 我有800人。得到了一些水。
- I've got 800 men out there. - Get some water.

543
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,074
似乎所有明确过河。
Looks to be all clear across the river.

544
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,792
嗯…
Well...

545
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,877
有多少男人才能保持一个单身女安静?
How many men does it take to keep one lone female quiet?

546
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,119
上校,犯人想和你谈谈。
Colonel, the prisoner would like a word with you.

547
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,672
是的,小姐猎人吗?
Yes, Miss Hunter?

548
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,758
我在这里不是要抱怨你做了些什么。
I'm not here to complain about what you did.

549
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,429
这是你的责任当你看到它,你做到了。
It was your duty as you saw it, and you did it.

550
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,471
我很抱歉你不得不食言。
I'm sorry you had to break your word.

551
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,388
我给我的字不是为了逃跑。我没有给它不是迫切需要援助。
I gave my word not to run away. I didn't give it not to cry out for assistance.

552
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,829
我想有一个好点,
I suppose there's a fine point there,

553
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,713
但我不得不问你给我你的消息,太。
but I have to ask you to give me your word on that too.

554
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,832
我这样做,在这里和现在。
I do that, here and now.

555
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,193
或者我想当我指证你,我就带着一个破碎的下巴是残疾人。
Or I suppose when I testify against you, I'd be handicapped with a broken jaw.

556
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,675
我这么说。什么,夫人?
I'd say so. Anything else, ma'am?

557
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,271
一个轻微的项目。我忠实的伴侣那里。
One slight item. My constant companions there.

558
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,994
我不知道它是如何在北边,当然,
I don't know how it is up North, of course,

559
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,240
但南方有些时候南方妇女觉得需要隐私。
but down South there are times when Southern women feel the need for privacy.

560
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,196
你们两个。
You two.

561
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,949
我们是尊重。真正的尊重,先生。
We was respectful. Real respectful, sir.

562
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,359
你告诉我们这是好的,只要我们能看到的头顶。
You told us it was all right just as long as we could see the top of her head.

563
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,835
- 你告诉他们吗?- 嗯……
- You told them that? - Well...

564
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,190
然后还有一个项目。
Then there's one more item.

565
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,517
我建议你去看医生。叮咚。叮咚。
I suggest you see a doctor. Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

566
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,158
在那边,谷仓。来吧。
Over there in that barn. Come on.

567
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,597
- 我们是bushwhacked,上校。 - 好吧,烟他们出去。
- We was bushwhacked, Colonel. - All right, smoke 'em out.

568
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,276
保持你的火。
Hold your fire.

569
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,478
嘿,那里!我们结盟,但我们不是敌意。
Hey, there! We're Confederates, but we ain't hostile.

570
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,388
- 诚实的!- 放下武器,快点出来。
- Honest! - Drop your weapons and come on out.

571
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,078
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

572
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,070
未来。
Coming.

573
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,311
嘿,维吉尔,提前来。
Hey, Virgil, come ahead on.

574
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,516
他们的真正bluebellies。
They's real bluebellies.

575
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,596
看着它,上校。
Watch it, Colonel.

576
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,029
就我们两个人,帽。和一个俘虏。
Just the two of us, Cap. And one captive.

577
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,872
你好,帽。杰基乔和我是抱歉,突然掉你的人。
Howdy, Cap. Jackie Jo and me is sorry about popping away at you people.

578
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,753
我们以为你是更多的警长。
We thought you was more sheriff's deputies.

579
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,633
你有什么对抗警长?
What have you got against sheriff's deputies?

580
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,036
- 这是一个好一个,嗯?- 这是一个光滑的一个。
- That's a good one, huh? - That's a slick one.

581
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,913
我们只是爱警长。
We just love sheriff's deputies.

582
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,955
他们脱离邦联,先生。最低的猪饲养。
They're deserters from the Confederacy, sir. The lowest swine bred.

583
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,437
- 我把它你警长?- 队长亨利与其,退休。
- I take it you're the sheriff? - Captain Henry Goodbody, retired.

584
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,630
代理警长的罗瑞拉县。
Acting sheriff of Lorena County.

585
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,876
我正要逮捕这些老鼠……
I was about to apprehend these rats...

586
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,198
但是我们bushwhacked你,你老山羊,不是吗?
But we bushwhacked you, you old goat, didn't we?

587
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,792
我们这样做,杰基乔。但告诉他们关于我们,Goodyo船长。
That we did, Jackie Jo. But tell them about us, Captain Goodyo.

588
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,917
- 你敢碰他了!亨特小姐。
- Don't you dare touch him again! - Miss Hunter.

589
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,194
你!你叫你自己一个人吗?处理这人渣吗?
You! You call yourself a man? Treating with that scum?

590
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,356
亨特小姐,那个人是我们的敌人。
Miss Hunter, that man is our enemy.

591
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,109
一个词从你的任何类型和他将被射杀。明白吗?
One word from you of any kind and he will be shot. Understand?

592
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,390
没错,帽。
That's right, Cap.

593
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,878
- 我可以帮助你,小姐?- 我很能让自己。
- Can I help you, miss? - I'm quite capable of getting on by myself.

594
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,869
看来你需要一个小的注意力。医生!你会看我们的好朋友的耳朵?
Seems you need a little attention. Doctor! Will you look to our good friend's ear?

595
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,393
对不起,我有一个胃弱者。奥蒂斯,看看你能做些什么为我们的新招。
Sorry but I got a weak stomach. Otis, see what you can do for our new recruit.

596
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,400
很难解释一个人,不是吗?
Hard to explain a man, isn't it?

597
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,555
照顾这个男人。
Take care of this man.

598
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,830
枪伤,先生。
Gunshot wound, sir.

599
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,995
噢!你的目标坚持那件事清楚到对方?
Ow! You aim to stick that thing clear through to the other side?

600
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,079
我严重怀疑它会遇到任何阻碍。
I seriously doubt it would have met with any obstruction.

601
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,998
中士,给我几个那些好雪茄。
Sergeant, give me a couple of those good cigars.

602
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,350
噢!嘿!
Ow! Hey!

603
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,314
- 做了伤害你,维吉尔?- 这将使你感觉更好。
- Did it hurt you, Virgil? - This will make you feel better.

604
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,228
我们将有一个谈话,伙计们。你来通过牛顿站?
We'll have a talk, fellas. Did you come through Newton Station?

605
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,397
- 当然做了。- 任何军队吗?
- Sure did. - Any troops there?

606
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,751
不是没有更多的。现在,阿拉巴马州第六,它在那里。
Not no more. Now, the Alabama Sixth, it was there.

607
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,599
但它搬到维克斯堡与乔治亚州第十。
But it moved to Vicksburg with the Georgia Tenth.

608
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,713
- 第十是会让处女座非常喜欢和我的旧衣服。- “是”是正确的。
- The Tenth was Virg and my's old outfit. - "Was" is right.

609
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,037
我想没有任何军队在30或40英里。
I guess there aren't any troops within 30 or 40 miles.

610
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,720
- 60至少。- 你卑鄙的叛徒!
- 60 at least. - You vile traitors!

611
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,957
维克斯堡,你说呢?这就是我们前往。
Vicksburg, you say? That's where we're headed for.

612
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,310
看来我们正在进入一个小战斗。
Looks like we're in for a little fight.

613
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,991
- 谢谢,伙计们。解开警长。- 奢侈地,嗯,会让处女座非常喜欢吗?
- Thanks, fellas. Untie the sheriff. - High on the hog, huh, Virg?

614
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,678
嘿,看起来像你美国佬男孩做所有正确的女人。
Hey, looks like you Yankee boys do all right with the women.

615
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,509
和这是一个非常蓬松的一个你那里。
And that's a pretty towheaded one you've got there.

616
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,471
-嗨。- 你好,小姐。
- Hi. - Howdy, missy.

他是最好的铛射我看过。
He's the best dang shot I ever seen.

得到那散包那里。看它!
Get that bale off there. Watch it!

684

这就是为什么我拿起药。
That's why I took up medicine.

691
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,439
- 看那白痴!- 约翰尼・!乔尼英里!

- Without pain. - Well, it was lucky.

746
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,078
你们俩的。
For both of you.

747
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,317
去吧,肯德尔!忙了一整天!
Go ahead, Kendall! Have a field day!

748
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,749
你什么意思,一整天吗?
What do you mean, field day?

749
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,916
他的努力拯救人的性命。
He's fighting to save men's lives.

750
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,431
人的生活吗?或者他的职业的声誉吗?
Men's lives? Or the reputation of his profession?

751
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,588
- 你不可能是认真的,上校马洛。- 就用你的方式,夫人。
- You can't be serious, Colonel Marlowe. - Have it your way, ma'am.

752
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,475
- 医学是最高贵的……- 当然,崇高的职业,高贵的誓言。
- Medicine is the most noble... - Sure, noble profession, noble oath.

753
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:05,436
灯笼上举行高。所以高他们不会承认他们在琢磨……
Lanterns held on high. So high they won't admit they're groping for...

754
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,199
- 你不公平和…- 不公平?
- You're unfair and... - Unfair?

755
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,154
有一个女孩没有多少龄比那个男孩在那里。
There was a girl not much older than that boy in there.

756
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,352
我不是不公平之后,明白吗?
I wasn't unfair then, understand?

757
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:31,555
因为他们使用了很多华丽的词语,一个部分的手不会理解。
Because they used a lot of fancy words that a section hand wouldn't understand.

758
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,639
所以我把她抱下来而他们工作的两个她。
So I held her down while two of 'em worked on her.

759
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,389
我信任的医生然后。相信他们。
I trusted doctors then. Believed in 'em.

760
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,752
因为我在爱,我不想看到她死。
Because I was in love and I didn't want to see her die.

761
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,795
一个肿瘤,他们说这是。
A tumour, they said it was.

762
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,639
和它必须马上出来。
And it had to come out right away.

763
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,833
所以他们把皮带在她的嘴,她能咬掉她的尖叫声
So they stuck a leather strap in her mouth so she could bite off her screams

764
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,520
虽然他们切掉到那里。
while they cut away to get in there.

765
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,871
和他们发现了什么?没有什么!
And what did they find? Nothing!

766
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,913
哦,抱歉。当然,他们犯了一个错误。
Oh, they were sorry. Sure, they'd made a mistake.

767
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,510
他们谈论的话题,在他们接下来的实验。
They had something to talk about before their next experiment.

768
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,679
可是我呢?他们让我乞求她不要死去。
But what about me? They left me begging her not to die.

769
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,756
我失去了我的妻子。
I lost my wife.

770
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,838
我没有杀不是其中之一。
I didn't kill either one of them.

771
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,509
我一定是疯了,或者太传统。
I must have been crazy, or too conventional.

772
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,435
相当一个演讲。我想我的感觉我的酒。
Quite a speech. I guess I'm feeling my liquor.

773
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,678
哇!
Whoo!

774
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,274
- 谢谢你,医生。- 欢迎你,夫人。
- Thank you, Doctor. - You're welcome, ma'am.

775
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,996
谢谢,汉克。
Thanks, Hank.

776
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,278
-嗯,我们几乎愚弄你。- 几乎。
- Well, we almost fooled you. - Almost.

777
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,875
你永远不会使它,汉克。他们已经接近你。
You'll never make it, Hank. They're already closing in on you.

778
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,959
贝德福德森林是嗅探你的高跟鞋。
Bedford Forest is sniffing at your heels.

779
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,629
你直奔安德森威尔监狱的。
You're headed straight for that prison at Andersonville.

780
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,709
没有什么我们可以做的来帮助你。韩国正在挨饿。
There's nothing we can do to help you there. The South is starving.

781
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,832
乔纳森,我所做的一切都是行医。
Jonathan, all I'm doing is practising medicine.

782
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,633
老ironhead确实所有的思维。
Old ironhead does all the thinking.

783
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,638
他认为事情很好。西点军校吗?
He thinks things pretty good. West Point?

784
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,236
不,部分的手。
No, section hand.

785
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,876
- 苏珊和孩子们是如何?- 他们很好。
- How are Susan and the kids? - They're fine.

786
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,357
在维克斯堡。我希望你很快就会看到他们。
In Vicksburg. I expect you'll be seeing them soon.

787
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,438
不错的尝试,乔纳森。不错的尝试。
Nice try, Jonathan. Nice try.

788
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,875
看到你在维克斯堡,吸毒成瘾者。
See you in Vicksburg, Hoppy.

789
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,599
- 再见,吸毒成瘾者。- 再见,大夫。
- Goodbye, Hoppy. - Goodbye, Doctor.

790
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,678
我想谢谢你所有我学到。
I want to thank you for all I've learned.

791
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,679
我会努力活着回家多达我可以。
I shall endeavour to get home alive as many as I can.

792
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,756
你是一个好男人,吸毒成瘾者。
You're a good man, Hoppy.

793
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,318
这事以后都结束了,如果我们不见面,一定和从医学院毕业了。
After this thing is all over, if we don't meet again, be sure and finish medical school.

794
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,874
我要强调它,先生。
I shall make a point of it, sir.

795
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,473
再见,大夫。,祝你好运。
Goodbye, Doctor. And good luck.

796
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,637
谢谢你,医生,为你所有的帮助。
Thank you, Doctor, for all your help.

797
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:11,434
维克斯堡。他们要去西南到巴吞鲁日。
Vicksburg. They're headed southwest to Baton Rouge.

798
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,120
巴吞鲁日。
Baton Rouge.

799
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,074
这是巴吞鲁日,主要的。跟一般的森林。
It's Baton Rouge, Major. Tell General Forest.

800
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:35,189
是的,你可以。我在调查委员会。我知道能做些什么。
Yes, you can. I'm on the board of inquiry. I know exactly what can be done.

801
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,153
现在,他没有权利,甚至作为一个…
Now, he has no right, even as a...

802
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,030
- 菲尔……- 是的,约翰?
- Phil... - Yes, John?

803
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,672
我很抱歉发生了什么回到牛顿站。
I'm sorry about what happened back at Newton Station.

804

Forget it, John. You were under a strain.

805
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,631
但是自从你提出这个话题……
But since you brought up the subject...

806
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,320
你知道,约翰,我是比你长的人。
You know, John, I'm an older man than you are.

807
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,590
更重要的是,我是一个政治家。
What's more, I'm a politician.

808
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,359
我们已经打翻了牛顿站。
We've knocked over Newton Station.

809
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,994
这是一个光荣的事情在我的…我们的记录。
It's a glorious thing on my... our records.

810
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,669
但现在是时候北上,回到洛杉矶田庄……
But now is the time to head north, back to La Grange...

811
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,190
我们承诺,菲尔,这就是事实。
We're committed, Phil, and that's that.

812
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,118
固执。固执!
Stubborn. Stubborn!

813
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,269
哎哟。
Ouch.

814
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,392
我能有一些酒吞下,医生?
Can I have some of that liquor to swallow, Doc?

815
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,796
你没有一个好足够的借口。这是怎么发生的,Dunker吗?
You haven't got a good enough excuse. How'd this happen, Dunker?

816
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,357
我被砍其中一个电线杆在牛顿回到那里。
I was chopping down one of them telegraph poles back there in Newton.

817
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,598
- 右到我的腿斧反弹。-
- The axe ricocheted right onto my leg. -

818
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,439
- 去逮捕斧头。- 它根本没有什么。
- Go arrest the axe. - It ain't nothing.

819
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,190
没什么,嗯?几乎血液中毒。你很幸运我看到你一瘸一拐的。
Nothing, huh? Almost blood poisoning. You're lucky I saw you limping.

820
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,958
噢,医生……
Aw, Doc...

821
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,312
你将在那里?污垢?
What are you putting on there? Dirt?

822
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:59,912
树苔。普通的绿色模具。它有一些类型的愈合剂,我想象。
Tree moss. Ordinary green mould. It has some sort of healing agent, I imagine.

823
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:04,670
- 你想象?- 我不想象结果,上校。
- You imagine? - I don't imagine the results, Colonel.

824
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,997
这是一个古老的夏延印度治愈。
This is an old Cheyenne Indian cure.

825
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,999
啧啧!夏安族印第安人治愈!
Tsk! Cheyenne Indian cure!

826

绿色模具!树苔!

Lukey !
Lukey!

829
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:39,709
- 因为他们向我开枪,我想念汉娜?- 没关系。

832
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,278
你还好吗,想念汉娜?
Are you all right, Miss Hannah?

833
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,358
我给你带了一个小片断的块的蜡烛。
I brought you a little bitty piece of candle.

谢谢你！
Thank you.

837
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,749
我希望你能…可以在这里休息一下。
I hope you'll... be able to get some rest here.

838
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,079
你必须知道我们如何感觉,夫人,大约Lukey。
You must know how we feel, ma'am, about Lukey.

我对你的歉意……

01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,350
在某些方面,我们的原因……

01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,914
Lukey不是要求那。

843
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,600
我希望我能让你走。
I wish I could let you go.

844
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,556
如果我给你一匹马,让你走,
If I gave you a horse and let you go,

845
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:43,913
你答应我不要告诉任何人我们的计划在接下来的24小时?
would you promise not to tell anybody our plans for the next 24 hours?

846
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,838

It started into itching, sir, so I just yanked her off.

你叫那咖啡吗?
You call that coffee?

我们不能通过它。盐是一样重要的弹药。
We can't pass 'em up. Salt is as valuable as ammunition.

Hi-ho, down we go There ain't no such word as "can't"...

- 怎么了?- 医生的工作在Dunker的腿。
- What's going on? - The doctor's working on Dunker's leg.

871
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,716

I left my love My love I left...

872
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,796
再拉。
Take another pull.

873
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,674
啊,那很好商店酒、Doc。谁打了约翰?
Ah, that's good store liquor, Doc. Who hit John?

874
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,679
- 我要把它脱下来,Dunker。- 你说了什么?
- I've got to take it off, Dunker. - What did you say?

875
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,155
我要把你的腿了。
I've got to take your leg off.

876
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,351
你要什么?
You've got to what?

877
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,837
毒的太过分了。你会死在早上。
The poison's gone too far. You'll be dead by morning.

878
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:20,156
什么可以来的我之后,医生?一条腿吗?我什么能来了吗?
What can come of me after that, Doc? One leg? What can come of me after that?

879
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,395
我将钻机吊索具及留给你最接近的平民关怀。
I'll rig a sling and leave you with the closest civilian care.

880
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,192
平民在乎吗?
Civilian care?

881
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,869
然后是监狱接下来,嗯?安德森威尔?
Then comes prison next, huh? Andersonville?

882
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,468
这是发生在我身上,医生? !
Is that what happens to me, Doc?!

883
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,717
- 很可能。- 是的。
- Quite possibly. - Yeah.

884
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,389
这是一个地狱的一个艰难的选择,一个小伙子必须作出。
That's a hell of a tough choice for a fella to have to make.

885
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,435
- 不是吗?嗯,告诉我。不是吗?- 它必须去掉。
- Ain't it? Well, tell me. Ain't it? - It's got to come off.

886
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,675
所有的权利。
All right.

887
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,836
你只是不停地射击。
You just fire away.

888
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:56,954
但在你开始锯切,你给我一些东西,氯仿。
But before you start sawing, you give me some of that chloroform stuff.

889
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,632
- 你把我,医生。- 我给你我得到了什么。
- You put me out, Doc. - I'll give you what I got.

890
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,436
现在咬人。给我一个手在这里。抱他下来。
Now bite this. Give me a hand here. Hold him down.

891
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,396
上帝……上帝!
God... God!

892
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,994
杰斐逊军事学院
JEFFERSON MILITARY ACADEMY

893
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,358
显然它是列那突袭了牛顿站。
It's obviously the column that raided Newton Station.

894
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,516
维克斯堡,报告只是一个微弱的。
That Vicksburg report was just a faint.

895
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,871
我以为一队骑兵是由于这里。
I thought a brigade of cavalry was due here.

896
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,120
- 他们不会在这里直到今天晚些时候,先生。-你所建议的是最极端的。
- They won't get here till late today, sir. - What you suggest is most extreme.

897
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,471
- 我的长的男孩在这里只有16。- 该死,先生!
- My oldest boy here is only 16. - Damn it, sir!

898
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,751
我请求你的原谅,上校。我的意思是,尊敬的…
I beg your pardon, Colonel. I mean, Reverend...

899
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:04,159
看,我有一个男孩在我的电池这是14,一个男人那是72。这是一场战争,先生。
Look, I've got a boy in my battery that's 14, a man that's 72. This is a war, sir.

900
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:09,479
我可以开始吊在他们生物弹片和葡萄,赶上他们午睡。
I could start lobbing shrapnel and grape at them critters, catch 'em napping.

901
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,118
只是一个展示武力,那么也许我们可以抵御它们直到骑兵找到这里。
Just a show of force, then perhaps we can hold them off until the cavalry gets here.

902
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,231
- 学员主要巴克斯代尔。- 先生?
- Cadet Major Barksdale. - Sir?

903
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,511
组装你的营。整个补充。

把他们从值勤表。嗯,你听到了中尉。
Scratch them from the duty roster. Well, you heard the Lieutenant.

906
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:31,192
你会很高兴通知队我们将在黎明。
You'll be pleased to inform the corps we shall move at dawn.

907

Reverend, my boy Johnny. He's all I've got left.

914
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,316
首先他的爸爸,然后他的叔叔,他的兄弟。现在他吗?
First his pa, then his uncles, his brothers. Now him?

915
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:45,719
他的一切我已经离开,尊敬的。我不会让他走。
He's all I have left, Reverend. I'm not going to let him go.

916
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,912
学员鼓手布福德,你解除责任。
Cadet drummer Buford, you are relieved of duty.

917
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,718
我想节省一点,对于Dunker。

Blood poisoning. Amputation. A shock to the heart, I guess.

922

John, it's a trap. They want us to cross that bridge.

1034

它就像经历一个漏斗。
It'd be like going through a funnel.

1035

在这样的位置,没有什么可耻的关于尊贵的投降。
