00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,516
My brother Metacomet,

2
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,350
may the noble spirit

3
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,630
ofyourfather, Massasoit,

4
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,835
soar with the eagles.

5
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,959
Chief Metacomet.

6
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,070
Thanks to

7
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,192
the friendship of your father,
we have survived here.

8
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,270
My father should have let you

9
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,990
die!

10
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,435
You are

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,319
the only one

12
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,594
who comes to us

13
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,799
with an open heart.

14
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,389
But your people have murdered

15
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,195
my father

16
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,394
with their lies!

17
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,959
My name is Pearl.

18
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,517
This is the story of
my mother, HesterPrynne.

19
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,311
It was the yearofourLord 1666,

20
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,751
when she arrived in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony

21
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,589
filled with the hope that at last,
in this new world

22
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,799
would come the freedom to worship
without fearofpersecution.

23
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,273
My esteemed colleague!

24
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,431
Thy years of toil become thee!

25
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,716
Thy fame preceeds thee, sir.

26
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,830
Governor Bellingham,

27
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,835
may l present

28
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,271
the Reverend Thomas Cheever.

29
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,994
Welcome, sir.
lt's a long voyage.

30
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,191
3 months at sea,

31
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,675
will either take away your faith,
or harden it to iron.

32
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,713
Allow me to introduce a woman
who's been travelling with us,

33
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,951
-Mistress...
-Hester Prynne.

34
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,194
l apologize for the coarseness

35
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,719
of my hands, Mistress.

36
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,150
But here in the colonies,
everyone must work.

37
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,391
l look forward to the hard work.

38
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,229
lt says id Psalm 92: ''l will
triumph in the work of thy hands''.

39
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,995
Thou canst quote the Scriptures.

40
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,077
Aye, Reverendo, both Testaments.
My husband taught me.

41
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,309
You must rest.

42
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,670
Then l'll show you
what's been accomplished.

43
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,710
l thank thee.

44
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,638
-Then it's Goodwife Prynne.
-Yes, yes.

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,517
But l prefer to be called Hester.

46
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,749
Welcome, Hester.

47
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,916
l wish l could've seen it before,

48
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,917
when it was wild and untouched.

49
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,950
Madam,

50
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,195
you should use less lace
in your dressmaking.

51
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,959
lndeed, Reverend.

52
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,473
Master of us all,

53
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,994
we give thanks for
another bountiful meal,

54
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,474
and for newly arrived disciples,

55
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,230
that share it with us this night.

56
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,158
-Amen.
-Amen.

57
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,470
So, Governor.

58
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,070
l am impatient to know
how you fared with Metacomet.

59
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,712
Well, Metacomet
isn't Massassoit, Major Dunsmuir.

60
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,357
But if we respect the agreements
we made with his father,

61
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,669
we've nothing to fear.

62
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,831
So we don't
grow complacent,

63
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,315
our wise God sends us a sign.

64
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,189
When we sailed,

65
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,153
your letters said we were
at peace with the savage.

66
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,430
Well,

67
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,952
l fear the days of ''peace''
with the Wampanoag is at an end.

68
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,356
Major,

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,869
we are frightening
our new arrival.

70
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,071
We hear much

71
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,555
of your success
with the praying lndians.

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,560
l'm very eager to meet
Reverend Dimmesdale

73
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,034
and his converts.

74
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,074
The runts of the litter.

75
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,557
Dimmesdale's little treasures!

76
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,512
Some of us
have other opinions.

77
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,669
Mistress Prynne,

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,309
l hope you'll stay with us

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,158
until your husband's arrival.

80
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,074
You're most kind,
but l intend to find

81
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,952
a house of my own
as soon as possible.

82
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,509
On thine own?

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,876
Why, yes.

84
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,438
lt's not considered fitting
for a young woman to live alone.

85
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,476
l've come first to prepare
a place for his arrival,

86
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,318
so that is what l intend to do.

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,675
Mistress Prynne.

88
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,114
The rules we live by may seem
arbitrary to a newcomer,

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,754
but we have learnt
the hard way

90
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,393
that without absolute order,

91
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,951
we cannot hope to survive here.

92
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,878
Rules, Mistress Prynne.

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,270
Order.

94
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,356
Survival.

95
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,672
Would you have me
disobey my husband?

96
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,236
-l...
-Reverend, you might enjoy

97
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,159
the company of my son, Brewster.

98
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,192
He studied Divinity.

99
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,277
Harvard wasn't good enough
for him,

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,675
so he came home to
make his fortune as a...

101
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,759
Minister's sons all moaning
the Lord's Prayer

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,274
in their sleep.

103
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,878
Everyone must find his place.

104
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,710
-Morning, Mistress Prynne.
-Good morrow.

105
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,397
So you intend on scandalising
the town!

106
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,430
Get up!

107
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,596
Good!

108
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,869
l confess,

109
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,038
l feel alone in a
sea of conformists.

110
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,518
Where should we begin our search?

111
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,637
On the cliffs by the sea.

112
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,558
No, it's out of the question.

113
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,276
Why?

114
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,871
No one's lived
by the sea

115
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,749
since the lndians
wiped out Ballinger's Point.

116
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,792
l say we start there.

117
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,515
Well, if you've decided.

118
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,998
ls that it, Brewster?

119
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,473
lt's beautiful.

120
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,115
I tried to imagine
what herlife was like

121
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,151
before she came
to the new world.

122
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,677
Why did herhusband
send heron ahead,

123
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,270
alone?

124
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,076
Was it a test ofherloyalty,

125
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,514
orherspirit?

126
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,478
Or was it in his nature
to set traps

127
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,353
forpeople in the hope
they would fall into them?

128
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,869
lt's perfect!

129
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,628
With a cart and a musket,
l could have a home here!

130
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,238
A cart, a horse,

131
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,113
a pitchfork, a plow.

132
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,470
l can think of better things

133
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,557
to do with these pretty hands
than grow calluses on them.

134
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,789
l'll need indentured labor,
at least two men.

135
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,237
-The land needs draining.
-You are headstrong.

136
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,312
Perhaps it runs in the blood.

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,070
l'm told your father was too.

138
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,995
ls it true

139
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,310
he was in debt to your husband
and you were the payment?

140
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,951
l've said something
to disturb you.

141
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,350
l'm sorry.

142
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,399
l'm truly sorry.

143
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,470
God, thou art wondrous fair!

144
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,030
That hurt!

145
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,750
Good. lt'll remind you
not to do it again.

146
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,552
Faith?
Prudence?

147
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,712
Did you hear Mistress Prynne
has a bathing tub?

148
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,115
What is she, French?

149
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,595
2 Shillings.
Will you bid 2 shillings?

150
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,472
2 and a half?

151
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,478
Come on, gentlemen,
do l have a bid for 3 shillings?

152
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,193
3 shillings?

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,152
3 shillings?

154
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,191
Anyone else?
Anyone else?

155
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,278
Going for 3 shillings.
Any other bids?

156
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,552
Sold to the gentleman
for 3 shillings.

157
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,751
-Next we have this other one,
-Those two.

158
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,877
How much time left
on their indenture?

159
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,479
About 3 years, but,

160
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,714
shouldn't your husband or father
be doing business with me?

161
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,951
ls my money
no good to you, sir?

162
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,070
Your money's as fine as wine
in the sunshine, Mistress.

163
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,159
lf you buy them at a just price,
l'll throw in the girl in red.

164
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,470
She's a slave!

165
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,831
But she don't speak, if that
be a problem. Born that way.

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,149
Name your just price.

167
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,678
We'd best accompany you
if your going to the forest.

168
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,634
Don't worry Mr Bobbin.
l shan't go far.

169
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,590
Mistress Prynne?
Mistress Prynne?

170
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,835
Mistress Prynne?

171
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,234
Where are you?

172
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,476
Mistress Prynne, where are you?

173
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,992
l found her.

174
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,315
-You did not.
-l did to.

175
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,238
-You did not.
-l did to.

176
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,996
Mistress Prynne,

177
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,713
Have you forgotten
it is the Sabbath?

178
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,832
Of course not.
Forgive me.

179
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,913
We've come by especially
to bring you to church.

180
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,278
Thank you, so much.

181
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,599
Please, go on without me.

182
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,631
l will follow at once.

183
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,915
Make haste.

184
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,196
Yes, sir.

185
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,589
All right, girl,

186
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,270
Come on.

187
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,839
Oh goodnes!

188
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,313
Back up. Back up.

189
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,433
Come on now, back up.

190
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,435
Come on. Come on. Back up.

191
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,110
Good morrow.

192
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,438
May l be of assistance?

193
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,513
Not from up there.

194
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,756
Come on.

195
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,671
Come on.
Steady. Steady.

196
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,436
l can't make this horse
understand me.

197
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,151
Let me try.

198
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,392
Come on, girl.

199
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,119
Come on, back up!

200
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,639
Come on, girl.

201
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,157
Come on. Come on.

202
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,510
l'm afraid you're in too deep.

203
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,439
She'll not make it.
Let me try this.

204
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,550
l do hope you can get it free.

205
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,399
l'm already late for the service,
and everyone's talking about me.

206
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,436
l've been away and l'm quite
behind on local gossip.

207
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,148
l bought the old Newbury place
out on Ballinger's Point.

208
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,755
Then,

209
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,278
l owe you an apology.

210
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,358
l've been trespassing.

211
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,074
There's a place at the point
where l like to bath.

212
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,959
Really? Well, l shan't charge
too steep a tariff.

213
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,075
Come on, girl, back up!

214
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,712
-Back up.
-One,

215
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,276
Two,

216
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,798
Two. Three.

217
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
l'm afraid this cart will be
stuck here until Sabbath next

218
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,074
unless l gather hands to help.

219
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,953
Would you care to ride with me?

220
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,673
On your horse, with you?

221
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,876
Aye, unless you can ride.

222
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,349
l can ride.

223
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,999
You take my horse
and l'll take yours.

224
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,710
There's a shortcut
to the meeting house,

225
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,319
but it's a difficult road.

226
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,752
l shall manage, sir.

227
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,076
-Are you certain?
-Just you lead the way.

228
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,711
Come on! Come on!

229
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,796
Come on! Come on!

230
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,238
May God be with you.

231
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,518
l'm sure he already is.

232
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,071
But aren't you coming to...

233
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,837
Good Sabbath to ye all.

234
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,153
Friends,

235
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,916
and fellow voyagers,

236
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,509
in the greatest of all dreams.

237
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,510
We've been singled out,
like lsrael of old,

238
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,478
to serve as a model.

239
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,715
But if we are to succeed

240
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,793
in building our new Jerusalem,

241
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,754
our ''City on a Hill'',

242
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,150
then the power of love,

243
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,392
yea, His Divine Love,

244
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,160
we must bind our hearts as one!

245
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,354
English and lndian,

246
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,594
gentry and indentured,
free man and slaves,

247
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,751
and make of us

248
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,996
an example for all the world,

249
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,316
to marvel at and proclaim:

250
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,794
''Here...

251
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,598
is the measure of perfection!

252
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,513
Here,

253
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,951
lives God's own!''

254
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,954
But we are not succeeding
in that test.

255
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,714
We are failing!
And why?

256
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,515
Because we covet,
nay,

257
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,551
we lust after
what is not ours.

258
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,675
Be it for the rich land
of our lndian brothers,

259
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,155
be it for glory,

260
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,154
for profits or for revenge.

261
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,595
Need l read the secret

262
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,031
of every heart?

263
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,071
l will if you want.

264
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,794
Yea, l will if you want.

265
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,196
l will lay open the secrets

266
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,994
before the eyes of God!

267
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,358
What thou lusteth after is my enemy,
sayeth the Lord God.

268
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,551
For only l shall consume thee,

269
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,271
only l shall fill thee up.

270
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,232
lf thou failest to heed
my commandments,

271
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,317
then my fist

272
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,398
shall descend on thee
like a stone!

273
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
And thy sword shall cut thee
into bloody parts,

274
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,231
and even thy memories
shall be sacrificed

275
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,715
to the winds
for all time!

276
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,433
May God bless you,

277
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,476
each and every one of you.

278
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,114
Amén.

279
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,590
Amén.

280
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,837
Allow me to present a newcomer
to our congregation,

281
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,268
Mistress Roger Prynne.

282
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,790
Mistress Roger?

283
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,992
Aye, her husband, a renowned
physician will join her before...

284
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,236
Reverednd Dimmesdale and l
have already...

285
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,433
l helped when her cart
got stuck in the woods.

286
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,995
l greatly enjoyed your sermon.

287
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,268
lt's rare for a man so young
to speak with such passion.

288
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,630
For some reason,

289
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,916
l felt most inspired today.

290
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,716
We welcome you and your husband
to our congregation.

291
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,113
Mother! Mother!

292
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,719
There you are, Hester.

293
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,115
Meet my friend, Running Moose.
He's our schoolmaster.

294
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,515
And l'm sure you'd like
some refreshment.

295
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,280
Do you teach the English children
as well Mr Running Moose?

296
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,715
They call me John or Johnny here.

297
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,878
We try our best, but the English
are a bit slow-witted.

298
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,473
Slow-witted?

299
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,877
Johnny's a bit of a jester,
but he was our first praying lndian.

300
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,193
My best friend in the colony.

301
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,149
Arthur,

302
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,353
-this is Mistress...
-We've already met.

303
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,599
Excuse me.

304
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,432
So like home.

305
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,351
Yet beyond those trees
l suspect a savagery,

306
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,551
of savage passions,

307
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,990
dark and untamed.

308
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,838
Reverend Dimmesdale,
have you met our young friend?

309
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,593
Yes, we've met.

310
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,951
Mistress Prynne and l
traveled out on the same ship.

311
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,957
l'm going to marry him one day.

312
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,357
No you're not, l'm going to
aren't l Mistress Prynne?

313
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,757
-Marry whom?
-Reverend Dimmesdale, of course!

314
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,270
''A Short Description of the
Great and Last Judgement''.

315
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,590
Well, ''Platform for
Church Discipline''.

316
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,670
They're all tracts!

317
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,591
''The Goodwife's Manual...''

318
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,829
for Animal Husbandry''

319
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,152
l believe we've already met.

320
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,590
Oh, yes, l...
l'm sorry, l didn't realize.

321
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,637
l should have
announced my presence.

322
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,753
What are you reading?

323
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,554
-''Comus'', it's by John
-John Milton.

324
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,193
l know it. l've read it.

325
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,676
Have you?

326
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,110
l'm not all counterpanes
and coverlets.

327
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,510
Every spare moment, l read.

328
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,392
l'm the same.

329
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,155
l've read every book in this room.
Some of them several times.

330
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,794
Even ''Manual for Animal Husbandry?''

331
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,672
A most exhiliarating read.

332
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,876
So, did you truly
enjoy my sermon?

333
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,594
Yes, it was most skilful.

334
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,030
Clearly your congregation
reverences you.

335
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,869
You liked it not. We don't
come up to London standards.

336
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,392
To the contrary.
l was moved by your passion.

337
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,790
And?

338
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,436
Well,

339
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,710
when your fist struck your hand,

340
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,912
and sliced through the air
like a sword,

341
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,116
l found myself wondering

342
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,229
what manner of pain lay
beneath such forceful oratory.

343
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,112
Your tongue knows no rules,
Mistress Prynne.

344
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,877
And if it did, Reverend,

345
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,638
what purpose would it serve?

346
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,310
And here l thought
comprehending God

347
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,636
was to be my greatest challenge.

348
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,755
Yes, Reverend?

349
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,836
This morning in the forest,

350
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,310
why did you not say
you were married?

351
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,511
Why did you not say
you were a minister?

352
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,236
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

353
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,156
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

354
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,236
Good morrow.

355
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,237
You care for a cup of cider?

356
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,869
We are your neighbours, it seems.

357
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,675
Did you like the sermon
this morning?

358
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,191
From where l sat it
seemed it did please thee.

359
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,951
l liked it very much.

360
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,151
l thought the
young minister very...

361
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,031
Handsome?

362
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,719
Harriet Hibbons.

363
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,949
Ruth?

364
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,194
How do you do?

365
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,670
Come and meet some of
the others who were not invited

366
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,115
to the Governer's shindig.

367
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,470
Sally Short, Mistress Prynne.

368
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,436
How do you do?

369
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,437
l was on the dock
when you arrived.

370
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,993
Mary Rollins.

371
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,072
Mary don't like to speak much.

372
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,392
She's only been free from
the savages this half year.

373
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,195
And Matona don't trust
the English, do you dear?

374
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,398
Mistress Prynne?

375
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,830
Thank you, no.
l never imbibe.

376
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,835
You've gathered some fine
Balm of Gilead,

377
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,792
Shepherd's Purse, yarrow.

378
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,512
You know your plants?

379
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,671
l do. l recite ''Culpepper''
by heart.

380
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,994
Really?

381
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,350
Then what would you use to
heal a bad burn?

382
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,836
l've seen sweet fern work miracles,

383
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,270
but Culpepper suggests blackberry
and red cedar.

384
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,352
Well, you hear that.

385
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,158
My husband has
a very large library

386
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,793
and l was able to school myself.

387
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,678
How do you like our new
Jerusalem?

388
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,552
Sober enough for you?

389
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,115
Aye,

390
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,559
sober enough.

391
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,639
What l miss is the dancing.

392
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,069
Dancing?

393
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,793
When first we came,

394
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,474
they'd be dancing round
the maypole.

395
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,069
Feast days we'd sing
bawdy songs.

396
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,236
People weren't afraid
to play the fool.

397
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,635
We'd teach
the bears to dance.

398
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,355
Now days, everybody getting more
and more sourfaced and ponderous.

399
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,789
And a whipping post stands
where the mayppole used to be.

400
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,069
But there's a few of us who
haven't forgotten to laugh.

401
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,390
lt's been a pleasure
meeting you all.

402
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,591
l'm sorry l must take my leave,

403
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,111
but l don't want to be stuck
in the wilds at night.

404
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,436
There are things that sound to me,

405
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,870
the wilds at night are
my natural territory.

406
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,548
Particulary when there's
a full moon.

407
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,598
Do you try to frighten me
with this witch talk?

408
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,552
Not so, Mistress Prynne.

409
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,073
But l can see
what others cannot.

410
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,956
Be a curse, to be sure,

411
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,194
but l know the hearts of men.

412
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,757
And what does my heart tell you?

413
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,753
You're a most comely woman.

414
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,071
Let a man tremble
who wins the hand of a maid,

415
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,838
but possesses not the
full passion of her heart.

416
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,869
My husband has nothing to fear.

417
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,796
Good day Mistress Hibbons.

418
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,390
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

419
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,632
Good day, Goody Gotwick.

420
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,195
l brought these for
Reverend Dimmesdale.

421
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,868
The Reverend be occupied
with his work, Missus.

422
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,833
Leave them books on the table
and l'll be sure he gets them.

423
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,713
Good morrow, Reverend.

424
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,315
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

425
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,309
Knowing you hunger for new reading,

426
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,636
l brought you some books.

427
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,072
How courteous of you.

428
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,869
Please.

429
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,589
l must apologize for my
forthrightness on Sabbath last.

430
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,550
l've earned a few reprimands
for speaking too bluntly.

431
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,592
l owe an apology, too.

432
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,589
l can't understand why
l took such offence

433
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,593
to such a simple comment.

434
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,072
But l have wondered

435
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,032
how you were able

436
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,159
to see so deeply

437
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,429
into my nature.

438
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,074
Perhaps l'm a witch.

439
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,876
l must be keeping you
from your chores.

440
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,950
Thank you for the books.

441
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,155
Good day.

442
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,636
l'm sorry. My hands
are covered in ink.

443
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,035
l've been

444
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,997
hovered over
my translations all day.

445
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,515
Translations?

446
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,910
Aye. l'm attempting to

447
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,637
translate the Bible into
the local lndian language,

448
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,670
Algonquin.

449
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,191
What an ambitious undertaking.

450
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,958
But l'm told the lndians don't want
to be guided by our Bible.

451
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,832
That war with them is inevitable.

452
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,351
Some think that way,
but they're wrong.

453
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,518
The lndians, born from a
certain liberty,

454
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,551
take not easily
to bridle and bit.

455
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,315
No man should.

456
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,556
Well...

457
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,350
What?

458
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,551
What?

459
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,436
You keep putting ink
on your face.

460
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,356
Oh, l do.

461
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,030
There you are.

462
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,917
l do hope you enjoy
the books.

463
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,998
Thank you.

464
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,230
Good day.

465
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,595
Good day.

466
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:44,996
Mituba?

467
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,149
'Tis only a bathing tub,
not a toy of Satan.

468
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,794
Mistress Prynne?

469
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,469
Reverend Dimmesdale!

470
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,637
-You frightened me.
-l'm sorry. l didn't mean to.

471
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,073
lt's a wonderful surprise.

472
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,277
-lt's beautiful.
-Yes, and frightening.

473
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,552
Just as Eden must have been.

474
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,439
So untouched.

475
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,390
Does it not cry out
with it's promise,

476
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,636
that everything
can begin anew?

477
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,592
l brought back your books.

478
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,511
You couldn't have read them all
in four days.

479
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,439
Oh no, l did.
l read most of them twice.

480
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,716
Thank you.

481
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,229
You're welcome.

482
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,715
Farewell.

483
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,716
Hester...

484
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,192
l'm not the man l seem.

485
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,230
l've lived here all my life,
my purpose clear.

486
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,789
But now l'd risk everything,
my life, my ministry, my soul

487
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,231
just to spend a few
moments alone with you.

488
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,593
God help me, Hester.

489
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,354
l love thee.

490
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,030
God help me.
l love thee too.

491
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,235
Oh God. Have we lost our way?

492
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,110
No!

493
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,870
l dreamed of thee speaking
thy heart.

494
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,478
l have prayed for it even as
l have dreaded it.

495
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,638
Was l alive before
l laid eyes on thee?

496
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,515
What shall we do?

497
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,595
l know not.

498
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,277
Say something to end it,

499
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,279
for l have not the power.

500
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,915
Nor l.

501
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,995
Nay!

502
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,712
We could be hanged for this.

503
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,550
l've put you in too much danger,

504
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,518
and l must end it by walking away
and never speaking with you again.

505
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,355
Go then.

506
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,394
Do as you promised.

507
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,791
Throughout the long summer,
Mistress Prynne and the Reverend

508
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,877
avoided each other
at all costs.

509
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,075
Mistress Prynne rarely went to town
and the Reverend escaped to the wilds

510
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,395
with the Indians

511
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,068
and faithful Johnny Sassamon
forcompany.

512
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,718
And the colony organized

513
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,911
it's annual election day
as usual.

514
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,351
No one the wiser that
there existed among them

515
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,036
two hearts struggling
against a love

516
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,834
that grew stronger with
each passing day.

517
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,714
Johnny Sassamon says they've
attacked the ''lntrepid''.

518
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,557
What's he saying,

519
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,476
Arthur?

520
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,354
The Tarrantines

521
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,354
attacked an English ship,
the lntrepid.

522
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,599
All were massacred.

523
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,430
''Prynne''.

524
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,398
''Doctor Roger Prynne''.

525
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,549
Mistress Prynne.

526
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,752
l'm here as your minister.

527
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,830
Come in.

528
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,712
There was an attack,

529
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,070
an lndian attack on one of our ships.

530
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,238
They say that,

531
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,112
all aboard were massacred.

532
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,233
l regret to be...

533
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,790
the one to bring you
this sad news.

534
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,951
l'll leave you to your mourning.

535
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,395
Are you certain none survived?

536
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,718
They say that the tide
washed away the bodies.

537
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,758
God forgive me!

538
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,829
l've prayed so long to
be set free.

539
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,795
You did not cause his death, Hester.

540
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,596
God...

541
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,275
took your husband.

542
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,948
But was it an answer
to my prayers?

543
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,388
Does He work like that?

544
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,036
Perhaps.

545
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,194
lf in His eyes there was no other way

546
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,391
we could be together.

547
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,552
l must know what the law is.

548
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,554
The mourning, how long must one wait?

549
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,591
1 month? Six months?
What?

550
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,517
Where there is no absolute
proof of death,

551
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,193
7 years must pass before
we're free to be seen in public.

552
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,273
7 years?

553
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,116
Yes...

554
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,315
Greetings, Metacomet.

555
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,232
We have been

556
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,595
enemies.

557
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,189
But now Tarrantine

558
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,234
and Wampanoag must unite

559
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,268
to fight

560
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,118
the greedy English.

561
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,038
before theypush us into

562
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,909
the sea.

563
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,871
Were the lndians
cruel to you, Mary?

564
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,036
After my little one died,

565
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,035
they treated me fair and square.

566
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,633
lf truth be told,

567
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,992
cruel is how you folks have
treated me since l come home.

568
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,030
Thank you.

569
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,513
l didn't do nothing
that wasn't forced on me!

570
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,749
The thought of being
taken by a savage

571
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,152
makes me sick to my stomach.

572
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,470
Well, they do it on
the backs of their horses,

573
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,796
ridin' across the land.

574
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,192
Hester, you all right?

575
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,909
Yes, l'm just tired.

576
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,994
Mary's right.

577
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,877
You call them savages.

578
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,957
l could tell you a thing or two

579
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,913
about your husband
before he tied the knot with you.

580
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,268
Stupid slut!

581
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,628
Harold would never had nothing
to do with no whore!

582
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,919
You think not?

583
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,792
l've even seen
one of your windy ministers

584
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,070
pokin' an lnjun girl,

585
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,838
standin' on a bible
so he could roger her better.

586
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,119
They always said the Scriptures
should uplift you!

587
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,829
l refuse to be with those
who would mock the Holy Book!

588
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,269
Well,

589
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,552
she'll not be coming back soon.

590
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,875
Good riddance to her!

591
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,231
We Quakers believe that
the Scriptures be not religion,

592
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,079
but only the ceremony
and history of it.

593
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,349
l agree.

594
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,277
For are not the laws of men
but the imagination of mortals,

595
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,994
and the inner spirit
the true voice of Heaven?

596
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,036
Hester,

597
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,879
l pray you're not sayin'
you talk directly

598
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,308
to the Deity?

599
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,748
Don't you know that

600
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,428
only paid Bible-thumpers
can do that?

601
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,033
Have a care, child,

602
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,438
or they'll talking of you
the way they talk of me!

603
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,992
l know some consider it
blasphemous to say this,

604
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,713
but l do talk to God.

605
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,112
l have since l was a small child.

606
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,079
And He answers me.

607
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,993
Mistress Roger Prynne...

608
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,275
by order of the Governor of
Masachusetts Bay Colony,

609
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,514
you are ordered to appear
before the magistrates

610
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,268
at eight tomorrow morn!

611
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,639
Don't be tardy!

612
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,829
Mistress Prynne,

613
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,032
these gentlemen have laid a
charge ofheresy againstyou.

614
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,949
Tell me how it is the laws ofmen
are the imagination ofmortals?

615
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,912
It is the meetings
thatyou call heresy.

616
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,839
Lascivious talk offornication
with savages.

617
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,191
Fallen women who tell lies
about good citizens.

618
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,437
This is what comes when there is
no qualified man present

619
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,200
to guide these women
in their untutored chatterings.

620
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,711
lf the discourse of women
is untutored chattering,

621
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,154
why does the Bible teach that women
shall be the teachers of women?

622
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,595
Hester, we ask that
you cease these meetings.

623
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,916
No, sirs.
l'll not stop the meetings.

624
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,231
Arthur.
Please join us.

625
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,516
l've been fishing, sir..

626
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,672
You may thank me to remain
where l am.

627
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,515
-Please be seated.
-Call our first witness.

628
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,354
ls it truly of import?

629
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,755
Yes, it is of great consequence.

630
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,276
Very well, call your witness.

631
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,148
Goody Gotwick?

632
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,075
Stand up, Goody.

633
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,911
You revealed to my wife
something very disturbing.

634
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,636
Tell me, what does it mean
when a woman

635
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,954
vomits in the morning hours?

636
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,869
And vomits more than once
in the morning hours?

637
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,151
l only saw her the one time.

638
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,999
Yes. And?

639
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,553
Goody Mortimer
saw her get sick in the market.

640
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,917
Are you with child?

641
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,753
Answer your betters, woman!

642
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,118
Do you carry a bastard child
in yur womb?

643
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,390
Yes.

644
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,829
Who is the father?

645
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,949
You are innocent next to the one
who would hide behind your skirts.

646
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,915
We would hang that fornicator!

647
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,152
l'll not reveal the name, sir.

648
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,552
l will tell you his name!

649
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,511
His name is Lucifer!

650
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,836
His name is Legion!

651
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,999
His name is lust!

652
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,996
Gentlemen,

653
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,069
What do you hope to accomplish?

654
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,032
You know there is no law
against pregnancy.

655
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,753
But there is against adultery.

656
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,838
lt would only adultery if
her husband were found to be alive.

657
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,434
The meetings will stop!

658
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,630
Governor,

659
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,315
if you knew the name of this man,
would you punish Hester Prynne?

660
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,634
Has she confessed the name to you?

661
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,353
l've confessed nothing!

662
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,790
-Tell us the truth, Arthur.
-He knows nothing of my affairs.

663
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,958
He speaks as my pastor
to spare me your harsh hand.

664
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,912
But l fear not your punishments!

665
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,755
l love and honor the man who has
fathered this child!

666
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,434
And say what you will,
he is my true husband for life,

667
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,475
and l shall furnish no information
which might cause him harm.

668
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,308
Very well, you leave me no choice.

669
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,034
You're under arrest.

670
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,310
ls this your new Jerusalem?

671
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,390
Let me have a moment alone
with the woman.

672
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,309
-l can draw the name from her.
-You shall have your chance.

673
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,070
Gentlemen.

674
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,912
l've considered all the arguments

675
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,635
and decided Arthur is allowed
to speak to Mistress Prynne alone.

676
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,470
Hester Prynne,

677
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,557
place your hand
on the Good Book.

678
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,759
Let us pray.

679
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,474
Let us pray.

680
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,759
Why did you not tell me?

681
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,269
l was afraid.

682
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,155
l thought if l worked hard,
l would miscarry.

683
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,119
l must go to Bellingham
with the truth.

684
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,634
No, you must not!

685
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,278
You are a saint to these people!
They'll hang you for betraying them!

686
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,949
l prefer to hang, than allow you
to suffer for me.

687
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,758
They've no case against me!

688
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,157
-When they tire, they'll release me.
-l know Stonehall.

689
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,033
You've challenged him,

690
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,272
and he'll not release you

691
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,675
until you are humbled
and have recanted your sins.

692
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,833
Do you believe we've sinned?

693
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,475
l know not.

694
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,115
What happen between us had
a consecration. Have you forgotten?

695
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,675
l've not forgotten!

696
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,116
Arthur, l know you want
to speak out.

697
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,356
Your nature cries out for it.

698
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,471
But you risk your own ruin
and deny me

699
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,148
my right to stand up
to this hypocrisy.

700
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,476
Soldier!

701
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,518
lf l need you to speak,

702
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,630
l'll tie this handkerchief
from the window.

703
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,559
l love thee woman,

704
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,151
but your strength frightens me.

705
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,838
l'll do what you ask.

706
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,150
Amen.

707
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,278
God be with you.

708
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,238
l'm sure he already is.

709
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,509
Gentlemen,

710
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,673
Mistress Prynne has been there
more than 5 months

711
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,791
without any legal justification.

712
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,470
Even in Plymouth they regard this
as barbaric!

713
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,877
l'd like to free her.
At home, l have no peace on this.

714
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,356
But the people see us go to her
week after week, caps in hand,

715
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,630
only to be turned away.

716
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,637
The woman is unrepentant!

717
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,638
She's fortunate we haven't
beaten her publicly!

718
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,957
l'm surprised at you Reverend.
You came here a man of reason.

719
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,394
l came here expecting
some semblance of order.

720
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,279
lnstead l find
a den of fractiousness!

721
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,229
Sir, if you do not
stem this dissent,

722
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,315
my wife and l will return
to England.

723
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,595
And take our parishioners!

724
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,554
lf only she would give us

725
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,591
a small sign of contrition.

726
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,870
Ifit had been up to him,
my father,

727
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,753
he would have ended it and
revealed the truth ofmy origins.

728
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,673
But bound by my mother's wish,
he could not.

729
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,309
He went every day to see her
and was refused.

730
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,111
His eye everon that window
forhersign that it was time

731
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,993
to come forward with the truth.

732
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,756
Had there been flashes ofPrynne's
unstable nature before

733
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,029
in England?

734
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,909
No one knows.

735
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,829
But now, free from
Puritan society,

736
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,834
he was increasingly seized
by spirits so powerful

737
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,555
they were terrifying
even to the Indians.

738
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,154
He has a ghost in him.

739
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,193
He'll bring us bad luck.

740
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,594
Send him home.

741
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,995
Forgive me, Lord,

742
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,153
forI have turned from
my Heavenly Father.

743
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,355
Forgive me.

744
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,549
Lord, bring me back to thy bosom.

745
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,595
God's teeth, child!
How could they leave you thus?

746
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,472
l'm so glad you're here!

747
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,269
6 months and not one visitor.

748
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,393
Some of us came, my dear,
but we were turned away.

749
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,797
Your slave came every day.
How quick are the pains?

750
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,718
-They're not stopping.
-Here.

751
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,757
Take a sip of this.

752
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,954
l wager you won't refuse
my cider this time.

753
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,719
Rvd. Dimmesdale tried always
to get you freed.

754
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,268
-Another?
-Yes.

755
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,756
All right, breathe deep.
Breathe deep.

756
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,110
Hold on to me!
Good girl!

757
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,276
Easy, easy.

758
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,516
Let me see.

759
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,071
All's well. All's well.
lt's close.

760
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,874
lt's very close.
Come, my dear. lt's time.

761
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:43,990
Up you sit.

762
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,912
Good girl. There.

763
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,955
Move down a little.
Good.

764
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,475
This child is ready to be born.

765
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,113
We've work to do!

766
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:54,676
There.

767
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,156
How could they
keep me here so long?

768
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,549
Well, l'll say this,

769
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,469
you must have a will of iron.

770
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,077
When you take on the men,
it leads to death.

771
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,431
All right, my dear.
Chin down and bear down hard!

772
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,029
More and harder!

773
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,993
Harder! Good!

774
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,550
Good girl. That's it.

775
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,319
Easy.

776
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,233
Easy.

777
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,078
Good. Easy.

778
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,874
Are you sure
God's not punishing me?

779
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,549
To be sure he's punishing you.

780
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,438
He be giving you a child!.

781
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,595
Now. Gently.

782
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,671
Now the head is coming.

783
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,798
The head is through.

784
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,956
Just a little more.
Easy.

785
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,157
Easy. Easy.

786
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,439
She'd here!

787
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,797
Oh, thank you, God!

788
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,355
Yes!

789
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,710
Little Pearl.
Yes!

790
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:14,910
Yes!

791
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,279
Harriet, she's here!

792
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,355
She's here.

793
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,753
Sit there, Mistress.

794
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,918
Proceed, Reverend.

795
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,190
l'll have them fetch fresh clothes
for you and the babe.

796
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,514
l bring good news.

797
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,839
l've prevailed upon the Governor.

798
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,953
You are to be freed.

799
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,239
But by law...

800
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,837
you'll be brought to the scaffold

801
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,519
for reprimand.

802
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,156
Hester.

803
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,519
Whatever is said,

804
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,431
please,

805
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,596
be as contrite as
your conscience permits.

806
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,756
lf not for my sake,
for the babe's.

807
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,553
l beg you,
don't anger them further!

808
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,150
l've come to baptize
the babe.

809
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,158
l've died not seeing you.

810
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,473
l came every day.

811
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,558
l baptize this child,

812
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,156
Pearl.

813
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,116
Pearl.

814
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,672
ln the name of the Father,

815
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,915
and the son,

816
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,238
and the Holy Ghost.

817
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,078
May the Lord bless thee,

818
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,154
and care for thee,

819
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,439
and watch over thee.

820
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,630
Amen.

821
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,793
Freeing this woman

822
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,278
is an invitation to every wife

823
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,391
to defy her husband.

824
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,551
Every child it's parent!

825
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,711
No, she should be released.

826
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,756
What?

827
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,992
You don't put her in prison,

828
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,668
you put the prison in her.

829
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,836
So each time someone sees her,

830
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,913
her sin will be marked into
her soul afresh.

831
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,348
Cunningly contrived, my dear.

832
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,431
Make way in the King's name.

833
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,111
A blessing on the righteous
Colony of Massachusetts,

834
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,956
where iniquity is dragged
into the sunlight!

835
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,394
Know ye

836
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,989
that Mistress Roger Prynne

837
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,715
has been ordered

838
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,430
to bear punishment for
fornication and adultery.

839
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,588
lf it be determined later

840
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,597
that her husband be still alive,

841
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,519
she may face a most severe penalty,

842
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,518
which is to be hanged by the neck
until dead.

843
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,475
Pray, silence,
for his Excellency,

844
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:15,909
the Governor.

845
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,112
Hester Prynne,

846
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,356
though you show no
modesty in you apparel,

847
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,553
yet you have a chance, still,
to repent your sins.

848
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,751
Yes, Hester, repent!

849
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,959
Child, don't you believe
you have sinned?

850
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,833
l believe l have sinned
in your eyes,

851
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,114
but who is to know if God
shares your views?

852
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,429
Woman,

853
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,474
transgress not the limits
of Heaven's mercy!

854
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,356
Reverend Dimmesdale,
you are her pastor.

855
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,270
Speak to her for all our sakes!

856
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,510
Soften her, her hardness
her obstinacy!

857
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,439
Listen to the Reverend!

858
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,232
Speak to the woman, my brother.

859
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,028
Exalt her to confess the truth!

860
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,278
Hester Prynne,

861
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,430
you hear what these
good men say,

862
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,311
and see the accountablity
under which l labor.

863
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,829
For your soul's peace,

864
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,757
l charge thee

865
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,196
speak out the name

866
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,550
of your fellow sinner.

867
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,672
Be not silent

868
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,190
for some mistaken pity
or tenderness for him.

869
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,915
For believe me, if he could

870
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,998
step down and stand beside you
on your pedestal of shame,

871
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,959
it would be better than to

872
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,839
carry a guilty heart
through life.

873
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,438
What can your silence
do for him,

874
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,470
except to tempt him?

875
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,995
And compel him

876
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,948
to add hypocrisy to sin?

877
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,959
Speak.

878
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,632
She will not speak.

879
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,434
ln the name of the Lord,
name him!

880
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,433
Name him!

881
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,437
-His name!
-What is his name?

882
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,358
Who might he be?

883
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,679
Very well.

884
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,069
Beadle!

885
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,273
Mistress, if you do not speak out

886
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,948
his name, wear upon your bodice

887
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,158
this symbol of your sinful
fornication.

888
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,070
Heed not this

889
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,958
final warning,

890
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,395
and you will be a pariah,

891
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,553
cut off, shunned
and reviled by every man,

892
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,035
woman and child in this town!

893
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,794
Why do you wait?
Put it on!

894
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,992
lt is not a badge of my shame,
but your own!

895
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:39,634
What do you want?

896
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,351
Have l changed so much,
my beloved,

897
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,036
that you would slay me as l
resurrect myself from the dead?

898
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,795
Roger?

899
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,035
Hester.

900
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,715
Was l ever unkind to you?

901
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,913
Did l not love thee?

902
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,596
Did l not see thee
above all womanhood?

903
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,840
Are you not bound to me
by sacred oath?

904
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,637
Or has this new land turned thee
into a heathen?

905
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,878
Lay our bed will thou, wife.

906
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,949
Pray for thy sins, Hester Prynne.

907
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,469
Beg the Lord to forgive
thy corruption.

908
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,593
Pray and l'll wash thee
as white as snow.

909
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,274
White as snow, my love.

910
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,158
White as snow.

911
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,073
White as snow.

912
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:16,950
Arthur?

913
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,150
Hester?

914
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,952
Thank God you're here!

915
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,193
-Why are you taking this risk?
-l had to warn you.

916
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,755
My husband is alive.

917
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,393
Dear God!

918
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,988
Alive?

919
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,236
Now we'll hang for certain.

920
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,355
Why would he show up at this moment
if he wasn't God's dark messenger,

921
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,312
sent to punish us.

922
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,709
Arthur, you must leave without us.

923
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,912
l cannot bear to see you
trapped here,

924
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,917
under his watchful eye forever.

925
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,755
Hester, l must stay
and watch over you and Pearl.

926
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,791
No. You don't know him.

927
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,959
He'll wait for us to
betray each other

928
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,469
with the slightest glance
or the merest gesture.

929
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,875
Please. You must go!

930
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,192
This God's punishment,

931
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,159
because we tried to run
from His Will.

932
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,198
l will not say farewell, Hester.

933
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,599
Pray God watch over you.

934
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,232
And so will l.

935
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:49,318
Kiss Pearl for me each night.

936
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,319
'Tis easy to see
the mother's part in her.

937
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,749
ls it beyond research,
l wonder,

938
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:27,111
to analyze her nature,
and from it's make and mold,

939
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,272
give a shrewd guess
as to the father?

940
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,232
What are your expectations?

941
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,115
l do not expect your heart
to return to you quickly.

942
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:41,235
But l hope one day
you will draw me again

943
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,435
into your heart.

944
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,757
Love has forced me to open
my heart to another.

945
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,791
Watch your tongue, woman!

946
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,958
'Tis this phantom lover who
puts these words into your mouth1

947
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:52,990
Where is he?

948
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,156
ls his kiss

949
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,316
still wet on your lips,
on your breast?

950
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,597
-l demand to know!
-lf l spent 6 months in a cold jail,

951
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,791
and did not tell these iron men,

952
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,672
what makes you think
l'll tell you now?

953
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,593
These trials have made me strong!

954
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,268
And l am not the child
you married!

955
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,918
Why not announce yourself openly
and cast me off at once.

956
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:13,950
No, no.

957
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,313
l seek no vengeance against you.

958
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,717
But the man lives
who wronged us both.

959
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,558
He bears no letter of infamy

960
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,755
wrought into his garment.

961
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:28,437
But l shall read it on his heart.

962
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,274
Breathe one word to him
of my true identity,

963
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,954
and you will both hang.

964
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,436
lf you try to escape,

965
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,868
you will be easily found.

966
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,157
Easily!

967
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,398
From the savages

968
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,034
l have learned patience,

969
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,039
Hester Prynne.

970
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,191
Goody Gotwick, thank you.

971
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,749
Reverend, allow me to introduce
our newest boarder,

972
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,915
Doctor Chilling...

973
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,031
-Chillingworth.
-Chillingworth.

974
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,755
Good day, man.

975
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,189
Good day, sir.

976
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,956
What brings you
to our colony, sir?

977
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,676
l'm a physician, sir.
l would cleanse the ills

978
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,552
of the community.

979
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,510
Have l said something strange?

980
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,716
No.

981
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,398
l'm amazed.

982
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,194
We have prayed
for a skilled physician.

983
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,713
l see you are translating
the Bible into Algonquin.

984
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,638
A most difficult tongue
to master.

985
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,668
lf l can be of help, Reverend.

986
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:41,110
l am fluent in Algonquin.

987
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,077
-Fluent?
-Yes.

988
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,749
l was a prisoner of the Tarrantine.

989
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,758
When l spoke improperly,
l was whipped.

990
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,520
l learned quite rapidly.

991
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,157
How were you captured?

992
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,117
l was working my farm in Virginia.
They came,

993
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,471
killed my wife, Eleanor,
God rest her soul,

994
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,512
and our infant son,

995
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,634
and sold me into captivity.

996
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,478
lt's a wonder you're not consumed

997
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,558
with bitterness and despair.

998
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,999
No, no. ln truth,
l am indebted to the lndians.

999
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,750
Some say they are savages,
but true savagery,

1000
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,434
l find resides elsewhere.

1001
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,437
Mistress Roger Prynne.

1002
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,759
Mistress Prynne.

1003
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,956
And what is your duty, boy?

1004
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,840
Follow you around, Mistress.

1005
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,514
Well, at least they'll
make a path for me.

1006
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:23,875
Whore!

1007
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,036
God will punish you, sinner!

1008
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,594
Jezebel!

1009
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,036
You're not welcome here!

1010
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,875
Be gone, Hester Prynne!

1011
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,509
Soap, please. Three pieces.

1012
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,717
Although he wore no outward
symbol ofhis shame,

1013
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:17,669
my father wore his own scarlet
letteron the bosom ofhis soul.

1014
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,590
The pain oftheirseparation
must have affected us all.

1015
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,360
I was a troublesome child.

1016
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,396
My fatherached formy mother,

1017
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:31,871
and filled his loneliness
in the wilds with Johnny.

1018
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,479
They struggled

1019
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,352
to keep alive theirdream

1020
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,999
ofbuilding a bridge
between English and Indian.

1021
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,835
Johnny,

1022
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,956
why are they so close to town?

1023
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,438
They say our people have
fallen asleep.

1024
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,594
So they must remain awake
for all of us.

1025
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,514
l'm worried.

1026
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,912
ls war coming?

1027
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,998
The great experiment
is not working, is it?

1028
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,109
Yes, he's right.

1029
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:12,596
lf there's war, what is to stop
our praying lndians

1030
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,909
from rising up

1031
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,594
and slitting our throats
as we sleep?

1032
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,949
Faith, Thomas. Faith.

1033
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,398
l know what will stop them.

1034
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,949
Arthur's friendship
with Johnny Sassamon.

1035
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,350
Johnny would never betray Arthur.

1036
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,318
He worships him.

1037
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,675
As Peter worshipped

1038
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:30,517
Jesus.

1039
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:31,948
Gentlemen.
Doctor.

1040
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,112
lf there's a true war,

1041
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,719
God help us all.

1042
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,718
for neither we nor
the savaged will survive it.

1043
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,879
l see the governor appreciates
the signs less than yee,

1044
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,559
his Godly advisors.

1045
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,075
lt is not always easy.

1046
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,876
Strangely, the same thing
happened in Virginia.

1047
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,438
Before the attack,

1048
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,669
there were signs
that went unheeded.

1049
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,115
What manner of signs?

1050
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,789
The bad winter.
The crop failures.

1051
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,836
Far too many Quakers
and foreigners in the town.

1052
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,875
Some minor elements

1053
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,395
of witchcraft, etc.

1054
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,875
Exactly!

1055
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,915
Our first sign was that

1056
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,714
of Hester Prynne
and her women's meetings.

1057
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,911
Then the severe winter.

1058
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:30,678
The failed crops.

1059
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,074
You see, sir,

1060
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,596
my colleague has feared
from the start,

1061
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,155
that in the matter of
Mistress Prynne,

1062
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,755
witchcraft was involved.

1063
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,674
Then why in all this time
have you not taken measures

1064
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,990
to cleanse your colony?

1065
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,316
What measures do you speak of?

1066
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,990
Did you examine the women
present at those meetings?

1067
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:54,356
Have you queried the midwife,

1068
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,677
or inspected the child
for the witch's marks?

1069
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,552
l shall fear no evil.

1070
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,437
l prepare us a table
in the presence of thine enemy.

1071
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,389
My cup

1072
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,834
runneth over.

1073
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,190
Surely goodness

1074
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,919
and mercy shall follow me.

1075
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,953
l will dwell
in the house of the Lord.

1076
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,553
The babe's clean,

1077
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,034
at present.

1078
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:33,992
Hester,

1079
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,748
we shall leave your child
with you for the present,

1080
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,599
but you must assure us
it will be raised a Christian.

1081
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,554
Yes, yes.

1082
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,035
Yes.

1083
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,271
l've been your friend today.

1084
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,040
But it cannot always be so.
No.

1085
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,873
For inside me l grow
more wretched by the day.

1086
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,839
l yearn so much for thee.

1087
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,191
l fear l might destroy

1088
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,994
her whole world
to win her back.

1089
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,510
Tell old Harriet
what's troubling you.

1090
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,433
l never imagined

1091
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,076
how cruel and cunning
their punishment could be.

1092
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,989
Stonehall y Cheever
stop to preach at me in the street.

1093
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,793
The people pointing and shouting.

1094
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,918
Even the children.

1095
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:14,311
And that horrible drummer boy
following me everywhere.

1096
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,678
Perhaps it was all for naught.

1097
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,277
l wonder if to be a woman
is worthwhile at all.

1098
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,476
Even for the happiest of women.

1099
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,271
Courage, child.

1100
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:38,514
Take heart. At least you've
known what it is to love.

1101
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,388
But what if l've repaid it
by destroying him?

1102
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:43,715
What if

1103
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,837
everything l believed
so strongly was a lie?

1104
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:52,115
Vain and

1105
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:53,711
selfish.

1106
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,237
Prynne's cruelpunishments

1107
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,674
were succeeding.

1108
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,670
The seasons ran theircourse.

1109
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,908
The distance between them
was impassable.

1110
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,275
My mother took the terrible risk
ofwriting to my father,

1111
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,758
reminding to keep theirlove
and his silence.

1112
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,753
The subtle but constant
presence ofPrynne

1113
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,399
was a torment

1114
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,835
that threatened
my father's very soul.

1115
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,759
As forPrynne,

1116
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,639
his lust forrevenge

1117
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,194
fed on itself

1118
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,356
so that he hungered formore.

1119
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,319
Good morrow, Mituba.

1120
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,636
What a pleasant day
for a ride.

1121
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,312
Poor Mituba.

1122
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,949
You're renowned for your loyalty
to your Mistress, and l see why.

1123
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:18,433
Was your dry lunch
a communication from her lover?

1124
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,998
l have the power to arrest you
as an accomplice t adultery

1125
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,800
and bring you before the magistrates
for questioning.

1126
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,957
And since you are a slave,

1127
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,151
they might whip you to death.

1128
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,879
Easy. Easy.

1129
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,828
l only want to help
the one we both love.

1130
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,435
To free herself from the grasp
of a fiend.

1131
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,551
Dear Lord, this is it!

1132
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,997
He made you strip naked
before him!

1133
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,354
Totally naked!

1134
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,398
Was there a presence
in the room?

1135
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,999
Now think! Think!

1136
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,715
He might have come
in one of his many disguises.

1137
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,598
Did he come as a bird?

1138
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,952
Oh, God. l feel

1139
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,196
the presence of Lucifer!

1140
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,234
Save yourself before
it's too late!

1141
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,879
Gentlemen, please!

1142
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:24,870
Enough!

1143
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,389
Enough!

1144
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:33,516
Go home, Mituba.
You've been a wondrous help.

1145
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,471
Commend us to your Mistress.

1146
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,755
Go home.

1147
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,829
Go home.

1148
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,079
So there is a malignancy

1149
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,713
to be cut our here.

1150
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,909
But what kind of witness
will a slave be in court?

1151
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,873
The bird, obviously.
is Harriet Hibbons.

1152
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,154
What is it, Pearl?

1153
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,032
-Forgive me, Hester.
-Harriet.

1154
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,595
Yours was the first place
l thought of to hide.

1155
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,471
What is it?

1156
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,678
They've, they've,
they've ah...

1157
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:24,713
broken into my house.
They're looking for me in the woods.

1158
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,119
l've been named

1159
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,753
as a witch!

1160
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,473
ln the name of God!

1161
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,275
Halt there!

1162
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,549
Yes, sir!

1163
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,276
What's the meaning
of this intrusion?

1164
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,549
Stand aside, woman!

1165
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:00,273
We know the witch is in here.

1166
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,310
There's no one inside

1167
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,199
but me, my child and Mituba.

1168
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,750
So unless you have a warrant,
be gone.

1169
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,631
Reverend Dimmesdale.

1170
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,749
What's happening, major?

1171
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:16,352
We've cornered ourselves a witch.

1172
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,598
Here in Hester Prynne's cottage.

1173
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,550
lf there's a witch
inside the house, major,

1174
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,511
l'll find her.

1175
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,875
Right.

1176
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,993
One man at the door.

1177
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,519
-Soldier!
-Sir?

1178
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,352
Pearl's grown tall.

1179
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,599
She's an elf.

1180
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,668
Willful.

1181
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,678
Dear God, Hester.

1182
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:21,993
lt's been so long.

1183
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:27,193
You'r thin.

1184
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,910
Are you hiding someone, Hester?

1185
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,439
Why do you...?

1186
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,352
Why are you risking

1187
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:49,110
further anger from the elders?

1188
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,869
Because she is no witch!
She's committed no crime

1189
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,439
beyond speaking her mind!

1190
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,351
lf she is innocent,

1191
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,075
l assure you no harm
will befall her.

1192
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,155
Arthur. After all that
has happened,

1193
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,671
how can you still trust
these iron men?

1194
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,432
Don't you see what's happening?

1195
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,669
Last month they brought
Sally Short for questioning.

1196
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:17,037
They held her for 2 days.
Last week it was Mary Rollins.

1197
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:18,832
They just questioned them!

1198
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,754
What's the crime in that?

1199
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,558
The crime is they had nothing!

1200
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,391
Don't you see

1201
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,113
this is some malevolence?

1202
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,069
-What has become of you?
-God, woman!

1203
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,556
What are your demands?

1204
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,637
l've given up everything
l own sacred!

1205
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,119
l'm in Hell!

1206
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,952
ln the eye of your husband,
who lurks at my side day and night.

1207
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,755
ln the eye of all who come to me
to unburden their soul!

1208
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:49,518
l'm a pollution!

1209
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,470
l'm a lie!

1210
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,991
They are the pollution!

1211
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,349
They are the lie!

1212
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,672
But you allow them to destroy
all that is good in you!

1213
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,835
What's happened
to the man l love?

1214
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:03,712
Does he not still live inside thee?

1215
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,508
Our love, woman,
was a folly.

1216
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,913
And the voice we heard,

1217
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:12,510
we have been punished
for listening to!

1218
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,833
What have l become?

1219
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,919
To betray the onlyperson on earth
who had shown herkindness.

1220
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,796
What could feel worse than that?

1221
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,591
Mituba?

1222
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,552
Poor, mute Mituba.

1223
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,908
When Prynne summoned her,

1224
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:36,669
she wanted only to undo the harm
sh'd caused her Mistress.

1225
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,511
Peace in this House!

1226
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,712
Peace, l say. Peace!

1227
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,838
You find these proceedings
humorous, Mistress?

1228
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:53,677
Do you expect me
to take them seriously?

1229
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,279
You're a bunch of grown men

1230
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,836
poking around my private parts
looking for witch's marks!

1231
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,713
The slave, Mituba...

1232
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,558
Peace, l say. Peace!

1233
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:11,591
The witness, the slave Mituba,
has been found dead.

1234
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,391
l told you she was a witch!

1235
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,114
-Mistress Hibbons is a witch!
-She's a witch!

1236
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:23,391
Witch!

1237
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,039
Have you lost all reason?

1238
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,956
There's no witchcraft here!

1239
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:34,675
This is murder!

1240
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,109
Guards,

1241
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,196
restrain this woman!

1242
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,948
Satan is not at work
here among the women!

1243
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,954
But if he's here, perhaps is
at work among you men!

1244
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,599
Here Satan speaks!

1245
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:51,629
Governor?

1246
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,118
l have evidence to render.

1247
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,872
As you know,

1248
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:00,237
Mistress Hibbons midwifed
Mistress Prynne's

1249
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,038
baby Pearl.

1250
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:08,830
Sweet Pearl.

1251
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,349
Bastard!

1252
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:16,430
No!

1253
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,110
Pearl.

1254
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:22,718
l wish you were my girl.

1255
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,316
Poor fatherless child.

1256
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,955
Would you like to learn a game?

1257
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:41,433
Yes. Now do what l do.

1258
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,998
lf l pinch my nose.

1259
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,068
You too.
Very good, very good.

1260
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,076
Now,

1261
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,672
pull up my shirt and
show my tummy tum-tum.

1262
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,276
Now show me your tummy tum-tum.

1263
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,153
Pull up your shirt.

1264
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,910
Behold the witch's mark!

1265
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:21,029
Behold the devil's own child!

1266
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,839
The devil's own child!
The devil's own child!

1267
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,952
This woman is innocent!

1268
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,754
lnnocent? Since you first spoke
of this woman,

1269
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,316
all we've dreames and toiled for
in God's name has been threatened!

1270
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,949
l've heard enough!

1271
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,708
Have you listened?

1272
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:11,674
Factions! Arguments!
Dissent!

1273
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,552
That is the work of Satan!

1274
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,877
The town was in an uproar.

1275
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:23,037
My fatherrisked one last
meeting with my mother,

1276
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:25,392
convinced that ifthey were to hang

1277
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:27,995
Harriet, it would not be long

1278
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:31,994
before my motherand I
would be seized...and hung.

1279
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,558
l had to speak out.

1280
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,233
l couldn't stop myself.

1281
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,073
Damn your husband!

1282
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,352
You and Pearl must go in hiding.
Tonight.

1283
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:52,629
l cannot.

1284
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,748
l cannot run.

1285
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:56,555
What are you saying?

1286
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,035
Forgive me.

1287
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,793
Whatever happens,

1288
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:10,838
promise me
you'll look after Pearl.l.

1289
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:15,669
God, woman, how much further
must you take this?

1290
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,749
As far as my strength
will take me.

1291
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,915
lf Harriet is to hang,
l must hang with her.

1292
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,554
l'll ask the other women
to stand with us.

1293
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,153
They can't hang us all.

1294
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:40,311
Hester, are we ever
to know a life together?

1295
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,354
l love thee.

1296
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,560
l love thee and always will.

1297
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,878
l will always love thee.

1298
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:06,636
Lord God, we stood before thee
naked once,

1299
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,357
and now we stand before thee

1300
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,710
naked again, as a family.

1301
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:16,799
God! Thou has given me this
as a gift,

1302
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:21,275
and l will not give it up!

1303
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,992
Not while l have the strength.

1304
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,395
Arthur?

1305
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:18,950
Arthur?

1306
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:43,509
Arthur?

1307
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:12,397
Evening Mistress Prynne.
Expecting someone else?

1308
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,828
Ah, no.

1309
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,798
Didn't you call out for Arthur?

1310
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,789
The only Arthur l know is...
Dimmesdale.

1311
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,992
You misunderstood me,
l didn't say...

1312
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:25,473
l should have guessed
long ago.

1313
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,355
You naughty girl.

1314
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,157
So you fucked our minister.

1315
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,594
God, l'm about to savour
a priceless morsel!

1316
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,639
Up we go!

1317
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,358
Did he suck your breasts?

1318
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,834
Did he lick you?

1319
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:50,279
Where did he lick you?

1320
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:51,596
Show me!

1321
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,476
How l wanted to put it in you!

1322
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,348
This is to make you pay
for my fantasies.

1323
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,750
While you were torturing me,

1324
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,712
you were giving it to another.

1325
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,078
Damned witch!

1326
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,235
Get out!

1327
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:32,556
Do up your britches
and get out!

1328
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,673
Bastard! Get out of here!

1329
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:47,435
How l will enjoy watching
you and the pastor hang!

1330
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,233
Open up, doctor!

1331
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:06,756
There are matters between us
we must discus immediately.

1332
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:36,034
So, Arthur Dimmesdale.

1333
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,516
At last justice is done!

1334
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,834
¡Ha sido asesinado!

1335
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:21,079
Call out the militia!
Call out the guards!

1336
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:25,672
lt's a sign!
The Lord has sent us a sign!

1337
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,952
We have strayed!

1338
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:33,148
See how he punishes us!

1339
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,469
lt's Brewster.
Those savages

1340
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:37,510
have killed him!

1341
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,319
My son! My son!

1342
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,599
Damned heathens!

1343
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:45,117
Lock up the praying lndians,

1344
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:48,118
before they murder us
in our beds!

1345
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,231
Get the praying lndians!

1346
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:54,517
Praying lndians into the compound!

1347
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:56,799
We are loyal to you!

1348
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,198
We are loyal to you!

1349
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:14,317
By order of the Governor of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony,

1350
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:18,599
you are under arrest
for the crime of heresy.

1351
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,118
Stop this. lt was one of us
who killed Brewster.

1352
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,797
l have proof.

1353
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,715
Bastard!

1354
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:38,158
Johnny, run to Metacomet's
place by the river.

1355
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,588
Tell him to come and
save his people. Run, man!

1356
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:48,434
Here come the witches!

1357
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,477
Open the cell.

1358
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,835
-Never mind the child.
-Pearl!

1359
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:08,679
-Get in, woman!
-Pearl?

1360
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:11,038
Worry not, Mistress.

1361
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:13,435
l'll see she's raised up
to fear the Lord.

1362
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:33,757
Open up, murderer!

1363
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,954
There is no witchcraft here!

1364
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,350
lf we hang these women,

1365
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,956
then what have we become?

1366
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,035
Who are we

1367
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,475
to condemn

1368
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,637
on God's behalf?

1369
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,753
l love this woman.

1370
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:32,472
l am

1371
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:36,350
the father of her child.

1372
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,234
And in God's eyes,

1373
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,958
l am her husband.

1374
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:52,390
lf you must hang someone,

1375
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:54,879
to appease

1376
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:58,557
your anger and fear,

1377
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,399
then hang me.

1378
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,396
Hang him!

1379
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,631
Hang him!
Hang him!

1380
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:47,796
Hang him!

1381
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:46,473
Bastards!

1382
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:27,435
Hester!

1383
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,108
Where's my daughter, Pearl?

1384
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:35,753
She's in the meeting house!

1385
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:09,070
You are free, my people.
Go back to Metacomet!

1386
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:10,999
Go back to the forest!

1387
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:27,119
Bellingham will do anything
to conceal this madness from England.

1388
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,439
He has sworn to me that
he will remove the letter.

1389
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:34,835
And make thee a public apology.

1390
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:40,476
How close they are,
love and hate.

1391
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:44,314
We're no less bound by one
than the other.

1392
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,876
Rest in peace, Roger Prynne.

1393
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:02,795
This letter has served a purpose.

1394
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:04,470
Though not the one

1395
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:05,994
they had intended.

1396
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,396
So why would l stay here?

1397
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:13,508
To be accepted by them?
To be tamed by them?

1398
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:23,871
-There is no perfect world.
-No, not perfect.

1399
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,036
But we came here
to make a new one.

1400
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,719
And for Pearl's sake,

1401
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,839
l must do just that.

1402
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:42,110
Hester.

1403
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:47,235
Hester!

1404
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,469
Look at me.

1405
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:54,877
lf l look at you,
l won't be able to leave

1406
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:56,235
Then leave.

1407
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:59,039
Brave the wilds!

1408
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,228
But Hester,

1409
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:11,750
l'm not letting you
go without me.

1410
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,074
They're watching us.

1411
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:51,035
In the faraway Carolinas,

1412
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,393
they were at last to find
a measure ofthe happiness

1413
02:04:54,640 --> 02:04:57,279
that hade been denied them
forso long.

1414
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:01,073
My fatherdied before
I reached my teens.

1415
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,870
Some say that was
a punishment.

1416
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:08,517
My motherneverremarried
norloved another.

1417
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,350
Some say that was a punishment.

1418
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:13,549
As forme,

1419
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,677
I do not see it that way.

1420
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:19,710
Myparents shared
a love like no other.

1421
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:23,757
I know the spirit ofthat love
lives within me.

1422
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:26,555
And will live within
my children forever.

1423
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:33,598
Who is to say what is a sin
in God's eyes?

1424
