We Quakers believe that the Scriptures be not religion,

我同意
but only the ceremony and history of it.

If I need you to speak,

如果我想跟你f
I'll tie this handkerchief from the window.

上帝c你同在
I'm sure he already is.

705
01:04:22,796 --> 01:04:24,588
我相信他已同在了
Gentlemen,

706
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,760
先生
Mistress Prynne has been there more than 5 months

而]有受到任何合法的判，槭颤N？
Even in Plymouth they regard this as barbaric!

709
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:48,064
甚至B落後的普利毛斯人都指 @Υ她是野U行
I'd like to free her. At home, I have no peace on this.

710
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:51,901
我也很想把她放，阿瑟 @件事我在家Y不得安生
But the people see us go to her week after week, caps in hand,

711
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,454
F在是人看著我 一星期接一星期找她
only to be turned away.

712
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:59,083
s只能o功而返
The woman is unrepentant!

713

@女人不J罪，不曰
She's fortunate we haven't beaten her publicly!

714

I'm surprised at you Reverend. You came here a man of reason.

715
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:06,676
我很奇怪，奇夫牧. 你r是很理智的
I came here expecting some semblance of order.

716
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:10,138
我磉@海先生 是要找到一N有效的秩序

而且ё咚有的教^居民
If only she would give us

她只要表示
a small sign of contrition.

722
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:30,575
一cc悔悟就可以了
Ifit had been up to him, my father,

723
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,699
如果我父H能做Q定
he would have ended it and revealed the truth ofmy origins.

724
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:39,248
他把把我的身世透露出 Kt解@件事
But bound by my mother's wish, he could not.

725

每他在窗羯峡吹侥擞r

可他是受困於日u增多的清戒律中
He has a ghost in him.

He'll bring us bad luck.
