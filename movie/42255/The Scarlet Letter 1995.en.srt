1
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,375
Chief Metacomet.

2
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,576
Without

3
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:51,831
your father's friendship, none of us could have survived.

4
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,212
My father should have let you

5
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,005
die!

6
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,896
You are

7
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,860
the only one

8
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,232
who comes to us

9
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,531
with an open heart.

10
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,317
But your people have murdered

11
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,200
my father

12
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,493
with their lies!

13
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,703
My name is Pearl.

14
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,414
This is the story of my mother, Hester Prynne.

15
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,369
It was the year of our Lord 1666,

16
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:18,957
when she arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony

17
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,958
filled with the hope that at last, in this new world

18
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,347
would come the freedom to worship without fear of persecution.

19
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,354
My esteemed colleague!

20
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:43,647
Thy years of toil become thee!

21
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,029
Thy fame preceeds thee, sir.

22
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,233
Governor Bellingham,

23
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:50,323
may I present

24
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:52,863
the Reverend Thomas Cheever.

25
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,703
Welcome, sir. It's a long voyage.

26
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,994
3 months at sea,

27
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:00,584
will either take away your faith, or harden it to iron.

28
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,837
Allow me to introduce a woman who's been travelling with us,

29
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:08,170
- Mistress... - Hester Prynne.

30
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,509
I apologize for the coarseness

31
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,099
of my hands, Mistress.

32
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,634
But here in the colonies, everyone must work.

33
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,970
I look forward to the hard work.

34
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:20,972
It says id Psalm 92: "I will triumph in the work of thy hands".

35
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:23,856
Thou canst quote the Scriptures.

36
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,113
Aye, Reverendo, both Testaments. My husband taught me.

37
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,397
You must rest.

38
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,859
Then I'll show you what's been accomplished.

39
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:32,943
I thank thee.

40
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,953
- Then it's Goodwife Prynne. - Yes, yes.

41
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:38,997
But I prefer to be called Hester.

42
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,282
Welcome, Hester.

43
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,541
I wish I could've seen it before,

44
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:44,629
when it was wild and untouched.

45
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,132
Madam,

46
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:00,557
you should use less lace in your dressmaking.

47
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,525
Indeed, Reverend.

48
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,530
Master of us all,

49
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:21,202
we give thanks for another bountiful meal,

50
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,830
and for newly arrived disciples,

51
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:27,704
that share it with us this night.

52
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:31,799
- Amen. - Amen.

53
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:35,253
So, Governor.

54
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:39,007
I am impatient to know how you fared with Metacomet.

55
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:43,847
Well, Metacomet isn't Massassoit, Major Dunsmuir.

56
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:47,647
But if we respect the agreements we made with his father,

57
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,015
we've nothing to fear.

58
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,311
So we don't grow complacent,

59
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,902
our wise God sends us a sign.

60
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:56,857
When we sailed,

61
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:59,947
your letters said we were at peace with the savage.

62
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,321
Well,

63
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,993
I fear the days of "peace" with the Wampanoag is at an end.

64
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:07,457
Major,

65
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:11,120
we are frightening our new arrival.

66
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,586
We hear much

67
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,177
of your success with the praying Indians.

68
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,310
I'm very eager to meet Reverend Dimmesdale

69
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,846
and his converts.

70
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,974
The runts of the litter.

71
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,563
Dimmesdale's little treasures!

72
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:31,601
Some of us have other opinions.

73
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:34,893
Mistress Prynne,

74
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,645
I hope you'll stay with us

75
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,573
until your husband's arrival.

76
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,613
You're most kind, but I intend to find

77
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,573
a house of my own as soon as possible.

78
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,579
On thine own?

79
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,004
Why, yes.

80
00:07:57,634 --> 00:08:00,719
It's not considered fitting for a young woman to live alone.

81
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,929
I've come first to prepare a place for his arrival,

82
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,849
so that is what I intend to do.

83
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,265
Mistress Prynne.

84
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,893
The rules we live by may seem arbitrary to a newcomer,

85
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,645
but we have learnt the hard way

86
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,354
that without absolute order,

87
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,022
we cannot hope to survive here.

88
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,031
Rules, Mistress Prynne.

89
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,482
Order.

90
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:25,657
Survival.

91
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:28,072
Would you have me disobey my husband?

92
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:32,831
- I... - Reverend, you might enjoy

93
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,879
the company of my son, Brewster.

94
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,999
He studied Divinity.

95
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,173
Harvard wasn't good enough for him,

96
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,673
so he came home to make his fortune as a...

97
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,888
Minister's sons all moaning the Lord's Prayer

98
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,467
in their sleep.

99
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,225
Everyone must find his place.

100
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,264
- Morning, Mistress Prynne. - Good morrow.

101
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:10,535
So you intend on scandalising the town!

102
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:11,612
Get up!

103
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:13,870
Good!

104
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,283
I confess,

105
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,587
I feel alone in a sea of conformists.

106
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,216
Where should we begin our search?

107
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:26,426
On the cliffs by the sea.

108
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:28,429
No, it's out of the question.

109
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,220
Why?

110
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,925
No one's lived by the sea

111
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:35,926
since the Indians wiped out Ballinger's Point.

112
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,056
I say we start there.

113
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,937
Well, if you've decided.

114
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,380
Is that it, Brewster?

115
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,047
It's beautiful.

116
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,911
I tried to imagine what herlife was like

117
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:42,033
before she came to the new world.

118
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,667
Why did herhusband send heron ahead,

119
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,328
alone?

120
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,253
Was it a test ofherloyalty,

121
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,752
orherspirit?

122
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:54,887
Or was it in his nature to set traps

123
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:57,885
forpeople in the hope they would fall into them?

124
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:07,806
It's perfect!

125
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:10,683
With a cart and a musket, I could have a home here!

126
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:13,404
A cart, a horse,

127
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:15,359
a pitchfork, a plow.

128
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,816
I can think of better things

129
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:19,993
to do with these pretty hands than grow calluses on them.

130
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:23,363
I'll need indentured labor, at least two men.

131
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,958
- The land needs draining. - You are headstrong.

132
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,164
Perhaps it runs in the blood.

133
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:33,040
I'm told your father was too.

134
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,047
Is it true

135
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:39,545
he was in debt to your husband and you were the payment?

136
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:44,386
I've said something to disturb you.

137
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:45,844
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,981
I'm truly sorry.

139
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,225
God, thou art wondrous fair!

140
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:00,108
That hurt!

141
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,943
Good. It'll remind you not to do it again.

142
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,908
Faith? Prudence?

143
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:24,800
Did you hear Mistress Prynne has a bathing tub?

144
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:27,305
What is she, French?

145
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,531
2 Shillings. Will you bid 2 shillings?

146
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:47,488
2 and a half?

147
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:50,623
Come on, gentlemen, do I have a bid for 3 shillings?

148
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,411
3 shillings?

149
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,454
3 shillings?

150
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,580
Anyone else? Anyone else?

151
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:59,799
Going for 3 shillings. Any other bids?

152
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:03,212
Sold to the gentleman for 3 shillings.

153
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,505
- Next we have this other one, - Those two.

154
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,722
How much time left on their indenture?

155
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,392
About 3 years, but,

156
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,807
shouldn't your husband or father be doing business with me?

157
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,140
Is my money no good to you, sir?

158
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,435
Your money's as fine as wine in the sunshine, Mistress.

159
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:24,698
If you buy them at a just price, I'll throw in the girl in red.

160
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,108
She's a slave!

161
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:30,612
But she don't speak, if that be a problem. Born that way.

162
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:34,072
Name your just price.

163
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,287
We'd best accompany you if your going to the forest.

164
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:18,370
Don't worry Mr Bobbin. I shan't go far.

165
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,444
Mistress Prynne? Mistress Prynne?

166
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:24,742
Mistress Prynne?

167
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,201
Where are you?

168
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,538
Mistress Prynne, where are you?

169
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:33,248
I found her.

170
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:34,628
- You did not. - I did to.

171
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:36,633
- You did not. - I did to.

172
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:38,465
Mistress Prynne,

173
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:42,341
Have you forgotten it is the Sabbath?

174
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,635
Of course not. Forgive me.

175
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,848
We've come by especially to bring you to church.

176
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,357
Thank you, so much.

177
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:55,777
Please, go on without me.

178
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:57,896
I will follow at once.

179
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,234
Make haste.

180
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,570
Yes, sir.

181
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:26,004
All right, girl,

182
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:27,757
Come on.

183
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,905
Oh goodnes!

184
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:45,527
Back up. Back up.

185
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,737
Come on now, back up.

186
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,080
Come on. Come on. Back up.

187
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:57,827
Good morrow.

188
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,511
May I be of assistance?

189
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:09,717
Not from up there.

190
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,055
Come on.

191
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,265
Come on. Steady. Steady.

192
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,490
I can't make this horse understand me.

193
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,321
Let me try.

194
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,743
Come on, girl.

195
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:39,543
Come on, back up!

196
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,171
Come on, girl.

197
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,838
Come on. Come on.

198
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:52,464
I'm afraid you're in too deep.

199
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:55,517
She'll not make it. Let me try this.

200
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,846
I do hope you can get it free.

201
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:03,816
I'm already late for the service, and everyone's talking about me.

202
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,026
I've been away and I'm quite behind on local gossip.

203
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,854
I bought the old Newbury place out on Ballinger's Point.

204
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,529
Then,

205
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,159
I owe you an apology.

206
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,371
I've been trespassing.

207
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:21,203
There's a place at the point where I like to bath.

208
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:24,212
Really? Well, I shan't charge too steep a tariff.

209
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,503
Come on, girl, back up!

210
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:31,252
- Back up. - One,

211
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,883
Two,

212
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,597
Two. Three.

213
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,609
I'm afraid this cart will be stuck here until Sabbath next

214
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,355
unless I gather hands to help.

215
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,314
Would you care to ride with me?

216
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,150
On your horse, with you?

217
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,447
Aye, unless you can ride.

218
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,026
I can ride.

219
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,831
You take my horse and I'll take yours.

220
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,701
There's a shortcut to the meeting house,

221
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,379
but it's a difficult road.

222
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:10,915
I shall manage, sir.

223
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,595
- Are you certain? - Just you lead the way.

224
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,598
Come on! Come on!

225
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:46,412
Come on! Come on!

226
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,598
May God be with you.

227
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,976
I'm sure he already is.

228
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,680
But aren't you coming to...

229
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,417
Good Sabbath to ye all.

230
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,089
Friends,

231
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:45,970
and fellow voyagers,

232
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:48,673
in the greatest of all dreams.

233
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,845
We've been singled out, like Israel of old,

234
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,896
to serve as a model.

235
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,272
But if we are to succeed

236
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,481
in building our new Jerusalem,

237
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,569
our "City on a Hill",

238
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,110
then the power of love,

239
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,490
yea, His Divine Love,

240
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,377
we must bind our hearts as one!

241
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:17,707
English and Indian,

242
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,085
gentry and indentured, free man and slaves,

243
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,333
and make of us

244
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,674
an example for all the world,

245
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,094
to marvel at and proclaim:

246
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,635
"Here...

247
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,601
is the measure of perfection!

248
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,598
Here,

249
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,140
lives God's own!"

250
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,271
But we are not succeeding in that test.

251
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,148
We are failing! And why?

252
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,068
Because we covet, nay,

253
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,278
we lust after what is not ours.

254
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,535
Be it for the rich land of our Indian brothers,

255
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,121
be it for glory,

256
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,247
for profits or for revenge.

257
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,792
Need I read the secret

258
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,333
of every heart?

259
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,460
I will if you want.

260
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,299
Yea, I will if you want.

261
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,803
I will lay open the secrets

262
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,721
before the eyes of God!

263
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,228
What thou lusteth after is my enemy, sayeth the Lord God.

264
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,514
For only I shall consume thee,

265
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,394
only I shall fill thee up.

266
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,523
If thou failest to heed my commandments,

267
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,697
then my fist

268
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,909
shall descend on thee like a stone!

269
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:38,665
And thy sword shall cut thee into bloody parts,

270
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,993
and even thy memories shall be sacrificed

271
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,582
to the winds for all time!

272
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,416
May God bless you,

273
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:50,631
each and every one of you.

274
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:53,381
Am幯.

275
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:54,920
Am幯.

276
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,349
Allow me to present a newcomer to our congregation,

277
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:00,841
Mistress Roger Prynne.

278
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:02,428
Mistress Roger?

279
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,767
Aye, her husband, a renowned physician will join her before...

280
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:08,107
Reverednd Dimmesdale and I have already...

281
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:11,440
I helped when her cart got stuck in the woods.

282
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:16,197
I greatly enjoyed your sermon.

283
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:20,652
It's rare for a man so young to speak with such passion.

284
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,157
For some reason,

285
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,540
I felt most inspired today.

286
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:30,504
We welcome you and your husband to our congregation.

287
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:35,088
Mother! Mother!

288
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:48,232
There you are, Hester.

289
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,731
Meet my friend, Running Moose. He's our schoolmaster.

290
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,233
And I'm sure you'd like some refreshment.

291
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:56,115
Do you teach the English children as well Mr Running Moose?

292
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:58,654
They call me John or Johnny here.

293
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:01,952
We try our best, but the English are a bit slow-witted.

294
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:03,615
Slow-witted?

295
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,165
Johnny's a bit of a jester, but he was our first praying Indian.

296
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:09,579
My best friend in the colony.

297
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,618
Arthur,

298
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:14,960
- this is Mistress... - We've already met.

299
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:17,301
Excuse me.

300
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:25,469
So like home.

301
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:29,555
Yet beyond those trees I suspect a savagery,

302
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,848
of savage passions,

303
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,391
dark and untamed.

304
00:25:35,486 --> 00:25:38,405
Reverend Dimmesdale, have you met our young friend?

305
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:40,235
Yes, we've met.

306
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,736
Mistress Prynne and I traveled out on the same ship.

307
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:45,827
I'm going to marry him one day.

308
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,372
No you're not, I'm going to aren't I Mistress Prynne?

309
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,916
- Marry whom? - Reverend Dimmesdale, of course!

310
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:15,348
"A Short Description of the Great and Last Judgement".

311
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,852
Well, "Platform for Church Discipline".

312
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:23,063
They're all tracts!

313
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:32,366
"The Goodwife's Manual... "

314
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,656
for Animal Husbandry"

315
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,121
I believe we've already met.

316
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:39,663
Oh, yes, I... I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

317
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:41,797
I should have announced my presence.

318
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:50,260
What are you reading?

319
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:53,181
- "Comus", it's by John - John Milton.

320
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:54,889
I know it. I've read it.

321
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:56,435
Have you?

322
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,973
I'm not all counterpanes and coverlets.

323
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:01,475
Every spare moment, I read.

324
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,481
I'm the same.

325
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,404
I've read every book in this room. Some of them several times.

326
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:11,155
Even "Manual for Animal Husbandry?"

327
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,113
A most exhiliarating read.

328
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:28,966
So, did you truly enjoy my sermon?

329
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:31,800
Yes, it was most skilful.

330
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,340
Clearly your congregation reverences you.

331
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,344
You liked it not. We don't come up to London standards.

332
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:42,017
To the contrary. I was moved by your passion.

333
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:44,517
And?

334
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:48,319
Well,

335
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:53,817
when your fist struck your hand,

336
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:57,156
and sliced through the air like a sword,

337
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:59,454
I found myself wondering

338
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:03,743
what manner of pain lay beneath such forceful oratory.

339
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,834
Your tongue knows no rules, Mistress Prynne.

340
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:12,760
And if it did, Reverend,

341
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:14,596
what purpose would it serve?

342
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,425
And here I thought comprehending God

343
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,850
was to be my greatest challenge.

344
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:31,401
Yes, Reverend?

345
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,613
This morning in the forest,

346
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:37,193
why did you not say you were married?

347
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:39,487
Why did you not say you were a minister?

348
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:43,371
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

349
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,886
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

350
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:59,011
Good morrow.

351
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:01,098
You care for a cup of cider?

352
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,843
We are your neighbours, it seems.

353
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,768
Did you like the sermon this morning?

354
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:10,434
From where I sat it seemed it did please thee.

355
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:13,312
I liked it very much.

356
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,606
I thought the young minister very...

357
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:16,523
Handsome?

358
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,412
Harriet Hibbons.

359
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:25,822
Ruth?

360
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,205
How do you do?

361
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,786
Come and meet some of the others who were not invited

362
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,336
to the Governer's shindig.

363
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,791
Sally Short, Mistress Prynne.

364
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:37,800
How do you do?

365
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:39,886
I was on the dock when you arrived.

366
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:41,508
Mary Rollins.

367
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:46,804
Mary don't like to speak much.

368
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:50,265
She's only been free from the savages this half year.

369
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:54,231
And Matona don't trust the English, do you dear?

370
00:29:54,903 --> 00:29:56,528
Mistress Prynne?

371
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:59,063
Thank you, no. I never imbibe.

372
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,367
You've gathered some fine Balm of Gilead,

373
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:08,408
Shepherd's Purse, yarrow.

374
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,244
You know your plants?

375
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,495
I do. I recite "Culpepper" by heart.

376
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:15,917
Really?

377
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:23,586
Then what would you use to heal a bad burn?

378
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,179
I've seen sweet fern work miracles,

379
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,718
but Culpepper suggests blackberry and red cedar.

380
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:30,888
Well, you hear that.

381
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:35,899
My husband has a very large library

382
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,603
and I was able to school myself.

383
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,654
How do you like our new Jerusalem?

384
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,650
Sober enough for you?

385
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,409
Aye,

386
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,957
sober enough.

387
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:59,339
What I miss is the dancing.

388
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:00,830
Dancing?

389
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,628
When first we came,

390
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:05,423
they'd be dancing round the maypole.

391
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:08,129
Feast days we'd sing bawdy songs.

392
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:10,388
People weren't afraid to play the fool.

393
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,890
We'd teach the bears to dance.

394
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,768
Now days, everybody getting more and more sourfaced and ponderous.

395
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:21,392
And a whipping post stands where the mayppole used to be.

396
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:25,854
But there's a few of us who haven't forgotten to laugh.

397
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:32,444
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.

398
00:31:32,663 --> 00:31:34,739
I'm sorry I must take my leave,

399
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,411
but I don't want to be stuck in the wilds at night.

400
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:40,835
There are things that sound to me,

401
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,372
the wilds at night are my natural territory.

402
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:46,164
Particulary when there's a full moon.

403
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:49,344
Do you try to frighten me with this witch talk?

404
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:51,381
Not so, Mistress Prynne.

405
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:56,096
But I can see what others cannot.

406
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:59,101
Be a curse, to be sure,

407
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:02,478
but I know the hearts of men.

408
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:06,193
And what does my heart tell you?

409
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,403
You're a most comely woman.

410
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:15,904
Let a man tremble who wins the hand of a maid,

411
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:20,874
but possesses not the full passion of her heart.

412
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:27,163
My husband has nothing to fear.

413
00:32:28,176 --> 00:32:30,216
Good day Mistress Hibbons.

414
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,048
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

415
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,239
Good day, Goody Gotwick.

416
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:01,912
I brought these for Reverend Dimmesdale.

417
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,698
The Reverend be occupied with his work, Missus.

418
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,790
Leave them books on the table and I'll be sure he gets them.

419
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:14,963
Good morrow, Reverend.

420
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,676
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

421
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,799
Knowing you hunger for new reading,

422
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,225
I brought you some books.

423
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,850
How courteous of you.

424
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:31,808
Please.

425
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,986
I must apologize for my forthrightness on Sabbath last.

426
00:33:43,498 --> 00:33:47,116
I've earned a few reprimands for speaking too bluntly.

427
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,373
I owe an apology, too.

428
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,583
I can't understand why I took such offence

429
00:33:58,262 --> 00:33:59,673
to such a simple comment.

430
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:04,343
But I have wondered

431
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,429
how you were able

432
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:10,690
to see so deeply

433
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:13,057
into my nature.

434
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,815
Perhaps I'm a witch.

435
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:32,291
I must be keeping you from your chores.

436
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,496
Thank you for the books.

437
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:36,752
Good day.

438
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,382
I'm sorry. My hands are covered in ink.

439
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:42,883
I've been

440
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:48,058
hovered over my translations all day.

441
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:49,641
Translations?

442
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:52,137
Aye. I'm attempting to

443
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:56,023
translate the Bible into the local Indian language,

444
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:57,100
Algonquin.

445
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,728
What an ambitious undertaking.

446
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:03,657
But I'm told the Indians don't want to be guided by our Bible.

447
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,611
That war with them is inevitable.

448
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:08,237
Some think that way, but they're wrong.

449
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:11,540
The Indians, born from a certain liberty,

450
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,659
take not easily to bridle and bit.

451
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:16,541
No man should.

452
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:18,878
Well...

453
00:35:27,098 --> 00:35:28,046
What?

454
00:35:30,684 --> 00:35:31,384
What?

455
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,436
You keep putting ink on your face.

456
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,438
Oh, I do.

457
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:46,481
There you are.

458
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,662
I do hope you enjoy the books.

459
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,832
Thank you.

460
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,159
Good day.

461
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,625
Good day.

462
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:29,196
Mituba?

463
00:36:31,911 --> 00:36:35,611
'Tis only a bathing tub, not a toy of Satan.

464
00:39:37,423 --> 00:39:38,751
Mistress Prynne?

465
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:43,625
Reverend Dimmesdale!

466
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:47,971
- You frightened me. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

467
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:51,554
It's a wonderful surprise.

468
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:56,979
- It's beautiful. - Yes, and frightening.

469
00:39:58,568 --> 00:40:00,395
Just as Eden must have been.

470
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,362
So untouched.

471
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:06,481
Does it not cry out with it's promise,

472
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,824
that everything can begin anew?

473
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:13,991
I brought back your books.

474
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,034
You couldn't have read them all in four days.

475
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:20,087
Oh no, I did. I read most of them twice.

476
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:25,590
Thank you.

477
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,210
You're welcome.

478
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:30,802
Farewell.

479
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:40,186
Hester...

480
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,769
I'm not the man I seem.

481
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:49,065
I've lived here all my life, my purpose clear.

482
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:53,818
But now I'd risk everything, my life, my ministry, my soul

483
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,364
just to spend a few moments alone with you.

484
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,870
God help me, Hester.

485
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:01,706
I love thee.

486
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,623
God help me. I love thee too.

487
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,093
Oh God. Have we lost our way?

488
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,048
No!

489
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,054
I dreamed of thee speaking thy heart.

490
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,816
I have prayed for it even as I have dreaded it.

491
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:31,196
Was I alive before I laid eyes on thee?

492
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,410
What shall we do?

493
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,621
I know not.

494
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,460
Say something to end it,

495
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,547
for I have not the power.

496
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,339
Nor I.

497
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,764
Nay!

498
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,639
We could be hanged for this.

499
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,024
I've put you in too much danger,

500
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:22,162
and I must end it by walking away and never speaking with you again.

501
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,376
Go then.

502
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,545
Do as you promised.

503
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,570
Throughout the long summer, Mistress Prynne and the Reverend

504
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:32,745
avoided each other at all costs.

505
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:37,122
Mistress Prynne rarely went to town and the Reverend escaped to the wilds

506
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:38,499
with the Indians

507
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:41,287
and faithful Johnny Sassamon for company.

508
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,179
And the colony organized

509
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,466
it's annual election day as usual.

510
00:43:49,935 --> 00:43:52,011
No one the wiser that there existed among them

511
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:54,811
two hearts struggling against a love

512
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:57,728
that grew stronger with each passing day.

513
00:44:07,162 --> 00:44:11,160
Johnny Sassamon says they've attacked the "Intrepid".

514
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,040
What's he saying,

515
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:12,998
Arthur?

516
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:16,000
The Tarrantines

517
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:19,127
attacked an English ship, the Intrepid.

518
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:22,512
All were massacred.

519
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:37,978
"Prynne".

520
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:41,074
"Doctor Roger Prynne".

521
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:17,730
Mistress Prynne.

522
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,114
I'm here as your minister.

523
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:26,367
Come in.

524
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,801
There was an attack,

525
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:42,260
an Indian attack on one of our ships.

526
00:45:44,815 --> 00:45:46,607
They say that,

527
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:49,604
all aboard were massacred.

528
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:01,201
I regret to be...

529
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,867
the one to bring you this sad news.

530
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:07,164
I'll leave you to your mourning.

531
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:13,885
Are you certain none survived?

532
00:46:15,392 --> 00:46:18,392
They say that the tide washed away the bodies.

533
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:20,520
God forgive me!

534
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:23,723
I've prayed so long to be set free.

535
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,816
You did not cause his death, Hester.

536
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:29,737
God...

537
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:31,488
took your husband.

538
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:34,276
But was it an answer to my prayers?

539
00:46:34,497 --> 00:46:35,777
Does He work like that?

540
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:41,667
Perhaps.

541
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:46,004
If in His eyes there was no other way

542
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:48,295
we could be together.

543
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:57,847
I must know what the law is.

544
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,978
The mourning, how long must one wait?

545
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,103
1 month? Six months? What?

546
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,326
Where there is no absolute proof of death,

547
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:17,287
7 years must pass before we're free to be seen in public.

548
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:19,457
7 years?

549
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:22,422
Yes...

550
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:26,586
Greetings, Metacomet.

551
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:28,585
We have been

552
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,006
enemies.

553
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,711
But now Tarrantine

554
00:53:32,931 --> 00:53:36,929
and Wampanoag must unite

555
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,094
to fight

556
00:53:40,315 --> 00:53:42,023
the greedy English.

557
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,197
before theypush us into

558
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,191
the sea.

559
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:20,351
Were the Indians cruel to you, Mary?

560
00:54:21,611 --> 00:54:23,651
After my little one died,

561
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:26,779
they treated me fair and square.

562
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:29,489
If truth be told,

563
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:32,991
cruel is how you folks have treated me since I come home.

564
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:34,073
Thank you.

565
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,706
I didn't do nothing that wasn't forced on me!

566
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:41,081
The thought of being taken by a savage

567
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,587
makes me sick to my stomach.

568
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:47,047
Well, they do it on the backs of their horses,

569
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:49,473
ridin' across the land.

570
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:56,142
Hester, you all right?

571
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,975
Yes, I'm just tired.

572
00:55:04,076 --> 00:55:05,322
Mary's right.

573
00:55:06,454 --> 00:55:08,328
You call them savages.

574
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,498
I could tell you a thing or two

575
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:13,579
about your husband before he tied the knot with you.

576
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:16,036
Stupid slut!

577
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:19,540
Harold would never had nothing to do with no whore!

578
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:21,929
You think not?

579
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:25,968
I've even seen one of your windy ministers

580
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:28,344
pokin' an Injun girl,

581
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:32,273
standin' on a bible so he could roger her better.

582
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:35,695
They always said the Scriptures should uplift you!

583
00:55:43,163 --> 00:55:46,864
I refuse to be with those who would mock the Holy Book!

584
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,665
Well,

585
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,046
she'll not be coming back soon.

586
00:55:58,263 --> 00:55:59,426
Good riddance to her!

587
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,968
We Quakers believe that the Scriptures be not religion,

588
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:06,939
but only the ceremony and history of it.

589
00:56:07,148 --> 00:56:08,263
I agree.

590
00:56:09,192 --> 00:56:12,359
For are not the laws of men but the imagination of mortals,

591
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:15,192
and the inner spirit the true voice of Heaven?

592
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:17,322
Hester,

593
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:20,287
I pray you're not sayin' you talk directly

594
00:56:20,497 --> 00:56:21,777
to the Deity?

595
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:23,279
Don't you know that

596
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,074
only paid Bible-thumpers can do that?

597
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:28,791
Have a care, child,

598
00:56:29,424 --> 00:56:32,341
or they'll talking of you the way they talk of me!

599
00:56:34,054 --> 00:56:37,091
I know some consider it blasphemous to say this,

600
00:56:37,308 --> 00:56:38,886
but I do talk to God.

601
00:56:39,644 --> 00:56:41,388
I have since I was a small child.

602
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:43,439
And He answers me.

603
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,120
Mistress Roger Prynne...

604
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,543
by order of the Governor of Masachusetts Bay Colony,

605
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,921
you are ordered to appear before the magistrates

606
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:10,749
at eight tomorrow morn!

607
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,394
Don't be tardy!

608
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:21,764
Mistress Prynne,

609
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:25,104
these gentlemen have laid a charge ofheresy againstyou.

610
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:29,189
Tell me how it is the laws ofmen are the imagination ofmortals?

611
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:31,235
It is the meetings thatyou call heresy.

612
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:34,288
Lascivious talk offornication with savages.

613
00:57:34,498 --> 00:57:37,784
Fallen women who tell lies about good citizens.

614
00:57:38,002 --> 00:57:41,169
This is what comes when there is no qualified man present

615
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:44,051
to guide these women in their untutored chatterings.

616
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:47,713
If the discourse of women is untutored chattering,

617
00:57:48,348 --> 00:57:52,344
why does the Bible teach that women shall be the teachers of women?

618
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:01,148
Hester, we ask that you cease these meetings.

619
00:58:01,528 --> 00:58:03,568
No, sirs. I'll not stop the meetings.

620
00:58:03,906 --> 00:58:05,983
Arthur. Please join us.

621
00:58:08,245 --> 00:58:10,450
I've been fishing, sir..

622
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,699
You may thank me to remain where I am.

623
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:16,707
- Please be seated. - Call our first witness.

624
00:58:17,296 --> 00:58:18,625
Is it truly of import?

625
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,129
Yes, it is of great consequence.

626
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:23,758
Very well, call your witness.

627
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,711
Goody Gotwick?

628
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:28,763
Stand up, Goody.

629
00:58:30,436 --> 00:58:33,806
You revealed to my wife something very disturbing.

630
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:37,691
Tell me, what does it mean when a woman

631
00:58:38,613 --> 00:58:41,151
vomits in the morning hours?

632
00:58:41,366 --> 00:58:45,234
And vomits more than once in the morning hours?

633
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:49,698
I only saw her the one time.

634
00:58:51,293 --> 00:58:52,668
Yes. And?

635
00:58:57,592 --> 00:59:00,546
Goody Mortimer saw her get sick in the market.

636
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:08,226
Are you with child?

637
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:12,226
Answer your betters, woman!

638
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:17,821
Do you carry a bastard child in yur womb?

639
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,662
Yes.

640
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:39,420
Who is the father?

641
00:59:43,145 --> 00:59:46,846
You are innocent next to the one who would hide behind your skirts.

642
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,937
We would hang that fornicator!

643
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:54,356
I'll not reveal the name, sir.

644
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,988
I will tell you his name!

645
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:07,246
His name is Lucifer!

646
01:00:07,547 --> 01:00:09,670
His name is Legion!

647
01:00:10,216 --> 01:00:12,968
His name is lust!

648
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:15,051
Gentlemen,

649
01:00:20,186 --> 01:00:21,385
What do you hope to accomplish?

650
01:00:21,605 --> 01:00:23,432
You know there is no law against pregnancy.

651
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:25,227
But there is against adultery.

652
01:00:25,443 --> 01:00:28,443
It would only adultery if her husband were found to be alive.

653
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:39,494
The meetings will stop!

654
01:00:39,876 --> 01:00:40,741
Governor,

655
01:00:41,878 --> 01:00:45,627
if you knew the name of this man, would you punish Hester Prynne?

656
01:00:46,717 --> 01:00:48,044
Has she confessed the name to you?

657
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:49,837
I've confessed nothing!

658
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:52,378
- Tell us the truth, Arthur. - He knows nothing of my affairs.

659
01:00:52,597 --> 01:00:55,682
He speaks as my pastor to spare me your harsh hand.

660
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:57,720
But I fear not your punishments!

661
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:00,685
I love and honor the man who has fathered this child!

662
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:05,565
And say what you will, he is my true husband for life,

663
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:09,779
and I shall furnish no information which might cause him harm.

664
01:01:11,202 --> 01:01:13,776
Very well, you leave me no choice.

665
01:01:14,248 --> 01:01:15,576
You're under arrest.

666
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:34,636
Is this your new Jerusalem?

667
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:37,848
Let me have a moment alone with the woman.

668
01:01:38,067 --> 01:01:41,935
- I can draw the name from her. - You shall have your chance.

669
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:44,815
Gentlemen.

670
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:47,777
I've considered all the arguments

671
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:51,659
and decided Arthur is allowed to speak to Mistress Prynne alone.

672
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,002
Hester Prynne,

673
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:06,179
place your hand on the Good Book.

674
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,475
Let us pray.

675
01:02:12,147 --> 01:02:13,392
Let us pray.

676
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:20,990
Why did you not tell me?

677
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:24,650
I was afraid.

678
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,745
I thought if I worked hard, I would miscarry.

679
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:39,094
I must go to Bellingham with the truth.

680
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:40,674
No, you must not!

681
01:02:41,473 --> 01:02:44,474
You are a saint to these people! They'll hang you for betraying them!

682
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:47,258
I prefer to hang, than allow you to suffer for me.

683
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,144
They've no case against me!

684
01:02:49,355 --> 01:02:52,689
- When they tire, they'll release me. - I know Stonehall.

685
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:54,646
You've challenged him,

686
01:02:55,154 --> 01:02:56,981
and he'll not release you

687
01:02:57,198 --> 01:02:59,487
until you are humbled and have recanted your sins.

688
01:03:01,203 --> 01:03:02,781
Do you believe we've sinned?

689
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:09,707
I know not.

690
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,546
What happen between us had a consecration. Have you forgotten?

691
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:16,173
I've not forgotten!

692
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,933
Arthur, I know you want to speak out.

693
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,268
Your nature cries out for it.

694
01:03:27,524 --> 01:03:29,517
But you risk your own ruin and deny me

695
01:03:29,735 --> 01:03:32,309
my right to stand up to this hypocrisy.

696
01:03:32,864 --> 01:03:33,694
Soldier!

697
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,294
If I need you to speak,

698
01:03:48,214 --> 01:03:50,539
I'll tie this handkerchief from the window.

699
01:03:54,304 --> 01:03:55,680
I love thee woman,

700
01:03:58,476 --> 01:04:00,469
but your strength frightens me.

701
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,357
I'll do what you ask.

702
01:04:12,117 --> 01:04:12,982
Amen.

703
01:04:22,796 --> 01:04:24,588
God be with you.

704
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,760
I'm sure he already is.

705
01:04:41,526 --> 01:04:42,557
Gentlemen,

706
01:04:42,986 --> 01:04:45,855
Mistress Prynne has been there more than 5 months

707
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:48,064
without any legal justification.

708
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:51,901
Even in Plymouth they regard this as barbaric!

709
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,454
I'd like to free her. At home, I have no peace on this.

710
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:59,083
But the people see us go to her week after week, caps in hand,

711
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,454
only to be turned away.

712
01:05:01,673 --> 01:05:03,547
The woman is unrepentant!

713
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:06,676
She's fortunate we haven't beaten her publicly!

714
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:10,138
I'm surprised at you Reverend. You came here a man of reason.

715
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:14,765
I came here expecting some semblance of order.

716
01:05:15,022 --> 01:05:17,774
Instead I find a den of fractiousness!

717
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:20,851
Sir, if you do not stem this dissent,

718
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:24,069
my wife and I will return to England.

719
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:27,489
And take our parishioners!

720
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:30,575
If only she would give us

721
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,699
a small sign of contrition.

722
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:39,248
Ifit had been up to him, my father,

723
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:42,255
he would have ended it and revealed the truth ofmy origins.

724
01:05:43,555 --> 01:05:46,341
But bound by my mother's wish, he could not.

725
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,262
He went every day to see her and was refused.

726
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:58,270
His eye everon that window forhersign that it was time

727
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:01,276
to come forward with the truth.

728
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:11,385
Had there been flashes ofPrynne's unstable nature before

729
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:12,712
in England?

730
01:08:13,558 --> 01:08:14,673
No one knows.

731
01:08:18,356 --> 01:08:20,847
But now, free from Puritan society,

732
01:08:21,109 --> 01:08:25,023
he was increasingly seized by spirits so powerful

733
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,861
they were terrifying even to the Indians.

734
01:08:37,253 --> 01:08:39,958
He has a ghost in him.

735
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:43,127
He'll bring us bad luck.

736
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:44,586
Send him home.

737
01:08:48,097 --> 01:08:49,176
Forgive me, Lord,

738
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:53,513
forI have turned from my Heavenly Father.

739
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:55,809
Forgive me.

740
01:08:57,775 --> 01:09:00,183
Lord, bring me back to thy bosom.

741
01:09:02,656 --> 01:09:06,488
God's teeth, child! How could they leave you thus?

742
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:08,445
I'm so glad you're here!

743
01:09:08,954 --> 01:09:11,363
6 months and not one visitor.

744
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:14,621
Some of us came, my dear, but we were turned away.

745
01:09:14,836 --> 01:09:18,171
Your slave came every day. How quick are the pains?

746
01:09:18,382 --> 01:09:20,174
- They're not stopping. - Here.

747
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:22,301
Take a sip of this.

748
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:25,634
I wager you won't refuse my cider this time.

749
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:30,603
Rvd. Dimmesdale tried always to get you freed.

750
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:32,219
- Another? - Yes.

751
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,857
All right, breathe deep. Breathe deep.

752
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:38,312
Hold on to me! Good girl!

753
01:09:38,531 --> 01:09:40,571
Easy, easy.

754
01:09:40,783 --> 01:09:42,905
Let me see.

755
01:09:43,243 --> 01:09:46,612
All's well. All's well. It's close.

756
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,536
It's very close. Come, my dear. It's time.

757
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:50,700
Up you sit.

758
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:52,704
Good girl. There.

759
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,878
Move down a little. Good.

760
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:58,506
This child is ready to be born.

761
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,214
We've work to do!

762
01:10:01,014 --> 01:10:01,844
There.

763
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:05,473
How could they keep me here so long?

764
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,011
Well, I'll say this,

765
01:10:09,565 --> 01:10:12,057
you must have a will of iron.

766
01:10:12,485 --> 01:10:15,820
When you take on the men, it leads to death.

767
01:10:17,074 --> 01:10:20,360
All right, my dear. Chin down and bear down hard!

768
01:10:20,578 --> 01:10:23,069
More and harder!

769
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:26,160
Harder! Good!

770
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:29,870
Good girl. That's it.

771
01:10:30,172 --> 01:10:31,715
Easy.

772
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,711
Easy.

773
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:35,635
Good. Easy.

774
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:43,764
Are you sure God's not punishing me?

775
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:46,554
To be sure he's punishing you.

776
01:10:46,815 --> 01:10:48,524
He be giving you a child!.

777
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:51,816
Now. Gently.

778
01:10:52,072 --> 01:10:53,981
Now the head is coming.

779
01:10:54,575 --> 01:10:56,200
The head is through.

780
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:58,450
Just a little more. Easy.

781
01:10:58,872 --> 01:11:00,746
Easy. Easy.

782
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,382
She'd here!

783
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:11,841
Oh, thank you, God!

784
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:19,724
Yes!

785
01:11:22,022 --> 01:11:24,265
Little Pearl. Yes!

786
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:25,516
Yes!

787
01:11:26,444 --> 01:11:27,987
Harriet, she's here!

788
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:30,152
She's here.

789
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,724
Sit there, Mistress.

790
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,067
Proceed, Reverend.

791
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:21,080
I'll have them fetch fresh clothes for you and the babe.

792
01:12:35,732 --> 01:12:37,061
I bring good news.

793
01:12:37,776 --> 01:12:40,529
I've prevailed upon the Governor.

794
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,731
You are to be freed.

795
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:48,244
But by law...

796
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:51,997
you'll be brought to the scaffold

797
01:12:53,418 --> 01:12:54,794
for reprimand.

798
01:12:57,757 --> 01:12:58,587
Hester.

799
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:01,050
Whatever is said,

800
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:03,045
please,

801
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:06,345
be as contrite as your conscience permits.

802
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:08,598
If not for my sake, for the babe's.

803
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:12,558
I beg you, don't anger them further!

804
01:13:18,322 --> 01:13:20,481
I've come to baptize the babe.

805
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:43,431
I've died not seeing you.

806
01:13:45,394 --> 01:13:46,888
I came every day.

807
01:14:24,898 --> 01:14:26,606
I baptize this child,

808
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:31,401
Pearl.

809
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:34,488
Pearl.

810
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:44,452
In the name of the Father,

811
01:14:46,755 --> 01:14:47,835
and the son,

812
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:52,343
and the Holy Ghost.

813
01:14:55,683 --> 01:14:57,391
May the Lord bless thee,

814
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,598
and care for thee,

815
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:04,024
and watch over thee.

816
01:15:08,489 --> 01:15:09,438
Amen.

817
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:18,994
Freeing this woman

818
01:15:19,627 --> 01:15:22,628
is an invitation to every wife

819
01:15:22,838 --> 01:15:24,831
to defy her husband.

820
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:27,084
Every child it's parent!

821
01:15:27,344 --> 01:15:29,337
No, she should be released.

822
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:30,427
What?

823
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:32,759
You don't put her in prison,

824
01:15:32,976 --> 01:15:35,550
you put the prison in her.

825
01:15:35,771 --> 01:15:37,811
So each time someone sees her,

826
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:41,018
her sin will be marked into her soul afresh.

827
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,944
Cunningly contrived, my dear.

828
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,245
Make way in the King's name.

829
01:15:58,796 --> 01:16:02,082
A blessing on the righteous Colony of Massachusetts,

830
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:06,092
where iniquity is dragged into the sunlight!

831
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:09,677
Know ye

832
01:16:09,892 --> 01:16:12,384
that Mistress Roger Prynne

833
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:15,227
has been ordered

834
01:16:15,482 --> 01:16:19,101
to bear punishment for fornication and adultery.

835
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:25,522
If it be determined later

836
01:16:25,744 --> 01:16:27,618
that her husband be still alive,

837
01:16:27,829 --> 01:16:30,665
she may face a most severe penalty,

838
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:33,793
which is to be hanged by the neck until dead.

839
01:16:34,087 --> 01:16:37,920
Pray, silence, for his Excellency,

840
01:16:38,384 --> 01:16:39,413
the Governor.

841
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,711
Hester Prynne,

842
01:16:42,887 --> 01:16:45,094
though you show no modesty in you apparel,

843
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,514
yet you have a chance, still, to repent your sins.

844
01:16:50,813 --> 01:16:52,806
Yes, Hester, repent!

845
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,238
Child, don't you believe you have sinned?

846
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,320
I believe I have sinned in your eyes,

847
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:07,785
but who is to know if God shares your views?

848
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,156
Woman,

849
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:12,332
transgress not the limits of Heaven's mercy!

850
01:17:12,964 --> 01:17:16,381
Reverend Dimmesdale, you are her pastor.

851
01:17:17,094 --> 01:17:19,419
Speak to her for all our sakes!

852
01:17:20,222 --> 01:17:23,841
Soften her, her hardness her obstinacy!

853
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:30,024
Listen to the Reverend!

854
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:31,894
Speak to the woman, my brother.

855
01:17:32,236 --> 01:17:34,810
Exalt her to confess the truth!

856
01:17:40,745 --> 01:17:42,369
Hester Prynne,

857
01:17:44,374 --> 01:17:46,700
you hear what these good men say,

858
01:17:47,378 --> 01:17:50,747
and see the accountablity under which I labor.

859
01:17:53,051 --> 01:17:55,459
For your soul's peace,

860
01:17:57,682 --> 01:17:59,555
I charge thee

861
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,099
speak out the name

862
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,554
of your fellow sinner.

863
01:18:10,154 --> 01:18:11,981
Be not silent

864
01:18:12,198 --> 01:18:15,650
for some mistaken pity or tenderness for him.

865
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,491
For believe me, if he could

866
01:18:18,705 --> 01:18:21,707
step down and stand beside you on your pedestal of shame,

867
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:23,752
it would be better than to

868
01:18:25,046 --> 01:18:27,798
carry a guilty heart through life.

869
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,638
What can your silence do for him,

870
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:37,843
except to tempt him?

871
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:40,474
And compel him

872
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,554
to add hypocrisy to sin?

873
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:48,780
Speak.

874
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:06,168
She will not speak.

875
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:09,090
In the name of the Lord, name him!

876
01:19:09,764 --> 01:19:11,175
Name him!

877
01:19:14,436 --> 01:19:16,393
- His name! - What is his name?

878
01:19:16,605 --> 01:19:18,396
Who might he be?

879
01:19:31,873 --> 01:19:33,332
Very well.

880
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:34,781
Beadle!

881
01:19:35,502 --> 01:19:37,080
Mistress, if you do not speak out

882
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:39,868
his name, wear upon your bodice

883
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:43,215
this symbol of your sinful fornication.

884
01:19:56,942 --> 01:19:57,724
Heed not this

885
01:19:57,984 --> 01:19:59,693
final warning,

886
01:19:59,945 --> 01:20:02,234
and you will be a pariah,

887
01:20:02,573 --> 01:20:05,528
cut off, shunned and reviled by every man,

888
01:20:05,744 --> 01:20:08,116
woman and child in this town!

889
01:20:13,587 --> 01:20:16,208
Why do you wait? Put it on!

890
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:19,543
It is not a badge of my shame, but your own!

891
01:21:13,196 --> 01:21:14,441
What do you want?

892
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:18,317
Have I changed so much, my beloved,

893
01:21:18,577 --> 01:21:22,160
that you would slay me as I resurrect myself from the dead?

894
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:29,209
Roger?

895
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,316
Hester.

896
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,367
Was I ever unkind to you?

897
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,703
Did I not love thee?

898
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,544
Did I not see thee above all womanhood?

899
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:09,927
Are you not bound to me by sacred oath?

900
01:22:10,553 --> 01:22:13,887
Or has this new land turned thee into a heathen?

901
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:23,524
Lay our bed will thou, wife.

902
01:22:49,263 --> 01:22:51,755
Pray for thy sins, Hester Prynne.

903
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:54,383
Beg the Lord to forgive thy corruption.

904
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:58,683
Pray and I'll wash thee as white as snow.

905
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:04,608
White as snow, my love.

906
01:23:04,948 --> 01:23:06,573
White as snow.

907
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:13,784
White as snow.

908
01:23:57,716 --> 01:23:58,498
Arthur?

909
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:07,050
Hester?

910
01:24:07,269 --> 01:24:08,929
Thank God you're here!

911
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:12,309
- Why are you taking this risk? - I had to warn you.

912
01:24:12,525 --> 01:24:14,980
My husband is alive.

913
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,732
Dear God!

914
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,481
Alive?

915
01:24:22,661 --> 01:24:24,868
Now we'll hang for certain.

916
01:24:25,498 --> 01:24:29,164
Why would he show up at this moment if he wasn't God's dark messenger,

917
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:31,205
sent to punish us.

918
01:24:32,256 --> 01:24:34,746
Arthur, you must leave without us.

919
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:38,086
I cannot bear to see you trapped here,

920
01:24:38,303 --> 01:24:40,177
under his watchful eye forever.

921
01:24:40,431 --> 01:24:44,180
Hester, I must stay and watch over you and Pearl.

922
01:24:44,394 --> 01:24:46,304
No. You don't know him.

923
01:24:46,772 --> 01:24:49,608
He'll wait for us to betray each other

924
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:52,225
with the slightest glance or the merest gesture.

925
01:24:52,529 --> 01:24:53,692
Please. You must go!

926
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:58,193
This God's punishment,

927
01:24:59,578 --> 01:25:02,330
because we tried to run from His Will.

928
01:25:18,224 --> 01:25:21,142
I will not say farewell, Hester.

929
01:25:21,937 --> 01:25:24,689
Pray God watch over you.

930
01:25:26,818 --> 01:25:28,478
And so will I.

931
01:25:31,741 --> 01:25:34,824
Kiss Pearl for me each night.

932
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,154
'Tis easy to see the mother's part in her.

933
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,732
Is it beyond research, I wonder,

934
01:26:10,952 --> 01:26:14,237
to analyze her nature, and from it's make and mold,

935
01:26:14,497 --> 01:26:17,534
give a shrewd guess as to the father?

936
01:26:18,877 --> 01:26:20,621
What are your expectations?

937
01:26:20,921 --> 01:26:24,670
I do not expect your heart to return to you quickly.

938
01:26:25,218 --> 01:26:28,967
But I hope one day you will draw me again

939
01:26:29,223 --> 01:26:30,219
into your heart.

940
01:26:31,475 --> 01:26:34,724
Love has forced me to open my heart to another.

941
01:26:34,936 --> 01:26:36,845
Watch your tongue, woman!

942
01:26:37,063 --> 01:26:40,148
'Tis this phantom lover who puts these words into your mouth1

943
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:41,225
Where is he?

944
01:26:41,527 --> 01:26:42,441
Is his kiss

945
01:26:42,653 --> 01:26:44,693
still wet on your lips, on your breast?

946
01:26:44,948 --> 01:26:48,115
- I demand to know! - If I spent 6 months in a cold jail,

947
01:26:48,327 --> 01:26:50,403
and did not tell these iron men,

948
01:26:50,621 --> 01:26:52,365
what makes you think I'll tell you now?

949
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,411
These trials have made me strong!

950
01:26:55,626 --> 01:26:58,200
And I am not the child you married!

951
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:02,007
Why not announce yourself openly and cast me off at once.

952
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,083
No, no.

953
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,591
I seek no vengeance against you.

954
01:27:06,807 --> 01:27:10,141
But the man lives who wronged us both.

955
01:27:11,479 --> 01:27:13,104
He bears no letter of infamy

956
01:27:13,355 --> 01:27:14,351
wrought into his garment.

957
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,191
But I shall read it on his heart.

958
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:22,193
Breathe one word to him of my true identity,

959
01:27:22,449 --> 01:27:24,988
and you will both hang.

960
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:27,576
If you try to escape,

961
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,070
you will be easily found.

962
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,414
Easily!

963
01:27:33,044 --> 01:27:34,835
From the savages

964
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:37,584
I have learned patience,

965
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:39,676
Hester Prynne.

966
01:28:18,513 --> 01:28:20,506
Goody Gotwick, thank you.

967
01:28:33,905 --> 01:28:37,773
Reverend, allow me to introduce our newest boarder,

968
01:28:37,993 --> 01:28:38,989
Doctor Chilling...

969
01:28:39,203 --> 01:28:41,196
- Chillingworth. - Chillingworth.

970
01:28:42,874 --> 01:28:44,037
Good day, man.

971
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,532
Good day, sir.

972
01:28:49,173 --> 01:28:52,589
What brings you to our colony, sir?

973
01:28:52,968 --> 01:28:56,468
I'm a physician, sir. I would cleanse the ills

974
01:28:56,681 --> 01:28:58,425
of the community.

975
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,639
Have I said something strange?

976
01:29:07,069 --> 01:29:07,982
No.

977
01:29:10,114 --> 01:29:11,822
I'm amazed.

978
01:29:13,867 --> 01:29:17,866
We have prayed for a skilled physician.

979
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:23,622
I see you are translating the Bible into Algonquin.

980
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,758
A most difficult tongue to master.

981
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,916
If I can be of help, Reverend.

982
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:36,549
I am fluent in Algonquin.

983
01:29:37,686 --> 01:29:39,643
- Fluent? - Yes.

984
01:29:40,022 --> 01:29:42,430
I was a prisoner of the Tarrantine.

985
01:29:42,734 --> 01:29:44,525
When I spoke improperly, I was whipped.

986
01:29:44,736 --> 01:29:47,406
I learned quite rapidly.

987
01:29:49,241 --> 01:29:51,199
How were you captured?

988
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,371
I was working my farm in Virginia. They came,

989
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:59,869
killed my wife, Eleanor, God rest her soul,

990
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:01,997
and our infant son,

991
01:30:02,632 --> 01:30:05,253
and sold me into captivity.

992
01:30:09,306 --> 01:30:12,390
It's a wonder you're not consumed

993
01:30:12,768 --> 01:30:14,559
with bitterness and despair.

994
01:30:15,396 --> 01:30:18,148
No, no. In truth, I am indebted to the Indians.

995
01:30:18,441 --> 01:30:22,060
Some say they are savages, but true savagery,

996
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:24,859
I find resides elsewhere.

997
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:37,376
Mistress Roger Prynne.

998
01:30:39,465 --> 01:30:40,840
Mistress Prynne.

999
01:30:46,306 --> 01:30:48,346
And what is your duty, boy?

1000
01:30:48,684 --> 01:30:51,353
Follow you around, Mistress.

1001
01:30:51,603 --> 01:30:54,142
Well, at least they'll make a path for me.

1002
01:31:22,723 --> 01:31:23,719
Whore!

1003
01:31:23,933 --> 01:31:25,973
God will punish you, sinner!

1004
01:31:26,352 --> 01:31:27,598
Jezebel!

1005
01:31:29,064 --> 01:31:31,185
You're not welcome here!

1006
01:31:31,774 --> 01:31:34,146
Be gone, Hester Prynne!

1007
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:45,237
Soap, please. Three pieces.

1008
01:32:12,446 --> 01:32:15,696
Although he wore no outward symbol ofhis shame,

1009
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:19,818
my father wore his own scarlet letteron the bosom ofhis soul.

1010
01:32:21,415 --> 01:32:24,950
The pain of their separation must have affected us all.

1011
01:32:25,169 --> 01:32:27,839
I was a troublesome child.

1012
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:31,004
My father ached formy mother,

1013
01:32:31,258 --> 01:32:34,628
and filled his loneliness in the wilds with Johnny.

1014
01:32:34,846 --> 01:32:36,305
They struggled

1015
01:32:36,514 --> 01:32:38,258
to keep alive their  dream

1016
01:32:38,517 --> 01:32:39,976
of building a bridge between English and Indian.

1017
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:42,934
Johnny,

1018
01:32:44,065 --> 01:32:46,189
why are they so close to town?

1019
01:32:46,818 --> 01:32:49,820
They say our people have fallen asleep.

1020
01:32:50,489 --> 01:32:53,110
So they must remain awake for all of us.

1021
01:32:55,953 --> 01:32:57,199
I'm worried.

1022
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:59,700
Is war coming?

1023
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,918
The great experiment is not working, is it?

1024
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:13,048
Yes, he's right.

1025
01:33:13,268 --> 01:33:16,683
If there's war, what is to stop our praying Indians

1026
01:33:16,937 --> 01:33:18,051
from rising up

1027
01:33:18,313 --> 01:33:20,850
and slitting our throats as we sleep?

1028
01:33:21,065 --> 01:33:22,264
Faith, Thomas. Faith.

1029
01:33:24,068 --> 01:33:25,859
I know what will stop them.

1030
01:33:26,111 --> 01:33:28,518
Arthur's friendship with Johnny Sassamon.

1031
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:31,021
Johnny would never betray Arthur.

1032
01:33:31,365 --> 01:33:33,072
He worships him.

1033
01:33:33,324 --> 01:33:34,487
As Peter worshipped

1034
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:35,364
Jesus.

1035
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:36,856
Gentlemen. Doctor.

1036
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:42,240
If there's a true war,

1037
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:43,916
God help us all.

1038
01:33:44,126 --> 01:33:47,042
for neither we nor the savaged will survive it.

1039
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:55,549
I see the governor appreciates the signs less than yee,

1040
01:33:55,759 --> 01:33:57,301
his Godly advisors.

1041
01:33:58,594 --> 01:34:00,966
It is not always easy.

1042
01:34:01,513 --> 01:34:04,929
Strangely, the same thing happened in Virginia.

1043
01:34:05,892 --> 01:34:07,600
Before the attack,

1044
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:10,968
there were signs that went unheeded.

1045
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:13,517
What manner of signs?

1046
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:16,305
The bad winter. The crop failures.

1047
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:20,523
Far too many Quakers and foreigners in the town.

1048
01:34:22,529 --> 01:34:23,692
Some minor elements

1049
01:34:23,948 --> 01:34:26,319
of witchcraft, etc.

1050
01:34:26,866 --> 01:34:27,862
Exactly!

1051
01:34:28,743 --> 01:34:31,031
Our first sign was that

1052
01:34:31,244 --> 01:34:33,948
of Hester Prynne and her women's meetings.

1053
01:34:34,163 --> 01:34:36,239
Then the severe winter.

1054
01:34:36,456 --> 01:34:38,081
The failed crops.

1055
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:39,537
You see, sir,

1056
01:34:40,043 --> 01:34:42,166
my colleague has feared from the start,

1057
01:34:42,378 --> 01:34:44,834
that in the matter of Mistress Prynne,

1058
01:34:45,173 --> 01:34:47,544
witchcraft was involved.

1059
01:34:47,883 --> 01:34:50,587
Then why in all this time have you not taken measures

1060
01:34:50,844 --> 01:34:53,001
to cleanse your colony?

1061
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,426
What measures do you speak of?

1062
01:34:56,681 --> 01:35:00,298
Did you examine the women present at those meetings?

1063
01:35:00,559 --> 01:35:02,764
Have you queried the midwife,

1064
01:35:02,977 --> 01:35:06,227
or inspected the child for the witch's marks?

1065
01:35:15,904 --> 01:35:17,563
I shall fear no evil.

1066
01:35:22,534 --> 01:35:25,784
I prepare us a table in the presence of thine enemy.

1067
01:35:26,788 --> 01:35:27,818
My cup

1068
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,325
runneth over.

1069
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,738
Surely goodness

1070
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:32,541
and mercy shall follow me.

1071
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:35,704
I will dwell in the house of the Lord.

1072
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:41,542
The babe's clean,

1073
01:35:41,841 --> 01:35:43,085
at present.

1074
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:44,084
Hester,

1075
01:35:44,385 --> 01:35:46,958
we shall leave your child with you for the present,

1076
01:35:47,179 --> 01:35:49,930
but you must assure us it will be raised a Christian.

1077
01:35:51,766 --> 01:35:53,010
Yes, yes.

1078
01:35:58,687 --> 01:35:59,766
Yes.

1079
01:36:06,444 --> 01:36:08,352
I've been your friend today.

1080
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:11,239
But it cannot always be so. No.

1081
01:36:12,114 --> 01:36:16,277
For inside me I grow more wretched by the day.

1082
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,708
I yearn so much for thee.

1083
01:36:29,294 --> 01:36:31,204
I fear I might destroy

1084
01:36:31,421 --> 01:36:34,125
her whole world to win her back.

1085
01:36:59,275 --> 01:37:02,809
Tell old Harriet what's troubling you.

1086
01:37:03,237 --> 01:37:04,814
I never imagined

1087
01:37:05,196 --> 01:37:08,612
how cruel and cunning their punishment could be.

1088
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:15,818
Stonehall y Cheever stop to preach at me in the street.

1089
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,784
The people pointing and shouting.

1090
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:21,999
Even the children.

1091
01:37:25,378 --> 01:37:28,665
And that horrible drummer boy following me everywhere.

1092
01:37:32,469 --> 01:37:34,259
Perhaps it was all for naught.

1093
01:37:39,974 --> 01:37:43,223
I wonder if to be a woman is worthwhile at all.

1094
01:37:44,435 --> 01:37:46,559
Even for the happiest of women.

1095
01:37:47,564 --> 01:37:49,472
Courage, child.

1096
01:37:49,982 --> 01:37:53,895
Take heart. At least you've known what it is to love.

1097
01:37:54,318 --> 01:37:56,891
But what if I've repaid it by destroying him?

1098
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:59,317
What if

1099
01:38:00,448 --> 01:38:03,613
everything I believed so strongly was a lie?

1100
01:38:06,995 --> 01:38:08,074
Vain and

1101
01:38:09,038 --> 01:38:09,737
selfish.

1102
01:38:27,178 --> 01:38:29,051
Prynne's cruelpunishments

1103
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:30,549
were succeeding.

1104
01:38:31,431 --> 01:38:33,672
The seasons ran theircourse.

1105
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:37,047
The distance between them was impassable.

1106
01:38:39,853 --> 01:38:43,684
My mother took the terrible risk ofwriting to my father,

1107
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:48,358
reminding to keep theirlove and his silence.

1108
01:38:48,694 --> 01:38:51,480
The subtle but constant presence ofPrynne

1109
01:38:51,738 --> 01:38:53,196
was a torment

1110
01:38:53,447 --> 01:38:55,735
that threatened my father's very soul.

1111
01:38:59,493 --> 01:39:00,868
As forPrynne,

1112
01:39:01,286 --> 01:39:02,828
his lust forrevenge

1113
01:39:03,121 --> 01:39:04,449
fed on itself

1114
01:39:04,664 --> 01:39:06,703
so that he hungered formore.

1115
01:39:13,462 --> 01:39:15,004
Good morrow, Mituba.

1116
01:39:18,424 --> 01:39:20,547
What a pleasant day for a ride.

1117
01:39:24,721 --> 01:39:26,464
Poor Mituba.

1118
01:39:27,599 --> 01:39:31,299
You're renowned for your loyalty to your Mistress, and I see why.

1119
01:39:33,896 --> 01:39:38,058
Was your dry lunch a communication from her lover?

1120
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:46,986
I have the power to arrest you as an accomplice t adultery

1121
01:39:47,238 --> 01:39:49,908
and bring you before the magistrates for questioning.

1122
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,241
And since you are a slave,

1123
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:56,528
they might whip you to death.

1124
01:39:58,956 --> 01:40:00,414
Easy. Easy.

1125
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,573
I only want to help the one we both love.

1126
01:40:06,003 --> 01:40:08,292
To free herself from the grasp of a fiend.

1127
01:40:08,589 --> 01:40:10,497
Dear Lord, this is it!

1128
01:40:10,757 --> 01:40:14,089
He made you strip naked before him!

1129
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:19,675
Totally naked!

1130
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:23,890
Was there a presence in the room?

1131
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,559
Now think! Think!

1132
01:40:26,102 --> 01:40:28,390
He might have come in one of his many disguises.

1133
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:30,354
Did he come as a bird?

1134
01:40:37,236 --> 01:40:39,062
Oh, God. I feel

1135
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:41,401
the presence of Lucifer!

1136
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:44,568
Save yourself before it's too late!

1137
01:40:44,825 --> 01:40:46,283
Gentlemen, please!

1138
01:40:46,534 --> 01:40:47,316
Enough!

1139
01:40:48,912 --> 01:40:49,943
Enough!

1140
01:40:52,915 --> 01:40:56,330
Go home, Mituba. You've been a wondrous help.

1141
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:59,410
Commend us to your Mistress.

1142
01:41:00,795 --> 01:41:01,791
Go home.

1143
01:41:02,922 --> 01:41:03,953
Go home.

1144
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:15,682
So there is a malignancy

1145
01:41:15,891 --> 01:41:17,385
to be cut our here.

1146
01:41:18,226 --> 01:41:20,717
But what kind of witness will a slave be in court?

1147
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:23,806
The bird, obviously. is Harriet Hibbons.

1148
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:34,524
What is it, Pearl?

1149
01:41:37,783 --> 01:41:39,609
- Forgive me, Hester. - Harriet.

1150
01:41:39,826 --> 01:41:42,281
Yours was the first place I thought of to hide.

1151
01:41:42,494 --> 01:41:43,194
What is it?

1152
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:46,537
They've, they've, they've ah...

1153
01:41:46,747 --> 01:41:49,701
broken into my house. They're looking for me in the woods.

1154
01:41:57,006 --> 01:41:58,464
I've been named

1155
01:41:58,673 --> 01:42:00,167
as a witch!

1156
01:42:02,551 --> 01:42:04,045
In the name of God!

1157
01:42:13,269 --> 01:42:14,265
Halt there!

1158
01:42:14,478 --> 01:42:15,593
Yes, sir!

1159
01:42:21,525 --> 01:42:23,647
What's the meaning of this intrusion?

1160
01:42:23,943 --> 01:42:24,974
Stand aside, woman!

1161
01:42:25,194 --> 01:42:26,771
We know the witch is in here.

1162
01:42:26,987 --> 01:42:27,852
There's no one inside

1163
01:42:28,113 --> 01:42:30,865
but me, my child and Mituba.

1164
01:42:31,283 --> 01:42:33,524
So unless you have a warrant, be gone.

1165
01:42:35,577 --> 01:42:37,569
Reverend Dimmesdale.

1166
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,777
What's happening, major?

1167
01:42:40,414 --> 01:42:43,533
We've cornered ourselves a witch.

1168
01:42:44,876 --> 01:42:47,959
Here in Hester Prynne's cottage.

1169
01:42:48,628 --> 01:42:52,080
If there's a witch inside the house, major,

1170
01:42:53,258 --> 01:42:55,166
I'll find her.

1171
01:42:57,677 --> 01:42:58,673
Right.

1172
01:43:01,472 --> 01:43:02,965
One man at the door.

1173
01:43:03,181 --> 01:43:04,556
- Soldier! - Sir?

1174
01:43:32,872 --> 01:43:34,615
Pearl's grown tall.

1175
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:39,042
She's an elf.

1176
01:43:39,919 --> 01:43:41,199
Willful.

1177
01:43:42,629 --> 01:43:44,336
Dear God, Hester.

1178
01:43:50,468 --> 01:43:51,962
It's been so long.

1179
01:43:55,973 --> 01:43:57,383
You'r thin.

1180
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:07,513
Are you hiding someone, Hester?

1181
01:44:11,902 --> 01:44:13,277
Why do you...?

1182
01:44:14,654 --> 01:44:16,314
Why are you risking

1183
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:20,231
further anger from the elders?

1184
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:24,150
Because she is no witch! She's committed no crime

1185
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:25,786
beyond speaking her mind!

1186
01:44:26,037 --> 01:44:26,737
If she is innocent,

1187
01:44:27,914 --> 01:44:31,661
I assure you no harm will befall her.

1188
01:44:32,084 --> 01:44:35,915
Arthur. After all that has happened,

1189
01:44:36,546 --> 01:44:38,538
how can you still trust these iron men?

1190
01:44:40,715 --> 01:44:42,458
Don't you see what's happening?

1191
01:44:43,426 --> 01:44:45,833
Last month they brought Sally Short for questioning.

1192
01:44:46,094 --> 01:44:49,343
They held her for 2 days. Last week it was Mary Rollins.

1193
01:44:49,555 --> 01:44:51,214
They just questioned them!

1194
01:44:51,973 --> 01:44:53,219
What's the crime in that?

1195
01:44:53,475 --> 01:44:55,099
The crime is they had nothing!

1196
01:44:56,311 --> 01:44:57,010
Don't you see

1197
01:44:57,228 --> 01:44:58,805
this is some malevolence?

1198
01:44:59,396 --> 01:45:01,887
- What has become of you? - God, woman!

1199
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:07,607
What are your demands?

1200
01:45:07,903 --> 01:45:09,776
I've given up everything I own sacred!

1201
01:45:11,948 --> 01:45:13,407
I'm in Hell!

1202
01:45:14,367 --> 01:45:17,403
In the eye of your husband, who lurks at my side day and night.

1203
01:45:17,619 --> 01:45:21,367
In the eye of all who come to me to unburden their soul!

1204
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:23,205
I'm a pollution!

1205
01:45:23,415 --> 01:45:24,197
I'm a lie!

1206
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:27,867
They are the pollution!

1207
01:45:28,085 --> 01:45:29,283
They are the lie!

1208
01:45:29,711 --> 01:45:32,747
But you allow them to destroy all that is good in you!

1209
01:45:33,673 --> 01:45:36,045
What's happened to the man I love?

1210
01:45:36,342 --> 01:45:38,002
Does he not still live inside thee?

1211
01:45:38,343 --> 01:45:40,916
Our love, woman, was a folly.

1212
01:45:41,929 --> 01:45:43,423
And the voice we heard,

1213
01:45:43,722 --> 01:45:47,173
we have been punished for listening to!

1214
01:46:15,122 --> 01:46:16,700
What have I become?

1215
01:46:58,614 --> 01:47:02,658
To betray the onlyperson on earth who had shown herkindness.

1216
01:47:03,618 --> 01:47:05,657
What could feel worse than that?

1217
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:06,486
Mituba?

1218
01:47:06,703 --> 01:47:08,530
Poor, mute Mituba.

1219
01:47:09,706 --> 01:47:10,986
When Prynne summoned her,

1220
01:47:11,207 --> 01:47:14,907
she wanted only to undo the harm sh'd caused her Mistress.

1221
01:47:18,046 --> 01:47:19,954
Peace in this House!

1222
01:47:20,422 --> 01:47:22,249
Peace, I say. Peace!

1223
01:47:23,133 --> 01:47:27,592
You find these proceedings humorous, Mistress?

1224
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:32,636
Do you expect me to take them seriously?

1225
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:35,350
You're a bunch of grown men

1226
01:47:35,559 --> 01:47:39,057
poking around my private parts looking for witch's marks!

1227
01:47:42,564 --> 01:47:44,141
The slave, Mituba...

1228
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:46,064
Peace, I say. Peace!

1229
01:47:46,567 --> 01:47:51,311
The witness, the slave Mituba, has been found dead.

1230
01:47:56,493 --> 01:47:58,401
I told you she was a witch!

1231
01:47:58,702 --> 01:48:01,240
- Mistress Hibbons is a witch! - She's a witch!

1232
01:48:02,914 --> 01:48:03,613
Witch!

1233
01:48:09,168 --> 01:48:10,543
Have you lost all reason?

1234
01:48:11,545 --> 01:48:13,584
There's no witchcraft here!

1235
01:48:14,213 --> 01:48:15,376
This is murder!

1236
01:48:15,841 --> 01:48:16,871
Guards,

1237
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:18,005
restrain this woman!

1238
01:48:21,428 --> 01:48:24,000
Satan is not at work here among the women!

1239
01:48:24,263 --> 01:48:28,176
But if he's here, perhaps is at work among you men!

1240
01:48:28,433 --> 01:48:29,891
Here Satan speaks!

1241
01:48:31,852 --> 01:48:33,050
Governor?

1242
01:48:33,853 --> 01:48:35,644
I have evidence to render.

1243
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:38,516
As you know,

1244
01:48:38,774 --> 01:48:42,024
Mistress Hibbons midwifed Mistress Prynne's

1245
01:48:42,277 --> 01:48:43,901
baby Pearl.

1246
01:48:50,033 --> 01:48:50,982
Sweet Pearl.

1247
01:48:51,368 --> 01:48:52,565
Bastard!

1248
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:58,905
No!

1249
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:01,699
Pearl.

1250
01:49:03,752 --> 01:49:05,460
I wish you were my girl.

1251
01:49:11,258 --> 01:49:13,380
Poor fatherless child.

1252
01:49:13,759 --> 01:49:16,131
Would you like to learn a game?

1253
01:49:22,183 --> 01:49:24,969
Yes. Now do what I do.

1254
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:27,643
If I pinch my nose.

1255
01:49:28,271 --> 01:49:30,843
You too. Very good, very good.

1256
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:31,894
Now,

1257
01:49:34,692 --> 01:49:37,728
pull up my shirt and show my tummy tum-tum.

1258
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:41,485
Now show me your tummy tum-tum.

1259
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:43,442
Pull up your shirt.

1260
01:49:54,249 --> 01:49:57,784
Behold the witch's mark!

1261
01:50:02,548 --> 01:50:06,247
Behold the devil's own child!

1262
01:50:18,518 --> 01:50:22,729
The devil's own child! The devil's own child!

1263
01:50:43,955 --> 01:50:45,781
This woman is innocent!

1264
01:50:45,998 --> 01:50:48,702
Innocent? Since you first spoke of this woman,

1265
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:52,415
all we've dreames and toiled for in God's name has been threatened!

1266
01:50:53,003 --> 01:50:54,117
I've heard enough!

1267
01:50:54,671 --> 01:50:55,951
Have you listened?

1268
01:50:56,339 --> 01:50:59,044
Factions! Arguments! Dissent!

1269
01:50:59,259 --> 01:51:01,001
That is the work of Satan!

1270
01:51:04,596 --> 01:51:06,552
The town was in an uproar.

1271
01:51:07,639 --> 01:51:10,889
My fatherrisked one last meeting with my mother,

1272
01:51:11,517 --> 01:51:13,343
convinced that ifthey were to hang

1273
01:51:13,602 --> 01:51:16,057
Harriet, it would not be long

1274
01:51:16,312 --> 01:51:20,226
before my motherand I would be seized... and hung.

1275
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,984
I had to speak out.

1276
01:51:26,195 --> 01:51:27,772
I couldn't stop myself.

1277
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:30,733
Damn your husband!

1278
01:51:37,286 --> 01:51:40,406
You and Pearl must go in hiding. Tonight.

1279
01:51:40,624 --> 01:51:41,738
I cannot.

1280
01:51:42,667 --> 01:51:43,947
I cannot run.

1281
01:51:44,835 --> 01:51:45,831
What are you saying?

1282
01:51:53,508 --> 01:51:54,670
Forgive me.

1283
01:51:57,094 --> 01:51:58,588
Whatever happens,

1284
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:00,720
promise me you'll look after Pearl. I.

1285
01:52:02,057 --> 01:52:05,756
God, woman, how much further must you take this?

1286
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,967
As far as my strength will take me.

1287
01:52:11,897 --> 01:52:14,352
If Harriet is to hang, I must hang with her.

1288
01:52:18,568 --> 01:52:21,273
I'll ask the other women to stand with us.

1289
01:52:22,489 --> 01:52:23,983
They can't hang us all.

1290
01:52:28,076 --> 01:52:31,444
Hester, are we ever to know a life together?

1291
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:36,701
I love thee.

1292
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,130
I love thee and always will.

1293
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:44,546
I will always love thee.

1294
01:52:55,389 --> 01:52:58,887
Lord God, we stood before thee naked once,

1295
01:52:59,768 --> 01:53:01,725
and now we stand before thee

1296
01:53:01,936 --> 01:53:04,178
naked again, as a family.

1297
01:53:05,356 --> 01:53:09,482
God! Thou has given me this as a gift,

1298
01:53:10,401 --> 01:53:14,148
and I will not give it up!

1299
01:53:16,363 --> 01:53:18,023
Not while I have the strength.

1300
01:53:52,809 --> 01:53:53,888
Arthur?

1301
01:54:13,324 --> 01:54:14,273
Arthur?

1302
01:54:38,844 --> 01:54:39,875
Arthur?

1303
01:55:05,365 --> 01:55:09,990
Evening Mistress Prynne. Expecting someone else?

1304
01:55:10,202 --> 01:55:11,482
Ah, no.

1305
01:55:11,828 --> 01:55:13,535
Didn't you call out for Arthur?

1306
01:55:14,246 --> 01:55:16,653
The only Arthur I know is... Dimmesdale.

1307
01:55:16,873 --> 01:55:19,992
You misunderstood me, I didn't say...

1308
01:55:20,667 --> 01:55:23,621
I should have guessed long ago.

1309
01:55:24,254 --> 01:55:26,626
You naughty girl.

1310
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:29,547
So you fucked our minister.

1311
01:55:32,261 --> 01:55:36,257
God, I'm about to savour a priceless morsel!

1312
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:38,389
Up we go!

1313
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,309
Did he suck your breasts?

1314
01:55:44,562 --> 01:55:45,890
Did he lick you?

1315
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:49,481
Where did he lick you?

1316
01:55:49,941 --> 01:55:50,854
Show me!

1317
01:55:52,776 --> 01:55:54,899
How I wanted to put it in you!

1318
01:56:02,618 --> 01:56:05,190
This is to make you pay for my fantasies.

1319
01:56:06,579 --> 01:56:08,736
While you were torturing me,

1320
01:56:08,955 --> 01:56:10,782
you were giving it to another.

1321
01:56:26,136 --> 01:56:27,844
Damned witch!

1322
01:56:28,054 --> 01:56:29,050
Get out!

1323
01:56:31,432 --> 01:56:33,554
Do up your britches and get out!

1324
01:56:42,356 --> 01:56:45,143
Bastard! Get out of here!

1325
01:56:45,401 --> 01:56:49,065
How I will enjoy watching you and the pastor hang!

1326
01:57:02,913 --> 01:57:04,491
Open up, doctor!

1327
01:57:05,624 --> 01:57:09,206
There are matters between us we must discus immediately.

1328
01:57:37,024 --> 01:57:39,728
So, Arthur Dimmesdale.

1329
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:45,443
At last justice is done!

1330
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:24,809
？a sido asesinado!

1331
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,235
Call out the militia! Call out the guards!

1332
01:59:29,528 --> 01:59:34,022
It's a sign! The Lord has sent us a sign!

1333
01:59:35,699 --> 01:59:37,442
We have strayed!

1334
01:59:39,243 --> 01:59:41,815
See how he punishes us!

1335
01:59:42,787 --> 01:59:45,277
It's Brewster. Those savages

1336
01:59:45,497 --> 01:59:46,363
have killed him!

1337
01:59:46,707 --> 01:59:48,249
My son! My son!

1338
01:59:50,293 --> 01:59:51,668
Damned heathens!

1339
01:59:52,336 --> 01:59:54,293
Lock up the praying Indians,

1340
01:59:54,505 --> 01:59:57,421
before they murder us in our beds!

1341
01:59:57,632 --> 01:59:59,624
Get the praying Indians!

1342
02:00:00,842 --> 02:00:04,092
Praying Indians into the compound!

1343
02:00:05,095 --> 02:00:06,471
We are loyal to you!

1344
02:00:08,307 --> 02:00:10,014
We are loyal to you!

1345
02:00:20,108 --> 02:00:24,733
By order of the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony,

1346
02:00:25,153 --> 02:00:29,198
you are under arrest for the crime of heresy.

1347
02:00:33,076 --> 02:00:35,993
Stop this. It was one of us who killed Brewster.

1348
02:00:38,997 --> 02:00:40,870
I have proof.

1349
02:00:44,835 --> 02:00:45,997
Bastard!

1350
02:00:46,503 --> 02:00:49,587
Johnny, run to Metacomet's place by the river.

1351
02:00:51,299 --> 02:00:55,247
Tell him to come and save his people. Run, man!

1352
02:00:58,971 --> 02:01:00,299
Here come the witches!

1353
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:05,556
Open the cell.

1354
02:01:17,111 --> 02:01:19,482
- Never mind the child. - Pearl!

1355
02:01:19,946 --> 02:01:21,404
- Get in, woman! - Pearl?

1356
02:01:22,072 --> 02:01:23,863
Worry not, Mistress.

1357
02:01:24,074 --> 02:01:26,362
I'll see she's raised up to fear the Lord.

1358
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:47,547
Open up, murderer!

1359
02:02:17,532 --> 02:02:20,069
There is no witchcraft here!

1360
02:02:22,411 --> 02:02:24,652
If we hang these women,

1361
02:02:25,246 --> 02:02:27,368
then what have we become?

1362
02:02:28,374 --> 02:02:29,536
Who are we

1363
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:31,037
to condemn

1364
02:02:31,335 --> 02:02:33,291
on God's behalf?

1365
02:02:42,092 --> 02:02:44,878
I love this woman.

1366
02:02:48,221 --> 02:02:48,756
I am

1367
02:02:50,474 --> 02:02:52,799
the father of her child.

1368
02:02:53,434 --> 02:02:54,762
And in God's eyes,

1369
02:02:55,895 --> 02:02:57,602
I am her husband.

1370
02:03:06,069 --> 02:03:09,521
If you must hang someone,

1371
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,115
to appease

1372
02:03:12,783 --> 02:03:15,949
your anger and fear,

1373
02:03:18,579 --> 02:03:19,954
then hang me.

1374
02:04:01,779 --> 02:04:02,693
Hang him!

1375
02:04:04,073 --> 02:04:06,065
Hang him! Hang him!

1376
02:04:06,449 --> 02:04:07,279
Hang him!

1377
02:05:06,871 --> 02:05:08,448
Bastards!

1378
02:05:49,987 --> 02:05:51,149
Hester!

1379
02:05:56,827 --> 02:05:58,107
Where's my daughter, Pearl?

1380
02:05:58,411 --> 02:05:59,822
She's in the meeting house!

1381
02:06:30,935 --> 02:06:34,553
You are free, my people. Go back to Metacomet!

1382
02:06:35,189 --> 02:06:36,564
Go back to the forest!

1383
02:07:51,790 --> 02:07:55,918
Bellingham will do anything to conceal this madness from England.

1384
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:00,421
He has sworn to me that he will remove the letter.

1385
02:08:01,673 --> 02:08:03,961
And make thee a public apology.

1386
02:08:07,719 --> 02:08:09,841
How close they are, love and hate.

1387
02:08:11,138 --> 02:08:13,843
We're no less bound by one than the other.

1388
02:08:18,561 --> 02:08:20,683
Rest in peace, Roger Prynne.

1389
02:08:30,736 --> 02:08:33,108
This letter has served a purpose.

1390
02:08:33,989 --> 02:08:34,855
Though not the one

1391
02:08:35,115 --> 02:08:36,443
they had intended.

1392
02:08:37,951 --> 02:08:39,990
So why would I stay here?

1393
02:08:40,327 --> 02:08:44,277
To be accepted by them? To be tamed by them?

1394
02:08:51,795 --> 02:08:55,080
- There is no perfect world. - No, not perfect.

1395
02:08:57,216 --> 02:08:59,422
But we came here to make a new one.

1396
02:09:02,762 --> 02:09:04,303
And for Pearl's sake,

1397
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,598
I must do just that.

1398
02:09:13,144 --> 02:09:14,093
Hester.

1399
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,436
Hester!

1400
02:09:21,609 --> 02:09:22,807
Look at me.

1401
02:09:25,529 --> 02:09:27,402
If I look at you, I won't be able to leave

1402
02:09:27,655 --> 02:09:28,818
Then leave.

1403
02:09:30,282 --> 02:09:31,740
Brave the wilds!

1404
02:09:38,998 --> 02:09:40,278
But Hester,

1405
02:09:41,459 --> 02:09:44,992
I'm not letting you go without me.

1406
02:09:57,554 --> 02:09:58,882
They're watching us.

1407
02:10:23,574 --> 02:10:25,945
In the faraway Carolinas,

1408
02:10:26,576 --> 02:10:29,446
they were at last to find a measure ofthe happiness

1409
02:10:29,703 --> 02:10:32,454
that hade been denied them forso long.

1410
02:10:33,539 --> 02:10:36,410
My fatherdied before I reached my teens.

1411
02:10:37,168 --> 02:10:39,326
Some say that was a punishment.

1412
02:10:40,838 --> 02:10:44,171
My motherneverremarried norloved another.

1413
02:10:44,966 --> 02:10:47,124
Some say that was a punishment.

1414
02:10:48,302 --> 02:10:49,416
As forme,

1415
02:10:50,803 --> 02:10:52,677
I do not see it that way.

1416
02:10:53,514 --> 02:10:55,839
Myparents shared a love like no other.

1417
02:10:56,892 --> 02:11:00,058
I know the spirit ofthat love lives within me.

1418
02:11:00,603 --> 02:11:02,974
And will live within my children forever.

1419
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:10,316
Who is to say what is a sin in God's eyes?
