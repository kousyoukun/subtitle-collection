1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,499
Yes, he's right.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,986
If there's war, what is to stop
our praying Indians

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,298
from rising up

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,983
and slitting our throats
as we sleep?

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,340
Faith, Thomas. Faith.

6
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:13,789
I know what will stop them.

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,339
Arthur's friendship
with Johnny Sassamon.

8
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:18,740
Johnny would never betray Arthur.

9
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:20,708
He worships him.

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,065
As Peter worshipped

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:22,906
Jesus.

12
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,337
Gentlemen.
Doctor.

13
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:29,503
If there's a true war,

14
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:31,111
God help us all.

15
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:34,110
for neither we nor
the savaged will survive it.

16
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:42,270
I see the governor appreciates
the signs less than yee,

17
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:43,951
his Godly advisors.

18
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:47,467
It is not always easy.

19
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:51,269
Strangely, the same thing
happened in Virginia.

20
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:53,831
Before the attack,

21
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,063
there were signs
that went unheeded.

22
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:59,507
What manner of signs?

23
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,182
The bad winter.
The crop failures.

24
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:06,229
Far too many Quakers
and foreigners in the town.

25
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:09,269
Some minor elements

26
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:11,789
of witchcraft, etc.

27
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:13,269
Exactly!

28
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,309
Our first sign was that

29
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:19,108
of Hester Prynne
and her women's meetings.

30
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:21,305
Then the severe winter.

31
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,072
The failed crops.

32
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,469
You see, sir,

33
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:26,991
my colleague has feared
from the start,

34
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:29,551
that in the matter of
Mistress Prynne,

35
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:32,151
witchcraft was involved.

36
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:35,070
Then why in all this time
have you not taken measures

37
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:37,386
to cleanse your colony?

38
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:39,712
What measures do you speak of?

39
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,385
Did you examine the women
present at those meetings?

40
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,752
Have you queried the midwife,

41
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:50,073
or inspected the child
for the witch's marks?

42
00:01:59,358 --> 00:02:00,949
I shall fear no evil.

43
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:08,835
I prepare us a table
in the presence of thine enemy.

44
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:10,787
My cup

45
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,232
runneth over.

46
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,588
Surely goodness

47
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,318
and mercy shall follow me.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,352
I will dwell
in the house of the Lord.

49
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,952
The babe's clean,

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,433
at present.

51
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,391
Hester,

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,148
we shall leave your child
with you for the present,

53
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,999
but you must assure us
it will be raised a Christian.

54
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:34,954
Yes, yes.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,435
Yes.

56
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,672
I've been your friend today.

57
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,441
But it cannot always be so.
No.

58
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,274
For inside me I grow
more wretched by the day.

59
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,241
I yearn so much for thee.

60
00:03:09,762 --> 00:03:11,594
I fear I might destroy

61
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:14,397
her whole world
to win her back.

62
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:41,914
Tell old Harriet
what's troubling you.

63
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:43,837
I never imagined

64
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:47,481
how cruel and cunning
their punishment could be.

65
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,393
Stonehall y Cheever
stop to preach at me in the street.

66
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:58,198
The people pointing and shouting.

67
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,323
Even the children.

68
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:06,718
And that horrible drummer boy
following me everywhere.

69
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,085
Perhaps it was all for naught.

70
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,683
I wonder if to be a woman
is worthwhile at all.

71
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,884
Even for the happiest of women.

72
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,679
Courage, child.

73
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:30,921
Take heart. At least you've
known what it is to love.

74
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:33,796
But what if I've repaid it
by destroying him?

75
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,123
What if

76
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:40,245
everything I believed
so strongly was a lie?

77
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,524
Vain and

78
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:46,119
selfish.

79
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,647
Prynne's cruelpunishments

80
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,085
were succeeding.

81
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,080
The seasons ran theircourse.

82
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,319
The distance between them
was impassable.

83
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,686
My mother took the terrible risk
ofwriting to my father,

84
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:23,169
reminding to keep theirlove
and his silence.

85
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:26,164
The subtle but constant
presence ofPrynne

86
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:27,810
was a torment

87
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:30,246
that threatened
my father's very soul.

88
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:35,171
As forPrynne,

89
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,051
his lust forrevenge

90
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:38,605
fed on itself

91
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,769
so that he hungered formore.

92
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:48,732
Good morrow, Mituba.

93
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,049
What a pleasant day
for a ride.

94
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,726
Poor Mituba.

95
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:04,364
You're renowned for your loyalty
to your Mistress, and I see why.

96
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:10,848
Was your dry lunch
a communication from her lover?

97
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:19,413
I have the power to arrest you
as an accomplice t adultery

98
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:22,216
and bring you before the magistrates
for questioning.

99
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,372
And since you are a slave,

100
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,566
they might whip you to death.

101
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,294
Easy. Easy.

102
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:37,244
I only want to help
the one we both love.

103
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,852
To free herself from the grasp
of a fiend.

104
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,967
Dear Lord, this is it!

105
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:45,413
He made you strip naked
before him!

106
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:50,772
Totally naked!

107
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:54,815
Was there a presence
in the room?

108
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,416
Now think! Think!

109
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,132
He might have come
in one of his many disguises.

110
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,017
Did he come as a bird?

111
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:09,370
Oh, God. I feel

112
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,614
the presence of Lucifer!

113
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,652
Save yourself before
it's too late!

114
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,297
Gentlemen, please!

115
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,289
Enough!

116
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,809
Enough!

117
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,936
Go home, Mituba.
You've been a wondrous help.

118
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,890
Commend us to your Mistress.

119
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,175
Go home.

120
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,249
Go home.

121
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,501
So there is a malignancy

122
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,135
to be cut our here.

123
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:49,331
But what kind of witness
will a slave be in court?

124
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:52,294
The bird, obviously.
is Harriet Hibbons.

125
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:02,577
What is it, Pearl?

126
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:07,454
- Forgive me, Hester.
- Harriet.

127
00:08:07,663 --> 00:08:10,018
Yours was the first place
I thought of to hide.

128
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:10,894
What is it?

129
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:14,101
They've, they've,
they've ah...

130
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:17,136
broken into my house.
They're looking for me in the woods.

131
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:25,542
I've been named

132
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:27,177
as a witch!

133
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:30,897
In the name of God!

134
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:40,701
Halt there!

135
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:41,975
Yes, sir!

136
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,701
What's the meaning
of this intrusion?

137
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:50,975
Stand aside, woman!

138
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,698
We know the witch is in here.

139
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:53,735
There's no one inside

140
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:56,626
but me, my child and Mituba.

141
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,176
So unless you have a warrant,
be gone.

142
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:03,057
Reverend Dimmesdale.

143
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,175
What's happening, major?

144
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,779
We've cornered ourselves a witch.

145
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:13,024
Here in Hester Prynne's cottage.

146
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,978
If there's a witch
inside the house, major,

147
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,938
I'll find her.

148
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:23,303
Right.

149
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:27,420
One man at the door.

150
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:28,947
- Soldier!
- Sir?

151
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:57,783
Pearl's grown tall.

152
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,029
She's an elf.

153
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:04,098
Willful.

154
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,108
Dear God, Hester.

155
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,424
It's been so long.

156
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:19,624
You'r thin.

157
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,342
Are you hiding someone, Hester?

158
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:34,872
Why do you...?

159
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:37,786
Why are you risking

160
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,543
further anger from the elders?

161
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:45,303
Because she is no witch!
She's committed no crime

162
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:46,873
beyond speaking her mind!

163
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:47,785
If she is innocent,

164
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:52,508
I assure you no harm
will befall her.

165
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:56,590
Arthur. After all that
has happened,

166
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:59,105
how can you still trust
these iron men?

167
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,866
Don't you see what's happening?

168
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:06,104
Last month they brought
Sally Short for questioning.

169
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:09,471
They held her for 2 days.
Last week it was Mary Rollins.

170
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:11,266
They just questioned them!

171
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:13,190
What's the crime in that?

172
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,992
The crime is they had nothing!

173
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:16,826
Don't you see

174
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:18,548
this is some malevolence?

175
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:21,505
- What has become of you?
- God, woman!

176
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:26,992
What are your demands?

177
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:29,073
I've given up everything
I own sacred!

178
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,556
I'm in Hell!

179
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:36,390
In the eye of your husband,
who lurks at my side day and night.

180
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:40,192
In the eye of all who come to me
to unburden their soul!

181
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,955
I'm a pollution!

182
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:42,908
I'm a lie!

183
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,428
They are the pollution!

184
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:47,787
They are the lie!

185
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,110
But you allow them to destroy
all that is good in you!

186
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:54,273
What's happened
to the man I love?

187
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,151
Does he not still live inside thee?

188
00:11:56,478 --> 00:11:58,946
Our love, woman,
was a folly.

189
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,352
And the voice we heard,

190
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,949
we have been punished
for listening to!

191
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:33,274
What have I become?

192
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:17,363
To betray the onlyperson on earth
who had shown herkindness.

193
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:20,241
What could feel worse than that?

194
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:21,035
Mituba?

195
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:22,996
Poor, mute Mituba.

196
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,352
When Prynne summoned her,

197
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:29,114
she wanted only to undo the harm
sh'd caused her Mistress.

198
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:33,956
Peace in this House!

199
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:36,157
Peace, I say. Peace!

200
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:41,283
You find these proceedings
humorous, Mistress?

201
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:46,122
Do you expect me
to take them seriously?

202
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,725
You're a bunch of grown men

203
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,282
poking around my private parts
looking for witch's marks!

204
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,159
The slave, Mituba...

205
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,004
Peace, I say. Peace!

206
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:04,038
The witness, the slave Mituba,
has been found dead.

207
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,839
I told you she was a witch!

208
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:13,562
- Mistress Hibbons is a witch!
- She's a witch!

209
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:15,839
Witch!

210
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,488
Have you lost all reason?

211
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:25,405
There's no witchcraft here!

212
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,123
This is murder!

213
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,558
Guards,

214
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,645
restrain this woman!

215
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,397
Satan is not at work
here among the women!

216
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,403
But if he's here, perhaps is
at work among you men!

217
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,048
Here Satan speaks!

218
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,079
Governor?

219
00:14:44,849 --> 00:14:46,567
I have evidence to render.

220
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,322
As you know,

221
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,687
Mistress Hibbons midwifed
Mistress Prynne's

222
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,488
baby Pearl.

223
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:01,281
Sweet Pearl.

224
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:02,800
Bastard!

225
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:08,882
No!

226
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:11,562
Pearl.

227
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:15,170
I wish you were my girl.

228
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,768
Poor fatherless child.

229
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,407
Would you like to learn a game?

230
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:33,886
Yes. Now do what I do.

231
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,451
If I pinch my nose.

232
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:39,521
You too.
Very good, very good.

233
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:40,529
Now,

234
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:46,126
pull up my shirt and
show my tummy tum-tum.

235
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:49,730
Now show me your tummy tum-tum.

236
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:51,607
Pull up your shirt.

237
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:05,366
Behold the witch's mark!

238
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:13,485
Behold the devil's own child!

239
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:29,296
The devil's own child!
The devil's own child!

240
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,410
This woman is innocent!

241
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:54,213
Innocent? Since you first spoke
of this woman,

242
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,775
all we've dreames and toiled for
in God's name has been threatened!

243
00:16:58,339 --> 00:16:59,407
I've heard enough!

244
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,167
Have you listened?

245
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,134
Factions! Arguments!
Dissent!

246
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:06,012
That is the work of Satan!

247
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,337
The town was in an uproar.

248
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,497
My fatherrisked one last
meeting with my mother,

249
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,851
convinced that ifthey were to hang

250
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,456
Harriet, it would not be long

251
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,454
before my motherand I
would be seized... and hung.

252
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,019
I had to speak out.

253
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:31,693
I couldn't stop myself.

254
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,535
Damn your husband!

255
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:43,814
You and Pearl must go in hiding.
Tonight.

256
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,091
I cannot.

257
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,210
I cannot run.

258
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:49,018
What are you saying?

259
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:57,497
Forgive me.

260
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,257
Whatever happens,

261
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:03,302
promise me
you'll look after Pearl. I.

262
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,133
God, woman, how much further
must you take this?

263
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,213
As far as my strength
will take me.

264
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:16,379
If Harriet is to hang,
I must hang with her.

265
00:18:20,424 --> 00:18:23,018
I'll ask the other women
to stand with us.

266
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,619
They can't hang us all.

267
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,776
Hester, are we ever
to know a life together?

268
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:37,818
I love thee.

269
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:43,027
I love thee and always will.

270
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,345
I will always love thee.

271
00:18:55,747 --> 00:18:59,102
Lord God, we stood before thee
naked once,

272
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,825
and now we stand before thee

273
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:04,178
naked again, as a family.

274
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,267
God! Thou has given me this
as a gift,

275
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,743
and I will not give it up!

276
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,460
Not while I have the strength.

277
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:51,867
Arthur?

278
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:11,422
Arthur?

279
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:35,983
Arthur?

280
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:04,872
Evening Mistress Prynne.
Expecting someone else?

281
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,304
Ah, no.

282
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:08,274
Didn't you call out for Arthur?

283
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,265
The only Arthur I know is...
Dimmesdale.

284
00:21:11,476 --> 00:21:14,468
You misunderstood me,
I didn't say...

285
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:17,949
I should have guessed
long ago.

286
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,832
You naughty girl.

287
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:23,634
So you fucked our minister.

288
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:30,071
God, I'm about to savour
a priceless morsel!

289
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:32,117
Up we go!

290
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,837
Did he suck your breasts?

291
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,312
Did he lick you?

292
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:42,758
Where did he lick you?

293
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,074
Show me!

294
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,955
How I wanted to put it in you!

295
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:57,828
This is to make you pay
for my fantasies.

296
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:01,230
While you were torturing me,

297
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,192
you were giving it to another.

298
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:19,560
Damned witch!

299
00:22:19,762 --> 00:22:20,717
Get out!

300
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:25,038
Do up your britches
and get out!

301
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,155
Bastard! Get out of here!

302
00:22:36,403 --> 00:22:39,917
How I will enjoy watching
you and the pastor hang!

303
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:54,716
Open up, doctor!

304
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:59,240
There are matters between us
we must discus immediately.

305
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:28,521
So, Arthur Dimmesdale.

306
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,003
At last justice is done!

307
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:09,327
¡Ha sido asesinado!

308
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:13,573
Call out the militia!
Call out the guards!

309
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:18,165
It's a sign!
The Lord has sent us a sign!

310
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,446
We have strayed!

311
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:25,641
See how he punishes us!

312
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:28,962
It's Brewster.
Those savages

313
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:30,004
have killed him!

314
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:31,814
My son! My son!

315
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,094
Damned heathens!

316
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,612
Lock up the praying Indians,

317
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:40,613
before they murder us
in our beds!

318
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:42,725
Get the praying Indians!

319
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:47,012
Praying Indians into the compound!

320
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:49,295
We are loyal to you!

321
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,693
We are loyal to you!

322
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:06,813
By order of the Governor of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony,

323
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:11,097
you are under arrest
for the crime of heresy.

324
00:26:14,818 --> 00:26:17,616
Stop this. It was one of us
who killed Brewster.

325
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:22,294
I have proof.

326
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:27,212
Bastard!

327
00:26:27,698 --> 00:26:30,656
Johnny, run to Metacomet's
place by the river.

328
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:36,086
Tell him to come and
save his people. Run, man!

329
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:40,932
Here come the witches!

330
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,976
Open the cell.

331
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,335
- Never mind the child.
- Pearl!

332
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:01,179
- Get in, woman!
- Pearl?

333
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,539
Worry not, Mistress.

334
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,935
I'll see she's raised up
to fear the Lord.

335
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:26,259
Open up, murderer!

336
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,458
There is no witchcraft here!

337
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:01,854
If we hang these women,

338
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:04,460
then what have we become?

339
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:06,540
Who are we

340
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:07,980
to condemn

341
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,142
on God's behalf?

342
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,258
I love this woman.

343
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:24,979
I am

344
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:28,857
the father of her child.

345
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:30,739
And in God's eyes,

346
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:33,464
I am her husband.

347
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:44,899
If you must hang someone,

348
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:47,388
to appease

349
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:51,065
your anger and fear,

350
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:54,908
then hang me.

351
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:35,908
Hang him!

352
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,142
Hang him!
Hang him!

353
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,308
Hang him!

354
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:38,988
Bastards!

355
00:31:18,838 --> 00:31:19,952
Hester!

356
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,627
Where's my daughter, Pearl?

357
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,272
She's in the meeting house!

358
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,590
You are free, my people.
Go back to Metacomet!

359
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:03,520
Go back to the forest!

360
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:19,647
Bellingham will do anything
to conceal this madness from England.

361
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:23,966
He has sworn to me that
he will remove the letter.

362
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:27,362
And make thee a public apology.

363
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,003
How close they are,
love and hate.

364
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,842
We're no less bound by one
than the other.

365
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,404
Rest in peace, Roger Prynne.

366
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:55,324
This letter has served a purpose.

367
00:33:56,169 --> 00:33:56,999
Though not the one

368
00:33:57,249 --> 00:33:58,522
they had intended.

369
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,926
So why would I stay here?

370
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:06,038
To be accepted by them?
To be tamed by them?

371
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,402
- There is no perfect world.
- No, not perfect.

372
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:20,567
But we came here
to make a new one.

373
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,250
And for Pearl's sake,

374
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,370
I must do just that.

375
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:34,642
Hester.

376
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:39,767
Hester!

377
00:34:41,852 --> 00:34:43,001
Look at me.

378
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,409
If I look at you,
I won't be able to leave

379
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,767
Then leave.

380
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,570
Brave the wilds!

381
00:34:58,534 --> 00:34:59,761
But Hester,

382
00:35:00,895 --> 00:35:04,284
I'm not letting you
go without me.

383
00:35:16,335 --> 00:35:17,608
They're watching us.

384
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:43,571
In the faraway Carolinas,

385
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:46,930
they were at last to find
a measure ofthe happiness

386
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:49,815
that hade been denied them
forso long.

387
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:53,610
My fatherdied before
I reached my teens.

388
00:35:54,338 --> 00:35:56,408
Some say that was
a punishment.

389
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,056
My motherneverremarried
norloved another.

390
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:03,889
Some say that was a punishment.

391
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:06,087
As forme,

392
00:36:07,418 --> 00:36:09,215
I do not see it that way.

393
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:12,249
Myparents shared
a love like no other.

394
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,297
I know the spirit ofthat love
lives within me.

395
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,094
And will live within
my children forever.

396
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,138
Who is to say what is a sin
in God's eyes?
