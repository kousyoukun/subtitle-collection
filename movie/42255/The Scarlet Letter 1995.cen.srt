1
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,375
麥特坎姆先生
Chief Metacomet.

2
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,576
沒有您父親的幫忙
Without

3
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:51,831
我們誰也活不過第一個冬天.
your father's friendship, none of us could have survived.

4
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,212
我父親應該讓你們
My father should have let you

5
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,005
去死!
die!

6
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,896
你是
You are

7
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,860
唯一
the only one

8
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,232
帶著坦誠之心
who comes to us

9
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,531
來找我們的人.
with an open heart.

10
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,317
可你的人用謊言
But your people have murdered

11
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,200
謀殺了
my father

12
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,493
我的父親!
with their lies!

13
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,703
我叫珠兒.
My name is Pearl.

14
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,414
這個故事是關於我的母親, 海絲特·白蘭因.
This is the story of my mother, Hester Prynne.

15
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,369
那是在1666年,
It was the year of our Lord 1666,

16
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:18,957
當她到達了馬賽諸賽海岸殖民地
when she arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony

17
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,958
滿心希望在這裏，在這個新世界裏
filled with the hope that at last, in this new world

18
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,347
能夠最終自由的信仰，而沒有恐懼和迫害
would come the freedom to worship without fear of persecution.

19
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,354
我尊敬的同僚!
My esteemed colleague!

20
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:43,647
多年的辛苦讓你更健康了!
Thy years of toil become thee!

21
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,029
久仰您的大名，先生.
Thy fame preceeds thee, sir.

22
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,233
貝靈漢總督,
Governor Bellingham,

23
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:50,323
允許我介紹
may I present

24
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:52,863
托馬斯·奇夫牧師.
the Reverend Thomas Cheever.

25
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,703
歡迎您先生. 一路辛苦了.
Welcome, sir. It's a long voyage.

26
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,994
海上三個月,
3 months at sea,

27
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:00,584
要麼奪走你的信仰, 要麼使它堅硬如鐵.
will either take away your faith, or harden it to iron.

28
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,837
貝靈漢總督 允許我向您介紹一位與我們同行的女士
Allow me to introduce a woman who's been travelling with us,

29
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:08,170
海絲特·白蘭因夫人
- Mistress... - Hester Prynne.

30
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,509
請原諒我這雙
I apologize for the coarseness

31
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:12,099
粗糙的手, 夫人.
of my hands, Mistress.

32
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,634
不過這裏是殖民地, 誰都得幹活.
But here in the colonies, everyone must work.

33
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,970
我渴望繁重的工作,總督.
I look forward to the hard work.

34
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:20,972
就像《舊約》92篇中所寫的: "我將靠自己的雙手 取得勝利".
It says id Psalm 92: "I will triumph in the work of thy hands".

35
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:23,856
沒想道您會引用聖經.
Thou canst quote the Scriptures.

36
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,113
是的，牧師，舊約和新約 我丈夫教我的
Aye, Reverendo, both Testaments. My husband taught me.

37
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,397
您得休息了，奇夫牧師.
You must rest.

38
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,859
然後，我很願意帶您參觀我們的成就
Then I'll show you what's been accomplished.

39
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:32,943
非常感謝.
I thank thee.

40
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,953
- 哦，這是白蘭因太太. - 是的，是的.
- Then it's Goodwife Prynne. - Yes, yes.

41
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:38,997
不過我更喜歡別人叫我海絲特.
But I prefer to be called Hester.

42
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,282
歡迎你, 海絲特.
Welcome, Hester.

43
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,541
要是能跟著第一批來這兒多好,
I wish I could've seen it before,

44
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:44,629
當時還是原始的荒蠻之地
when it was wild and untouched.

45
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,132
太太,
Madam,

46
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:00,557
在這個地方 少掛點裝飾會更好.
you should use less lace in your dressmaking.

47
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,525
當然, 牧師.
Indeed, Reverend.

48
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,530
全能的上帝啊,
Master of us all,

49
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:21,202
感謝您再次慷慨地賜予我們食物
we give thanks for another bountiful meal,

50
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,830
感謝這些新到達的信徒,
and for newly arrived disciples,

51
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:27,704
與我們分享此宴.
that share it with us this night.

52
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:31,799
- 阿門. - 阿門.
- Amen. - Amen.

53
00:06:34,304 --> 00:06:35,253
總督先生.
So, Governor.

54
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:39,007
我迫不及待地想知道 你和麥特坎姆談判的情況.
I am impatient to know how you fared with Metacomet.

55
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:43,847
哦，麥特坎姆不是瑪薩索米，鄧姆上校.
Well, Metacomet isn't Massassoit, Major Dunsmuir.

56
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:47,647
但我相信如果我們遵守與他父親之間的協議
But if we respect the agreements we made with his father,

57
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,015
就沒什麼可怕的
we've nothing to fear.

58
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,311
英名的上帝怕我們
So we don't grow complacent,

59
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,902
得意忘形
our wise God sends us a sign.

60
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:56,857
所以下了神諭
When we sailed,

61
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:59,947
總督先生，我們在信上看到你說我們與野人和平相處.
your letters said we were at peace with the savage.

62
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,321
哦,
Well,

63
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,993
跟帕諾亞人所謂的和平日子就要到頭了
I fear the days of "peace" with the Wampanoag is at an end.

64
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:07,457
少校,
Major,

65
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:11,120
我們嚇著這些新來的人了
we are frightening our new arrival.

66
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,586
我在家常聽說你們
We hear much

67
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,177
讓印第安人皈依我主
of your success with the praying Indians.

68
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,310
我非常渴望拜見丁梅斯黛爾牧師
I'm very eager to meet Reverend Dimmesdale

69
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,846
和他的皈依者
and his converts.

70
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,974
那一窩侏儒
The runts of the litter.

71
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,563
丁梅斯黛爾是個小寶貝
Dimmesdale's little treasures!

72
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:31,601
我們有些人有不同看法
Some of us have other opinions.

73
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:34,893
白蘭因太太,
Mistress Prynne,

74
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:37,645
我希望你能跟我們住在這兒
I hope you'll stay with us

75
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:39,573
等你丈夫到了再說
until your husband's arrival.

76
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,613
你可真好，斯頓赫爾太太 不過我想
You're most kind, but I intend to find

77
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,573
自己找到房子，越快越好
a house of my own as soon as possible.

78
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,579
你自己住
On thine own?

79
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,004
是的
Why, yes.

80
00:07:57,634 --> 00:08:00,719
在這兒一個年輕女人自己住可不好
It's not considered fitting for a young woman to live alone.

81
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,929
可是我丈夫吩咐我先找好住所等著他來
I've come first to prepare a place for his arrival,

82
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,849
所以我想先找房子
so that is what I intend to do.

83
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,265
白蘭因太太
Mistress Prynne.

84
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,893
我們的生活規定也許對新來者專橫了些
The rules we live by may seem arbitrary to a newcomer,

85
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,645
不過我們有慘痛的教訓
but we have learnt the hard way

86
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,354
如果在這兒沒有嚴格的規定
that without absolute order,

87
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,022
就無法生存
we cannot hope to survive here.

88
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,031
規定, 白蘭因太太
Rules, Mistress Prynne.

89
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:23,482
有序.
Order.

90
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:25,657
才能生存.
Survival.

91
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:28,072
你們是想要我違抗丈夫的意思
Would you have me disobey my husband?

92
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:32,831
- 我…… - 奇夫牧師, 你也許願意
- I... - Reverend, you might enjoy

93
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,879
讓我兒子陪你住，他叫布魯斯特
the company of my son, Brewster.

94
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,999
在大學學過神學
He studied Divinity.

95
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,173
哈佛不適合他
Harvard wasn't good enough for him,

96
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,673
所以他只好回家……
so he came home to make his fortune as a...

97
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,888
一般牧師的孩子睡覺的時候
Minister's sons all moaning the Lord's Prayer

98
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,467
嘴裏嘟噥著禱告詞
in their sleep.

99
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,225
每個人都得有自己的位置.
Everyone must find his place.

100
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,264
- 早上好, 白蘭因太太 - 早上好.
- Morning, Mistress Prynne. - Good morrow.

101
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:10,535
你到這兒來是不是想招他們的反感
So you intend on scandalising the town!

102
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:11,612
駕
Get up!

103
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:13,870
很好
Good!

104
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,283
我很煩
I confess,

105
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:20,587
我厭倦了唯唯諾諾的生活
I feel alone in a sea of conformists.

106
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,216
我們從哪兒開始找
Where should we begin our search?

107
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:26,426
海邊的懸崖上
On the cliffs by the sea.

108
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:28,429
不，那可不行
No, it's out of the question.

109
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,220
為什麼？
Why?

110
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:32,925
波靈被印第安人消滅掉以後
No one's lived by the sea

111
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:35,926
就沒有人住在海邊了
since the Indians wiped out Ballinger's Point.

112
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,056
我們就從那兒開始
I say we start there.

113
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,937
那就聽你的吧，白蘭因太太
Well, if you've decided.

114
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,380
布魯斯，那就是嗎?
Is that it, Brewster?

115
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,047
哦，太漂亮了
It's beautiful.

116
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,911
我無法想像
I tried to imagine what herlife was like

117
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:42,033
她來到這兒新世界之前的生活
before she came to the new world.

118
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,667
她丈夫為什麼要讓她一個人
Why did herhusband send heron ahead,

119
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,328
先來
alone?

120
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,253
是為了考驗她的忠誠
Was it a test ofherloyalty,

121
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,752
還是她的精神
orherspirit?

122
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:54,887
也許這是她丈夫本性的一面
Or was it in his nature to set traps

123
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:57,885
設置陷阱，希望人們能掉進來
forpeople in the hope they would fall into them?

124
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:07,806
好極了
It's perfect!

125
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:10,683
一輛車加一把好槍就能安家
With a cart and a musket, I could have a home here!

126
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:13,404
車，馬
A cart, a horse,

127
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:15,359
草叉子，犁
a pitchfork, a plow.

128
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,816
我能想出很多更好的事
I can think of better things

129
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:19,993
讓這雙漂亮的手去做 而不是讓它長繭
to do with these pretty hands than grow calluses on them.

130
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:23,363
我需要契約工，至少得兩個
I'll need indentured labor, at least two men.

131
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,958
- 這塊地需要排浪 - 你真頑固，白蘭因太太
- The land needs draining. - You are headstrong.

132
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:30,164
也許這是天生的
Perhaps it runs in the blood.

133
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:33,040
我聽說您父親就是這個脾氣
I'm told your father was too.

134
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,047
他是不是……
Is it true

135
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:39,545
真的欠你丈夫的債就拿你來頂債
he was in debt to your husband and you were the payment?

136
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:44,386
哦，這話讓你不高興了
I've said something to disturb you.

137
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:45,844
對不起
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,981
真對不起
I'm truly sorry.

139
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,225
哦，上帝，你真是太美了
God, thou art wondrous fair!

140
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:00,108
真疼
That hurt!

141
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,943
好，這會提醒你別再這麼做
Good. It'll remind you not to do it again.

142
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,908
菲絲？ 普魯頓斯？
Faith? Prudence?

143
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:24,800
你聽說了沒有？白蘭因太太有個浴盆
Did you hear Mistress Prynne has a bathing tub?

144
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:27,305
她是哪國人？法國人？
What is she, French?

145
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,531
兩先令？ 你願意出兩先令嗎？兩先令
2 Shillings. Will you bid 2 shillings?

146
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:47,488
兩個半先令，兩個半先令
2 and a half?

147
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:50,623
請注意先生們 願意出兩個半先令嗎？
Come on, gentlemen, do I have a bid for 3 shillings?

148
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,411
哦，到三先令了
3 shillings?

149
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,454
現在是三先令
3 shillings?

150
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,580
有個多出嗎
Anyone else? Anyone else?

151
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:59,799
好，成交
Going for 3 shillings. Any other bids?

152
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:03,212
三先令賣給那位先生
Sold to the gentleman for 3 shillings.

153
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,505
- 下面我們要拍賣的這個是 - 那兩個
- Next we have this other one, - Those two.

154
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,722
他們的契約還有多久？
How much time left on their indenture?

155
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,392
大約三年
About 3 years, but,

156
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,807
不過應該是你丈夫或者你父親跟我談生意不是嗎
shouldn't your husband or father be doing business with me?

157
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,140
我的錢您看不上，先生？
Is my money no good to you, sir?

158
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,435
您的錢如同陽光下的美酒，太太
Your money's as fine as wine in the sunshine, Mistress.

159
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:24,698
如果您出的價錢公道 帶紅巾的女孩就送給你了
If you buy them at a just price, I'll throw in the girl in red.

160
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,108
她是奴隸
She's a slave!

161
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:30,612
她不會說話，這是個麻煩，天生就那樣
But she don't speak, if that be a problem. Born that way.

162
00:13:32,874 --> 00:13:34,072
你就開個價吧
Name your just price.

163
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,287
您要是去林子，最好有我們陪著，太太
We'd best accompany you if your going to the forest.

164
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:18,370
不用擔心，鮑比先生 我走不遠
Don't worry Mr Bobbin. I shan't go far.

165
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,444
白蘭因太太? 白蘭因太太?
Mistress Prynne? Mistress Prynne?

166
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:24,742
白蘭因太太?
Mistress Prynne?

167
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:26,201
你在哪兒?
Where are you?

168
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,538
白蘭因太太, 你在哪兒?
Mistress Prynne, where are you?

169
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:33,248
是我找到她的
I found her.

170
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:34,628
- 不是你找到的 - 是我找到的
- You did not. - I did to.

171
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:36,633
- 你沒有 - 是我
- You did not. - I did to.

172
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:38,465
白蘭因太太,
Mistress Prynne,

173
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:42,341
難道你忘了嗎？今天是安息日
Have you forgotten it is the Sabbath?

174
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,635
當然沒有，請原諒
Of course not. Forgive me.

175
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,848
我們特意來帶你去教堂
We've come by especially to bring you to church.

176
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,357
太感謝了
Thank you, so much.

177
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:55,777
不用管我
Please, go on without me.

178
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:57,896
我馬上跟著你們去
I will follow at once.

179
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,234
抓緊吧
Make haste.

180
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,570
好的，先生
Yes, sir.

181
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:26,004
好吧，姑娘
All right, girl,

182
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:27,757
來吧
Come on.

183
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,905
使勁
Oh goodnes!

184
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:45,527
後退，後退
Back up. Back up.

185
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,737
來吧，後退
Come on now, back up.

186
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,080
快點，退後，退後
Come on. Come on. Back up.

187
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:57,827
早上好
Good morrow.

188
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,511
要我幫你嗎？
May I be of assistance?

189
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:09,717
不下來怎麼幫
Not from up there.

190
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,055
來吧，後退
Come on.

191
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,265
後退呀
Come on. Steady. Steady.

192
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,490
好像我沒法讓它聽懂我的話
I can't make this horse understand me.

193
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,321
來，讓我試試
Let me try.

194
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,743
來吧，姑娘
Come on, girl.

195
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:39,543
用力，後退
Come on, back up!

196
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:42,171
使勁，使勁
Come on, girl.

197
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,838
姑娘，使勁
Come on. Come on.

198
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:52,464
恐怕陷得太深了
I'm afraid you're in too deep.

199
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:55,517
沒辦法上來 我抬一下試試
She'll not make it. Let me try this.

200
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,846
你能把它抬出來就好了
I do hope you can get it free.

201
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:03,816
禮拜儀式我趕不上了 大家肯定在說三道四
I'm already late for the service, and everyone's talking about me.

202
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,026
不如躲得遠遠的 不在乎他們的流言蜚語
I've been away and I'm quite behind on local gossip.

203
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,854
我在波靈買了套舊房子
I bought the old Newbury place out on Ballinger's Point.

204
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,529
嗯
Then,

205
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,159
我該向你道歉
I owe you an apology.

206
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,371
我一直在冒犯你
I've been trespassing.

207
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:21,203
那有個地方，我總在那兒洗澡
There's a place at the point where I like to bath.

208
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:24,212
真的？我不會收你太高的稅
Really? Well, I shan't charge too steep a tariff.

209
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,503
使勁姑娘，往後退
Come on, girl, back up!

210
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:31,252
- 使勁 - 一,
- Back up. - One,

211
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,883
二,
Two,

212
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,597
二， 三
Two. Three.

213
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,609
恐怕這車得陷到下個安息日了
I'm afraid this cart will be stuck here until Sabbath next

214
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,355
除非我找些人來幫忙
unless I gather hands to help.

215
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,314
介意跟我騎一匹馬嗎？
Would you care to ride with me?

216
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,150
跟你坐在一起？
On your horse, with you?

217
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,447
對，除非你會騎馬
Aye, unless you can ride.

218
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,026
我會騎
I can ride.

219
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,831
好，你騎我的馬，我騎你的
You take my horse and I'll take yours.

220
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,701
有一條近路，去匯合點
There's a shortcut to the meeting house,

221
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,379
不過不太好走
but it's a difficult road.

222
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:10,915
我能行，先生
I shall manage, sir.

223
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,595
- 你肯定嗎？ - 你帶路吧
- Are you certain? - Just you lead the way.

224
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,598
駕！駕！
Come on! Come on!

225
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:46,412
駕！駕！
Come on! Come on!

226
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,598
願上帝與你同在
May God be with you.

227
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,976
我相信已經同在了
I'm sure he already is.

228
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,680
可是你不去嗎
But aren't you coming to...

229
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,417
安息日平安
Good Sabbath to ye all.

230
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,089
朋友們
Friends,

231
00:21:43,764 --> 00:21:45,970
滿懷偉大夢想的
and fellow voyagers,

232
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:48,673
同舟共濟的同事們
in the greatest of all dreams.

233
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,845
我們如同過去的 以色列人被挑選出來
We've been singled out, like Israel of old,

234
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,896
作為典範
to serve as a model.

235
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,272
所以如果能成功地
But if we are to succeed

236
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,481
建立我們新的耶路撒冷
in building our new Jerusalem,

237
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,569
我們的新的聖城
our "City on a Hill",

238
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,110
那愛的力量
then the power of love,

239
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,490
是的，上帝的愛
yea, His Divine Love,

240
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,377
我們必須萬眾一心
we must bind our hearts as one!

241
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:17,707
英國人和印第安人
English and Indian,

242
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,085
貴族和契約工 自由人和奴隸
gentry and indentured, free man and slaves,

243
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,333
將建立一個
and make of us

244
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,674
令全世界稱奇的榜樣
an example for all the world,

245
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,094
然後宣稱
to marvel at and proclaim:

246
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,635
這
"Here...

247
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,601
才是盡善盡美的標準
is the measure of perfection!

248
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,598
這
Here,

249
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,140
這是上帝的意旨
lives God's own!"

250
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,271
可我們沒有通過這一檢驗
But we are not succeeding in that test.

251
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,148
我們失敗了 為什麼？
We are failing! And why?

252
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,068
因為我們貪婪無度
Because we covet, nay,

253
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,278
我們奢求我屬於我們的東西
we lust after what is not ours.

254
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,535
我們奢求印第安人富饒的土地
Be it for the rich land of our Indian brothers,

255
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,121
奢求榮譽
be it for glory,

256
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,247
奢求利益，奢求報復
for profits or for revenge.

257
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,792
需要我說出每個人的
Need I read the secret

258
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,333
心聲嗎
of every heart?

259
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,460
好，你們需要我就說
I will if you want.

260
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,299
你們需要我就說
Yea, I will if you want.

261
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,803
我把你們心中的秘密
I will lay open the secrets

262
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,721
敞開於上帝的面前
before the eyes of God!

263
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,228
任何貪婪者都是我們敵人 上帝這樣說
What thou lusteth after is my enemy, sayeth the Lord God.

264
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,514
只有我能夠滿足你們
For only I shall consume thee,

265
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,394
也能毀滅你們
only I shall fill thee up.

266
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,523
如果你們違背我的意旨
If thou failest to heed my commandments,

267
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,697
那我的拳頭
then my fist

268
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,909
將如石頭一樣落在你們的身上
shall descend on thee like a stone!

269
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:38,665
而且我的劍會把你們切成肉泥
And thy sword shall cut thee into bloody parts,

270
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,993
甚至你們的記憶也將
and even thy memories shall be sacrificed

271
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,582
永遠隨風而去
to the winds for all time!

272
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,416
上帝保佑你們
May God bless you,

273
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:50,631
保佑每一個人
each and every one of you.

274
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:53,381
阿門
Am幯.

275
00:23:53,972 --> 00:23:54,920
阿門
Am幯.

276
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,349
阿瑟，請你允許我介紹一位新加入聖會的女士
Allow me to present a newcomer to our congregation,

277
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:00,841
羅傑·白蘭因太太
Mistress Roger Prynne.

278
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:02,428
羅傑太太？
Mistress Roger?

279
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,767
她的丈夫，一位大名鼎鼎的醫生就要來和她團聚了
Aye, her husband, a renowned physician will join her before...

280
00:24:05,984 --> 00:24:08,107
丁梅斯黛爾牧師和我已經……
Reverednd Dimmesdale and I have already...

281
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:11,440
我幫過白蘭因太太 她的馬車在森林裏陷住了
I helped when her cart got stuck in the woods.

282
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:16,197
我非常喜歡你的布道
I greatly enjoyed your sermon.

283
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:20,652
如此年輕面演講時又如此激情四射，真是難得
It's rare for a man so young to speak with such passion.

284
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,157
是的，不知道為什麼
For some reason,

285
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:26,540
我今天非常有激情
I felt most inspired today.

286
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:30,504
歡迎您和您的丈夫加入我們聖會
We welcome you and your husband to our congregation.

287
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:35,088
媽媽！媽媽！
Mother! Mother!

288
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:48,232
哦，你在這兒, 海絲特.
There you are, Hester.

289
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:50,731
見見我的朋友萊尼·莫斯，小學校長
Meet my friend, Running Moose. He's our schoolmaster.

290
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,233
想來點點心嗎，
And I'm sure you'd like some refreshment.

291
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:56,115
哦，是的 你也教英國孩子嗎，萊尼·莫斯先生
Do you teach the English children as well Mr Running Moose?

292
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:58,654
在這兒他們都叫我約翰或約翰尼
They call me John or Johnny here.

293
00:24:58,868 --> 00:25:01,952
我們盡力教，不過英國人轉的有點慢
We try our best, but the English are a bit slow-witted.

294
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:03,615
轉得慢？
Slow-witted?

295
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,165
約翰尼愛開玩笑 他是我們的第一個印第安信徒
Johnny's a bit of a jester, but he was our first praying Indian.

296
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:09,579
這位是我最好的朋友
My best friend in the colony.

297
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,618
阿瑟
Arthur,

298
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:14,960
- 這位是…… - 我們見過面了
- this is Mistress... - We've already met.

299
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:17,301
對不起
Excuse me.

300
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:25,469
這兒太像家了
So like home.

301
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:29,555
不過那些樹的後面 想必是一片野蠻之地
Yet beyond those trees I suspect a savagery,

302
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,848
充滿野性
of savage passions,

303
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,391
黑暗和未馴服
dark and untamed.

304
00:25:35,486 --> 00:25:38,405
哦，丁梅斯黛爾牧師 見過我們年輕的朋友了嗎？
Reverend Dimmesdale, have you met our young friend?

305
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:40,235
是的，我們見過了
Yes, we've met.

306
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,736
白蘭因太太和我是坐同一條船來的
Mistress Prynne and I traveled out on the same ship.

307
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:45,827
將來我要嫁給他
I'm going to marry him one day.

308
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,372
你閉上嘴，我才要嫁給他 對嗎？白蘭因太太？
No you're not, I'm going to aren't I Mistress Prynne?

309
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,916
- 嫁給誰 -當然是丁梅斯黛爾牧師了
- Marry whom? - Reverend Dimmesdale, of course!

310
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:15,348
"偉大的最終審判日簡述".
"A Short Description of the Great and Last Judgement".

311
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,852
哦, "教堂戒律論壇".
Well, "Platform for Church Discipline".

312
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:23,063
都是些小冊子
They're all tracts!

313
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:32,366
"主婦…… "
"The Goodwife's Manual... "

314
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,656
"主婦用動物飼養手冊"
for Animal Husbandry"

315
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,121
我相信我們見過了
I believe we've already met.

316
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:39,663
哦，是的，對，對，對不起 我……
Oh, yes, I... I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

317
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:41,797
不，不，不，我應該先打個招呼
I should have announced my presence.

318
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:50,260
你在看什麼
What are you reading?

319
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:53,181
- "慶祝神", 作者是…… - 約翰·密爾頓
- "Comus", it's by John - John Milton.

320
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:54,889
知道，我讀過
I know it. I've read it.

321
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:56,435
你讀過？
Have you?

322
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,973
是的，我在家不只洗洗涮涮
I'm not all counterpanes and coverlets.

323
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:01,475
只要有空我就會讀點什麼的
Every spare moment, I read.

324
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,481
我也一樣
I'm the same.

325
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:08,404
這房子裏的書我都看過 有些讀過幾遍了
I've read every book in this room. Some of them several times.

326
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:11,155
"主婦動物飼養手冊"你也讀過嗎？
Even "Manual for Animal Husbandry?"

327
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,113
讀得最高興的一本
A most exhiliarating read.

328
00:27:25,384 --> 00:27:28,966
你真的喜歡我的布道嗎？
So, did you truly enjoy my sermon?

329
00:27:29,263 --> 00:27:31,800
是的，很喜歡，非常有技巧
Yes, it was most skilful.

330
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,340
顯然社會對你非常器重
Clearly your congregation reverences you.

331
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,344
你不會喜歡,我們這是世界的邊緣 顯然達不到你們倫敦的水準
You liked it not. We don't come up to London standards.

332
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:42,017
正好相反，我被你的激情感動，我說過
To the contrary. I was moved by your passion.

333
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:44,517
而且
And?

334
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:48,319
什麼？
Well,

335
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:53,817
你的手第一次揮動的時候
when your fist struck your hand,

336
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:57,156
像把劍一樣劃過空氣
and sliced through the air like a sword,

337
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:59,454
我當時就在想
I found myself wondering

338
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:03,743
你如此激情的演講後面會藏著多大的痛苦啊
what manner of pain lay beneath such forceful oratory.

339
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,834
你真是口無遮攔，白蘭因太太
Your tongue knows no rules, Mistress Prynne.

340
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:12,760
如果真有痛苦，牧師
And if it did, Reverend,

341
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:14,596
那布道又有什麼用
what purpose would it serve?

342
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,425
我認為全知的上帝
And here I thought comprehending God

343
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,850
會成為我最大的挑戰
was to be my greatest challenge.

344
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:31,401
怎麼了，牧師？
Yes, Reverend?

345
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,613
今天早上在森林裏
This morning in the forest,

346
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:37,193
為什麼不說你已經結婚了？
why did you not say you were married?

347
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:39,487
為什麼不說你是個牧師？
Why did you not say you were a minister?

348
00:28:41,165 --> 00:28:43,371
再見, 白蘭因太太
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

349
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,886
您好, 白蘭因太太
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

350
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:59,011
您好
Good morrow.

351
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:01,098
想來杯蘋果酒嗎？
You care for a cup of cider?

352
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,843
我們好像是鄰居
We are your neighbours, it seems.

353
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,768
喜歡今天上午的布道嗎？
Did you like the sermon this morning?

354
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:10,434
我坐在那兒看到你聽得挺高興的
From where I sat it seemed it did please thee.

355
00:29:11,236 --> 00:29:13,312
我非常喜歡聽
I liked it very much.

356
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,606
我想那位年輕的牧師很……
I thought the young minister very...

357
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:16,523
英俊？
Handsome?

358
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:21,412
哈里森·希本斯
Harriet Hibbons.

359
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:25,822
來吧
Ruth?

360
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,205
你好
How do you do?

361
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:31,786
來見見幾個沒被邀請去參加
Come and meet some of the others who were not invited

362
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,336
總督家小舞會的人
to the Governer's shindig.

363
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:36,791
莎琳·肖特, 白蘭因太太
Sally Short, Mistress Prynne.

364
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:37,800
您好
How do you do?

365
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:39,886
您到的時候我在碼頭上
I was on the dock when you arrived.

366
00:29:40,098 --> 00:29:41,508
瑪麗·盧林斯
Mary Rollins.

367
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:46,804
哦，瑪麗不大喜歡說話
Mary don't like to speak much.

368
00:29:47,062 --> 00:29:50,265
擺脫了那些野蠻人的糾纏還不到半年多
She's only been free from the savages this half year.

369
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:54,231
還有莫特娜，她不信任英國人，
And Matona don't trust the English, do you dear?

370
00:29:54,903 --> 00:29:56,528
對嗎？親愛的
Mistress Prynne?

371
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:59,063
謝謝您 不，我不喝酒
Thank you, no. I never imbibe.

372
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,367
看起來，您收集了一些上好的草藥
You've gathered some fine Balm of Gilead,

373
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:08,408
牧羊人錢包，蓍草
Shepherd's Purse, yarrow.

374
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,244
您認識這些草藥
You know your plants?

375
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,495
是的，我可以背誦藥典
I do. I recite "Culpepper" by heart.

376
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:15,917
真的？
Really?

377
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:23,586
要是嚴重的燒傷應該用什麼藥醫治
Then what would you use to heal a bad burn?

378
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,179
我見過甜洋草的奇效
I've seen sweet fern work miracles,

379
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,718
不過藥典建議用黑莓和紅血松
but Culpepper suggests blackberry and red cedar.

380
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:30,888
哦，你們聽見了嗎
Well, you hear that.

381
00:30:32,982 --> 00:30:35,899
我覺得非常幸運，我丈夫有一個大書房
My husband has a very large library

382
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,603
我可以自己找書去看
and I was able to school myself.

383
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,654
喜歡我們的新聖地嗎？
How do you like our new Jerusalem?

384
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,650
你覺得太肅穆了？
Sober enough for you?

385
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,409
對
Aye,

386
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,957
太肅穆了
sober enough.

387
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:59,339
我還是想念舞會啊
What I miss is the dancing.

388
00:30:59,715 --> 00:31:00,830
舞會？
Dancing?

389
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,628
我剛來的時候
When first we came,

390
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:05,423
他們都圍著五朔柱跳舞
they'd be dancing round the maypole.

391
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:08,129
過節的時候都唱亂七八糟的歌
Feast days we'd sing bawdy songs.

392
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:10,388
人們那時候不怕出醜
People weren't afraid to play the fool.

393
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,890
我們能教會熊跳舞
We'd teach the bears to dance.

394
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,768
現在，人們的臉色越來越沉越來越木
Now days, everybody getting more and more sourfaced and ponderous.

395
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:21,392
原來的五朔柱變成了鞭打柱
And a whipping post stands where the mayppole used to be.

396
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:25,854
只有我們幾個沒有忘記怎麼笑， 對嗎？姑娘們
But there's a few of us who haven't forgotten to laugh.

397
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:32,444
能見到你們我非常高興
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.

398
00:31:32,663 --> 00:31:34,739
我很不情願告辭
I'm sorry I must take my leave,

399
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,411
可我必須走了，我可不想在夜裏陷在這個森林裏
but I don't want to be stuck in the wilds at night.

400
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:40,835
這話我聽起來很奇怪
There are things that sound to me,

401
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,372
夜間的荒野是我的領地
the wilds at night are my natural territory.

402
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:46,164
尤其在月圓之夜
Particulary when there's a full moon.

403
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:49,344
您想用咒語來嚇唬我嗎
Do you try to frighten me with this witch talk?

404
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:51,381
不, 白蘭因太太
Not so, Mistress Prynne.

405
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:56,096
可我能看到別人看不到的東西
But I can see what others cannot.

406
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:59,101
這當然是個咒語
Be a curse, to be sure,

407
00:31:59,856 --> 00:32:02,478
我能讀懂人的心
but I know the hearts of men.

408
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:06,193
我的心告訴你什麼？
And what does my heart tell you?

409
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,403
你是個漂亮女人，白蘭因太太
You're a most comely woman.

410
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:15,904
男人擔心雖然能握到少女的手
Let a man tremble who wins the hand of a maid,

411
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:20,874
可得不到它心中的全部激情
but possesses not the full passion of her heart.

412
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:27,163
我丈夫沒有什麼可怕的
My husband has nothing to fear.

413
00:32:28,176 --> 00:32:30,216
再見，希本斯太太
Good day Mistress Hibbons.

414
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,048
再見, 白蘭因太太
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

415
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,239
你好, 古蒂·高德威克.
Good day, Goody Gotwick.

416
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:01,912
我帶了這些給丁梅斯黛爾牧師
I brought these for Reverend Dimmesdale.

417
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,698
牧師可能正在工作，太太
The Reverend be occupied with his work, Missus.

418
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,790
把書放桌上，我保證他能拿到
Leave them books on the table and I'll be sure he gets them.

419
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:14,963
您好，牧師
Good morrow, Reverend.

420
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,676
您好，白蘭因太太
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

421
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,799
知道您很想讀一些新書
Knowing you hunger for new reading,

422
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:23,225
我從我丈夫書房裏拿了一些給你
I brought you some books.

423
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,850
您太客氣了
How courteous of you.

424
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:31,808
請吧
Please.

425
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,986
我很抱歉安息日那天我說了很冒昧的話
I must apologize for my forthrightness on Sabbath last.

426
00:33:43,498 --> 00:33:47,116
我從小到大為自己的心直口快挨了不少的責罵
I've earned a few reprimands for speaking too bluntly.

427
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,373
我，我也應該道歉
I owe an apology, too.

428
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,583
我不明白我為什麼會如此反感那種
I can't understand why I took such offence

429
00:33:58,262 --> 00:33:59,673
率真的評論
to such a simple comment.

430
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:04,343
我想知道
But I have wondered

431
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,429
您怎麼能夠
how you were able

432
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:10,690
對我的本性
to see so deeply

433
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:13,057
看得如此深刻
into my nature.

434
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,815
也許我是個女巫
Perhaps I'm a witch.

435
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:32,291
我不能再讓您費心了
I must be keeping you from your chores.

436
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,496
謝謝您的書，白蘭因太太
Thank you for the books.

437
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:36,752
再見
Good day.

438
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,382
我很抱歉，我手上全是墨水
I'm sorry. My hands are covered in ink.

439
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:42,883
我一直
I've been

440
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:48,058
整天都在忙活著翻譯的事
hovered over my translations all day.

441
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:49,641
翻譯？
Translations?

442
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:52,137
是的，我一直打算
Aye. I'm attempting to

443
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:56,023
把聖經翻譯成本地的印第安語言
translate the Bible into the local Indian language,

444
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:57,100
阿耳岡昆語
Algonquin.

445
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,728
雄心勃勃的計劃
What an ambitious undertaking.

446
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:03,657
可是我聽說印第安人不聽聖經的指引
But I'm told the Indians don't want to be guided by our Bible.

447
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,611
所以跟他們的戰爭不可避免
That war with them is inevitable.

448
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:08,237
有人是這樣想，但是他們錯了
Some think that way, but they're wrong.

449
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:11,540
因為印第安人不太容易被征服，
The Indians, born from a certain liberty,

450
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,659
他們天生地桀驁不馴
take not easily to bridle and bit.

451
00:35:15,462 --> 00:35:16,541
男人本色
No man should.

452
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:18,878
嗯……
Well...

453
00:35:27,098 --> 00:35:28,046
怎麼？
What?

454
00:35:30,684 --> 00:35:31,384
怎麼了？
What?

455
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,436
你往臉上塗了墨水
You keep putting ink on your face.

456
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,438
哦
Oh, I do.

457
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:46,481
知道了
There you are.

458
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,662
希望你能喜歡那些書
I do hope you enjoy the books.

459
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,832
謝謝
Thank you.

460
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,159
再見
Good day.

461
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,625
再見
Good day.

462
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:29,196
米杜芭？
Mituba?

463
00:36:31,911 --> 00:36:35,611
那只是個浴盆 不是撒旦的玩偶
'Tis only a bathing tub, not a toy of Satan.

464
00:39:37,423 --> 00:39:38,751
白蘭因太太?
Mistress Prynne?

465
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:43,625
丁梅斯黛爾牧師
Reverend Dimmesdale!

466
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:47,971
- 你嚇了我一跳 - 對不起，我不是故意的
- You frightened me. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

467
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:51,554
不，是個很大的驚喜
It's a wonderful surprise.

468
00:39:55,022 --> 00:39:56,979
- 這兒真漂亮 - 是的，也很嚇人
- It's beautiful. - Yes, and frightening.

469
00:39:58,568 --> 00:40:00,395
伊甸園不過如此
Just as Eden must have been.

470
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,362
美妙無比
So untouched.

471
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:06,481
是不是可以大聲地發誓說
Does it not cry out with it's promise,

472
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,824
這裏的一切可以重新開始
that everything can begin anew?

473
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:13,991
我把您的書帶來了
I brought back your books.

474
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,034
你不可能在四天的時間全看完了
You couldn't have read them all in four days.

475
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:20,087
哦不，看完了，大多都看了兩遍
Oh no, I did. I read most of them twice.

476
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:25,590
謝謝你
Thank you.

477
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,210
不客氣
You're welcome.

478
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:30,802
再見
Farewell.

479
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:40,186
海絲特...
Hester...

480
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,769
我不是你看到的那樣
I'm not the man I seem.

481
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:49,065
我一直都住在這裏，我的目標明確
I've lived here all my life, my purpose clear.

482
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:53,818
可現在我願意拿我的生命，我的職位，我的靈魂冒險
But now I'd risk everything, my life, my ministry, my soul

483
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,364
只為與您獨處幾分鐘
just to spend a few moments alone with you.

484
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,870
上帝幫助我，海絲特.
God help me, Hester.

485
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:01,706
我愛你
I love thee.

486
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,623
上帝幫助我，我也愛你
God help me. I love thee too.

487
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,093
哦，我們迷失方向了嗎？
Oh God. Have we lost our way?

488
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,048
不
No!

489
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,054
我夢見你向我傾吐心聲
I dreamed of thee speaking thy heart.

490
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,816
我一直在祈求一直在渴望
I have prayed for it even as I have dreaded it.

491
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:31,196
見到你之前我究竟是生還是死
Was I alive before I laid eyes on thee?

492
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,410
我們該怎麼辦
What shall we do?

493
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,621
我不知道
I know not.

494
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,460
說點什麼讓我停止
Say something to end it,

495
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,547
我無能為力
for I have not the power.

496
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,339
我也是
Nor I.

497
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,764
不，
Nay!

498
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,639
我們會因此被絞死
We could be hanged for this.

499
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,024
我置你於危險之中
I've put you in too much danger,

500
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:22,162
我一定要停止們並且走開，再也不能跟你說話了
and I must end it by walking away and never speaking with you again.

501
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,376
走吧
Go then.

502
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,545
信守你的諾言
Do as you promised.

503
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,570
整個漫長的夏天，白蘭因太太和丁梅斯黛爾牧師
Throughout the long summer, Mistress Prynne and the Reverend

504
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:32,745
想方設法避免見面
avoided each other at all costs.

505
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:37,122
白蘭因太太幾乎不鎮子上來，丁梅斯黛爾牧師躲進了荒野
Mistress Prynne rarely went to town and the Reverend escaped to the wilds

506
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:38,499
只有印第安人
with the Indians

507
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:41,287
和忠實的約翰尼與之為伴
and faithful Johnny Sassamon for company.

508
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,179
殖民地照常舉辦
And the colony organized

509
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,466
選舉日週年慶祝
it's annual election day as usual.

510
00:43:49,935 --> 00:43:52,011
沒人知道他們之中
No one the wiser that there existed among them

511
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:54,811
有兩顆心正在與愛抗爭
two hearts struggling against a love

512
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:57,728
而這種愛，卻與日俱增
that grew stronger with each passing day.

513
00:44:07,162 --> 00:44:11,160
他在說什麼
Johnny Sassamon says they've attacked the "Intrepid".

514
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,040
阿瑟?
What's he saying,

515
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:12,998
他說塔蘭泰人
Arthur?

516
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:16,000
攻擊了一艘英國船，無畏號
The Tarrantines

517
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:19,127
船上的人都被殺了
attacked an English ship, the Intrepid.

518
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:22,512
"白蘭因".
All were massacred.

519
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:37,978
"羅傑·白蘭因醫生".
"Prynne".

520
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:41,074
白蘭因太太.
"Doctor Roger Prynne".

521
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:17,730
我是作為你的牧師來這兒的
Mistress Prynne.

522
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,114
請進
I'm here as your minister.

523
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:26,367
有一支印第安人
Come in.

524
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,801
他們攻擊了我們的船
There was an attack,

525
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:42,260
他們說
an Indian attack on one of our ships.

526
00:45:44,815 --> 00:45:46,607
船上的人都被殺了
They say that,

527
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:49,604
我非常遺憾
all aboard were massacred.

528
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:01,201
給您帶來這個噩耗
I regret to be...

529
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:03,867
我該走了，請您節哀吧
the one to bring you this sad news.

530
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:07,164
你肯定沒有一個倖存者嗎？
I'll leave you to your mourning.

531
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:13,885
他們說海浪把屍體都沖走了
Are you certain none survived?

532
00:46:15,392 --> 00:46:18,392
上帝寬恕我
They say that the tide washed away the bodies.

533
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:20,520
為獲得自由我祈求了很久
God forgive me!

534
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:23,723
他的死不是你造成的，海絲特
I've prayed so long to be set free.

535
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,816
上帝……
You did not cause his death, Hester.

536
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:29,737
帶走了你丈夫
God...

537
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:31,488
是的，這是上帝對我的回復嗎？
took your husband.

538
00:46:31,702 --> 00:46:34,276
上帝是這樣做的嗎？
But was it an answer to my prayers?

539
00:46:34,497 --> 00:46:35,777
也許吧
Does He work like that?

540
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:41,667
如果在它看來沒有其它辦法
Perhaps.

541
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:46,004
讓我們在一起
If in His eyes there was no other way

542
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:48,295
我得看看法律怎麼說
we could be together.

543
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:57,847
服喪期多久，要等多長時間
I must know what the law is.

544
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,978
一個月？六個月？怎麼？
The mourning, how long must one wait?

545
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,103
但是這樣無法證明他已經絕對死亡
1 month? Six months? What?

546
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,326
我們就必須要等七年之後才能公諸於世
Where there is no absolute proof of death,

547
00:47:13,124 --> 00:47:17,287
七年?
7 years must pass before we're free to be seen in public.

548
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:19,457
是的
7 years?

549
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:22,422
祝賀你，麥特坎姆
Yes...

550
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:26,586
我們一直是敵人
Greetings, Metacomet.

551
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:28,585
但是現在我們必須團結起來
We have been

552
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,006
打擊貪婪的英國人
enemies.

553
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,711
不然他們會把我們趕下海
But now Tarrantine

554
00:53:32,931 --> 00:53:36,929
所以我們給你帶來了這個禮物
and Wampanoag must unite

555
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,094
一個英國醫生
to fight

556
00:53:40,315 --> 00:53:42,023
我們團結起來
the greedy English.

557
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,197
你說怎麼樣
before theypush us into

558
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,191
印第安人對你殘忍嗎，瑪麗？
the sea.

559
00:54:18,274 --> 00:54:20,351
我兒子死後
Were the Indians cruel to you, Mary?

560
00:54:21,611 --> 00:54:23,651
他們對我真的挺好的
After my little one died,

561
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:26,779
說句心裏話
they treated me fair and square.

562
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:29,489
謝謝
If truth be told,

563
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:32,991
我回來後你們對我的態度才算是殘忍
cruel is how you folks have treated me since I come home.

564
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:34,073
沒有哪件事不是逼著我幹的
Thank you.

565
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,706
只要一想想被野人佔有
I didn't do nothing that wasn't forced on me!

566
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:41,081
我就覺得噁心
The thought of being taken by a savage

567
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,587
野人是在馬背上做那件事的
makes me sick to my stomach.

568
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:47,047
一邊跑一邊做
Well, they do it on the backs of their horses,

569
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:49,473
海絲特，你沒事吧
ridin' across the land.

570
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:56,142
對，我沒事，我只是累了
Hester, you all right?

571
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,975
瑪麗說得對
Yes, I'm just tired.

572
00:55:04,076 --> 00:55:05,322
你管他們叫野人
Mary's right.

573
00:55:06,454 --> 00:55:08,328
我可以說說你亡夫做過的好事
You call them savages.

574
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,498
不過那是你們結婚前的事了
I could tell you a thing or two

575
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:13,579
你這個蕩婦
about your husband before he tied the knot with you.

576
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:16,036
哈洛德絕不會跟妓女有什麼瓜葛
Stupid slut!

577
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:19,540
你以為沒有？
Harold would never had nothing to do with no whore!

578
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:21,929
我甚至看見過一個滿嘴牧師聖經的牧師
You think not?

579
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:25,968
跟印第安女人鬼混
I've even seen one of your windy ministers

580
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:28,344
為了更加快活他腳下還墊著聖經
pokin' an Injun girl,

581
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:32,273
怪不得他們都說聖經能讓人昇華
standin' on a bible so he could roger her better.

582
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:35,695
我拒絕與嘲笑聖經的人呆在同一個房間裏
They always said the Scriptures should uplift you!

583
00:55:43,163 --> 00:55:46,864
好的
I refuse to be with those who would mock the Holy Book!

584
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,665
短時間內她不會回來了
Well,

585
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,046
對她來說是個解脫
she'll not be coming back soon.

586
00:55:58,263 --> 00:55:59,426
可是我們教友派認為聖經本身並不是宗教
Good riddance to her!

587
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,968
只不過是儀式和歷史而已
We Quakers believe that the Scriptures be not religion,

588
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:06,939
我同意
but only the ceremony and history of it.

589
00:56:07,148 --> 00:56:08,263
那些戒律不過是凡夫俗子的憑空想像
I agree.

590
00:56:09,192 --> 00:56:12,359
我的的精神才是真正來自天堂的聲音
For are not the laws of men but the imagination of mortals,

591
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:15,192
海絲特
and the inner spirit the true voice of Heaven?

592
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:17,322
但願你不是在暗示
Hester,

593
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:20,287
你可以直接通神吧
I pray you're not sayin' you talk directly

594
00:56:20,497 --> 00:56:21,777
你不知道
to the Deity?

595
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:23,279
只有那些拿高俸祿的聖經巨人才能通神
Don't you know that

596
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,074
小心點，孩子
only paid Bible-thumpers can do that?

597
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:28,791
不然他們會像談論我那樣談論你
Have a care, child,

598
00:56:29,424 --> 00:56:32,341
我知道有些人認為
or they'll talking of you the way they talk of me!

599
00:56:34,054 --> 00:56:37,091
這樣說是大不敬
I know some consider it blasphemous to say this,

600
00:56:37,308 --> 00:56:38,886
可從小時候起
but I do talk to God.

601
00:56:39,644 --> 00:56:41,388
我就和上帝對話，上帝也回應我
I have since I was a small child.

602
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:43,439
羅傑·白蘭因太太
And He answers me.

603
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,120
受馬塞諸塞海灣殖民地總督之命
Mistress Roger Prynne...

604
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,543
明天上午八點
by order of the Governor of Masachusetts Bay Colony,

605
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,921
你要接受眾長者和執法官的審判
you are ordered to appear before the magistrates

606
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:10,749
不得有誤
at eight tomorrow morn!

607
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,394
白蘭因太太,
Don't be tardy!

608
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:21,764
這些先生指控你離經叛道
Mistress Prynne,

609
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:25,104
你是否跟其他人說過 戒律只是凡人的想像
these gentlemen have laid a charge ofheresy againstyou.

610
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:29,189
他們稱之為異端者的聚會
Tell me how it is the laws ofmen are the imagination ofmortals?

611
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:31,235
不止是談論與野人的通姦
It is the meetings thatyou call heresy.

612
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:34,288
墮落的女人對好人大肆辱罵
Lascivious talk offornication with savages.

613
00:57:34,498 --> 00:57:37,784
沒有一個有資格的男人加以指導
Fallen women who tell lies about good citizens.

614
00:57:38,002 --> 00:57:41,169
這些女人就會信口胡言，說出大不敬的話來
This is what comes when there is no qualified man present

615
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:44,051
先生，如果女人的談話是信口胡言
to guide these women in their untutored chatterings.

616
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:47,713
那為什麼聖經會告誡我們，讓女人做女人的教師呢
If the discourse of women is untutored chattering,

617
00:57:48,348 --> 00:57:52,344
海絲特，請您停止這種聚會
why does the Bible teach that women shall be the teachers of women?

618
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:01,148
不，先生 我不會停止聚會
Hester, we ask that you cease these meetings.

619
00:58:01,528 --> 00:58:03,568
阿瑟，請加入我們
No, sirs. I'll not stop the meetings.

620
00:58:03,906 --> 00:58:05,983
我剛剛釣魚回來先生
Arthur. Please join us.

621
00:58:08,245 --> 00:58:10,450
我站在原地你會感謝我的
I've been fishing, sir..

622
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,699
- 好吧，請坐下 - 我想傳喚一位證人
You may thank me to remain where I am.

623
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:16,707
很重要嗎？
- Please be seated. - Call our first witness.

624
00:58:17,296 --> 00:58:18,625
是的，這非常重要
Is it truly of import?

625
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,129
好吧，傳你的證人
Yes, it is of great consequence.

626
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:23,758
古蒂·高德威克？
Very well, call your witness.

627
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,711
請你站起來，古蒂
Goody Gotwick?

628
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:28,763
你跟我妻子透露我了最讓人擔心的一件事情
Stand up, Goody.

629
00:58:30,436 --> 00:58:33,806
告訴我，一個女人在早晨嘔吐
You revealed to my wife something very disturbing.

630
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:37,691
意味著什麼
Tell me, what does it mean when a woman

631
00:58:38,613 --> 00:58:41,151
在早晨，而且不只是在一個地方嘔吐
vomits in the morning hours?

632
00:58:41,366 --> 00:58:45,234
我只見她吐過一次
And vomits more than once in the morning hours?

633
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:49,698
是嗎，還有
I only saw her the one time.

634
00:58:51,293 --> 00:58:52,668
古蒂·姆提爾看見她在市場吐過
Yes. And?

635
00:58:57,592 --> 00:59:00,546
你是否懷孕了，太太
Goody Mortimer saw her get sick in the market.

636
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:08,226
回答問題，女人
Are you with child?

637
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:12,226
你肚子裏是不是懷著野種
Answer your betters, woman!

638
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:17,821
是的
Do you carry a bastard child in yur womb?

639
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,662
孩子的父親是誰？
Yes.

640
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:39,420
如果說出躲在你裙子後面的男人你就無罪
Who is the father?

641
00:59:43,145 --> 00:59:46,846
我們要絞死那個私通者
You are innocent next to the one who would hide behind your skirts.

642
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,937
我不會說出他的名字，先生
We would hang that fornicator!

643
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:54,356
我告訴你他的名字
I'll not reveal the name, sir.

644
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,988
他叫撒旦
I will tell you his name!

645
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:07,246
他叫貪慾
His name is Lucifer!

646
01:00:07,547 --> 01:00:09,670
他叫十惡不赦
His name is Legion!

647
01:00:10,216 --> 01:00:12,968
先生們
His name is lust!

648
01:00:14,137 --> 01:00:15,051
你們想怎麼了斷
Gentlemen,

649
01:00:20,186 --> 01:00:21,385
你很清楚沒有法律禁止懷孕
What do you hope to accomplish?

650
01:00:21,605 --> 01:00:23,432
可有法律禁止通姦
You know there is no law against pregnancy.

651
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:25,227
只有她丈夫活著那才能叫通姦
But there is against adultery.

652
01:00:25,443 --> 01:00:28,443
你是不是懷了野種
It would only adultery if her husband were found to be alive.

653
01:00:28,652 --> 01:00:29,889
我們要絞死那通姦犯

654
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:33,132
以通姦罪把她關起來那聚會也就能阻止

655
01:00:33,617 --> 01:00:36,703
總督大人

656
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:39,494
The meetings will stop!

657
01:00:39,876 --> 01:00:40,741
如果你知道那個男人，你還會把海絲特·白蘭因關起來嗎
Governor,

658
01:00:41,878 --> 01:00:45,627
她跟你坦白過嗎
if you knew the name of this man, would you punish Hester Prynne?

659
01:00:46,717 --> 01:00:48,044
我跟他什麼都沒說過
Has she confessed the name to you?

660
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:49,837
- 真相是什麼， 阿瑟. - 他對我的私事根本不瞭解
I've confessed nothing!

661
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:52,378
- 說出真相，阿瑟 - 作為我的牧師，他將救我於你們的魔掌
- Tell us the truth, Arthur. - He knows nothing of my affairs.

662
01:00:52,597 --> 01:00:55,682
可我不怕你們的懲罰
He speaks as my pastor to spare me your harsh hand.

663
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:57,720
我敬重也很愛這個孩子的父親
But I fear not your punishments!

664
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:00,685
隨你們怎麼說 他將是我今生真正的丈夫
I love and honor the man who has fathered this child!

665
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:05,565
而我根本不可能 說出任何給他帶來傷害的話
And say what you will, he is my true husband for life,

666
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:09,779
那好吧，太太，你讓我別無選擇
and I shall furnish no information which might cause him harm.

667
01:01:11,202 --> 01:01:13,776
你被捕了
Very well, you leave me no choice.

668
01:01:14,248 --> 01:01:15,576
你為什麼要抓她
You're under arrest.

669
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:34,636
讓我跟這女人單獨呆一會兒
Is this your new Jerusalem?

670
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:37,848
- 我肯定能讓她說出他的名字 - 很好，阿瑟，你會有這個機會，我保證
Let me have a moment alone with the woman.

671
01:01:38,067 --> 01:01:41,935
先生們
- I can draw the name from her. - You shall have your chance.

672
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:44,815
我考慮過所有意見之後
Gentlemen.

673
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:47,777
我決定必須允許阿瑟 單獨跟白蘭因太太談談
I've considered all the arguments

674
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:51,659
海絲特·白蘭因
and decided Arthur is allowed to speak to Mistress Prynne alone.

675
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,002
把你的手放在聖經上
Hester Prynne,

676
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:06,179
我們禱告
place your hand on the Good Book.

677
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,475
我們禱告
Let us pray.

678
01:02:12,147 --> 01:02:13,392
你為什麼不告訴我
Let us pray.

679
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:20,990
我害怕
Why did you not tell me?

680
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:24,650
我以為拚命幹活就能流產
I was afraid.

681
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,745
我必須說出真相
I thought if I worked hard, I would miscarry.

682
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:39,094
不，不能說
I must go to Bellingham with the truth.

683
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:40,674
對他們來說你是聖徒 他們會因為背叛而絞死你
No, you must not!

684
01:02:41,473 --> 01:02:44,474
那就絞死我吧 也比讓你代我受過要好
You are a saint to these people! They'll hang you for betraying them!

685
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:47,258
可他們沒有關我的理由
I prefer to hang, than allow you to suffer for me.

686
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,144
- 等他們吵累了就會把我放出去的 - 我瞭解斯頓赫爾
They've no case against me!

687
01:02:49,355 --> 01:02:52,689
你在挑戰他
- When they tire, they'll release me. - I know Stonehall.

688
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:54,646
他不會放過你
You've challenged him,

689
01:02:55,154 --> 01:02:56,981
除非你變得恭順並承認自己有罪
and he'll not release you

690
01:02:57,198 --> 01:02:59,487
你認為我們有罪嗎？
until you are humbled and have recanted your sins.

691
01:03:01,203 --> 01:03:02,781
我知道沒有
Do you believe we've sinned?

692
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:09,707
我們相愛本身就是一種昇華 我們感覺如此美妙難道你忘了嗎
I know not.

693
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,546
我沒有忘
What happen between us had a consecration. Have you forgotten?

694
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:16,173
阿瑟，我知道你想說出來
I've not forgotten!

695
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:23,933
你人本性決定你想說出真相
Arthur, I know you want to speak out.

696
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,268
可你那樣會毀掉自己
Your nature cries out for it.

697
01:03:27,524 --> 01:03:29,517
也會剝奪我反抗這種偽善的權利
But you risk your own ruin and deny me

698
01:03:29,735 --> 01:03:32,309
士兵
my right to stand up to this hypocrisy.

699
01:03:32,864 --> 01:03:33,694
如果我想跟你說話
Soldier!

700
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,294
我會把手絹繫在這個窗戶上
If I need you to speak,

701
01:03:48,214 --> 01:03:50,539
我愛你，海絲特
I'll tie this handkerchief from the window.

702
01:03:54,304 --> 01:03:55,680
可你的勇氣讓我害怕
I love thee woman,

703
01:03:58,476 --> 01:04:00,469
我會照你說的做
but your strength frightens me.

704
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:05,357
阿門
I'll do what you ask.

705
01:04:12,117 --> 01:04:12,982
願上帝與你同在
Amen.

706
01:04:22,796 --> 01:04:24,588
我相信他已經同在了
God be with you.

707
01:04:27,968 --> 01:04:29,760
先生們
I'm sure he already is.

708
01:04:41,526 --> 01:04:42,557
白蘭因太太在這裏關了五個月
Gentlemen,

709
01:04:42,986 --> 01:04:45,855
而沒有受到任何合法的審判，為什麼？
Mistress Prynne has been there more than 5 months

710
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:48,064
甚至連落後的普利毛斯人都指責 這樣對待她是野蠻行為
without any legal justification.

711
01:04:48,282 --> 01:04:51,901
我也很想把她釋放，阿瑟 這件事讓我在家裏不得安生
Even in Plymouth they regard this as barbaric!

712
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,454
現在是人們看著我們 一個星期接一個星期找她談
I'd like to free her. At home, I have no peace on this.

713
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:59,083
卻只能無功而返
But the people see us go to her week after week, caps in hand,

714
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,454
這個女人不認罪，不懺悔
only to be turned away.

715
01:05:01,673 --> 01:05:03,547
沒有當眾鞭打她已經算是她幸運了
The woman is unrepentant!

716
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:06,676
我很奇怪，奇夫牧師. 你剛來時是很理智的
She's fortunate we haven't beaten her publicly!

717
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:10,138
我來這兒，先生 是要找到一種有效的秩序
I'm surprised at you Reverend. You came here a man of reason.

718
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:14,765
可我找到的卻是虛偽的巢穴
I came here expecting some semblance of order.

719
01:05:15,022 --> 01:05:17,774
先生，如果你不阻止這種異端
Instead I find a den of fractiousness!

720
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:20,851
我和我妻子決定返回英國
Sir, if you do not stem this dissent,

721
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:24,069
而且帶走所有的教區居民
my wife and I will return to England.

722
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:27,489
她只要表示
And take our parishioners!

723
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:30,575
一點點悔悟就可以了
If only she would give us

724
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,699
如果我父親能做決定
a small sign of contrition.

725
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:39,248
他會把把我的身世透露出來 並瞭解這件事
Ifit had been up to him, my father,

726
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:42,255
- 讓開 - 可是為了我母親的意願，他不能這樣做
he would have ended it and revealed the truth ofmy origins.

727
01:05:43,555 --> 01:05:46,341
- 不許探視 - 簡直可惡之極
But bound by my mother's wish, he could not.

728
01:05:46,462 --> 01:05:48,708
他每天都去看媽媽，每天都被拒絕

729
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:53,262
每當他在窗戶上看到那標記時
He went every day to see her and was refused.

730
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:58,270
他都覺得他應該站出來，說出真相
His eye everon that window forhersign that it was time

731
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:01,276
白蘭因反覆無常的本性
to come forward with the truth.

732
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:11,385
在英國可曾出現過
Had there been flashes ofPrynne's unstable nature before

733
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:12,712
沒有人知道
in England?

734
01:08:13,558 --> 01:08:14,673
現在他雖然離開了清教徒社會
No one knows.

735
01:08:18,356 --> 01:08:20,847
可他還是受困於日漸增多的清規戒律中
But now, free from Puritan society,

736
01:08:21,109 --> 01:08:25,023
這些戒律強大得連印第安人都覺得可怕
he was increasingly seized by spirits so powerful

737
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,861
他的身體裏一定有幽靈
they were terrifying even to the Indians.

738
01:08:37,253 --> 01:08:39,958
他會給我們帶來厄運
He has a ghost in him.

739
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:42,127
送他回家吧

740
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:43,127
He'll bring us bad luck.

741
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:44,586
寬恕我，上帝
Send him home.

742
01:08:48,097 --> 01:08:49,176
我已經背離了你，我的聖父
Forgive me, Lord,

743
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:53,513
請寬恕我
forI have turned from my Heavenly Father.

744
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:55,809
帶我重回你的懷抱
Forgive me.

745
01:08:57,775 --> 01:09:00,183
可憐的孩子，他們怎麼能不管你
Lord, bring me back to thy bosom.

746
01:09:02,656 --> 01:09:06,488
我很高興你在這兒
God's teeth, child! How could they leave you thus?

747
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:08,445
六個月都沒有人來看我
I'm so glad you're here!

748
01:09:08,954 --> 01:09:11,363
我們想來，親愛的 可他們不讓進來
6 months and not one visitor.

749
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:14,621
你的奴隸每天都來 現在，疼得厲害嗎？
Some of us came, my dear, but we were turned away.

750
01:09:14,836 --> 01:09:18,171
- 從沒停過 - 來吧
Your slave came every day. How quick are the pains?

751
01:09:18,382 --> 01:09:20,174
喝一口這個
- They're not stopping. - Here.

752
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:22,301
我告訴你，這次別拒絕我的蘋果酒
Take a sip of this.

753
01:09:23,012 --> 01:09:25,634
丁梅斯黛爾牧師想盡了方法想把你弄出去
I wager you won't refuse my cider this time.

754
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:30,603
- 還要嗎？ - 是的
Rvd. Dimmesdale tried always to get you freed.

755
01:09:30,938 --> 01:09:32,219
哦，親愛的，來吧，深呼吸 深呼吸
- Another? - Yes.

756
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,857
我在這兒，抓緊我，很好，姑娘
All right, breathe deep. Breathe deep.

757
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:38,312
放鬆，放鬆
Hold on to me! Good girl!

758
01:09:38,531 --> 01:09:40,571
讓我看看，讓我看看
Easy, easy.

759
01:09:40,783 --> 01:09:42,905
好的好的，一切都好
Let me see.

760
01:09:43,243 --> 01:09:46,612
快了，我親愛的，是時候了
All's well. All's well. It's close.

761
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:49,536
你坐起來
It's very close. Come, my dear. It's time.

762
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:50,700
對，好姑娘
Up you sit.

763
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:52,704
下來一點
Good girl. There.

764
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,878
這個孩子生得真是時候
Move down a little. Good.

765
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:58,506
我們可有事做了
This child is ready to be born.

766
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,214
好的
We've work to do!

767
01:10:01,014 --> 01:10:01,844
我沒想到他們關我這麼久
There.

768
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:05,473
讓我說
How could they keep me here so long?

769
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,011
Well, I'll say this,

770
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,011
你一定有鋼鐵般的意志

771
01:10:09,565 --> 01:10:12,057
要是換了男人 他們早就死了
you must have a will of iron.

772
01:10:12,485 --> 01:10:15,820
好的，親愛的，現在
When you take on the men, it leads to death.

773
01:10:17,074 --> 01:10:20,360
深呼吸，深呼吸
All right, my dear. Chin down and bear down hard!

774
01:10:20,578 --> 01:10:23,069
再使勁，再來
More and harder!

775
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:26,160
好，好，對
Harder! Good!

776
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:29,870
放鬆
Good girl. That's it.

777
01:10:30,172 --> 01:10:31,715
放鬆
Easy.

778
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,711
好，好，放鬆
Easy.

779
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:35,635
上帝是在懲罰我
Good. Easy.

780
01:10:41,144 --> 01:10:43,764
說真的，懲罰你
Are you sure God's not punishing me?

781
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:46,554
是要給你個孩子
To be sure he's punishing you.

782
01:10:46,815 --> 01:10:48,524
用勁，再來
He be giving you a child!.

783
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:51,816
哦，頭出來了
Now. Gently.

784
01:10:52,072 --> 01:10:53,981
看見了，看見了
Now the head is coming.

785
01:10:54,575 --> 01:10:56,200
慢點，肩膀出來了
The head is through.

786
01:10:56,410 --> 01:10:58,450
放鬆，放鬆
Just a little more. Easy.

787
01:10:58,872 --> 01:11:00,746
是個丫頭
Easy. Easy.

788
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,382
上帝，謝謝你
She'd here!

789
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:11,841
是的
Oh, thank you, God!

790
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:19,724
小寶貝，是的
Yes!

791
01:11:22,022 --> 01:11:24,265
是的
Little Pearl. Yes!

792
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:25,516
我的，她在這兒
Yes!

793
01:11:26,444 --> 01:11:27,987
她在這兒
Harriet, she's here!

794
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:30,152
坐下吧，太太
She's here.

795
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,724
開始吧，牧師.
Sit there, Mistress.

796
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:03,067
我讓他們去給你和孩子拿乾淨的衣服
Proceed, Reverend.

797
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:21,080
我帶來了好消息
I'll have them fetch fresh clothes for you and the babe.

798
01:12:35,732 --> 01:12:37,061
我已經說服了總督
I bring good news.

799
01:12:37,776 --> 01:12:40,529
將你釋放
I've prevailed upon the Governor.

800
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,731
不過根據法律
You are to be freed.

801
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:48,244
你將會被送到絞刑架
But by law...

802
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:51,997
接受審訊
you'll be brought to the scaffold

803
01:12:53,418 --> 01:12:54,794
海絲特
for reprimand.

804
01:12:57,757 --> 01:12:58,587
不管他們說什麼
Hester.

805
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:01,050
求你
Whatever is said,

806
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:03,045
假裝誠心悔恨
please,

807
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:06,345
就算不為我，也要為了孩子
be as contrite as your conscience permits.

808
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:08,598
求你不要再激怒他們 有時
If not for my sake, for the babe's.

809
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:12,558
我來給這個孩子做洗禮
I beg you, don't anger them further!

810
01:13:18,322 --> 01:13:20,481
我快著急死了
I've come to baptize the babe.

811
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:43,431
我每天都來
I've died not seeing you.

812
01:13:45,394 --> 01:13:46,888
我給這個孩子做洗禮
I came every day.

813
01:14:24,898 --> 01:14:26,606
珠兒
I baptize this child,

814
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:31,401
珠兒？
Pearl.

815
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:34,488
以聖父
Pearl.

816
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:44,452
聖子
In the name of the Father,

817
01:14:46,755 --> 01:14:47,835
聖靈的名義
and the son,

818
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:52,343
願上帝祝福你
and the Holy Ghost.

819
01:14:55,683 --> 01:14:57,391
關愛你
May the Lord bless thee,

820
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,598
保佑你
and care for thee,

821
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:04,024
阿門
and watch over thee.

822
01:15:08,489 --> 01:15:09,438
釋放這個女人
Amen.

823
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:18,994
就等於慫恿每一個妻子
Freeing this woman

824
01:15:19,627 --> 01:15:22,628
背叛她的丈夫
is an invitation to every wife

825
01:15:22,838 --> 01:15:24,831
每一個孩子背叛他的父母
to defy her husband.

826
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:27,084
不，應該把她釋放
Every child it's parent!

827
01:15:27,344 --> 01:15:29,337
什麼？
No, she should be released.

828
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:30,427
不要把她關進監獄
What?

829
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:32,759
而要把監獄建在她的心裏
You don't put her in prison,

830
01:15:32,976 --> 01:15:35,550
這樣每次大家看她的時候
you put the prison in her.

831
01:15:35,771 --> 01:15:37,811
她的靈魂將重新打上罪惡的烙印
So each time someone sees her,

832
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:41,018
真是個好主意，親愛的
her sin will be marked into her soul afresh.

833
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:52,944
以國王的名義讓步
Cunningly contrived, my dear.

834
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,245
我們祝福馬塞諸塞海岸殖民地裏
Make way in the King's name.

835
01:15:58,796 --> 01:16:02,082
不公正的行為被暴露在陽光下
A blessing on the righteous Colony of Massachusetts,

836
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:06,092
今天在場的人都知道
where iniquity is dragged into the sunlight!

837
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:09,677
羅傑·白蘭因太太
Know ye

838
01:16:09,892 --> 01:16:12,384
一直因為其背叛和通姦行為
that Mistress Roger Prynne

839
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:15,227
而受懲罰
has been ordered

840
01:16:15,482 --> 01:16:19,101
如果以後能確定
to bear punishment for fornication and adultery.

841
01:16:22,949 --> 01:16:25,522
她的丈夫還活著
If it be determined later

842
01:16:25,744 --> 01:16:27,618
那她還將受到更加嚴厲的懲罰
that her husband be still alive,

843
01:16:27,829 --> 01:16:30,665
也就是接受絞刑至死
she may face a most severe penalty,

844
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:33,793
上帝保佑
which is to be hanged by the neck until dead.

845
01:16:34,087 --> 01:16:37,920
尊敬的總督閣下簽署
Pray, silence, for his Excellency,

846
01:16:38,384 --> 01:16:39,413
海絲特·白蘭因,
the Governor.

847
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,711
雖然你沒有表現出真誠
Hester Prynne,

848
01:16:42,887 --> 01:16:45,094
不過你仍然有機會悔過
though you show no modesty in you apparel,

849
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,514
悔過吧，海絲特
yet you have a chance, still, to repent your sins.

850
01:16:50,813 --> 01:16:52,806
孩子，你是否相信你犯了罪
Yes, Hester, repent!

851
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,238
我相信你們認為我有罪
Child, don't you believe you have sinned?

852
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,320
可誰知道上帝是不是認同你們
I believe I have sinned in your eyes,

853
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:07,785
婦人
but who is to know if God shares your views?

854
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,156
你不要超越上天仁慈的界限
Woman,

855
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:12,332
丁梅斯黛爾牧師 你是她的牧師
transgress not the limits of Heaven's mercy!

856
01:17:12,964 --> 01:17:16,381
跟她談談
Reverend Dimmesdale, you are her pastor.

857
01:17:17,094 --> 01:17:19,419
為了我們大家，開導她 別讓她冥頑不化
Speak to her for all our sakes!

858
01:17:20,222 --> 01:17:23,841
跟她談談，牧師
Soften her, her hardness her obstinacy!

859
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:30,024
跟她談談吧，我的兄弟
Listen to the Reverend!

860
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:31,894
勸她說出真相
Speak to the woman, my brother.

861
01:17:32,236 --> 01:17:34,810
海絲特·白蘭因,
Exalt her to confess the truth!

862
01:17:40,745 --> 01:17:42,369
聽見這些好人的話了嗎
Hester Prynne,

863
01:17:44,374 --> 01:17:46,700
你可以看出我承擔了多大的責任
you hear what these good men say,

864
01:17:47,378 --> 01:17:50,747
為了你靈魂的安寧
and see the accountablity under which I labor.

865
01:17:53,051 --> 01:17:55,459
我責令你
For your soul's peace,

866
01:17:57,682 --> 01:17:59,555
說出另一個
I charge thee

867
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,099
有罪者的名字
speak out the name

868
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,554
你不要因為
of your fellow sinner.

869
01:18:10,154 --> 01:18:11,981
錯誤的同情和關愛而保持沉默了
Be not silent

870
01:18:12,198 --> 01:18:15,650
相信我，如果那個人站出來
for some mistaken pity or tenderness for him.

871
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,491
與你並肩站在這裏受辱
For believe me, if he could

872
01:18:18,705 --> 01:18:21,707
要好過讓他
step down and stand beside you on your pedestal of shame,

873
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:23,752
帶著一顆愧疚之心悔恨終生
it would be better than to

874
01:18:25,046 --> 01:18:27,798
你的沉默能夠為他做什麼
carry a guilty heart through life.

875
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,638
你是想誘惑他
What can your silence do for him,

876
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:37,843
還是想強迫他
except to tempt him?

877
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:40,474
背負另一個罪名
And compel him

878
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,554
說吧
to add hypocrisy to sin?

879
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:48,780
她不肯說
Speak.

880
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:06,168
以上帝的名義，絞死他
She will not speak.

881
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:09,090
絞死他
In the name of the Lord, name him!

882
01:19:09,764 --> 01:19:11,175
- 快說吧 - 他是誰
Name him!

883
01:19:14,436 --> 01:19:16,393
那個男人是誰
- His name! - What is his name?

884
01:19:16,605 --> 01:19:18,396
那好吧
Who might he be?

885
01:19:31,873 --> 01:19:33,332
執士
Very well.

886
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:34,781
太太，如果你不說出他的名字
Beadle!

887
01:19:35,502 --> 01:19:37,080
你必須在胸前掛上
Mistress, if you do not speak out

888
01:19:37,296 --> 01:19:39,868
這個罪惡的通姦的標記
his name, wear upon your bodice

889
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:43,215
這是最後一次
this symbol of your sinful fornication.

890
01:19:56,942 --> 01:19:57,724
警告
Heed not this

891
01:19:57,984 --> 01:19:59,693
你今天起你將成為一個賤民
final warning,

892
01:19:59,945 --> 01:20:02,234
被這個鎮子上的每個男人 女人，和孩子
and you will be a pariah,

893
01:20:02,573 --> 01:20:05,528
驅逐，隔離和斥責
cut off, shunned and reviled by every man,

894
01:20:05,744 --> 01:20:08,116
你們等什麼 掛上吧
woman and child in this town!

895
01:20:13,587 --> 01:20:16,208
它代表的不是我的恥辱而是你們的
Why do you wait? Put it on!

896
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:19,543
你想幹什麼
It is not a badge of my shame, but your own!

897
01:21:13,196 --> 01:21:14,441
難道我變了很多嗎，親愛的
What do you want?

898
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:18,317
甚至在我死而復生之後你還要殺死我
Have I changed so much, my beloved,

899
01:21:18,577 --> 01:21:22,160
羅傑？
that you would slay me as I resurrect myself from the dead?

900
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:29,209
海絲特.
Roger?

901
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,316
難道我對你不夠好嗎？
Hester.

902
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,367
難道我不愛你嗎？
Was I ever unkind to you?

903
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,703
難道我不是把你置於所有女人之上？
Did I not love thee?

904
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,544
神聖的誓言沒有把你交給我？
Did I not see thee above all womanhood?

905
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:09,927
還是這塊新土地把你變成了異教徒？
Are you not bound to me by sacred oath?

906
01:22:10,553 --> 01:22:13,887
躺到我們的床上，我的妻子
Or has this new land turned thee into a heathen?

907
01:22:20,606 --> 01:22:23,524
為你的罪禱告吧，海絲特·白蘭因.
Lay our bed will thou, wife.

908
01:22:49,263 --> 01:22:51,755
祈求上帝寬恕你的不忠
Pray for thy sins, Hester Prynne.

909
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:54,383
祈禱，我會把你洗得潔白如雪
Beg the Lord to forgive thy corruption.

910
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:58,683
是的親愛的，潔白如雪
Pray and I'll wash thee as white as snow.

911
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:04,608
潔白如雪
White as snow, my love.

912
01:23:04,948 --> 01:23:06,573
潔白如雪
White as snow.

913
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:13,784
阿瑟?
White as snow.

914
01:23:57,716 --> 01:23:58,498
海絲特?
Arthur?

915
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:07,050
感謝上帝你在這兒
Hester?

916
01:24:07,269 --> 01:24:08,929
- 為什麼要冒這個險 - 我給你報警
Thank God you're here!

917
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:12,309
我丈夫，羅傑，他還活著
- Why are you taking this risk? - I had to warn you.

918
01:24:12,525 --> 01:24:14,980
啊，親愛的上帝
My husband is alive.

919
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,732
他還活著？
Dear God!

920
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,481
我們肯定會被絞死
Alive?

921
01:24:22,661 --> 01:24:24,868
他為什麼會在此刻現身 難道他是上帝派來
Now we'll hang for certain.

922
01:24:25,498 --> 01:24:29,164
懲罰我們的黑暗使者
Why would he show up at this moment if he wasn't God's dark messenger,

923
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:31,205
阿瑟，你必須離開這兒
sent to punish us.

924
01:24:32,256 --> 01:24:34,746
我不忍心看到你生活在他
Arthur, you must leave without us.

925
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:38,086
警惕的目光之下
I cannot bear to see you trapped here,

926
01:24:38,303 --> 01:24:40,177
海絲特，我不能離開 我必須留下來照看你和珠兒
under his watchful eye forever.

927
01:24:40,431 --> 01:24:44,180
不，你不瞭解他
Hester, I must stay and watch over you and Pearl.

928
01:24:44,394 --> 01:24:46,304
他會等我們出賣對方
No. You don't know him.

929
01:24:46,772 --> 01:24:49,608
哪怕是一個輕柔的眼神或是細微的手勢
He'll wait for us to betray each other

930
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:52,225
求你了，你必須走
with the slightest glance or the merest gesture.

931
01:24:52,529 --> 01:24:53,692
這是上帝的懲罰
Please. You must go!

932
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:58,193
因為我們曾想擺脫他的意旨
This God's punishment,

933
01:24:59,578 --> 01:25:02,330
我不會離開你的，海絲特.
because we tried to run from His Will.

934
01:25:18,224 --> 01:25:21,142
但願上帝與你同在
I will not say farewell, Hester.

935
01:25:21,937 --> 01:25:24,689
我也與你同在
Pray God watch over you.

936
01:25:26,818 --> 01:25:28,478
每晚替我親吻珠兒
And so will I.

937
01:25:31,741 --> 01:25:34,824
容易看出一部分像媽媽
Kiss Pearl for me each night.

938
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,154
不知道是不是超越了哲人的研究
'Tis easy to see the mother's part in her.

939
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,732
從這孩子的性格和外貌來看
Is it beyond research, I wonder,

940
01:26:10,952 --> 01:26:14,237
大概猜得出她的父親是誰
to analyze her nature, and from it's make and mold,

941
01:26:14,497 --> 01:26:17,534
你有什麼打算，先生
give a shrewd guess as to the father?

942
01:26:18,877 --> 01:26:20,621
哦，親愛的 我不指望你能很快回心轉意
What are your expectations?

943
01:26:20,921 --> 01:26:24,670
但我希望總有一天 你會重新把我
I do not expect your heart to return to you quickly.

944
01:26:25,218 --> 01:26:28,967
放進你的心裏
But I hope one day you will draw me again

945
01:26:29,223 --> 01:26:30,219
愛讓我把心向另一個人敞開
into your heart.

946
01:26:31,475 --> 01:26:34,724
別亂說話，太太
Love has forced me to open my heart to another.

947
01:26:34,936 --> 01:26:36,845
那個教你說這些話的影子情人
Watch your tongue, woman!

948
01:26:37,063 --> 01:26:40,148
他在哪兒？
'Tis this phantom lover who puts these words into your mouth1

949
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:41,225
他嘴角的溫潤
Where is he?

950
01:26:41,527 --> 01:26:42,441
仍然停留在你的嘴唇 或者是你的胸前
Is his kiss

951
01:26:42,653 --> 01:26:44,693
- 我想知道 - 我坐了六個月冰冷的牢房
still wet on your lips, on your breast?

952
01:26:44,948 --> 01:26:48,115
也沒有告訴那些人
- I demand to know! - If I spent 6 months in a cold jail,

953
01:26:48,327 --> 01:26:50,403
你憑什麼認為我會跟你說
and did not tell these iron men,

954
01:26:50,621 --> 01:26:52,365
這些審判讓我更堅強了，先生
what makes you think I'll tell you now?

955
01:26:52,624 --> 01:26:55,411
我不再是你剛娶的那個小姑娘了
These trials have made me strong!

956
01:26:55,626 --> 01:26:58,200
你為什麼不馬上公開宣佈把我休掉
And I am not the child you married!

957
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:02,007
不，不
Why not announce yourself openly and cast me off at once.

958
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,083
我不想對你報復，孩子
No, no.

959
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,591
可拆散我們的人還活著
I seek no vengeance against you.

960
01:27:06,807 --> 01:27:10,141
他的外衣上沒有一個
But the man lives who wronged us both.

961
01:27:11,479 --> 01:27:13,104
揭露他醜行的字
He bears no letter of infamy

962
01:27:13,355 --> 01:27:14,351
可我能夠看到他心上的字
wrought into his garment.

963
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:18,191
敢把我的真實身份透露給他一個字
But I shall read it on his heart.

964
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:22,193
你們就會被絞死
Breathe one word to him of my true identity,

965
01:27:22,449 --> 01:27:24,988
如果你們愚蠢地想逃走
and you will both hang.

966
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:27,576
那你們很快就會被發現的
If you try to escape,

967
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,070
很好
you will be easily found.

968
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,414
從野蠻人那裏
Easily!

969
01:27:33,044 --> 01:27:34,835
我學會了耐心
From the savages

970
01:27:35,046 --> 01:27:37,584
海絲特·白蘭因.
I have learned patience,

971
01:27:38,216 --> 01:27:39,676
古蒂·高德威克，謝謝
Hester Prynne.

972
01:28:18,513 --> 01:28:20,506
丁梅斯黛爾牧師牧師 允許我來介紹一位新房客
Goody Gotwick, thank you.

973
01:28:33,905 --> 01:28:37,773
奇林
Reverend, allow me to introduce our newest boarder,

974
01:28:37,993 --> 01:28:38,989
- 奇林·沃爾斯 - 奇林·沃爾斯
Doctor Chilling...

975
01:28:39,203 --> 01:28:41,196
你好，牧師
- Chillingworth. - Chillingworth.

976
01:28:42,874 --> 01:28:44,037
你好，先生.
Good day, man.

977
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,532
為什麼要來我們的殖民地，先生
Good day, sir.

978
01:28:49,173 --> 01:28:52,589
我是醫生，先生 我可以為大家
What brings you to our colony, sir?

979
01:28:52,968 --> 01:28:56,468
祛除疾病
I'm a physician, sir. I would cleanse the ills

980
01:28:56,681 --> 01:28:58,425
我說的有什麼不對嗎？
of the community.

981
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,639
不
Have I said something strange?

982
01:29:07,069 --> 01:29:07,982
只是我很好奇
No.

983
01:29:10,114 --> 01:29:11,822
我們一直祈求一位醫術高明的醫生
I'm amazed.

984
01:29:13,867 --> 01:29:17,866
我看你正把聖經譯成阿爾岡昆語
We have prayed for a skilled physician.

985
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:23,622
那是最難懂的一種語言
I see you are translating the Bible into Algonquin.

986
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,758
我希望能夠幫上忙，丁梅斯黛爾牧師
A most difficult tongue to master.

987
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,916
我的阿爾岡昆語很流利
If I can be of help, Reverend.

988
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:36,549
- 流利？ - 是的
I am fluent in Algonquin.

989
01:29:37,686 --> 01:29:39,643
哦，是的，我做過塔蘭泰人的俘虜
- Fluent? - Yes.

990
01:29:40,022 --> 01:29:42,430
只要我說的不對，他們就打我
I was a prisoner of the Tarrantine.

991
01:29:42,734 --> 01:29:44,525
所以我學得突飛猛進
When I spoke improperly, I was whipped.

992
01:29:44,736 --> 01:29:47,406
你是怎麼被抓住的
I learned quite rapidly.

993
01:29:49,241 --> 01:29:51,199
我在弗吉尼亞農場工作的時候 他們來了
How were you captured?

994
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,371
殺了我的妻子愛萊諾 願她的靈魂安息
I was working my farm in Virginia. They came,

995
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:59,869
和我尚未長大的兒子
killed my wife, Eleanor, God rest her soul,

996
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:01,997
然後把我作為俘虜賣掉
and our infant son,

997
01:30:02,632 --> 01:30:05,253
很奇怪你並沒有過多的
and sold me into captivity.

998
01:30:09,306 --> 01:30:12,390
痛苦和失望
It's a wonder you're not consumed

999
01:30:12,768 --> 01:30:14,559
不，不，說實話，先生 我欠印弟安人的債
with bitterness and despair.

1000
01:30:15,396 --> 01:30:18,148
有人說他們是野蠻人 可我發現真正的野蠻人
No, no. In truth, I am indebted to the Indians.

1001
01:30:18,441 --> 01:30:22,060
卻在別的地方
Some say they are savages, but true savagery,

1002
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:24,859
羅傑·白蘭因太太
I find resides elsewhere.

1003
01:30:35,501 --> 01:30:37,376
白蘭因太太.
Mistress Roger Prynne.

1004
01:30:38,465 --> 01:30:39,840
職責，孩子

1005
01:30:39,465 --> 01:30:40,840
Mistress Prynne.

1006
01:30:40,495 --> 01:30:41,818
你的職責是什麼，孩子

1007
01:30:46,306 --> 01:30:48,346
跟著你去每一個公共場所，太太
And what is your duty, boy?

1008
01:30:48,684 --> 01:30:51,353
很好，至少他們會給我讓路
Follow you around, Mistress.

1009
01:30:51,603 --> 01:30:54,142
滾回去，賤人
Well, at least they'll make a path for me.

1010
01:31:22,723 --> 01:31:23,719
上帝會懲罰你的，罪人
Whore!

1011
01:31:23,933 --> 01:31:25,973
賤人
God will punish you, sinner!

1012
01:31:26,352 --> 01:31:27,598
你在這兒不受歡迎
Jezebel!

1013
01:31:29,064 --> 01:31:31,185
走吧，海絲特·白蘭因!
You're not welcome here!

1014
01:31:31,774 --> 01:31:34,146
我要買肥皂，給我三塊
Be gone, Hester Prynne!

1015
01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:45,237
雖然我父親身上沒掛著紅字
Soap, please. Three pieces.

1016
01:32:12,446 --> 01:32:15,696
可他自己的紅字就印在他的靈魂上
Although he wore no outward symbol ofhis shame,

1017
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:19,818
分離的痛苦影響了大家.
my father wore his own scarlet letteron the bosom ofhis soul.

1018
01:32:21,415 --> 01:32:24,950
我是一個非常難纏的孩子
The pain of their separation must have affected us all.

1019
01:32:25,169 --> 01:32:27,839
為解相思之苦
I was a troublesome child.

1020
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:31,004
父親帶著約翰尼去野外以求擺脫孤獨
My father ached formy mother,

1021
01:32:31,258 --> 01:32:34,628
他們想在英國人和印第安人之間
and filled his loneliness in the wilds with Johnny.

1022
01:32:34,846 --> 01:32:36,305
架起一座橋樑
They struggled

1023
01:32:36,514 --> 01:32:38,258
並且努力維護著這個夢想
to keep alive their  dream

1024
01:32:38,517 --> 01:32:39,976
約翰尼
of building a bridge between English and Indian.

1025
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:42,934
他們離鎮子為什麼這麼近
Johnny,

1026
01:32:44,065 --> 01:32:46,189
他們說，我們的人都睡了
why are they so close to town?

1027
01:32:46,818 --> 01:32:49,820
所以他們必須保持清醒
They say our people have fallen asleep.

1028
01:32:50,489 --> 01:32:53,110
我很擔心
So they must remain awake for all of us.

1029
01:32:55,953 --> 01:32:57,199
會有戰爭嗎，阿瑟
I'm worried.

1030
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:59,700
偉大的夢想破滅了，是嗎？
Is war coming?

1031
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,918
他說的對
The great experiment is not working, is it?

1032
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:13,048
如果真的有戰爭 如何阻止那些皈依的印第安人叛變
Yes, he's right.

1033
01:33:13,268 --> 01:33:16,683
趁著我們睡覺的時候
If there's war, what is to stop our praying Indians

1034
01:33:16,937 --> 01:33:18,051
割斷我們的喉嚨
from rising up

1035
01:33:18,313 --> 01:33:20,850
信念，托馬斯，信念
and slitting our throats as we sleep?

1036
01:33:21,065 --> 01:33:22,264
我知道什麼能阻止他們
Faith, Thomas. Faith.

1037
01:33:24,068 --> 01:33:25,859
阿瑟與約翰尼的友誼
I know what will stop them.

1038
01:33:26,111 --> 01:33:28,518
約翰尼絕不會背叛阿瑟
Arthur's friendship with Johnny Sassamon.

1039
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:31,021
他崇拜阿瑟
Johnny would never betray Arthur.

1040
01:33:31,365 --> 01:33:33,072
就像彼特崇拜
He worships him.

1041
01:33:33,324 --> 01:33:34,487
耶穌
As Peter worshipped

1042
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:35,364
先生們，醫生
Jesus.

1043
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:36,856
如果真的有戰爭
Gentlemen. Doctor.

1044
01:33:40,414 --> 01:33:42,240
就請求上帝吧
If there's a true war,

1045
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:43,916
我們和野蠻人都活不了
God help us all.

1046
01:33:44,126 --> 01:33:47,042
我看總督對徵兆的判斷力比不上他
for neither we nor the savaged will survive it.

1047
01:33:51,506 --> 01:33:55,549
他的虔誠的顧問.
I see the governor appreciates the signs less than yee,

1048
01:33:55,759 --> 01:33:57,301
不會事事如意
his Godly advisors.

1049
01:33:58,594 --> 01:34:00,966
很奇怪，弗吉尼亞也是如此
It is not always easy.

1050
01:34:01,513 --> 01:34:04,929
在他們攻擊之前
Strangely, the same thing happened in Virginia.

1051
01:34:05,892 --> 01:34:07,600
根本沒有任何徵兆
Before the attack,

1052
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:10,968
什麼樣的徵兆？
there were signs that went unheeded.

1053
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:13,517
寒冷的冬天，糧食欠收
What manner of signs?

1054
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:16,305
鎮子裏有過多的信徒和外來人
The bad winter. The crop failures.

1055
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:20,523
一些小小的不安分子
Far too many Quakers and foreigners in the town.

1056
01:34:22,529 --> 01:34:23,692
諸如此類
Some minor elements

1057
01:34:23,948 --> 01:34:26,319
說的對，說的對
of witchcraft, etc.

1058
01:34:26,866 --> 01:34:27,862
我們的第一個徵兆是
Exactly!

1059
01:34:28,743 --> 01:34:31,031
海絲特·白蘭因和她的那些聚會
Our first sign was that

1060
01:34:31,244 --> 01:34:33,948
然後又是嚴寒的冬天
of Hester Prynne and her women's meetings.

1061
01:34:34,163 --> 01:34:36,239
糧食欠收
Then the severe winter.

1062
01:34:36,456 --> 01:34:38,081
您看，先生
The failed crops.

1063
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:39,537
我的同事從一開始
You see, sir,

1064
01:34:40,043 --> 01:34:42,166
就擔心白蘭因太太的事
my colleague has feared from the start,

1065
01:34:42,378 --> 01:34:44,834
跟巫術有關係
that in the matter of Mistress Prynne,

1066
01:34:45,173 --> 01:34:47,544
為什麼一直以來你們沒有採取適當的措施
witchcraft was involved.

1067
01:34:47,883 --> 01:34:50,587
清潔殖民地？
Then why in all this time have you not taken measures

1068
01:34:50,844 --> 01:34:53,001
您的意思是？
to cleanse your colony?

1069
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,426
你們查過那些參加聚會的女人嗎？
What measures do you speak of?

1070
01:34:56,681 --> 01:35:00,298
有沒有詢問過接生的人
Did you examine the women present at those meetings?

1071
01:35:00,559 --> 01:35:02,764
或者檢查過那個孩子有沒有女巫的標記
Have you queried the midwife,

1072
01:35:02,977 --> 01:35:06,227
雖然我要穿越死亡陰影之地
or inspected the child for the witch's marks?

1073
01:35:11,904 --> 01:35:14,563
可我不怕邪惡

1074
01:35:15,534 --> 01:35:17,784
因為有您存在，有您權杖的指引，有您給我安慰

1075
01:35:15,904 --> 01:35:17,563
I shall fear no evil.

1076
01:35:17,788 --> 01:35:21,818
您讓我的敵人與我坐在同一張桌前

1077
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:27,325
您為我施塗油之禮

1078
01:35:22,534 --> 01:35:25,784
I prepare us a table in the presence of thine enemy.

1079
01:35:26,788 --> 01:35:27,818
My cup

1080
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:28,738
您無盡的仁慈和憐憫會與我同行

1081
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,325
runneth over.

1082
01:35:28,999 --> 01:35:33,541
而我將永遠做您的僕人

1083
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,738
Surely goodness

1084
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:32,541
and mercy shall follow me.

1085
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:35,704
孩子很乾淨
I will dwell in the house of the Lord.

1086
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:41,542
到目前為止
The babe's clean,

1087
01:35:41,841 --> 01:35:43,085
海絲特太太,
at present.

1088
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:44,084
我們會把孩子暫時留給你
Hester,

1089
01:35:44,385 --> 01:35:46,958
可你要保證她會成為基督信徒
we shall leave your child with you for the present,

1090
01:35:47,179 --> 01:35:49,930
是的，是的
but you must assure us it will be raised a Christian.

1091
01:35:51,766 --> 01:35:53,010
我會的
Yes, yes.

1092
01:35:58,687 --> 01:35:59,766
今天我是你的朋友，孩子
Yes.

1093
01:36:06,444 --> 01:36:08,352
但是不可能天天如此，不
I've been your friend today.

1094
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:11,239
因為我心中的仇恨，與日俱增
But it cannot always be so. No.

1095
01:36:12,114 --> 01:36:16,277
我是那麼地渴望你
For inside me I grow more wretched by the day.

1096
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,708
我怕我會因為你
I yearn so much for thee.

1097
01:36:29,294 --> 01:36:31,204
把整個世界毀掉
I fear I might destroy

1098
01:36:31,421 --> 01:36:34,125
告訴老哈里森 什麼事讓你心煩
her whole world to win her back.

1099
01:36:59,275 --> 01:37:02,809
我真沒有想到
Tell old Harriet what's troubling you.

1100
01:37:03,237 --> 01:37:04,814
他們的懲罰會這樣殘忍和狡詐
I never imagined

1101
01:37:05,196 --> 01:37:08,612
斯頓赫爾和奇夫在大街上為我敲鑼打鼓
how cruel and cunning their punishment could be.

1102
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:15,818
鎮上的人對我指點，漫罵
Stonehall y Cheever stop to preach at me in the street.

1103
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,784
甚至還有孩子
The people pointing and shouting.

1104
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:21,999
那個可惡的小鼓手跟著我到處走
Even the children.

1105
01:37:25,378 --> 01:37:28,665
也許這也是徒勞的
And that horrible drummer boy following me everywhere.

1106
01:37:32,469 --> 01:37:34,259
我作為女人不能過快樂的一生
Perhaps it was all for naught.

1107
01:37:39,974 --> 01:37:43,223
活著還有什麼意思
I wonder if to be a woman is worthwhile at all.

1108
01:37:44,435 --> 01:37:46,559
勇敢點，孩子
Even for the happiest of women.

1109
01:37:47,564 --> 01:37:49,472
至少你知道了什麼是愛
Courage, child.

1110
01:37:49,982 --> 01:37:53,895
難道愛的代價是要讓我毀掉他嗎
Take heart. At least you've known what it is to love.

1111
01:37:54,318 --> 01:37:56,891
難道
But what if I've repaid it by destroying him?

1112
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:59,317
我一直堅信的一切都是虛假的
What if

1113
01:38:00,448 --> 01:38:03,613
愚蠢
everything I believed so strongly was a lie?

1114
01:38:06,995 --> 01:38:08,074
而自私的
Vain and

1115
01:38:09,038 --> 01:38:09,737
白蘭因殘忍的懲罰
selfish.

1116
01:38:27,178 --> 01:38:29,051
還在繼續著
Prynne's cruelpunishments

1117
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:30,549
季節交替
were succeeding.

1118
01:38:31,431 --> 01:38:33,672
而父親與母親之間的距離無法穿越
The seasons ran theircourse.

1119
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:37,047
母親冒著極大的危險給父親寫信
The distance between them was impassable.

1120
01:38:39,853 --> 01:38:43,684
提醒他堅守他們的愛情，堅守沉默
My mother took the terrible risk ofwriting to my father,

1121
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:48,358
而白蘭因若有若無
reminding to keep theirlove and his silence.

1122
01:38:48,694 --> 01:38:51,480
接連不斷地出現
The subtle but constant presence ofPrynne

1123
01:38:51,738 --> 01:38:53,196
折磨著我父親的心靈
was a torment

1124
01:38:53,447 --> 01:38:55,735
至於白蘭因
that threatened my father's very soul.

1125
01:38:59,493 --> 01:39:00,868
他報復的慾望
As forPrynne,

1126
01:39:01,286 --> 01:39:02,828
開始膨脹
his lust forrevenge

1127
01:39:03,121 --> 01:39:04,449
他更加變本加厲地報復
fed on itself

1128
01:39:04,664 --> 01:39:06,703
你好，米杜芭
so that he hungered formore.

1129
01:39:13,462 --> 01:39:15,004
今天真是個出門的好天氣
Good morrow, Mituba.

1130
01:39:18,424 --> 01:39:20,547
可憐的米杜芭
What a pleasant day for a ride.

1131
01:39:24,721 --> 01:39:26,464
你對太太的忠誠是出了名的，現在我知道原因了
Poor Mituba.

1132
01:39:27,599 --> 01:39:31,299
你那乾巴巴的午餐是她情人的信嗎
You're renowned for your loyalty to your Mistress, and I see why.

1133
01:39:33,896 --> 01:39:38,058
你知道，我有能力把你當成通姦者的同謀抓起來
Was your dry lunch a communication from her lover?

1134
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:46,986
把你帶到官員面前問話
I have the power to arrest you as an accomplice t adultery

1135
01:39:47,238 --> 01:39:49,908
不過你是個奴隸
and bring you before the magistrates for questioning.

1136
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,241
他們可能會用鞭子把你打死
And since you are a slave,

1137
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:56,528
打死，打死
they might whip you to death.

1138
01:39:58,956 --> 01:40:00,414
我只想幫助我們都愛的那個人
Easy. Easy.

1139
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,573
從撒旦的魔爪下逃出來
I only want to help the one we both love.

1140
01:40:06,003 --> 01:40:08,292
哦，我的上帝，夠了
To free herself from the grasp of a fiend.

1141
01:40:08,589 --> 01:40:10,497
他是不是當著你的面脫光
Dear Lord, this is it!

1142
01:40:10,757 --> 01:40:14,089
全部脫光
He made you strip naked before him!

1143
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:19,675
當時屋裏有人嗎
Totally naked!

1144
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:23,890
好好想想，想想
Was there a presence in the room?

1145
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,559
也許他是帶著偽裝進來的
Now think! Think!

1146
01:40:26,102 --> 01:40:28,390
他是不是變成了一隻鳥，
He might have come in one of his many disguises.

1147
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:30,354
哦，上帝，我感覺到了
Did he come as a bird?

1148
01:40:37,236 --> 01:40:39,062
魔鬼的存在
Oh, God. I feel

1149
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:41,401
救救你自己吧 不然就太晚了
the presence of Lucifer!

1150
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:44,568
先生們
Save yourself before it's too late!

1151
01:40:44,825 --> 01:40:46,283
夠了，夠了
Gentlemen, please!

1152
01:40:46,534 --> 01:40:47,316
夠了
Enough!

1153
01:40:48,912 --> 01:40:49,943
回去吧，米杜芭 你幫了很大的忙
Enough!

1154
01:40:52,915 --> 01:40:56,330
向你的主人誇誇我們
Go home, Mituba. You've been a wondrous help.

1155
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:59,410
回家吧
Commend us to your Mistress.

1156
01:41:00,795 --> 01:41:01,791
回家吧
Go home.

1157
01:41:02,922 --> 01:41:03,953
這麼說，這兒有個惡魔
Go home.

1158
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:15,682
需要剷除
So there is a malignancy

1159
01:41:15,891 --> 01:41:17,385
但是，一個奴隸上法庭能做什麼證
to be cut our here.

1160
01:41:18,226 --> 01:41:20,717
那隻鳥，顯然是哈里森·希本斯
But what kind of witness will a slave be in court?

1161
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:23,806
怎麼了，珠兒
The bird, obviously. is Harriet Hibbons.

1162
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:34,524
- 原諒我，海絲特. - 哈里森
What is it, Pearl?

1163
01:41:37,783 --> 01:41:39,609
我藏在你這兒應該是最安全的了
- Forgive me, Hester. - Harriet.

1164
01:41:39,826 --> 01:41:42,281
怎麼了
Yours was the first place I thought of to hide.

1165
01:41:42,494 --> 01:41:43,194
他們，他們，
What is it?

1166
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:46,537
闖進了我們屋子 現在應該去樹林裏找我了
They've, they've, they've ah...

1167
01:41:46,747 --> 01:41:49,701
我被說成是個
broken into my house. They're looking for me in the woods.

1168
01:41:57,006 --> 01:41:58,464
女巫
I've been named

1169
01:41:58,673 --> 01:42:00,167
哦，上帝
as a witch!

1170
01:42:02,551 --> 01:42:04,045
停下
In the name of God!

1171
01:42:13,269 --> 01:42:14,265
是，長官
Halt there!

1172
01:42:14,478 --> 01:42:15,593
你們闖進我家幹什麼，少校
Yes, sir!

1173
01:42:21,525 --> 01:42:23,647
讓開，夫人
What's the meaning of this intrusion?

1174
01:42:23,943 --> 01:42:24,974
我們知道那個女巫在這兒
Stand aside, woman!

1175
01:42:25,194 --> 01:42:26,771
這裏沒有外人
We know the witch is in here.

1176
01:42:26,987 --> 01:42:27,852
只有我，我的孩子和米杜芭
There's no one inside

1177
01:42:28,113 --> 01:42:30,865
要是你沒有搜查令，請走吧
but me, my child and Mituba.

1178
01:42:31,283 --> 01:42:33,524
丁梅斯黛爾牧師
So unless you have a warrant, be gone.

1179
01:42:35,577 --> 01:42:37,569
怎麼回事，少校
Reverend Dimmesdale.

1180
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,777
我們圍住了一個女巫
What's happening, major?

1181
01:42:40,414 --> 01:42:43,533
在海絲特·白蘭因的屋子裏
We've cornered ourselves a witch.

1182
01:42:44,876 --> 01:42:47,959
如果這個房子裏真的有女巫的話，少校
Here in Hester Prynne's cottage.

1183
01:42:48,628 --> 01:42:52,080
我會找到的
If there's a witch inside the house, major,

1184
01:42:53,258 --> 01:42:55,166
好吧
I'll find her.

1185
01:42:57,677 --> 01:42:58,673
士兵，守住門口
Right.

1186
01:43:01,472 --> 01:43:02,965
是的
One man at the door.

1187
01:43:03,181 --> 01:43:04,556
珠兒長高了
- Soldier! - Sir?

1188
01:43:32,872 --> 01:43:34,615
她是個淘氣包
Pearl's grown tall.

1189
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:39,042
很任性
She's an elf.

1190
01:43:39,919 --> 01:43:41,199
感謝上帝
Willful.

1191
01:43:42,629 --> 01:43:44,336
這麼久了
Dear God, Hester.

1192
01:43:50,468 --> 01:43:51,962
你瘦了
It's been so long.

1193
01:43:55,973 --> 01:43:57,383
你藏了什麼了嗎，海絲特?
You'r thin.

1194
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:07,513
為什麼
Are you hiding someone, Hester?

1195
01:44:11,902 --> 01:44:13,277
你為什麼要冒這個險
Why do you...?

1196
01:44:14,654 --> 01:44:16,314
去激怒那些人
Why are you risking

1197
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:20,231
因為她不是女巫 除了說實話
further anger from the elders?

1198
01:44:20,450 --> 01:44:24,150
她沒有犯過罪
Because she is no witch! She's committed no crime

1199
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:25,786
如果她是無罪的
beyond speaking her mind!

1200
01:44:26,037 --> 01:44:26,737
我向你保證她不會受到傷害
If she is innocent,

1201
01:44:27,914 --> 01:44:31,661
阿瑟，發生了這麼多事
I assure you no harm will befall her.

1202
01:44:32,084 --> 01:44:35,915
你怎麼還能相信那些殘忍的人
Arthur. After all that has happened,

1203
01:44:36,546 --> 01:44:38,538
難道你沒看見嗎
how can you still trust these iron men?

1204
01:44:40,715 --> 01:44:42,458
上個月他們帶莎麗·肖特去問話
Don't you see what's happening?

1205
01:44:43,426 --> 01:44:45,833
他們關了她兩天 上個星期是瑪麗·盧林斯
Last month they brought Sally Short for questioning.

1206
01:44:46,094 --> 01:44:49,343
海絲特，他們只是詢問她們
They held her for 2 days. Last week it was Mary Rollins.

1207
01:44:49,555 --> 01:44:51,214
這有什麼罪
They just questioned them!

1208
01:44:51,973 --> 01:44:53,219
罪行是她們什麼都沒有做
What's the crime in that?

1209
01:44:53,475 --> 01:44:55,099
你看不出
The crime is they had nothing!

1210
01:44:56,311 --> 01:44:57,010
這是一個惡毒陰謀的一部分嗎
Don't you see

1211
01:44:57,228 --> 01:44:58,805
- 你是怎麼了 - 天啊，夫人
this is some malevolence?

1212
01:44:59,396 --> 01:45:01,887
你還想怎麼樣
- What has become of you? - God, woman!

1213
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:07,607
為了你我放棄所有神聖的東西
What are your demands?

1214
01:45:07,903 --> 01:45:09,776
我進了地獄
I've given up everything I own sacred!

1215
01:45:11,948 --> 01:45:13,407
你的丈夫，日夜周旋在我的身邊
I'm in Hell!

1216
01:45:14,367 --> 01:45:17,403
而鎮上的居民都來找我釋放他們的心靈的負擔
In the eye of your husband, who lurks at my side day and night.

1217
01:45:17,619 --> 01:45:21,367
我是骯髒的
In the eye of all who come to me to unburden their soul!

1218
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:23,205
我是騙子
I'm a pollution!

1219
01:45:23,415 --> 01:45:24,197
不，他們才是骯髒的
I'm a lie!

1220
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:27,867
他們才是騙子
They are the pollution!

1221
01:45:28,085 --> 01:45:29,283
而你在縱容他們毀掉你身上美好的東西
They are the lie!

1222
01:45:29,711 --> 01:45:32,747
我愛的那個人怎麼了
But you allow them to destroy all that is good in you!

1223
01:45:33,673 --> 01:45:36,045
他還活在你的身體裏嗎
What's happened to the man I love?

1224
01:45:36,342 --> 01:45:38,002
我們的愛，夫人，是荒唐的
Does he not still live inside thee?

1225
01:45:38,343 --> 01:45:40,916
我們心聲也是假的
Our love, woman, was a folly.

1226
01:45:41,929 --> 01:45:43,423
而我們因此受到了懲罰
And the voice we heard,

1227
01:45:43,722 --> 01:45:47,173
我變成什麼了
we have been punished for listening to!

1228
01:46:15,122 --> 01:46:16,700
他們出賣了世界上唯一向她表現出好意的人
What have I become?

1229
01:46:58,614 --> 01:47:02,658
還有什麼比這更糟糕的
To betray the onlyperson on earth who had shown herkindness.

1230
01:47:03,618 --> 01:47:05,657
米杜芭？
What could feel worse than that?

1231
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:06,486
可憐的米杜芭
Mituba?

1232
01:47:06,703 --> 01:47:08,530
當白蘭因傳喚她的時候
Poor, mute Mituba.

1233
01:47:09,706 --> 01:47:10,986
她只是想消除可能給女主人帶來的傷害
When Prynne summoned her,

1234
01:47:11,207 --> 01:47:14,907
大家肅靜
she wanted only to undo the harm sh'd caused her Mistress.

1235
01:47:18,046 --> 01:47:19,954
肅靜，我說肅靜
Peace in this House!

1236
01:47:20,422 --> 01:47:22,249
你覺得這些程序很好笑嗎，太太
Peace, I say. Peace!

1237
01:47:23,133 --> 01:47:27,592
你指望我把它們當回事嗎
You find these proceedings humorous, Mistress?

1238
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:32,636
看著一群成年人揭開我的隱私
Do you expect me to take them seriously?

1239
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:35,350
尋找女巫的標記不好笑嗎
You're a bunch of grown men

1240
01:47:35,559 --> 01:47:39,057
那個奴隸，米杜芭
poking around my private parts looking for witch's marks!

1241
01:47:42,564 --> 01:47:44,141
肅靜，肅靜
The slave, Mituba...

1242
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:46,064
恐怕我們的證人，那個奴隸，米杜芭 已經死了
Peace, I say. Peace!

1243
01:47:46,567 --> 01:47:51,311
我說過她是個女巫
The witness, the slave Mituba, has been found dead.

1244
01:47:56,493 --> 01:47:58,401
- 希本斯太太是個女巫 - 她是個女巫
I told you she was a witch!

1245
01:47:58,702 --> 01:48:01,240
女巫
- Mistress Hibbons is a witch! - She's a witch!

1246
01:48:02,914 --> 01:48:03,613
你們都失去理智了嗎
Witch!

1247
01:48:09,168 --> 01:48:10,543
這裏沒有什麼女巫
Have you lost all reason?

1248
01:48:11,545 --> 01:48:13,584
這是謀殺
There's no witchcraft here!

1249
01:48:14,213 --> 01:48:15,376
警衛
This is murder!

1250
01:48:15,841 --> 01:48:16,871
制止這個女人
Guards,

1251
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:18,005
撒旦從來不附著在女人的身上
restrain this woman!

1252
01:48:21,428 --> 01:48:24,000
如果他在這兒，也許就附著在你們男人的身上
Satan is not at work here among the women!

1253
01:48:24,263 --> 01:48:28,176
是撒旦在講話
But if he's here, perhaps is at work among you men!

1254
01:48:28,433 --> 01:48:29,891
總督
Here Satan speaks!

1255
01:48:31,852 --> 01:48:33,050
我有證據呈遞
Governor?

1256
01:48:33,853 --> 01:48:35,644
你們都知道
I have evidence to render.

1257
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:38,516
希本斯夫人曾經替白蘭因太太接生
As you know,

1258
01:48:38,774 --> 01:48:42,024
那個珠兒
Mistress Hibbons midwifed Mistress Prynne's

1259
01:48:42,277 --> 01:48:43,901
可愛的珠兒
baby Pearl.

1260
01:48:50,033 --> 01:48:50,982
雜種
Sweet Pearl.

1261
01:48:51,368 --> 01:48:52,565
不
Bastard!

1262
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:58,905
珠兒，珠兒，可愛的珠兒
No!

1263
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:01,699
多希望你是我的女兒
Pearl.

1264
01:49:03,752 --> 01:49:05,460
可憐的沒父親的孩子
I wish you were my girl.

1265
01:49:11,258 --> 01:49:13,380
你想玩個遊戲嗎
Poor fatherless child.

1266
01:49:13,759 --> 01:49:16,131
好的，照我這樣做
Would you like to learn a game?

1267
01:49:22,183 --> 01:49:24,969
如果我捏我的鼻子
Yes. Now do what I do.

1268
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:27,643
該你了 很好，很好
If I pinch my nose.

1269
01:49:28,271 --> 01:49:30,843
現在
You too. Very good, very good.

1270
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:31,894
我掀開我的衣服露出我的肚子
Now,

1271
01:49:34,692 --> 01:49:37,728
現在讓我看看你的肚子
pull up my shirt and show my tummy tum-tum.

1272
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:41,485
掀開你的衣服
Now show me your tummy tum-tum.

1273
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:43,442
這就是女巫的標誌
Pull up your shirt.

1274
01:49:54,249 --> 01:49:57,784
這就是惡魔的孩子
Behold the witch's mark!

1275
01:50:02,548 --> 01:50:06,247
這就是惡魔的孩子 這個孩子應該被絞死
Behold the devil's own child!

1276
01:50:18,518 --> 01:50:22,729
不
The devil's own child! The devil's own child!

1277
01:50:29,214 --> 01:50:30,147
把孩子給我

1278
01:50:30,329 --> 01:50:31,045
希本斯是無辜的，不能絞死她

1279
01:50:43,955 --> 01:50:45,781
無辜？從你第一次為那個女人求情
This woman is innocent!

1280
01:50:45,998 --> 01:50:48,702
我們以主的名義夢想和奮鬥的一切就受到了威脅
Innocent? Since you first spoke of this woman,

1281
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:52,415
我已經聽夠了
all we've dreames and toiled for in God's name has been threatened!

1282
01:50:53,003 --> 01:50:54,117
你聽見了嗎？
I've heard enough!

1283
01:50:54,671 --> 01:50:55,951
爭論！辯解！分歧！
Have you listened?

1284
01:50:56,339 --> 01:50:59,044
這都是撒旦在做祟
Factions! Arguments! Dissent!

1285
01:50:59,259 --> 01:51:01,001
現在鎮子亂成一團
That is the work of Satan!

1286
01:51:04,596 --> 01:51:06,552
我父親冒險最後一次去見我母親
The town was in an uproar.

1287
01:51:07,639 --> 01:51:10,889
告訴她如果他們要絞死哈里森
My fatherrisked one last meeting with my mother,

1288
01:51:11,517 --> 01:51:13,343
那過不了多久
convinced that ifthey were to hang

1289
01:51:13,602 --> 01:51:16,057
母親和我也會被抓起來 然後被絞死
Harriet, it would not be long

1290
01:51:16,312 --> 01:51:20,226
我要大聲喊叫
before my motherand I would be seized... and hung.

1291
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,984
我無法控制自己
I had to speak out.

1292
01:51:26,195 --> 01:51:27,772
詛咒你的丈夫吧，海絲特
I couldn't stop myself.

1293
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:30,733
你和珠兒必須躲起來 今晚
Damn your husband!

1294
01:51:37,286 --> 01:51:40,406
我不能
You and Pearl must go in hiding. Tonight.

1295
01:51:40,624 --> 01:51:41,738
我不能走
I cannot.

1296
01:51:42,667 --> 01:51:43,947
你在說什麼
I cannot run.

1297
01:51:44,835 --> 01:51:45,831
請原諒我
What are you saying?

1298
01:51:53,508 --> 01:51:54,670
無論發生什麼
Forgive me.

1299
01:51:57,094 --> 01:51:58,588
向我保證你會永遠照顧珠兒
Whatever happens,

1300
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:00,720
上帝，這種痛苦你還要承受多久
promise me you'll look after Pearl. I.

1301
01:52:02,057 --> 01:52:05,756
只要有勇氣我就會去接受
God, woman, how much further must you take this?

1302
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,967
如果哈里森被絞死 我會陪她一起死
As far as my strength will take me.

1303
01:52:11,897 --> 01:52:14,352
我會讓其他女人和我們同一陣線
If Harriet is to hang, I must hang with her.

1304
01:52:18,568 --> 01:52:21,273
他們不能把我們都絞死
I'll ask the other women to stand with us.

1305
01:52:22,489 --> 01:52:23,983
海絲特，我們永遠不能在一起了嗎
They can't hang us all.

1306
01:52:28,076 --> 01:52:31,444
我愛你
Hester, are we ever to know a life together?

1307
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:36,701
哦上帝啊，我愛你，永遠都愛你
I love thee.

1308
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,130
我也會永遠愛你
I love thee and always will.

1309
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:44,546
上帝啊 我們曾毫無保留地站在你面前
I will always love thee.

1310
01:52:55,389 --> 01:52:58,887
現在作為一家人
Lord God, we stood before thee naked once,

1311
01:52:59,768 --> 01:53:01,725
我們再次毫無保留地站在你面前
and now we stand before thee

1312
01:53:01,936 --> 01:53:04,178
上帝，既然你把這個禮物送給了我
naked again, as a family.

1313
01:53:05,356 --> 01:53:09,482
我就絕不，絕不放棄它
God! Thou has given me this as a gift,

1314
01:53:10,401 --> 01:53:14,148
只要我還有勇氣
and I will not give it up!

1315
01:53:16,363 --> 01:53:18,023
阿瑟?
Not while I have the strength.

1316
01:53:52,809 --> 01:53:53,888
阿瑟?
Arthur?

1317
01:54:13,324 --> 01:54:14,273
阿瑟?
Arthur?

1318
01:54:38,844 --> 01:54:39,875
晚上好，白蘭因太太. 在等什麼人嗎？
Arthur?

1319
01:55:05,365 --> 01:55:09,990
哦，不
Evening Mistress Prynne. Expecting someone else?

1320
01:55:10,202 --> 01:55:11,482
你剛才不是在叫阿瑟嗎
Ah, no.

1321
01:55:11,828 --> 01:55:13,535
據我所知，只有一個阿瑟 那就是丁梅斯黛爾
Didn't you call out for Arthur?

1322
01:55:14,246 --> 01:55:16,653
你誤解我了 我沒有…
The only Arthur I know is... Dimmesdale.

1323
01:55:16,873 --> 01:55:19,992
我早就該猜到
You misunderstood me, I didn't say...

1324
01:55:20,667 --> 01:55:23,621
你這個淘氣的姑娘
I should have guessed long ago.

1325
01:55:24,254 --> 01:55:26,626
你勾引了我們的牧師
You naughty girl.

1326
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:29,547
上帝啊我的聖父，我該如何品味這無價的佳餚呢
So you fucked our minister.

1327
01:55:32,261 --> 01:55:36,257
沒想到，他對你做了什麼
God, I'm about to savour a priceless morsel!

1328
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:38,389
他親吻你的胸部？
Up we go!

1329
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,309
他舔舐你了嗎？
Did he suck your breasts?

1330
01:55:44,562 --> 01:55:45,890
他舔舐你什麼地方
Did he lick you?

1331
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:49,481
讓我看看
Where did he lick you?

1332
01:55:49,941 --> 01:55:50,854
上帝啊，我多希望進入你的身體
Show me!

1333
01:55:52,776 --> 01:55:54,899
這就是你讓我對你產生幻想的代價
How I wanted to put it in you!

1334
01:56:02,618 --> 01:56:05,190
你迷惑我
This is to make you pay for my fantasies.

1335
01:56:06,579 --> 01:56:08,736
可你卻把身體給了另一個人
While you were torturing me,

1336
01:56:08,955 --> 01:56:10,782
該死的女巫！
you were giving it to another.

1337
01:56:26,136 --> 01:56:27,844
滾出去！
Damned witch!

1338
01:56:28,054 --> 01:56:29,050
穿上你的褲子滾出去！
Get out!

1339
01:56:31,432 --> 01:56:33,554
你這雜種！滾出去！
Do up your britches and get out!

1340
01:56:42,356 --> 01:56:45,143
我會很高興看到你和你的牧師被絞死
Bastard! Get out of here!

1341
01:56:45,401 --> 01:56:49,065
開門，醫生
How I will enjoy watching you and the pastor hang!

1342
01:57:02,913 --> 01:57:04,491
你和我之間的問題必須馬上解決
Open up, doctor!

1343
01:57:05,624 --> 01:57:09,206
好吧，阿瑟·丁梅斯黛爾
There are matters between us we must discus immediately.

1344
01:57:37,024 --> 01:57:39,728
這是天意
So, Arthur Dimmesdale.

1345
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:45,443
他被謀殺了！
At last justice is done!

1346
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:24,809
快去找民兵 快去找警衛
？a sido asesinado!

1347
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,235
這是神跡 上帝給了我們神跡
Call out the militia! Call out the guards!

1348
01:59:29,528 --> 01:59:33,022
肯定是印第安人幹的,把他們關起來

1349
01:59:29,528 --> 01:59:34,022
It's a sign! The Lord has sent us a sign!

1350
01:59:33,462 --> 01:59:34,049
我們偏離了上帝

1351
01:59:35,699 --> 01:59:37,442
看他怎麼懲罰我們吧
We have strayed!

1352
01:59:39,243 --> 01:59:41,815
是布魯斯特，那些野蠻人
See how he punishes us!

1353
01:59:42,787 --> 01:59:45,277
把他給殺了
It's Brewster. Those savages

1354
01:59:45,497 --> 01:59:46,363
我的兒子！我的兒子！
have killed him!

1355
01:59:46,707 --> 01:59:48,249
該死的異教徒！
My son! My son!

1356
01:59:49,293 --> 01:59:51,668
在他們把我們謀殺在床上之前

1357
01:59:50,293 --> 01:59:51,668
Damned heathens!

1358
01:59:52,336 --> 01:59:54,293
把那些印第安人關起來
Lock up the praying Indians,

1359
01:59:54,505 --> 01:59:57,421
把他們關起來
before they murder us in our beds!

1360
01:59:57,632 --> 01:59:59,624
把印第安人關進籬笆院子裏
Get the praying Indians!

1361
02:00:00,842 --> 02:00:03,092
快點

1362
02:00:00,842 --> 02:00:04,092
Praying Indians into the compound!

1363
02:00:03,624 --> 02:00:04,085
我們忠誠於你們

1364
02:00:05,095 --> 02:00:06,471
We are loyal to you!

1365
02:00:08,307 --> 02:00:10,014
白蘭因太太 受馬賽諸賽海岸殖民地總督之命
We are loyal to you!

1366
02:00:20,108 --> 02:00:24,733
因為你的種種異端行為 你被逮捕了
By order of the Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony,

1367
02:00:25,153 --> 02:00:29,198
住手！是我們的人殺了布魯斯特！
you are under arrest for the crime of heresy.

1368
02:00:33,076 --> 02:00:35,993
是我們的人，我有證據
Stop this. It was one of us who killed Brewster.

1369
02:00:38,997 --> 02:00:40,870
雜種！
I have proof.

1370
02:00:44,835 --> 02:00:45,997
約翰尼，麥特坎姆在河邊，我看見他了
Bastard!

1371
02:00:46,503 --> 02:00:49,587
告訴他快來拯救他的人，快去
Johnny, run to Metacomet's place by the river.

1372
02:00:51,299 --> 02:00:55,247
女巫們來了
Tell him to come and save his people. Run, man!

1373
02:00:58,971 --> 02:01:00,299
打開囚籠
Here come the witches!

1374
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:05,556
- 別管孩子 - 珠兒!
Open the cell.

1375
02:01:17,111 --> 02:01:19,482
- 進去，進去你這個女人 - 珠兒?
- Never mind the child. - Pearl!

1376
02:01:19,946 --> 02:01:21,404
別擔心，白蘭因太太
- Get in, woman! - Pearl?

1377
02:01:22,072 --> 02:01:23,863
- 我會把她養大，讓她敬畏上帝 - 珠兒
Worry not, Mistress.

1378
02:01:24,074 --> 02:01:26,362
如果這是為了最高利益
I'll see she's raised up to fear the Lord.

1379
02:01:35,625 --> 02:01:37,713
我們將服從您的旨意

1380
02:01:38,926 --> 02:01:41,343
開門，殺人犯

1381
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:47,547
他們說的是真的
Open up, murderer!

1382
02:02:04,397 --> 02:02:06,626
大家別那樣做

1383
02:02:14,264 --> 02:02:15,359
這裏根本沒有什麼女巫

1384
02:02:17,532 --> 02:02:20,069
絞死她
There is no witchcraft here!

1385
02:02:20,596 --> 02:02:21,687
如果我們絞死這些女人

1386
02:02:22,411 --> 02:02:24,652
那我們變成了什麼
If we hang these women,

1387
02:02:25,246 --> 02:02:27,368
我們是誰
then what have we become?

1388
02:02:28,374 --> 02:02:29,536
又怎麼能代表上帝
Who are we

1389
02:02:29,875 --> 02:02:31,037
來執法
to condemn

1390
02:02:31,335 --> 02:02:33,291
我深愛這個女人
on God's behalf?

1391
02:02:42,092 --> 02:02:44,878
我就是
I love this woman.

1392
02:02:48,221 --> 02:02:48,756
她孩子的父親
I am

1393
02:02:50,474 --> 02:02:52,799
在上帝的眼裏
the father of her child.

1394
02:02:53,434 --> 02:02:54,762
我就是她的丈夫
And in God's eyes,

1395
02:02:55,895 --> 02:02:57,602
- 絞死她 - 絞死她
I am her husband.

1396
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:04,963
現在如果你們一定要絞死一個人

1397
02:03:06,069 --> 02:03:09,521
才能消除
If you must hang someone,

1398
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:12,115
你們的憤怒和恐懼
to appease

1399
02:03:12,783 --> 02:03:15,949
那就絞死我吧
your anger and fear,

1400
02:03:18,579 --> 02:03:19,954
絞死他！
then hang me.

1401
02:04:01,779 --> 02:04:02,693
絞死他！絞死他！
Hang him!

1402
02:04:04,073 --> 02:04:06,065
絞死他！
Hang him! Hang him!

1403
02:04:06,449 --> 02:04:07,279
絞死他！
Hang him!

1404
02:04:07,854 --> 02:04:08,971
絞死他！

1405
02:04:08,634 --> 02:04:51,053
雜種！

1406
02:05:06,871 --> 02:05:08,448
- 珠兒在哪 - 她在兵工廠
Bastards!

1407
02:05:14,787 --> 02:05:16,134
快走

1408
02:05:16,264 --> 02:05:16,927
海絲特

1409
02:05:49,987 --> 02:05:51,149
Hester!

1410
02:05:50,014 --> 02:05:50,684
我的女兒在哪？

1411
02:05:56,827 --> 02:05:58,107
她在會議室裏
Where's my daughter, Pearl?

1412
02:05:58,411 --> 02:05:59,822
你們自由了，我的朋友 回麥特坎姆那兒去吧
She's in the meeting house!

1413
02:06:30,935 --> 02:06:34,553
回森林裏去
You are free, my people. Go back to Metacomet!

1414
02:06:35,189 --> 02:06:36,564
我們走，帶上我們的人民
Go back to the forest!

1415
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:24,910
貝靈漢總督會想方設法 向英國政府隱瞞這件事

1416
02:07:51,790 --> 02:07:55,918
他向我保證會為你摘下紅字
Bellingham will do anything to conceal this madness from England.

1417
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:00,421
並且公開向你道歉
He has sworn to me that he will remove the letter.

1418
02:08:01,673 --> 02:08:03,961
愛和恨的距離有多遠
And make thee a public apology.

1419
02:08:07,719 --> 02:08:09,841
以後我們再也不受對方的束縛了
How close they are, love and hate.

1420
02:08:11,138 --> 02:08:13,843
安息吧，羅傑·白蘭因
We're no less bound by one than the other.

1421
02:08:18,561 --> 02:08:20,683
這紅字達到了一個目的
Rest in peace, Roger Prynne.

1422
02:08:30,736 --> 02:08:33,108
雖然並不是
This letter has served a purpose.

1423
02:08:33,989 --> 02:08:34,855
他們的初衷
Though not the one

1424
02:08:35,115 --> 02:08:36,443
我為什麼還要留在這兒
they had intended.

1425
02:08:37,951 --> 02:08:39,990
讓他們接受我？被他們馴服我？
So why would I stay here?

1426
02:08:40,327 --> 02:08:44,277
- 沒有完美的世界，海絲特 - 對，沒有完美
To be accepted by them? To be tamed by them?

1427
02:08:51,795 --> 02:08:55,080
所以我們要建立一個親世界
- There is no perfect world. - No, not perfect.

1428
02:08:57,216 --> 02:08:59,422
而且為了珠兒
But we came here to make a new one.

1429
02:09:02,762 --> 02:09:04,303
我必須離開這兒
And for Pearl's sake,

1430
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,598
海絲特
I must do just that.

1431
02:09:13,144 --> 02:09:14,093
海絲特
Hester.

1432
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,436
看著我
Hester!

1433
02:09:21,609 --> 02:09:22,807
如果看著你，我就無法離開
Look at me.

1434
02:09:25,529 --> 02:09:27,402
那就走吧
If I look at you, I won't be able to leave

1435
02:09:27,655 --> 02:09:28,818
勇敢地面對外界
Then leave.

1436
02:09:30,282 --> 02:09:31,740
不過海絲特
Brave the wilds!

1437
02:09:38,998 --> 02:09:40,278
我不會讓你丟下我一個人走
But Hester,

1438
02:09:41,459 --> 02:09:44,992
他們在看我們
I'm not letting you go without me.

1439
02:09:57,554 --> 02:09:58,882
在遙遠的卡羅萊納
They're watching us.

1440
02:10:23,574 --> 02:10:25,945
我的父母終於找到了
In the faraway Carolinas,

1441
02:10:26,576 --> 02:10:29,446
他們久違了的幸福
they were at last to find a measure ofthe happiness

1442
02:10:29,703 --> 02:10:32,454
在我不到十歲的時候父親去世了
that hade been denied them forso long.

1443
02:10:33,539 --> 02:10:36,410
有人說，那裏對他的懲罰
My fatherdied before I reached my teens.

1444
02:10:37,168 --> 02:10:39,326
我的母親沒有再愛上其他人
Some say that was a punishment.

1445
02:10:40,838 --> 02:10:44,171
有人說，那也是對她的一種懲罰
My motherneverremarried norloved another.

1446
02:10:44,966 --> 02:10:47,124
可是我認為
Some say that was a punishment.

1447
02:10:48,302 --> 02:10:49,416
這不是懲罰
As forme,

1448
02:10:50,803 --> 02:10:52,677
我的父母分享了他人所沒有的愛
I do not see it that way.

1449
02:10:53,514 --> 02:10:55,839
我知道那愛的精神就存在於我的心裏
Myparents shared a love like no other.

1450
02:10:56,892 --> 02:11:00,058
並且永遠存在於我的孩子們心裏
I know the spirit ofthat love lives within me.

1451
02:11:00,603 --> 02:11:02,974
誰能說清，在上帝的眼中，什麼是罪惡呢
And will live within my children forever.

1452
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:10,316
誰能說清，在上帝的眼中，什麼是罪惡呢
Who is to say what is a sin in God's eyes?
