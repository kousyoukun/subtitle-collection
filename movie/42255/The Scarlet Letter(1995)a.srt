1
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,718
Chief Metacomet.

2
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,830
Without

3
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,951
your father's friendship,
none of us could have survived.

4
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,032
My father should have let you

5
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:58,753
die!

6
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,202
You are

7
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,085
the only one

8
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,361
who comes to us

9
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:15,566
with an open heart.

10
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,157
But your people have murdered

11
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,964
my father

12
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:24,165
with their lies!

13
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,739
My name is Pearl.

14
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:06,300
This is the story of
my mother, Hester Prynne.

15
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:10,094
It was the year of our Lord 1666,

16
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:13,536
when she arrived in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony

17
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:17,374
filled with the hope that at last,
in this new world

18
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:21,585
would come the freedom to worship
without fear of persecution.

19
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:34,063
My esteemed colleague!

20
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:37,223
Thy years of toil become thee!

21
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,507
Thy fame preceeds thee, sir.

22
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:41,622
Governor Bellingham,

23
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,628
may I present

24
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:46,064
the Reverend Thomas Cheever.

25
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,789
Welcome, sir.
It's a long voyage.

26
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,985
3 months at sea,

27
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:53,471
will either take away your faith,
or harden it to iron.

28
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:58,511
Allow me to introduce a woman
who's been travelling with us,

29
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:00,748
- Mistress...
- Hester Prynne.

30
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:02,993
I apologize for the coarseness

31
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,518
of my hands, Mistress.

32
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,951
But here in the colonies,
everyone must work.

33
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:09,192
I look forward to the hard work.

34
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:13,030
It says id Psalm 92: "I will
triumph in the work of thy hands".

35
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,796
Thou canst quote the Scriptures.

36
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,880
Aye, Reverendo, both Testaments.
My husband taught me.

37
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,113
You must rest.

38
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:23,475
Then I'll show you
what's been accomplished.

39
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:24,515
I thank thee.

40
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:26,443
- Then it's Goodwife Prynne.
- Yes, yes.

41
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,323
But I prefer to be called Hester.

42
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:31,556
Welcome, Hester.

43
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:33,723
I wish I could've seen it before,

44
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:35,726
when it was wild and untouched.

45
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:46,762
Madam,

46
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:51,007
you should use less lace
in your dressmaking.

47
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:55,773
Indeed, Reverend.

48
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:07,289
Master of us all,

49
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,813
we give thanks for
another bountiful meal,

50
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,293
and for newly arrived disciples,

51
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,051
that share it with us this night.

52
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,978
- Amen.
- Amen.

53
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,293
So, Governor.

54
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:27,894
I am impatient to know
how you fared with Metacomet.

55
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,537
Well, Metacomet
isn't Massassoit, Major Dunsmuir.

56
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:36,182
But if we respect the agreements
we made with his father,

57
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:37,495
we've nothing to fear.

58
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,656
So we don't
grow complacent,

59
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,142
our wise God sends us a sign.

60
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:45,018
When we sailed,

61
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,982
your letters said we were
at peace with the savage.

62
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:50,260
Well,

63
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,783
I fear the days of "peace"
with the Wampanoag is at an end.

64
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:55,188
Major,

65
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:58,701
we are frightening
our new arrival.

66
00:07:02,914 --> 00:07:04,904
We hear much

67
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:07,390
of your success
with the praying Indians.

68
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:10,395
I'm very eager to meet
Reverend Dimmesdale

69
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,871
and his converts.

70
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:13,911
The runts of the litter.

71
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:16,395
Dimmesdale's little treasures!

72
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,350
Some of us
have other opinions.

73
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,509
Mistress Prynne,

74
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,149
I hope you'll stay with us

75
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,998
until your husband's arrival.

76
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,915
You're most kind,
but I intend to find

77
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,795
a house of my own
as soon as possible.

78
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:41,353
On thine own?

79
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:42,721
Why, yes.

80
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:46,284
It's not considered fitting
for a young woman to live alone.

81
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:50,323
I've come first to prepare
a place for his arrival,

82
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,164
so that is what I intend to do.

83
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:53,523
Mistress Prynne.

84
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,964
The rules we live by may seem
arbitrary to a newcomer,

85
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,603
but we have learnt
the hard way

86
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,243
that without absolute order,

87
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,804
we cannot hope to survive here.

88
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,730
Rules, Mistress Prynne.

89
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:08,123
Order.

90
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,208
Survival.

91
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:12,526
Would you have me
disobey my husband?

92
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:17,091
- I...
- Reverend, you might enjoy

93
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,015
the company of my son, Brewster.

94
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:22,049
He studied Divinity.

95
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:24,135
Harvard wasn't good enough
for him,

96
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,533
so he came home to
make his fortune as a...

97
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,617
Minister's sons all moaning
the Lord's Prayer

98
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,133
in their sleep.

99
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,737
Everyone must find his place.

100
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:39,573
- Morning, Mistress Prynne.
- Good morrow.

101
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:53,262
So you intend on scandalising
the town!

102
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,296
Get up!

103
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:56,462
Good!

104
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,736
I confess,

105
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,906
I feel alone in a
sea of conformists.

106
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,388
Where should we begin our search?

107
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,508
On the cliffs by the sea.

108
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,429
No, it's out of the question.

109
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:12,148
Why?

110
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:14,743
No one's lived
by the sea

111
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:17,621
since the Indians
wiped out Ballinger's Point.

112
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:19,665
I say we start there.

113
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,388
Well, if you've decided.

114
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:45,878
Is that it, Brewster?

115
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:50,356
It's beautiful.

116
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:19,006
I tried to imagine
what her life was like

117
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,043
before she came
to the new world.

118
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,569
Why did her husband
send her on ahead,

119
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,163
alone?

120
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:27,968
Was it a test of her loyalty,

121
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,407
or her spirit?

122
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:33,373
Or was it in his nature
to set traps

123
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:36,250
for people in the hope
they would fall into them?

124
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,768
It's perfect!

125
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:48,528
With a cart and a musket,
I could have a home here!

126
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,137
A cart, a horse,

127
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:53,013
a pitchfork, a plow.

128
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:55,370
I can think of better things

129
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:57,460
to do with these pretty hands
than grow calluses on them.

130
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,692
I'll need indentured labor,
at least two men.

131
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:04,140
- The land needs draining.
- You are headstrong.

132
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,217
Perhaps it runs in the blood.

133
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:09,975
I'm told your father was too.

134
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:11,901
Is it true

135
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:16,216
he was in debt to your husband
and you were the payment?

136
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,861
I've said something
to disturb you.

137
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:22,260
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,310
I'm truly sorry.

139
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,380
God, thou art wondrous fair!

140
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:35,944
That hurt!

141
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,663
Good. It'll remind you
not to do it again.

142
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:42,467
Faith?
Prudence?

143
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,632
Did you hear Mistress Prynne
has a bathing tub?

144
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:02,035
What is she, French?

145
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,520
2 Shillings.
Will you bid 2 shillings?

146
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:21,397
2 and a half?

147
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,406
Come on, gentlemen,
do I have a bid for 3 shillings?

148
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,120
3 shillings?

149
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,081
3 shillings?

150
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,121
Anyone else?
Anyone else?

151
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,208
Going for 3 shillings.
Any other bids?

152
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:36,483
Sold to the gentleman
for 3 shillings.

153
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:38,681
- Next we have this other one,
- Those two.

154
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:40,809
How much time left
on their indenture?

155
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:42,412
About 3 years, but,

156
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:46,646
shouldn't your husband or father
be doing business with me?

157
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,885
Is my money
no good to you, sir?

158
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:53,005
Your money's as fine as wine
in the sunshine, Mistress.

159
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:57,094
If you buy them at a just price,
I'll throw in the girl in red.

160
00:12:58,499 --> 00:12:59,408
She's a slave!

161
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:02,769
But she don't speak, if that
be a problem. Born that way.

162
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,088
Name your just price.

163
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:45,628
We'd best accompany you
if your going to the forest.

164
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,586
Don't worry Mr Bobbin.
I shan't go far.

165
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,576
Mistress Prynne?
Mistress Prynne?

166
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:49,821
Mistress Prynne?

167
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,221
Where are you?

168
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,463
Mistress Prynne, where are you?

169
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,982
I found her.

170
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,306
- You did not.
- I did to.

171
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:01,229
- You did not.
- I did to.

172
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:02,986
Mistress Prynne,

173
00:16:03,872 --> 00:16:06,705
Have you forgotten
it is the Sabbath?

174
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,825
Of course not.
Forgive me.

175
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,907
We've come by especially
to bring you to church.

176
00:16:15,635 --> 00:16:17,272
Thank you, so much.

177
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:19,594
Please, go on without me.

178
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:21,628
I will follow at once.

179
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:22,911
Make haste.

180
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:24,193
Yes, sir.

181
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:48,593
All right, girl,

182
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,275
Come on.

183
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:03,848
Oh goodnes!

184
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:07,322
Back up. Back up.

185
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:09,443
Come on now, back up.

186
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:17,446
Come on. Come on. Back up.

187
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:19,124
Good morrow.

188
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,453
May I be of assistance?

189
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:30,530
Not from up there.

190
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:32,773
Come on.

191
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,690
Come on.
Steady. Steady.

192
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,458
I can't make this horse
understand me.

193
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:53,175
Let me try.

194
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:57,416
Come on, girl.

195
00:17:57,825 --> 00:17:59,143
Come on, back up!

196
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:01,664
Come on, girl.

197
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,183
Come on. Come on.

198
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,539
I'm afraid you're in too deep.

199
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,468
She'll not make it.
Let me try this.

200
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,579
I do hope you can get it free.

201
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,429
I'm already late for the service,
and everyone's talking about me.

202
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:26,469
I've been away and I'm quite
behind on local gossip.

203
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:29,182
I bought the old Newbury place
out on Ballinger's Point.

204
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:30,788
Then,

205
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,311
I owe you an apology.

206
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,393
I've been trespassing.

207
00:18:36,597 --> 00:18:39,111
There's a place at the point
where I like to bath.

208
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:41,996
Really? Well, I shan't charge
too steep a tariff.

209
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,113
Come on, girl, back up!

210
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,751
- Back up.
- One,

211
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,315
Two,

212
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,836
Two. Three.

213
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,482
I'm afraid this cart will be
stuck here until Sabbath next

214
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,118
unless I gather hands to help.

215
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:07,996
Would you care to ride with me?

216
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:10,718
On your horse, with you?

217
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,921
Aye, unless you can ride.

218
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:15,396
I can ride.

219
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:19,046
You take my horse
and I'll take yours.

220
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:22,758
There's a shortcut
to the meeting house,

221
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,369
but it's a difficult road.

222
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,802
I shall manage, sir.

223
00:19:31,852 --> 00:19:35,128
- Are you certain?
- Just you lead the way.

224
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,765
Come on! Come on!

225
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,855
Come on! Come on!

226
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,302
May God be with you.

227
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:20,583
I'm sure he already is.

228
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,138
But aren't you coming to...

229
00:20:45,032 --> 00:20:46,909
Good Sabbath to ye all.

230
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,228
Friends,

231
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:57,992
and fellow voyagers,

232
00:20:58,198 --> 00:21:00,586
in the greatest of all dreams.

233
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:04,588
We've been singled out,
like Israel of old,

234
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,555
to serve as a model.

235
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,794
But if we are to succeed

236
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:12,873
in building our new Jerusalem,

237
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,837
our "City on a Hill",

238
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:19,233
then the power of love,

239
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:22,476
yea, His Divine Love,

240
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:25,244
we must bind our hearts as one!

241
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:28,440
English and Indian,

242
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:31,680
gentry and indentured,
free man and slaves,

243
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:33,838
and make of us

244
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:36,084
an example for all the world,

245
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,405
to marvel at and proclaim:

246
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:39,883
"Here...

247
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,688
is the measure of perfection!

248
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:45,604
Here,

249
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:48,042
lives God's own!"

250
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:51,046
But we are not succeeding
in that test.

251
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:53,806
We are failing!
And why?

252
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,608
Because we covet,
nay,

253
00:21:57,415 --> 00:22:00,646
we lust after
what is not ours.

254
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,771
Be it for the rich land
of our Indian brothers,

255
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:06,251
be it for glory,

256
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:09,250
for profits or for revenge.

257
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,692
Need I read the secret

258
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:14,129
of every heart?

259
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,171
I will if you want.

260
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:18,895
Yea, I will if you want.

261
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:21,297
I will lay open the secrets

262
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:24,096
before the eyes of God!

263
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:27,459
What thou lusteth after is my enemy,
sayeth the Lord God.

264
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:29,652
For only I shall consume thee,

265
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,376
only I shall fill thee up.

266
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:37,336
If thou failest to heed
my commandments,

267
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:39,423
then my fist

268
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:42,504
shall descend on thee
like a stone!

269
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:46,106
And thy sword shall cut thee
into bloody parts,

270
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,340
and even thy memories
shall be sacrificed

271
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,824
to the winds
for all time!

272
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:53,543
May God bless you,

273
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:57,587
each and every one of you.

274
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:00,226
Amén.

275
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:01,702
Amén.

276
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,951
Allow me to present a newcomer
to our congregation,

277
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:07,381
Mistress Roger Prynne.

278
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:08,904
Mistress Roger?

279
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:12,107
Aye, her husband, a renowned
physician will join her before...

280
00:23:12,317 --> 00:23:14,353
Reverednd Dimmesdale and I
have already...

281
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:17,550
I helped when her cart
got stuck in the woods.

282
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,113
I greatly enjoyed your sermon.

283
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:26,388
It's rare for a man so young
to speak with such passion.

284
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:29,750
For some reason,

285
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,037
I felt most inspired today.

286
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:35,840
We welcome you and your husband
to our congregation.

287
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,236
Mother! Mother!

288
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:52,847
There you are, Hester.

289
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:55,244
Meet my friend, Running Moose.
He's our schoolmaster.

290
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,645
And I'm sure you'd like
some refreshment.

291
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,408
Do you teach the English children
as well Mr Running Moose?

292
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,844
They call me John or Johnny here.

293
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,008
We try our best, but the English
are a bit slow-witted.

294
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:07,604
Slow-witted?

295
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:11,010
Johnny's a bit of a jester,
but he was our first praying Indian.

296
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,326
My best friend in the colony.

297
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:15,282
Arthur,

298
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,488
- this is Mistress...
- We've already met.

299
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:20,733
Excuse me.

300
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,570
So like home.

301
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,490
Yet beyond those trees
I suspect a savagery,

302
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,691
of savage passions,

303
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,130
dark and untamed.

304
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:40,981
Reverend Dimmesdale,
have you met our young friend?

305
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:42,736
Yes, we've met.

306
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:46,095
Mistress Prynne and I
traveled out on the same ship.

307
00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:48,101
I'm going to marry him one day.

308
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:51,501
No you're not, I'm going to
aren't I Mistress Prynne?

309
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:54,901
- Marry whom?
- Reverend Dimmesdale, of course!

310
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,422
"A Short Description of the
Great and Last Judgement".

311
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,742
Well, "Platform for
Church Discipline".

312
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,823
They're all tracts!

313
00:25:30,837 --> 00:25:32,748
"The Goodwife's Manual... "

314
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:33,986
for Animal Husbandry"

315
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:37,310
I believe we've already met.

316
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:39,748
Oh, yes, I...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

317
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,796
I should have
announced my presence.

318
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:49,914
What are you reading?

319
00:25:50,123 --> 00:25:52,717
- "Comus", it's by John
- John Milton.

320
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:54,355
I know it. I've read it.

321
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:55,838
Have you?

322
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,274
I'm not all counterpanes
and coverlets.

323
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,673
Every spare moment, I read.

324
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:03,558
I'm the same.

325
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:07,321
I've read every book in this room.
Some of them several times.

326
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:09,960
Even "Manual for Animal Husbandry?"

327
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,839
A most exhiliarating read.

328
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:27,048
So, did you truly
enjoy my sermon?

329
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,766
Yes, it was most skilful.

330
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:32,204
Clearly your congregation
reverences you.

331
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:36,044
You liked it not. We don't
come up to London standards.

332
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:39,568
To the contrary.
I was moved by your passion.

333
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:41,967
And?

334
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:45,613
Well,

335
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,889
when your fist struck your hand,

336
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:54,091
and sliced through the air
like a sword,

337
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:56,296
I found myself wondering

338
00:26:56,701 --> 00:27:00,411
what manner of pain lay
beneath such forceful oratory.

339
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:05,294
Your tongue knows no rules,
Mistress Prynne.

340
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,062
And if it did, Reverend,

341
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,822
what purpose would it serve?

342
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,497
And here I thought
comprehending God

343
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,822
was to be my greatest challenge.

344
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,944
Yes, Reverend?

345
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:30,027
This morning in the forest,

346
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,501
why did you not say
you were married?

347
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:34,702
Why did you not say
you were a minister?

348
00:27:36,312 --> 00:27:38,427
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

349
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,353
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

350
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:53,432
Good morrow.

351
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,435
You care for a cup of cider?

352
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,069
We are your neighbours, it seems.

353
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,874
Did you like the sermon
this morning?

354
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,391
From where I sat it
seemed it did please thee.

355
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:07,152
I liked it very much.

356
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:09,352
I thought the
young minister very...

357
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,232
Handsome?

358
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:14,923
Harriet Hibbons.

359
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:19,154
Ruth?

360
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:22,400
How do you do?

361
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,876
Come and meet some of
the others who were not invited

362
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:27,321
to the Governer's shindig.

363
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:29,676
Sally Short, Mistress Prynne.

364
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:30,644
How do you do?

365
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,646
I was on the dock
when you arrived.

366
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,201
Mary Rollins.

367
00:28:36,371 --> 00:28:39,282
Mary don't like to speak much.

368
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:42,603
She's only been free from
the savages this half year.

369
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:46,408
And Matona don't trust
the English, do you dear?

370
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,611
Mistress Prynne?

371
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:51,044
Thank you, no.
I never imbibe.

372
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:58,051
You've gathered some fine
Balm of Gilead,

373
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:00,009
Shepherd's Purse, yarrow.

374
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:02,729
You know your plants?

375
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,890
I do. I recite "Culpepper"
by heart.

376
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,213
Really?

377
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,570
Then what would you use to
heal a bad burn?

378
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:17,057
I've seen sweet fern work miracles,

379
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:19,493
but Culpepper suggests blackberry
and red cedar.

380
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,576
Well, you hear that.

381
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:26,383
My husband has
a very large library

382
00:29:26,584 --> 00:29:28,016
and I was able to school myself.

383
00:29:29,106 --> 00:29:31,904
How do you like our new
Jerusalem?

384
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:34,778
Sober enough for you?

385
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,344
Aye,

386
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,787
sober enough.

387
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,870
What I miss is the dancing.

388
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:50,300
Dancing?

389
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:52,025
When first we came,

390
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:54,707
they'd be dancing round
the maypole.

391
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:57,302
Feast days we'd sing
bawdy songs.

392
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:59,469
People weren't afraid
to play the fool.

393
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,869
We'd teach
the bears to dance.

394
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:05,590
Now days, everybody getting more
and more sourfaced and ponderous.

395
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:10,027
And a whipping post stands
where the mayppole used to be.

396
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,307
But there's a few of us who
haven't forgotten to laugh.

397
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,629
It's been a pleasure
meeting you all.

398
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,830
I'm sorry I must take my leave,

399
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,354
but I don't want to be stuck
in the wilds at night.

400
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:28,679
There are things that sound to me,

401
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:31,114
the wilds at night are
my natural territory.

402
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:33,792
Particulary when there's
a full moon.

403
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,843
Do you try to frighten me
with this witch talk?

404
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,796
Not so, Mistress Prynne.

405
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:43,319
But I can see
what others cannot.

406
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:46,203
Be a curse, to be sure,

407
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,443
but I know the hearts of men.

408
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,007
And what does my heart tell you?

409
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,004
You're a most comely woman.

410
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:02,323
Let a man tremble
who wins the hand of a maid,

411
00:31:02,893 --> 00:31:07,090
but possesses not the
full passion of her heart.

412
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:13,124
My husband has nothing to fear.

413
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:16,053
Good day Mistress Hibbons.

414
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:21,648
Good day, Mistress Prynne.

415
00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:43,896
Good day, Goody Gotwick.

416
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:46,461
I brought these for
Reverend Dimmesdale.

417
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:49,134
The Reverend be occupied
with his work, Missus.

418
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:52,099
Leave them books on the table
and I'll be sure he gets them.

419
00:31:57,469 --> 00:31:58,981
Good morrow, Reverend.

420
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,583
Good morrow, Mistress Prynne.

421
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,580
Knowing you hunger for new reading,

422
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,907
I brought you some books.

423
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:11,344
How courteous of you.

424
00:32:14,153 --> 00:32:15,141
Please.

425
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:25,865
I must apologize for my
forthrightness on Sabbath last.

426
00:32:26,357 --> 00:32:29,827
I've earned a few reprimands
for speaking too bluntly.

427
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,871
I owe an apology, too.

428
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:39,869
I can't understand why
I took such offence

429
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:41,874
to such a simple comment.

430
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,354
But I have wondered

431
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:49,315
how you were able

432
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:52,444
to see so deeply

433
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:54,714
into my nature.

434
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,360
Perhaps I'm a witch.

435
00:33:11,051 --> 00:33:13,166
I must be keeping you
from your chores.

436
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:16,241
Thank you for the books.

437
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:17,447
Good day.

438
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:20,927
I'm sorry. My hands
are covered in ink.

439
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:23,328
I've been

440
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,292
hovered over
my translations all day.

441
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:29,811
Translations?

442
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:32,205
Aye. I'm attempting to

443
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:35,933
translate the Bible into
the local Indian language,

444
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:36,967
Algonquin.

445
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,487
What an ambitious undertaking.

446
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,257
But I'm told the Indians don't want
to be guided by our Bible.

447
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,132
That war with them is inevitable.

448
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,650
Some think that way,
but they're wrong.

449
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,819
The Indians, born from a
certain liberty,

450
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:52,853
take not easily
to bridle and bit.

451
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,617
No man should.

452
00:33:57,144 --> 00:33:57,859
Well...

453
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:06,655
What?

454
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:09,856
What?

455
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:13,745
You keep putting ink
on your face.

456
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,666
Oh, I do.

457
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:24,342
There you are.

458
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:31,230
I do hope you enjoy
the books.

459
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:33,311
Thank you.

460
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:35,544
Good day.

461
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:37,910
Good day.

462
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:05,320
Mituba?

463
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:11,473
'Tis only a bathing tub,
not a toy of Satan.

464
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:07,171
Mistress Prynne?

465
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:11,846
Reverend Dimmesdale!

466
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:16,015
- You frightened me.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

467
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:19,453
It's a wonderful surprise.

468
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,657
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, and frightening.

469
00:38:26,183 --> 00:38:27,935
Just as Eden must have been.

470
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:29,821
So untouched.

471
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,773
Does it not cry out
with it's promise,

472
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,021
that everything
can begin anew?

473
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:40,978
I brought back your books.

474
00:38:41,906 --> 00:38:43,896
You couldn't have read them all
in four days.

475
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:46,826
Oh no, I did.
I read most of them twice.

476
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:52,105
Thank you.

477
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,618
You're welcome.

478
00:38:56,151 --> 00:38:57,106
Farewell.

479
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,108
Hester...

480
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,586
I'm not the man I seem.

481
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:14,625
I've lived here all my life,
my purpose clear.

482
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:19,186
But now I'd risk everything,
my life, my ministry, my soul

483
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:21,628
just to spend a few
moments alone with you.

484
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,992
God help me, Hester.

485
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,754
I love thee.

486
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,429
God help me.
I love thee too.

487
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:38,637
Oh God. Have we lost our way?

488
00:39:39,763 --> 00:39:40,512
No!

489
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:46,274
I dreamed of thee speaking
thy heart.

490
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:49,884
I have prayed for it even as
I have dreaded it.

491
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:55,045
Was I alive before
I laid eyes on thee?

492
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,924
What shall we do?

493
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:06,005
I know not.

494
00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:09,689
Say something to end it,

495
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:11,691
for I have not the power.

496
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:15,329
Nor I.

497
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:23,411
Nay!

498
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:27,128
We could be hanged for this.

499
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,970
I've put you in too much danger,

500
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,939
and I must end it by walking away
and never speaking with you again.

501
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,778
Go then.

502
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:55,820
Do as you promised.

503
00:41:44,056 --> 00:41:47,319
Throughout the long summer,
Mistress Prynne and the Reverend

504
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:49,425
avoided each other
at all costs.

505
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:53,667
Mistress Prynne rarely went to town
and the Reverend escaped to the wilds

506
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,000
with the Indians

507
00:41:55,209 --> 00:41:57,701
and faithful Johnny Sassamon
forcompany.

508
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:03,411
And the colony organized

509
00:42:03,616 --> 00:42:05,626
it's annual election day
as usual.

510
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:08,092
No one the wiser that
there existed among them

511
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,805
two hearts struggling
against a love

512
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:13,631
that grew stronger with
each passing day.

513
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:26,645
Johnny Sassamon says they've
attacked the "Intrepid".

514
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:27,498
What's he saying,

515
00:42:27,704 --> 00:42:28,426
Arthur?

516
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:31,333
The Tarrantines

517
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:34,364
attacked an English ship,
the Intrepid.

518
00:42:36,311 --> 00:42:37,643
All were massacred.

519
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:52,629
"Prynne".

520
00:42:53,893 --> 00:42:55,628
"Doctor Roger Prynne".

521
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,143
Mistress Prynne.

522
00:43:33,702 --> 00:43:35,390
I'm here as your minister.

523
00:43:38,593 --> 00:43:39,511
Come in.

524
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,527
There was an attack,

525
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:54,909
an Indian attack on one of our ships.

526
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,120
They say that,

527
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,025
all aboard were massacred.

528
00:44:11,813 --> 00:44:13,260
I regret to be...

529
00:44:13,754 --> 00:44:15,843
the one to bring you
this sad news.

530
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:19,038
I'll leave you to your mourning.

531
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:25,550
Are you certain none survived?

532
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:29,917
They say that the tide
washed away the bodies.

533
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:31,978
God forgive me!

534
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,082
I've prayed so long to
be set free.

535
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,078
You did not cause his death, Hester.

536
00:44:40,106 --> 00:44:40,908
God...

537
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:42,605
took your husband.

538
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:45,306
But was it an answer
to my prayers?

539
00:44:45,523 --> 00:44:46,762
Does He work like that?

540
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:52,468
Perhaps.

541
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,669
If in His eyes there was no other way

542
00:44:56,879 --> 00:44:58,889
we could be together.

543
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,143
I must know what the law is.

544
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,177
The mourning, how long must one wait?

545
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,236
1 month? Six months?
What?

546
00:45:17,085 --> 00:45:20,234
Where there is no absolute
proof of death,

547
00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:26,978
7 years must pass before
we're free to be seen in public.

548
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:29,081
7 years?

549
00:45:31,232 --> 00:45:31,954
Yes...
