1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:02,998
Were the Indians
cruel to you, Mary?

2
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:06,164
After my little one died,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,165
they treated me fair and square.

4
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:11,765
If truth be told,

5
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:15,125
cruel is how you folks have
treated me since I come home.

6
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:16,163
Thank you.

7
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:19,649
I didn't do nothing
that wasn't forced on me!

8
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,887
The thought of being
taken by a savage

9
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,291
makes me sick to my stomach.

10
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,611
Well, they do it on
the backs of their horses,

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,938
ridin' across the land.

12
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:37,337
Hester, you all right?

13
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,055
Yes, I'm just tired.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,145
Mary's right.

15
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:49,028
You call them savages.

16
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:51,110
I could tell you a thing or two

17
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:54,066
about your husband
before he tied the knot with you.

18
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:56,424
Stupid slut!

19
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,786
Harold would never had nothing
to do with no whore!

20
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,078
You think not?

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,953
I've even seen
one of your windy ministers

22
00:01:06,162 --> 00:01:08,233
pokin' an Injun girl,

23
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:12,002
standin' on a bible
so he could roger her better.

24
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:15,285
They always said the Scriptures
should uplift you!

25
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:26,001
I refuse to be with those
who would mock the Holy Book!

26
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:34,445
Well,

27
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,729
she'll not be coming back soon.

28
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:38,053
Good riddance to her!

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,412
We Quakers believe that
the Scriptures be not religion,

30
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:45,262
but only the ceremony
and history of it.

31
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:46,532
I agree.

32
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:50,462
For are not the laws of men
but the imagination of mortals,

33
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,180
and the inner spirit
the true voice of Heaven?

34
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,223
Hester,

35
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:58,069
I pray you're not sayin'
you talk directly

36
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,498
to the Deity?

37
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:00,940
Don't you know that

38
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:03,621
only paid Bible-thumpers
can do that?

39
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,228
Have a care, child,

40
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,633
or they'll talking of you
the way they talk of me!

41
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:14,191
I know some consider it
blasphemous to say this,

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,913
but I do talk to God.

43
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:18,314
I have since I was a small child.

44
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:20,282
And He answers me.

45
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,205
Mistress Roger Prynne...

46
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:41,488
by order of the Governor of
Masachusetts Bay Colony,

47
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:44,730
you are ordered to appear
before the magistrates

48
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:46,484
at eight tomorrow morn!

49
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,859
Don't be tardy!

50
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:57,051
Mistress Prynne,

51
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:00,256
these gentlemen have laid a
charge ofheresy againstyou.

52
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:04,176
Tell me how it is the laws ofmen
are the imagination ofmortals?

53
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:06,138
It is the meetings
thatyou call heresy.

54
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:09,067
Lascivious talk offornication
with savages.

55
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,422
Fallen women who tell lies
about good citizens.

56
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:15,669
This is what comes when there is
no qualified man present

57
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:18,434
to guide these women
in their untutored chatterings.

58
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,948
If the discourse of women
is untutored chattering,

59
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:26,391
why does the Bible teach that women
shall be the teachers of women?

60
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:34,838
Hester, we ask that
you cease these meetings.

61
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,160
No, sirs.
I'll not stop the meetings.

62
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,477
Arthur.
Please join us.

63
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,763
I've been fishing, sir..

64
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:45,921
You may thank me to remain
where I am.

65
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,766
- Please be seated.
- Call our first witness.

66
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,606
Is it truly of import?

67
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:54,009
Yes, it is of great consequence.

68
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:56,530
Very well, call your witness.

69
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:58,405
Goody Gotwick?

70
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:01,333
Stand up, Goody.

71
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,171
You revealed to my wife
something very disturbing.

72
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,899
Tell me, what does it mean
when a woman

73
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,219
vomits in the morning hours?

74
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:17,136
And vomits more than once
in the morning hours?

75
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,418
I only saw her the one time.

76
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,268
Yes. And?

77
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:31,827
Goody Mortimer
saw her get sick in the market.

78
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:39,194
Are you with child?

79
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,032
Answer your betters, woman!

80
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,401
Do you carry a bastard child
in yur womb?

81
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,680
Yes.

82
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:09,123
Who is the father?

83
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:16,248
You are innocent next to the one
who would hide behind your skirts.

84
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,214
We would hang that fornicator!

85
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,454
I'll not reveal the name, sir.

86
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:28,857
I will tell you his name!

87
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,821
His name is Lucifer!

88
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,146
His name is Legion!

89
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,311
His name is lust!

90
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,309
Gentlemen,

91
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:49,386
What do you hope to accomplish?

92
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:51,350
You know there is no law
against pregnancy.

93
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,072
But there is against adultery.

94
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,158
It would only adultery if
her husband were found to be alive.

95
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:06,761
The meetings will stop!

96
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:07,957
Governor,

97
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:12,644
if you knew the name of this man,
would you punish Hester Prynne?

98
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:14,964
Has she confessed the name to you?

99
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,684
I've confessed nothing!

100
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:19,122
- Tell us the truth, Arthur.
- He knows nothing of my affairs.

101
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,292
He speaks as my pastor
to spare me your harsh hand.

102
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:24,247
But I fear not your punishments!

103
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:27,092
I love and honor the man who has
fathered this child!

104
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:31,774
And say what you will,
he is my true husband for life,

105
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:35,817
and I shall furnish no information
which might cause him harm.

106
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,652
Very well, you leave me no choice.

107
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:41,379
You're under arrest.

108
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,666
Is this your new Jerusalem?

109
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:02,747
Let me have a moment alone
with the woman.

110
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,669
- I can draw the name from her.
- You shall have your chance.

111
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,432
Gentlemen.

112
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:12,273
I've considered all the arguments

113
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:15,998
and decided Arthur is allowed
to speak to Mistress Prynne alone.

114
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:27,841
Hester Prynne,

115
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,929
place your hand
on the Good Book.

116
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:32,132
Let us pray.

117
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,850
Let us pray.

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,140
Why did you not tell me?

119
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:47,651
I was afraid.

120
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,540
I thought if I worked hard,
I would miscarry.

121
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,509
I must go to Bellingham
with the truth.

122
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,025
No, you must not!

123
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,671
You are a saint to these people!
They'll hang you for betraying them!

124
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,342
I prefer to hang, than allow you
to suffer for me.

125
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,152
They've no case against me!

126
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:14,552
- When they tire, they'll release me.
- I know Stonehall.

127
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,430
You've challenged him,

128
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,670
and he'll not release you

129
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,075
until you are humbled
and have recanted your sins.

130
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:24,235
Do you believe we've sinned?

131
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:30,880
I know not.

132
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:35,523
What happen between us had
a consecration. Have you forgotten?

133
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,084
I've not forgotten!

134
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:44,529
Arthur, I know you want
to speak out.

135
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,770
Your nature cries out for it.

136
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,887
But you risk your own ruin
and deny me

137
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,565
my right to stand up
to this hypocrisy.

138
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:53,894
Soldier!

139
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:06,942
If I need you to speak,

140
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:10,056
I'll tie this handkerchief
from the window.

141
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,989
I love thee woman,

142
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,583
but your strength frightens me.

143
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,273
I'll do what you ask.

144
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,588
Amen.

145
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,724
God be with you.

146
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,686
I'm sure he already is.

147
00:09:58,975 --> 00:09:59,964
Gentlemen,

148
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:03,128
Mistress Prynne has been there
more than 5 months

149
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,248
without any legal justification.

150
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:08,929
Even in Plymouth they regard this
as barbaric!

151
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,337
I'd like to free her.
At home, I have no peace on this.

152
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,819
But the people see us go to her
week after week, caps in hand,

153
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,094
only to be turned away.

154
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,102
The woman is unrepentant!

155
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:23,104
She's fortunate we haven't
beaten her publicly!

156
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:26,426
I'm surprised at you Reverend.
You came here a man of reason.

157
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:30,865
I came here expecting
some semblance of order.

158
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:33,752
Instead I find
a den of fractiousness!

159
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:36,704
Sir, if you do not
stem this dissent,

160
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,792
my wife and I will return
to England.

161
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:43,073
And take our parishioners!

162
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,034
If only she would give us

163
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,072
a small sign of contrition.

164
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,355
Ifit had been up to him,
my father,

165
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:57,240
he would have ended it and
revealed the truth ofmy origins.

166
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:01,160
But bound by my mother's wish,
he could not.

167
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:07,800
He went every day to see her
and was refused.

168
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:12,605
His eye everon that window
forhersign that it was time

169
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:15,489
to come forward with the truth.

170
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:20,321
Had there been flashes ofPrynne's
unstable nature before

171
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:21,593
in England?

172
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:23,475
No one knows.

173
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,398
But now, free from
Puritan society,

174
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,405
he was increasingly seized
by spirits so powerful

175
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:36,128
they were terrifying
even to the Indians.

176
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,735
He has a ghost in him.

177
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:50,775
He'll bring us bad luck.

178
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,175
Send him home.

179
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,579
Forgive me, Lord,

180
00:13:58,065 --> 00:14:00,739
forI have turned from
my Heavenly Father.

181
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:02,943
Forgive me.

182
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,139
Lord, bring me back to thy bosom.

183
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:13,188
God's teeth, child!
How could they leave you thus?

184
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,066
I'm so glad you're here!

185
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,866
6 months and not one visitor.

186
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,992
Some of us came, my dear,
but we were turned away.

187
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,397
Your slave came every day.
How quick are the pains?

188
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,319
- They're not stopping.
- Here.

189
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:28,359
Take a sip of this.

190
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,557
I wager you won't refuse
my cider this time.

191
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:36,325
Rvd. Dimmesdale tried always
to get you freed.

192
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:37,876
- Another?
- Yes.

193
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:41,366
All right, breathe deep.
Breathe deep.

194
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,722
Hold on to me!
Good girl!

195
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,889
Easy, easy.

196
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:48,127
Let me see.

197
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:51,685
All's well. All's well.
It's close.

198
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:54,490
It's very close.
Come, my dear. It's time.

199
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:55,607
Up you sit.

200
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,529
Good girl. There.

201
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,575
Move down a little.
Good.

202
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,096
This child is ready to be born.

203
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,735
We've work to do!

204
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:06,299
There.

205
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,780
How could they
keep me here so long?

206
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,174
Well, I'll say this,

207
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:16,097
you must have a will of iron.

208
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:19,707
When you take on the men,
it leads to death.

209
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:24,063
All right, my dear.
Chin down and bear down hard!

210
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:26,662
More and harder!

211
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:29,628
Harder! Good!

212
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:33,187
Good girl. That's it.

213
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:34,958
Easy.

214
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,872
Easy.

215
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:38,719
Good. Easy.

216
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,518
Are you sure
God's not punishing me?

217
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:49,195
To be sure he's punishing you.

218
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,085
He be giving you a child!.

219
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:54,244
Now. Gently.

220
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,321
Now the head is coming.

221
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,450
The head is through.

222
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,609
Just a little more.
Easy.

223
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:02,811
Easy. Easy.

224
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,097
She'd here!

225
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,456
Oh, thank you, God!

226
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:21,020
Yes!

227
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:25,377
Little Pearl.
Yes!

228
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:26,576
Yes!

229
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,947
Harriet, she's here!

230
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:31,024
She's here.

231
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,437
Sit there, Mistress.

232
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,604
Proceed, Reverend.

233
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,887
I'll have them fetch fresh clothes
for you and the babe.

234
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:35,220
I bring good news.

235
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:38,547
I've prevailed upon the Governor.

236
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:40,659
You are to be freed.

237
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,949
But by law...

238
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:49,549
you'll be brought to the scaffold

239
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:52,233
for reprimand.

240
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:55,872
Hester.

241
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:58,235
Whatever is said,

242
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,149
please,

243
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:03,315
be as contrite as
your conscience permits.

244
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,477
If not for my sake,
for the babe's.

245
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:09,276
I beg you,
don't anger them further!

246
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:16,878
I've come to baptize
the babe.

247
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:38,897
I've died not seeing you.

248
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,214
I came every day.

249
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:20,320
I baptize this child,

250
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:24,920
Pearl.

251
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:27,882
Pearl.

252
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,442
In the name of the Father,

253
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:40,689
and the son,

254
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:45,014
and the Holy Ghost.

255
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,856
May the Lord bless thee,

256
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,934
and care for thee,

257
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:56,220
and watch over thee.

258
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:01,415
Amen.

259
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,583
Freeing this woman

260
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:14,070
is an invitation to every wife

261
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:16,184
to defy her husband.

262
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,345
Every child it's parent!

263
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,507
No, she should be released.

264
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:21,553
What?

265
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,790
You don't put her in prison,

266
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,468
you put the prison in her.

267
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,637
So each time someone sees her,

268
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:31,714
her sin will be marked into
her soul afresh.

269
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:43,156
Cunningly contrived, my dear.

270
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,242
Make way in the King's name.

271
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:51,923
A blessing on the righteous
Colony of Massachusetts,

272
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:55,771
where iniquity is dragged
into the sunlight!

273
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:59,210
Know ye

274
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:01,807
that Mistress Roger Prynne

275
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:04,535
has been ordered

276
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,252
to bear punishment for
fornication and adultery.

277
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:14,412
If it be determined later

278
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:16,423
that her husband be still alive,

279
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:19,346
she may face a most severe penalty,

280
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,348
which is to be hanged by the neck
until dead.

281
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:26,308
Pray, silence,
for his Excellency,

282
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:27,740
the Governor.

283
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:29,945
Hester Prynne,

284
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,191
though you show no
modesty in you apparel,

285
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:38,391
yet you have a chance, still,
to repent your sins.

286
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:40,590
Yes, Hester, repent!

287
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:45,802
Child, don't you believe
you have sinned?

288
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,677
I believe I have sinned
in your eyes,

289
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:54,961
but who is to know if God
shares your views?

290
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:56,277
Woman,

291
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,324
transgress not the limits
of Heaven's mercy!

292
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,208
Reverend Dimmesdale,
you are her pastor.

293
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:06,123
Speak to her for all our sakes!

294
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:10,366
Soften her, her hardness
her obstinacy!

295
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,298
Listen to the Reverend!

296
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,092
Speak to the woman, my brother.

297
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,890
Exalt her to confess the truth!

298
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:28,143
Hester Prynne,

299
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:32,297
you hear what these
good men say,

300
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:36,180
and see the accountablity
under which I labor.

301
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,701
For your soul's peace,

302
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,631
I charge thee

303
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:47,071
speak out the name

304
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:49,428
of your fellow sinner.

305
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:56,553
Be not silent

306
00:22:56,762 --> 00:23:00,073
for some mistaken pity
or tenderness for him.

307
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:02,799
For believe me, if he could

308
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:05,885
step down and stand beside you
on your pedestal of shame,

309
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:07,847
it would be better than to

310
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,728
carry a guilty heart
through life.

311
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:17,331
What can your silence
do for him,

312
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:21,366
except to tempt him?

313
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:23,890
And compel him

314
00:23:24,376 --> 00:23:26,845
to add hypocrisy to sin?

315
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,859
Speak.

316
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,542
She will not speak.

317
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:51,346
In the name of the Lord,
name him!

318
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:53,345
Name him!

319
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:58,352
- His name!
- What is his name?

320
00:23:58,556 --> 00:24:00,274
Who might he be?

321
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:14,604
Very well.

322
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:15,994
Beadle!

323
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,199
Mistress, if you do not speak out

324
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:20,875
his name, wear upon your bodice

325
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:24,086
this symbol of your sinful
fornication.

326
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:38,007
Heed not this

327
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,895
final warning,

328
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:42,334
and you will be a pariah,

329
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,494
cut off, shunned
and reviled by every man,

330
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:47,977
woman and child in this town!

331
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,740
Why do you wait?
Put it on!

332
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,940
It is not a badge of my shame,
but your own!

333
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,611
What do you want?

334
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:55,330
Have I changed so much,
my beloved,

335
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,017
that you would slay me as I
resurrect myself from the dead?

336
00:26:04,746 --> 00:26:05,781
Roger?

337
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,031
Hester.

338
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,715
Was I ever unkind to you?

339
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:37,915
Did I not love thee?

340
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,601
Did I not see thee
above all womanhood?

341
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:44,846
Are you not bound to me
by sacred oath?

342
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:48,646
Or has this new land turned thee
into a heathen?

343
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:57,892
Lay our bed will thou, wife.

344
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:24,977
Pray for thy sins, Hester Prynne.

345
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:27,499
Beg the Lord to forgive
thy corruption.

346
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:31,625
Pray and I'll wash thee
as white as snow.

347
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:37,309
White as snow, my love.

348
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,195
White as snow.

349
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,113
White as snow.

350
00:28:28,264 --> 00:28:29,014
Arthur?

351
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:37,218
Hester?

352
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,021
Thank God you're here!

353
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,264
- Why are you taking this risk?
- I had to warn you.

354
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,827
My husband is alive.

355
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:47,467
Dear God!

356
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,064
Alive?

357
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,314
Now we'll hang for certain.

358
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,436
Why would he show up at this moment
if he wasn't God's dark messenger,

359
00:28:58,721 --> 00:29:00,394
sent to punish us.

360
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:03,790
Arthur, you must leave without us.

361
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,995
I cannot bear to see you
trapped here,

362
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,001
under his watchful eye forever.

363
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:12,842
Hester, I must stay
and watch over you and Pearl.

364
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:14,880
No. You don't know him.

365
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,050
He'll wait for us to
betray each other

366
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,561
with the slightest glance
or the merest gesture.

367
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:21,968
Please. You must go!

368
00:29:23,373 --> 00:29:26,286
This God's punishment,

369
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:30,256
because we tried to run
from His Will.

370
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:48,305
I will not say farewell, Hester.

371
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:51,708
Pray God watch over you.

372
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,343
And so will I.

373
00:29:58,474 --> 00:30:01,431
Kiss Pearl for me each night.

374
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:32,450
'Tis easy to see
the mother's part in her.

375
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:35,883
Is it beyond research,
I wonder,

376
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:39,246
to analyze her nature,
and from it's make and mold,

377
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:42,409
give a shrewd guess
as to the father?

378
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:45,371
What are your expectations?

379
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,255
I do not expect your heart
to return to you quickly.

380
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:53,378
But I hope one day
you will draw me again

381
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,580
into your heart.

382
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:58,902
Love has forced me to open
my heart to another.

383
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:00,937
Watch your tongue, woman!

384
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:04,106
'Tis this phantom lover who
puts these words into your mouth1

385
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:05,139
Where is he?

386
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:06,305
Is his kiss

387
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,467
still wet on your lips,
on your breast?

388
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:11,750
- I demand to know!
- If I spent 6 months in a cold jail,

389
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,945
and did not tell these iron men,

390
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:15,828
what makes you think
I'll tell you now?

391
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:18,749
These trials have made me strong!

392
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:21,426
And I am not the child
you married!

393
00:31:22,199 --> 00:31:25,078
Why not announce yourself openly
and cast me off at once.

394
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:26,111
No, no.

395
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:29,476
I seek no vengeance against you.

396
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:32,882
But the man lives
who wronged us both.

397
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,725
He bears no letter of infamy

398
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:36,921
wrought into his garment.

399
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:40,606
But I shall read it on his heart.

400
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,445
Breathe one word to him
of my true identity,

401
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:47,127
and you will both hang.

402
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:49,610
If you try to escape,

403
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:51,044
you will be easily found.

404
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:52,333
Easily!

405
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:56,575
From the savages

406
00:31:56,777 --> 00:31:59,212
I have learned patience,

407
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:01,219
Hester Prynne.

408
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:40,393
Goody Gotwick, thank you.

409
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:56,960
Reverend, allow me to introduce
our newest boarder,

410
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:58,126
Doctor Chilling...

411
00:32:58,332 --> 00:33:00,244
- Chillingworth.
- Chillingworth.

412
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,969
Good day, man.

413
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:04,403
Good day, sir.

414
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:11,174
What brings you
to our colony, sir?

415
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:14,896
I'm a physician, sir.
I would cleanse the ills

416
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:16,774
of the community.

417
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,736
Have I said something strange?

418
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:25,942
No.

419
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,627
I'm amazed.

420
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,426
We have prayed
for a skilled physician.

421
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:40,948
I see you are translating
the Bible into Algonquin.

422
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:45,876
A most difficult tongue
to master.

423
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,906
If I can be of help, Reverend.

424
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,351
I am fluent in Algonquin.

425
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:56,319
- Fluent?
- Yes.

426
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:58,994
I was a prisoner of the Tarrantine.

427
00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:01,004
When I spoke improperly,
I was whipped.

428
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,767
I learned quite rapidly.

429
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:07,407
How were you captured?

430
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,369
I was working my farm in Virginia.
They came,

431
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:15,725
killed my wife, Eleanor,
God rest her soul,

432
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,766
and our infant son,

433
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:20,891
and sold me into captivity.

434
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,738
It's a wonder you're not consumed

435
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:29,819
with bitterness and despair.

436
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:33,263
No, no. In truth,
I am indebted to the Indians.

437
00:34:33,544 --> 00:34:37,016
Some say they are savages,
but true savagery,

438
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:39,702
I find resides elsewhere.

439
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:51,710
Mistress Roger Prynne.

440
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:55,034
Mistress Prynne.

441
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:02,236
And what is your duty, boy?

442
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,120
Follow you around, Mistress.

443
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,797
Well, at least they'll
make a path for me.

444
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,174
Whore!

445
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,337
God will punish you, sinner!

446
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,895
Jezebel!

447
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:43,336
You're not welcome here!

448
00:35:43,902 --> 00:35:46,177
Be gone, Hester Prynne!

449
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:56,819
Soap, please. Three pieces.

450
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:26,043
Although he wore no outward
symbol ofhis shame,

451
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:29,997
my father wore his own scarlet
letteron the bosom ofhis soul.

452
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,921
The pain oftheirseparation
must have affected us all.

453
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:37,692
I was a troublesome child.

454
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:40,729
My fatherached formy mother,

455
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:44,206
and filled his loneliness
in the wilds with Johnny.

456
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,815
They struggled

457
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:47,689
to keep alive theirdream

458
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:49,337
ofbuilding a bridge
between English and Indian.

459
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,175
Johnny,

460
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,298
why are they so close to town?

461
00:36:55,902 --> 00:36:58,782
They say our people have
fallen asleep.

462
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:01,938
So they must remain awake
for all of us.

463
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:05,862
I'm worried.

464
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:08,261
Is war coming?

465
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,349
The great experiment
is not working, is it?
