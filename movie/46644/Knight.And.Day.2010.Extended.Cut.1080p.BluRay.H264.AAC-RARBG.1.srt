18
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,058

So, I'm gonna make it onto the earlier flight, right?

19
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,434
行李要拖运吗？

30
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,547

抱歉，座位真的全满了
I'm sorry, we are completely sold out.

50
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,106
你能帮我想想办法吗？我小妹耶
Listen, can you help me out for a second? She's my little sister.

51
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,608
她叫艾波儿，我是茱恩
She's April, I'm June,

52
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,693
她等着我明天陪她走红毯

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,070
好温馨
That's very sweet,

54
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,864
搭11点50分的晚班机 您明早就会抵达
but the 11:50 will get you there tomorrow morning with plenty of time.

55
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,908
登机证，先生？

56
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,454
有时事出必有因

Would all passengers holding a valid boarding pass, please proceed...

63
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:49,724
我早该料到，他起肖到失控了
I should've seen it coming, boss. He went on tilt, he came undone.

64
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,269
我们这行如果失控大不了喝个几杯
Coming undone in our business means you need a margarita.

65
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,813
不是在政府实验室干掉一票人后
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people in a government lab 

66
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,855
再把它炸掉
and blowing it up.

67
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,275
不是就能窃取重大机密
It doesn't mean stealing an object of critical importance.

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,734
他到底有没有偷走赛佛？
Does he have the Zephyr or not?

69
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
我们相信有
We believe so.

70
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
你相信有
You believe so.

71
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,574
看一下
Check it out.

72
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,908
我不在乎你相信什么，费兹
I don't care what you believe, Fitz.

73
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,076
收拾好你的烂摊子
I need you to clean your mess up.

74
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,160
倒带再放一次
Go back and play it again.

75
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,328
我要拿到赛佛
I want the Zephyr.

76
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,914
我们会在他抵达波士顿时拿到手
We'll have it in hand by the time he lands in Boston.

77
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,126
查出她的身分和背景
Find out who and what she is.

78
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,962
要请威奇塔的分处逮捕她吗？
Should I have the field office pick her up in Wichita?

79
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,339
我有更好的主意
I got a better idea.

80
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,343
赫文斯小姐
Miss Havens? 

81
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,512
我们替您找到机位了
We did find a seat for you.

82
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,017
请注意，抱歉延误起飞
I'd like to have your attention, please. We apologize for the delay.

83
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,603
我们很快会从威奇塔机场出发
We will be departing Wichita Airport shortly.

84
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,770
“移动，警告”


85
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,147
感谢您的耐心
Thanks for your patience.

86
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,775
“艾玛波拉路5826号”


87
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,778
我知道你只是依照公司政策做事
I know it's policy or whatever and it's just your job,

88
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,614
但这实在有点瞎
but it's kind of lame.

89
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,740
真是抱歉
Again, I apologize.

90
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,159
费兹，你动了什么手脚？
Fitz. What did you do?

91
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,041
难怪航空公司会倒
It's no wonder these airlines are going out of business.

92
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,544
飞机上只有小猫两三只
We have been cleared onto the runway. There's nobody on the plane.

93
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,555
机长已开殷系好安全带指示灯
The captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.

94
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,350
请坐在位置上直到指示灯熄灭
Please remain seated until the sign has been turned off

95
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,560
才能在机舱内走动
and it's safe to move about the cabin.

96
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,021
对了，我是茱恩
I'm June, by the way.

97
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,689
我是罗伊米勒
I'm Roy Miller.

98
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,107
幸会
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,192
彼此彼此
It's very nice to meet you.

100
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,153
龙舌兰加冰块？
Tequila on the rocks?

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,030
好，正是时候，谢了
Yeah. Just in time, thanks.

102
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,370
所以你小妹明天结婚？
So, your sister's getting married tomorrow?

103
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,830
-什么？ -你小妹
-Excuse me? -Your sister.

104
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,500
她明天结婚，恭喜
She's getting married tomorrow. Congratulations.

105
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,918
是啊，谢了
Yeah, thanks.

106
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,176
罗伊，我不善于说谎
You know, Roy, I'm a bad liar.

107
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,095
抱歉，怎么说？
I'm sorry, how's that?

108
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,181
艾波儿要结婚，不过是周六
April is getting married, but not till Saturday.

109
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,474
你唬到我了
You had me fooled.

110
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,060
可是我明天要试装
Well, I do have a fitting tomorrow. 

111
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,896
所以我真的得回家
So, I do, actually, have to go home.

112
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,781
希望这趟飞行别太难熬
I hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.

113
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,412
很难说
It might be.

114
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,875
跑来威奇塔买化油器还真远
Wichita is a long way to go for a carburetor.

115
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,794
这可不是一般的化油器
It's not just any carburetor. 

116
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,920
是三段式化油器
It's a triple deuce.

117
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,089
我在整理1966年的GTO
I'm restoring a '66 GTO.

118
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,591
堪萨斯州有最棒的零件厂
And Kansas has the best scrap.

119
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,718
真的？
Really?

120
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,386
我爸开修车厂
My dad had a garage,

121
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,264
我小时候，他买了这台车的底盘
and when I was a kid, he bought this chassis.

122
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,435
他经常带我们到处找零件
He used to take us to yards, and search for parts, you know?

123
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,272
他于1998年过世，如今艾波儿结婚
He died in '98, and now that April's getting married

124
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,442
我心想，何不把车整理好？
I just figured, why not finish it up,

125
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,944
送她当作结婚礼物
give it to her sort of as a wedding present?

126
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,114
也算是老爸送的礼物
Kind of like a present from our dad, too, you know?

127
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,075
好感人
That's nice.

128
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,994
-是啊 -是啊
-Yeah. -Yeah.

129
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,630
我常想
I used to think that

130
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,803
有朝一日，当最后的零件装上
someday, when the last part went in,

131
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,974
我会爬进那台车，发动它
I would just climb into that GTO and start it up.

132
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,854
一股劲儿地开，不停地开
Just drive and drive and drive, and just keep driving

133
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,316
直到抵达南美洲的尽头
until I got to the tip of South America.

134
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,318
合恩角
Cape Horn.

135
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,320
对
Yeah.

136
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,655
那里有美丽的岛屿
There's beautiful islands down there.

137
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,990
是吗？
Yeah?

138
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,283
海盗岛
Pirate islands.

139
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,207
“有朝一日”是个危险字眼
Yeah, "someday." That's a dangerous word.

140
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,000
危险？
Dangerous?

141
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,046
它其实只是“永不”的代名词
It's really just code for "never."

142
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,468
我常在想我还有什么事没做过
I think a lot about things I haven't done.

143
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,348

只有摩托车和背包相伴

146
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,524
在海角酒店阳台亲吻陌生人

147
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,694

Where is that?

148
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,655
南法
South of France.

149
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,576
那你呢？
What about you? 

150
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,411
你想做哪些事？
What's your list?

151
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,250
这个嘛…你的听起来很不赖
Well, yours sounds pretty good.

152
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,505
天啊
Wow.

153
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,675
谢了
Thanks.

154
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,718
别客气
It's no problem.

155
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,681
不介意的话我放在这里
I'll just put this up here, if that's all right.

156
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,895
不好意思
You know what?

157
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,190
我要去化妆室整理一下
I'm gonna go back and use the restroom.

158
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,734
我帮你
I'll help you.

159
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,236
谢了
Thanks.

160
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,870
乱流真多
Lots of turbulence, huh?

161
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,878
-我马上出来 -没问题
-I'll be out in a minute. -Sure

162
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,017
“在海角酒店阳台亲吻陌生人”
"Kiss a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Cap"?

163
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,768
这是什么台词？
I mean, what kind of a line is that?

164
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,570
太浪漫了
I mean, it's, like, a really good line.

165
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,452
小姐？小姐？
Ma'am? Ma'am?

166
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,630
你有没有看见他的手？
Did you see his hands, by any chance?

167
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,424
一下子就接住袋子
They just, like, snatched that bag right out of the air.

168
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,426
超快的反射动作
Lightning-fast reflexes.

169
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,264
太不上道
Not cool.

170
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,894
好
Okay.

171
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,958
这会有帮助
This will help.

172
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,226
够了，结束了，罗伊
Enough. It's over, Roy.

173
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,187
我同意，够了
Yeah, I agree. Enough.

174
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,022
赛佛在哪里？
Where's the Zephyr?

175
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,212
那女的为什么在机上？快说
Why is the girl on the plane? Tell me.

176
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,089
为什么费兹安排她上机？
Why did Fitz put her on the plane?

177
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,635
别动，米勒
Don't move, Miller.

178
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,983
好，你打算怎么做？ 你打算怎么做？
So what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

179
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,861
你打算让这机会溜掉？
You're just gonna let this opportunity pass you by?

180
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,945
不，当然不行
No, of course you're not.

181
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,322
你要走出去，主动一点
You're gonna walk right through that door, you're gonna get it right.

182
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,741
反正你也不是第一次主动
It's not your first rodeo, woman.

183
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,589
嗨
Hey.

184
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,474
我决定也来一杯
I decided to join you.

185
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,753
抱歉，我…
I'm sorry. I...

186
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,880
不，没关系…这样很棒
No, no, don't... It's great.

187
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,964
抱歉
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,674
龙舌兰和在高空都会令人兴奋
It's just, like, the tequila and the altitude and everything.

189
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,134
我得告诉你一件事
There's something I've gotta tell you.

190
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,804
什么？天啊，你有女朋友了
What? Oh, my God, you're in a relationship. 

191
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,930
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

192
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,557
不是，不是那样
No, no, no. That's not it.

193
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,644
不是？我洗耳恭听，是啥？
Okay, I'm all ears. What is it?

194
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,107
我们要降落了吗？
Are we landing?

195
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,526
还没
No, not yet.

196
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,487
还没？
No?

197
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,823
听着，不需要惊慌
Listen, there's no need to panic. 

198
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,701
我已经…控制情况
I have contained the situation.

199
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,162
情况？
Situation?

200
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,500
对，我们…失去了机长
Yeah. We've lost the pilots.

201
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,211
他们去哪了？
Where did they go?

202
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,505
应该是说他们死了
I mean, they're dead.

203
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,799
-机长死了 -被射杀
-The pilots are dead. -Shot. It's...

204
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,509
被射杀？
Shot?

205
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,512
谁干的？
By who?

206
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,517
就是我
Well, me.

207
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,019
实际上我杀了正驾驶
Actually, I shot the first pilot.

208
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,230
他意外杀了副驾驶
He shot the second pilot accidentally. 

209
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,857
你懂…
It's just

210
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,862
就是这么回事
one of those things.

211
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,755
说真的，这个好笑！
Seriously, this is great!

212
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,009
我大可放心了，你好镇静
Really, I'm relieved you are taking this so well.

213
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,391
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

214
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,519
我去看一下，想办法降落
I'm just gonna go check on things and think about landing.

215
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,605
能帮个忙系上安全带吗？
Would you mind putting your seatbelt on for me?

216
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,231
-那就太好了 -好
-That would be great. -Yeah.

217
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,457
太诡异了
This is weird.

218
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,473
求救，求救
Mayday. Mayday. 

219
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,807
美国米德兰航空77号班机
This is US Midland Air 77 heavy.

220
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,934
这是怎么回事？
What's happening? 

221
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,602
机内每个人真的都死了！
Everybody's dead out there!

222
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,854
过来，坐下
Come on in. Sit down. 

223
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,022
求救，求救，求救
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

224
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,190
这里每个人都死了
Everybody's dead in here.

225
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,274
这是紧急事件
I'm declaring an emergency.

226
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,901
我的天啊！我们会坠机吗？
Oh, my God! Are we going down?

227
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,985
什么？
I'm sorry?

228
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,070
我们会坠机吗？
Are we going down?

229
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,530
茱恩，只是快速下降，请坐下
No, June, it's just a rapid descent. Please, sit down.

230
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,951
抱歉，我想我听够这家伙了
I'm sorry, I think I've heard enough of this guy.

231
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,994
你是飞行员吗？你是谁？
Are you a pilot? Who are you?

232
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,287
肩带
The shoulder straps.

233
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,956
把这个戴好
You can put those over, 

234
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,791
从右边扣在座位上
and it clicks in right down there.

235
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,460
要扣在那里，没错
You wanna click it right there, that's it.

236
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,463
好，我弄好了
Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay...

237
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,340
放下起落架，慢下来
Gear down, showdown.

238
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,302
我们干嘛不降落在机场？
Why can't we just land in an airport?

239
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,805
不，最好不要
No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea.

240
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,181
他们会等着我们
They'll be waiting for us.

241
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,642
什么意思？等着我们？谁？
What do you mean? Waiting for us?  Who? 

242
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,519
我想你知道愈少愈好
I think the less you know, the better.

243
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,312
什么？
What?

244
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,690
好，我们要在这里降落了
Okay, we're gonna touch down here.

245
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,941
天啊！
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

246
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,408
-有卡车，有卡车！ -好
-That's a truck. That's a truck! -Yeah.

247
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,701
-有卡车！ -没错
-That's a truck! -Yup.

248
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,827
有卡车！
That's a truck!

249
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,708
我的天啊！我的天啊！
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

250
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,465
-有弯路，有弯路！ -我看到了
-That's a curve. That's a curve! -I see it. I see it.

251
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,141
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

252
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,311
天啊！
Oh, God!

253
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,578
太好了
Okay, this is good.

254
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,163
哪里好？
What's good?

255
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,751
喝一口
Take a sip of that.

256
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,878
可以放松一下
It'll take the edge off.

257
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
你中弹了？
Are you shot?

258
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
对，免骛啦
Yeah, how about that?

259
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,557
只是擦伤，这是好消息
It's just a scrape. That's good news.

260
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,727
茱恩，我们需要…
June, we have to

261
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,105
讨论下一步
discuss what's gonna happen next.

262
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,025
你需要去医院，不然去监狱？
You need to go to the hospital. Prison, maybe?

263
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,403
有些人会来找你，坏人
Some people are gonna come looking for you now. Bad people.

264
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,280
我感觉怪怪的
You know, I feel a little weird.

265
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,283
对，过几分钟你就会昏倒
Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep, which should be in a couple of minutes.

266
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,702
-什么？ -我要你听好
-What? -I need you to listen, June.

267
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,371
你对我下药？
Did you drug me?

268
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,705
对
Yes.

269
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,208
-你对我下药 -对，为了你着想
-You drugged me. -Yeah, it's for your own good.

270
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,920
这些坏人会找上你，他们会问起我
Now, look. These bad people who are going to come and see you, they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?

271
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,090
你得回答你不认识我
And you need to tell them you don't know me.

272
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,758
莱恩？
-June? June? -Okay.

273
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,802
你得说你什么都不记得
You need to tell them you don't remember anything.

274
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,888
你无论如何要避免上他们的车
And you need to avoid getting in any vehicle with them at all costs.

275
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,807
好，  “他们”是谁？
Okay, who are "them"?

276
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,558
他们是狠角色
Well, they're serious people, June.

277
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,478
他们会自称是联邦调查局探员
They'll probably identify themselves as federal agents, 

278
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
他们会误导你
and they'll DIP you.

279
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,440
误导我怎样？
Dip me? In what?

280
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,734
反情报规则，他们会瞎掰我的事
Dis-Information Protocol. They'll tell you a story about me.

281
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,821
说我精神不稳定、有妄想症
About how I'm mentally unstable, paranoid.

282
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,698
暴力又危险
How I'm violent and dangerous, 

283
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,784
听起来都很像真的
and it'll all sound very convincing.

284
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,619
我已经被说服了
I'm already convinced.

285
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,705
一些基本的关键字会出现
There's a few common DIP keywords to listen for.

286
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,873
安慰的字眼
Reassuring words. Words like, 

287
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,836
比如稳定、确保、安全
"stabilize," "secure," "safe."

288
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,295
只要他们提到这些字眼
If they say these words, 

289
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,380
尤其重覆时…
particularly with repetition...

290
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,506
好
Okay.

291
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,966
这表示他们会杀了你
...it means they're going to kill you.

292
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,092
天啊！
Oh, God!

293
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,512
或者把你长期关到境外某处
Or intern you somewhere offshore for a very long time.

294
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,721
-懂吗？ -懂
-Okay? -Okay.

295
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,807
仔细听我说，只要他们说你很安全…
Now, stay with me. If they tell you you're safe...

296
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,934
如果他们说我很安全
If they tell me I'm safe,

297
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,978
他们会杀了我
they're gonna kill me.

298
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,354
别上什么？
Don't get in what? 

299
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,564
上车
Vehicles.

300
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:32,898
任何车
Any vehicles.

301
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,024
好，任何车
Okay, any vehicles.

302
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,359
-要快点逃 -我会逃
-Just run. -I'll run.

303
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,527
快逃-快逃
-Run. -Run.

304
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,696
要是他们问起我…
And if they ask you about me...

305
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,366
我不认识你
I don't know you. 

306
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,659
我完全不认识你
I don't know you at all.

307
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,704
罗伊，你到底是谁？
Who are you, Roy?

308
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,197
“茱恩，很高兴认识你，罗伊”


309
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,709
…混着雨和雪，适合滑雪区
... a mixing of rain and snow, good for ski country, but probably...

310
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,002
“吃顿丰盛早餐，茱恩”


311
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,378
-谢了，安卓 -不答气
-Thanks, Andrea. -You're welcome.

312
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,339
接着回到今早的头条新闻
Now, back to our top news story of the morning.

313
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,217
布莱德利摩斯在现场报导
Here's Bradley Moss, with an on-the-scene report.

314
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,845
根据联邦航空局的消息 昨晚约7点半时
According to FAA sources, at approximately 7:30 last night,

315
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,849
与威奇塔飞往波士顿的一架客机 失去所有联系
all contact was lost with a Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita.

316
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,061
这架飞机显然飞经不稳定气流
The plane was apparently passing through an area of turbulence

317
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,187
可能遭乱流或闪电影响
and may have met up with wind shear

318
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,564
造成断电
or a lightning storm causing an electrical failure.

319
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,108
目前一切都还是推测
Now, this is all conjecture at this point,

320
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,236
证据只有… 在印地安那州玉米田中的残骸
as all that's left is a crater in an Indiana cornfield.

321
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,737
来了
Coming!

322
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,239
“记得，别告诉任何人”


323
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,912
罗德尼？
Rodney?

324
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,582
谢天谢地，我想确定你安然无恙
Thank God. I wanted to make sure you were okay.

325
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,708
怎么了？
Yeah, why?

326
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,043
你不是昨天从堪萨斯飞回来？
You were on that flight from Kansas, right?

327
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,003
-对 -我看新闻说坠机了
-Yeah. -I saw on the news about the crash.

328
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,588
什么新闻？什么坠机？
What news? What crash?

329
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,384
-没事了，你活着就好 -我活着没错
-Anyway, you're alive. -I'm alive, yeah.

330
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:28,097
-我看到了，太好了 -茱恩，我在想…
Sure, that's cool. Hey, but, June, you know...

331
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,891
我告诉自己，只要得知你活着
I told myself that if I found you alive,

332
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,936
我要邀你共进晚餐
that I was gonna ask you to dinner.

333
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,022
罗德尼，人分手以后 就不应该再约会
Rodney, people, when they break up, they're not supposed to have dates

334
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,025
那就别说是约会 说消防检查好了
so don't call it a date. Call it a fire inspection!

335
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,945
我晚点打给你好吗？
How about I call you later, okay?

336
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,617
不要告诉别人我在说什么
Don't tell anybody. What I'm talking about.

337
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,636
只是又一天，平常的一天，没事
It's just another day. It's just a normal day. Okay.

338
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,390
威尔莫，我有好东西
Hey, Willmer. I've got some goodies.

339
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,310
天啊，你拿到化油器了
Jesus, you got the deuce

340
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,646
威尔莫，当我回来时会来拿
Will, I'll grab it when I get back in

341
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,984
没事，只不过又是一天
Everything's OK! It's just another day

342
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,530
没事
Nothing happened.

343
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
目标移动中
She's moving.

344
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,340
天啊！
Wow!

345
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,301
靴子真是可爱
And gotta love the boots.

346
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,304
不好意思
Yeah, you know.

347
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,765
我保证当天会穿高跟鞋
I promise I'll wear heels on the day.

348
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,808
-能跟你谈一下吗？ -好
-Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? -Yeah.

349
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,273
这个周末，我想到爸的庞帝克
So, this weekend, I was thinking about Dad's GTO.

350
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,777
-真的？ -对，就一直停在车库里
-Really? -Yeah, it's just sitting there.

351
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,031
我想问你愿意卖掉它吗？
And I was wondering how you would feel about maybe selling it.

352
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,117
你想卖掉爸的庞帝克？
You wanna sell Dad's GTO?

353
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,953
我和班很想拥有自己的家
Ben and I, we really want our own place.

354
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,163
请问一下？
Excuse me?

355
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:20,084
请问一下 外面那台蓝色货车是谁的？
Excuse me. Anyone here belong to that blue truck parked outside?

356
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,419
-是我的，怎么了？ -你快被开罚单了
-Yeah, why? -You're about to get a ticket.

357
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,089
-我以为钱有投够 -嗯
-Thought I put enough quarters in there. -Yeah.

358
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,257
我最讨厌接到罚单
I hate getting tickets.

359
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,468
不好意思
Excuse me.

360
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,141
请跟我们上车，小姐
Please step inside, miss.

361
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,437
我去拿些东西
Let me just go grab a few things.

362
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,774
赫文斯小姐，午安 我是费兹杰罗探员
Miss Havens, good afternoon. Special Agent-in-Charge, Fitzgerald.

363
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,860
请跟我们上车
Will you join us inside the car for a moment?

364
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,988
我们知道昨晚你跟他在飞机上
We know you were on the flight with him last night.

365
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,323
坠机的那架
The one that crashed.

366
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,328
你们到底是谁？
Who are you again?

367
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,249
联邦调查局，你认识米勒先生
FBI. You do know Mr. Miller.

368
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,084
我不认识
No, I don't.

369
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,295
“威奇塔机场摄影机”


370
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:12,511
这个嘛 我们在过安检时聊了一下，可是…
Well, we chatted a little bit before security, but...

371
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:17,474
我懂，那登机复发生什么事？ 继续聊天？
I see. And once you were on the flight, what happened then? More chatting?

372
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,145
不，我…
No, I eh...

373
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,524
不算，我喝了一杯，然后…
No, not really, I had a drink, and...

374
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,735
然后就醉倒了
And I was out

375
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,779
他是谁？
Who is he?

376
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,075
直到一周前
Until a week ago

377
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,538
罗伊米勒都还是世界上 最受信任、最能干的探员
Roy Miller was the most trusted, incapable covered agent

378
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,458
一周前出了什么事？
What happened a week ago?

379
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,003
赫文斯小姐，这些事恕我无法奉告
Miss Havens, 

380
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,173
就说他承受巨大压力好了
Let's just say, stress caught up with him.

381
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,050
一开始是不信任同僚的指令
It started with the untrust of fellow agent command

382
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,971
之后变成与现实脱节
and it grew until a full break with reality

383
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:02,060
但他很有魅力
Well, he was very charming

384
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,897
不过只在我还清醒的时候啦
while I wasn't getting out

385
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,066
一下子很有魅力 一下子又嗜杀成性
Charming one moment, homocide the next

386
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,902
-我的问题很好笑？ -不是
-Is this funny to you? -No.

387
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,987
赫文斯小姐，他很危险又失控了
He's dangerous, Miss Havens, and out of control.

388
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:18,160
他说你会说他疯了
He said that you'd say he was crazy.

389
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,704
这表示你们交谈过，还正好谈到我
So, you did talk to him. And about me, no less.

390
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,457
不，我们谈论的不是你
No. No, not you, specifically.

391
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,334
那是谁？
About whom, then?

392
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,794
赛门费克？
Simon Feck?

393
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,714
我不知道那是谁
I don't know who that is.

394
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:36,637
事情愈描愈黑了 我想我可能该找个律师
Look, this is getting really twisted around, and I think I should probably call a lawyer.

395
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,731
抓到米勒前，我们会将你安置好
We're gonna take you to a secure location, Miss Havens, until Miller is contained.

396
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,149
一个安全的地方
Someplace safe.

397
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,403
-跟你一起？ -是，女士
-With you? -Yes, ma'am.

398
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,875
各位，能透露我们要去哪里吗？
You wanna tell me where we're going?

399
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,546
别担心，你很安全
-Fellas? -Don't worry, miss, you're safe.

400
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,381
什么？
Excuse me?

401
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,424
你跟我们在一起很安全
You're safe with us.

402
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,926
我想知道我们要去哪里
I wanna know where we're going.

403
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,512
只是个过渡期，直到情况稳定
Just a shortcut till the situation is stabilized.

404
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,139
我们会维护你的安全
We'll keep you safe.

405
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,724
你说过很多遍了
You said that already.

406
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,935
因为我是认真的
Because I meant it.

407
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,188
杰克森在干嘛？
What is Jackson doing?

408
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,487
枪手！枪手！回避！回避！ 高速公路上有枪手
Shooter! Shooter! Evade! Evade! Shooter on the freeway.

409
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:36,780
你背后有红点！
The dot's on your back!

410
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,994
快跟着我！
Follow me, now!

411
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,870
你疯了吗？我才不跟你跳！
Are you insane? I'm not going out that door!

412
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,090
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

413
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,758
别踩…
Get your foot off...

414
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,735
-我的天啊！ -茱恩！
-Oh, my God! -Hey, June!

415
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,029
-我看不到！ -你表现得很棒
-I can't see! -You are doing great.

416
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,489
-别挡住！ -开门
-I can't see! Get out of the way! -Open the door.

417
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,283
我无法把他的脚移开油门
-I can't get his foot off the gas. -Open the door, June.

418
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,286
开门，对了，衣服很漂亮喔
Open the door, June. That's a beautiful dress, by the way.

419
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,206
等一下
One second.

420
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,001
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

421
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,640
我完全知道你在说什么
I totally know what you're talking about. 

422
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,392
真无趣，我根本无法忍受， 一点也没办法
It's so boring, I can't even stand it. Totally.

423
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,644
谢谢
Thank you.

424
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,484
你是怎么做到的？
How did you do that?

425
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,157
-你在干嘛？ -不要慢下来
-What are you doing? -Don't slow down!

426
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,659
不行啊
I can't

427
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,753
你到底是谁？
Who are you?

428
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,014
-嗨，茱恩 -别挡住，我看不到！
-Hi, June. -Move out of the way, I can't see!

429
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,724
请打开车锁，茱恩
Please unlock the door, June.

430
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,604
解锁 那样我才能帮你
Unlock the door. That way, I can help you.

431
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,523
-我不行放手！ -你需要放手，茱恩
-I can't let go! -You need to let go, June.

432
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,827
-茱恩，开门！ -开了！
-June, door! -Got it!

433
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,098
靠边停！我的天啊！
Just pull over! Oh, my God!

434
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:23,363
过来…对，过来这里
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yup, come over here.

435
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,490
就是这里，蹲下，你表现很好
Right over here. Just stay down, you're doing good.

436
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,160
拿着…好极了
Here, hold this. Well, well, well.

437
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,661
看这些玩意
Check this out.

438
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,705
正点
Nice.

439
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,790
这些家伙有备而来
These guys are loaded for bear.

440
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,083
表现很好，茱恩
You're doing well, June.

441
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,253
开车技术一流，何况车上还有死人
Excellent driving. Over a dead guy, no less.

442
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,629
你是天生好手
You're a natural.

443
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,132
礼服很美
That's a beautiful dress.

444
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,009
是艾波儿的伴娘服吗？
Is that for April's wedding?

445
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,594
-周六？ -对
-Saturday? -Yeah.

446
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,345
-一定很棒 -是啊
-Yeah, that will be nice. -Yeah.

447
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,686
拜托…别再杀人了，好吗？
Please, stop shooting people, okay?

448
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,813
别再杀人了
Just stop shooting people.

449
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,939
我了解
I understand.

450
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,524
你吓坏了
You're in shock.

451
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,152
不如你待在这里
How about you stay here

452
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,530
我去跟隧道里的人哈拉一下，好吗？
while I go have a word with the guys in the tunnel.

453
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,740
好
-Okay? -Okay.

454
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,450
-好吗？ -好
-Okay? -Okay.

455
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,161
其实我是要去杀了他们，马上回来
Actually, I'm just gonna go shoot them. I'll be right back.

456
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,624
对了，你开车门的时间点…
By the way, your timing when you opened that door...

457
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,667
-好 -很到位
-Okay. ...was sublime.

458
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,628
你救了我们俩，希望你知道
You saved us, I hope you know that.

459
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,797
-你救了我们 -好
-You saved us. -Okay.

460
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,367
等一下
Hey, wait!

461
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,250
等等！
Wait! Wait! 

462
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,715
等等…！
Wait!

463
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,417
不妙
Oh, no.

464
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,544
不好意思，抱歉
Excuse me, sorry.

465
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,547
找到你了
There you are.

466
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,883
茱恩？
June?

467
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,427
茱恩？
June?

468
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,020
罗德尼？
Rodney?

469
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,772
他在健身房，在那边
He's in the gym. Over there.

470
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,108
-嗨！ -嗨！
-Hey! -Hey!

471
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,777
你来这里干嘛？
What are you doing here?

472
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,740
各位，跟茱恩打招呼，衣服真漂亮
Whoa! That's a... Hey, guys, say hello to June. That's a dress.

473
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,866
谢了
Thanks.

474
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,618
-一切都还好吧？ -还好
-Everything all right? -Yeah.

475
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,620
不，其实…
No, it's...

476
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,289
有点复杂
It's complicated.

477
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,791
说真的，我有同感
You know what? I've been feeling the same way.

478
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,418
想谈谈吗？
You wanna talk?

479
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,128
或许吃个派？
Maybe over some pie?

480
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,965
我的重点是…
My point is...

481
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,093
我的重点是坠机事件令我想起…
My point is, that plane crash made me think

482
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,261
我们的分手
about our break-up.

483
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,639
我突然就开窍了！
You know, this bulb went off, bing!

484
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,223
罗德尼，你怎么可以放弃？
"Rodney, why are you giving up? 

485
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,308
你太消极了
You're being passive."

486
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,268
因为她不想结婚就怨恨她
"Getting back at her because she didn't want the ring."

487
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,312
就算茱恩现在不想订婚
"So June didn't want to be engaged right now,

488
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,147
让你老妈不安，又怎样！
"and that freaks your mom out. Big deal!

489
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,691
那你们的共同计划呢？
"What about all the things you and June wanted to do together, huh?"

490
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,109
那些清单上的事？
Our list, you know?

491
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,654
比如跟我弟和希拉 坐他们的新拖车去佛蒙特州露营
Like camping in Vermont with my brother and Sheila in their new Winnie.

492
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,656
看蓝人团体表演，战场模拟体验
Tickets to Blue Man Group, the battlegrounds tour.

493
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,824
我想谈谈坠机的事
I wanna talk about the plane crash. Okay?

494
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,662
当然，什么事？
Sure, what about it?

495
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,121
我在那上面
I was on it. I mean, in it.

496
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,666
我是说在飞机里
I mean, I was in it.

497
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,209
所以坠机时你在场？
So you were in the plane crash?

498
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,336
我本来不应该在飞机里的 但还是搭上了
I wasn't supposed to be on that plane, but I was on it,

499
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:11,216
然后有个男人…某种特务
and there was this guy who was some sort of secret agent or something, and he...

500
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,386
他杀掉机上每个人
He killed everybody on board.

501
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,639
然后他把飞机降落
And then he landed the plane. 

502
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,807
接下来
Next thing you know,

503
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,225
我在我房间里醒来
I wake up, I'm in my room. 

504
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,601
我不知道我怎么回去的
I have no idea how I got there.

505
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:22,686
他一定对我下药
He must've drugged me or something. 

506
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,229
然后我去试穿伴娘服
Then I go to April's fitting,

507
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,064
因为我得穿这么瞎的衣服
because I have to wear this ridiculous dress.

508
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,441
之后其他探员来绑架我
These other guys, these other agents come, they snatch me up.

509
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,567
转眼间
Next thing you know, 

510
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,277
我就陷入州际公路的飞车追逐
I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the l-93.

511
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,487
你干嘛碰我的手？
Why are you touching my hand?

512
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,155
因为我想帮你
Because I'm here for you.

513
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,533
-老天，你压力太大了！ -没错！
-Jeez, you are so stressed out! -Well, yeah!

514
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,201
-我懂 -真的？
-And I get it. -Really?

515
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,703
我完全了解
I completely understand. I mean...

516
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,038
-天啊，茱恩 -我了
-Wow, June. -I know.

517
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,165
你小妹要结婚了
-Your little sister's getting married... -It's like...

518
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,542
你备感压力
...and that is stressful.

519
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,545
你在说什么？你没听进我的话
What are you talking about, Rodney? You didn't even listen to what I was talking about.

520
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,631
我有，换作是我可能也半斤八两
No, I did. Look, I would probably be the same way in that situation.

521
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,383
我能怎么帮忙？搭场地？
What can I do to help? Setting up? 

522
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,467
我能找人来…
We can bring the guys over...

523
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,845
不…
No, no, no. Okay.

524
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,221
要命
Oh, Christ.

525
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,391
嗨，茱恩，听着
Hi, June. Look, I...

526
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,393
抱歉打断你们
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting anything, but...

527
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,729
我是罗伊米勒
I'm Roy Miller.

528
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,772
罗德尼布里斯
Rodney Burris.

529
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,275
罗德尼，你好
Rodney, hi. How are you?

530
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,694
我们没时间了
We're running out of time, 

531
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,738
或许我表达得不够清楚
and maybe I didn't make it clear enough,

532
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,408
但我们得暂时一起行动 因为我们的…
but we're gonna have to stick together for a little bit, because of our...

533
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,952
我们的…情况
You know, our situation.

534
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,456
提醒你一下，罗德尼是消防员
In case you didn't notice, Rodney is a fireman, okay?

535
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,959
他十分擅长处理任何意外情况
So he's perfectly capable of handling any situation that comes up.

536
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,794
感激不尽，你可以走了
Thank you very much, you can leave us alone.

537
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,254
我毫不怀疑
I have no doubt.

538
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:35,008
从小我就非常崇拜消防员
Ever since I was a little kid, I have great respect for firemen.

539
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,176
感恩
-I appreciate it. -Fact of the matter is,

540
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,094
事实上我觉得你们薪水太低
I don't think you guys get paid enough.

541
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,220
说得好
Yeah, we don't.

542
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,346
你在第10分队
You're in Engine 10.

543
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,223
对，第10分队
Yeah, Engine 10.

544
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,267
你考过中尉测验吗？
Yeah. Have you taken your lieutenant's exam yet?

545
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,393
我正在准备
I'm working on it.

546
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,270
是吗？顺利吗？
Yeah? How's that going?

547
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,772
很难考
It's a bitch.

548
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,274
你有去过那个叫什么厅的？
Did you ever do a tour in that hall, what is it?

549
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,234
古鲁夫厅，非常繁忙的地方
Grove Hall, that's where the action is. 

550
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,903
但也升得很快
It's the fastest way up the ladder.

551
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,113
-罗德尼！ -那里是火焰殿堂！
-Rodney! -House of Flames!

552
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,949
我经常想我应该…
I often thought I...

553
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,579
应该成为消防员
I should have been a fireman.

554
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,249
罗德尼，我讲的就是他
Rodney, this is the guy.

555
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,668
什么？
What?

556
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,378
就是这家伙
This is the guy.

557
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,172
什么，就是这家伙吗？
What? "This is the guy"?

558
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,674
抱歉，你是谁？
I'm sorry, who are you?

559
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,303
我就是那家伙？
I'm the guy?

560
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,014
-我就是那家伙 -就是这家伙
-I'm the guy. This is the guy. -This is the guy.

561
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,766
-就是这家伙 -我就是那家伙
-This is the guy. -I'm a guy.

562
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,476
-就是我没错 -就是你没错
-I'm the guy. -You are a guy.

563
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,145
-就是我 -就是他！
-I'm a guy. -He's the guy! He's the guy!

564
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,481
罗德尼，不管发生什么事
-Rodney, whatever happens... -God.

565
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,192
-为了你自身安全 -罗德尼，不管发生什么事
-Please, for your own safety... -Rodney, whatever happens,

566
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,777
请待在座位上
-you should know... ...please stay in the booth.

567
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,612
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

568
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,073
等等！
Wait!

569
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,991
所有人趴下
Everybody! Everybody get down.

570
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,661
趴下…！所有人趴下
Get down, down, down! Everybody down.

571
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,664
罗德尼趴下，否则我会轰掉她的头
Rodney, get down, or I will blow her head off.

572
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,165
我会轰掉她的头
I'll blow her head off.

573
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,543
我是怎么说的？
What did I say?

574
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,877
罗德尼，我怎么说的？
Rodney, what did I say?

575
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,712
-冷静，老兄 -回答我！
-Just calm down, buddy. -Answer!

576
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,801
抱歉，我以为你要动手
Sorry, I thought you were making a move.

577
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,012
抱歉，没事，我以为他要动手
Sorry. It's all right, I thought he was making a move.

578
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,682
做一些派给大家吃
Making a little pie. Pies for everybody. Everybody.

579
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,143
人人有份，但不加冰淇淋
Everybody gets pies, okay? No ice-cream, à la mode.

580
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,311
吃冰会腿软，问林肯就知道
Weakens the legs, people. Lincoln knew it. 

581
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,521
他就是腿软被干掉
It's why they got to him.

582
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,273
谁都不准跟着我们
No one follows us, 

583
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,650
否则我会自杀再干掉她
or I kill myself and then her.

584
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:24,868
请上车
Get in the car. Please.

585
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:25,994
不要
No.

586
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,203
小心头
Watch your head.

587
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,082
我们在哈里斯街
We're at 560 Harris. 

588
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,500
他们开蓝色富豪车
They're getting into a blue Volvo.

589
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,043
罗德尼！罗德尼！
Rodney! Rodney!

590
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,253
罗德尼？
Rodney?

591
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,845
我的天啊！罗德尼！
Oh, my God! Rodney!

592
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,389
别怕，看着我
It's okay. Look at me.

593
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,558
-看着我，别怕 -该死！
-Okay. Look at me, it's okay. -Shit!

594
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,101
子弹直接穿过
I shot you through and through. 

595
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,729
骨头、股动脉都没事
No bone, nowhere near the femoral artery, okay? All right?

596
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,231
这比挤进古鲁夫厅有效，赞啦
This is gonna be better for you than Grove Hall. It's all good.

597
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,942
好吗？你没事吧？
Okay? You good?

598
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,235
-没事？ -没事
-Good? -Good.

599
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,737
没事？
Good?

600
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,968
那间餐厅有四台保全摄影机
There were four security cameras in that restaurant, June.

601
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,970
证据显示你是我的人质
Now there is proof you're my hostage.

602
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,556
你不会被怀疑是歹徒
So we've cleared your name, with the locals, at least.

603
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,643
这是开始，之后会渐入佳境
You know? It's a start. Something to build on.

604
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,603
你对罗德尼开枪！
You shot Rodney!

605
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,896
没错
Yeah, I did.

606
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,482
但我有叫他待在座位上
But I asked him to stay in the booth.

607
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,776
你对罗德尼开枪！
You shot Rodney!

608
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,945
这可能是他遇过最好康的事
It might be the best thing that ever happened to him.

609
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,948
最好是，人一生都该挨个几枪！
Yeah, right, because we all should get shot every now and then!

610
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,616
罗德尼…
Rodney... 

611
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,284
罗德尼是好人，茱恩
Rodney is a good guy, June.

612
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,787
但不太适合你
But not really right for you.

613
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,748
纯粹个人想法，不过他是好人
I mean, you know, in my opinion. But a good guy.

614
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,917
挨子弹会让他变英雄
Took a bullet, he's gonna be a hero. 

615
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,168
可能会升职
Probably get a promotion.

616
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,586
停车
-Stop the car. Stop the car. -What?

617
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,506
停车，停车，快停车！
Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car. Just stop the car!

618
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,800
茱恩，我了解你不想淌这浑水
June, I understand you want off the carousel.

619
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,301
没错，我不想淌这浑水
I do, I wanna get off the carousel. Please, Roy.

620
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,971
罗伊，拜托停车，马上！
Can you stop the car, please? Right now!

621
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,181
我不是那种小心眼的人
I'm not one of those "I told you so" kind of guys,

622
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,976
但我有警告过你别上飞机
but I did warn you to stay off the plane last night.

623
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,186
什么时候？
When?

624
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,648
当我说“有时事出必有因”
Well, when I said, "Sometimes things happen for a reason."

625
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,193
那是什么鬼警告
That's not a warning. 

626
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,153
那不算警告，罗伊！
That's not a warning, Roy!

627
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,615
那跟汽车上的贴纸一样没用
That's like a needlepoint expression or a bumper sticker.

628
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:32,036
下次你该说… 茱恩，上飞机你就死定了！
Next time, try, "June, if you get on this plane, you will fucking die!"

629
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,207
之前那些人可能真的要保护我
You know, Roy, maybe they meant it when they said that I would be safe.

630
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,334
你当真？
You really mean that, June?

631
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,502
对！
Yeah!

632
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,006
你跟他们在一起时感到安全？
Did you feel safe with them?

633
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,841
比现在安全！
Safer than I do now!

634
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:48,344
好，好吧
Okay, okay. All right.

635
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,704
你最好明白
Just so you understand,

636
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:18,708
不跟我，你的寿命大概这样
right now, out there, on your own, your life expectancy is like here.

637
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,252
跟着我，在这里，不跟我，在这里
With me, it's here. Without me, here.

638
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,089
跟着我，不跟我，跟着我，不跟我
With me, without me. With me, without me.

639
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,883
所以…
So...

640
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,511
我不建议你回家，但由你决定
I wouldn't advise going home. But, you know, it's up to you.

641
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,014
现在我需要另一台车，走吧
So right now I need another car, keep moving.

642
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,892
有个正有生命危险的人在等我
Someone else is depending on me. Someone whose life is in danger.

643
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,395
他信任我，我多浪费一秒保护你
Someone who trusts me. Every second I waste chasing you,

644
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,231
都是在让他失望
I'm letting him down.

645
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,102
“移动，警告”


646
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:26,192
“艾玛波拉路5826号”


647
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:29,529
罗德尼
Rodney, 

648
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,365
你怎么这么勇敢？
why did you make this brave call to leap into action?

649
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,533
我没有想太多
Well, I didn't think.

650
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,119
大多数人当下都会这么做的
I just did what any man would do in that situation, you know?

651
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,912
我就跟着冲出去了
-I leapt into action. -Thanks.

652
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,455
如你所说，或许是多年训练的反应
Like you said, it's really the job.

653
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,957
你该引以为傲
You should be so proud.

654
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,125
-谢了 -做得好
-Thanks. -Good job.

655
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,919
这只是小伤，像被蜜蜂螫到
It really didn't even hurt. It was kind of like a bee sting.

656
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,295
好个勇敢的消防队员
What a brave firefighter.

657
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,464
医生说罗德尼会没事
The doctors tell me Rodney is going to be okay, 

658
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,258
只是皮肉之伤
just a flesh wound.

659
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,052
正港的波士顿英雄
A true blue Boston hero. 

660
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,720
回到棚内主播，丹
Back to you, Don.

661
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,404
就是这玩意
This is what it's all about.

662
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,407
大家都要抢的东西
That, right there, is what everybody wants.

663
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,411
汉堡王玩具？
A Burger King toy?

664
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,664
把它打开
Open it up.

665
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,799
热热的，是什么？
It's warm. What is it?

666
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,968
电池
A battery.

667
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,678
电池？
A battery?

668
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,014
它的代号是赛佛
It's code-named Zephyr. 

669
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,474
这可不是一般的金顶电池
Not your average Duracell.

670
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,477
高能量输出
It's high output. 

671
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,936
永远不会耗尽
Never runs out.

672
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,438
“永远”是什么意思？
What do you mean, "never"?

673
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,814
那个小玩意
That little thing there 

674
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,610
是自太阳后第一个永久能量来源
is the first perpetual energy source since the sun.

675
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,614
是说手电筒永远不用换电池？
So, what, your flashlight never runs out of juice?

676
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,200
它可提供的电力远超过手电筒所需
It can power a lot more than a flashlight, June.

677
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,534
真的？
Really? 

678
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,702
有多大？
How much more?

679
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:02,705
可供应一个城镇的用电
Small city.

680
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,373
或是大型潜艇
Large submarine.

681
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,793
这是重大成就
It's big.

682
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,213
发明它的人
The guy who invented it

683
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,174
高中才刚毕业
is barely out of high school.

684
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,718
赛门费克
Simon Feck.

685
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,887
我跟另外一名探员被指派…
I was assigned with another agent to 

686
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,889
在威奇塔实验室保护他
watch him at a facility, a lab in Wichita.

687
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,058
另一名探员
And the other guy, the agent, 

688
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,227
今早来找你的那个人
is the guy who picked you up this morning.

689
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,314
费兹杰罗
Fitzgerald.

690
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,650
几周前，我发现
A couple of weeks ago, I found out 

691
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,569
他打算卖掉这个电池
he was going to sell the battery

692
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,029
并杀掉赛门
and kill Simon.

693
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,033
所以我带走赛门
So I got Simon out of there,

694
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,493
安置他在某个安全地方
put him someplace safe 

695
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,662
然后去取回电池
and went back for the battery.

696
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,247
可是费兹…
And Fitz 

697
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,706
设计我
set me up. 

698
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,543
让大家以为我是叛徒
Made it look like I went rogue.

699
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,924
那时我正好撞见你
That's when I met you.

700
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,939
下一步呢？有什么计划？
So, what's next? I mean, what's the plan?

701
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,108
我想我们稍微休息
I think we get some rest,

702
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,859
去接赛门
pick up Simon, 

703
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,279
然后送你回去参加你妹的婚礼
and get you back for your sister's wedding.

704
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,701
我是这一行的佼佼者
I'm pretty good at what I do, June.

705
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,619
今晚
And tonight,

706
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,079
我们很安全
we're safe.

707
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,623
以童子军的名誉保证
Scout's honor.

708
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,960
安全无虞？
Safe and secure?

709
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,595
晚安，罗伊
Good night, Roy.

710
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,559
你真的当过童子军？
Were you really a Boy Scout?

711
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,896
鹰级童子军
Eagle Scout.

712
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,109
我是幼年女童军
I was a Brownie.

713
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:56,652
酷喔
That's cool.

714
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,908
晚安，罗伊
Good night, Roy.

715
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,839
“曼哈顿”


716
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,678
做一些派给大家吃，人人有份
Pies for everybody. Everybody. Everybody gets pies, okay?

717
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,597
但不加冰淇淋
No ice-cream...

718
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,018
你认为呢？她也有参一脚？
So, what do you think? Are we looking at another player?

719
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,938
她只是傀儡，我们都跟她谈过
We're looking at a pawn. I talked to her, so did he.

720
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,440
她有一间修车厂
She owns a garage, 

721
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,359
没护照，哪里都没去过
no passport, gone nowhere, been nowhere.

722
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,943
她是个无名小卒
She's a nobody.

723
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,864
你到现在还没抓到人
You've been two steps behind since this began, Fitz.

724
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,492
你确定你有办法搞定这事？
Are you sure someone is not taking you to school?

725
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,160
快点摆平它
Clean this shit up.

726
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,503
“布鲁克林，纽约”


727
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,307
这里是安全藏身处？
This is a safe-house?

728
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,227
赛门！
Simon!

729
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,403
赛门？
Simon?

730
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,075
跟紧我
Stay close.

731
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,162
赛门…
Hey, Simon,

732
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:34,041
没时间玩游戏了
this is no time to play.

733
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,597
这些是什么？
What is all this?

734
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,600
赛门，他的研究
Simon. It's what he does.

735
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,730
我来迟了，他走了
I'm late, and he's gone.

736
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,585
“罗伊”


737
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,362
“阿尔卑斯山脉”


738
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,530
赛门
Simon.

739
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,250
“火车”


740
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:11,347
奥地利制
"Made in Austria."

741
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,155
这些人是谁？费兹的人手？
Who are these people? Are they Fitzgerald's guys?

742
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,866
不，是其他人
No, it's other guys.

743
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,701
其他坏人？
Other bad guys?

744
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,161
更坏的家伙
Worse guys. 

745
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,288
拿着弹匣
Hold my mags.

746
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,374
更坏的家伙？
Worse guys?

747
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,292
现在我要你仔细听
Now, I need you to listen carefully. 

748
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,710
完全照我的话做
Do exactly as I say.

749
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,463
数到3，我会开火找掩护
On three, I'm gonna lay down cover,

750
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,674
然后我们跑到那里的架子
then we're gonna run to those shelves over there.

751
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,800
好
Okay.

752
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:48,884
-懂吗？ -懂
-Okay? -Yeah.

753
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,219
准备好了？1…
-You ready? -Yeah. -One...

754
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,560
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

755
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,936
抱歉
Sorry. 

756
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,229
我慌了
I panicked.

757
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:02,565
你想要数到几？
What number would you like?

758
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,149
3，3是个好数字
Let's just stick with three, it's good.

759
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,234
好
Okay. 

760
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,569
1…2…
One... Two...

761
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,903
3
Three.

762
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,333
这些人很狡滑
These guys are fancy. 

763
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,043
弹匣
Mags.

764
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,337
可能是安东尼奥昆塔那的人马
Could be Antonio Quintana's men. 

765
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,382
他是西班牙军火商
He's a Spanish arms dealer.

766
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,427
他也想要电池
He also wants the battery.

767
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,595
准备好了？
Ready?

768
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,597
-走吧 -好
-Let's move. -Okay.

769
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,100
茱恩，茱恩！
June. June!

770
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,605
我们要怎么逃离这里？
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

771
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,273
赛门人到底在哪里？
And where the hell is Simon?

772
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,900
我还不知道，但他留下讯息
I don't know yet, but he left a message.

773
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,401
讯息？
-A message? -Wait.

774
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,120
我要你在这里等
What I need you to do right now is wait here.

775
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,955
-什么？ -我去找逃生路线
-What? -Yeah. I'm gonna find us a way out.

776
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,957
-我不能在这里等！ -我马上回来
-I can't wait here! -I'll be right back.

777
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,125
等等！罗伊！
Wait! Roy!

778
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,960
拿着这个
Just take this.

779
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,974
罗伊？
Roy?

780
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,563
茱恩？
June?

781
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,900
茱恩！茱恩！茱恩！
June! June! June! June!

782
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,492
茱恩！
June!

783
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:37,743
拜托别鬼叫我名字了
Please stop saying my name.

784
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,912
你一直叫我名字我会抓狂
You keep saying my name, it's freaking me out.

785
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,166
好，我懂了
-Okay. I understand. -Okay.

786
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,670
-喝这个 -这是什么？
-Drink this. -What is it?

787
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,797
抗毒剂，他们会放出毒气
Brotine-zero. They're gonna smoke us with D-5.

788
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,090
好
Oh, yeah.

789
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,176
你的呢？
Where's yours?

790
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,765
可恶
Oh, shit.

791
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,016
-抱歉 -不
-I'm sorry. -Oh, no.

792
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,643
他们来了
They're coming.

793
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,370
茱恩…
June.

794
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,208
我知道情况看似不妙
I know this looks bad,

795
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,128
但我们几分钟内
but we'll be out of here

796
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:32,339
就会逃出这里
in a couple of minutes.

797
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,507
我会搞定
I got this.

798
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,556
我们得走了，茱恩
We gotta go, June. Here, 

799
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,057
我会帮你
I'll help you.

800
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,694
我们被击中了
We've been hit!

801
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,988
但没大碍
But it's okay!

802
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,574
我们度过这关就脱离困境了
We get through this, we're home free!

803
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,326
准备好…预备…跳！
Ready, set, go!

804
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,923
我们快到了
We're almost there.

805
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,554
你好，懒惰虫
Hey, there, sleepy head.

806
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,066
我昏迷多久了？
How long have I been out?

807
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,984
18小时
Eighteen hours.

808
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,738
我在哪里？
Where am I?

809
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,616
我的窝
My place.

810
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,452
我们在无讯号区
We're off-grid.

811
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,955
从没人能找到这里
No one's ever found me here.

812
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,748
可惜我们不能久待
Shame we can't stay longer.

813
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,416
我们得去找赛门
We got a rendezvous with Simon.

814
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,294
他没事，我解读了他的密码
He's fine. I figured out his code.

815
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,672
他是铁道迷
He's crazy about trains.

816
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,508
他用我给他的护照去奥地利
He used the passport I gave him and went to Austria.

817
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,844
你又对我下药了，罗伊
You drugged me again, Roy.

818
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,262
是啊
Yeah.

819
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,347
你不行这样
You can't do that.

820
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,518
你的抗压性不高
Well, you weren't coping well.

821
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,687
我不确定要是你醒着
I'm not sure, if you were awake, 

822
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,772
他们会不会放你一条生路
if they would've even let you live.

823
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,691
我穿着什么？
What am I wearing?

824
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,614
比基尼，我们在热带区
A bikini. We're in the tropics.

825
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,783
我怎么穿上的？
How did I get in the bikini?

826
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,707
茱恩，我曾受训在黑暗中
June, I've been trained to dismantle a bomb in the pitch black

827
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:16,295
只靠安全别针和薄荷糖拆炸弹
with nothing but a safety pin and a Junior Mint.

828
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:21,049
我想我能替你穿脱衣服却…
I think I can get you in and out of some clothes without

829
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,217
不瞄一眼
looking.

830
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,724
我不保证没瞄，可是…
I'm not saying that's what I did, but...

831
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:29,933
好吧
Okay. 

832
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,894
抱歉，反射动作
Sorry. Reflex.

833
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,645
我该受罚
I deserved that. 

834
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,397
再打我一次
Hit me again.

835
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,399
我不会阻止你

837
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,530
茱恩？
June?

838
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,534
茱恩！
June!

839
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,371
回纹针和薄荷糖
...paper clips and Junior Mints...

840
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,084
我不保证没瞄
"Not that I'm saying that's what I did."

841
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,422
该死！
Shit!

842
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,764
这是他的手机吗？
Is this his phone?

843
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:09,932
“移动，警告”


844
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,894
移动，警告
Movement alert.

845
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,354
“艾玛波拉路5826号”


846
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,064

847
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,691
5826号

848
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,445
那是1967年的庞帝克车款
That's a '67 Grand Prix.

849
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,122
我以为我们应该在无讯号区
I thought we were off the grid.

850
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,791
艾波儿
April.

851
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,709
艾波儿？
April?

852
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,420
艾波儿！我知道！我没事！
April! I know! No, I'm okay!

853
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,131

艾波儿，听到我吗？艾波儿！
April, can you hear me? April!

855
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,303
艾波儿，你能…

我懂，我没事！听着，艾波儿…
I know! No, I'm okay! Listen, April... April?

857
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,232
能听到我吗？
April, can you hear me? April!

858
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,317
米勒在干嘛？


859
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,069
那女的是谁？


860
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,153
我们不清楚，安东尼奥
We don't know, Antonio.

861
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:10,367
我们追踪她的电话到亚速尔群岛 我们掌握位置了
We traced her phone to the Azores. We're in range now.

862
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,996
在调查局前逮到他们
Get to them before the agency.

863

00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,464
午餐好了
Lunch is ready.

865
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,967
你一定很渴
You must be thirsty.

866
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:34,516
这是椰子汁，富有电解质
It's coconut. It's loaded with electrolytes.

867
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,312
冷静，好吗？
Just... Whoa. 

868
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,443
冷静
Okay?

869
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,862
可以吗？
Yeah?

870
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,488
好耶！
Yeah!

871
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,742
你有两把刷子呢
Hey. You got skills.

872
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,787
-我爸想生男孩 -是吗？
-My dad wanted boys. -Yeah?

873
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:57,414
放开我
Let me go.

874
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,708
你想走随时能走
You can get out anytime you want.

875
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,209
我教你
I'll show you.

876
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,254
魔术师的手势
Hands like Houdini.

877
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,506
手掌转向下
Turn your palms down,

878
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,550
连续动作
and all at once,

879
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:12,637
手甩向地面，屁股往后推
throw your hands to the ground and your hips back.

880
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,725
很好
Nice.

881
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,019
好样的
That was good.

882
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,245
你到底是谁？
Who are you?

883
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,165
讲真的
Really.

884
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,723
这怎么可能
I don't understand.

885
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,352
跟我来
Follow me.

886
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,286
我搞不懂，我没留下线索
I don't understand. I came in clean.

887
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,623
我的手机无法追踪
My phone is secure. It's secure. 

888
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,542
除非你打了电话
Unless you made a call.

889
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,503
-但你没打电话 -对，我没打
-And you didn't make a call. -No, I didn't make a call.

我接了电话
I took a call.

891
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:31,967
你接了电话？
You took a call?

892
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,718
通话时间很短
It was a quick one.

893
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,679
你…
You...

894
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:38,974
快点
Come on.

895
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:41,143
我以为我们在无讯号区
I thought we were off the grid,

896
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,644
-然后手机响了 -别紧张
-and then the phone rang. -It's okay.

897
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,312
是我妹，我得接电话
It was my sister and I had to take the call.

898
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,439
小心脚步
Watch your step.

899
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,482
-我不想让她担心 -保持专心
You know? I didn't want her to worry. 

900
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,320
不…
No, no, no...

901
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,489
我不行，我不行上去那玩意
I can't get into that. I just can't get into that thing.

902
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,116
我不敢上去
I can't get into that.

903
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,952
-茱恩 -罗伊…
-June. -Roy...

904
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,289
你还是弄昏我好了，什么药都好
Just, please, knock me out. Use broton-seven or whatever.

905
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,708
-别怕 -你抓着我脖子
-It's okay. -You're grabbing my neck.

906
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,460
你要我别对你下药
You asked me not to drug you.

907
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,253
好，很好
Okay, good.

908
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:22,225
魔术师的手势…
Hands like Houdini. Hands...

909
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,123
罗伊？
Roy?

910
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,502
“开普尔山，阿尔卑斯山脉”


911
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,716
-我感觉不到脸！ -时候到了
-I can't feel my face! -Okay, time.

912
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,593
好，赛门，我们得回去了
Okay, Simon...

913
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,429
罗伊，这东西的拉力…
Roy, the pull on this thing...

914
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,181
-我们说好10分钟 -这东西的牵引力
-We said 10 minutes. -The traction on this thing.

915
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,517
能拉动5万公吨！
It can pull up to 50,000 metric tons!

916
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,726
我懂了

917
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,146
这是液压传动柴油车！
It's a diesel hydraulic!

918
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,023
你不想看你的赛佛吗？
Don't you wanna see your Zephyr?

919
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,733
想
Yes.

920
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,291
请问一下
Excuse me.

921

现在吗？我们在奥地利
Right now, miss? We are in Austria.

924
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,672
奥地利
Austria, huh?

925
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,217
小姐，需要早餐吗？
Would you like some breakfast, miss?

926
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,261

928
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:45,058

933
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,569
“来电，不明号码”


934
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,948
统计上，搭火车的死亡率
You know, statistically, you're a lot more likely to die riding on a train

935
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,075
远高于任何其他种类交通工具
than any other form of transportation.

936
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,205
比坐飞机上高10.3倍
10.3 times more likely than dying on a plane.

937
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,208
赛门？
Simon?

938
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,378

942
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,969
好巧！
Oh!

943
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,721
你有找到他吗？有见到他吗？
Have you found him yet? Have you seen him?

944
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,806
还没
No, not yet.

945
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,391
你不接电话吗？
Don't you wanna answer that?

946
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,642
想
Yeah.

947
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,102
可是不行
But I can't.

948
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,687
我不该接
I'm not supposed to.

949
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,063
可能是罗伊
It might be Roy.

950
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,232
是啊，但他叫我别接电话
Yeah, but he told me not to answer the phone, 

951
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,443
因为信号会被追踪
because the signal can be tracked.

952
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,445
没错，当然了
That's right. Of course.

953
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,533
“待在房间，我跟赛门在一起”


954
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,289
罗伊有跟你说接下来的计划吗？
Did Roy happen to tell you about the plan here?

955
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,458
我们该在这里碰面或…
Are we supposed to meet him here, or...

956
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,002
你说那杯调酒叫什么？
What did you say that drink was?

957
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,504
-哈维… -是哈维撞墙
-A Harvey... -It's a Harvey Wallbanger.

958
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,465
帮我点一杯好吗？
Do you mind just ordering me one of those?

959
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,216
看起来很好喝
Because it looks great.

960
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,385
我马上回来，你在这里等一下
I'll just be right back. You just stay here for a second.

961
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,346
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

962
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,597
不太对劲
Something is wrong. 

963
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,016
电池愈来愈热了，罗伊
It's getting hotter, Roy.

964
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,726
她没接电话
She didn't answer her phone.

965
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,770
-我叫她别接 -我们刚到这里
-I told her not to. That's... -We just got here.

966
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,854
这是好消息
That's good news.

967
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,356
我相信她会出现的，罗伊
I'm sure she'll turn up. Roy...

968
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,815
我贴了纸条给她看
I left a note posted right there.

969
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,359
这可能会是个问题
We may have an issue here.

970
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,945
-温度… -她饿了…她饿了
-The temperature... -She's hungry... She's hungry.

971
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,448
愈来愈热了，我们需要冷却它
It's getting too hot. We need to cool it down.

972
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,492
对，她一定是去找东西吃
Yeah, she went to get something to eat.

973
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,369
很好，来吧，赛门
Good. Come on, Simon.

974
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,522
-需要服务吗？ -是
-May I help you? -Yeah.

975
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,731
我感觉有点晕车
I'm feeling a little bit train-sick.

976
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,274
能待在这里一下吗？
Is it okay if I hang out here for a while?

977
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,027
当然，我拿些水给你
Of course, I will get you some water.

978
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,114
请用
Here you go.

979
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,790
你杀了他
You killed him

980
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:15,500
不，是你杀的
No, you did

981
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:24,050
你不看大自然频道的吗？
Have you never watched the Nature Channel?

982
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,680
现在这样就是豹子抓到小鹿
See that's the moment,

983
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,683
小鹿跑了那么久
for so long

984
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:35,478
终于停步，躺下了
just stops and lies down

985
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:40,108
这一刻非常真诚，对吧？
that's a very honest moment, don't you see it?

986
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,789
电池在哪里？
Where is the battery?

987
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,264
抱歉，我想找冰块
I'm sorry, I'm looking for ice.

988
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,474
-罗伊 -班哈德
-Roy. -Bernhard.

989
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,558
米勒
Miller.

990
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,602
-真衰 -别担心
-Wrong room. -It's okay. It's okay.

991
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,104
-你认识他？ -对
-You know him? -Yeah.

992
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,273
他是白金级的杀手
He's an assassin, platinum grade. 

993
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,358
他来抓赛门的
He's come to collect Simon.

994
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,526
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

995
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:24,861
还有杀你
And to kill you.

996
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:25,987
那是赛门？
That's Simon?

997
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,198
对，茱恩、赛门，认识一下
-Yeah, June, Simon. Simon, June. -Hi.

998
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,037
老天
Jeez! 

999
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,622
没关系，我会搞定
I'm okay. I got this.

1000
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,049
赛门，让开
Simon, please move.

1001
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,982
你相当有种，小姐
You have quite some balls, Frǎulein.

1002
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,902
魔术师的手势
Hands like Houdini.

1003
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,662
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1004
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:21,125
但你想杀我
But you were trying to kill me.

1005
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,597
好恶心
That's disgusting.

1006
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,358
我的天，快死吧！
Oh, my God. Just die!

1007
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:49,696
该死
Oh, shit.

1008
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,826
我得送你们到安全地方
I got to get you guys someplace safe.

1009
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,250
“法医”


1010
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,087
-他们不在火车上 -是吗？
-They're not on the train. -Oh, really?

1011
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,922
上一站的监视器没有照到他们
Cameras at the last station show nothing.

1012
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:10,133
他们一定在半路下车了
They must have gotten off between stops.

1013
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,051
当地警方一无所获
Locals haven't found anything.

1014
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,959
老爱耍花招，罗伊
Always the classics, Roy.

1015
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,089
别动，我5分钟后回来
Stay here, I'll be back in 5

1016
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,041
费兹
Fitz

1017
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,379
罗伊
Roy

1018
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,547
感谢你见我
Thanks for meeting me

1019
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,884
感谢你离职
Thanks for the flying

1020
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,220
我从那个小圈子看到你时
You know, when I saw you through that little circle,

1021
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,055
觉得你在找出口
I saw a man looking for a way out.

1022
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:44,686
我不是说过去几天不够精彩
not telling the last few days haven't been an absolutly spectacular 

1023
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:48,064
但我想你该知道事情终会结柬
but I think you know it's all coming to an end

1024
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,777
我想你知道 你会害你那个女朋友死掉
I think you know you're gonna get your little lady killed

1025
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,995
在我看来，你有几个选择
The way I see it, you have some options

1026
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,999
出卖赛门，卖电池
You could sell Simon, you could sell the battery

1027
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:09,585
你出卖他们，就可以脱身


1028
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,462
或是你去自首
Or you could turn yourself in

1029
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:13,673
是可以
Could

1030
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,968
那是对你关怀的人 最安全的选择
That's the safest option for the people you seemed to cared so much about.

1031
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:20,138
天才男孩不会有事 没人会看到他受伤
The boy genius would be fine. No one wants to see him hurt

1032
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,264
那女的呢？
And the girl?

1033
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,057
她会回家 她所经历的那场冒险
She goes home, having left her adventure 

1034
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:26,352
没人会相信
that no one and her little world will ever believe

1035
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,120
喂
Yes

1036
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,500
不，我们刚到
No, we just got in.

1037
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:54,047
我们现在不是在说话了？ 不，我了解
Well, we're talking now. No, I understand.

1038
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,299
也很高兴听到你的声音，娜欧蜜
Well, it's good to hear your voice, too, Naomi.

1039
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,427
我跟你在可普斯碰头 你尽快赶到那里
I'll meet you at the caprice. As soon as you can be there.

1040
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,480
这个城市很美吧？
It's a beautiful city, huh?

1041
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,398
是啊
Yeah.

1042
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,777
没见过这种美景
Never seen anything quite like it.

1043
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,576
我也一样
Neither have I.

1044
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,539
我得出去一下
I got to go out for a bit.

1045
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,709
好
Okay.

1046
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:35,046
我想叫客房服务
I was thinking about ordering some room service.

1047
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:40,092
我想或许我们能共进晚餐
And I thought maybe we could have dinner or something.

1048
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,094
听起来很棒
That sounds great.

1049
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,305
9点好吗？
9:00?

1050
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,683
没问题
9:00 sounds great.

1051
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,146
茱恩？
June?

1052
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:58,402
帮个忙待在房里好吗？安全起见
Could you do me a favor and just stick around here? It's better.

1053
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,323
当然，我能去哪里？
Oh, yeah, of course. Where else am I gonna go?

1054
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,867
待会见
See you in a bit.

1055
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:09,580
他们不会伤害你
They're not gonna hurt you. 

1056
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,958
你太有价值了
You're too valuable to them.

1057
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,918
深呼吸，听你的音乐
Now, just breathe, listen to your music.

1058
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:15,962
拿去，事实上我替你弄到这个
Here, as a matter of fact, I got that for you.

1059
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,338
“霍尔与欧兹乐团”


1060
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,756
我知道你喜欢他们
I know you like them.

1061
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,049
谢了
Cool, thanks.

1062
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,718
听着，随你点客房服务
Listen, order as much room service as you like, 

1063
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,804
但别离开房间
but don't leave the room.

1064
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:26,222
好
Okay.

1065
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,100
我晚点需要跟你谈赛佛的事
We need to talk about the Zephyr later.

1066
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,268
当然
And we will.

1067
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:59,023
发生了那些事，我不确定你还会来
considering what's happened

1068
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,445
生活满有意思的，不是吗？
Life could be funny, isn't it?

1069
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,490
我们所做的选择


1070
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,327
爱人和朋友
Lovers and friends

1071
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,662
失去和找到
Lost and found

1072
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,873
你看起来不太一样
You seem different.

1073
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,041
是吗？
Do I?

1074
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,254
你的同伴是谁？
So, who's your companion?

1075
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,424
她很漂亮，那个金发妞
She's beautiful. The blonde.

1076
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,677
她似乎很能干
She seems capable.

1077
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,137
我刚认识她
I just met her.

1078
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,057
她不重要
She's a nobody.

1079
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,978
我跟她只是萍水相逢
Just someone I picked up along the way.

1080
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,230
太可惜了
That's a shame.

1081
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:44,318
这话题很无趣 我们到底要不要交易？
This is getting boring. Are we gonna do a deal or not?

1082
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,156
别用这口气跟我说话
Don't speak to me like that.

1083
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,203
我想用什么口气是我的事，东尼
I will speak to you any way I please, Tony.

1084
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,038
你运气好才见得到我
We both know you're lucky I'm here.

1085
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,627
电池在我手上，我很忙
I have the battery. I'm on a schedule.

1086
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,505
世上不缺坏人，大把人要出价
The world is full of bad guys and people are calling.

1087
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,303
我了解
I understand.

1088
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,348
你的开价？
What's your price?

1089
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:17,810
我心中有个数字
I have a figure in mind.

1090
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,854
你们觉得值多少？
What's it worth to you?

1091
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:23,190
罗伊，你不爽你的岛被毁？
Are you angry about your island, Roy?

1092
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,609
时间不多了，东尼
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony.

1093
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:40,791
我是伊莎贝拉乔治
I'm Isabel George,

1094
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,877
中情局的反间谍部门主管
Director of Counter Espionage at the CIA.

1095
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,463
你当然是
I'm sure you are.

1096
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,091
原谅我，我…
Forgive me, I just...

1097
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,512
我不知道还有什么可以相信
I just don't know exactly what to believe.

1098
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,059
这不难理解，过去5天
Well, that's understandable, considering that the last five days

1099
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:02,354
你不断被一名局里叛离的探员
you've been fed a steady diet of misinformation and fantasy

1100
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,816
灌输错误情报和幻想
by an agent of ours who's recently gone rogue.

1101
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:09,779
他说费兹杰罗才是想偷电池的人
Well, he said that Fitzgerald was the one that wanted to steal the battery.

1102
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,530
我们来检视事实吧
Well, let's examine the facts.

1103
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:14,366
米勒告诉你他在保护赛佛…
Miller told you that he was protecting the Zephyr 

1104
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,368
被不肖人士滥用
from people wanting to misuse it.

1105
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:19,747
如今他却想卖给一名国际军火商
But now he's trying to sell it to an international arms dealer.

1106
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,041
安东尼奥昆塔那
Antonio Quintana.

1107
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,877
欧洲最大的武器制造商之一
One of Europe's leading weapons manufacturers.

1108
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,962
扪心自问，赫文斯小姐
Ask yourself, Miss Havens,

1109
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:33,344
罗伊米勒有哪句话是实话？
has Roy Miller said anything to you that's proven to be true?

1110
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,640
-不好意思 -不，我才抱歉
-God, excuse me. -No, I'm sorry.

1111
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,397
我在看手机，我最讨厌别人这么做
Sorry, I was looking at my phone. I hate it when people do that.

1112
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,110
我的天啊，真抱歉
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1113
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:53,030
撞上瘾了
This is getting to be a habit.

1114
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,573
是啊
Yeah, it is.

1115
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,661
他利用你挟带电池通过安检
He used you as a mule to carry the battery through security, 

1116
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,037
赫文斯小姐
Miss Havens.

1117
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,040
他在玩弄你
He's been playing you.

1118
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,210
他是间谍，专门以骗人为业
He's a spy, that's what he does. He lies for a living.

1119
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:07,711
利用爱意、同情…
Any love, empathy, 

1120
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:09,588
都是他被训练的项目
we train that right out of them.

1121
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,257
你有何遐想？
What did you imagine?

1122
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:14,635
你们两人住在一起，养只狗
The two of you would move into a condo together, get a dog?

1123
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:18,305
你不可能跟他生活，那是幻想
You can't have a life with him. That's fantasy.

1124
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,182
不过你能恢复原本生活
But you can have yours back.

1125
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,851
她离开8分钟了
She's been gone eight minutes.

1126
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:24,979
我们需要你在米勒之前回到饭店
We need you to get back to the hotel before Miller.

1127
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:29,275
我该怎么做？
What am I supposed to do?

1128
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:30,526
这样吧
All right, then.

1129
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,947
这只笔是发送器
This pen is a transmitter.

1130
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,616
一旦你确认米勒没藏着赛佛
Once you have confirmation that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr,

1131
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:41,537
在附近某处或他身上
that it's somewhere nearby, or on his person,

1132
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:45,165
按下顶端的按钮通知我们
you can confirm this by simply clicking the top button.

1133
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,719
抱歉，我晚了
I'm sorry I'm late.

1134
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,513
一切顺利吧
Everything go okay?

1135
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:03,976
还不错
Well enough.

1136
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,648
电池愈来愈热了
It's getting hotter.

1137
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,453
所以你谈好价钱了？
So, did you get your price?

1138
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,834
我今晚跟踪你
I followed you tonight.

1139
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,215
你无话可说？
You have nothing to say?

1140
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,844
敬威奇塔
Here's to Wichita

1141
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,848
我们第一次…
where we first...

1142
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:46,435
撞出火花的地方
Bumped into each other.

1143
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,106
你觉得那是命运吗？
Do you think that was fate, Roy?

1144
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,694
我不相信命运
I don't believe in fate.

1145
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,364
但我相信运气
But I believe in luck.

1146
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,660
我不知道该相信什么
I don't know what to believe.

1147
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:18,425
没想到我会这么心痛
That hurt more than I thought it would.

1148
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,515
我要回家了
I'm going home.

1149
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:38,821
他们承诺只要你自首，就会保护你
They promised that if you turned yourself in, they'd protect you.

1150
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:43,283
我欣赏你的乐观
I love your optimism.

1151
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:45,327
保持下去
Never lose it.

1152
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,211
带她出去
Get her out of here.

1153
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,479
他不在这里
He's not here, sir.

1154
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,399
他们有说会送你回家吗？
Did they tell you you're going home?

1155
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,901
你知道太多内幕了，茱恩！
You've seen the inside of the honeycomb, June!

1156
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,820
你不能回家
You can't go home.

1157
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,780
嫌犯在屋顶上
The suspect is on the roof.

1158
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,202
该死
Oh, shit.

01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,765
乔治小姐！
Director George!

1160
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,558
带她上车
Get her in the car.

1161
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,735
他逃往河边
He's heading toward the river.

1162
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,918
别开枪！电池在他身上！
Stand down! He has the battery!

1163
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,554
嘿！停止！
Hey! Hey! Hold it!

1164
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,763
停火！
Hold your fire!

1165
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,056
别开枪！
Stand down!

1166
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,224
电池在他身上！
He has the battery!

1167
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,786
那小子在我们手上吗？
Did you secure the kid?

1168
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,621
对
Yeah.

1169
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:44,965
有发现罗伊吗？
Did they find Roy?

1170
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,093
我们会找出尸体，一定要
We'll find the body. We have to.

1171
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,345
他带着赛佛沉入河底
He went down with the Zephyr.

1172

and I'd like to say special thanks to my sister June

1174
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,487

who many of you will recognize from "American's most wanted"

1175

Not just for helping me with tonight, but for helping me every night

1177
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:09,841
我知道这或许不是 你想要的生活
I know that it wasn't always the way you probably in vision

1178
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:15,472
你放弃了这许多 好让我过我想要的生活
You gave up so much that, I could have the life I wanted

1179
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,772
敬你
A toast

1180

1182

费兹？

1184
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:08,775
我想我们转错弯了 拉姆史坦应该往西
Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn. Ramstein is that way, west.

1185
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,610
我们现在是往南
I think we're going south.

1186
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,612
没错，你说对了

转告他我们重回正轨

我以为是结婚礼物

1195

原本是，不过…
It was, but,

1196
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,282
我想她不是那么想要我送她
I think I wanted her to want it more than she wanted it.

1197
01:23:58,492 --> 01:23:59,659
好吧
Okay.

Oh, yeah, like you didn't order pistons off the Internet.

1236
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:28,285

You don't know what you're typing into that computer, Frank.

1242

这究竟是怎么一回事？
Honey, what's this all about?

1243
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:56,688
抱歉，我以为…

01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:28,094
他救了两名同袍的性命
He saved the lives of two of his crewmen, and...

1250
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,139
他总是会照顾人
He just always took care of everyone.

1251
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,766
他是鹰级童子军
He was an Eagle Scout.

1252
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:36,269
这张是他游泳比赛领奖时拍的
This was taken the day he got that swimming badge.

1253
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:39,689
他可以游过萨纳比湖
He could swim clear across Lake Sunapee

1254
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,317
几乎不需要换气
with practically one breath.

1255
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,820
我实在…
I just...

1256
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,324
我太失礼了
I've been terribly rude.

1257
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,868
我是茱恩赫文斯
I'm June Havens.

1258
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,745
莫莉奈特
Molly Knight.

1259
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,664
我是茱恩赫文斯
This is June Havens, 

1260
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,832
我留言在自己的电话
and I'm leaving a message on my own machine

1261
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:00,043
给监听电话的人
for whoever is listening to this phone call.

1262
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,170
赛佛在我手上
I have the Zephyr.

1263
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,090
赛佛在我这里，我准备好谈交易
I have the Zephyr, and I'm ready to make a deal.

1264
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,677
我在28号公路旁
I'm sitting on Route 28, 

1265
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,429
就在新罕布夏州
right outside New Hampshire.

1266
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:13,390
如果你想要赛佛
And if you want the Zephyr,

1267
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:15,558
快点来拿吧
you better come and get it.

1268
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,220
嗨，大伙儿
Hey, fellas.

1269
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:58,893
所以…
So,

1270
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:01,771
你们想要赛佛吗？
you want the Zephyr?

1271
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:04,315
电池就在我这里
I got the Zephyr. It's right here.

1272
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,109
过来拿吧
Come and get it.

1273
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:12,073
“塞维尔，西班牙”


1274
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,627
拜托
Come on.

1275
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:26,463
让开！
Let's go!

1276
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,214
-好痛！ -欢迎来到西班牙
Welcome to Espana.

1277
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:42,520
今天是圣佛明奔牛节
Today is the festival of San Fermin.

1278
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,984
赫文斯小姐，你看过斗牛吗？
Have you ever seen a bullfight, Miss Havens?

1279
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:55,825
我是安东尼奥昆塔那
My name is Antonio Quintana.

1280
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,244
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

1281
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,457
我被下了什么药？
What did he give me?

1282
01:31:03,249 --> 01:31:06,085
是我公司正在研发的药
It's something we're developing at my company.

1283
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,504
新开发的吐真药
A new kind of truth serum.

1284
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:08,671
是吗？
Really?

1285
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:13,676
我有几个电池的问题要问你
I have a few questions for you about the battery,

1286
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:17,305
因为我们都知道你耍了我的人
since we both know what you gave to my men was a joke.

1287
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,186
我看你超不顺眼！
I don't like you very much.

1288
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,481
真心话！
The truth!

1289
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:29,901
很好
Good!

1290
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,490
我倒是很喜欢米勒
You know, I really like Miller, though.

1291
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,701
我在萨尔斯堡完全错怪他了
'Cause, you know, I was totally wrong about him in Salzburg.

1292
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:41,329
他要我听到那通电话好跟踪他
He wanted me to hear that phone call so that I would follow him.

1293
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,873
我供出他，他就能让我安全回家
I'd turn him in, and then he could get me home safely.

1294
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,458
他是为了保护我
He was trying to protect me.

1295
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:46,835
闭嘴
Shut up.

1296
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:48,044
很瞎的是…
It's crazy that 

1297
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:51,047
我在他身边感到坚强又能干
I could feel so powerful and capable around him...

1298
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:52,131
闭嘴
-Shut up.

1299
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:54,300
同时他也会照顾我
...and yet he takes care of me.

1300
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:55,510
闭嘴
Shut up! 

1301
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:57,387
电池在哪里？在哪里？
Where is the battery? Where is it?

1302
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,932
我敢说你从没替女生煎蛋卷
I bet you've never made a girl an omelet, 

1303
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:02,016
对吧，安东尼奥？
have you, Antonio?

1304
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,187
别惹火我，茱恩
Don't test me, June.

1305
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,690
或者及时送女生参加老妹的婚礼
Or got her to her sister's wedding on time.

1306
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,900
老实说这些都是小事
It's really the little things, honestly.

1307
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,151
不过却意义非凡
But they count so much.

1308
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:13,278
够了！
Enough!

1309
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:14,404
好！
Okay!

1310
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:15,572
米勒死了！
Miller is dead! 

1311
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,407
罗伊米勒死了，他出局了！
Roy Miller is dead, he's out.

1312
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:19,909
不对
No.

1313
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:23,538
他没死，他能憋气非常久
No, he's not. He can hold his breath for a really long time.

1314
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,040
他死了！
He is dead!

1315
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,829
我问你最后一遍
I'm not gonna ask you again. 

1316
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:07,832
要是你不告诉我实话
But if you don't tell me what I need to know,

1317
01:33:08,708 --> 01:33:09,751
你就死定了！
you're gonna die!

1318
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,252
我不知道电池在哪里
I don't know where the battery is.

1319
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,338
那你干嘛到处宣称你有？
Then why did you tell everyone you had it? Why?

1320
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:15,506
因为我想找到罗伊
Because I was trying to find Roy.

1321
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:21,846
安东尼奥，每当你这种坏人出现
Well, Antonio, whenever there's bad guys like you around, 

1322
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,264
罗伊就会在附近
Roy's not too far away.

1323
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:29,479
你死定了
You're gonna die.

1324
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:41,407
终于！
Finally!

1325
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,453
幸会，约翰
Nice to meet you, John.

1326
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,704
安东尼奥
Antonio.

1327
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:48,790
你没拿到电池太可惜了
Too bad you couldn't get the battery.

1328
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,835
那小子呢？
Where is the boy?

1329
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:58,174
你不会以为我会直接带来吧？
You didn't think I'd just bring the package, did you?

1330
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,137
带着钱跟着我到河边
Why don't you follow me down to the river and bring the money?

1331
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:04,681
好
Okay.

1332
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:41,509
这是盖草屋顶吗？我以前从没看过
Is this thatching in here? Because I've never seen anything like that before.

1333
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,803
波士顿有一些很旧的建筑
We have really old architecture in Boston, 

1334
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:45,221
但没有像这样的
but nothing like this.

1335
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,515
你真走运，因为这地方…
You're really lucky, because this place is...

1336
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:51,060
听我说，你真走运，这里真美
Let me tell you. You're really lucky, it's beautiful here.

1337
01:34:51,894 --> 01:34:53,312
现在我的思绪好清晰
My thoughts are so clear.

1338
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:57,567
这里靠军火收入还是家产盖的？
Is this all weapons money, or is this family money?

1339
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:00,278
花园！
Gardens! 

1340
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:01,988
他喜欢花园吗？
He likes gardens, huh?

1341
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:03,990
你们会园艺吗？
Do you guys ever do any gardening?

1342
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,993
可放松心情，棒极了
It's really relaxing. It's amazing how much you can just...

1343
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:10,121
这里真令人开心，瞧这些喇叭花
This really is a happy place. Look at these trumpet flowers. They...

1344
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,498
艾德华多，不必老是拉着我
Okay, Eduardo, you don't have to pull me around.

1345
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,751
干脆直接告诉我要去哪里
You can just tell me where you want me to go, okay?

1346
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:15,918
这边，金发妞
This way, blondie.

1347
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:17,962
看吧？我们终于在沟通了
See? Now we're communicating.

1348
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:21,632
你应该是要带我去安全无虞的地方
I bet you're taking me someplace safe and secure.

1349
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:23,843
特别地方，安东尼奥的特别处所
Someplace special. Antonio's special place.

1350
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,179
安东尼奥有特别处所？真好
Antonio has a special place? That's so nice.

1351
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:27,638
每个人都该有特别处所
Everyone should have a special place.

1352
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,024
路易斯？
Luis?

1353
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:40,151
艾德华多，有问题吗？
Is there a problem, Eduardo?

1354
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:48,159
-嗨，罗伊 -嗨，茱恩
-Hi, Roy. -Hi, June.

1355
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:49,327
你应该在家里
You're supposed to be home.

1356
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,621
-你应该挂了 -我能解释
-You're supposed to be dead. -I can explain.

1357
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,498
-不必解释 -我来这里救赛门
-You don't have to. -I came here to get Simon.

1358
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:55,458
我刚追踪到他
I just, you know, caught up with him.

1359
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:56,667
很好
That's cool.

1360
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:02,673
他叫做艾德华多
His name is Eduardo. Eduardo.

1361
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,303
我要你听好
I need you to listen, 

1362
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:08,471
因为你醒来时
because when you wake up,

1363
01:36:08,554 --> 01:36:10,389
你要打给你老板告诉他
you're gonna call your boss and you're gonna tell him

1364
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:11,891
罗伊米勒，就是我
that Roy Miller, that's me, 

1365
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,559
我拿到电池并跟这美眉逃了
has the battery and escaped with the girl.

1366
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,520
-你拿到电池了？ -对
-You have the battery? -Yeah.

1367
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:18,064
你告诉他下一个就是他
You tell him I'm coming for him.

1368
01:36:18,231 --> 01:36:20,066
-了没？ -了
-Yes. -Okay.

1369
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:22,443
我们走
Let's go.

1370
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,822
我担心赛门，我还没见到他
I'm worried about Simon. I haven't seen him.

1371
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:27,865
我的追踪系统断断续续
My tracker has been spotty.

1372
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,242
跟你生活好刺激！
Life with you is so exciting.

1373
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:30,701
你令我兴奋，米勒！
You excite me, Miller.

1374
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,036
我太晚到了
I took too long to get here.

1375
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:33,412
-7点钟方向 -什么？
-7:00. -What?

1376
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:34,747
7点钟方向
7:00.

1377
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:45,883
我想要炒饭
I think I feel like having sex.

1378
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:49,595
我们炒饭一定很过瘾
I think we'd have really great sex.

1379
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:52,223
他们有给你下药吗？
Did they give you something?

1380
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,434
你该多补充水分
You should hydrate.

1381
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:57,937
罗伊？
Roy?

1382
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:04,861
罗伊
Roy.

1383
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:11,367
罗伊？
Roy?

1384
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:12,618
茱恩
June.

1385
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:19,917
茱恩？
June?

1386
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,296
你见到我似乎没有很开心
You don't seem very happy to see me, Roy.

1387
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:27,133
什么？
What?

1388
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:28,968
你反应冷淡
Not really.

1389
01:37:48,487 --> 01:37:49,822
我很开心
I am happy.

1390
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,042
-这红点是我们？ -不，我们是黄点
-So the red dot is us? -No, we're yellow.

1391
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,251
红点是赛门
The red dot is Simon.

1392
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,713
快点！快点！
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1393
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:22,647
-该当空中飞人了 -空中飞人？
-Air time. -Air time?

1394
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,294
他说他的名字是罗伊米勒 他说电池在他那
He says his name is Roy Miller. He says he has the battery.

1395
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:52,551

1396

这边，跟着我！
This way. Follow me!

1399
01:39:14,407 --> 01:39:15,491
斗牛？
Bulls?

1400
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:37,722
-是费兹！ -我看到他了
-There's Fitz! -I see him.

1401
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,028
天啊
Oh my god!

1402
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:58,743
他们死了


1403
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,010
罗伊！罗伊！罗伊！
Roy, Roy, Roy

1404
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:31,400
上面
Up there

1405
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:43,954
-往哪里走？ -不知道，失去讯号了
-Which way? -I don't know. We lost the signal.

1406
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,345
-拿着枪 -好
-Take the guns. -Okay.

1407
01:41:42,888 --> 01:41:44,432
坐前面
Here.

1408
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:47,059
-接着呢？ -让他们吃子弹
-What next? -Let them have it.

1409
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,027
弹匣
Mags

1410
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:23,846
茱恩赫文斯，你真有两把刷子
June Havens, you've got skills.

1411
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:27,475
我们走！
Let's go!

1412
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:41,864
好
Go.

1413
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,348
下面见
See you down there.

1414
01:43:07,515 --> 01:43:09,350
-你确定？ -拼了
Are you sure?

1415
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,689
不好意思
Sorry.

1416
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:19,985
-起来 -好
-Get up. -Okay.

1417
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:30,955
别动，罗伊！
Freeze right there, Roy!

1418
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,081
嗨，赛门
Hey, Simon.

1419
01:43:32,164 --> 01:43:33,499
快跪下！
Get down on your knees, now!

1420
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:34,708
罗伊！
-Roy! -Now! Now!

1421
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:37,545
把枪丢入水中
Put them in the water. In the water.

1422
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,547
我只要这孩子，费兹
I just want the kid, Fitz.

1423
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:43,300
希望你带来我要的东西
Well, I hope you brought what I want, 

1424
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:45,135
否则我就得杀了他
otherwise I'm gonna have to kill him.

1425
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,346
我向你保证，我会下手
And I swear to you, I'll do it.

1426
01:43:47,513 --> 01:43:50,391
我相信你，在威奇塔就见识过
I believe you. Just like Wichita.

1427
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:52,726
-我了解 -好
-I understand. -Okay.

1428
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,228
我只是要拿电池
I'm just gonna get the battery.

1429
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:56,146
别给他，罗伊
-It's right here. -Don't give it to him, Roy.

1430
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,565
拜托别给他，不要
Please don't give it to him. No, no.

1431
01:43:57,731 --> 01:43:58,983
拜托别给他
Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him.

1432
01:44:00,192 --> 01:44:01,527
放在甲板上
Put it on the deck.

1433
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:03,821
罗伊…拜托别给他！
-Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him! -Easy, easy.

1434
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:05,030
赛门，别紧张
Simon, it's okay.

1435
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:06,240
罗伊，别给他！
Roy, don't give it to him!

1436
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:08,033
闭嘴！嗦！
-Shut it! Stop it! Shut it! -Roy!

1437
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:18,252
好吧，我会再作一个
Okay. Okay, I'll make another one.

1438
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:20,421
-你不懂 -赛门，别说了
-You don't understand. -Simon, don't talk.

1439
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:21,505
我会再作一个
I'll just make another one.

1440
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:23,591
再作一个？
Make another one?

1441
01:44:40,441 --> 01:44:42,234
我快死了吗？
Am I dying?

1442
01:44:43,193 --> 01:44:44,570
不，你只是昏倒了
No, you fainted.

1443
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:48,198
-对不起 -没关系
-I'm sorry. -No, that's okay.

1444
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:50,451
不，我一直试着告诉你
No, no. I've been trying to tell you...

1445
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:56,957
为什么很热？
Why is it hot?

1446
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,460
因为它充满能量
Because it's filled with power.

1447
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,296
那个电池…我搞砸了 它的状况正在恶化
The battery... I messed up. It's deteriorating.

1448
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:04,465
我知道，很不稳定
I know. It's unstable.

1449
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:17,311
你真天才，赛门
You're a smart guy, Simon. 

1450
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:19,647
你一定会想出解决之道
I know you'll figure it out.

1451
01:45:24,485 --> 01:45:25,527
我的眼镜，谢谢
Oh, my glasses. Thank you.

1452
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,155
罗伊…
Roy,

1453
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:30,115
你中枪了
you're shot.

1454
01:45:31,909 --> 01:45:33,243
找人帮忙
Get help.

1455
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:43,837
罗伊
Roy.

1456
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:50,844
你好美，茱恩赫文斯
You're beautiful, June Havens.

1457
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:06,026
保持清醒，罗伊，看着我
Stay with me. Roy, look at me.

1458
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,112
保持清醒
Stay with me.

1459
01:46:11,782 --> 01:46:15,119
我们来了，米勒，我们会救你…
We're here now, Miller. We got you. We got you.

1460
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,206
-充电到360 -茱恩…
-Charge at 360. -June.

1461
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,666
清空！
Clear!

1462
01:46:24,628 --> 01:46:27,047
“华府”


1463
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:48,694
这几周真是慌乱，米勒
It's been a spectacular couple of weeks, Miller.

1464
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,574
很高兴见到你，伊莎贝拉
It's good to see you, Isabel.

1465
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:57,578
嗨，各位
Hi, guys.

1466
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:00,748
你清理了门户，罗伊
You cleaned house, Roy.

1467
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,877
这点我得谢谢你
I have to thank you for that.

1468
01:47:06,044 --> 01:47:08,088
我信任错人了
I trusted the wrong man.

1469
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,048
这是难免的
It happens.

1470
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:16,764
赛门很开心，他有新的实验室
Simon's happy. He's got a new lab.

1471
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:18,932
茱恩呢？
Where is June?

1472
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:21,769
我送她回家了
I sent her home.

1473
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:26,106
她了解状况了
She gets it.

1474
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,611
她明白你俩的生活天差地别 她会继续过日子
She knows you two lead different lives and she's moving on.

1475
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,571
你也该这样
As should you.

1476
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:37,409
你早放弃了这一切羁绊
You gave up those things.

1477
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:41,371
抛开身分、家人、朋友 这是工作的一部分
You let go of who you were. Family, friends, that's the deal.

1478
01:47:42,623 --> 01:47:44,541
我们干嘛还谈这种事？
Why are we still talking about this?

1479
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:47,085
因为你是调查局的重要资产
Because the agency invested a lot in you.

1480
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:50,631
你唯有心无旁骛才有价值
And you're an asset only as long as you stay focused.

1481
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:00,641
你的气色很好
You look good.

1482
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,477
好好休息
Get some rest.

1483
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:07,981
我们明天得把你转到安全的地方 为了你的安全起见
We got to transfer you to a secure facility tomorrow. For your safety.

1484
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:38,262
护士，什么… 你给我什么？
Nurse? What... What did you give me?

1485
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,473
抗毒剂
Brotine-zero.

1486
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:55,487
别乱动，罗伊
Stay under there, Roy.

1487
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:58,031
你要装死
You're dead.

1488
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:02,703
请借过
Make way, please.

1489
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:04,913
去太平间
Going to the mortuary.

1490
01:49:10,419 --> 01:49:13,130
别担心，罗伊，我会搞定
Don't worry, Roy. I got this.

1491
01:49:14,172 --> 01:49:16,174
渡假时间到了
It's time for a vacation.

1492
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:27,811
乘风飞翔
Ride like the wind

1493
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:31,899
我要行经漫漫长路
And I've got

1494
01:49:33,650 --> 01:49:37,821
到达墨西哥边界
Such a long way to go To make it to the border of Mexico

1495
01:50:21,823 --> 01:50:23,784
你好，懒惰虫！
Hey, there, sleepy head.

1496
01:50:26,536 --> 01:50:27,871
今天是哪一天？
What day is it?

1497
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:30,165
有朝一日
Someday.

1498
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,710
有朝一日，罗伊
Someday, Roy.

1499
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,388
我穿着什么？
What am I wearing?

1500
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,058
海滩裤
A pair of shorts.

1501
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:51,895
我怎么穿上的？
How did I get into shorts?

1502
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:56,233
我曾受训徒手重组六速传动箱
Roy, I've been trained to rebuild a six-speed transmission

1503
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,069
只靠钳子和活动扳手
with nothing but a pair of pliers and a crescent wrench.

1504
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,906
我想我能替你穿海滩裤却不瞄一眼
I think I can get you into a pair of shorts without looking.

1505
01:51:04,658 --> 01:51:06,493
但我不保证没瞄
I'm not saying that's what I did.

1506
01:51:07,911 --> 01:51:09,579
你负责带路和播歌
You're both the navigator and the DJ.

1507
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,249
我们到合恩角有一段漫长的路
And we have a long way to go to Cape Horn.

1508
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:15,711
跟着我
With me

1509
01:51:15,877 --> 01:51:17,212
不跟我
without me. 

1510
01:51:17,379 --> 01:51:18,380
跟着我
With me,

1511
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:21,425
不跟我
without me.

1512
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:23,260
跟着你
With you.

1513
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:25,762
来点好听的音乐吧，DJ先生
Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ.

1514
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:27,931
是，女士
Yes, ma'am.

1515
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:35,105
“麻州”


1516
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:42,571
“合恩角”


1517
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:55,292
我的天啊，法兰克
Oh, my God, Frank.

1518
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,878
信封里怎么有去合恩角的机票？
What is this envelope with tickets to Cape Horn?

1519
01:51:57,961 --> 01:51:59,046
你在胡说什么？
What are you talking about?

1520
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:01,631
你订机票去南美？
Did you order tickets to South America?

1521
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:04,092
莫莉，我没订机票去任何地方
Molly, I didn't order tickets to anywhere.

1522
01:52:04,176 --> 01:52:06,720
你最好忘记自己在输入电脑什么
You don't know what you're typing on that computer, Frank.

1523
01:52:06,803 --> 01:52:08,680
-莫莉… -那我们一定又中奖了！
-Molly... -Then, we must've won them!

1524
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:10,891
-莫莉… -我们要去，对吧？
-Molly... -Well, we're going, aren't we?
