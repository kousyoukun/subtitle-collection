18
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,058
我趕得上早一班飛機，對嗎？
So, I'm gonna make it onto the earlier flight, right?

19
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,434
行李要拖運嗎？
Are you gonna check that?

20
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,520
我會帶上機，裡面有重要東西

那個袋子重到爆

Those are exhaust tips for a '74 Z-28.

30
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,547
我專門整理舊車…
I restore old cars, so...

31

吹風機
Hair-dryer.

33

撞上癮了

Well, I just checked in for this one, like, 10 minutes ago.

45
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,427
一定是哪裡出錯了

49
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,686
抱歉，座位真的全滿了
I'm sorry, we are completely sold out.

50
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,106
你能幫我想想辦法嗎？我小妹耶
Listen, can you help me out for a second? She's my little sister.

51
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,608
她叫艾波兒，我是茱恩
She's April, I'm June,

52
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,693
她等著我明天陪她走紅毯
she's counting on me to march her down the aisle tomorrow.

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,070
好溫馨
That's very sweet,

54
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,864
搭11點50分的晚班機 您明早就會抵達
but the 11:50 will get you there tomorrow morning with plenty of time.

55
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,908
登機證，先生？
Your boarding pass, sir?

56
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,454
有時事出必有因
Sometimes things happen for a reason.

57
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,415
一路順風，米勒先生
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Miller.

58
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,750
謝謝

00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,920
美國米德蘭航空77號班機最後登機通知

Would all passengers holding a valid boarding pass, please proceed...

63
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:49,724
我早該料到，他起肖到失控了
I should've seen it coming, boss. He went on tilt, he came undone.

64
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,269
我們這行如果失控大不了喝個幾杯
Coming undone in our business means you need a margarita.

65
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,813
不是在政府實驗室幹掉一票人後
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people in a government lab 

66
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,855
再把它炸掉
and blowing it up.

67
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,275
不是就能竊取重大機密
It doesn't mean stealing an object of critical importance.

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,734
他到底有沒有偷走賽佛？
Does he have the Zephyr or not?

69
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
我們相信有
We believe so.

70
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
你相信有
You believe so.

71
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,574
看一下
Check it out.

72
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,908
我不在乎你相信什麼，費茲
I don't care what you believe, Fitz.

73
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,076
收拾好你的爛攤子
I need you to clean your mess up.

74
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,160
倒帶再放一次
Go back and play it again.

75
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,328
我要拿到賽佛
I want the Zephyr.

76
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,914
我們會在他抵達波士頓時拿到手
We'll have it in hand by the time he lands in Boston.

77
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,126
查出她的身份和背景
Find out who and what she is.

78
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,962
要請威奇塔的分處逮捕她嗎？
Should I have the field office pick her up in Wichita?

79
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,339
我有更好的主意
I got a better idea.

80
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,343
赫文斯小姐
Miss Havens? 

81
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,512
我們替您找到機位了
We did find a seat for you.

82
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,017
請注意，抱歉延誤起飛
I'd like to have your attention, please. We apologize for the delay.

83
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,603
我們很快會從威奇塔機場出發
We will be departing Wichita Airport shortly.

84
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,770
「移動，警告」


85
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,147
感謝您的耐心
Thanks for your patience.

86
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,775
「艾瑪波拉路5826號」


87
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,778
我知道你只是依照公司政策做事
I know it's policy or whatever and it's just your job,

88
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,614
但這實在有點瞎
but it's kind of lame.

89
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,740
真是抱歉
Again, I apologize.

90
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,159
費茲，你動了什麼手腳？
Fitz. What did you do?

91
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,041
難怪航空公司會倒
It's no wonder these airlines are going out of business.

92
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,544
飛機上只有小貓兩三隻
We have been cleared onto the runway. There's nobody on the plane.

93
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,555
機長已開殷系好安全帶指示燈
The captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.

94
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,350
請坐在位置上直到指示燈熄滅
Please remain seated until the sign has been turned off

95
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,560
才能在機艙內走動
and it's safe to move about the cabin.

96
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,021
對了，我是茱恩
I'm June, by the way.

97
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,689
我是羅伊米勒
I'm Roy Miller.

98
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,107
幸會
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,192
彼此彼此
It's very nice to meet you.

100
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,153
龍舌蘭加冰塊？
Tequila on the rocks?

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,030
好，正是時候，謝了
Yeah. Just in time, thanks.

102
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,370
所以你小妹明天結婚？
So, your sister's getting married tomorrow?

103
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,830
-什麼？ -你小妹
-Excuse me? -Your sister.

104
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,500
她明天結婚，恭喜
She's getting married tomorrow. Congratulations.

105
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,918
是啊，謝了
Yeah, thanks.

106
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,176
羅伊，我不善於說謊
You know, Roy, I'm a bad liar.

107
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,095
抱歉，怎麼說？
I'm sorry, how's that?

108
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,181
艾波兒要結婚，不過是週六
April is getting married, but not till Saturday.

109
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,474
你唬到我了
You had me fooled.

110
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,060
可是我明天要試裝
Well, I do have a fitting tomorrow. 

111
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,896
所以我真的得回家
So, I do, actually, have to go home.

112
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,781
希望這趟飛行別太難熬
I hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.

113
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,412
很難說
It might be.

114
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,875
跑來威奇塔買化油器還真遠
Wichita is a long way to go for a carburetor.

115
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,794
這可不是一般的化油器
It's not just any carburetor. 

116
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,920
是三段式化油器
It's a triple deuce.

117
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,089
我在整理1966年的GTO
I'm restoring a '66 GTO.

118
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,591
堪薩斯州有最棒的零件廠
And Kansas has the best scrap.

119
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,718
真的？
Really?

120
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,386
我爸開修車廠
My dad had a garage,

121
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,264
我小時候，他買了這台車的底盤
and when I was a kid, he bought this chassis.

122
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,435
他經常帶我們到處找零件
He used to take us to yards, and search for parts, you know?

123
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,272
他於1998年過世，如今艾波兒結婚
He died in '98, and now that April's getting married

124
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,442
我心想，何不把車整理好？
I just figured, why not finish it up,

125
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,944
送她當作結婚禮物
give it to her sort of as a wedding present?

126
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,114
也算是老爸送的禮物
Kind of like a present from our dad, too, you know?

127
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,075
好感人
That's nice.

128
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,994
-是啊 -是啊
-Yeah. -Yeah.

129
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,630
我常想
I used to think that

130
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,803
有朝一日，當最後的零件裝上
someday, when the last part went in,

131
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,974
我會爬進那台車，發動它
I would just climb into that GTO and start it up.

132
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,854
一股勁兒地開，不停地開
Just drive and drive and drive, and just keep driving

133
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,316
直到抵達南美洲的盡頭
until I got to the tip of South America.

134
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,318
合恩角
Cape Horn.

135
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,320
對
Yeah.

136
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,655
那裡有美麗的島嶼
There's beautiful islands down there.

137
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,990
是嗎？

140
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,000
危險？
Dangerous?

141
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,046
它其實只是「永不」的代名詞
It's really just code for "never."

142
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,468
我常在想我還有什麼事沒做過
I think a lot about things I haven't done.

00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,411
你想做哪些事？
What's your list?

151
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,250
這個嘛…你的聽起來很不賴

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,681
不介意的話我放在這裡
I'll just put this up here, if that's all right.

156
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,895
不好意思
You know what?

157
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,190
我要去化妝室整理一下
I'm gonna go back and use the restroom.

158
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,734
我幫你
I'll help you.

159
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,236
謝了
Thanks.

160
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,870
亂流真多

-我馬上出來 -沒問題

00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,017
「在海角酒店陽台親吻陌生人」
"Kiss a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Cap"?

163
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,768
這是什麼台詞？
I mean, what kind of a line is that?

164
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,570
太浪漫了
I mean, it's, like, a really good line.

165
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,452
小姐？小姐？
Ma'am? Ma'am?

166
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,630
你有沒有看見他的手？

一下子就接住袋子

169
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,264
太不上道
Not cool.

00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,894
好
Okay.

171
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,958
這會有幫助
This will help.

172
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,226
夠了，結束了，羅伊
Enough. It's over, Roy.

173

我同意，夠了
Yeah, I agree. Enough.

174
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,022
賽佛在哪裡？
Where's the Zephyr?

175
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,212
那女的為什麼在機上？快說
Why is the girl on the plane? Tell me.

176
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,089
為什麼費茲安排她上機？

別動，米勒
Don't move, Miller.

178
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,983
好，你打算怎麼做？ 你打算怎麼做？
So what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

179
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,861
你打算讓這機會溜掉？
You're just gonna let this opportunity pass you by?

180
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,945
不，當然不行
No, of course you're not.

181
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,322
你要走出去，主動一點
You're gonna walk right through that door, you're gonna get it right.

182
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,741
反正你也不是第一次主動
It's not your first rodeo, woman.

183
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,589
嗨
Hey.

184
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,474
我決定也來一杯
I decided to join you.

185
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,753
抱歉，我…
I'm sorry. I...

186
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,880
不，沒關係…這樣很棒
No, no, don't... It's great.

187
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,964
抱歉
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,674
龍舌蘭和在高空都會令人興奮
It's just, like, the tequila and the altitude and everything.

189
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,134
我得告訴你一件事
There's something I've gotta tell you.

190
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,804
什麼？天啊，你有女朋友了
What? Oh, my God, you're in a relationship. 

191
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,930
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

192
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,557
不是，不是那樣
No, no, no. That's not it.

193
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,644
不是？我洗耳恭聽，是啥？
Okay, I'm all ears. What is it?

194
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,107
我們要降落了嗎？
Are we landing?

195
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,526
還沒
No, not yet.

196
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,487
還沒？
No?

197
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,823
聽著，不需要驚慌
Listen, there's no need to panic. 

198
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,701
我已經…控制情況
I have contained the situation.

199
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,162
情況？
Situation?

200
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,500
對，我們…失去了機長
Yeah. We've lost the pilots.

201
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,211
他們去哪了？
Where did they go?

202
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,505
應該是說他們死了
I mean, they're dead.

203
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,799
-機長死了 -被射殺
-The pilots are dead. -Shot. It's...

204
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,509
被射殺？
Shot?

205
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,512
誰幹的？
By who?

206
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,517
就是我
Well, me.

207
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,019
實際上我殺了正駕駛
Actually, I shot the first pilot.

208
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,230
他意外殺了副駕駛
He shot the second pilot accidentally. 

209
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,857
你懂…
It's just

210
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,862
就是這麼回事
one of those things.

211
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,755
說真的，這個好笑！
Seriously, this is great!

212
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,009
我大可放心了，你好鎮靜
Really, I'm relieved you are taking this so well.

213
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,391
你要去哪裡？
Where are you going?

214
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,519
我去看一下，想辦法降落
I'm just gonna go check on things and think about landing.

215
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,605
能幫個忙繫上安全帶嗎？
Would you mind putting your seatbelt on for me?

216
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,231
-那就太好了 -好
-That would be great. -Yeah.

217
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,457
太詭異了
This is weird.

218
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,473
求救，求救
Mayday. Mayday. 

219
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,807
美國米德蘭航空77號班機
This is US Midland Air 77 heavy.

220
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,934
這是怎麼回事？
What's happening? 

221
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,602
機內每個人真的都死了！
Everybody's dead out there!

222
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,854
過來，坐下
Come on in. Sit down. 

223
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,022
求救，求救，求救

224
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,190
這裡每個人都死了
Everybody's dead in here.

225
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,274
這是緊急事件
I'm declaring an emergency.

226
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,901
我的天啊！我們會墜機嗎？
Oh, my God! Are we going down?

227
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,985
什麼？
I'm sorry?

228
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,070
我們會墜機嗎？
Are we going down?

229
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,530
茱恩，只是快速下降，請坐下
No, June, it's just a rapid descent. Please, sit down.

230
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,951
抱歉，我想我聽夠這傢伙了
I'm sorry, I think I've heard enough of this guy.

231
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,994
你是飛行員嗎？你是誰？
Are you a pilot? Who are you?

232
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,287
肩帶
The shoulder straps.

233
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,956
把這個戴好
You can put those over, 

234
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,791
從右邊扣在座位上
and it clicks in right down there.

235
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,460
要扣在那裡，沒錯
You wanna click it right there, that's it.

236
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,463
好，我弄好了
Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay...

237
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,340
放下起落架，慢下來
Gear down, showdown.

238
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,302
我們幹嘛不降落在機場？
Why can't we just land in an airport?

239
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,805
不，最好不要
No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea.

240
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,181
他們會等著我們
They'll be waiting for us.

241
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,642
什麼意思？等著我們？誰？
What do you mean? Waiting for us?  Who? 

242
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,519
我想你知道愈少愈好
I think the less you know, the better.

243
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,312
什麼？
What?

244
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,690
好，我們要在這裡降落了
Okay, we're gonna touch down here.

245
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,941
天啊！
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

246
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,408
-有卡車，有卡車！ -好

有卡車！
That's a truck!

249
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,708
我的天啊！我的天啊！
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

250
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,465
-有彎路，有彎路！ -我看到了
-That's a curve. That's a curve! -I see it. I see it.

251
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,141
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

252
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,311
天啊！
Oh, God!

253
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,578
太好了
Okay, this is good.

254
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,163
哪裡好？
What's good?

255
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,751
喝一口
Take a sip of that.

256
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,878
可以放鬆一下
It'll take the edge off.

257
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
你中彈了？
Are you shot?

258
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
對，免騖啦
Yeah, how about that?

259
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,557
只是擦傷，這是好消息
It's just a scrape. That's good news.

260
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,727
茱恩，我們需要…
June, we have to

261
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,105
討論下一步
discuss what's gonna happen next.

262
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,025
你需要去醫院，不然去監獄？
You need to go to the hospital. Prison, maybe?

263
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,403
有些人會來找你，壞人
Some people are gonna come looking for you now. Bad people.

264
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,280
我感覺怪怪的
You know, I feel a little weird.

265
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,283
對，過幾分鐘你就會昏倒
Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep, which should be in a couple of minutes.

266
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,702
-什麼？ -我要你聽好
-What? -I need you to listen, June.

267
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,371
你對我下藥？
Did you drug me?

268
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,705
對
Yes.

269
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,208
-你對我下藥 -對，為了你著想
-You drugged me. -Yeah, it's for your own good.

270
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,920
這些壞人會找上你，他們會問起我
Now, look. These bad people who are going to come and see you, they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?

271
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,090
你得回答你不認識我
And you need to tell them you don't know me.

272
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,758
萊恩？
-June? June? -Okay.

273
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,802
你得說你什麼都不記得
You need to tell them you don't remember anything.

274
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,888
你無論如何要避免上他們的車
And you need to avoid getting in any vehicle with them at all costs.

275
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,807
好，  「他們」是誰？
Okay, who are "them"?

276
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,558
他們是狠角色
Well, they're serious people, June.

277
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,478
他們會自稱是聯邦調查局探員
They'll probably identify themselves as federal agents, 

278
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
他們會誤導你
and they'll DIP you.

279
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,440
誤導我怎樣？
Dip me? In what?

280
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,734
反情報規則，他們會瞎掰我的事
Dis-Information Protocol. They'll tell you a story about me.

281
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,821
說我精神不穩定、有妄想症
About how I'm mentally unstable, paranoid.

282
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,698
暴力又危險
How I'm violent and dangerous, 

283
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,784
聽起來都很像真的
and it'll all sound very convincing.

284
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,619
我已經被說服了
I'm already convinced.

285
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,705
一些基本的關鍵字會出現
There's a few common DIP keywords to listen for.

286
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,873
安慰的字眼
Reassuring words. Words like, 

287
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,836
比如穩定、確保、安全
"stabilize," "secure," "safe."

288
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,295
只要他們提到這些字眼
If they say these words, 

289
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,380
尤其重覆時…
particularly with repetition...

290
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,506
好
Okay.

291
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,966
這表示他們會殺了你
...it means they're going to kill you.

292
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,092
天啊！
Oh, God!

293
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,512
或者把你長期關到境外某處
Or intern you somewhere offshore for a very long time.

294
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,721
-懂嗎？ -懂
-Okay? -Okay.

295
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,807
仔細聽我說，只要他們說你很安全…
Now, stay with me. If they tell you you're safe...

296
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,934
如果他們說我很安全
If they tell me I'm safe,

297
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,978
他們會殺了我
they're gonna kill me.

298
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,354
別上什麼？
Don't get in what? 

299
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,564
上車
Vehicles.

300
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:32,898
任何車
Any vehicles.

301
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,024
好，任何車
Okay, any vehicles.

302
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,359
-要快點逃 -我會逃
-Just run. -I'll run.

303
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,527
快逃-快逃
-Run. -Run.

304
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,696
要是他們問起我…
And if they ask you about me...

305
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,366
我不認識你
I don't know you. 

306
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,659
我完全不認識你
I don't know you at all.

307
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,704
羅伊，你到底是誰？
Who are you, Roy?

308
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,197
「茱恩，很高興認識你，羅伊」


309
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,709
…混著雨和雪，適合滑雪區
... a mixing of rain and snow, good for ski country, but probably...

310
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,002
「吃頓豐盛早餐，茱恩」


311
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,378
-謝了，安卓 -不答氣
-Thanks, Andrea. -You're welcome.

312
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,339
接著回到今早的頭條新聞
Now, back to our top news story of the morning.

313
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,217
布萊德利摩斯在現場報導
Here's Bradley Moss, with an on-the-scene report.

314
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,845
根據聯邦航空局的消息 昨晚約7點半時
According to FAA sources, at approximately 7:30 last night,

315
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,849
與威奇塔飛往波士頓的一架客機 失去所有聯繫
all contact was lost with a Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita.

316
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,061
這架飛機顯然飛經不穩定氣流
The plane was apparently passing through an area of turbulence

317
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,187
可能遭亂流或閃電影響
and may have met up with wind shear

318
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,564
造成斷電
or a lightning storm causing an electrical failure.

319
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,108
目前一切都還是推測
Now, this is all conjecture at this point,

320
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,236
證據只有… 在印地安那州玉米田中的殘骸
as all that's left is a crater in an Indiana cornfield.

321
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,737
來了
Coming!

322
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,239
「記得，別告訴任何人」


323
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,912
羅德尼？
Rodney?

324
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,582
謝天謝地，我想確定你安然無恙
Thank God. I wanted to make sure you were okay.

325
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,708
怎麼了？
Yeah, why?

326
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,043
你不是昨天從堪薩斯飛回來？
You were on that flight from Kansas, right?

327
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,003
-對 -我看新聞說墜機了
-Yeah. -I saw on the news about the crash.

328
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,588
什麼新聞？什麼墜機？
What news? What crash?

329
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,384
-沒事了，你活著就好 -我活著沒錯
-Anyway, you're alive. -I'm alive, yeah.

330
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:28,097
-我看到了，太好了 -茱恩，我在想…
Sure, that's cool. Hey, but, June, you know...

331
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,891
我告訴自己，只要得知你活著
I
