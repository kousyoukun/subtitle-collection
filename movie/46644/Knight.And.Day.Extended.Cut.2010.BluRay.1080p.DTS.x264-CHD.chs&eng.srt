18
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,058

So, I'm gonna make it onto the earlier flight, right?

19
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,434
行李要拖运吗？

那个袋子重到爆

30
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,547

抱歉，座位真的全满了
I'm sorry, we are completely sold out.

50
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,106
你能帮我想想办法吗？我小妹耶
Listen, can you help me out for a second? She's my little sister.

51
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,608
她叫艾波儿，我是茱恩
She's April, I'm June,

52
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,693
她等着我明天陪她走红毯

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,070
好温馨
That's very sweet,

54
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,864
搭11点50分的晚班机 您明早就会抵达
but the 11:50 will get you there tomorrow morning with plenty of time.

55
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,908
登机证，先生？

56
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,454
有时事出必有因

Would all passengers holding a valid boarding pass, please proceed...

63
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:49,724
我早该料到，他起肖到失控了
I should've seen it coming, boss. He went on tilt, he came undone.

64
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,269
我们这行如果失控大不了喝个几杯
Coming undone in our business means you need a margarita.

65
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,813
不是在政府实验室干掉一票人后
It doesn't mean capping a dozen people in a government lab 

66
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,855
再把它炸掉
and blowing it up.

67
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,275
不是就能窃取重大机密
It doesn't mean stealing an object of critical importance.

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,734
他到底有没有偷走赛佛？
Does he have the Zephyr or not?

69
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
我们相信有
We believe so.

70
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
你相信有
You believe so.

71
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,574
看一下
Check it out.

72
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,908
我不在乎你相信什么，费兹
I don't care what you believe, Fitz.

73
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,076
收拾好你的烂摊子
I need you to clean your mess up.

74
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,160
倒带再放一次
Go back and play it again.

75
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,328
我要拿到赛佛
I want the Zephyr.

76
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,914
我们会在他抵达波士顿时拿到手
We'll have it in hand by the time he lands in Boston.

77
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,126
查出她的身分和背景
Find out who and what she is.

78
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,962
要请威奇塔的分处逮捕她吗？
Should I have the field office pick her up in Wichita?

79
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,339
我有更好的主意
I got a better idea.

80
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,343
赫文斯小姐
Miss Havens? 

81
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,512
我们替您找到机位了
We did find a seat for you.

82
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,017
请注意，抱歉延误起飞
I'd like to have your attention, please. We apologize for the delay.

83
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,603
我们很快会从威奇塔机场出发
We will be departing Wichita Airport shortly.

84
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,770
“移动，警告”


85
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,147
感谢您的耐心
Thanks for your patience.

86
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,775
“艾玛波拉路5826号”


87
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,778
我知道你只是依照公司政策做事
I know it's policy or whatever and it's just your job,

88
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,614
但这实在有点瞎
but it's kind of lame.

89
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,740
真是抱歉
Again, I apologize.

90
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,159
费兹，你动了什么手脚？
Fitz. What did you do?

91
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,041
难怪航空公司会倒
It's no wonder these airlines are going out of business.

92
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,544
飞机上只有小猫两三只
We have been cleared onto the runway. There's nobody on the plane.

93
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,555
机长已开殷系好安全带指示灯
The captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign.

94
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,350
请坐在位置上直到指示灯熄灭
Please remain seated until the sign has been turned off

95
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,560
才能在机舱内走动
and it's safe to move about the cabin.

96
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,021
对了，我是茱恩
I'm June, by the way.

97
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,689
我是罗伊米勒
I'm Roy Miller.

98
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,107
幸会
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,192
彼此彼此
It's very nice to meet you.

100
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,153
龙舌兰加冰块？
Tequila on the rocks?

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,030
好，正是时候，谢了
Yeah. Just in time, thanks.

102
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,370
所以你小妹明天结婚？
So, your sister's getting married tomorrow?

103
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,830
-什么？ -你小妹
-Excuse me? -Your sister.

104
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,500
她明天结婚，恭喜
She's getting married tomorrow. Congratulations.

105
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,918
是啊，谢了
Yeah, thanks.

106
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,176
罗伊，我不善于说谎
You know, Roy, I'm a bad liar.

107
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,095
抱歉，怎么说？
I'm sorry, how's that?

108
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,181
艾波儿要结婚，不过是周六
April is getting married, but not till Saturday.

109
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,474
你唬到我了
You had me fooled.

110
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,060
可是我明天要试装
Well, I do have a fitting tomorrow. 

111
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,896
所以我真的得回家
So, I do, actually, have to go home.

112
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,781
希望这趟飞行别太难熬
I hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.

113
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,412
很难说
It might be.

114
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,875
跑来威奇塔买化油器还真远
Wichita is a long way to go for a carburetor.

115
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,794
这可不是一般的化油器
It's not just any carburetor. 

116
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,920
是三段式化油器
It's a triple deuce.

117
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,089
我在整理1966年的GTO
I'm restoring a '66 GTO.

118
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,591
堪萨斯州有最棒的零件厂
And Kansas has the best scrap.

119
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,718
真的？
Really?

120
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,386
我爸开修车厂
My dad had a garage,

121
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,264
我小时候，他买了这台车的底盘
and when I was a kid, he bought this chassis.

122
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,435
他经常带我们到处找零件
He used to take us to yards, and search for parts, you know?

123
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,272
他于1998年过世，如今艾波儿结婚
He died in '98, and now that April's getting married

124
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,442
我心想，何不把车整理好？
I just figured, why not finish it up,

125
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,944
送她当作结婚礼物
give it to her sort of as a wedding present?

126
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,114
也算是老爸送的礼物
Kind of like a present from our dad, too, you know?

127
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,075
好感人
That's nice.

128
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,994
-是啊 -是啊
-Yeah. -Yeah.

129
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,630
我常想
I used to think that

130
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,803
有朝一日，当最后的零件装上
someday, when the last part went in,

131
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,974
我会爬进那台车，发动它
I would just climb into that GTO and start it up.

132
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,854
一股劲儿地开，不停地开
Just drive and drive and drive, and just keep driving

133
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,316
直到抵达南美洲的尽头
until I got to the tip of South America.

134
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,318
合恩角
Cape Horn.

135
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,320
对
Yeah.

136
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,655
那里有美丽的岛屿
There's beautiful islands down there.

137
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,990
是吗？
Yeah?

138
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,283
海盗岛
Pirate islands.

139
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,207
“有朝一日”是个危险字眼
Yeah, "someday." That's a dangerous word.

140
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,000
危险？
Dangerous?

141
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,046
它其实只是“永不”的代名词
It's really just code for "never."

142
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,468
我常在想我还有什么事没做过
I think a lot about things I haven't done.

143
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,348

只有摩托车和背包相伴

146
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,524
在海角酒店阳台亲吻陌生人

147
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,694

Where is that?

148
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,655
南法
South of France.

149
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,576
那你呢？
What about you? 

150
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,411
你想做哪些事？
What's your list?

151
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,250
这个嘛…你的听起来很不赖
Well, yours sounds pretty good.

152
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,505
天啊
Wow.

153
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,675
谢了
Thanks.

154
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,718
别客气
It's no problem.

155
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,681
不介意的话我放在这里
I'll just put this up here, if that's all right.

156
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,895
不好意思
You know what?

157
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,190
我要去化妆室整理一下
I'm gonna go back and use the restroom.

158
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,734
我帮你
I'll help you.

159
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,236
谢了
Thanks.

160
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,870
乱流真多
Lots of turbulence, huh?

161
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,878
-我马上出来 -没问题
-I'll be out in a minute. -Sure

162
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,017
“在海角酒店阳台亲吻陌生人”
"Kiss a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Cap"?

163
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,768
这是什么台词？
I mean, what kind of a line is that?

164
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,570
太浪漫了
I mean, it's, like, a really good line.

165
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,452
小姐？小姐？
Ma'am? Ma'am?

166
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,630
你有没有看见他的手？
Did you see his hands, by any chance?

167
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,424
一下子就接住袋子
They just, like, snatched that bag right out of the air.

168
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,426
超快的反射动作
Lightning-fast reflexes.

169
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,264
太不上道
Not cool.

170
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,894
好
Okay.

171
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,958
这会有帮助
This will help.

172
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,226
够了，结束了，罗伊
Enough. It's over, Roy.

173
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,187
我同意，够了
Yeah, I agree. Enough.

174
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,022
赛佛在哪里？
Where's the Zephyr?

175
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,212
那女的为什么在机上？快说
Why is the girl on the plane? Tell me.

176
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,089
为什么费兹安排她上机？
Why did Fitz put her on the plane?

177
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,635
别动，米勒
Don't move, Miller.

178
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,983
好，你打算怎么做？ 你打算怎么做？
So what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

179
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,861
你打算让这机会溜掉？
You're just gonna let this opportunity pass you by?

180
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,945
不，当然不行
No, of course you're not.

181
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,322
你要走出去，主动一点
You're gonna walk right through that door, you're gonna get it right.

182
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,741
反正你也不是第一次主动
It's not your first rodeo, woman.

183
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,589
嗨
Hey.

184
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,474
我决定也来一杯
I decided to join you.

185
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,753
抱歉，我…
I'm sorry. I...

186
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,880
不，没关系…这样很棒
No, no, don't... It's great.

187
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,964
抱歉
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,674
龙舌兰和在高空都会令人兴奋
It's just, like, the tequila and the altitude and everything.

189
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,134
我得告诉你一件事
There's something I've gotta tell you.

190
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,804
什么？天啊，你有女朋友了
What? Oh, my God, you're in a relationship. 

191
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,930
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

192
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,557
不是，不是那样
No, no, no. That's not it.

193
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,644
不是？我洗耳恭听，是啥？
Okay, I'm all ears. What is it?

194
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,107
我们要降落了吗？
Are we landing?

195
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,526
还没
No, not yet.

196
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,487
还没？
No?

197
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,823
听着，不需要惊慌
Listen, there's no need to panic. 

198
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,701
我已经…控制情况
I have contained the situation.

199
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,162
情况？
Situation?

200
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,500
对，我们…失去了机长
Yeah. We've lost the pilots.

201
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,211
他们去哪了？
Where did they go?

202
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,505
应该是说他们死了
I mean, they're dead.

203
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,799
-机长死了 -被射杀
-The pilots are dead. -Shot. It's...

204
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,509
被射杀？
Shot?

205
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,512
谁干的？
By who?

206
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,517
就是我
Well, me.

207
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,019
实际上我杀了正驾驶
Actually, I shot the first pilot.

208
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,230
他意外杀了副驾驶
He shot the second pilot accidentally. 

209
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,857
你懂…
It's just

210
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,862
就是这么回事
one of those things.

211
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,755
说真的，这个好笑！
Seriously, this is great!

212
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,009
我大可放心了，你好镇静
Really, I'm relieved you are taking this so well.

213
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,391
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

214
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,519
我去看一下，想办法降落
I'm just gonna go check on things and think about landing.

215
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,605
能帮个忙系上安全带吗？
Would you mind putting your seatbelt on for me?

216
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,231
-那就太好了 -好
-That would be great. -Yeah.

217
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,457
太诡异了
This is weird.

218
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,473
求救，求救
Mayday. Mayday. 

219
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,807
美国米德兰航空77号班机
This is US Midland Air 77 heavy.

220
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:57,934
这是怎么回事？
What's happening? 

221
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,602
机内每个人真的都死了！
Everybody's dead out there!

222
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,854
过来，坐下
Come on in. Sit down. 

223
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,022
求救，求救，求救
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

224
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,190
这里每个人都死了
Everybody's dead in here.

225
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,274
这是紧急事件
I'm declaring an emergency.

226
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,901
我的天啊！我们会坠机吗？
Oh, my God! Are we going down?

227
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,985
什么？
I'm sorry?

228
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,070
我们会坠机吗？
Are we going down?

229
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,530
茱恩，只是快速下降，请坐下
No, June, it's just a rapid descent. Please, sit down.

230
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,951
抱歉，我想我听够这家伙了
I'm sorry, I think I've heard enough of this guy.

231
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,994
你是飞行员吗？你是谁？
Are you a pilot? Who are you?

232
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,287
肩带
The shoulder straps.

233
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,956
把这个戴好
You can put those over, 

234
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,791
从右边扣在座位上
and it clicks in right down there.

235
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,460
要扣在那里，没错
You wanna click it right there, that's it.

236
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,463
好，我弄好了
Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay...

237
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,340
放下起落架，慢下来
Gear down, showdown.

238
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,302
我们干嘛不降落在机场？
Why can't we just land in an airport?

239
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,805
不，最好不要
No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea.

240
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,181
他们会等着我们
They'll be waiting for us.

241
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,642
什么意思？等着我们？谁？
What do you mean? Waiting for us?  Who? 

242
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,519
我想你知道愈少愈好
I think the less you know, the better.

243
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,312
什么？
What?

244
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,690
好，我们要在这里降落了
Okay, we're gonna touch down here.

245
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,941
天啊！
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

246
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,408
-有卡车，有卡车！ -好
-That's a truck. That's a truck! -Yeah.

247
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,701
-有卡车！ -没错
-That's a truck! -Yup.

248
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,827
有卡车！
That's a truck!

249
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,708
我的天啊！我的天啊！
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

250
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,465
-有弯路，有弯路！ -我看到了
-That's a curve. That's a curve! -I see it. I see it.

251
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,141
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

252
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,311
天啊！
Oh, God!

253
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,578
太好了
Okay, this is good.

254
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,163
哪里好？
What's good?

255
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,751
喝一口
Take a sip of that.

256
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,878
可以放松一下
It'll take the edge off.

257
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
你中弹了？
Are you shot?

258
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
对，免骛啦
Yeah, how about that?

259
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,557
只是擦伤，这是好消息
It's just a scrape. That's good news.

260
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,727
茱恩，我们需要…
June, we have to

261
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,105
讨论下一步
discuss what's gonna happen next.

262
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,025
你需要去医院，不然去监狱？
You need to go to the hospital. Prison, maybe?

263
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,403
有些人会来找你，坏人
Some people are gonna come looking for you now. Bad people.

264
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,280
我感觉怪怪的
You know, I feel a little weird.

265
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,283
对，过几分钟你就会昏倒
Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep, which should be in a couple of minutes.

266
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,702
-什么？ -我要你听好
-What? -I need you to listen, June.

267
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,371
你对我下药？
Did you drug me?

268
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,705
对
Yes.

269
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,208
-你对我下药 -对，为了你着想
-You drugged me. -Yeah, it's for your own good.

270
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,920
这些坏人会找上你，他们会问起我
Now, look. These bad people who are going to come and see you, they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?

271
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,090
你得回答你不认识我
And you need to tell them you don't know me.

272
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,758
莱恩？
-June? June? -Okay.

273
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,802
你得说你什么都不记得
You need to tell them you don't remember anything.

274
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,888
你无论如何要避免上他们的车
And you need to avoid getting in any vehicle with them at all costs.

275
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,807
好，  “他们”是谁？
Okay, who are "them"?

276
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,558
他们是狠角色
Well, they're serious people, June.

277
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,478
他们会自称是联邦调查局探员
They'll probably identify themselves as federal agents, 

278
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
他们会误导你
and they'll DIP you.

279
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,440
误导我怎样？
Dip me? In what?

280
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,734
反情报规则，他们会瞎掰我的事
Dis-Information Protocol. They'll tell you a story about me.

281
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,821
说我精神不稳定、有妄想症
About how I'm mentally unstable, paranoid.

282
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,698
暴力又危险
How I'm violent and dangerous, 

283
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,784
听起来都很像真的
and it'll all sound very convincing.

284
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,619
我已经被说服了
I'm already convinced.

285
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,705
一些基本的关键字会出现
There's a few common DIP keywords to listen for.

286
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,873
安慰的字眼
Reassuring words. Words like, 

287
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,836
比如稳定、确保、安全
"stabilize," "secure," "safe."

288
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,295
只要他们提到这些字眼
If they say these words, 

289
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,380
尤其重覆时…
particularly with repetition...

290
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,506
好
Okay.

291
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,966
这表示他们会杀了你
...it means they're going to kill you.

292
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,092
天啊！
Oh, God!

293
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,512
或者把你长期关到境外某处
Or intern you somewhere offshore for a very long time.

294
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,721
-懂吗？ -懂
-Okay? -Okay.

295
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,807
仔细听我说，只要他们说你很安全…
Now, stay with me. If they tell you you're safe...

296
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,934
如果他们说我很安全
If they tell me I'm safe,

297
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,978
他们会杀了我
they're gonna kill me.

298
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,354
别上什么？
Don't get in what? 

299
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,564
上车
Vehicles.

300
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:32,898
任何车
Any vehicles.

301
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,024
好，任何车
Okay, any vehicles.

302
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,359
-要快点逃 -我会逃
-Just run. -I'll run.

303
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,527
快逃-快逃
-Run. -Run.

304
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,696
要是他们问起我…
And if they ask you about me...

305
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,366
我不认识你
I don't know you. 

306
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,659
我完全不认识你
I don't know you at all.

307
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,704
罗伊，你到底是谁？
Who are you, Roy?

308
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,197
“茱恩，很高兴认识你，罗伊”


309
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,709
…混着雨和雪，适合滑雪区
... a mixing of rain and snow, good for ski country, but probably...

310
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,002
“吃顿丰盛早餐，茱恩”


311
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,378
-谢了，安卓 -不答气
-Thanks, Andrea. -You're welcome.

312
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,339
接着回到今早的头条新闻
Now, back to our top news story of the morning.

313
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,217
布莱德利摩斯在现场报导
Here's Bradley Moss, with an on-the-scene report.

314
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,845
根据联邦航空局的消息 昨晚约7点半时
According to FAA sources, at approximately 7:30 last night,

315
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,849
与威奇塔飞往波士顿的一架客机 失去所有联系
all contact was lost with a Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita.

316
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,061
这架飞机显然飞经不稳定气流
The plane was apparently passing through an area of turbulence

317
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,187
可能遭乱流或闪电影响
and may have met up with wind shear

318
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,564
造成断电
or a lightning storm causing an electrical failure.

319
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,108
目前一切都还是推测
Now, this is all conjecture at this point,

320
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,236
证据只有… 在印地安那州玉米田中的残骸
as all that's left is a crater in an Indiana cornfield.

321
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,737
来了
Coming!

322
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,239
“记得，别告诉任何人”


323
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,912
罗德尼？
Rodney?

324
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,582
谢天谢地，我想确定你安然无恙
Thank God. I wanted to make sure you were okay.

325
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,708
怎么了？
Yeah, why?

326
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,043
你不是昨天从堪萨斯飞回来？
You were on that flight from Kansas, right?

327
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,003
-对 -我看新闻说坠机了
-Yeah. -I saw on the news about the crash.

328
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,588
什么新闻？什么坠机？
What news? What crash?

329
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,384
-没事了，你活着就好 -我活着没错
-Anyway, you're alive. -I'm alive, yeah.

330
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:28,097
-我看到了，太好了 -茱恩，我在想…
Sure, that's cool. Hey, but, June, you know...

331
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,891
我告诉自己，只要得知你活着
I told myself that if I found you alive,

332
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,936
我要邀你共进晚餐
that I was gonna ask you to dinner.

333
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,022
罗德尼，人分手以后 就不应该再约会
Rodney, people, when they break up, they're not supposed to have dates

334
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,025
那就别说是约会 说消防检查好了
so don't call it a date. Call it a fire inspection!

335
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,945
我晚点打给你好吗？
How about I call you later, okay?

336
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,617
不要告诉别人我在说什么
Don't tell anybody. What I'm talking about.

337
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,636
只是又一天，平常的一天，没事
It's just another day. It's just a normal day. Okay.

338
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,390
威尔莫，我有好东西
Hey, Willmer. I've got some goodies.

339
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,310
天啊，你拿到化油器了
Jesus, you got the deuce

340
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,646
威尔莫，当我回来时会来拿
Will, I'll grab it when I get back in

341
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,984
没事，只不过又是一天
Everything's OK! It's just another day

342
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,530
没事
Nothing happened.

343
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,920
目标移动中
She's moving.

344
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,340
天啊！
Wow!

345
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,301
靴子真是可爱
And gotta love the boots.

346
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,304
不好意思
Yeah, you know.

347
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,765
我保证当天会穿高跟鞋
I promise I'll wear heels on the day.

348
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,808
-能跟你谈一下吗？ -好
-Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? -Yeah.

349
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,273
这个周末，我想到爸的庞帝克
So, this weekend, I was thinking about Dad's GTO.

350
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,777
-真的？ -对，就一直停在车库里
-Really? -Yeah, it's just sitting there.

351
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,031
我想问你愿意卖掉它吗？
And I was wondering how you wou
