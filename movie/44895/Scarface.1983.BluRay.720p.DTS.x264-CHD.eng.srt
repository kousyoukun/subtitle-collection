1
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,384
What do you call yourself, huh?

2
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,680
Antonio Montana.

3
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,849
And you, what you call yourself?

4
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,059
Where'd you learn English, Tony?

5
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,269
In school.

6
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,647
And my father, he was from the United States.

7
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,191
Just like you, you know?

8
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,485
He was a Yankee.

9
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,071
He used to take me a lot to the movies.

10
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,239
I learned.

11
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,160
I watch the guys like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney.

12
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,540
They teach me to talk. I like those guys.

13
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,169
I always know one day I'm coming here, United States.

14
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,795
So where's your old man now?

15
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,006
He dead. He die.

16
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,300
Sometime. Somewhere.

17
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,468
Mother?

18
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,594
She dead, too.

19
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,304
What kind of work you do in Cuba?

20
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,847
You know, things.

21
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,975
I was this, that.

22
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,436
Construction business.

23
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,190
I work a lot with my hands. I was in the Army.

24
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,067
Any family in the States?

25
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,443
Cousins, brother-in-law, anybody?

26
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,655
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

27
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,782
You ever been to jail, Tony?

28
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,577
Me? Jail? No way, no.

29
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,080
Been in a mental hospital?

30
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,290
Oh, yeah. On the boat coming over.

31
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,753
What about homosexuality, Tony? You like men, huh?

32
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,464
You like to dress up like a woman?

33
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,634
What is wrong with this guy? He kidding me or what?

34
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,970
Just answer the questions, Tony.

35
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,263
Okay. No.

36
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,516
Fuck, no.

37
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,395
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?

38
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,105
- Never, man. - Heroin?

39
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,398
Cocaine?

40
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,649
No.

41
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,737
Where'd you get the beauty scar, tough guy? Eating pussy?

42
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,492
How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy?

43
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,662
This was when I was a kid, you know?

44
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,746
Mmm-hmm.

45
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,958
You should see the other kid. You can't recognize him.

46
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,251
And this?

47
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,546
What? That's nothing. That's from my sweetheart.

48
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,339
Sweetheart, my ass!

49
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,133
We've been seeing more and more of these.

50
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,885
Some kind of code these guys used in the can.

51
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,471
Pitchfork means an assassin or something.

52
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,056
You want to tell us about it,

53
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,101
or you want to take a trip to the detention center?

54
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,147
Okay, you got me.

55
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,232
I was in the can one time.

56
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,151
For buying dollars. Big deal.

57
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,360
That's pretty funny, Tony.

58
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,528
That's true.

59
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,447
It was a Canadian tourist.

60
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,782
Did you mug him first? Get him out of here!

61
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,992
Come on!

62
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,160
So I fuck up!

63
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,661
Let me talk to this guy.

64
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,580
Please! Let me talk to him a minute.

65
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,998
You a Communist?

66
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,125
Huh?

67
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,294
How'd you like it?

68
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,920
They tell you always what to do,

69
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,256
what to think, what to feel.

70
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,799
Do you want to be like a sheep?

71
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,051
Like all those other people?

72
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,012
I don't have to listen to this!

73
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,889
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?

74
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,141
You own nothing, you got nothing!

75
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,603
Do you want a chivato on every corner,

76
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,188
watching everything you do?

77
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,939
Everything you say, man?

78
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,776
You know I eat octopus three times a day?

79
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,236
I got fucking octopus coming out of my ears.

80
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,656
I got fucking Russian shoes, my feet's coming through.

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,742
How'd you like that?

82
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,953
You want me to stay there and do nothing?

83
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,415
I'm no fucking criminal, man. I'm no puta or thief.

84
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:00,252
I'm Tony Montana, a political prisoner from Cuba.

85
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,547
I want my fucking human rights, now!

86
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,675
Like President Jimmy Carter says. Okay?

87
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,888
Carter should see this human right. He's really good.

88
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:11,972
What do you say?

89
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,766
I don't believe any of this shit!

90
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,601
They all sound alike to me.

91
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,062
That Castro is shitting all over us.

92
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,065
Send the bastard to Freedom Town. Let them see him.

93
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,149
Get him out of here.

94
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,234
You know something?

95
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,401
You can send me anywhere.

96
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,779
Here, there, this, that. It don't matter.

97
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,531
There's nothing you can do to me

98
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,865
that Castro hasn't done...

99
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,283
Get him out of here!

100
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,871
- So? - So?

101
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,290
What'd you tell them?

102
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,334
What you told me to tell them.

103
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,129
That we... I was in sanitation.

104
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,048
They didn't go for it.

105
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,299
Sanitation?

106
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,467
Yeah.

107
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,302
I told you to tell them

108
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,140
you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.

109
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,559
Sanitarium. Yeah.

110
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,018
You didn't tell me that.

111
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:03,023
No, I told you to say you had TB and you was in a sanitarium.

112
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,525
You was cured.

113
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,945
When did you tell me that?

114
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,113
You should've kept your mouth shut.

115
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,490
They'd think you was a horse and let you out.

116
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,386
Tony! Montana!

117
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,514
Tony Montana! Come here.

118
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,851
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.

119
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,020
Come on, man. It's important.

120
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,065
So close, man. Come on.

121
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,359
I gotta talk to you.

122
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,526
Where are you going?

123
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,653
Leave him alone.

124
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,862
I got better things to do.

125
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,156
You're chicken, man. You almost made it.

126
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,867
Are you ready for some good news?

127
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,078
Sure. What you got, man?

128
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,247
We can be outta this place in 30 days.

129
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,875
Not only that, but we got a green card and a job in Miami.

130
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,253
Now are we made or are we made, man?

131
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,798
What do we gotta do? Go to Cuba and hit the Beard?

132
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,424
No, man, somebody else.

133
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,550
You're kidding.

134
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,885
No.

135
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,178
You're not kidding?

136
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,432
Guy named Rebenga, man. Emilio Rebenga.

137
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,684
Rebenga?

138
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,894
I know that name.

139
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,187
Yeah?

140
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,855
He's political. Yeah.

141
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,734
Well, he's coming in here today. Castro just sprung him.

142
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,697
This guy was one of the top dogs for Fidel in the early days.

143
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:19,368
Castro felt he couldn't trust him and threw him in jail.

144
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,788
But while he was on top, he tortured a few guys to death.

145
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,208
One of the guy's brothers is a rich guy in Miami now.

146
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,751
He wants the favor repaid.

147
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,628
That's where we come in.

148
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,549
It's ugly, man.

149
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,634
Yeah.

150
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,352
You tell your guys in Miami, your friend,

151
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,688
it'd be a pleasure.

152
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,232
I'd kill a Communist for fun,

153
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,820
but for a green card, I gonna carve him up real nice.

154
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,692
Rebenga!

155
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,359
From a friend you fucked!

156
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,934
That face. That's nice.

157
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,355
That doesn't look like me.

158
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,191
That looks pretty, man.

159
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,902
Whoo!

160
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:11,934
Fuck!

161
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,268
What's wrong, man?

162
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,066
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon.

163
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,735
I didn't come to the U.S. To break my fucking back.

164
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,279
He's coming! What do you want from me?

165
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,448
Fucking thing!

166
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,824
I told you.

167
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,745
What's wrong?

168
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,261
Look at that one.

169
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,888
That one in the pink. She's beautiful.

170
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,765
Look at those titties.

171
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,268
Look at that punk with her.

172
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,853
What's he got that I don't have?

173
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,149
Well, he's very handsome, for one thing, you know?

174
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,780
I mean, look at the way he dresses.

175
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,409
Come on. That's style, flash, pizzazz.

176
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,537
And a little coke money doesn't hurt nobody.

177
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,042
Look at this.

178
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,503
Fucking onions.

179
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,175
They ought to be picking gold from the street.

180
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,137
Oh, God, I can feel it.

181
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,016
There's two guys looking for you out there.

182
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,270
That's him, man. That's El mono. I told you.

183
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,063
Don't stay too fucking long.

184
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,566
We've got a lot of work to do.

185
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,212
Waldo! Good to see you, man.

186
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,799
This is my friend Tony Montana I've been telling you about.

187
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,261
Tony, that's Omar Suarez, and that's Waldo Rojas over there.

188
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,138
I got something for you.

189
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,265
Yeah? What do we gotta do?

190
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,475
Gotta unload a boat.

191
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,894
Marijuana. 45 tons. You get 500 each.

192
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,147
500? That's great.

193
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,523
You gotta be kidding.

194
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,070
500?

195
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,907
Who do you think we are, baggage handlers?

196
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,995
The going rate on a boat is 1,000 a night.

197
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,121
You know that.

198
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,041
First you gotta work your way up to 500.

199
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,669
What I did for you in Freedom Town, what was that?

200
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,921
That Rebenga hit was a game of dominoes?

201
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,005
That was something else.

202
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,590
- Shut up! - Take it easy.

203
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,259
What's with this dishwasher, chico?

204
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,011
Don't he know we could've got

205
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,971
any space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?

206
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,223
50 bucks!

207
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,432
Then why didn't you?

208
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,518
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher,

209
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,936
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

210
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,729
Who the fuck are you?

211
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,440
You can't do that, man!

212
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,818
The Colombians!

213
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,116
Okay, all right, big man!

214
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,951
You want to make some big bucks?

215
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,786
Let's see how tough you are.

216
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,288
You know something about cocaine?

217
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,420
You kidding me or what?

218
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,298
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday.

219
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,758
New guys.

220
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,386
They say they got two keys for us, for openers.

221
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,888
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.

222
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,515
I want you to go over there.

223
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,017
If it's what they say, pay them and bring it back.

224
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,186
Do that, you got 5 grand.

225
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,316
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

226
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,864
You know how to handle a machine gun?

227
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,116
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.

228
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,285
You gonna need a couple other guys.

229
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,828
That's no problem.

230
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,956
Be at Hector's bodega at noon, Friday.

231
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,958
You get the buy money then.

232
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,256
If anything happens to that buy money,

233
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,050
my boss will stick your heads up your asses

234
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,344
faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

235
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,888
I'm scared.

236
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,726
You're pushing your luck. Don't worry.

237
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,935
That was dumb.

238
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,937
You worry too much.

239
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,481
You'll have a heart attack.

240
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,734
You act like that guy's doing you a favor or something.

241
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,069
What's this with the Colombians?

242
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,780
What does it matter?

243
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,992
He says "Colombians," and you make these eyes...

244
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,204
I don't like fucking Colombians, okay?

245
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,873
What you guys doing?

246
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,042
There's a lot of dishes to be washed.

247
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,877
Wash them yourself.

248
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,213
I retire!

249
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,757
What the fuck you gonna do now?

250
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,966
Don't come back here!

251
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,260
I gotta look after my investment!

252
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,304
Fuck you guys!

253
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,722
Close the shop!

254
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,115
- Look at those tits. - She's begging for it.

255
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,201
Are you fucking crazy?

256
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,619
She's 103 years old.

257
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,372
Not that one, man! That one!

258
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,456
Which one?

259
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,499
The young one.

260
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,377
Move the fucking car. We're at a stop sign.

261
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,633
We're just staying loose up here. You gotta stay loose.

262
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,261
You can't worry. You'll have a heart attack.

263
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,721
- Just play it cool. - Miami Beach.

264
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,807
Miami Beach, man!

265
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,789
The money stays in the trunk till I come out.

266
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,500
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.

267
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,629
I'm not out in 15 minutes, something's wrong. Okay?

268
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,506
Room 9. You ready?

269
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,133
Sure thing.

270
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,570
Okay. You mind leaving the door open?

271
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,822
So my brother-in-law sees everything's okay.

272
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,908
Sure. No problem.

273
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,535
No problem.

274
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,748
Hello. This is Marta.

275
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,545
Marta, hello.

276
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,800
I am Hector.

277
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,885
And I am Tony.

278
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,684
So, Omar says you're okay.

279
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,562
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.

280
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,815
Okay.

281
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,906
So, you got the money?

282
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,786
You got the stuff?

283
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:13,581
Sure I have the stuff, but not right here with me now.

284
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,333
I got it close by.

285
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,965
I don't have the money either, man.

286
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,760
I have it close by, too.

287
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:28,930
Where?

288
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,933
In the car?

289
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,769
No, not in the car, man.

290
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,021
No?

291
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,691
How about you? Where you have your stuff?

292
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,445
Not far.

293
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,664
Okay. You want me to come in? We start over again?

294
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,001
Where you from, Tony?

295
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,421
What the fuck difference does it make where I'm from?

296
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,299
Take it easy, man.

297
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,636
I just want to get to know who I do business with.

298
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:13,308
You'll know me once you do business with me and stop fucking around.

299
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,976
Okay?

300
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,145
- What's the story? - Tony!

301
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,867
You know, Frog Face, you just fucked yourself.

302
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,786
You steal from me, you're dead.

303
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,079
Yeah?

304
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,002
You want to give me the cash,

305
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,547
or do I kill your brother first

306
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,008
before I kill you?

307
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:52,430
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass?

308
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,766
See if it fits.

309
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,895
Yeah? Okay.

310
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,962
Yeah, it's very important.

311
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,505
I understand it's important.

312
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,215
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

313
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,050
You forecasted an earthquake

314
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,636
in the 3-to-4-point range this morning.

315
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,931
We had an earthquake in the 3-to-4-point range.

316
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,057
I'm impressed.

317
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,225
Thank you, sir.

318
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,562
However, isn't it rather slender evidence...

319
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,616
You have such beautiful skin.

320
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,080
I like the way you...

321
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,752
I don't know what I'm supposed to do today, but...

322
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,403
Antonio, mira!

323
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,448
Watch what happens to your friend.

324
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,617
If you don't want this to happen to you,

325
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,285
give me the money.

326
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,555
Come on, come on.

327
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,485
Now the leg, huh.

328
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,333
Let's do it, man. Come on.

329
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,966
We're all gonna be all right.

330
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,020
Okay, cara cicatriz.

331
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,148
You can die, too. It makes no difference to me.

332
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,199
Last chance, pendejo!

333
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,201
Fuck you!

334
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,395
You okay?

335
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,938
Yeah, man. It went in and out.

336
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,285
Okay, take him out of here, quick!

337
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,287
Chi Chi! Get the yeyo.

338
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:49,852
Your turn.

339
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,145
I kill you!

340
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Die!

341
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,789
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!

342
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,624
Close the door!

343
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,473
Bunch of cowboys. Somebody fucked up.

344
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,184
Yeah, well, I'll check it out right away.

345
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,480
You do that, Omar. You do that.

346
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,107
You still got the money?

347
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,316
Yeah.

348
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,319
And I got the yeyo.

349
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,280
You got the yeyo?

350
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,573
Yeah, right.

351
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,074
Bring it here.

352
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,159
Fuck you.

353
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,661
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

354
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,038
Not you, me.

355
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,225
Nice fucking guy.

356
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,366
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.

357
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,868
Tony Montana.

358
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,786
Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.

359
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,205
You can call me Frank.

360
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,916
Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team,

361
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,585
even the fucking prosecutors around town,

362
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:38,836
they all call me Frank.

363
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,588
Okay, Frank. How are you?

364
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,632
Manny Ribera.

365
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,175
He caught one on the job.

366
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,384
Went right through.

367
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,053
We heard about that.

368
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,389
Omar, he tells me great things about you guys.

369
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,726
Well, Omar's okay.

370
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,979
Not to mention, of course, the nice job you did for me.

371
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,106
That Commie son of a bitch...

372
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,733
You don't have to mention that.

373
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,652
That was fun.

374
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:03,861
That was fun?

375
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,196
Damn right.

376
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,447
That was fun.

377
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,575
Sometimes it's fun.

378
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,078
What do you want to drink?

379
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,496
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?

380
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,749
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.

381
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,086
I need a guy with steel in his balls, Tony.

382
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,714
A guy like you. And I need him around me all the time.

383
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,176
You, Tony, and your compadre here.

384
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,806
Here's the stuff.

385
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,643
Two keys.

386
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,648
It cost my friend Angel his life. Here's the money.

387
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,693
My gift to you.

388
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,617
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

389
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,953
If people would do business the right way,

390
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,664
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

391
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,335
Don't think I don't appreciate the gesture.

392
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,338
You're gonna find, you stay loyal in this business,

393
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,800
you're gonna move up. You're gonna move up fast.

394
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,143
And you'll find out your biggest problem

395
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,186
is not bringing in the stuff,

396
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,272
but what to do with all the fucking cash!

397
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,984
I hope I have that problem someday.

398
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,902
You'll have that problem, don't worry.

399
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,988
Sit down over here.

400
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,117
Where the hell's Elvira?

401
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,119
It's late. Go find her, will you?

402
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,122
Jesus! Fucking broad.

403
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:42,668
She spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.

404
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,047
Gotta get her in between.

405
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:47,882
She's coming.

406
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,050
Yeah.

407
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,844
You gotta jump on her when she's not looking.

408
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,888
That's the best time.

409
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,392
What are you guys doing tonight?

410
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,604
You wanna go to a nice restaurant with me? You hungry?

411
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,814
I could eat a horse.

412
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,650
Okay, they'll cook you a horse.

413
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:06,942
I'll eat it.

414
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,201
Tell me, where'd they get you? Right there in the side?

415
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:17,662
It's nothing. It went right through me.

416
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:18,788
It hit the wall.

417
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,165
I ran out of bullets, like an asshole.

418
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,710
When I changed the clip, a guy who I thought I killed

419
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,962
wasn't dead and shot me.

420
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,465
The guy was behind me. I killed him.

421
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,800
How many bullets you catch?

422
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,009
Bullets? One bullet.

423
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,386
9mm.

424
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,399
Elvira, where the hell you been?

425
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,900
It's 10:00. I'm starving.

426
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,278
You're always hungry. You should try starving.

427
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,948
Where you going? Come on.

428
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:58,411
Come over here! I want you to meet a friend of mine.

429
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,124
Tony Montana. Elvira.

430
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,419
Hello.

431
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:07,837
Manny Ribera. Elvira.

432
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,214
So, there are five of us.

433
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,716
Where are we having dinner?

434
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,301
I thought we'd go to the Babylon Club.

435
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,345
Again? Again.

436
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,807
You know, Frank, if anyone wanted to assassinate you,

437
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,143
you wouldn't be too hard to find.

438
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,396
Assassinate me? Who the hell would want to kill me?

439
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,483
I got nothing but friends!

440
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,402
You never know.

441
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,487
Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.

442
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,323
The catcher? That son of a bitch,

443
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,825
he didn't get a base hit all season.

444
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,326
I should kill him!

445
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,480
You know who that is? Luis and Miguel Echevierra.

446
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,485
They got the biggest distribution setup from here to Houston,

447
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,862
Tucson, all down that way.

448
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,739
What do you think of that, huh?

449
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:01,867
Look.

450
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:07,498
You see that fat bastard? That's Nacho Contreras.

451
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,583
El Gordo!

452
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,545
He's got more cash than anybody in this place.

453
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,214
He's a real chazer!

454
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,012
You know what a chazer is?

455
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,682
No, Frank, you tell me. What is a chazer?

456
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,351
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

457
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,479
A guy who wants more than he needs.

458
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,189
He don't fly straight no more.

459
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,859
So, it comes down to one thing,

460
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,695
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

461
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,866
Lesson Number 1:

462
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,120
Don't underestimate

463
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,622
the other guy's greed!

464
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,460
Don't get high on your own supply.

465
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,921
That's right. Lesson Number 2:

466
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,798
Don't get high on your own supply.

467
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,467
Course, not everybody follows the rules.

468
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,892
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

469
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,310
That is '64?

470
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,728
The best, Mr. Lopez.

471
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,396
Omar, you pour it, and you bring

472
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,273
another bottle right away, will you?

473
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,900
Pleasure, Mr. Lopez.

474
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:21,614
$550 for this bottle, Tony. What do you think of that?

475
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,823
That's pretty good.

476
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,326
For a bunch of fucking grapes.

477
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,999
So, here's to old friends and to new friends.

478
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,676
How you like it, Tony?

479
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,512
That's good, Frank. That's good?

480
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,847
Like you say, man.

481
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,140
That's good!

482
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:54,104
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

483
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,149
I'm gonna get you $550 suits,

484
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,693
so you look real sharp.

485
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,863
'Cause I want you to work for me.

486
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,369
I want you and your boys to work with Omar here.

487
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:14,458
We are going to do something big next month.

488
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,296
We are running a string of mules from Colombia.

489
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:23,300
You do good on that, there'll be some other things.

490
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,680
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

491
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,392
You want a cigar?

492
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,813
You wanna dance, Frank,

493
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,649
or sit here and have a heart attack?

494
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:47,741
Who? Me, dance? I want a heart attack instead.

495
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,037
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

496
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,586
How about you?

497
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,010
What? You want me to dance?

498
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,095
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony. You dance.

499
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,348
Go on. Have some fun.

500
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,030
What do you think of him?

501
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,407
I think he's a fucking peasant!

502
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,456
But you get a guy like that on your side,

503
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,250
he breaks his back for you.

504
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,363
What's your name?

505
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,490
What?

506
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,285
What's your name? Elvira what?

507
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,578
Hancock.

508
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,746
What?

509
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,122
Hancock!

510
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,415
Hancock?

511
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,087
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.

512
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,922
Flying around.

513
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,342
Where you from?

514
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,260
Baltimore.

515
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,345
What?

516
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,347
Baltimore! Baltimore?

517
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,807
Where's that?

518
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,601
It doesn't really matter, okay?

519
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,355
I'm just trying to be friendly.

520
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,690
I don't need another friend,

521
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,110
especially one who just got off a banana boat.

522
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,446
Banana boat?

523
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,323
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.

524
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,283
I don't come off no banana boat.

525
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,371
You're thinking of someone else, maybe.

526
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,873
Aren't you part of the Cuban crime wave?

527
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,336
What you talking crazy for? I'm a political refugee here.

528
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,088
So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.

529
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,464
Sorry.

530
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,051
I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.

531
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,887
What is your problem, baby?

532
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,222
You're good-looking.

533
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,391
You got a beautiful body, beautiful legs,

534
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,977
a beautiful face, all these guys in love with you.

535
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,562
Only you got a look in your eye

536
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,356
like you haven't been fucked in a year!

537
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,942
Hey, José.

538
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,320
Who, why, when and how I fuck is none of your business, okay?

539
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,822
Now you're talking to me, baby.

540
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,657
That I like. Keep it coming.

541
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,869
Don't call me "baby"! I'm not your baby.

542
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,080
Not yet, but you gotta give me some time.

543
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,752
Even if I were blind, desperate,

544
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,172
starved and begging for it on a desert island,

545
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,591
you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck.

546
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,929
That chick he's with...

547
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,182
Yeah? ...she likes me.

548
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,270
She likes you? How do you know?

549
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,771
I know.

550
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,401
The eyes, chico. They never lie.

551
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,990
Are you serious?

552
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,783
Serious? What do you think?

553
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,369
That's the boss's lady, okay?

554
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,537
You're gonna get us killed.

555
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,749
Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.

556
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,460
That guy's soft.

557
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,088
Look in his face.

558
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,761
The booze and the concha tell him what to do.

559
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,724
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

560
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,227
Just remember last year at this time

561
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,479
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

562
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,980
You remember.

563
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,775
I'd like to forget that.

564
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,611
I say be happy with what you got.

565
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,071
You be happy.

566
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,407
Me, I want what's coming to me.

567
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,992
What's coming to you?

568
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,622
The world, chico,

569
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,000
and everything in it.

570
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,586
Oh, man.

571
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,162
This is paradise.

572
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,958
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

573
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:52,713
This town's like a great big pussy just waiting to get fucked.

574
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,633
I should've come here 10 years ago.

575
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,553
I'd have been a millionaire by this time.

576
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,557
By this time, I'd have had my own boat,

577
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,059
my own car, my own golf course.

578
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,062
You know what I want? I thought of this the other day.

579
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,814
A line of blue jeans.

580
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,067
With my name written on the back of chicks' asses.

581
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:16,862
How's that?

582
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,990
That sounds completely crazy to me.

583
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,076
Look at that. Look.

584
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:25,829
You're missing the sights. That's what you're doing.

585
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,205
We're missing the action.

586
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,836
Want to have some ice cream with my friend and me?

587
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,755
Get lost, greaseball!

588
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,591
Look at that. Ice cream?

589
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,426
That's right. You said "ice cream"?

590
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,552
Girls like ice cream.

591
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,763
Oh, come on. That won't work.

592
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,765
You can't do it that way.

593
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,768
You know how you pick up chicks in this country?

594
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,815
What was that? What you just did?

595
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,108
That's what you do.

596
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,985
That's disgusting.

597
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,028
Watch.

598
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,947
Look at that fucking thing. You look like a lizard.

599
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,283
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.

600
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,370
Figures you wouldn't understand.

601
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,621
But the women in this country,

602
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,706
when you do that, they know.

603
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,749
They know what?

604
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,751
They understand. They go crazy.

605
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,213
It'll take practice, but you gotta learn.

606
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,465
'Cause women love when you suck the pussy.

607
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,800
Look at that.

608
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,057
She's looking at us.

609
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,145
You think you can do it with her?

610
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,438
I think I can.

611
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,065
You want to try it with her?

612
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,316
Why not?

613
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,027
You gonna watch me?

614
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,821
I'm looking at you. Go ahead.

615
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,572
You won't do it. Watch this.

616
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,450
I'm with you, man.

617
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,619
I'm gonna get her.

618
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,916
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.

619
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,418
Just be quiet. Just hang back.

620
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,794
Romeo!

621
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,760
You're looking very pretty today.

622
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,345
Yes, you. I've been watching you.

623
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,597
You want to see something funny?

624
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,850
Take a look over there. See that man?

625
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,352
Watch that guy. I gotta sit down here.

626
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:13,770
I gotta watch my friend.

627
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,523
He gonna stick his tongue out to that girl.

628
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,024
Oh, look at that.

629
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,110
You're sick!

630
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,446
You see what happened to him?

631
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:24,781
If I wasn't a nice guy...

632
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,491
She's too big for you.

633
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,535
Causing trouble like that, come on.

634
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,037
Bitch! Lesbian! What I try to tell you?

635
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,539
What I try to tell you?

636
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,542
This country, you gotta make the money first.

637
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,796
Then when you get the money, you get the power.

638
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:43,049
Then when you get the power, then you get the women.

639
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,969
That's why you gotta make your own moves.

640
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,721
That's the one I rented.

641
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:52,058
No. That's her, man. There she is.

642
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,727
About time.

643
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,147
Frank got held up at the golf course.

644
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,815
He told me to pick you up.

645
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,068
He said he'd meet us at the track later.

646
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,366
He said to bet on Ice Cream in the first, by the way.

647
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:13,205
In that thing? You must be kidding.

648
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,043
What you talking about? That's a Cadillac.

649
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,755
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

650
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,923
Oh, come on.

651
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:28,386
It's got a few years, but it's a cream puff.

652
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,556
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

653
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,401
So, you like this better?

654
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,278
Yeah.

655
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,615
It's like one of them tigers from India.

656
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,867
Tigers, huh? Tigers, no?

657
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,869
Crazy guy. Know what he's been doing?

658
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,789
Dragging me to the zoo to look at tigers.

659
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,624
He says he's gonna buy one.

660
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,293
You do that and you won't have any friends left.

661
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,711
Not that you have any now.

662
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,547
You're gonna like that tiger, man.

663
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,550
You gonna drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat?

664
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:09,135
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

665
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:13,723
How much?

666
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:15,308
43,000, fully equipped.

667
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,018
That all?

668
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,812
Machine-gun turrets are extra.

669
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,982
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.

670
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,319
Bulletproof this, okay?

671
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,488
And this here and here.

672
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,991
- Okay. - And the windows.

673
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,746
Get me a phone with a scrambler.

674
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,081
A scrambler.

675
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,667
And a radio with scanners

676
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,752
to pick up flying saucers, stuff like that.

677
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,504
Don't forget the fog lights.

678
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:48,508
Oh. In case I get caught in a swamp. That's a good idea.

679
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,598
Get out of the way, lady! I'm trying to drive here!

680
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,351
I thought you were taking me to Frank.

681
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,484
We got an hour. You hungry?

682
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,988
No, but I'm bored.

683
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:12,699
Well, that figures.

684
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:18,163
Check it out, Manny, okay? And pay the guy.

685
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,666
And you take a taxi. Meet me at the track, okay?

686
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,543
Good doing business with you. Mr. Montana.

687
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,379
Oh, God, man!

688
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,384
I wouldn't buy the car if you didn't like it.

689
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,220
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you, Tony?

690
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:36,556
Oh, yeah. You know who?

691
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,477
What would Frank say?

692
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,564
I like Frank, you know?

693
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,900
Only I like you better.

694
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:55,909
You got some for me?

695
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,077
Sure.

696
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:05,919
Okay.

697
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,551
Okay.

698
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,014
Don't get confused, Tony.

699
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,183
I don't fuck around with the help.

700
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,569
You wanna play that way with me, I play with you.

701
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:32,904
Shit.

702
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,281
Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?

703
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:36,449
No!

704
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,078
Playtime is over, okay?

705
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,749
Okay.

706
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,429
Mama?

707
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:42,432
Antonio.

708
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,017
Long time.

709
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,605
No postcards from jail, huh?

710
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,617
Gina.

711
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,787
Tony?

712
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,205
Look at you.

713
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,666
You're beautiful.

714
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,376
I didn't...

715
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,128
Mama, look at those eyes, huh.

716
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,963
Look at that. She looks like me.

717
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,218
You know the last time I saw you, you was like that.

718
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:21,805
You looked like a little boy. Now look at you.

719
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,061
I got something for you.

720
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,026
It's no big deal.

721
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,029
Oh, Tony!

722
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,918
I never thought I'd see you again, you know?

723
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,170
You think they'd keep a guy like me down?

724
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,755
Well, no.

725
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,719
You look so good.

726
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:05,014
Look, open that up. Open it.

727
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,808
For me?

728
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,934
I think so.

729
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,564
It's nothing much, you know, nothing.

730
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,028
See what's written on the back?

731
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,406
On the back? Aw.

732
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,366
Always.

733
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,286
"Always." It's beautiful, Tony!

734
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,956
Mama is still working in the factory,

735
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,208
and I work part-time in a beauty parlor.

736
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,378
I'm doing hair, Tony. Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

737
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,381
His father owned that barbershop. It's his place.

738
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,092
Plus I go to junior college. Miami Dade.

739
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,304
In two more years, I get my cosmetology license.

740
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,264
Then I'll be making enough money...

741
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,640
Surprise!

742
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,977
All that's over, starting today.

743
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:52,478
Why?

744
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,397
My kid sister don't have to work

745
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,233
in no beauty parlor, and Mama,

746
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,278
she don't have to sew in no factory.

747
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,655
Your son made it, Mama.

748
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,450
He's a success.

749
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,995
That's why I didn't come around before.

750
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:13,833
I want you to see what a good boy I've been.

751
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,754
Here's $1,000.

752
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,964
For you, Mama.

753
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,265
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

754
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,475
Mama.

755
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,810
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

756
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,854
- No? - No.

757
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,857
What are you doing now?

758
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,527
Banks, or is it still bodegas, you and the others?

759
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,863
No! Things are different now.

760
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,783
I'm working with an anti-Castro group.

761
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,785
I'm an organizer now.

762
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,162
I get a lot of political contributions.

763
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,706
Sure you do.

764
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:01,130
A gun sticking in somebody's face is how.

765
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,760
You know, all we hear about in the papers

766
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,556
is animals like you and the killings.

767
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,560
It's Cubans like you who are giving a bad name to our people,

768
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,312
people who come here, work hard

769
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,981
and make a good name for themselves.

770
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,024
People who send their children to school.

771
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:21,818
What are you saying? That's your son...

772
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,988
Son? I wish I had one.

773
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:26,823
He's a bum. No.

774
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,784
He was a bum then and he's a bum now.

775
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,579
Who do you think you are?

776
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,581
Mmm?

777
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,085
We haven't heard a word from you in five years.

778
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,882
You suddenly show up here, throw some money around

779
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,427
and think you can get my respect.

780
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,763
You think you can buy me with jewelry?

781
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:54,434
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes

782
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,020
and your jail manners and make fun of us?

783
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,022
You don't know what you're saying.

784
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,274
That's not the way I am, Antonio!

785
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,943
That is not the way I raised Gina to be!

786
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:08,531
You are not going to destroy her.

787
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,951
I don't need your money.

788
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,872
I work for my living.

789
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:19,000
I don't want you in this house anymore!

790
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,461
I don't want you around Gina.

791
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:25,048
So come on. Get out!

792
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,221
Okay.

793
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,851
Mama...

794
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,938
And take this lousy money with you. It stinks.

795
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,315
Tony.

796
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,486
Why do you have to spoil it for everybody, huh?

797
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,823
I'm sorry, Tony.

798
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,910
Okay, Mama.

799
00:56:58,207 --> 00:56:59,707
No. Tony, wait a minute!

800
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,875
Don't go, please!

801
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,001
Gina, stay here!

802
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,252
No, Mama.

803
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,337
He's no good. Gina!

804
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,507
Tony, wait, please!

805
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,218
I'm sorry. I don't know.

806
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,553
Mama, ever since Papa left, she's...

807
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,847
Forget Papa. We never had one.

808
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,558
I know you did some bad things back then.

809
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,520
In the Army, I know you got into some trouble.

810
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,355
The Communists,

811
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,524
they're always trying to tell you what to do.

812
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,150
Mama doesn't understand that.

813
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:27,443
I know.

814
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,656
I just... I don't know.

815
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,367
I just want you to know that I don't care.

816
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,910
It doesn't matter to me how long

817
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,538
you've been away, five or ten years.

818
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,793
You're my blood, always.

819
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,547
I know.

820
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,641
Come on. I want you to take this.

821
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,809
I gotta go back in.

822
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,185
No, Tony. Please.

823
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,645
You need this.

824
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,063
What will I tell her?

825
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:05,898
Take that. You don't tell her anything.

826
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,316
Don't tell her I gave it to you,

827
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,527
but give her some from time to time.

828
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,238
And listen, you go out yourself.

829
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,741
Go ahead. Go out, do some things. Have some fun.

830
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,077
You gotta get some fun out of life.

831
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,997
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?

832
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,583
A pussycat like you? Come here.

833
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,881
I'll talk to you again. Okay.

834
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,091
Put that money away. Don't let her see it.

835
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,676
I'll talk to her.

836
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,013
I'll talk to you. Okay.

837
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,224
Let's go.

838
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,519
She's beautiful. How come you...

839
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:44,854
Hey!

840
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:51,360
Stay away from her. You hear?

841
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,696
She's not for you.

842
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,822
Okay.

843
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,099
So, this and my other factory,

844
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,392
I can guarantee production

845
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,563
of 200 kilos refined every month of the year.

846
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,233
The problem is, I have no steady market.

847
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:33,736
Basically, what I'm looking for is somebody in the States

848
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,030
who can share the risk with me,

849
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,240
somebody who can guarantee

850
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:41,494
to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.

851
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:46,249
Oh, that's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa. Something like that...

852
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,669
Too bad Frank's not here. You should talk to him.

853
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,671
It would've been nice if he'd come.

854
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:52,838
He would like to come,

855
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:55,091
but with his trial coming up,

856
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,510
it's hard to leave the country.

857
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,428
So he sent you instead?

858
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,013
Something like that.

859
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,349
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

860
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:07,353
You got good stuff here. Class-A shit.

861
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,962
This Lopez guarantees to buy 150 kilos from me

862
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,380
every month of the year.

863
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,631
He picks it up here.

864
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,009
I can sell it to him for as little as

865
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:43,389
7,000 a key. You can't do better than that.

866
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:47,059
But then we got to take the risk of moving it.

867
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:50,229
We'll be cutting out the Colombians. Know what that means?

868
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,231
That means we have to go to war with them.

869
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,901
We cut out the Colombians, we take risks on both sides.

870
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,862
Why don't we split the risk?

871
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:03,075
You guarantee your delivery, say, as far as Panama,

872
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,661
we take it from there.

873
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,417
Panama is risky. It costs me more.

874
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:17,340
Panama I can sell for 13.5 a key.

875
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,093
13.5? What, are you nuts?

876
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:26,349
13.5? We still got to take that shit to Florida.

877
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,517
Do you know what that's like these days?

878
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,728
You got the Navy everywhere.

879
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,855
You got frogmen.

880
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,232
You got EC2s with the satellite-tracking shit.

881
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:39,111
You got the fucking Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.

882
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,114
We're losing one out of every nine loads.

883
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:45,951
That's no duckwalk anymore, let me tell you.

884
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,620
Forget about 13.5.

885
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,959
What do you suggest that is reasonable?

886
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,592
Excuse me. One moment.

887
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,391
What the fuck's the matter with you?

888
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,142
Are you negotiating for Frank Lopez?

889
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,478
Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

890
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,606
I'm not worried about it. You should worry about it.

891
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,984
If he wants to make a deal, it's up to him, not you.

892
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:20,653
We're doing this one deal. That's it.

893
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,655
Fuck you. How's that?

894
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,574
Fuck you. Fuck you.

895
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,411
You need to open your eyes and keep your mouth shut.

896
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,954
That's it. Let it go at that.

897
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,414
Don't worry about it.

898
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:33,457
Your head's in the wrong place.

899
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,834
You must watch out for yourself.

900
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:36,085
Why not talk to him?

901
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,170
You think he wants to give you the money?

902
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,672
Shut the fuck up.

903
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,841
I'm doing the talking here, not you.

904
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,344
You're here to watch my back. Watch my back.

905
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,764
Better than your front, let me tell you.

906
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,349
That's easier to watch.

907
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,851
Close your mouth.

908
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:55,479
I can't wait to see what Frank's gonna react to this one.

909
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,649
Just shut up. I'm doing the talking here.

910
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,110
Now where were we?

911
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,361
Panama.

912
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,030
You're looking for a partner, right?

913
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,950
Something like that.

914
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,537
Look, Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

915
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:16,750
I am down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it.

916
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,961
That's my limit. I got no right.

917
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,254
Nobody got no right to negotiate...

918
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,131
Let the man finish, okay?

919
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,925
Let him propose a proposition, then we can talk more.

920
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,011
You got no authority here.

921
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,889
I started you in this business, so shut the fuck up.

922
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,433
Frank is gonna love it.

923
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,018
That's up to Frank, not you!

924
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,607
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

925
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,609
No, it is all right.

926
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,404
You're right. Maybe you should talk to Frank.

927
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,408
Well, good.

928
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,913
I don't think it's something I want to do on an overseas phone.

929
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:57,166
But as soon as I get back to Miami,

930
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,084
I will talk to Frank personally.

931
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,253
Good.

932
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,423
My associates can escort you to my chopper

933
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,217
to take you to Santa Cruz.

934
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,386
I have a jet there. You'll be in Miami in five hours.

935
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,473
You'll be back here tomorrow in time for lunch.

936
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,518
Good.

937
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,606
Good talking to you.

938
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,776
Why not leave your friend here?

939
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,654
While you're gone, he can tell me how to run my business.

940
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,447
I think Frank wants to see him.

941
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,823
No, that's okay.

942
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:33,619
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him.

943
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,915
I guess so.

944
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,003
Let's finish our lunch.

945
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,718
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

946
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,347
You got everything a man could want.

947
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,102
I like you, Tony. There is no lying in you.

948
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,480
Unfortunately, I don't feel the same

949
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,857
about the rest of your organization.

950
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,655
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

951
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,741
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

952
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,956
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch

953
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,293
from several years ago in New York.

954
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,716
He was an informer for the police.

955
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:50,863
He put Vito Duval and Nello and Gino Ramos away for life.

956
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,287
So how do I know you're not a chivato, too, Tony?

957
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,708
Hey, Sosa.

958
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:07,588
Let's get this straight now.

959
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,469
I've never fucked anybody over who didn't have it coming.

960
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,095
You got that?

961
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:19,850
All I have in this world is my balls and my word.

962
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,354
I don't break them for no one, you understand?

963
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,107
That piece of shit up there, I never liked him,

964
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:28,692
I never trusted him.

965
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,903
For all I know, he had me set up

966
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,364
and had my friend Angel Fernandez killed.

967
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,866
But that's history. I'm here, he's not.

968
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,327
You want to go on with me, say it.

969
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,163
You don't, then you make a move.

970
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,505
I think you speak from the heart, Montana.

971
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,006
But I say to myself,

972
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,093
"This Lopez, your boss,

973
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:58,013
"he had chivatos like that working for him."

974
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,557
His judgment stinks.

975
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,062
So I think to myself,

976
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,482
"How many other mistakes has this Lopez guy made?

977
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,863
"How can I trust his organization? " You tell me, Tony.

978
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,077
Frank is smart, you know?

979
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,790
You can't blame him for that animal.

980
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,794
It's a crazy business we're in, you know?

981
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,630
That could happen to anyone, even you.

982
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,973
Why don't I go back and talk to Frank

983
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,434
and work it out?

984
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,270
I'll fix things between us.

985
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,815
You got my word on that.

986
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:54,319
I think you and me, we can work this thing out,

987
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,364
we do business together a long time.

988
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,701
Just remember,

989
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,871
I'll only tell you one time,

990
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:07,040
don't fuck me, Tony.

991
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,670
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

992
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,810
You what?

993
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:32,524
You made a deal for fucking $18 million

994
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,942
without even checking with me?

995
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,111
Are you crazy, Montana? Are you crazy?

996
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,988
Coño. Take it easy. Coño, my ass!

997
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:41,200
At 10.5 a key, it's puro.

998
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,078
You can't lose money. No way.

999
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,584
We make 75 million on this deal.

1000
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,629
75 million.

1001
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,673
That is serious money.

1002
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,801
What is Sosa going to do

1003
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,178
when I don't come up with the first 5 million?

1004
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,056
What is he going to do? Will he send me a bill?

1005
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,475
He'll send a hit squad up here!

1006
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,601
There'll be a war in the street.

1007
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:11,438
Relax! Take it easy. I'm in tight with Sosa.

1008
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:16,401
You short a couple of mil, I go on the street for you.

1009
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,445
I make a couple of moves,

1010
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,532
a mil here, a mil there, you got it.

1011
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,409
Okay?

1012
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,623
You've been making moves on your own?

1013
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,837
I got ears, you know. I hear things.

1014
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,552
What do you hear about Echevierra and the Diaz brothers?

1015
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,846
What about Gomez?

1016
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,265
What'll he do when you start moving 2,000 keys...

1017
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:50,269
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and fuck the Diaz brothers!

1018
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,603
Fuck them all!

1019
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,690
I'll bury those cockroaches!

1020
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,026
What they ever do for us?

1021
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,829
Look, Frank, the time has come.

1022
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,999
We gotta expand.

1023
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,669
The whole operation. Distribution.

1024
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,007
New York, Chicago, LA.

1025
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:24,553
We gotta set our own mark and enforce it.

1026
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,139
We gotta think big now.

1027
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,020
Think big.

1028
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,736
Like your friend Sosa.

1029
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,491
Let me tell you something about that greaseball cocksucker.

1030
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:49,661
He is a snake, that's what he is.

1031
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:55,417
You turn your back on him, he'll stick it in.

1032
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,337
You don't trust a guy like that.

1033
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,090
You want me to believe

1034
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,887
Omar was a stoolie because Sosa said so?

1035
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,931
You bought that line?

1036
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:13,060
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there.

1037
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,731
Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know.

1038
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,655
Like what?

1039
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,408
You tell me, "Like what."

1040
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:35,165
You calling me a liar, Frank?

1041
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,960
That what you're calling me?

1042
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:45,592
Let's just say I want things

1043
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:47,719
to stay the way they are for now.

1044
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,642
You stall your deal with Sosa.

1045
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,645
Stall it?

1046
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:02,567
Okay, boss.

1047
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:04,277
Come on.

1048
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:07,990
I am the boss.

1049
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,534
Sure, you're the boss.

1050
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:11,785
Hey, Tony.

1051
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,750
Remember I told you when you started,

1052
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,420
the guys who last in this business

1053
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,506
are the guys who fly straight,

1054
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,300
low-key, quiet.

1055
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,637
And the guys who want it all,

1056
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,641
chicas, champagne, flash,

1057
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,061
they don't last.

1058
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,856
You finished?

1059
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:42,983
Can I go now?

1060
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,007
Hi, there.

1061
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,974
You just missed Frank.

1062
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,270
Too bad.

1063
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,733
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

1064
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:29,196
This is not the time or the place, Tony.

1065
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,156
Next time, make an appointment.

1066
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,282
That's okay.

1067
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,494
I got something important I want to talk to you about.

1068
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,003
So why don't we have a couple of drinks,

1069
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:46,838
act normal,

1070
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,967
and just take it easy?

1071
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:53,678
Come on. I like Scotch.

1072
01:13:58,601 --> 01:13:59,976
Sure. Why not?

1073
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,853
Okay. I won't bite you.

1074
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:06,525
We're all normal here.

1075
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,990
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.

1076
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,700
That's right.

1077
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,541
I think it's easier, don't you?

1078
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,001
Makes things easier.

1079
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:28,672
Thank you.

1080
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,134
Here's to the land of opportunity.

1081
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,636
For you, maybe.

1082
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,892
You like kids?

1083
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:43,854
Kids?

1084
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,731
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.

1085
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,569
Sure. Why not?

1086
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,487
As long as there's a nurse.

1087
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:55,532
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

1088
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,580
I like them. Boys, girls. Don't matter to me.

1089
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,043
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

1090
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:09,045
Come here.

1091
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,095
Sit here.

1092
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,431
I want to talk to you. Sit down.

1093
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,266
I'm not gonna bite you.

1094
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,065
Okay, here's the story.

1095
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,530
I come from the gutter. I know that.

1096
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,953
I got no education, but that's okay.

1097
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:45,457
I know the street,

1098
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,043
and I'm making all the right connections.

1099
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:52,714
With the right woman, there's no stopping me.

1100
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,592
I could go right to the top.

1101
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,806
Anyway, what I got to tell you is this,

1102
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,560
I like you.

1103
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,650
I liked you the first time I laid eyes on you.

1104
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,572
I said, "She's a tiger.

1105
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,826
"She'll belong to me."

1106
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,249
Anyway,

1107
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,335
I want you to marry me.

1108
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,341
I want you to be the mother of my children.

1109
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:42,180
Me? Marry you?

1110
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,515
That's right.

1111
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,021
What about Frank, Tony?

1112
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,274
What will you do about Frank?

1113
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,944
Frank is not gonna last, okay? He's finished.

1114
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,865
Just think about it, okay?

1115
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,536
I want you to really think about it.

1116
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,166
I'll go now. Take care.

1117
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,510
All your enemies are gone.

1118
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:23,263
Mr. Montana. How are you?

1119
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,556
Hello.

1120
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,274
What the fuck she doing here?

1121
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,901
- Come on, man. - She's just dancing.

1122
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,737
Come on. Take it easy.

1123
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,127
It's just a disco.

1124
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,420
Who's that guy she's with?

1125
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,007
He's some guy who works for Luco. He's nobody.

1126
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,800
He's harmless. Works for Luco?

1127
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,345
Yeah. Forget him.

1128
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:09,184
Hello, Tony. You remember me?

1129
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:15,482
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?

1130
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:18,485
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

1131
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,072
That's right, yeah. I think we should talk.

1132
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,367
Talk? What are we going to talk about?

1133
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,912
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

1134
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,122
No, not lately.

1135
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:34,959
What about ancient history, like Emilio Rebenga?

1136
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:38,213
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?

1137
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:41,925
Whoever's giving you your information

1138
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,718
is taking you for a long ride.

1139
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,220
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

1140
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,680
Tony, baby, we gonna talk,

1141
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:50,683
or am I gonna bust your wiseass spic balls

1142
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,143
here and now?

1143
01:18:58,025 --> 01:18:59,609
Keep your eye on her.

1144
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,195
- I'll do that. - Okay.

1145
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,949
My office. Good.

1146
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:17,335
The word on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.

1147
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,088
That means you're not a small-time punk anymore,

1148
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,048
you're public property now.

1149
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:24,968
Supreme Court says that your privacy can be invaded.

1150
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,803
Okay. How much?

1151
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,722
How much?

1152
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,892
There's an answer to that, too.

1153
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:40,859
Here's how much.

1154
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,403
Can you see it?

1155
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,323
Big number. Yeah!

1156
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,410
That's on a monthly basis, same thing every month.

1157
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,579
You know how this works?

1158
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,915
No. You tell me.

1159
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,918
We tell you who's moving against you,

1160
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,088
and we shake down who you want shaken down.

1161
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:06,301
Let's say that you got a real problem making a collection.

1162
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,596
And then we step in for you.

1163
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:12,348
Got eight killers with badges working for me.

1164
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:13,725
When they hit, it hurts.

1165
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,518
Same thing works the other way.

1166
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:17,687
You feed me a bust now and then.

1167
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,316
Some cowboy setting himself up in business.

1168
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,235
Small fry, you know?

1169
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,657
We like snacks.

1170
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:33,286
How do I know you're the last cop I'm gonna have to grease?

1171
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:38,708
What about Fort Lauderdale? Metro? DEA?

1172
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:42,462
How do I know what rock they're gonna crawl out from under?

1173
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,381
Well, that's not my business, Tony.

1174
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:46,758
We don't cross no lines.

1175
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,845
You think I want this conversation

1176
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,722
going any farther than this table?

1177
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:56,434
My guys' got families. They're legitimate cops.

1178
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,728
I don't want to see them embarrassed.

1179
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,688
If they're embarrassed, they'll suffer.

1180
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,483
If they suffer, they'll make you suffer.

1181
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,446
You understand what I'm talking about?

1182
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,114
Huh?

1183
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,792
Thanks for the drink.

1184
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,129
By the way,

1185
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,174
I got a vacation coming up.

1186
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:30,885
I'm gonna take the wife to London, England.

1187
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:32,428
We've never been there.

1188
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:35,807
So throw in a couple of round-trip tickets, first class.

1189
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,942
You gotta smile more, Tony. You gotta enjoy yourself.

1190
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,987
Every day above ground is a good day.

1191
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,835
Hello.

1192
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,338
Yeah. Now that's the idea.

1193
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,215
Okay, Mel.

1194
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,511
You think about what I said?

1195
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:15,346
About the kids?

1196
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:19,475
You know, you are really nuts.

1197
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,227
I'm nuts about you.

1198
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,439
Why don't you find your own girl?

1199
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:25,857
My own girl? Yeah.

1200
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,066
That's what I'm doing.

1201
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,985
Go do it somewhere else. Get lost.

1202
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,362
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes.

1203
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,740
You won't hear anything if you go on like this.

1204
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,033
Will you do something?

1205
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,869
You're fucking right I'm going to do something!

1206
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,080
I'm giving you orders. Blow!

1207
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:44,876
Orders? You giving me orders?

1208
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,800
The only thing in this world

1209
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:56,554
that gives orders is balls. You got that?

1210
01:22:58,057 --> 01:22:59,265
Balls.

1211
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:10,902
Let's go.

1212
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:19,827
Elvira.

1213
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,082
When you gonna learn? Huh?

1214
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,462
Looking good, honey. Keep up the bad work.

1215
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,256
That cocksucker.

1216
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:33,383
What happened?

1217
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:36,928
He put that prick Bernstein on me.

1218
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,096
Who? Lopez did?

1219
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:40,682
How do you know?

1220
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:43,267
Who else knew about Rebenga? Omar?

1221
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,520
He's fertilizer.

1222
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,606
He's letting me know he's got weight on me.

1223
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,403
I'll tell you what, man.

1224
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,447
You know our little trip we've been planning to New York?

1225
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,282
It might be a good time.

1226
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:17,301
Wait. Where you going?

1227
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,829
Welcome to my private room.

1228
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:46,247
Your private room.

1229
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,623
This is my private room.

1230
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:51,377
I got a beautiful, nice, white lounge chair for you.

1231
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,885
Gina, you taste so muy bueno.

1232
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:03,765
Tony!

1233
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,225
What are you doing? Shut up!

1234
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,603
What? We wasn't doing nothing!

1235
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,021
Fernando, wait!

1236
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,689
Get out!

1237
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,860
Damn you!

1238
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,695
You think he's cute?

1239
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:20,239
I saw him putting his hand all over your ass.

1240
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,200
My kid sister in a toilet.

1241
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,534
It's none of your business.

1242
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,037
None of my business? The fuck it ain't!

1243
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,288
You can't tell me what to do!

1244
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,456
I am telling you!

1245
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,541
Listen to me. Come here.

1246
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:35,421
I catch you here again,

1247
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:37,131
I'm gonna wipe you all over the fucking place.

1248
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:40,134
Yeah? Go ahead! Do it now. I want to see it.

1249
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:41,344
I want to see it now, big shot.

1250
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:42,512
Don't push me.

1251
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:43,763
I want to see it now!

1252
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,140
Don't push me! Get outta here!

1253
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,934
Go outside.

1254
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,977
You got some nerve, Tony!

1255
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:53,105
You think you can tell me what to do?

1256
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:54,982
You can't tell me what to do.

1257
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,192
I'm not a baby anymore.

1258
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:59,153
I'll do what I want to do, see whoever I want to see.

1259
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:02,323
And if I want to fuck them, then I'll fuck them!

1260
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:06,619
Fucking, man! Come on, man.

1261
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:14,001
What the fuck you want? You want something? Huh?

1262
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:16,587
No. Don't touch me.

1263
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,424
No. We've got to get out of here.

1264
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:24,428
Not there. I don't want to go out there.

1265
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,431
Another great night here at the Babylon, right?

1266
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,475
Okay. All right!

1267
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,435
Do another gram, you'll all be babbling on.

1268
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:36,148
Is that coke in your bra, or are you just glad to see me?

1269
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,276
A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.

1270
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,487
I'm in a good mood. I was depressed when I got up this morning.

1271
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:44,490
I had a dry dream, but I'm better now.

1272
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,757
I do Laurel and Hardy in Spanish, too.

1273
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,846
That's the height of culture, I assure you.

1274
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,515
But my favorite Cuban of all time has to be Ricky Ricardo.

1275
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,727
Mr. Babalu himself.

1276
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:14,645
He had the same problem for 10 years.

1277
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,398
"Lucy, don't come down to the club."

1278
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:52,433
He's your brother. He loves you. That's why he did it.

1279
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,602
All right? He cares about you.

1280
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,271
To him, you're still his little sister.

1281
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:00,816
That's the problem. He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1282
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:02,443
I'm 20 years old now.

1283
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:03,945
I'm not anybody's baby.

1284
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:05,404
You're so grown-up.

1285
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,535
Come on, Gina. Put yourself in his place, okay?

1286
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:15,289
Right now, you happen to be the best thing in his life,

1287
01:28:15,374 --> 01:28:19,293
the only thing that's any good, that's pure.

1288
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:23,130
Of course he doesn't want you mixing with those people,

1289
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,548
growing up to be like him.

1290
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,635
He has this father thing for you.

1291
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,220
Feels like he has to protect you.

1292
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,055
Protect me against what?

1293
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,599
Against guys like that asshole

1294
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:34,976
you were dancing with tonight.

1295
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:39,146
I like Fernando. He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1296
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,651
And he knows how to treat a woman. All right?

1297
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:45,736
He knows how to treat a woman? Yes.

1298
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,905
By taking her to the toilet to make out?

1299
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,157
You've been a great audience.

1300
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:52,076
I got a special treat for you.

1301
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,744
Here's a guy I found in the jungle

1302
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:54,954
from Caracas, Venezuela.

1303
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,664
He's unlike anything you've seen.

1304
01:28:56,748 --> 01:29:00,376
Give a warm Babylon welcome to the one and only Octavio!

1305
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,195
Look around. Go out with someone

1306
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,280
who has something on the ball,

1307
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,865
who's going somewhere in life.

1308
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,074
Like who?

1309
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,120
For instance, someone who's got a real job, like a banker.

1310
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,830
Or... Or a doctor, a lawyer...

1311
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,123
What about you?

1312
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,085
What are you talking about?

1313
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,712
Why don't you take me out?

1314
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,714
Are you crazy?

1315
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,799
I see the way you look at me, Manolo.

1316
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,593
Do you think I'm blind? I see.

1317
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:51,927
Come on.

1318
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,305
What? Look, Gina,

1319
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,476
Tony and I are like brothers, all right?

1320
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,478
You're his kid sister.

1321
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,229
So what? That's where it ends.

1322
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,148
That's where it stays.

1323
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,150
Are you afraid of Tony, huh?

1324
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:08,402
You afraid of Tony's kid sister?

1325
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:10,571
I'm not afraid of anybody!

1326
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,823
That's not the point here!

1327
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,585
Oh, fuck.

1328
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,380
It's not for me. Don't look at me.

1329
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,216
How do you know?

1330
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,550
'Cause I'm not here.

1331
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,510
Oh, really? Then where are you?

1332
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:43,057
Shit, you're weird.

1333
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:44,266
I'm weird?

1334
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:45,476
Hello?

1335
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,602
Hello, Miriam?

1336
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:47,978
Tony!

1337
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,897
Put Manny on, okay?

1338
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:51,315
Okay. Just a second.

1339
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:52,942
It's Tony.

1340
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,197
What are you doing, checking up on me?

1341
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:00,115
Get your clothes on and meet me

1342
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,117
in front of Lopez Motors in 45 minutes.

1343
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,495
What? What happened?

1344
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,121
Nothing we can't fix.

1345
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:09,124
All right. I'll be there.

1346
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,835
You're still on the phone. Let's go.

1347
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,045
Take it easy, okay?

1348
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:16,006
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1349
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,217
Nick? Yeah, Tony.

1350
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:20,636
This is what I want you to do for me,

1351
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:23,847
you call Lopez.

1352
01:33:24,349 --> 01:33:28,018
Call him at his office at 3:00 sharp.

1353
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,855
And you tell him,

1354
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:35,150
"We fucked up, he got away."

1355
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:36,944
Okay. Yeah.

1356
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,362
Got it? What are you going to say?

1357
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,364
"We fucked up. He got away."

1358
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,867
What time? 3:00 sharp.

1359
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:48,872
So when are we gonna make some money on this thing?

1360
01:33:48,999 --> 01:33:51,959
Six months to start don't mean shit, Larry.

1361
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,796
I'm not a Rockefeller, you know. Not yet, anyway.

1362
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,174
So you owe me.

1363
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:02,886
Listen, go down to the ball game tonight?

1364
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:04,972
I couldn't make it. I got things.

1365
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,640
I'll tell you about them.

1366
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:10,894
You're kidding. What was the score? Three to two?

1367
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,480
Mel, guess what.

1368
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,399
My Little League team, the Little Lopezers,

1369
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,234
they won the division tonight.

1370
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,695
That's great. Congratulations.

1371
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,906
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

1372
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:28,412
Jesus Christ.

1373
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,249
Tony, what happened to you?

1374
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:38,047
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

1375
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,216
Who the fuck did this?

1376
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:44,511
Hitters. I don't know.

1377
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,765
Somebody must've brought them in.

1378
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,225
I've never seen them before.

1379
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,019
Hello, Mel.

1380
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,189
Got an answer to this, too?

1381
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:57,566
There always is, Tony.

1382
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:59,610
I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

1383
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:02,529
They got a beef going back to the Sun Ray thing.

1384
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,743
Maybe you're right, you know?

1385
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:12,748
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

1386
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,877
We'll return the favor for you in spades.

1387
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:19,755
I'll take care of this myself.

1388
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:27,471
What is the gun for, Tony?

1389
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,141
What, this? It's nothing.

1390
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:37,106
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.

1391
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,330
You gonna answer, Frank?

1392
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:59,169
It must be Elvira. She got mad after we left the club.

1393
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,258
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?

1394
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:08,178
No, it's all right. I'll talk to her.

1395
01:36:16,146 --> 01:36:17,354
Hello.

1396
01:36:24,154 --> 01:36:27,614
It's all right. I'm gonna be home in an hour. Don't worry.

1397
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:33,829
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

1398
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:36,165
What are you talking about?

1399
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,583
You know what I'm talking about,

1400
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:40,169
you fucking cockroach.

1401
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:43,213
What are you talking about? Listen to me, huh.

1402
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:45,549
You know what a chazer is, Frank?

1403
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:49,553
That's a pig that don't fly straight.

1404
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,264
Neither do you, Frank.

1405
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,685
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?

1406
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,729
I brought you in.

1407
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:01,398
So we had a few differences, no big deal.

1408
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:05,652
I gave you your start. I was the one who believed in you.

1409
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,905
I stayed loyal to you.

1410
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,909
I made what I could on the side,

1411
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,702
but I never turned on you, Frank!

1412
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,412
Never!

1413
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:20,375
But you,

1414
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:28,425
a man who ain't got his word is a cockroach.

1415
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:34,765
Mel. Do something, will you?

1416
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:41,772
It's your tree, Frank. You're sitting in it.

1417
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:52,783
All right, Tony. I was the one.

1418
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:01,959
Please, give me a second chance.

1419
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:06,630
Will you do that? Please?

1420
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:15,222
Give me a second chance. I'll give you $10 million.

1421
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,017
Okay? $10 million.

1422
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,854
I got it in a vault over there in Spain, Tony.

1423
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:27,526
We go over there, we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1424
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:31,530
Okay? All of it. $10 million.

1425
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,615
Okay, Tony?

1426
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:36,702
Huh?

1427
01:38:37,704 --> 01:38:39,037
Please, Tony?

1428
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:44,042
Elvira? You want Elvira?

1429
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:47,879
You can have her. I'll go away. I'm gonna disappear.

1430
01:38:48,006 --> 01:38:49,840
You'll never see me again.

1431
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,550
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

1432
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:53,635
I never did nothing to nobody.

1433
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:56,680
No, you never did nothing to nobody.

1434
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:58,890
You had somebody else do it for you.

1435
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:00,309
Oh, Tony, I'm begging you.

1436
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,019
Get up! Get up now!

1437
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:04,187
- Jesus! - No! God!

1438
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:12,863
Look. Tony, no! Don't kill me, please.

1439
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:17,242
I won't kill you.

1440
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,911
Oh, Christ, thank you. Get off my foot.

1441
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,496
Thank you.

1442
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:23,707
Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

1443
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:25,375
No, no!

1444
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,127
No!

1445
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:48,565
Every dog has his day, huh, Mel?

1446
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:49,900
I told him

1447
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:53,278
it didn't make any sense

1448
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:57,240
clipping you when we had you working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1449
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:01,870
He got hot tonight about the broad.

1450
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,415
He fucked up.

1451
01:40:06,209 --> 01:40:09,920
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.

1452
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,798
Don't go too far, Tony.

1453
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:17,177
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1454
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,939
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

1455
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:32,025
Whoever says you was one?

1456
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:33,652
Wait a minute!

1457
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,948
You let me go. I'll fix this up.

1458
01:40:38,449 --> 01:40:42,536
Sure, Mel. Maybe you can handle yourself

1459
01:40:42,954 --> 01:40:46,289
one of them first-class tickets to the Resurrection.

1460
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,460
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!

1461
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,880
So long, Mel. Have a good trip.

1462
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:55,006
Fuck you!

1463
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,390
Okay, come on.

1464
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,016
What about Ernie?

1465
01:41:15,153 --> 01:41:16,820
You want a job, Ernie?

1466
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:21,658
Sure, Tony.

1467
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:23,535
Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

1468
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:26,079
Man, you got a job!

1469
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:29,833
Tony! Thanks.

1470
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:00,864
Tony.

1471
01:42:05,077 --> 01:42:06,912
God, what's happened?

1472
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,582
Where's Frank?

1473
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,085
Where do you think?

1474
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:22,886
Come on. Get your stuff.

1475
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:24,930
You're coming with me.

1476
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:05,460
So you come to me with some kind of thing. Okay.

1477
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:07,545
You propose it, I talk to you.

1478
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:11,299
But we got a problem. I can't pay more.

1479
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:15,428
I'm bringing in twice as much as I ever did before.

1480
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:19,015
We're doing 10 million, 15 million a month. Come on.

1481
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:21,226
That's serious money.

1482
01:47:21,519 --> 01:47:23,311
You bank boys gotta come down a bit.

1483
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:24,437
No way.

1484
01:47:24,522 --> 01:47:26,773
That's crazy. We can't do that.

1485
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,316
Then that's too bad.

1486
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,568
What am I gonna do?

1487
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:31,903
We're not a wholesale operation.

1488
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:35,657
We're a legitimate bank. The more cash you give me,

1489
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:37,992
the harder it is for me to rinse.

1490
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:40,370
That's a problem. I didn't know.

1491
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:43,373
The fact is, I can't take any more of your money

1492
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,792
unless I raise the rates on you.

1493
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,254
You gonna raise the... I gotta do it.

1494
01:47:49,338 --> 01:47:50,505
The IRS is coming...

1495
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:53,258
Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.

1496
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:54,384
I'm talking.

1497
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:56,970
I go low, you go high. I know the game.

1498
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:58,221
This is business talk.

1499
01:47:58,305 --> 01:47:59,597
Let me explain something.

1500
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:02,142
The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida.

1501
01:48:02,226 --> 01:48:04,644
There was a TIME magazine story that didn't help.

1502
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,187
There's a recession.

1503
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,606
I got stockholders I got to be responsible for.

1504
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:09,816
I got to do it, Tony.

1505
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,109
You'll learn from him.

1506
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:14,571
I got to go 10% on the first 12 million in denominations of 20.

1507
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,656
I'll go 8% on your $10 bills,

1508
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:17,782
6% on your fives.

1509
01:48:17,867 --> 01:48:19,659
We'll go somewhere else. That's it.

1510
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,911
There's no place else to go.

1511
01:48:21,996 --> 01:48:23,288
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1512
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:26,374
I'll fly the cash myself to the Bahamas.

1513
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:29,252
Once, maybe. Then what?

1514
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:32,172
You'll trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank

1515
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:34,340
with 20 million of your hard-earned dollars?

1516
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,259
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.

1517
01:48:36,635 --> 01:48:37,927
Who else can you trust?

1518
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:40,805
That's why you pay us so much. You trust us.

1519
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:42,724
Huh?

1520
01:48:45,603 --> 01:48:47,353
Did you hear that guy?

1521
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,398
You got to listen to him. You'll learn something.

1522
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:51,691
Stay with us.

1523
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:54,861
You're a well-liked customer. You're in good hands with us.

1524
01:48:57,281 --> 01:48:58,448
And I got to run.

1525
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,657
I'm safe but poor.

1526
01:49:01,076 --> 01:49:03,036
How's married life treating you?

1527
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,204
Better than you are.

1528
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:08,917
Say hello to the princess for me. She's beautiful.

1529
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:11,544
I'll see you. Take care.

1530
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:12,712
You, too.

1531
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:27,560
That prick!

1532
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:30,813
Fucking WASP whore.

1533
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:35,068
Talking to me like I'm some maricón who came over on a boat.

1534
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:40,073
I tell you what. We don't need that smiling motherfucker.

1535
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:43,660
We should talk to this Jewish guy, Seidelbaum, okay?

1536
01:49:43,994 --> 01:49:47,956
He's got his own exchange. He charges 4% at the most.

1537
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:50,208
And he's connected.

1538
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:55,672
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.

1539
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:58,466
I don't trust them.

1540
01:50:17,778 --> 01:50:20,613
Did you sweep the house this month? The cars?

1541
01:50:21,073 --> 01:50:24,701
Yeah, I told you about it. The $5,000?

1542
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:27,453
Look at that.

1543
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:28,705
What?

1544
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:30,915
That cable truck there.

1545
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,918
Since when does it take three days to rig a cable?

1546
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:38,798
What? You been watching it for three days?

1547
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:43,011
The thing has been there for three days.

1548
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:44,887
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

1549
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,140
What, you think it's cops, right?

1550
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:48,349
I don't know.

1551
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:51,853
Could be the Diaz brothers, coming to get me.

1552
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:56,607
Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?

1553
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,775
You check it out.

1554
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:01,362
Then we're gonna blow that fucking truck back to Colombia!

1555
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:05,992
Come on. We're not the only dopers living on the block.

1556
01:51:06,076 --> 01:51:07,410
Okay? Remember that.

1557
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:10,496
That truck could be anybody and anything.

1558
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:11,956
It could be a cable company...

1559
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:14,375
You know something? You got some fucking attitude.

1560
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:17,128
For someone who's in charge of my security...

1561
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:20,590
Here are the keys to the front door.

1562
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:22,550
Go down there. Give them the keys!

1563
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:24,344
I'm just trying to say something.

1564
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:27,472
You're spending a lot of money on this counter-surveillance.

1565
01:51:27,556 --> 01:51:28,681
I don't give a fuck.

1566
01:51:28,766 --> 01:51:31,392
It's 12% of our adjusted gross.

1567
01:51:31,477 --> 01:51:32,685
12% isn't peanuts.

1568
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:33,936
I don't give a fuck!

1569
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:36,481
It makes me sleep good at night. That's what counts.

1570
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:37,815
Okay? You worry about it.

1571
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:38,941
I am worried about it.

1572
01:51:39,026 --> 01:51:41,778
I'm telling you. We're getting sloppy.

1573
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,865
Our thinking, our fucking attitude, you know?

1574
01:51:46,075 --> 01:51:47,867
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

1575
01:51:48,452 --> 01:51:50,578
Miami's changing. You can see it everywhere.

1576
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:52,580
New construction. New jobs.

1577
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:55,625
Growth that's financed by Florida Security Trust.

1578
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:58,336
We've put your money to work for 75 years,

1579
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,463
building a more prosperous Miami.

1580
01:52:00,881 --> 01:52:02,924
Count on us being here tomorrow.

1581
01:52:03,008 --> 01:52:06,177
That's because for 75 years, you been fucking everybody.

1582
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:10,139
Somebody should do something about those whores.

1583
01:52:10,474 --> 01:52:13,059
I mean, charging me 10 points on my money.

1584
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:15,436
They're getting away with it.

1585
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:16,938
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1586
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:18,481
Forget it. Anything goes.

1587
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:20,441
They been around 1,000 years.

1588
01:52:20,526 --> 01:52:22,652
They got all the angles figured out.

1589
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:26,155
You know what capitalism is? Getting fucked.

1590
01:52:26,281 --> 01:52:28,408
True capitalist if ever I met one.

1591
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:30,201
Uh-oh.

1592
01:52:30,285 --> 01:52:32,036
Did you hear that?

1593
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:35,331
How would you know, bubblehead?

1594
01:52:36,041 --> 01:52:38,626
You ever do nothing besides get your hair fixed

1595
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:39,961
and powder your nose?

1596
01:52:40,129 --> 01:52:42,672
Look at you. You do too much of that shit.

1597
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:44,882
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1598
01:52:45,342 --> 01:52:47,760
You should know that, Tony.

1599
01:52:47,845 --> 01:52:48,886
I should know what?

1600
01:52:50,139 --> 01:52:51,639
What should I know?

1601
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:54,392
Why do you have to talk to me like that all the time,

1602
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:55,935
like I got to know something?

1603
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:57,395
Let me talk to you.

1604
01:52:57,688 --> 01:52:59,021
Listen. What time is it?

1605
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:00,398
This Seidelbaum...

1606
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:02,024
6:55.

1607
01:53:02,192 --> 01:53:03,276
Okay.

1608
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,569
I met with this guy Seidelbaum...

1609
01:53:04,653 --> 01:53:08,114
The drug-related violence that's plagued South Florida...

1610
01:53:08,574 --> 01:53:10,867
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1611
01:53:10,951 --> 01:53:15,163
With a small law-enforcement budget, how can you put a dent

1612
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:19,834
on an estimated $100-billion-a-year business?

1613
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,420
It seems at times all you can do

1614
01:53:22,504 --> 01:53:24,547
is put your finger in the dike and pray.

1615
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:26,466
Put your fingers in a dyke?

1616
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,051
The only place you can get your fingers

1617
01:53:29,136 --> 01:53:30,511
is in some dyke.

1618
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:33,556
...Not by outlawing the substances,

1619
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:36,142
but by legalizing and taxing them.

1620
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:41,606
These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element.

1621
01:53:42,274 --> 01:53:44,442
I am not one of those voices.

1622
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:46,235
I know that. But you know why?

1623
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:49,155
'Cause you got your head up your culo, that's why.

1624
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:51,574
That fucking guy, he never tells the truth.

1625
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:54,744
...Splendor of our city at its best.

1626
01:53:55,037 --> 01:53:56,704
It's those guys, man!

1627
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,956
It's the fucking bankers, the politicians,

1628
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:01,292
they're the ones that wanna make coke illegal

1629
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:03,044
so they can make the fucking money

1630
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:04,795
and then get the fucking votes!

1631
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,090
They fighting the bad guys. They're the bad guys!

1632
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:10,259
They fuck anything and anyone.

1633
01:54:10,344 --> 01:54:13,429
Can't you stop saying "fuck" all the time?

1634
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:16,265
Can't you stop talking about money? It's boring, Tony.

1635
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:20,394
Where's this coming from? Boring? What's boring?

1636
01:54:20,521 --> 01:54:22,104
You're boring. Oh.

1637
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:25,816
"Money. " That's all I hear in this house.

1638
01:54:26,068 --> 01:54:29,070
Look at these pelicans fly. Come on, pelicans!

1639
01:54:29,154 --> 01:54:30,196
Here it is.

1640
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,822
Frank never talked about money.

1641
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:38,663
That's 'cause he was so smart.

1642
01:54:45,921 --> 01:54:47,588
You know what you're becoming?

1643
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:51,092
You're an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking...

1644
01:54:51,176 --> 01:54:54,554
Who the fuck you calling a "spic ," you white piece of bread?

1645
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:56,138
Get out of the way of the TV!

1646
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,975
Dig a hole in the garden, bury it, and forget about it.

1647
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:02,478
I work hard for this! I want you to know that.

1648
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,776
Somebody should've given it to you.

1649
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,319
You would've been a nicer person.

1650
01:55:12,447 --> 01:55:14,490
Know what your problem is, pussycat?

1651
01:55:14,575 --> 01:55:16,158
What is my problem?

1652
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:19,412
You got nothing to do with your life.

1653
01:55:20,539 --> 01:55:23,291
Why don't you get a job or something?

1654
01:55:23,792 --> 01:55:25,710
Do something. Be a nurse.

1655
01:55:26,545 --> 01:55:29,422
Work with blind kids, lepers. That kind of thing.

1656
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:33,009
Anything beats lying around all day

1657
01:55:33,093 --> 01:55:34,594
waiting for me to fuck you!

1658
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:37,722
Don't toot your horn, honey. You're not that good.

1659
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:39,932
No? Frank was better?

1660
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:42,727
You're an asshole!

1661
01:55:43,604 --> 01:55:45,563
Where you going? Come here!

1662
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:48,482
Elvie!

1663
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:50,526
I was kidding!

1664
01:55:52,029 --> 01:55:53,571
I was only kidding!

1665
01:55:53,655 --> 01:55:55,948
I guess sometimes married life

1666
01:55:56,033 --> 01:55:57,908
is not all it's cracked up to be.

1667
01:55:58,118 --> 01:55:59,577
Where you going?

1668
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:00,661
I got a date.

1669
01:56:01,538 --> 01:56:03,164
You got a date? Come here. Yeah.

1670
01:56:08,295 --> 01:56:10,379
What?

1671
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:11,505
This Seidelbaum thing.

1672
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:13,799
Yeah, it's all set up.

1673
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:16,177
Yeah, well, you forget it.

1674
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:18,262
Stay out of it. I'll take care of it.

1675
01:56:18,347 --> 01:56:21,098
Stay out of it? It's my deal. I set it up.

1676
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:23,768
You're not a negotiator, Manny, you know that.

1677
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:26,270
You like the ladies more than the money.

1678
01:56:26,355 --> 01:56:27,396
That's your problem.

1679
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:30,399
What the fuck are you talking about? I'm your partner, okay?

1680
01:56:30,484 --> 01:56:32,902
If you don't trust me with that kind of thing,

1681
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:34,528
who're you gonna trust?

1682
01:56:34,613 --> 01:56:35,863
Junior partner.

1683
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:38,407
Bullshit, man.

1684
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,868
Don't talk to me about trust, I don't like it.

1685
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:44,038
You should listen to your wife. She's right.

1686
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:45,831
You are an asshole, man!

1687
01:56:46,792 --> 01:56:49,126
Come here. Give me a kiss. Come here.

1688
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:51,796
Fuck you, man!

1689
01:56:52,881 --> 01:56:56,384
Who put this thing together? Me! That's who!

1690
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:59,762
Who do I trust? Me!

1691
01:57:00,389 --> 01:57:02,431
Fuck him. "Trust."

1692
01:57:05,227 --> 01:57:08,312
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.

1693
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:10,606
I need that shit.

1694
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:13,776
I don't need him.

1695
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:18,614
I don't need her. Fuck them. I don't need nobody.

1696
01:57:20,117 --> 01:57:22,326
Back then I worked in pictures down in Colombia.

1697
01:57:22,411 --> 01:57:25,162
I was in that movie Burn. You ever see it?

1698
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:27,832
You saw me with Marlon Brando?

1699
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:28,999
You know, we're good friends.

1700
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:30,292
I was his driver.

1701
01:57:30,377 --> 01:57:31,502
No shit?

1702
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:32,712
Brando.

1703
01:57:32,796 --> 01:57:35,673
They shot it there. Cartagena.

1704
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:37,967
Gillo Pontecorvo. He was the director.

1705
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:39,176
Italian guy.

1706
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:41,095
Tell me about him.

1707
01:57:41,179 --> 01:57:42,972
I also know Paul Newman.

1708
01:57:43,432 --> 01:57:44,432
I worked with him in Tucson.

1709
01:57:44,516 --> 01:57:45,516
No kidding?

1710
01:57:45,642 --> 01:57:48,477
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

1711
01:57:48,562 --> 01:57:50,521
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?

1712
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:51,897
Subtotal.

1713
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:53,315
No?

1714
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:57,445
He's a nice guy.

1715
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:01,991
$283, 107.65.

1716
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:06,829
You want a company check here?

1717
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:12,209
I got 284.6.

1718
01:58:12,335 --> 01:58:14,170
That's just not possible.

1719
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:15,796
The machine don't make mistakes.

1720
01:58:19,342 --> 01:58:20,426
Let's count it again.

1721
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,510
No. Come on.

1722
01:58:21,636 --> 01:58:23,429
Business is business. Come on.

1723
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,014
You're talking $1,500 here.

1724
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:29,185
Okay, you keep the change. Okay? I don't give a shit.

1725
01:58:30,979 --> 01:58:31,979
I'll count it again for you.

1726
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:33,230
No, come on.

1727
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:36,150
This check here, where does this check go?

1728
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:40,946
Montana Realty Company.

1729
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,031
Montana what?

1730
01:58:42,491 --> 01:58:47,995
Montana Realty Company.

1731
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:49,830
That's 284.

1732
01:58:49,915 --> 01:58:51,874
284,600.

1733
01:58:52,834 --> 01:58:55,336
How come you don't know Benny Alvarez?

1734
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:57,630
Me and Benny have lunch together.

1735
01:58:57,714 --> 01:58:59,882
He probably knows me.

1736
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:02,009
You ask him.

1737
01:59:20,028 --> 01:59:21,570
We're up to what?

1738
01:59:23,114 --> 01:59:29,245
Seven checks. $1,325,623.

1739
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,083
200,000 more.

1740
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:35,292
We ought to take a leak.

1741
01:59:35,377 --> 01:59:36,377
Freeze!

1742
01:59:36,461 --> 01:59:37,795
Get your hands up!

1743
01:59:37,921 --> 01:59:39,463
Go against the wall, turn around.

1744
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:40,589
You're not kidding.

1745
01:59:40,715 --> 01:59:43,884
You're under arrest for violation of the RICO Statute.

1746
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:45,636
You have the right to remain silent.

1747
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:48,305
Anything you say can and will be taken against you.

1748
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:50,140
How do I know you guys are cops?

1749
01:59:50,225 --> 01:59:51,892
What's that say, asshole?

1750
01:59:53,311 --> 01:59:56,313
That's pretty good, man. Where'd you get that?

1751
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:57,857
You call yourself a Cuban?

1752
01:59:57,941 --> 01:59:59,775
You make a real Cuban throw up!

1753
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:02,069
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

1754
02:00:02,445 --> 02:00:03,779
I want to call my lawyer.

1755
02:00:03,864 --> 02:00:05,614
Lot of good he's gonna do you.

1756
02:00:05,782 --> 02:00:07,992
You see that eye there in the clock?

1757
02:00:08,326 --> 02:00:10,286
Say, "Hi, honey."

1758
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:13,372
That's pretty cute. Look at that.

1759
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:15,666
You jerk off in front of us, Seidelbaum?

1760
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:18,085
I was supposed to meet this chick at 3:00.

1761
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:20,004
You're a fucking pain in the ass.

1762
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:22,131
All right, Benny, kill it.

1763
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,676
You understand the rights I've given you?

1764
02:00:25,844 --> 02:00:28,012
I know all that bullshit, Seidelbaum!

1765
02:00:28,138 --> 02:00:29,471
Save your breath.

1766
02:00:29,806 --> 02:00:32,516
You got nothing on me. You know it. I know it.

1767
02:00:33,018 --> 02:00:35,352
I'm changing dollar bills, that's all.

1768
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:39,148
You want to waste my time? Okay. I call my lawyer.

1769
02:00:39,816 --> 02:00:43,694
He's the best lawyer in Miami. He's such a good lawyer

1770
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:48,073
that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska.

1771
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:51,160
So dress warm.

1772
02:00:55,206 --> 02:00:59,293
Give me a check for 100 grand, plus 300 in cash.

1773
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:02,588
I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge.

1774
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:06,508
They're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion,

1775
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:09,386
and they'll get it.

1776
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:15,684
So, what am I looking at here?

1777
02:01:17,938 --> 02:01:20,147
Five years. You'll be out in three.

1778
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:22,900
Maybe less, if I can make a deal.

1779
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:26,070
Three fucking years!

1780
02:01:28,448 --> 02:01:29,740
For what?

1781
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,660
Washing money?

1782
02:01:32,744 --> 02:01:34,286
The fucking country was built on washed money.

1783
02:01:34,371 --> 02:01:35,746
Can't be that bad.

1784
02:01:35,872 --> 02:01:36,956
It's not like Cuba.

1785
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,290
What the fuck you talking?

1786
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:40,125
The jails are like hotels.

1787
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:41,585
You kidding me or what?

1788
02:01:41,711 --> 02:01:43,128
You fucking high or what?

1789
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:44,546
I'll delay the trial.

1790
02:01:44,756 --> 02:01:47,841
A year and a half, two years. You won't even start...

1791
02:01:47,926 --> 02:01:49,093
Fuck you, man!

1792
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:51,178
I'm not going back in any cage, okay?

1793
02:01:51,262 --> 02:01:53,097
No way. I been there.

1794
02:01:58,728 --> 02:02:00,104
Okay, look.

1795
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:06,652
I give you $400,000 more. Okay, now that's $800,000.

1796
02:02:07,112 --> 02:02:10,280
With that kind of money, you can buy the Supreme Court.

1797
02:02:12,909 --> 02:02:16,412
Tony, the law has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.

1798
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:19,748
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.

1799
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:21,500
But when you got 1.3 million

1800
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:24,837
undeclared staring into a videotape camera,

1801
02:02:25,505 --> 02:02:27,840
honey baby, it's hard to convince a jury

1802
02:02:27,924 --> 02:02:29,508
you found it in a taxicab.

1803
02:02:53,116 --> 02:02:55,659
I'm so glad you could come on such short notice.

1804
02:02:55,785 --> 02:02:56,869
I really appreciate it.

1805
02:02:56,953 --> 02:02:58,662
It's okay. How's Elvira?

1806
02:02:58,955 --> 02:03:00,873
Oh, great. How's your wife?

1807
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:02,041
Three more months.

1808
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:03,375
Oh, yeah? Congratulations.

1809
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:04,626
How about you?

1810
02:03:04,711 --> 02:03:07,421
When you gonna have another Tony to take your place?

1811
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:08,589
I'm working on it.

1812
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:10,507
You have to work harder. Come.

1813
02:03:10,675 --> 02:03:13,052
I want you to meet some of my friends.

1814
02:03:17,974 --> 02:03:19,266
This is Pedro Quinn,

1815
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:21,351
chairman of the Andes Sugar Corporation.

1816
02:03:21,478 --> 02:03:22,770
Pleasure meeting you.

1817
02:03:22,854 --> 02:03:23,937
Nice to meet you.

1818
02:03:24,022 --> 02:03:27,399
General Edward Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps.

1819
02:03:28,902 --> 02:03:30,110
Pleasure.

1820
02:03:30,195 --> 02:03:32,237
This is Ariel Bleyer,

1821
02:03:32,363 --> 02:03:35,324
with the Ministry of the Interior. Tony Montana.

1822
02:03:37,494 --> 02:03:41,413
And here is our friend Charles Goodson from Washington.

1823
02:03:41,706 --> 02:03:42,748
Nice to meet you.

1824
02:03:42,832 --> 02:03:44,333
How do you do, Mr. Montana?

1825
02:03:45,376 --> 02:03:46,877
Sit here, Tony.

1826
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:51,924
Gentlemen.

1827
02:03:55,845 --> 02:03:57,763
I would like to discuss something

1828
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,848
that is of interest to all of us here.

1829
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:02,893
You have a problem, Tony.

1830
02:04:03,728 --> 02:04:06,939
We have a problem.

1831
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:10,859
I think together we can solve all our problems.

1832
02:04:13,113 --> 02:04:15,656
We all know you have tax troubles in your country

1833
02:04:15,740 --> 02:04:18,450
and that you may have to do a little time.

1834
02:04:19,077 --> 02:04:20,661
We have friends in Washington

1835
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:23,831
that assure us these troubles can be taken care of.

1836
02:04:23,915 --> 02:04:27,459
You may have to pay some back taxes, a big fine,

1837
02:04:28,253 --> 02:04:30,379
but there will be no prison.

1838
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:32,047
Okay.

1839
02:04:32,966 --> 02:04:34,925
So what's your problem, Alex?

1840
02:04:35,969 --> 02:04:37,761
I'll show you my problem.

1841
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:41,473
I've heard about financial support your government receives

1842
02:04:41,558 --> 02:04:43,392
from the drug industry in Bolivia.

1843
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:46,770
Well, the irony of this is that this money,

1844
02:04:46,896 --> 02:04:48,397
which is in the billions,

1845
02:04:48,606 --> 02:04:50,357
is coming from your country.

1846
02:04:50,441 --> 02:04:54,278
You are the major purchaser of our national product,

1847
02:04:54,404 --> 02:04:56,155
which is cocaine.

1848
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:58,490
On one hand, you're saying the U. S. Government

1849
02:04:58,575 --> 02:05:00,701
is spending millions to eliminate

1850
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:02,911
the flow of drugs onto our streets.

1851
02:05:03,163 --> 02:05:04,788
At the same time,

1852
02:05:04,914 --> 02:05:07,749
we are doing business with the same government

1853
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:10,502
that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

1854
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:13,422
Let me show you a few of the other characters

1855
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:15,757
that are involved in this tragic comedy.

1856
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:18,260
My organization just recently traced

1857
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:21,138
a large purchase by this man.

1858
02:05:21,806 --> 02:05:25,434
This charming face here belongs to General Cucombre.

1859
02:05:25,685 --> 02:05:28,937
He is the Minister of the Defense of Bolivia, my country.

1860
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:31,857
And General Cucombre just a couple months ago

1861
02:05:31,941 --> 02:05:36,778
bought a $12 million villa on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.

1862
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,530
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be

1863
02:05:38,615 --> 02:05:39,740
the Bolivian Defense Minister,

1864
02:05:39,824 --> 02:05:42,075
what is he doing living in Switzerland?

1865
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,660
Guarding cash registers?

1866
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:47,748
This man here, Alejandro Sosa,

1867
02:05:47,832 --> 02:05:49,124
a very interesting character.

1868
02:05:49,334 --> 02:05:51,001
He's a wealthy landowner,

1869
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:53,670
educated in England, very good family.

1870
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:57,966
But this man is the business brain and drug overlord

1871
02:05:58,218 --> 02:06:00,969
of an empire that stretches across the Andes.

1872
02:06:01,054 --> 02:06:03,639
He's not your ordinary drug dealer.

1873
02:06:04,182 --> 02:06:06,225
Well, discussing it openly...

1874
02:06:07,977 --> 02:06:10,395
He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.

1875
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:16,526
He is going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television.

1876
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:20,030
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.

1877
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:22,199
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1878
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:26,703
That is our problem.

1879
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:31,583
You remember Alberto, don't you?

1880
02:06:32,919 --> 02:06:34,628
How could I forget him?

1881
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:38,715
Alberto is an expert in the disposal business.

1882
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:42,094
He's going to help us fix our problem.

1883
02:06:43,888 --> 02:06:45,847
But he doesn't speak English.

1884
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:49,601
He doesn't know his way around the States too well.

1885
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:51,812
He needs a little help.

1886
02:06:54,023 --> 02:06:55,941
Is that a problem, Tony?

1887
02:07:01,864 --> 02:07:03,490
No problem.

1888
02:07:06,035 --> 02:07:07,160
Good.

1889
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:26,471
So what's the big mystery with the Bolivian situation?

1890
02:07:26,848 --> 02:07:29,850
You gonna tell me what happened with Sosa, or what?

1891
02:07:30,059 --> 02:07:33,353
A lot of bullshit, that's what happened.

1892
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,397
Politics.

1893
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:43,488
I want you to stay down here for a while.

1894
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:46,408
Run things for me.

1895
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,328
I gotta go to New York next week.

1896
02:07:55,668 --> 02:07:56,918
Fuck this, man.

1897
02:07:57,045 --> 02:07:59,921
I don't like it, man. I don't like this at all.

1898
02:08:00,048 --> 02:08:01,715
You don't like it?

1899
02:08:04,761 --> 02:08:08,013
You got me into this mess in the first place.

1900
02:08:08,097 --> 02:08:11,850
With that fucking Seidelbaum, that right?

1901
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:13,268
With Seidelbaum?

1902
02:08:13,394 --> 02:08:15,604
What does Seidelbaum have to do with Sosa?

1903
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:18,440
How do you connect those two?

1904
02:08:18,858 --> 02:08:21,443
Why don't you eat your food? What's wrong with it?

1905
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:23,612
I'm not hungry.

1906
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:25,364
You're not hungry?

1907
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:27,282
Do you even know about the trial?

1908
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:29,159
What did you order it for, then?

1909
02:08:29,243 --> 02:08:31,578
I lost my appetite.

1910
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:38,293
Do you even know that Sheffield said

1911
02:08:38,378 --> 02:08:40,545
he can get you a postponement?

1912
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:52,099
Is this it? That's what it's all about?

1913
02:08:55,311 --> 02:08:58,730
Eating, drinking,

1914
02:08:59,232 --> 02:09:01,400
fucking, sucking...

1915
02:09:01,484 --> 02:09:02,818
Come on, man.

1916
02:09:02,902 --> 02:09:04,236
Snorting?

1917
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:05,487
Then what?

1918
02:09:07,156 --> 02:09:08,990
Tell me. Then what?

1919
02:09:09,951 --> 02:09:14,454
You're 50. You got a bag for a belly.

1920
02:09:15,832 --> 02:09:18,625
You got tits, you need a bra.

1921
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,002
They got hair on them.

1922
02:09:22,255 --> 02:09:25,590
You got a liver, and they got spots on it

1923
02:09:25,675 --> 02:09:27,759
and you're eating this fucking shit

1924
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:31,805
and you're looking like these rich fucking mummies in here.

1925
02:09:32,014 --> 02:09:34,683
Come on. It's not so bad. It could be worse.

1926
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:36,685
Is this what it's all about?

1927
02:09:36,769 --> 02:09:37,853
Forget it.

1928
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:41,022
This what I work for? Tell me.

1929
02:09:46,612 --> 02:09:47,863
Look at that.

1930
02:09:48,948 --> 02:09:50,282
A junkie.

1931
02:09:52,034 --> 02:09:56,413
I got a fucking junkie for a wife. She don't eat nothing.

1932
02:09:57,582 --> 02:10:01,376
Sleeps all day with them black shades on.

1933
02:10:03,045 --> 02:10:04,337
Wakes up with a Quaalude...

1934
02:10:04,422 --> 02:10:05,714
Don't pick on her, man.

1935
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:09,551
...And who won't fuck me 'cause she's in a coma.

1936
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:13,638
I can't even have a kid with her.

1937
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:16,433
Her womb is so polluted,

1938
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:19,519
I can't even have a fucking little baby with her!

1939
02:10:19,604 --> 02:10:21,938
You son of a bitch!

1940
02:10:22,899 --> 02:10:24,566
You fuck!

1941
02:10:24,901 --> 02:10:26,318
You shouldn't talk like that.

1942
02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:28,612
How dare you talk to me like that!

1943
02:10:29,906 --> 02:10:32,282
What makes you so much better than me?

1944
02:10:32,742 --> 02:10:34,034
What do you do? Don't worry.

1945
02:10:34,118 --> 02:10:36,369
You deal drugs and you kill people.

1946
02:10:36,454 --> 02:10:37,746
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.

1947
02:10:38,414 --> 02:10:40,749
Real contribution to human history.

1948
02:10:40,875 --> 02:10:42,250
Go ahead. Tell everybody.

1949
02:10:42,335 --> 02:10:43,668
You want a kid?

1950
02:10:43,753 --> 02:10:45,086
Tell the world.

1951
02:10:45,213 --> 02:10:48,089
What kind of a father would you make?

1952
02:10:49,425 --> 02:10:51,885
Gonna drive him to school in the mornings?

1953
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:55,597
Are you even gonna be alive by the time the kid goes to school?

1954
02:10:57,099 --> 02:10:58,975
You don't know how to be a husband!

1955
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:00,060
Sit down before I...

1956
02:11:00,144 --> 02:11:02,646
Do we ever go anywhere without having 600 thugs

1957
02:11:02,772 --> 02:11:04,439
hanging around all the time?

1958
02:11:04,815 --> 02:11:08,568
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

1959
02:11:10,071 --> 02:11:13,073
What kind of life is that?

1960
02:11:17,495 --> 02:11:18,954
Can't you see

1961
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:24,000
what we're becoming, Tony? We're losers.

1962
02:11:24,961 --> 02:11:27,254
We're not winners, we're losers.

1963
02:11:28,256 --> 02:11:30,006
Go home. You're stoned.

1964
02:11:30,091 --> 02:11:32,300
I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

1965
02:11:32,593 --> 02:11:33,677
Get her out of here.

1966
02:11:33,761 --> 02:11:34,970
Come on.

1967
02:11:37,348 --> 02:11:39,266
I'm not going home with you.

1968
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:42,811
I'm not going home with anybody.

1969
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:46,189
I'm going home alone.

1970
02:11:51,862 --> 02:11:53,196
I'm leaving you.

1971
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:57,701
I don't need this shit anymore.

1972
02:11:58,202 --> 02:11:59,995
Okay, but I'll walk you out.

1973
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:01,288
I'll take her home in a cab.

1974
02:12:01,372 --> 02:12:03,623
Let her go.

1975
02:12:04,208 --> 02:12:07,043
Another Quaalude, she gonna love me again.

1976
02:12:14,594 --> 02:12:16,177
What're you looking at?

1977
02:12:23,144 --> 02:12:25,520
You're all a bunch of fucking assholes.

1978
02:12:26,856 --> 02:12:28,356
You know why?

1979
02:12:30,234 --> 02:12:33,486
You don't have the guts to be what you want to be.

1980
02:12:37,033 --> 02:12:39,367
You need people like me.

1981
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:46,583
You need people like me

1982
02:12:46,667 --> 02:12:49,377
so you can point your fucking fingers

1983
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,255
and say, "That's the bad guy."

1984
02:12:55,217 --> 02:12:58,970
So, what does that make you?

1985
02:12:59,597 --> 02:13:00,639
Good?

1986
02:13:03,517 --> 02:13:05,268
You're not good.

1987
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,397
You just know how to hide,

1988
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:12,400
how to lie.

1989
02:13:15,071 --> 02:13:18,490
Me, I don't have that problem.

1990
02:13:20,201 --> 02:13:23,411
Me, I always tell the truth.

1991
02:13:25,122 --> 02:13:26,831
Even when I lie.

1992
02:13:36,008 --> 02:13:38,551
So say good night to the bad guy!

1993
02:13:39,178 --> 02:13:40,428
Come on.

1994
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:45,517
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again,

1995
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:46,976
let me tell you.

1996
02:13:48,187 --> 02:13:51,564
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

1997
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:55,527
There's a bad guy coming through!

1998
02:13:56,278 --> 02:13:57,946
Better get out of his way!

1999
02:15:25,451 --> 02:15:29,162
No. You tell Sheffield to keep his nose out of it.

2000
02:15:29,371 --> 02:15:30,705
There's gonna be no trial.

2001
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:32,707
I got it all under control now.

2002
02:15:33,125 --> 02:15:35,210
Just tell him to stay out of it!

2003
02:15:35,753 --> 02:15:38,171
Okay, what about Elvira? Did she call?

2004
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:42,967
Yeah, all right.

2005
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,151
Tony, everything go okay?

2006
02:16:00,486 --> 02:16:02,278
Yeah, everything is roses.

2007
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:07,992
Ernie, what time do you got?

2008
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,162
Ten to.

2009
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:12,497
Where is this guy, man?

2010
02:16:12,581 --> 02:16:13,832
I gotta call Manny again.

2011
02:16:15,417 --> 02:16:16,960
You don't tell me what to do here!

2012
02:16:17,044 --> 02:16:18,044
He's coming out.

2013
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:19,295
He's coming.

2014
02:16:20,631 --> 02:16:21,798
I don't give a fuck.

2015
02:16:21,882 --> 02:16:23,007
It's him, man.

2016
02:16:30,516 --> 02:16:32,725
I don't care where you blow him up.

2017
02:16:33,352 --> 02:16:34,853
Tell me when, okay?

2018
02:16:36,647 --> 02:16:39,482
You just tell me when. That's all I care about.

2019
02:16:49,702 --> 02:16:51,828
I heard you the first time.

2020
02:16:51,912 --> 02:16:54,205
One time. That's all you gotta tell me.

2021
02:16:58,085 --> 02:17:00,336
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

2022
02:17:02,965 --> 02:17:04,716
- Look. - Here he comes.

2023
02:17:07,636 --> 02:17:09,721
Where's he going?

2024
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:11,639
What's he doing that way?

2025
02:17:23,027 --> 02:17:24,694
What the fuck he doing?

2026
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,585
What the fuck is that? Come here.

2027
02:17:40,669 --> 02:17:42,754
You said she took the kids in the other car!

2028
02:17:42,838 --> 02:17:45,173
She did, every fucking day.

2029
02:17:45,257 --> 02:17:46,716
I don't know what's going on.

2030
02:17:49,136 --> 02:17:52,972
No fucking way. No fucking way. That's it!

2031
02:18:05,611 --> 02:18:07,570
This fucking guy.

2032
02:18:44,817 --> 02:18:46,818
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

2033
02:18:50,948 --> 02:18:54,993
Two little kids in the car. This is so fucking bad.

2034
02:18:55,828 --> 02:18:57,829
This is so fucking bad.

2035
02:19:01,709 --> 02:19:03,793
I see them, all right? I see them!

2036
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:11,092
Shut the fuck up, okay?

2037
02:19:23,772 --> 02:19:27,442
You don't have the guts to look them in the eye when you kill them.

2038
02:19:27,609 --> 02:19:29,068
You gotta hide with that shit...

2039
02:19:30,279 --> 02:19:31,988
- He's getting up. - Let's do it.

2040
02:19:32,072 --> 02:19:33,698
Make you feel good?

2041
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:36,409
Make you feel good to kill a mama and her kids?

2042
02:19:36,493 --> 02:19:37,660
Make you feel big.

2043
02:19:39,079 --> 02:19:40,955
- Like you, big man! - Fuck you!

2044
02:19:41,665 --> 02:19:43,082
What do you think I am?

2045
02:19:43,167 --> 02:19:45,334
You think I kill two kids and a woman?

2046
02:19:45,502 --> 02:19:48,921
Fuck that! I don't need that shit in my life!

2047
02:19:51,258 --> 02:19:53,217
You die, motherfucker!

2048
02:19:58,182 --> 02:19:59,682
What do you think I am, huh?

2049
02:19:59,767 --> 02:20:01,934
You think I'm a fucking worm like you?

2050
02:20:02,227 --> 02:20:05,772
I told you, man! I told you, don't fuck with me!

2051
02:20:05,981 --> 02:20:08,274
I told you, no fucking kids!

2052
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,984
No, but you wouldn't listen!

2053
02:20:10,069 --> 02:20:12,528
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.

2054
02:20:18,035 --> 02:20:20,328
Nick, where the fuck you been?

2055
02:20:21,622 --> 02:20:23,039
On a delivery?

2056
02:20:23,874 --> 02:20:25,833
Where the hell is Manny?

2057
02:20:25,918 --> 02:20:27,794
I been calling all over. Where is he?

2058
02:20:27,878 --> 02:20:30,296
I don't know, Tony.

2059
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:32,215
He's been gone the last couple of days.

2060
02:20:32,299 --> 02:20:33,508
He didn't say nothing.

2061
02:20:33,592 --> 02:20:34,759
He's gone? What? Where?

2062
02:20:34,843 --> 02:20:38,763
I left him in fucking charge, man! Where the fuck is he?

2063
02:20:38,889 --> 02:20:41,224
You can't trust nobody anymore!

2064
02:20:41,308 --> 02:20:44,727
I don't know, Tony. He just took off.

2065
02:20:44,812 --> 02:20:45,937
He didn't say nothing.

2066
02:20:46,021 --> 02:20:47,063
He took off?

2067
02:20:47,856 --> 02:20:49,107
Are you all right?

2068
02:20:49,191 --> 02:20:51,234
No, I'm not all right! I'm pissed!

2069
02:20:51,318 --> 02:20:52,485
When I get back there,

2070
02:20:52,569 --> 02:20:54,612
I'll kick some ass all over the place!

2071
02:20:54,696 --> 02:20:56,114
When you coming back?

2072
02:20:56,198 --> 02:20:57,532
I'm coming back tonight!

2073
02:20:57,866 --> 02:20:59,951
This fucking cocksucker.

2074
02:21:00,577 --> 02:21:04,956
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.

2075
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:08,000
Gone? Where?

2076
02:21:08,085 --> 02:21:09,961
She got to see you right away.

2077
02:21:10,045 --> 02:21:13,756
Tell her I'll call her tonight.

2078
02:21:13,966 --> 02:21:17,135
Listen to me. What about Elvie? She call?

2079
02:21:17,261 --> 02:21:19,554
No.

2080
02:21:19,638 --> 02:21:21,389
Okay, listen to me.

2081
02:21:21,473 --> 02:21:23,808
If she calls, just tell her I love her.

2082
02:21:23,892 --> 02:21:26,060
Okay? Just tell her that.

2083
02:21:49,877 --> 02:21:51,711
- You hear from Manny? - No.

2084
02:21:51,795 --> 02:21:53,671
Your mama called, she gotta see you.

2085
02:21:53,755 --> 02:21:57,884
Sosa's been ringing every half hour. He sounds pissed.

2086
02:21:57,968 --> 02:21:59,677
Get him on the phone. Elvie call?

2087
02:21:59,761 --> 02:22:00,761
No.

2088
02:22:03,807 --> 02:22:06,767
You keep trying Manny. I want that cocksucker here.

2089
02:22:06,852 --> 02:22:07,935
I want him here now! Okay?

2090
02:22:08,020 --> 02:22:09,061
Okay.

2091
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:12,315
Come on. Go ahead, get him! Let's go. Come on!

2092
02:22:26,997 --> 02:22:31,417
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know.

2093
02:22:32,336 --> 02:22:35,004
They told me.

2094
02:22:35,088 --> 02:22:37,048
Okay. I'm coming over.

2095
02:22:37,132 --> 02:22:41,802
I'll be over to see you. I'll be over, yeah.

2096
02:22:44,097 --> 02:22:46,057
Put it on the speaker.

2097
02:22:56,109 --> 02:22:58,236
What happened, Tony?

2098
02:22:59,196 --> 02:23:00,613
Alex, how you doing?

2099
02:23:00,697 --> 02:23:02,114
What happened?

2100
02:23:02,449 --> 02:23:04,784
Oh, we had some problems.

2101
02:23:07,037 --> 02:23:08,037
Alex?

2102
02:23:08,121 --> 02:23:09,455
Tony, what happened?

2103
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:14,085
We had a little problem.

2104
02:23:14,169 --> 02:23:15,211
I heard.

2105
02:23:15,295 --> 02:23:16,462
How you hear that?

2106
02:23:16,546 --> 02:23:18,714
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

2107
02:23:18,799 --> 02:23:21,759
He was not supposed to give that speech.

2108
02:23:24,054 --> 02:23:27,390
Well, your guy, Alberto, he's a piece of shit.

2109
02:23:27,474 --> 02:23:29,725
I told him to do something, he didn't listen,

2110
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,310
so I canceled his contract.

2111
02:23:31,395 --> 02:23:33,854
My partners and I are pissed off.

2112
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:36,190
That's okay. No big deal.

2113
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:39,443
There's other Albertos. We'll do it next month.

2114
02:23:39,695 --> 02:23:41,737
No, Tony, you can't do that.

2115
02:23:42,281 --> 02:23:45,283
They found what was under the car.

2116
02:23:46,159 --> 02:23:48,828
Now our friend has got security up the ass.

2117
02:23:49,121 --> 02:23:52,665
The heat will come down hard on my partners and me.

2118
02:23:53,458 --> 02:23:55,418
There's not gonna be a next time,

2119
02:23:55,502 --> 02:23:57,336
you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!

2120
02:23:57,421 --> 02:23:59,213
Take it easy when you talk to me.

2121
02:23:59,339 --> 02:24:04,176
I told you a long time ago, you fucking monkey, not to fuck me!

2122
02:24:04,261 --> 02:24:06,220
Who the fuck you think you're talking to, huh?

2123
02:24:06,305 --> 02:24:07,513
You want to fuck with...

2124
02:24:07,889 --> 02:24:11,309
Who the fuck you think I am, your fucking bellboy?

2125
02:24:11,977 --> 02:24:14,895
You want to go to war? We take you to war, okay?

2126
02:24:16,648 --> 02:24:19,066
Alex, you there? Hey!

2127
02:24:19,151 --> 02:24:22,611
He's not there. Cálmate, man.

2128
02:24:24,031 --> 02:24:27,908
She got a place of her own. She don't tell me where.

2129
02:24:28,118 --> 02:24:30,453
One night, I follow her in a taxi.

2130
02:24:30,579 --> 02:24:33,247
She goes to a fancy house in Coconut Grove.

2131
02:24:34,291 --> 02:24:36,083
Where'd she get the money? You!

2132
02:24:36,209 --> 02:24:37,585
You were giving her the money!

2133
02:24:37,711 --> 02:24:39,170
You see what you do to her?

2134
02:24:39,254 --> 02:24:40,421
I don't give her that much money.

2135
02:24:40,505 --> 02:24:41,630
You did!

2136
02:24:41,757 --> 02:24:43,549
One time, $1,000 you gave her.

2137
02:24:43,633 --> 02:24:44,884
Was a guy with her?

2138
02:24:45,594 --> 02:24:47,553
I don't know.

2139
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:50,014
There was this car in the driveway.

2140
02:24:50,098 --> 02:24:51,849
I know if I go there, she'll kill me.

2141
02:24:51,933 --> 02:24:52,975
She's like you.

2142
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:54,727
Where's the place? Where is it?

2143
02:24:54,936 --> 02:24:57,897
400 something...

2144
02:24:57,981 --> 02:24:59,148
Citrus Drive.

2145
02:24:59,274 --> 02:25:01,609
400 what? 409, I think.

2146
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:05,071
You gotta talk to her, Antonio. She don't listen to me.

2147
02:25:05,155 --> 02:25:06,989
She says to me, "Mira, shut up!

2148
02:25:07,115 --> 02:25:08,324
"Mind your own business."

2149
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:10,284
Exactly like you do to me.

2150
02:25:10,410 --> 02:25:13,162
Ever since you came back, she's been getting this way.

2151
02:25:13,288 --> 02:25:14,372
I gotta go.

2152
02:25:14,456 --> 02:25:15,956
Why do you have to hurt everything?

2153
02:25:16,083 --> 02:25:18,084
Why do you have to destroy

2154
02:25:18,168 --> 02:25:20,461
everything that comes your way?

2155
02:25:24,508 --> 02:25:25,883
409 Citrus Drive.

2156
02:25:25,967 --> 02:25:27,009
Okay.

2157
02:25:27,302 --> 02:25:29,345
Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.

2158
02:25:29,429 --> 02:25:30,471
Fuck!

2159
02:25:30,847 --> 02:25:33,641
Okay. Listen, boss, I'll try again.

2160
02:26:06,675 --> 02:26:09,969
You stay here. Keep trying Manny, okay?

2161
02:26:56,224 --> 02:26:57,349
Tony.

2162
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:12,299
We got married just yesterday.

2163
02:28:12,384 --> 02:28:14,093
We were gonna surprise you.

2164
02:28:19,808 --> 02:28:21,308
Jesus, Tony.

2165
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:23,978
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.

2166
02:28:24,062 --> 02:28:25,271
We gotta get outta here.

2167
02:28:25,814 --> 02:28:27,481
Go get Gina.

2168
02:28:35,657 --> 02:28:36,824
No!

2169
02:28:43,498 --> 02:28:46,375
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!

2170
02:28:46,501 --> 02:28:48,127
God!

2171
02:28:56,469 --> 02:28:58,178
Tony, we can't stay here. We gotta go.

2172
02:28:58,305 --> 02:29:00,180
We gotta get out of here.

2173
02:29:40,055 --> 02:29:41,430
Come on, Gina.

2174
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:47,269
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

2175
02:29:47,395 --> 02:29:49,521
You got her? I got her.

2176
02:30:16,925 --> 02:30:20,803
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!

2177
02:31:05,807 --> 02:31:07,307
We put some pills into her.

2178
02:31:07,392 --> 02:31:08,726
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

2179
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:10,519
She's cooling down. Right?

2180
02:31:10,603 --> 02:31:12,396
She's gonna be fine. Just fine.

2181
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:13,564
Right.

2182
02:31:16,192 --> 02:31:18,026
What are we gonna do now?

2183
02:31:22,490 --> 02:31:23,699
Do?

2184
02:31:28,538 --> 02:31:30,205
We're going to war.

2185
02:31:31,416 --> 02:31:33,584
That's what we're gonna do.

2186
02:31:37,130 --> 02:31:40,215
We're gonna eat that Sosa for breakfast!

2187
02:31:42,552 --> 02:31:45,179
Close that fucker down.

2188
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:53,103
Tony, take it easy.

2189
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:02,029
All right, Ernie. Let's go.

2190
02:32:02,113 --> 02:32:04,156
We'll take care of the house.

2191
02:33:15,186 --> 02:33:17,062
Come on.

2192
02:33:17,146 --> 02:33:19,648
This cocksucker's gonna run all over you.

2193
02:33:36,416 --> 02:33:39,334
Come on. I'll bury these cocksuckers.

2194
02:33:48,261 --> 02:33:50,929
We gotta get organized here.

2195
02:34:02,108 --> 02:34:05,360
Fuck! Manny.

2196
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:14,161
How the fuck I do that?

2197
02:34:18,291 --> 02:34:20,709
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

2198
02:35:32,198 --> 02:35:33,323
Tony.

2199
02:35:42,542 --> 02:35:43,542
Gina.

2200
02:36:00,977 --> 02:36:03,103
Is this what you want, Tony?

2201
02:36:14,282 --> 02:36:17,200
You can't stand for another man to be touching me.

2202
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:21,496
So you want me, Tony, huh?

2203
02:36:22,373 --> 02:36:23,457
Huh?

2204
02:36:25,251 --> 02:36:26,752
What are you talking about?

2205
02:36:26,878 --> 02:36:28,295
Ah.

2206
02:36:28,379 --> 02:36:29,838
Is that it?

2207
02:36:33,718 --> 02:36:35,093
Here I am, Tony.

2208
02:36:40,058 --> 02:36:42,267
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

2209
02:36:45,063 --> 02:36:46,688
I'm all yours now.

2210
02:36:47,648 --> 02:36:48,648
Gina.

2211
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:51,651
You better come and get me now.

2212
02:36:52,570 --> 02:36:54,488
All right. Come on. Come and get me.

2213
02:36:54,572 --> 02:36:56,031
Come and get me.

2214
02:36:57,033 --> 02:36:58,950
You do it now before it's too late.

2215
02:37:02,497 --> 02:37:03,705
Oh, come on, Tony.

2216
02:37:05,875 --> 02:37:07,042
Fuck me.

2217
02:37:11,089 --> 02:37:13,507
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

2218
02:37:30,399 --> 02:37:31,441
Die!

2219
02:37:45,581 --> 02:37:48,291
They're all over the place! Get out of here!

2220
02:37:57,802 --> 02:37:58,802
Gina.

2221
02:38:11,691 --> 02:38:15,861
Come on. Look at your face. It's all dirty.

2222
02:38:33,421 --> 02:38:35,005
Please talk to me.

2223
02:38:36,841 --> 02:38:38,383
Don't be mad at me.

2224
02:38:38,634 --> 02:38:41,970
Please. Gina, come on.

2225
02:38:43,764 --> 02:38:47,434
I love Manny, you know?

2226
02:38:47,768 --> 02:38:49,019
I love him.

2227
02:38:51,063 --> 02:38:53,565
And I love you, too, you know?

2228
02:39:20,301 --> 02:39:21,593
Give me a smile.

2229
02:39:21,677 --> 02:39:23,053
They're coming from everywhere!

2230
02:39:23,137 --> 02:39:25,972
Tony, open up! Open the fucking door!

2231
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,601
Please! Tony!

2232
02:39:29,685 --> 02:39:31,686
Let me in, boss! Please!

2233
02:39:31,896 --> 02:39:33,939
Tony, open the fucking door!

2234
02:39:55,836 --> 02:40:00,966
You wait here, okay? I'll be with you. I'll be back.

2235
02:40:04,470 --> 02:40:06,805
You wait for me. I'm coming back.

2236
02:40:10,685 --> 02:40:13,103
Okay, Sosa. You want to fuck with me?

2237
02:40:17,733 --> 02:40:19,317
You're fucking with the best!

2238
02:40:24,115 --> 02:40:25,824
You want to fuck with me?

2239
02:40:27,618 --> 02:40:29,411
You cockroaches.

2240
02:40:32,748 --> 02:40:35,500
You want to play games? Okay, I play with you.

2241
02:40:40,298 --> 02:40:41,923
You wanna play rough?

2242
02:40:43,426 --> 02:40:45,593
Say hello to my little friend!

2243
02:40:48,931 --> 02:40:50,515
You want to play rough?

2244
02:40:51,684 --> 02:40:54,519
There! You like that?

2245
02:40:56,397 --> 02:40:57,689
You want more?

2246
02:41:04,780 --> 02:41:05,989
You whores!

2247
02:41:07,408 --> 02:41:08,533
Cowards!

2248
02:41:56,165 --> 02:41:57,665
Want to fuck with me?

2249
02:42:14,517 --> 02:42:16,267
Go ahead!

2250
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:18,770
Come on!

2251
02:42:21,482 --> 02:42:24,192
How do you like that, huh?

2252
02:42:24,443 --> 02:42:26,403
You fucking maricón!

2253
02:42:28,823 --> 02:42:30,532
You think you can take me?

2254
02:42:30,616 --> 02:42:32,867
You need a fucking army if you gonna take me!

2255
02:42:32,952 --> 02:42:37,288
You hear? Come on! I take you all to fucking hell!

2256
02:42:43,129 --> 02:42:46,339
Who you think you fucking with? I'm Tony Montana!

2257
02:42:47,258 --> 02:42:49,843
You fuck with me, you fucking with the best!

2258
02:42:54,056 --> 02:42:55,640
I'm still standing.

2259
02:42:59,937 --> 02:43:05,942
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

2260
02:43:06,026 --> 02:43:07,777
You think you kill me with bullets?

2261
02:43:07,862 --> 02:43:09,863
I take your fucking bullets! Go ahead!
