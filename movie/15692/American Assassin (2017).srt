You wanted to kill them all, and then go on killing.

136
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,440
是不是挺极端的

我觉得一点也不极端
No, I don't think that's extreme at all.

他们这样的人
I think people like that deserve to die

139
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,780
就得让他们死的很难看

140
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,850
关于你父母的死 你还记得多少

I was 14.

145
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,860
我只记得这些
That's what I remember.

146
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,090
你的行为举止方面有些问题
You started having discipline problems.

147
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,390
曾被三个寄宿学校退学
Got yourself kicked out of three boarding schools.

148
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,330
我知道 只是不知道为什么会这样
Yeah, yeah. I know. I wonder what that was about.

149
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,600
谈谈那个沙滩上发生的事
Let's talk about what happened after that day on the beach.

150
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,570
我的天 又谈这个 你在逗我么?
Oh, Jesus Christ. Again? Are you kidding me?

151
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,640
是的 又谈这个
Yeah, again.

152
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,710
你在那之后是不是就自暴自弃了
You gave up everything after that, didn't you?

153
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,880
你本科在布朗大学就读
Your grad studies at Brown University.

154
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,320
我失去了兴趣
I must have lost interest.

155
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,720
对一切都失去了兴趣?
In everything?

156
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,520
不 不是这样
No, not everything.

157
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,400
再见 费雷恩博士
See you later, Dr. Frain.

158
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,700
明天 同一时间见面么
See you tomorrow, same time?

159
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,740
换个新面孔来见你
I like the new look.

160
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,010
我是艾琳·肯尼迪
Irene Kennedy, CIA Deputy Director

161
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,510
中情局反恐部副主任
in charge of Counterterrorism.

162
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,980
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

163
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,750
你知道你在这呆了多久么
Any idea how long you been here?

164
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,150
30天
30 days.

165
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,860
够你想通一些事了
Enough time for you to figure out a couple things.

166
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,430
是啊 关于我自己的事 我想通了不少
Yeah, yeah. I've figured out a lot about myself.

167
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,500
过的很充实 谢谢
It's been a very reflective time. Thank you.

168
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,930
当时在现场你可能撑不过20秒
You wouldn't have made it through the next 20 seconds there alive.

169
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,640
天知道呢
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

170
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,040
你告诉费雷恩博士 说你要杀掉曼苏尔
You told Dr. Frain you thought you were gonna kill Mansur

171
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,740
扫平他的老巢
and wipe out his whole cell.

172
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,970
这只是个开始
For starters.

173
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,440
米奇 你心里还打着更大的算盘吧
You had an even bigger agenda, didn't you, Mitch?

174
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,450
你是怎么想的
What did you think,

175
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,950
你想一个又一个扫平恐怖分子的据点?
you were gonna jump from cell to cell taking out terrorists?

176
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,420
铲奸除恶?
Righting the world's wrongs?

177
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,080
我这不是搞定了曼苏尔么
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

178
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
比你有能耐啊
I mean, it's more than you accomplished.

179
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,660
我要跟你说一些事
I'm gonna let you in on something.

180
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,520
我们这的人不知道要拿你怎么办
Our people here, they don't know what to do with you.

181
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,960
很多人就觉得把你扔进一个高级别监狱就行了
A lot of them think we should just throw you in a supermax.

182
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,830
至于我嘛
Me?

183
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,000
米奇 我对你的计划很感兴趣
I like your agenda, Mitch.

184
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,700
如果你加入我们 我可以帮你实现你的目标
I can help you with it, if you throw in with us.

185
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,670
我们甚至可以把你培养成专业的特工
We can teach you how to play with the big boys.

186
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,540
让我先打断你一下
Yeah, let me stop you right there.

187
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,170
您认为我18个月前没考虑过
You don't think I considered that 18 months ago?

188
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,840
加入中情局么
Joining the CIA?

189
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,640
我觉得自己一个人行动干掉曼苏尔
I made the decision to pursue Mansur on my own

190
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,750
是因为我觉得我自己能办到
'cause I knew I could get it done.

191
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,920
你要明白 只有我才能帮你
What you need to understand is that I'm the only way.

192
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,620
达成你的目的
To get what you want.

193
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,990
为什么我要相信你
Why the hell would I trust you?

194
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,830
因为我相信你
Because I believe in you.

195
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,560
你只能指望我了
And I'm all you've got.

196
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,700
已确认
What's been confirmed is

197
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,240
一个退役的俄国
the enriched plutonium has been stolen

198
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,170
核设施里的浓缩铀遭窃
from a decommissioned Russian nuclear facility.

199
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,240
如果他们找到一个核起爆器
If they get their hands on a nuclear trigger

200
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,040
再找一个能造核弹的物理学家
and a physicist to build it,

201
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,610
他们就能装备核武器 引爆核弹
they'd be able to arm it and detonate it at any time.

202
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,110
汤姆?
Tom?

203
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,150
他的测试结果十分优秀
He's testing through the roof.

204
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,250
我从没见过这么厉害的
Might be the best I've ever seen.

205
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,590
我们监控了他6个月
We've had him under surveillance for six months.

206
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,090
关注了他的格斗术 枪法
Martial arts, gun skills.

207
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,130
我以前监控过不少这种民间人员
I've surveilled dozens of these vigilantes.

208
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,530
他很与众不同
This one is different.

209
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,260
艾琳 这些情况我都清楚
Yeah, well, I've gone over these, Irene.

210
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,600
他不服从命令 难以控制
He's noncompliant, he's oppositional.

211
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,600
我们跟着他找到了曼苏尔的老巢
He got us into Mansur's cell.

212
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,600
比我们强太多了
That's a hell of a lot more than we ever managed.

213
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
猎户星是我们这的
All right, Orion is an elite unit, Irene.

214
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,240
秘密精英特种部队
A secret unit.

215
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,880
只向你我二人报告
Reports to you, me, and no one else.

216
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,050
我不想为这人
I don't want to be responsible

217
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,510
可能闹出的乱子负责
for that kind of mistake.

218
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,980
你说话的语气和赫尔利一样啊
Now, that's Hurley talking.

219
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,950
他给我打了两次电话 就谈这个
Yeah, well, he's called me twice about this.

220
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,920
这样的人能把他吓坏
This kind of psych profile scares the hell out of him.

221
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,750
他估计会觉得
As far as he's concerned,

222
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,760
你给他派了个一心想复仇的疯子
you're sending him a Section 8 with an ax to grind.

223
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,620
在沙滩上发生的事
What happened to that kid on the beach,

224
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,990
改变了他的一生
it changed him.

225
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,830
就算通过训练 你也不可能对任何人起那么大的影响
You can't train that into someone.

226
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,690
他现在的心理状况正是我梦寐以求的
His psych profile is exactly what I've been looking for.

227
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,300
做过测谎仪测试么
Polygraph?

228
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,570
完美通过
Flying colors.

229
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,870
那就祝赫尔利好运吧
All right. Good luck with Hurley.

230
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,870
艾琳
Oh, Irene.

231
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,740
我们两个小时内会收到
We'll have fresh intel on the Russian

232
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,580
关于俄罗斯浓缩铀事件的情报
plutonium situation in two hours.

233
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,040
保持电话联系
Stay by your phone.

234
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,160
罗阿诺克峡谷 弗吉尼亚

235
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,560
你可以把眼罩摘下来了
You can take the blindfold off.

236
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,940
- 关于这家伙 有什么我要知道的?
So, what do I need to know about this guy?

237
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,100
- 你是说斯坦·赫尔利么
Stan Hurley.

238
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,200
他是个勇士
He's a warrior.

239
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,800
前海豹突击队特种兵
Ex-Navy SEAL.

240
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,940
我父亲和他一起在波斯湾服役过
My daddy served with him in the Persian Gulf.

241
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,160
你负责这个项目么
Did you go through this program?

242
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,160
我只是了解情况 不负责这个计划
I went through a program. Not this one.

243
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,190
这个计划不只是培养一个间谍
It's not like becoming a spy or Special Ops,

244
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,560
或者特工那么简单
none of those things.

245
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,200
知道了
Good.

246
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,570
米奇·拉普的心理报告

247
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,920
米奇 你的目标是什么
So, what are your goals, Mitch?

248
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,690
我的目标?
My goals?

249
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,370
我的目标就是如果他们知道我要来了
My goal is to have them lie awake at night,

250
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,860
会吓得睡不着觉
knowing I'm coming for them.

251
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,320
你不抽烟了?
I thought you were supposed to be on the patch.

252
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
- 你看了他的测试结果么
You saw those tests.

253
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,430
- 看了
Yeah, I saw them.

254
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,930
十分优秀
He's off the charts.

255
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,030
优秀的人我也见过
I've seen off the charts before.

256
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,700
军队出身的人员可能会养成一些难以摆脱陋习
And he's got none of the bad habits

257
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,730
然而他就不必了
he'd have to unlearn if he had military training.

258
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
难以摆脱?
Unlearn?

259
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,870
斯坦
Come on, Stan.

260
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,750
让你手下的那些海豹突击队进大城市里试试
You drop one of your Navy SEALs in an urban setting,

261
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,010
周围的人能轻松发现他们是当兵的
you can spot the boot camp on them a mile away.

262
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
- 现在不是..
We're not fighting the...

263
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,710
- 不是冷战那时候了 我知道
Cold War? Yeah, I know.

264
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,580
副主任女士 你一直在提醒我这点
You keep telling me that, Miss Deputy Director.

265
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,950
我的天 你这么尊敬我了
Oh, wow. "Miss Deputy Director."

266
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,780
你父亲会支持我这么做的
Your daddy would agree with me.

267
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,320
我每48小时联系你一次
I'll be checking in with you every 48 hours.

268
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,860
我早上坐飞机去伦敦
I'm on a plane to London in the morning.

269
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,930
赶紧去抽几根吧
And go back on the patch, for God's sake.

270
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,060
别让我失望
Don't prove me wrong.

271
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,370
她不会回来了
She ain't coming back.

272
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,710
嘿
Hey.

273
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,980
看着我
Eyes front and center.

274
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,210
抱歉
Sorry.

275
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,330
抱歉? 你以为我是你的大学教授么
"Sorry"? Do I look like one of your college professors?

276
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,250
小子 你要称呼我为"长官"
You talk to me, you call me "sir," son.

277
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,220
是 长官
Yes, sir.

278
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,190
你他妈的来这干什么呢
What the fuck you doing here?

279
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,100
是不是
Did you have some bad things happen to you,

280
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,100
有一些不幸的事发生在你身上
some shitty things happen to you?

281
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,070
你想把那些恐怖分子赶尽杀绝
Now you wanna kill those mean old terrorists.

282
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,200
就是那些你口中所谓的“坏人”
Go get some bad guys.

283
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,080
你凭什么认为
What makes you think you can make it

284
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,310
你能通过我的选拔?
through my selection process?

285
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,010
- 我能说话么 长官
Permission to speak, sir?

286
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
- 说吧 有话直说
Sure, go ahead if you got something to say.

287
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,810
因为你来这 就是个错误
Like this is all a big mistake and you wanna go home.

288
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,280
你想回家么
You wanna go home? Good.

289
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,320
赶紧滚吧 要不然我帮你滚
Get the fuck out of here. I'll drive you myself.

290
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,210
不想 长官
Not at all, sir.

291
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,410
我觉得我们还是直入主题吧
I was gonna suggest we maybe speed this whole thing up?

292
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,330
我们俩过几招
My guess is, if you and I go hand-to-hand,

293
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,130
我能否通过
you could probably figure out inside of 20 seconds

294
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,460
你的选拔
whether or not I have what it takes to make it

295
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,990
一看便知
through your selection process.

296
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,260
您觉得呢
So, what do you think?

297
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,500
给你一张床 一个储物柜
We got an empty cot, empty footlocker.

298
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,330
看你够不够格留在这里了
They're both yours as long as you can last.

299
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,240
我觉得可以
Sounds good.

300
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,010
跟我来
Follow me.

301
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,270
待会见
See you out there.

302
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,550
顺便说一句 我听说了不少关于你的事
Heard a lot about you, by the way.

303
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,210
想看看你有多大的能耐
Excited to see what you got.

304
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
来杀我
Kill me.

305
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,430
总有人以为这样就能要我的命
People think you can slice a man's throat like this.

306
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,840
只有拍电影才可能这么容易
That's only in the movies.

307
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,300
就是这
Right there.

308
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
用力压下去
Do it.

309
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,470
不会有动静 不会搞成乱摊子
No noise. No mess.

310
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,820
维克多 你来
Victor, you're up.

311
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,860
我操
What the fuck, man?

312
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,830
谁他妈带了把刀
Who grabs a fucking blade?

313
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,950
上啊
Come on, you fuckin' pussy. Let's go!

314
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,020
应该注意到后面的情况
You gotta have eyes in the back of your head.

315
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,600
你犹豫一下 就死了
You flinch, you die.

316
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,370
猎户座计划的核心就是完成任务
Orion is about the mission.

317
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,540
能者就上
It ain't about you.

318
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,210
你要是战死沙场 你就是个孤魂野鬼
You go down out there, you're a ghost, you don't exist.

319
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,550
没有人会回来救你的
There's nobody, nobody coming back for you.

320
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,620
要是你被俘了
You're about to be captured.

321
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,630
那就告别这个世界吧
Bye-bye.

322
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,250
伊朗大使馆 伦敦

323
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,470
我们现在了解到
We now know 15 kilos of plutonium-239

324
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,340
俄罗斯那边有15千克的钚-239不翼而飞
went missing during the Russian breach.

325
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,410
足够造一个核武器了
It's enough to build a full-scale nuclear weapon.

326
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,540
但可能需要倾全国之力才能完成核武器的建造
But that would likely require the resources of a nation-state.

327
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,410
作为伊朗参谋总长
As Iranian Chief of General Staff,

328
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,380
我们对此事同样关切
I share your concern.

329
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,350
我们同你们一样 都在关注事态发展
We have been monitoring the situation as you have.

330
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
我们也不知道是什么情况
I'm afraid we too are in the dark.

331
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
对伊朗来说 建造核武器
For Iran, of course,

332
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,490
是不可能的
a nuclear weapon is off the table.

333
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,120
我们签订了条约的
We have a treaty.

334
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,490
有一些伊朗人对这个条约不太满意
You have countrymen who are not too happy about that.

335
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,100
我们监控了你们的浓缩项目
We monitor your nuclear enrichment program pretty closely,

336
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,930
发现有人在俄罗斯黑市上购买了这些钚-239
but black market plutonium-239 from Russia...

337
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,670
关于黑市的情况 高层无从得知
Would be difficult for inspectors to detect.

338
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,300
您是肯尼迪女士 对吧?
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

339
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,940
作为伊朗国防部长 我向您保证
I assure you as Minister of Defense

340
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,180
我们知道如果我们伊朗
that we in Iran recognize how much the spirit of comity

341
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,650
通过任何途径购买钚燃料
between our nations would be compromised

342
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,550
都会影响到我们的国家利益
if we were to acquire

343
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,720
有违国际精神
weapons-grade plutonium from any source.

344
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,320
的确如此
Yes, it would.

345
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,990
这话对伊朗境外的势力同样适用
Same goes for your clients outside Iran,

346
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,560
真主党 哈马斯
Hezbollah. Hamas.

347
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,360
胡塞武装
The Houthis.

348
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,200
无论在谁的手中 核武器都是危险的
Nuclear weapons are a danger in any hands, Director.

349
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,170
这不就是你们入侵
Wasn't that your pretext for your invasion

350
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,740
我们邻国的理由么
of our neighbor to the west?

351
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,270
50万伊拉克人丧生
One that cost 500,000 Iraqi lives

352
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,640
留下一片废墟
and left a wake of destruction

353
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,570
整个地区至今动荡不安
from which our region has never recovered.

354
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,080
罗斯塔米将军 我们是掌握了确凿的情况才来这会面的
General Rostami, we came only to tell you what we know.

355
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,510
你们这算是威胁我们么
Is that a threat?

356
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,420
当然不是 比赫兹部长
Of course not, Minister Behruz.

357
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,150
各位先生 感谢参加这次会面
Gentlemen, I very much appreciate you meeting with us.

358
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,620
客气了
Not at all.

359
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,090
- 很遗憾 不能给你们提供更多情报
I only wish we could offer more insight.

360
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,130
- 谢谢您的支持
Thank you.

361
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,610
我不相信那个罗斯塔米将军
I don't trust General Rostami.

362
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,380
我们要低调行事
We need to keep this quiet.

363
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,440
猎户座计划进行的怎么样了
How ready is Orion?

364
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,380
我去问问赫尔利
I'll check in with Hurley.

365
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,780
为什么好几个小时了都没人来
Why is there no one on watch?

366
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,520
你们死定了
You're all dead.

367
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,760
是啊 是啊 知道了
Yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.

368
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,760
你死了
You're dead.

369
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,100
你想说什么 快说啊
You wanna say something to me? Say it. Go on, say it.

370
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,440
给你们30秒收拾
You got 30 seconds!

371
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,180
这些是你们的目标
These are your targets.

372
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,110
记住他们
Memorize them.

373
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,650
你们要能辨认出他们来
It's your responsibility to be able to identify them.

374
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,520
杀掉一个武装人员 得一分
You shoot a combatant, you get a point.

375
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,550
没击中的话 会受到一次电击
You miss, you get a shock.

376
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,520
非战斗人员 会受到更强的电击
You shoot a noncombatant, you get a bigger shock.

377
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,060
如果武装人员击中了你
Combatant shoots you...

378
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,560
我就这么说吧 你那时候会感觉到的
Let's just say you're gonna feel it.

379
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,590
准备好了吗
Ready?

380
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,260
开始
Go.

381
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,740
赫尔利在干什么
What's Hurley doing?

382
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,740
他脑子出问题了
He's fucking with his head.

383
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,780
操
Fuck!

384
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,450
这狗屁的模拟训练
Fucking AR bullshit.

385
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,090
华沙 波兰

386
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,370
我们开始吧
Shall we?

387
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,340
好
Okay.

388
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,840
挺不错的
That's clever.

389
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,410
钚原料
Raw plutonium.

390
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,950
之前商量好的 是浓缩的
Highly enriched, as promised.

391
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,550
希望如此
Let's hope.

392
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,160
先生们 听到仪器发出响声真是太棒了
Wow, that's a beautiful sound, gentlemen.

393
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,290
那我就拿走了
May I?

394
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,870
嗯
Okay.

395
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
快转账
Wire the money.

396
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,930
马上就转
That, I can do.

397
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,870
我就拿手机
This is a cell phone.

398
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,250
把你的车开走 有一个重要官员要经过这里
Gotta move all the vans. The Cardinal's visiting.

399
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,520
好的
Okay.

400
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,000
五分钟内就走
Okay. Five minutes.

401
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,290
车里的是什么
What's going on in there?

402
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
纪念品
Souvenirs.

403
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,760
可能是紧急情况 请求增援
Possible code red, backup needed.

404
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,010
别紧张 没什么情况
There's nothing going on.

405
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,390
进来看看嘛
Come in.

406
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,780
目前看来
It now appears that all seven victims

407
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,430
7名死者
were shot with a single weapon,

408
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,400
死于同一把手枪下
believed to be a Glock 29.

409
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,900
车内发现了武器级钚的踪迹
Traces of weaponized plutonium

410
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,470
同时还发现了
were detected inside the van

411
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,040
三具俄罗斯人
where the bodies of three Russians

412
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,510
和两具波兰警察的尸体
and two Warsaw police officers were found.

413
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
俄罗斯政府已经确认
The Russian government has confirmed

414
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,380
核燃料的化学指纹表明
that the chemical footprint of the plutonium in question

415
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,380
这正是托博尔斯克
is a match to the plutonium that was stolen

416
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,650
废弃核设施内
from the decommissioned

417
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,780
失窃的钚燃料
processing facility in Tobolsk.

418
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,790
波兰警方正在和国际刑警组织合作
Security footage is being analyzed by Polish police,

419
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,960
分析监控录像
now working in conjunction with Interpol,

420
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,020
试图确认枪手的身份
to identify the shooter and his connection

421
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,730
调查他与钚燃料失窃案之间有何联系
to the missing plutonium.

422
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,790
枪手的身份尚不得知
The identity of the shooter remains unknown...

423
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,830
你好 打扰一下
Hi, excuse me.

424
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,330
有什么我能帮你的
- How can I help you? - Question.

425
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,660
目标 活动中

426
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,800
- 需要我帮你么
May I help you?

427
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,970
- 不 谢谢
No, thanks. I'm okay.

428
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,890
嘿
- Ow! Ow! Ow! - Hey! Hey! Hey!

429
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,400
拉普 妈的
Rapp! God damn it!

430
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,510
你要控制住自己
You have to stay under control.

431
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,730
妈的
Dickhead!

432
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,400
这家伙不知道什么时候住手
Asshole doesn't know when to quit.

433
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,400
你在逗我么 我刚刚救了你
You're kidding me, right? I just saved your ass.

434
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,680
拉普 你要知道什么时候该停手
You've gotta know when the mission's been accomplished, Rapp.

435
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,180
- 长官 这家伙.. - 听着
- Sir, he's a fucking... - Which he did.

436
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,510
别以为你只有眼前这一个目标
Never assume your target is the only target.

437
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,520
敌人可能看起来没什么威胁 但实际上心狠手辣
The enemy dresses like a deer and he kills like a lion.

438
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,710
我们也要像他们一样心狠手辣
And that's what we gotta do.

439
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,150
希望你能表现更出色
We just gotta do it better.

440
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,780
那就这样吧
All right.

441
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,420
你这混蛋
You're an asshole.

442
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,000
出事了
We got a problem.

443
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,570
六周前 有人闯入
Six weeks ago, there was a breach

444
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,770
俄罗斯的一个废弃钚燃料设施
at a decommissioned Russian plutonium facility.

445
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,910
我听说了
I'm aware.

446
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,540
但是你不知道 有15千克的钚燃料失窃了
What you don't know is 15 kilos of plutonium went missing.

447
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,010
还是武器级的
Weapons-grade.

448
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,950
这么多
That's a shit-ton of plutonium.

449
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,180
就这么落入他人之手
And it just changed hands.

450
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,190
我想给你看点东西
I wanna show you something.

451
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,460
看看这个
Take a look at this.

452
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,890
你应该认识这张脸吧
Does that face bong a gong for you?

453
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,460
还是只有我一个觉得这人很熟悉
Or is it just me?

454
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,230
不可能是他
It can't be him.

455
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,770
在轰炸了巴马科的大使馆之后 我们派出无人机又确认了一次
Our drones took him out after the embassy bombing at Bamako.

456
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,670
我们无法完全确定尸体身份
We never got a positive ID.

457
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,710
那是我们这的叛逃特工
That's our mad dog out there.

458
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,980
那行 我们先假设是他
All right. Let's say it's him.

459
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,710
艾琳 不用假设 就是他
It's him, Irene.

460
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,080
现在有一个一石二鸟的机会
This gives us a chance to kill two birds with one stone.

461
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,590
哈姆迪·沙里夫
Hamdi Sharif.

462
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,120
他是一个武器贩子 目前在土耳其
He's an arms dealer working out of Turkey.

463
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,990
四周前他买了一个俄罗斯设计的核装置起爆器
Four days ago, he purchased a Russian-designed nuclear trigger.

464
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,960
他肯定打算把这玩意转手
And he's gonna be selling it.

465
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,590
沙里夫手上有诱饵
Sharif's got the honey.

466
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,830
我们只需等待猎物上钩
Now we just wait for the bee.

467
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,030
我们派人破坏他们的交易
We go in, we fuck up their deal.

468
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,200
把他们都干掉
And we take 'em both out.

469
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,540
你去伊斯坦布尔
You're going to Istanbul.

470
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,740
我们那边有特工接应
We have an agent in place.

471
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,920
她会在机场接你
She'll meet you at the airport.

472
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,680
明白
All right.

473
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,010
安妮卡·奥格登
Annika Ogden. We've had her on the ground over there

474
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,150
她在那潜伏5年了
for five years.

475
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,620
让拉普参与这次行动
I want Rapp on the team.

476
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,890
你没开玩笑吧
Really?

477
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,090
斯坦 他已经准备好了吧
He's ready, Stan.

478
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,520
艾琳 我觉得他目前还没准备好
Actually, Irene, he's not ready.

479
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,860
但我会让他准备好的
But he will be.

480
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,870
长官 找我有事么
You wanted to see me, sir?

481
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
对 把门关上
Yeah. Shut the door.

482
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,540
我们有任务了
We're shipping out.

483
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,770
把东西放桌上
Set those down there.

484
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,180
你喜欢看电影么
You like movies?

485
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
喜欢
Sure.

486
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,920
我想给你看点东西
I got something for you.

487
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,050
这他妈是什么鬼
What the fuck is this?

488
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,780
- 我也觉得挺操蛋呢
Yeah, I thought so.

489
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,970
- 你说什么
You thought so?

490
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,120
- 是啊
Yeah.

491
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,190
你为什么大难不死呢 拉普
Why are you even alive, Rapp?

492
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,830
你有没有问过自己这个问题
You ever asked yourself that?

493
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:36,060
为什么是你 而不是这些人
Why you? You know, of all those people?

494
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,760
我觉得 肯定是因为你很特别
You're special, I guess.

495
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,960
我的天
Oh, my God!

496
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,330
需要我调高音量么
You want me to turn it up?

497
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,300
- 我愿意嫁给你 - 拿着吧
- I'll marry you! - Take it!

498
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,340
你这混蛋 把视频关上
You're a fucking coward, you know that? Turn that shit off.

499
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,340
这是我妈妈的戒指 你觉得怎么样
What do you think? It's my mom's ring.

500
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,980
关掉
You gonna turn it off?

501
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,310
卡特丽娜!
Katrina!

502
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,020
我是不是应该为你感到遗憾
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

503
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,950
我觉得还是不吧
I don't.

504
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,830
你犯了大错
You made a big mistake.

505
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,970
你让情绪影响到了你的判断力
You let emotion cloud your judgment.

506
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,340
永远不要受制于自己的情绪
Never, ever let it get personal.

507
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,810
明白了么
You understand?

508
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,620
我明白了
Yeah, I got it.

509
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,090
准备好 早上5点出发
Be ready to go by 5:00.

510
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,360
我们4点半见面
See you at 4:30.

511
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,630
伊斯坦布尔 土耳其
You know what you're gonna do here?

512
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,680
我知道我们来这干什么吗
No, sir.

513
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,700
- 不知道 长官 - 嗯
Correct. You don't.

514
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,210
多观察 少说话
So keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.

515
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,270
听我命令
And wait for my orders.

516
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,300
哈姆迪·沙里夫 房地产大亨 武器贩子
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate mogul/arms dealer.

517
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,640
养活了不少恐怖分子
He's like Santa Claus for terrorists.

518
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,010
一个人渣
Scumbag.

519
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,910
小子 省省你那些
Spare me your junior-year-abroad

520
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,680
幼稚的看法吧
moral opinion, would you, Rapp?

521
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,010
长官 这不只是我的个人看法而已 他就是个人渣
Not really an opinion, sir. Sharif's a piece of shit.

522
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,410
我们这不是圣战
It's not a crusade.

523
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,450
任务以实用为重 不要受制于...
This mission is practical. Don't make it...

524
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,780
个人情绪?
Personal?

525
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,970
没错
Exactly.

526
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,120
明白 长官
Yes, sir.

527
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,920
维克多 你跟我一起
Victor, you're with me.

528
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,020
拉普和安妮卡 你们注意观察情况
Rapp, you and Annika are eyes on.

529
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,290
沙里夫日常生活很规律
Sharif has a routine.

530
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,940
看看他最近有什么异常
Let's see if anything breaks his pattern.

531
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,900
- 明白了么 - 是 长官
- Got it? - Yes, sir.

532
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,930
我们有48小时完成任务
All right, we got 48 hours.

533
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,300
要做的干净利索 不留痕迹
Quick, clean. No footprint.

534
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,230
这里的各股势力也是错综复杂的
This town's ready to blow as it is.

535
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,040
你要去哪
Where the hell are you going?

536
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,620
抱歉
Excuse me.

537
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,080
解密进行中

538
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,130
- 这他妈太冒进了
That was fucking reckless, Rapp.

539
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,830
- 长官 我这是主动出击
I took the initiative, sir.

540
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,510
- 可能会搞砸的 - 但我完成了
- He could've been made. - Well, I wasn't.

541
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,340
结果出来了
Here we go.

542
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,940
明天上午11点
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

543
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,110
同他的情妇见面之前
A meeting at a restaurant on Akbiyik Street.

544
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,010
他会去阿克比克街的餐馆
That's right before Sharif goes to see his mistress.

545
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,480
这不符合他平时的日程
That breaks his pattern.

546
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,060
更关键的是
I'll tell you what'll break his pattern.

547
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,520
当他的助理告诉他手机丢了
When that fucking assistant tells his boss

548
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,950
那就糟糕了
he lost his goddamn phone.

549
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,220
他不会说的
He won't.

550
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,020
他太怕沙里夫了 不敢告诉沙里夫自己搞砸了
He's too afraid of Sharif to let him know he screwed up.

551
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,020
那行 我们明天行动
All right. We go tomorrow.

552
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,320
任务目标是?
What's the mission, sir?

553
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,130
干掉买家 干掉卖家
Eliminate the target. Eliminate the recipient.

554
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,290
带走货物
Obtain the package.

555
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,030
- 货物是什么
And what's the package?

556
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,220
- 到时候就知道了
We'll know it when we see it.

557
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,460
你打头阵
You're lead.

558
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,770
你做后援
You're backup.

559
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,770
我们在街对面监视现场情况
We will watch from across the street.

560
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,680
我们俩扮演一对情侣
We get to play lovers.

561
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,920
你们俩相恋多久了
How long have you been married?

562
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,360
他以为我们已经结婚了
He thinks we're married.

563
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,270
别想太多
Don't think too much.

564
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,940
你会紧张过头的
You'll lose your nerve.

565
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,180
我觉得不会

这家伙会搞砸的
that could shut us down.

624
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,870
这小子不会遵守命令
Kid can't even follow a fucking order.

625

维克托没办到的事 拉普办到了
Victor got made. Rapp didn't.

626

他妈的 你为什么这么看好这个小子
Why does this kid give you such a fucking hard-on?

627
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,510
别他妈的跟我这么说话 我是你的上级
Don't talk to me like that! I'm your superior.

628
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,610
我的上级? 艾琳
My superior, Irene?

629

你知不知道 我花了多久才找到
Do you have any idea how long I spent looking

631
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,550
这么有才 这么有胆识的小伙子
for someone with that kid's talent and balls?

632
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,660
- 让拉普留下
Rapp stays.

633
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,160
- 这是命令么
You're giving me an order?

634
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,420
没错
That's an affirmative.

635
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,590
让我跟他单独谈会
Can you give us a minute?

636
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,800
看看这个
Look at this.

637
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,570
起爆器肯定在那辆车上
The trigger must have been in that car.

638
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,670
看看
Look at him.

639
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,010
就是他
Lookin' at me.

640
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,080
这家伙干出来的好事
Everything he did there,

641
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,580
都是我教出来的
I taught him how to do it.

642
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,210
斯坦
Stan.

643
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,720
我真不应该把他从海军里招过来
I should've left him in the Navy.

644
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,830
- 我要亲手杀了他
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

645
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,990
- 斯坦 听我说
Stan, listen to me.

646
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,520
重要的是
The only thing that matters now

647
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,000
这个疯子已经拿到了
is that fucking lunatic has everything he needs

648
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,090
制取核武器的全部环节
to build a nuclear weapon.

649
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,960
他拿到了起爆器 现在要买通一个物理学家
He's got a trigger. Now he needs to buy a physicist.

650
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,500
你现在要搞清楚
We just have to figure out

651
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,100
他们要在哪造核武器
where they're gonna build this thing.

652
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,870
本
Ben.

653
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,840

That computer our boy Rapp lifted from Sharif's house,

654
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:38,110
显示 有一笔两百万美元的款项

打到了一家罗马银行的账户上 等待支取
Cash prepped for withdrawal.

656

部长 我最近读了一些东西
I've been reading up, Minister.

660
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,860
你们伊朗人可能从小时候起就知道了
You Iranians probably all learn this growing up,

661
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,990
签订禁核条约前心里就有数了
or at least you did before you signed that treaty.

662
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,530
我没想到还有这么些有趣的情况
But me, I had no idea about these fun facts.

663
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,260
要是你的话我就不会进去
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

664
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,870
起爆点三英里半径内的人都会蒸发掉
Inside three miles, apparently you just vaporize.

665
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,070
有一些幸免于难
Some folks don't.

666
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,070
他们的皮肤会被烤黑 烧焦
They get all black and charred,

667
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:37,580
扭曲成一团 没人知道为什么会成这个样子
and dense as lead, and no one knows why.

668
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:41,010

Inside five miles, everything is sucked into a void,

669
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,250
温度比太阳中心还高
hotter than the core of the sun.

670
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,790
你们觉得怎么样
How about that?

671
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,150
剩下的钱在哪
Where's the rest?

672
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,860
搞定了这个再给你们剩下的钱
You'll get the rest of your money when the job's done.

673
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,170
我派来的物理学家呢
Where is my physicist?

674
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,830
他拿到钱后 我们把他接过来
He'll pick up his money, then we'll pick him up.

675
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,860
他住在罗马的一家酒店
He's staying at a hotel in Rome.

676
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,970
我们会在一天内完成武器的组装
We'll need an extra day to configure the weapon, then it's all yours.

677
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,170
你们想杀掉多少犹太人就杀多少
Kill as many Jews as you want.

678

为我们的胜利祈祷吧 兄弟
Do you practice Salah, brother?

679
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,750
我收到款项 完成任务
I receive my payment, complete the project.

680
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,290
我就是干这个的 兄弟
That's my practice, brother.

681
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,590
很好
Very well.

In Istanbul.

686
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,860
他似乎总是先我们一步
It seemed like he was a step ahead of us.

687
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,930
嘿 你打不打算告诉我
Hey, you gonna fill me in here or what?

688
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,010
有些坏人作恶
There's some bad people planning on doing some bad things,

689
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,230
我们要阻止他们
and it's our job to stop them.

690
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,070
关于维克多 你好像没说什么
You still haven't said anything about Victor.

691
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,770
维克多消失了 维克多不存在了
Victor's gone. Victor doesn't exist.

692
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,850
拉普 你觉得我们在这里是干什么的
What is it you think we do here, Rapp?

693
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,050
我们干掉那些该死的家伙
I think we kill people who need to be killed.

694

- 那谁来告诉你应该干掉谁呢
And who do you trust to tell you?

695
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,450
- 遵守命令就行了
I follow orders.

696
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,290
你想执行命令的时候 才执行命令
No, you follow orders when they suit you.

697
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,820
你加入我们
This whole thing is pretty much

698
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,790
只是实现自己目标的一种手段
just a means to an end for you, isn't it?

699
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,230
长官 我经历了很多事
A lot's happened in my life, sir.

700
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,260
- 是么
Really? Huh.

701

- 是啊
Yeah.

702
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,760
所以你觉得 我们派你到这来
So you think you were sent here

703
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,070
是为了给你人生中的遗憾 愤怒
as an outlet for your self-pity,

704
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,200
愧疚 找个发泄口?
and your anger, and all your guilt. Right?

705
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,740
爱国主义之所以还存在
Patriotism exists

706
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:01,810
是因为有你我这样的人为崇高的事业而奋斗
because people like you and people like me need a higher cause.

707
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,140
为了比我们俩更重要的目标而奋斗
Something bigger than us.

708
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,950
你脑子里你认为是"复仇"的玩意
That stink coming outta you

709
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,880
就是狗屁
you like to call "revenge," the rest of us call "shit."

710
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,430
如果你沉浸于其中
And as soon as it starts to feel good,

711
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,250
你就不再是一位合格的特工
that's when you stop being a professional.

712
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,720
那时候的你一文不值
And then what are you?

713
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,960
来说点好消息吧
Tell us something good, darling.

714
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,860
我们入侵了他们的系统
We're in their system.

715
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,970
一有人把钱从沙里夫的账上取走
The moment that transfer from Sharif's account is picked up,

716
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,940
我们就能马上收到消息
we'll know it.

717
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,870
你的笑容像红海一样美
Boy, you just smile, and the Red Sea parts.

718
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,240
地中海也很美啊
Works in the Med, too.

719
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,510
你太美艳了
I'll bet it does.

720
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,990
有人把沙里夫账户里的钱取出来了 两百万美元
Cash withdrawal from Sharif's account. $2 million, U.S.

721
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,140
扫描中

722
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,900
未找到匹配项

723
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,620
已匹配

724
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,530
发现那个物理学家了 我们走
There's our physicist. Let's go.

725
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,540
欢迎来到博斯科洛大酒店 祝您入住愉快

726

谢谢
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

727
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,990
他住1448间
He's in 1448.

728
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,820
我们住他隔壁
And we're next door.

729
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,410
- 密码

Suite 1448. We're in 1449, right next door.

733
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:24,020
抓住那个物理学家 把他带出来
All right. We'll grab the physicist,

734
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,220
我去接应你们
and we'll take out whosever coming for him.

735
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,890
每15分钟给我打一次信号
Signal every 15 minutes.

736
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,530
嘿
Hey.

737
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,080
我听说了你的遭遇
I know what happened to you.

738
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,610
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

739

我很能理解你
I understand you.

740
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,020
比你认为的更甚
More than you know.

741
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,270
我知道失去我们所爱的人是多么的心痛
I know what it's like to lose people you love.

742
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,640
我们要把这些坏蛋绳之以法
We're gonna get these fuckers.

743
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,350
我靠
Fuck!

744
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,990
你们他妈的在哪呢
Where the hell are you?

745
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,410
赫尔利
Hurley... Where is he?

746
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,280
在哪里
I don't know what you're talking...

747
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,670
我不知道你在说什么
Where is he?

748
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,570
他在哪
He outside?

749
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,510
在外面
Please, no.

750
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:57,350
饶命啊
Please.

751
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,720
赫尔利 什么鬼
Hurley, what the fuck?

752
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,200
你不是在盯梢么 怎么没发现他们
I thought you were eyes on, why didn't you spot 'em?

753
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,490
他们比我们早到宾馆
They were already in the damn hotel.

754
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,120
当地的黑手党在与他们合作
Local mafia's working with 'em.

755
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,530
我会联系肯尼迪副主任 已经抓到物理学家了
I'll tell Kennedy we have the physicist.

756
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:25,240
刚才那边是什么情况
What the hell just happened out there, huh?

757
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:27,310
那家伙把我们的行动搞砸了两次
That's twice now this guy's blown up our entire op.

758
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,710
目标是什么
What's the target? Huh? What's the target?

759
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,380
- 我不知道 先生 - 说啊
- I don't know, mister. - Yeah, you do.

760
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,150
你以为我看不出来么
Do you think I'm stupid?

761
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,490
他是个美国人 他认识你
He's an American. He said your name.

762
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,880
是你训练了他？
Did you train this guy?

763
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,640
- 你喜欢抽烟么
You like to smoke?

764
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,350
- 我的天
Oh, Jesus Christ!

765
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,220
你抽烟么
- Are you a smoker? - I don't...

766
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,650
这习惯可不太妙啊
- Wait! - Bad habit.

767
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:47,390
慢着 我说我说
Wait, stop! Wait, wait! I know something.

768
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:48,870
- 什么 - 我说我说
- What do you know? - I know something.

769
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,560
他们称那个家伙为“幽灵”
There is a man... There is a man they call Ghost.

770
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,500
“幽灵” 那个伊朗人就是这么称呼他的
Ghost. I think it was an Iranian man said it.

771
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,910
他们在哪造炸弹
- Uh-huh. Where are they building the bomb? - I just...

772
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,380
- 他们在哪造炸弹 - 我只是拿了钱而已
- Where are they building it? - Took the money.

773
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,170
他们在哪造炸弹
Where are they building it?

774
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,170
再给你点时间好好想想
All right, here. Take some time to think about it.

775
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,480
就是那个“幽灵”么
Ghost. Is that his name?

776
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,180
为什么他要追踪你
Why is this guy after you?

777
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,780
是不是出于个人原因?
Something personal, sir?

778
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,550
他们在造核弹
They're building a nuke.

779
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,590
去纳沃纳宾馆
Hotel Navona.

780
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,420
洗个澡吧
- Clean yourself up. - Wait.

781
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,520
别走啊
Don't go.

782
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,660
美国总统命令美国海军第六舰队
America's president has ordered the Sixth Fleet

783
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,930
离开意大利那不勒斯的海军基地
out of the U.S. Naval base in Naples, Italy.

784
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,560
朝西南方向航行
The Sixth Fleet is now southwest off the coast...

785
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,170
我来帮你
Let me help you.

786
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,400
没事的 我自己来
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

787
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,670
还是我来吧
You're not.

788
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,650
你今天觉得如何
How are you holding up?

789
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,760
我今天很害怕
I was afraid today.

790
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,630
还以为我们都要丢命了
I thought we were going to die.

791
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,900
我要么一直很害怕 要么永远不害怕
Yeah, I'm either always afraid or never afraid.

792
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,570
我不知道我究竟是什么感受
I don't know which.

793
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,220
贴好了
There you go.

794
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,490
放松一会儿吧
Just relax now.

795
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,290
明天再去找“幽灵”
We'll search for Ghost tomorrow.

796
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,810
- 你吓到我了
You scared me.

797
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,740
- 你是谁
Who are you?

798
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,350
你什么意思
What do you mean?

799
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,350
你之前说“幽灵”
You said "Ghost."

800
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,570
- 那又怎么了
What about him?

801
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,750
- 我从来没提过这个名字
I never told you that name.

802
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:07,990
赫尔利告诉过我的
Hurley did.

803
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,920
你就扯淡吧
Yeah, I think you're full of shit.

804
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,620
你到底是谁
- Mitch. - Who are you?

805
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,670
- 你有毛病吧 - 你为谁效劳
- Mitch, what's wrong with you? - Who do you work for?

806
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,330
我是中情局的
I'm CIA.

807
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,330
别他妈的骗我
Now don't fucking lie to me!

808
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,690
我没撒谎
I'm not lying!

809
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:22,030
你是伊朗人
You're Iranian, aren't you?

810
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,530
放开我
Get the fuck away from me!

811
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,540
你跟那帮伊朗人是一伙的?
Are you working with the Iranians?

812
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,610
说实话
Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth!

813
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,840
去死吧
Go to hell!

814
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,860
你是伊朗情报部门的么
You Iranian intelligence?

815
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:55,960
你是伊朗情报部门的么
Are you Iranian intelligence?

816
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:06,540
关于幽灵 你知道多少
What do you know about Ghost?

817
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,320
我们需要解密装置
We're gonna need the decryption device.

818
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,830
你说的对 米奇
You were right, Mitch.

819
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,470
很难让这个伊朗间谍开口
This Iranian mole is a tough nut to crack.

820
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,900
我只从她那问到了她的接头人 阿扎德·阿沙尼
All I could get from her was her handler. Azad Ashani.

821
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,050
他是我的一个朋友
Happens to be a friend of mine.

822
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:43,440
我要去见见他
I'm gonna go pay him a visit.

823
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,660
- 我跟你一起去
Okay, I'm going with you.

824
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,840
- 不行
No.

825
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,470
我要你待在这
I need you to stay here.

826
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,040
肯尼迪带了一群中情局
Kennedy's on her way with the CIA team

827
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,480
和摩萨德特工过来
and a Mossad team.

828
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,750
她肯定会问我你去哪了
She's gonna ask me where you went.

829
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,410
我要怎么说
What the hell am I supposed to say?

830
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,720
没错 自己动点脑子
That's right, she is. And you're gonna be smart,

831
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,760
别说出去
and you're gonna keep your mouth shut,

832
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,450
掩盖我的行踪
and you're gonna cover my ass.

833
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,540
我还留着它呢
I still have it.

834
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:27,910
很不错啊
Very nice.

835
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:32,580
斯坦 见到你 我总是很高兴
I am always happy to meet you, Stan...

836
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,520
但是你每次找我谈的事 都让我高兴不起来
But never happy why.

837
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,090
下次我们见面的时候 可以去吃个比萨
Well, maybe next time we'll meet for pizza.

838
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,390
那个女孩子挺有骨气的
Your girl's tough, by the way.

839
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,030
对她好点
Go easy on her.

840
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,360
她是我的侄女
She's my niece.

841
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,930
嗯
Yeah.

842
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,840
你有什么消息要告诉我么
What have you got for me?

843
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:03,110
这件事的幕后黑手是罗斯塔米将军
The men behind all this are General Rostami,

844
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,710
伊朗参谋总长
our military chief of staff,

845
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:08,610
还有国防部长比赫兹
and our defense minister, Behruz.

846
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,820
两个人都很有权势
Both are very powerful,

847
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:14,990
都对禁核协议的签署心怀不满
and both are very angry about the nuclear treaty we made with you.

848
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,890
过去的两年内他们
They have been trying to acquire

849
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,790
一直试图搞到核材料
nuclear materials for the past two years.

850
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,530
他们找来了那个
And they are the ones

851
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,990
叫“幽灵”的雇佣兵
who hired the mercenary called Ghost.

852
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:29,970
罗斯塔米在德黑兰 比赫兹在罗马
Rostami is now in Tehran, but Behruz is here in Rome.

853
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,940
我让手下通过他的手机定位到他的位置
Annika has been tracking his movements through his cell phone.

854
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,110
他们在哪造核弹?
And they're building it here?

855
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,840
要是我知道就好了
I wish I knew.

856
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,610
我们抓住他们的物理学家了
We have their physicist.

857
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,580
他们没法做了
They can't build it without him.

858
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:42,680
但是
But...

859
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,780
那个雇佣兵
The mercenary asked Behruz

860
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,650
叫比赫兹找一个伊朗的科学家来
to use one of ours, an Iranian.

861
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,450
比赫兹同意了 他们匆忙行事
Behruz agreed. That was rash.

862
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,190
说明他们急于尽快完工
It means they are in a hurry.

863
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,990
他们的目标是以色列?
And the target's Israel?

864
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,160
我也想告诉你更多信息
I wish I had better information for you.

865
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,840
赫尔利在哪
Where the hell is Hurley?

866
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,700
告诉我现在是什么情况
You gotta tell me what's going on here. Now.

867
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,710
那家伙是赫尔利培养出来的么
That guy he trained, who the hell is he?

868
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,590
现在你不需要知道这个
That's not something you need to know right now.

869
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,640
你们在掩盖什么
What are you covering up?

870
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,680
当你有了足够等级的安全许可
When you've got a level-5 security clearance

871
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:23,160
有了20年的工作经验 再来找我谈这个问题吧
and 20 years' experience, talk to me.

872
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,080
要不然就闭嘴 乖乖干活吧
Until then, shut up and do your job.

873
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:33,190
我要你们解密并扫描她的手机
I want her cell phone decrypted and scanned.

874
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,030
当地警方一小时前在港口发现一具尸体
Local PD pulled a body from the harbor an hour ago.

875
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,590
胸部中弹
Gunshot to the chest.

876
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:38,730
死者是 伊朗情报官员 阿扎德·阿沙尼
Iranian intelligence officer, Azad Ashani.

877
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,000
我的天
Christ!

878
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:43,030
赫尔利就是去见他了
That's the guy Hurley went to meet.

879
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,800
这个混蛋
Stupid son of a bitch!

880
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,580
我觉得我们要去找到赫尔利的下落
All right, so what do we do? We gotta go after him.

881
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,800
他们在造一个他们的核弹 拉普
There's a fucking nuke in play, Rapp.

882
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,110
找到核弹是我们的任务 唯一的任务
That's the mission, and the only mission.

883
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,880
不管你怎么看
This is now a joint CIA-Mossad operation,

884
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,180
现在这是中情局和摩萨德的联合行动
whether we like it or not.

885
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,720
给我拨通局长的电话
Can you get the Director on the phone?

886
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,810
你就打算把他弃之于不顾了?
So you're just gonna write him off then?

887
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,680
这就是你的计划?
That's the plan?

888
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:02,880
斯坦·赫尔利几乎算得上是我的亲人了
Stan Hurley is the closest thing to family I've got.

889
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,060
要是他现在在场
And if he were standing here right now,

890
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,720
他只会问一个问题
his only question would be,

891
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,630
为什么我们要浪费时间去讨论他的问题
why are we wasting our breath talking about him?

892
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,260
没你的事了
You're through here.

893
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,820
你准备回程 这是命令
You're going home, that's an order.

894
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:15,230
现在给我坐下 闭嘴
Now, sit down and shut up.

895
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,910
为什么你要帮我
Why are you helping me?

896
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,880
阿沙尼已经死了
Your handler Ashani was killed.

897
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,740
赫尔利去见他了 突遭意外
Hurley was with him. Something happened.

898
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,780
我们要去追踪他们
I'm going after him.

899
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,850
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

900
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:20,990
我们得动身了
We gotta go.

901
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,910
斯坦
Stan.

902
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,980
我等这一刻已经很久了
I've looked forward to this.

903
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,910
当然了 罗尼
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

904
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,990
我要给你看点东西
I wanna show you something.

905
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,050
行啊
All right.

906
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,630
看看这是不是野蛮人的作为
Savages. Right, Stan?

907
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:16,040
但我不怪他们
But you know something? I don't blame them.

908
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,400
而怪你
I blame you.

909
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,970
如果你不违抗命令
Never would've happened

910
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,180
就不会这样了
if you would have followed orders, Ronnie.

911
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,210
你阵亡了 你就成幽灵了
"You go down out there, you're a ghost."

912
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,740
你就消失了
"You're a John Doe."

913
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,210
要是你被俘了
"You get captured?"

914
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,380
你还记得我说的话 我真高兴
Oh, you remember. That's very gratifying.

915
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,410
谢谢你
Thank you.

916
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,120
罗尼 你让我很自豪
You made me proud today, Ron.

917
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:36,190
你应该来救我的
You should've come for me.

918
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,160
你将更多人置于险境
Ten men would've died.

919
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,720
因为你他妈的没有遵守命令
You put 10 men's lives in danger,

920
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,760
你将更多人的生命置于危险之中
'cause you couldn't follow a fucking order.

921
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,060
- 去你妈的 - 去你妈的命令
- Fuck you. - Fuck orders.

922
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:45,800
重要的是我的性命
- Fuck the mission! - Fuck you.

923
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:48,160
我当时是你的手下 我信任你
This was me. I was your boy, I believe that.

924
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,300
你让我对你深信不疑
You made me believe that.

925
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,850
阿沙尼让手下
Ashani had their people tracking Minister Behruz's

926
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
追踪比赫兹的手机位置
secure cell phone.

927
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:06,110
我们找到了比赫兹 就找到了赫尔利
So, we find Behruz, we find Hurley.

928
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,220
米奇
Mitch!

929
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,400
看看你啊
Oh, yeah, look at that.

930
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,100
- 你是从阿勒颇的那些人那里学会这招的么
Did you learn that in Aleppo?

931
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:10,440
- 不
No.

932
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,710
斯坦 你教过我的 要让敌人出乎意料
You always told us what to expect, Stan.

933
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:20,850
现在告诉我你的手下在哪
Now, where's the rest of your team?

934
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,880
- 我的天 罗尼
Come on, Ronnie, really?

935
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,760
- 别再叫我罗尼了 - 你的手下在哪
Don't call me that. Where's the rest of your team?

936
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:27,950
你手下的那个新人 他一直在找我
Your new boy out there, he on my tail?

937
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:31,420
罗尼 这是你犯下的第一个错误
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie. There's your first mistake.

938
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,430
审讯的时候 不要直入主题
You never start with a real question.

939
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,760
要循序渐进
You start slow.

940
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,260
进入到受审人的头脑当中
You get inside your subject's head.

941
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:42,200
斯坦 我再问你一次
Stan, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

942
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,070
你犯的第二个错误
There's your second mistake. Number two.

943
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,540
第二个错误 就是 不要说“再问你一次”这种话
You don't say, "one more time." You already...

944
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,770
妈的
Damn!

945
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:56,010
斯坦 我犯的第三个错误是什么
Now, what's that third mistake, Stan?

946
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,980
是什么
Huh? What is it?

947
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,920
来啊 继续啊
Go ahead! Go ahead!

948
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:02,420
我还有9个指甲呢 真爽
I got nine more! I like this.

949
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,850
真爽啊 再来啊
I like it. Go ahead, bring it on!

950
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:05,960
你个混蛋
You motherfucker!

951
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,290
他想知道我们外面是不是有人
Ronnie wants to know if I got a team outside.

952
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,460
对吧
Right, Ron?

953
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,060
能不能安全的将核弹运走
If it's safe to move your bomb.

954
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,000
是不是有人在跟踪我们
Are we being followed?

955
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,230
我的这个接班人在哪
Where's the new me?

956
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,840
我做了调查 我了解他的一切情况
I've done my research. I know all about him.

957
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,340
你是说米奇么
"The new me..." Oh, you mean Mitch?

958
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:29,040
我跟你说 米奇是个难以预测的家伙
You know, Mitch, he's unpredictable.

959
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,310
你算不准他的
You never know about Mitch.

960
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,910
他行踪不定
He might be here, he might be there.

961
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,520
跟你很像 但你更加疯狂
He's like you, but you're a real Section 8.

962
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,580
够了
Enough.

963
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,780
- 操你妈
Schizo mom.

964
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,950
- 他们在哪
Where are they?

965
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,450
- 你个没爹养的 - 他们在哪
- Loser dad. - Where are they?

966
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,950
我的天
God!

967
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,860
你的手下在哪
Where's the rest of your team?

968
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,330
- 去你妈的
Half-wit mom, psycho dad...

969
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,560
- 你手下的其他人在哪
Where's the rest of your team?

970
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,090
你这人渣 - 你手下的其他人在哪
- You're pond scum. - Where are they?

971
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,330
你这混蛋
Pond scum! You're fucking...

972
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,370
关于你接头人的事 我很难过
I'm sorry about your handler.

973
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,980
阿沙尼是我的叔叔
Ashani was my uncle.

974
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,950
肯定是比赫兹和罗斯塔米派人刺杀了他
I'm sure it was Minister Behruz

975
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,850
他们相对以色列发动核战争
and General Rostami who had him killed.

976
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,550
我们试图组织他们
They want nuclear war with Israel.

977
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,420
在和他们的斗争中
We tried to stop them.

978
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,320
我的兄弟和父亲双双丧命
My brother and father both died fighting them.

979
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,160
在这转弯
Corviale. Turn here.

980
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,000
你知道我最大的错误
You know what my real mistake was?

981
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,300
就是信任你
I trusted you.

982
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,340
你让我觉得我能干出一番大事
You made me feel like I was the Second Coming.

983
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,140
你就像我的父亲一样
And you acted like my father.

984
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:50,580
我信赖你 信赖美利坚合众国海军
I trusted you and I trusted the United States Navy.

985
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:02,560
美国做的事 都是正确的 是么 斯坦
U.S. of A. Does it, it's gotta be good. Right, Stan?

986
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,630
只是 从来都没人告诉我
Except

987
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:08,030
你所负责的究竟是一个怎样的项目
nobody told me the business y'all are really in.

988
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,170
你们制造出怪物
You create monsters.

989
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,500
这就是恶果
That's just what you do.

990
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,270
这么虐待我的人
Those people who did this to me,

991
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:20,470
你觉得他们是野蛮人么
you think they're barbarians?

992
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,380
扯淡
Bullshit.

993
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,290
我之前说的破解做的怎么样了
Where's the decryption I asked for?

994
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,020
我们开工前拉普把手机拿走了
Rapp grabbed her smartphone before we could get any of it.

995
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,190
目前找不到他
And we can't find him.

996
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:39,030
监控摄像头显示
Surveillance cameras picked up Rapp

997
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,090
他5分钟前打晕了我们的一个特工
taking out our agents five minutes ago.

998
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:46,200
你这是在干什么呢
What the hell are you doing?

999
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,370
这里发生的一切
There's not a single thing happening here

1000
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:57,610
都是你一手造成的
that you didn't make happen.

1001
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:03,180
上帝保佑这操蛋的美国 对吧
God bless fucking America, huh, Stan?

1002
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,120
我不能告诉你米奇在哪
I can tell you where Mitch is...

1003
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:14,690
斯坦 我犯的第三个错误是什么
What's that third mistake, Stan?

1004
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,060
- 米奇.. - 我听不见你说的话
Mitch... I can't hear you.

1005
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,160
我操
Fuck!

1006
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:28,340
你犯的第三个错误 永远不要和敌人站的太近
Third mistake, never get too close.

1007
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,300
赶快搞定你的私事
Finish your personal business here.

1008
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,010
你的任务已经结束了
Your work is done.

1009
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,440
炸弹已经装备好了
The bomb is armed.

1010
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:34,740
- 启动计时器了么 - 是的
- Timer is set up? - Yes.

1011
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:36,180
他在耍你
He's playing you.

1012
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:38,410
炸弹是给他造的 不是给你的
Bomb's not for you, it's for him.

1013
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,010
这只是他的计划罢了
It was his plan all along!

1014
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,440
连不上网络
Dead zone.

1015
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,740
这里收不到任何信号
We're not getting any signals here.

1016
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,120
等一下
Wait a second.

1017
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,280
你想拿核弹干什么
What are you gonna do with it?

1018
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:56,680
斯坦 不是我要干什么
No, Stan.

1019
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,450
应该是我们要干什么
"What are we gonna do with it?"

1020
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,720
罗尼 为什么选择罗马这个地方啊
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

1021
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,360
我喜欢罗马
I like Rome.

1022
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:08,490
这里食物很好吃
It's good food.

1023
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,630
永远不要以为 我会战死沙场
Never, ever thought I'd die in the field.

1024
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:20,070
是不是觉得我很疯狂
Ain't it crazy?

1025
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,110
我觉得我以后想
I always figured it would be, I don't know,

1026
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,480
住在一个森林小屋里 带着我的狗
some cabin in the woods with my dog.

1027
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:29,210
我的话嘛
Me?

1028
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,480
我选择过水上生活
I think I want water.

1029
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:34,620
死在海里大概是十分平和的
There's just something peaceful about dying at sea.

1030
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,620
来吧
All right.

1031
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,460
结束这一切吧
Let's get it over with.

1032
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:46,590
不 你想痛痛快快的死
No, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1033
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,690
我不会杀了你的
I ain't gonna kill you.

1034
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:50,100
斯坦 我要让你亲眼见证
You're gonna live to see

1035
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:52,100
你一手造成的灾难
the crown of your creation, Stan.

1036
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,270
数千美国人将会烧死
Thousands of Americans are gonna burn.

1037
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:59,100
就因为你
All because of you.

1038
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,240
好好观赏吧
Enjoy the show.

1039
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:05,340
做好准备
Get ready.

1040
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,550
启动倒计时
Go.

1041
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,750
求求你救救我
Please help me.

1042
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,550
安妮卡
Annika.

1043
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,050
你的父母是好人
Your family were very well respected.

1044
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:10,800
我是他们的朋友
They were my friends.

1045
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,770
混蛋
Bastard.

1046
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:18,060
我跟他们很熟
I knew them very well.

1047
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:19,910
求求你
Please I beg you.

1048
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:35,270
探测到一起爆炸
We've got an explosion detected.

1049
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:37,330
在这
Here.

1050
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:39,430
离菲乌米奇诺运河500米处
A half click off the Fiumicino waterways.

1051
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,840
爆炸点位于地下
It's underground.

1052
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:43,670
- 德尔塔一号小队 开始行动 - 出发
- Delta One, go! - Let's go.

1053
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:45,440
我们坐直升机过去
Get a chopper out there.

1054
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,740
拉普 你不应该来这的
You're not supposed to be here, Rapp.

1055
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,710
你想怎样 把我开除?
Yeah, what are you gonna do, fire me?

1056
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:23,340
那边还有一条通道 他搞到核弹了
There's another passage down there. He's got the nuke.

1057
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,440
- 你一个人可以吧 - 快去吧
You gonna be good?

1058
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,510
海军 救援直升机
Go. Go!

1059
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,880
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

1060
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:08,650
要不然她就死了
Or she's dead.

1061
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,720
米奇 我要去见我的亲人
I want to see my family, Mitch.

1062
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,620
不 安妮卡
No, Annika, you don't.

1063
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,060
我要去见我的亲人
I want to see my family.

1064
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:20,160
米奇 听话
Come on, Mitch. Be nice.

1065
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:21,830
她想活命
She wants to live.

1066
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,760
她想去见自己的家人
She wants to see her family.

1067
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,460
放下枪
Put the gun down.

1068
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:29,730
安妮卡
Annika!

1069
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,840
核弹会爆炸的
The bomb can't be stopped.

1070
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:30,540
你什么也做不了 就像那个在沙滩上死掉的女人一样
Just like you couldn't stop

1071
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,880
你救不了她
that beautiful girl from dying on the beach.

1072
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,780
艾琳
Irene.

1073
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:41,820
核弹在那艘船上
The bomb's on a boat.

1074
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,150
赫尔利
Hurley?

1075
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,750
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

1076
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,990
罗尼向在海上引爆核弹
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

1077
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,200
是不是第六舰队在附近巡逻
Is the Sixth Fleet out on maneuvers?

1078
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:56,900
我的天
Oh, my God.

1079
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,230
第勒尼安海 意大利

1080
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:58,230
把侦察卫星都调过来
Bring up ISR feeds.

1081
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,810
派飞机去现场侦查情况
Get me eyes in the sky over the coastline

1082
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,770
通知第六舰队 发出核爆警告
and put the Sixth Fleet on nuclear alert.

1083
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,840
汤姆
Tom.

1084
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,540
目标是第六舰队 他们目前离海岸线25英里
The target is the Sixth Fleet and it's 25 miles offshore.

1085
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,320
真是太耻辱了
It's a shame.

1086
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:20,860
你女朋友生前最后看到的一幕是 你没法救她
The last thing your girl saw was you not saving her.

1087
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:33,870
战斗警报
General quarters.

1088
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,800
全体人员回到各自岗位
All hands, man your stations.

1089
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:38,800
这不是演习 重复一遍 这不是演习
This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill.

1090
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,670
有一艘携带了核装置的小艇 正在接近中
Inbound, small vessel-borne nuclear device.

1091
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:50,680
小子 赫尔利是没好好教过你么
Didn't Hurley teach you anything, little brother?

1092
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,960
永远不要受制于自己的情绪
To never make it personal.

1093
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,370
我可没有受制于自己的情绪
This isn't personal.

1094
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:20,340
糟了
Shit.

1095
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,210
核弹上装了计时器和起爆装置
The bomb has a timer and a release trigger.

1096
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,850
炸毁小船会直接引爆核弹
We take out his boat, it'll detonate.

1097
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,850
如果核弹在水面爆炸
If it goes off above the waterline...

1098
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,750
那会是一场灾难 放射性物质会飘到大陆上空
Disaster. There'll be fallout all over the mainland.

1099
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,160
这里是美国海军弗林舰 准备攻击
USS Flynn... Prepare to engage.

1100
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,400
小艇转弯了
The boat is turning, sir.

1101
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,100
谁在开船
Who's driving that boat?

1102
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,640
那是拉普
Rapp.

1103
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:01,880
去接他
Go.

1104
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:03,810
- 长官您说什么 - 去接他
- Sir? - Go!

1105
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:14,020
你在干什么呢
What are you doing? Hurley.

1106
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:16,160
赫尔利
Hurley?

1107
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:17,700
我想把他救上来
Trying to get our boy to throw the bomb in the water.

1108
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:20,290
弗林舰 准备好了就可以开火
Flynn, you are clear to fire when ready.

1109
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:23,260
别开火 小艇已经掉头了
Do not fire, Commander. The boat is turning.

1110
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,270
不攻击的话 核弹迟早会爆炸
If we don't engage, that guarantees detonation.

1111
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,430
我知道这风险很大
I understand there's a risk,

1112
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,000
但这是我们最好的机会了
but this is the best chance we've got.

1113
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,040
妈的
Shit! God damn it!

1114
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,910
他在那呢
There he is.

1115
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:43,010
调至海军无线电频段
Get me on that boat's marine bandwidth.

1116
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:47,890
拉普
Rapp!

1117
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,160
拉普
Rapp!

1118
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:52,790
听到我了么 用无线电接听
Can you hear me? Pick up the radio!

1119
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:55,730
把炸弹从船上扔下去
Throw the bomb overboard!

1120
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,930
不行 我要带它离舰队远点
No way, sir, I gotta get further away from the fleet!

1121
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,330
拉普
Rapp!

1122
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,130
你他妈的这辈子 就服从我的命令行不行
For once in your life, take a goddamn order!

1123
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:04,030
