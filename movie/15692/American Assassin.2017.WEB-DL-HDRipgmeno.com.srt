1
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:05,657
Here we are in beautiful Ibiza,
Spain.

2
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,157
Beautiful sand.

3
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:09,657
Beautiful waves.

4
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:14,067
My favorite shorts.

5
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:17,097
And my favorite girl
who is about to get...

6
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,167
Oh, my God!

7
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:20,067
Hey!

8
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:21,906
- Come on, give it to me.
- No! Stop! Come on!

9
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,167
- Mitch!
- This is great!

10
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:24,677
I'm serious.

11
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:27,447
Oh. Oh, my God.
That is so cute.

12
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:29,977
Honey, this is like...

13
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,547
Let me film for just
a couple minutes.

14
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,717
- It's like we're honeymooners.
- Oh, my God!

15
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,517
â™ª Honeymooners â™ª

16
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:36,567
"Honeymoon"?

17
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,597
Yeah.

18
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:39,057
We're not married.

19
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:48,757
Katrina Harper...

20
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,467
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

21
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,456
Oh, my God.
Babe, stop it.

22
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:56,537
You're gonna make me...

23
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,267
If you get emotional,
you're gonna kill me.

24
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,607
I'm trying to get
through this, babe.

25
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:03,777
I love you, more than anything.

26
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:06,947
Will you marry me?

27
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:10,247
Oh, my God!

28
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:11,987
- Yes!
- Yeah?

29
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:13,547
Yes, Mitch Rapp.

30
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:14,857
I'll marry you.

31
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:17,957
Sorry, it's hard one-handed.

32
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:23,057
You like it?
It was my mom's ring.

33
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:26,867
I love it.

34
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,167
I love you.

35
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:39,306
- I'm still...
- Are you filming? Oh, my God!

36
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:41,076
Yeah, I'm still recording.
I'm trying to get this.

37
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,807
Come on, Mitch!

38
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:45,547
This is why I was filming now.
You see, now you get it.

39
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:46,777
Smile.

40
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:52,587
I'm gonna get drinks.

41
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:53,657
- Okay.
- Yeah?

42
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:54,727
Don't be too long.

43
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,957
I won't, I won't.

44
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,127
I love you.

45
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,157
I'll be back.

46
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,597
Engagement drinks in
the water, people.

47
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,697
Whoo-hoo!

48
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:11,937
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

49
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,107
Very sweet, thanks.
Babe, we're getting applause.

50
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,947
I love you.

51
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,207
Thank you.

52
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:33,627
Hola. Como estas?

53
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:34,927
What can I get you?

54
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:37,087
Um, can I just get
two drinks, please?

55
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,197
Dos bebidas, if that's right...

56
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:40,926
Um, I just got engaged,
so something special.

57
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,037
It can be anything, though.

58
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,297
Oh, you lucky guy.

59
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:48,767
Oh, can they be kinda
strong too? Is that cool?

60
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:51,677
Thank you, man.

61
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,387
Oh, whoa.
Maybe not that strong.

62
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:23,807
Katrina!

63
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,247
Katrina!

64
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:53,357
Katrina?

65
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,027
Katrina!

66
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,207
Mitch!

67
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,107
Mitch!

68
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,007
Mitch!

69
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:14,747
Katrina!

70
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,507
How are you tonight my brother?

71
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:52,527
I am ready to go on vacation.

72
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:58,265
Click encrypted link,
then download file.

73
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:11,887
We're gonna fucking set
your shit on fire, man!

74
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,987
Fuckin' burn,
motherfucker, burn!

75
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,797
To our brothers
across the globe...

76
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:20,197
Come join our fight against
American imperialism.

77
00:07:20,227 --> 00:07:23,067
They will pay for the
murder of our families,

78
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:27,067
our friends, and all children.

79
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:34,437
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

80
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,307
What is in your heart brother?

81
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:47,077
I want to bathe my hands in
the blood of the infidels.

82
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:51,577
We are logging your
keystrokes. Answer quickly.

83
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,797
Who was taken in the
Year of Sorrow?

84
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:59,797
Khadijah and Abu Talib.

85
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:05,887
Who was with the Prophet
for the Isra and Mi'raj?

86
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:11,897
The Angel Gabriel.

87
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,997
All right, stop! Come on, man!

88
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,567
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,447
Let him go, let him go.
Let him go, let him go!

90
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,107
Break it up. Let him go!

91
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,277
What the fuck is your deal, man?

92
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:50,907
That's it. You're
done, Rapp. Get out.

93
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,507
He keeps doing this shit.

94
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:53,747
Get out!

95
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,987
Have a nice fucking day.

96
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,317
You were out of line.

97
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:02,287
Back to work. Keep moving.

98
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:53,697
Get outta there!

99
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,106
You're gonna get yourself killed,
you dumbass!

100
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:56,307
What's up with this guy?

101
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,647
Fuck!

102
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:35,167
Rapp, why I gotta
tell you again?

103
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,287
Sorry, Mr. Nazir. I didn't
realize it was past 10:00.

104
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,477
I'll try to keep it down.

105
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,007
Yeah, enough with the sports.

106
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,207
Copy that. All right.
Thanks, Mr. Nazir.

107
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:09,967
He's up again.

108
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:23,247
Will you come here?

109
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:32,347
Allah wills that I join the
struggle wherever I am called.

110
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:04,777
Assalam-alaikum.

111
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,077
Walaikum-assalam.

112
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,927
If it were up to me,
I would not have chosen you.

113
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,797
But others have
decided differently.

114
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:39,017
Whomsoever Allah guides
there is none to misguide.

115
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:58,407
What is the name of the sister
of the Prophet, peace be upon him.

116
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:01,287
Huzafa bint Al-Haarith.

117
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,627
Wrong.

118
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:05,756
She was not the
Prophet's sister.

119
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:10,007
She is honored as the sister of
the Prophet, peace be upon him...

120
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:14,457
...because both suckled from her
blood mother, Halimah al-Sa'diyah.

121
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,337
Why have you come?

122
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:04,187
To help Adnan al-Mansur
achieve his people's destiny.

123
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,087
Inshallah.

124
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,957
I wanted to look in your eyes.

125
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:13,457
I don't trust you.

126
00:15:13,487 --> 00:15:15,197
I'm prepared to die a martyr.

127
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:17,957
What can I do to
earn your trust?

128
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,027
No!

129
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,977
Step away, now!

130
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:13,277
Come on!

131
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,507
The fuck off me!

132
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:18,817
He's dead, it's over.

133
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,947
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.

134
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,557
Area's secure.

135
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:30,057
You wanted to kill them all,
and then go on killing.

136
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:32,427
Pretty extreme, don't you think?

137
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,897
No, I don't think
that's extreme at all.

138
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,637
I think people like
that deserve to die

139
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,767
in the worst ways
you can imagine.

140
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,837
What do you remember about
your parents' death?

141
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:42,937
Car crash.

142
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,377
I was in Massachusetts.

143
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:45,907
They were in Tunisia
at the time.

144
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,437
I was 14.

145
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:49,847
That's what I remember.

146
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:52,077
You started having
discipline problems.

147
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:54,377
Got yourself kicked out of
three boarding schools.

148
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:59,317
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I wonder what that was about.

149
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:02,587
Let's talk about what happened
after that day on the beach.

150
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:05,557
Oh, Jesus Christ. Again?
Are you kidding me?

151
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:07,627
Yeah, again.

152
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:12,697
You gave up everything
after that, didn't you?

153
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:15,867
Your grad studies at
Brown University.

154
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,307
I must have lost interest.

155
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,707
In everything?

156
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,507
No, not everything.

157
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,387
See you later, Dr. Frain.

158
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,687
See you tomorrow, same time?

159
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:44,797
I like the new look.

160
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:49,997
Irene Kennedy, CIA
Deputy Director

161
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:51,497
in charge of Counterterrorism.

162
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,967
I know who you are.

163
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,737
Any idea how long you been here?

164
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,137
30 days.

165
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:02,847
Enough time for you to
figure out a couple things.

166
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:06,417
Yeah, yeah. I've figured
out a lot about myself.

167
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,487
It's been a very reflective
time. Thank you.

168
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:11,917
You wouldn't have made it through
the next 20 seconds there alive.

169
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,627
I guess we'll never
know now, will we?

170
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:17,027
You told Dr. Frain you thought
you were gonna kill Mansur

171
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:19,727
and wipe out his whole cell.

172
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:20,957
For starters.

173
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,767
Mmm-hmm.

174
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,427
You had an even bigger
agenda, didn't you, Mitch?

175
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,437
What did you think,

176
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,937
you were gonna jump from cell
to cell taking out terrorists?

177
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,407
Righting the world's wrongs?

178
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:33,067
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

179
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:35,507
I mean, it's more than
you accomplished.

180
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:37,647
I'm gonna let you
in on something.

181
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:40,507
Our people here, they don't
know what to do with you.

182
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:42,947
A lot of them think we should
just throw you in a supermax.

183
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:45,817
Me?

184
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,987
I like your agenda, Mitch.

185
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:51,687
I can help you with it,
if you throw in with us.

186
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,657
We can teach you how to
play with the big boys.

187
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:55,527
Yeah, let me stop
you right there.

188
00:18:55,557 --> 00:18:58,157
You don't think I considered
that 18 months ago?

189
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:00,827
Joining the CIA?

190
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:03,627
I made the decision to
pursue Mansur on my own

191
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,737
'cause I knew I could get it done.

192
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:09,907
What you need to understand
is that I'm the only way.

193
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:12,607
To get what you want.

194
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,977
Why the hell would I trust you?

195
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:16,817
Because I believe in you.

196
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:20,547
And I'm all you've got.

197
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:24,687
What's been confirmed is

198
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:26,227
the enriched plutonium
has been stolen

199
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:29,157
from a decommissioned
Russian nuclear facility.

200
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:31,227
If they get their hands
on a nuclear trigger

201
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,027
and a physicist to build it,

202
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:35,597
they'd be able to arm it and
detonate it at any time.

203
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:38,267
Tom?

204
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:49,137
He's testing through the roof.

205
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:51,237
Might be the best
I've ever seen.

206
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,577
We've had him under
surveillance for six months.

207
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,077
Martial arts, gun skills.

208
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:57,117
I've surveilled dozens
of these vigilantes.

209
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,517
This one is different.

210
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,247
Yeah, well, I've gone
over these, Irene.

211
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,587
He's noncompliant,
he's oppositional.

212
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:05,587
He got us into Mansur's cell.

213
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,587
That's a hell of a lot
more than we ever managed.

214
00:20:07,627 --> 00:20:08,896
All right, Orion is
an elite unit, Irene.

215
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:10,227
A secret unit.

216
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:12,867
Reports to you, me,
and no one else.

217
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:14,066
I don't want to be responsible

218
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,497
for that kind of mistake.

219
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:16,967
Now, that's Hurley talking.

220
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:18,937
Yeah, well, he's called
me twice about this.

221
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,907
This kind of psych profile
scares the hell out of him.

222
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,737
As far as he's concerned,

223
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:25,776
you're sending him a Section
8 with an ax to grind.

224
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,607
What happened to that
kid on the beach,

225
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:28,977
it changed him.

226
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:30,817
You can't train
that into someone.

227
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,677
His psych profile is exactly
what I've been looking for.

228
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:37,287
Polygraph?

229
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:38,557
Flying colors.

230
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,857
All right. Good
luck with Hurley.

231
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,857
Oh, Irene.

232
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,727
We'll have fresh
intel on the Russian

233
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:50,567
plutonium situation
in two hours.

234
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,027
Stay by your phone.

235
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,267
Yeah.

236
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,547
You can take the blindfold off.

237
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:16,927
So, what do I need to
know about this guy?

238
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,087
Stan Hurley.

239
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:20,187
He's a warrior.

240
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:21,787
Ex-Navy SEAL.

241
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,927
My daddy served with him
in the Persian Gulf.

242
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,147
Did you go through this program?

243
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:47,147
I went through a program.
Not this one.

244
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:49,177
It's not like becoming
a spy or Special Ops,

245
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:50,547
none of those things.

246
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,347
Good.

247
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:13,907
So, what are your goals, Mitch?

248
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:17,677
My goals?

249
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:19,376
My goal is to have them
lie awake at night,

250
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:20,847
knowing I'm coming for them.

251
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:53,307
I thought you were supposed
to be on the patch.

252
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:57,407
You saw those tests.

253
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,417
Yeah, I saw them.

254
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,917
He's off the charts.

255
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,017
I've seen off the charts before.

256
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,687
And he's got none
of the bad habits

257
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,717
he'd have to unlearn if
he had military training.

258
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:08,987
Unlearn?

259
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:10,857
Come on, Stan.

260
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,756
You drop one of your Navy
SEALs in an urban setting,

261
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,997
you can spot the boot
camp on them a mile away.

262
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,027
We're not fighting the...

263
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,697
Cold War?
Yeah, I know.

264
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,567
You keep telling me that,
Miss Deputy Director.

265
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:22,937
Oh, wow. "Miss
Deputy Director."

266
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:25,767
Your daddy would agree with me.

267
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,307
I'll be checking in with
you every 48 hours.

268
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,847
I'm on a plane to
London in the morning.

269
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,917
And go back on the
patch, for God's sake.

270
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:41,047
Don't prove me wrong.

271
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:50,357
She ain't coming back.

272
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:55,697
Hey.

273
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:57,967
Eyes front and center.

274
00:23:58,467 --> 00:24:00,197
Sorry.

275
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:02,336
"Sorry"? Do I look like one
of your college professors?

276
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:04,237
You talk to me, you
call me "sir," son.

277
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,277
Yes, sir.

278
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:15,177
What the fuck you doing here?

279
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:17,087
Did you have some bad
things happen to you,

280
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:19,087
some shitty things
happen to you?

281
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:22,057
Now you wanna kill those
mean old terrorists.

282
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,287
Go get some bad guys.

283
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,086
What makes you think
you can make it

284
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:27,297
through my selection process?

285
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,997
Permission to speak, sir?

286
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:30,867
Sure, go ahead if you
got something to say.

287
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:31,797
Like this is all a big mistake
and you wanna go home.

288
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:33,267
You wanna go home? Good.

289
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:34,336
Get the fuck out of here.
I'll drive you myself.

290
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:36,197
Not at all, sir.

291
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:38,397
I was gonna suggest we maybe
speed this whole thing up?

292
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:40,336
My guess is, if you and
I go hand-to-hand,

293
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:42,136
you could probably figure
out inside of 20 seconds

294
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:43,476
whether or not I have
what it takes to make it

295
00:24:43,477 --> 00:24:44,977
through your selection process.

296
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:47,247
So, what do you think?

297
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,487
We got an empty cot,
empty footlocker.

298
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:59,317
They're both yours as
long as you can last.

299
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:03,227
Sounds good.

300
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:04,997
Follow me.

301
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,257
See you out there.

302
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,566
Heard a lot about
you, by the way.

303
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,197
Excited to see what you got.

304
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:25,447
Kill me.

305
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,417
People think you can slice
a man's throat like this.

306
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:36,827
That's only in the movies.

307
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:38,287
Right there.

308
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:40,387
Do it.

309
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:42,457
No noise. No mess.

310
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,807
Victor, you're up.

311
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:06,847
What the fuck, man?

312
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,817
Who grabs a fucking blade?

313
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:28,937
Come on, you fuckin'
pussy. Let's go!

314
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,007
You gotta have eyes in
the back of your head.

315
00:26:43,617 --> 00:26:45,587
You flinch, you die.

316
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,357
Orion is about the mission.

317
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,587
It ain't about you.

318
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:59,197
You go down out there, you're
a ghost, you don't exist.

319
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:02,537
There's nobody, nobody
coming back for you.

320
00:27:07,937 --> 00:27:09,607
You're about to be captured.

321
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:15,617
Bye-bye.

322
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:26,457
We now know 15 kilos
of plutonium-239

323
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:28,327
went missing during
the Russian breach.

324
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:31,397
It's enough to build a
full-scale nuclear weapon.

325
00:27:31,427 --> 00:27:34,527
But that would likely require the
resources of a nation-state.

326
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,397
As Iranian Chief
of General Staff,

327
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:38,367
I share your concern.

328
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:41,337
We have been monitoring the
situation as you have.

329
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,367
I'm afraid we too
are in the dark.

330
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:45,407
For Iran, of course,

331
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:48,477
a nuclear weapon
is off the table.

332
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:51,107
We have a treaty.

333
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:54,477
You have countrymen who are
not too happy about that.

334
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:58,087
We monitor your nuclear enrichment
program pretty closely,

335
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:00,917
but black market
plutonium-239 from Russia...

336
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:03,657
Would be difficult for
inspectors to detect.

337
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,287
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

338
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,157
Mmm-hmm.

339
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,927
I assure you as
Minister of Defense

340
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:17,167
that we in Iran recognize how
much the spirit of comity

341
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:20,637
between our nations
would be compromised

342
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,537
if we were to acquire

343
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,707
weapons-grade plutonium
from any source.

344
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:27,307
Yes, it would.

345
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:29,977
Same goes for your
clients outside Iran,

346
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,547
Hezbollah. Hamas.

347
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,347
The Houthis.

348
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:38,187
Nuclear weapons are a danger
in any hands, Director.

349
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,157
Wasn't that your pretext
for your invasion

350
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:41,727
of our neighbor to the west?

351
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:44,257
One that cost
500,000 Iraqi lives

352
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:45,627
and left a wake of destruction

353
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,557
from which our region
has never recovered.

354
00:28:47,597 --> 00:28:51,067
General Rostami, we came only
to tell you what we know.

355
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,497
Is that a threat?

356
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:59,407
Of course not, Minister Behruz.

357
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:02,137
Gentlemen, I very much
appreciate you meeting with us.

358
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:03,607
Not at all.

359
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,077
I only wish we could
offer more insight.

360
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:07,317
Thank you.

361
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,597
I don't trust General Rostami.

362
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,367
We need to keep this quiet.

363
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,427
How ready is Orion?

364
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,367
I'll check in with Hurley.

365
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,767
Why is there no one on watch?

366
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:38,507
You're all dead.

367
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:40,747
Yeah, yeah.
I got it, I got it.

368
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:43,877
You're dead.

369
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:47,117
What?

370
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:50,087
You wanna say something to
me? Say it. Go on, say it.

371
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,427
You got 30 seconds!

372
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:02,167
These are your targets.

373
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:05,097
Memorize them.

374
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:08,637
It's your responsibility to
be able to identify them.

375
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:11,507
You shoot a combatant,
you get a point.

376
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,537
You miss, you get a shock.

377
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,507
You shoot a noncombatant,
you get a bigger shock.

378
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:19,047
Combatant shoots you...

379
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:20,547
Let's just say you're
gonna feel it.

380
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:22,747
Ready?

381
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:26,447
Go.

382
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:07,727
What's Hurley doing?

383
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:11,727
He's fucking with his head.

384
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,767
Fuck!

385
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:01,437
Fucking AR bullshit.

386
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:26,357
Shall we?

387
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:28,327
Okay.

388
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:29,827
That's clever.

389
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:35,397
Raw plutonium.

390
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:36,937
Highly enriched, as promised.

391
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,537
Let's hope.

392
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:48,147
Wow, that's a beautiful
sound, gentlemen.

393
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:50,277
May I?

394
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:53,857
Okay.

395
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,487
Wire the money.

396
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,917
That, I can do.

397
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:00,857
This is a cell phone.

398
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:19,237
Gotta move all the vans. The
Cardinal's visiting.

399
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:20,507
Okay.

400
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:21,987
Okay. Five minutes.

401
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,277
What's going on in there?

402
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,337
Souvenirs.

403
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,747
Possible code red,
backup needed.

404
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:31,997
There's nothing going on.

405
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:34,487
Come in.

406
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,786
It now appears that
all seven victims

407
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:10,417
were shot with a single weapon,

408
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:12,387
believed to be a Glock 29.

409
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,887
Traces of weaponized plutonium

410
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,457
were detected inside the van

411
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:17,027
where the bodies
of three Russians

412
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,497
and two Warsaw police
officers were found.

413
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:21,527
The Russian government
has confirmed

414
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:24,367
that the chemical footprint
of the plutonium in question

415
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,367
is a match to the
plutonium that was stolen

416
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:27,637
from the decommissioned

417
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:29,767
processing facility in Tobolsk.

418
00:34:29,807 --> 00:34:32,777
Security footage is being
analyzed by Polish police,

419
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:34,947
now working in conjunction
with Interpol,

420
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:37,007
to identify the shooter
and his connection

421
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:38,717
to the missing plutonium.

422
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:40,777
The identity of the shooter
remains unknown...

423
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:14,817
Hi, excuse me.

424
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:16,317
- How can I help you?
- Question.

425
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:05,797
May I help you?

426
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:07,027
No, thanks. I'm okay.

427
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,877
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

428
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,387
Rapp! God damn it!

429
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,516
You have to stay under control.

430
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:33,717
Dickhead!

431
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:35,387
Asshole doesn't
know when to quit.

432
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:37,387
You're kidding me, right?
I just saved your ass.

433
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,686
You've gotta know when the
mission's been accomplished, Rapp.

434
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,186
- Sir, he's a fucking...
- Which he did.

435
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:43,497
Never assume your target
is the only target.

436
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,526
The enemy dresses like a deer
and he kills like a lion.

437
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:46,727
And that's what we gotta do.

438
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,137
We just gotta do it better.

439
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:54,767
All right.

440
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:56,407
You're an asshole.

441
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:14,987
We got a problem.

442
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:16,557
Six weeks ago,
there was a breach

443
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:18,757
at a decommissioned Russian
plutonium facility.

444
00:37:19,957 --> 00:37:21,897
I'm aware.

445
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:24,527
What you don't know is 15 kilos
of plutonium went missing.

446
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:25,997
Weapons-grade.

447
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:27,937
That's a shit-ton
of plutonium.

448
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,167
And it just changed hands.

449
00:37:33,237 --> 00:37:35,177
I wanna show you something.

450
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:38,447
Take a look at this.

451
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:41,877
Does that face bong
a gong for you?

452
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,447
Or is it just me?

453
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:51,217
It can't be him.

454
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:53,757
Our drones took him out after
the embassy bombing at Bamako.

455
00:37:53,787 --> 00:37:55,657
We never got a positive ID.

456
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:57,697
That's our mad dog out there.

457
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,967
All right. Let's say it's him.

458
00:38:03,997 --> 00:38:05,697
It's him, Irene.

459
00:38:05,737 --> 00:38:08,067
This gives us a chance to kill
two birds with one stone.

460
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,577
Hamdi Sharif.

461
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,107
He's an arms dealer
working out of Turkey.

462
00:38:15,147 --> 00:38:17,977
Four days ago, he purchased a
Russian-designed nuclear trigger.

463
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:19,947
And he's gonna be selling it.

464
00:38:19,977 --> 00:38:21,577
Sharif's got the honey.

465
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:23,817
Now we just wait for the bee.

466
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:26,017
We go in, we fuck up their deal.

467
00:38:29,087 --> 00:38:30,287
And we take 'em both out.

468
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:36,527
You're going to Istanbul.

469
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:37,737
We have an agent in place.

470
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:38,926
She'll meet you at the airport.

471
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:40,667
All right.

472
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:42,997
Annika Ogden. We've had her
on the ground over there

473
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:45,137
for five years.

474
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:46,607
I want Rapp on the team.

475
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:48,877
Really?

476
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:50,077
He's ready, Stan.

477
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:52,507
Actually, Irene, he's not ready.

478
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:55,847
But he will be.

479
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:02,857
You wanted to see me, sir?

480
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,887
Yeah. Shut the door.

481
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,527
We're shipping out.

482
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,757
Set those down there.

483
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:14,357
You like movies?

484
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:16,227
Sure.

485
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:19,907
I got something for you.

486
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,037
What the fuck is this?

487
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,767
Yeah, I thought so.

488
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:23,957
You thought so?

489
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,107
Yeah.

490
00:39:25,137 --> 00:39:27,177
Why are you even alive, Rapp?

491
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,817
You ever asked yourself that?

492
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:36,047
Why you? You know,
of all those people?

493
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:37,747
You're special, I guess.

494
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:38,987
Oh, my God!

495
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:41,317
You want me to turn it up?

496
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:43,287
- I'll marry you!
- Take it!

497
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:46,327
You're a fucking coward, you
know that? Turn that shit off.

498
00:39:46,357 --> 00:39:48,327
What do you think?
It's my mom's ring.

499
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:49,967
You gonna turn it off?

500
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:52,297
Katrina!

501
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:58,007
Am I supposed to
feel sorry for you?

502
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:00,107
I don't.

503
00:40:13,117 --> 00:40:14,817
You made a big mistake.

504
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,957
You let emotion cloud
your judgment.

505
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:22,327
Never, ever let it get personal.

506
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:23,797
You understand?

507
00:40:38,137 --> 00:40:39,607
Yeah, I got it.

508
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,077
Be ready to go by 5:00.

509
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,347
See you at 4:30.

510
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,617
You know what you're
gonna do here?

511
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:55,667
No, sir.

512
00:40:55,677 --> 00:40:56,697
Correct. You don't.

513
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:58,226
So keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

514
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:59,427
And wait for my orders.

515
00:41:30,017 --> 00:41:34,287
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate
mogul/arms dealer.

516
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,627
He's like Santa Claus
for terrorists.

517
00:41:37,257 --> 00:41:38,997
Scumbag.

518
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:40,897
Spare me your
junior-year-abroad

519
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:42,667
moral opinion, would you, Rapp?

520
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:44,997
Not really an opinion, sir.
Sharif's a piece of shit.

521
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:46,397
It's not a crusade.

522
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,437
This mission is practical.
Don't make it...

523
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,767
Personal?

524
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:50,942
Exactly.

525
00:41:50,972 --> 00:41:52,107
Yes, sir.

526
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,907
Victor, you're with me.

527
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:56,007
Rapp, you and
Annika are eyes on.

528
00:41:57,947 --> 00:41:59,277
Sharif has a routine.

529
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,927
Let's see if anything
breaks his pattern.

530
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:02,887
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

531
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:04,917
All right, we got 48 hours.

532
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:07,287
Quick, clean. No footprint.

533
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,217
This town's ready
to blow as it is.

534
00:42:53,297 --> 00:42:55,027
Where the hell are you going?

535
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:07,767
Excuse me.

536
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:20,117
That was fucking reckless, Rapp.

537
00:43:20,157 --> 00:43:21,817
I took the initiative, sir.

538
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:23,497
- He could've been made.
- Well, I wasn't.

539
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:26,327
Here we go.

540
00:43:26,357 --> 00:43:27,927
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

541
00:43:27,957 --> 00:43:30,097
A meeting at a restaurant
on Akbiyik Street.

542
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:32,997
That's right before Sharif
goes to see his mistress.

543
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,467
That breaks his pattern.

544
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:36,057
I'll tell you what'll
break his pattern.

545
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:37,536
When that fucking
assistant tells his boss

546
00:43:37,537 --> 00:43:38,937
he lost his goddamn phone.

547
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:41,207
He won't.

548
00:43:41,237 --> 00:43:44,007
He's too afraid of Sharif to
let him know he screwed up.

549
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:46,007
All right. We go tomorrow.

550
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,307
What's the mission, sir?

551
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:49,146
Eliminate the target.
Eliminate the recipient.

552
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:50,287
Obtain the package.

553
00:43:50,317 --> 00:43:52,017
And what's the package?

554
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:53,247
We'll know it when we see it.

555
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:56,447
You're lead.

556
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:57,757
You're backup.

557
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:02,757
We will watch from
across the street.

558
00:44:03,957 --> 00:44:05,667
We get to play lovers.

559
00:44:27,527 --> 00:44:29,907
How long have you been married?

560
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:33,347
He thinks we're married.

561
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:42,257
Don't think too much.

562
00:44:42,297 --> 00:44:43,927
You'll lose your nerve.

563
00:44:44,627 --> 00:44:46,167
No, I don't think so.

564
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:49,567
It'll be your first time.

565
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:52,237
Yeah, not in my mind.

566
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,087
Lead, your friend's
arriving now.

567
00:45:16,127 --> 00:45:17,327
Copy.

568
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:29,507
And he brought a shitload
of military protection.

569
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:37,947
I'll take care of the MPs.

570
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:48,017
Oh, come on, now,
honey. Don't be mad.

571
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:49,917
No, no, no.

572
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:51,387
I had a few.
Yeah, I did.

573
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:52,947
I'll make it up to
you when I get home.

574
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,257
You know that.

575
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:05,047
Car bombing, near
Beylerbeyi Palace.

576
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:09,577
Call it in. Call it in, or
I'll cut your fucking throat.

577
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:40,297
Lead, you're a go.

578
00:46:40,337 --> 00:46:42,997
Survey 2, get in place.

579
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:44,357
- Be careful in there.
- I got it.

580
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,277
Pardon.

581
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:29,377
The nuclear trigger
is in the sedan.

582
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:14,157
Target's gone. Target's gone.

583
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:16,617
Get back!

584
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:18,387
Lead?

585
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:20,027
Dead.

586
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:23,227
Mission terminated.

587
00:48:23,257 --> 00:48:26,267
Exfil to secure
location. Confirm.

588
00:48:26,297 --> 00:48:30,667
Survey 2, you better let me
hear you fucking confirm.

589
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:33,737
God damn it, this is a fucking
mess. We're out of here.

590
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:42,287
Drive! Drive!

591
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:53,127
Follow your boss!

592
00:48:53,877 --> 00:48:56,257
Please, I'm just the assistant!

593
00:48:57,337 --> 00:48:58,797
Don't hurt me!

594
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:00,597
Drive! Drive!

595
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:05,007
He's there right now
on the fifth floor.

596
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:08,637
Please I don't approve
of what Sharif does.

597
00:49:13,147 --> 00:49:15,107
Don't kill me.

598
00:49:15,337 --> 00:49:17,207
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

599
00:49:18,607 --> 00:49:20,207
I'm gonna hurt your boss.

600
00:49:21,947 --> 00:49:23,827
The American mercenary
has the nuclear trigger.

601
00:49:24,737 --> 00:49:27,357
I've done my job. It's
your problem now.

602
00:50:03,717 --> 00:50:04,917
Shit.

603
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:14,127
Hurry up!

604
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:25,467
Come on, come on, come on.

605
00:50:35,677 --> 00:50:36,877
Come on.

606
00:52:32,287 --> 00:52:33,487
No, please.

607
00:52:34,517 --> 00:52:36,657
Please, don't. Don't.

608
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:40,757
No.

609
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:57,177
You disobeyed a direct order.

610
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:58,846
No, I made a decision
to pursue the target,

611
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:00,457
and I completed the mission.

612
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:02,426
And, sir, isn't that what I'm
here to do? Isn't that my job?

613
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:05,367
Your fucking job is to do what
I fucking tell you to do!

614
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:06,836
What, you prefer I
leave him alive, then,

615
00:53:06,837 --> 00:53:08,437
let him go? That
piece of shit?

616
00:53:12,277 --> 00:53:14,717
Stan?

617
00:53:14,747 --> 00:53:16,957
Good, you're here.
I wanna show you something.

618
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:18,187
Wait here.

619
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:22,447
Look at that. That's
the kind of bullshit

620
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:23,747
that could shut us down.

621
00:53:23,787 --> 00:53:25,857
Kid can't even follow
a fucking order.

622
00:53:25,997 --> 00:53:28,167
Victor got made. Rapp didn't.

623
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,497
Why does this kid give you
such a fucking hard-on?

624
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:32,497
Don't talk to me like
that! I'm your superior.

625
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:33,607
My superior, Irene?

626
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:35,037
Your superior, God damn it.

627
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:38,637
Do you have any idea how
long I spent looking

628
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:40,537
for someone with that
kid's talent and balls?

629
00:53:41,207 --> 00:53:42,647
Rapp stays.

630
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,147
You're giving me an order?

631
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:45,407
That's an affirmative.

632
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:48,717
Can you give us a minute?

633
00:53:52,547 --> 00:53:53,787
Look at this.

634
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:57,557
The trigger must have
been in that car.

635
00:54:01,627 --> 00:54:03,657
Look at him.

636
00:54:03,697 --> 00:54:04,997
Lookin' at me.

637
00:54:06,097 --> 00:54:08,067
Everything he did there,

638
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:09,567
I taught him how to do it.

639
00:54:09,597 --> 00:54:11,197
Stan.

640
00:54:11,237 --> 00:54:13,707
I should've left
him in the Navy.

641
00:54:13,737 --> 00:54:14,836
I'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch.

642
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:15,977
Stan, listen to me.

643
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:17,507
The only thing that matters now

644
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:19,006
is that fucking lunatic
has everything he needs

645
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:20,207
to build a nuclear weapon.

646
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:25,947
He's got a trigger. Now he
needs to buy a physicist.

647
00:54:25,977 --> 00:54:27,487
We just have to figure out

648
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:29,087
where they're gonna
build this thing.

649
00:54:29,117 --> 00:54:31,857
Ben.

650
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:34,827
That computer our boy Rapp
lifted from Sharif's house,

651
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:38,097
there's evidence of a $2 million
transfer to a bank account in Rome.

652
00:54:38,127 --> 00:54:39,857
Cash prepped for withdrawal.

653
00:54:39,897 --> 00:54:41,097
Rome.

654
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:06,107
Your money.

655
00:56:06,137 --> 00:56:09,677
I've been reading up, Minister.

656
00:56:09,707 --> 00:56:12,847
You Iranians probably all
learn this growing up,

657
00:56:12,877 --> 00:56:14,977
or at least you did before
you signed that treaty.

658
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:19,517
But me, I had no idea
about these fun facts.

659
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:23,247
Yeah, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

660
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:28,857
Inside three miles,
apparently you just vaporize.

661
00:56:28,897 --> 00:56:31,057
Some folks don't.

662
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:33,057
They get all black and charred,

663
00:56:33,097 --> 00:56:37,567
and dense as lead, and
no one knows why.

664
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:40,997
Inside five miles, everything
is sucked into a void,

665
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:43,237
hotter than the core of the sun.

666
00:56:46,177 --> 00:56:47,777
How about that?

667
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:51,137
Where's the rest?

668
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,847
You'll get the rest of your
money when the job's done.

669
00:56:57,287 --> 00:56:59,157
Where is my physicist?

670
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:01,817
He'll pick up his money,
then we'll pick him up.

671
00:57:01,997 --> 00:57:03,847
He's staying at a hotel in Rome.

672
00:57:04,157 --> 00:57:06,072
We'll need an extra day
to configure the weapon,

673
00:57:06,102 --> 00:57:06,957
then it's all yours.

674
00:57:06,997 --> 00:57:09,157
Kill as many Jews as you want.

675
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:16,167
Do you practice Salah, brother?

676
00:57:16,197 --> 00:57:19,737
I receive my payment,
complete the project.

677
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:23,277
That's my practice, brother.

678
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:24,577
Very well.

679
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:58,907
Who was that guy?

680
00:57:59,307 --> 00:58:00,807
In Istanbul.

681
00:58:03,177 --> 00:58:05,847
It seemed like he was
a step ahead of us.

682
00:58:08,787 --> 00:58:10,917
Hey, you gonna fill
me in here or what?

683
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:13,016
There's some bad people planning
on doing some bad things,

684
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:14,217
and it's our job to stop them.

685
00:58:17,187 --> 00:58:19,057
You still haven't said
anything about Victor.

686
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:21,757
Victor's gone. Victor
doesn't exist.

687
00:58:27,397 --> 00:58:29,837
What is it you think
we do here, Rapp?

688
00:58:33,137 --> 00:58:35,037
I think we kill people
who need to be killed.

689
00:58:35,067 --> 00:58:36,106
And who do you
trust to tell you?

690
00:58:36,107 --> 00:58:37,437
I follow orders.

691
00:58:37,477 --> 00:58:39,277
No, you follow orders
when they suit you.

692
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,807
This whole thing is pretty much

693
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:43,777
just a means to an end
for you, isn't it?

694
00:58:43,817 --> 00:58:45,217
A lot's happened
in my life, sir.

695
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:46,247
Really? Huh.

696
00:58:46,277 --> 00:58:47,277
Yeah.

697
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:48,747
So you think you were sent here

698
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:51,057
as an outlet for
your self-pity,

699
00:58:51,087 --> 00:58:54,187
and your anger, and all
your guilt. Right?

700
00:58:55,727 --> 00:58:57,727
Patriotism exists

701
00:58:57,757 --> 00:59:01,797
because people like you and people
like me need a higher cause.

702
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:04,127
Something bigger than us.

703
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,937
That stink coming outta you

704
00:59:05,967 --> 00:59:08,867
you like to call "revenge,"
the rest of us call "shit."

705
00:59:08,897 --> 00:59:10,417
And as soon as it
starts to feel good,

706
00:59:10,437 --> 00:59:12,237
that's when you stop
being a professional.

707
00:59:12,267 --> 00:59:13,707
And then what are you?

708
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:21,947
Tell us something good, darling.

709
00:59:21,977 --> 00:59:23,847
We're in their system.

710
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:29,957
The moment that transfer from
Sharif's account is picked up,

711
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,927
we'll know it.

712
00:59:31,957 --> 00:59:34,857
Boy, you just smile,
and the Red Sea parts.

713
00:59:36,297 --> 00:59:38,227
Works in the Med, too.

714
00:59:38,257 --> 00:59:40,497
I'll bet it does.

715
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:57,977
Cash withdrawal from Sharif's
account. $2 million, U.S.

716
01:00:37,177 --> 01:00:39,517
There's our
physicist. Let's go.

717
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:30,527
Welcome to the Boscolo
and enjoy your stay.

718
01:01:30,557 --> 01:01:32,267
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

719
01:01:40,637 --> 01:01:42,977
He's in 1448.

720
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:44,807
And we're next door.

721
01:02:14,207 --> 01:02:15,407
Code in.

722
01:02:15,437 --> 01:02:16,907
Victor-Charlie 1109.

723
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:18,507
Confirmed.

724
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:20,907
Suite 1448.
We're in 1449, right next door.

725
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:24,007
All right. We'll
grab the physicist,

726
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:26,207
and we'll take out
whosever coming for him.

727
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:27,877
Signal every 15 minutes.

728
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:10,647
Hey.

729
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:23,067
I know what happened to you.

730
01:03:24,227 --> 01:03:25,597
I'm sorry.

731
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:34,277
I understand you.

732
01:03:35,307 --> 01:03:37,007
More than you know.

733
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:52,257
I know what it's like to
lose people you love.

734
01:03:57,297 --> 01:03:59,627
We're gonna get these fuckers.

735
01:04:12,337 --> 01:04:13,537
Fuck!

736
01:04:17,277 --> 01:04:18,977
Where the hell are you?

737
01:04:39,327 --> 01:04:42,397
Hurley... Where is he?

738
01:04:43,807 --> 01:04:45,267
I don't know what
you're talking...

739
01:05:02,457 --> 01:05:03,657
Where is he?

740
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:05,617
He outside?

741
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:53,527
Please, no.

742
01:05:56,337 --> 01:05:57,537
Please.

743
01:06:00,337 --> 01:06:01,707
Hurley, what the fuck?

744
01:06:01,737 --> 01:06:03,206
I thought you were eyes on,
why didn't you spot 'em?

745
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,477
They were already
in the damn hotel.

746
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:07,107
Local mafia's working with 'em.

747
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,517
I'll tell Kennedy we
have the physicist.

748
01:06:23,157 --> 01:06:25,227
What the hell just
happened out there, huh?

749
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:27,297
That's twice now this guy's
blown up our entire op.

750
01:06:27,327 --> 01:06:29,697
What's the target? Huh?
What's the target?

751
01:06:29,727 --> 01:06:31,367
- I don't know, mister.
- Yeah, you do.

752
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:33,667
Huh?

753
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:35,137
Do you think I'm stupid?

754
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:36,506
He's an American.
He said your name.

755
01:06:36,507 --> 01:06:37,867
Did you train this guy?

756
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:39,607
You like to smoke?

757
01:06:39,637 --> 01:06:41,337
Oh, Jesus Christ!

758
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:43,207
- Are you a smoker?
- I don't...

759
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:44,637
- Wait!
- Bad habit.

760
01:06:44,677 --> 01:06:47,377
Wait, stop! Wait, wait!
I know something.

761
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:48,876
- What do you know?
- I know something.

762
01:06:48,877 --> 01:06:52,547
There is a man... There
is a man they call Ghost.

763
01:06:52,587 --> 01:06:56,487
Ghost. I think it was
an Iranian man said it.

764
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:57,564
Uh-huh.
Where are they building the bomb?

765
01:06:57,594 --> 01:06:57,926
I just...

766
01:06:57,927 --> 01:06:59,386
- Where are they building it?
- Took the money.

767
01:06:59,387 --> 01:07:01,157
Where are they building it?

768
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:03,157
All right, here. Take some
time to think about it.

769
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:06,467
Ghost. Is that his name?

770
01:07:07,767 --> 01:07:10,167
Why is this guy after you?

771
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:11,767
Something personal, sir?

772
01:07:11,797 --> 01:07:13,537
They're building a nuke.

773
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:18,577
Hotel Navona.

774
01:07:18,607 --> 01:07:20,407
- Clean yourself up.
- Wait.

775
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:23,507
Don't go.

776
01:07:23,547 --> 01:07:25,647
America's president has
ordered the Sixth Fleet

777
01:07:25,677 --> 01:07:27,917
out of the U.S. Naval
base in Naples, Italy.

778
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:30,547
The Sixth Fleet is now
southwest off the coast...

779
01:07:31,817 --> 01:07:33,157
Let me help you.

780
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:34,387
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

781
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,657
You're not.

782
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:55,637
How are you holding up?

783
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:01,747
I was afraid today.

784
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,617
I thought we were going to die.

785
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,887
Yeah, I'm either always
afraid or never afraid.

786
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:08,557
I don't know which.

787
01:08:25,437 --> 01:08:27,207
There you go.

788
01:08:33,737 --> 01:08:35,477
Just relax now.

789
01:08:39,277 --> 01:08:41,277
We'll search for Ghost tomorrow.

790
01:08:57,597 --> 01:08:58,797
You scared me.

791
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:00,727
Who are you?

792
01:09:00,767 --> 01:09:02,337
What do you mean?

793
01:09:02,367 --> 01:09:04,337
You said "Ghost."

794
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:05,527
What about him?

795
01:09:05,557 --> 01:09:06,737
I never told you that name.

796
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:07,977
Hurley did.

797
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:09,907
Yeah, I think you're
full of shit.

798
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,607
- Mitch.
- Who are you?

799
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,676
- Mitch, what's wrong with you?
- Who do you work for?

800
01:09:13,677 --> 01:09:15,317
I'm CIA.

801
01:09:15,347 --> 01:09:17,317
Now don't fucking lie to me!

802
01:09:17,347 --> 01:09:18,677
I'm not lying!

803
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,017
You're Iranian, aren't you?

804
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,517
Get the fuck away from me!

805
01:09:33,997 --> 01:09:35,527
Are you working
with the Iranians?

806
01:09:37,397 --> 01:09:39,597
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth!

807
01:09:41,327 --> 01:09:42,827
Go to hell!

808
01:09:52,077 --> 01:09:53,847
You Iranian intelligence?

809
01:09:53,877 --> 01:09:55,947
Are you Iranian intelligence?

810
01:10:04,557 --> 01:10:06,527
What do you know about Ghost?

811
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:28,307
We're gonna need the
decryption device.

812
01:10:34,347 --> 01:10:35,817
You were right, Mitch.

813
01:10:35,847 --> 01:10:38,457
This Iranian mole is a
tough nut to crack.

814
01:10:38,487 --> 01:10:40,320
All I could get from
her was her handler.

815
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:40,887
Azad Ashani.

816
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:42,056
Happens to be a friend of mine.

817
01:10:42,057 --> 01:10:43,427
I'm gonna go pay him a visit.

818
01:10:43,457 --> 01:10:44,647
Okay, I'm going with you.

819
01:10:44,677 --> 01:10:45,827
No.

820
01:10:45,857 --> 01:10:47,457
I need you to stay here.

821
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:49,027
Kennedy's on her way
with the CIA team

822
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:50,467
and a Mossad team.

823
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:51,766
She's gonna ask me
where you went.

824
01:10:51,767 --> 01:10:53,397
What the hell am I
supposed to say?

825
01:10:53,437 --> 01:10:54,736
That's right, she is. And
you're gonna be smart,

826
01:10:54,737 --> 01:10:55,766
and you're gonna keep
your mouth shut,

827
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:57,437
and you're gonna cover my ass.

828
01:11:21,497 --> 01:11:23,527
I still have it.

829
01:11:26,397 --> 01:11:27,897
Very nice.

830
01:11:29,697 --> 01:11:32,567
I am always happy to
meet you, Stan...

831
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:37,507
But never happy why.

832
01:11:37,537 --> 01:11:40,077
Well, maybe next time
we'll meet for pizza.

833
01:11:40,107 --> 01:11:41,377
Your girl's tough, by the way.

834
01:11:44,417 --> 01:11:46,017
Go easy on her.

835
01:11:46,047 --> 01:11:47,347
She's my niece.

836
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:49,987
Yeah.

837
01:11:57,587 --> 01:11:58,827
What have you got for me?

838
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:03,097
The men behind all this
are General Rostami,

839
01:12:03,127 --> 01:12:05,697
our military chief of staff,

840
01:12:05,727 --> 01:12:08,597
and our defense
minister, Behruz.

841
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:10,807
Both are very powerful,

842
01:12:10,837 --> 01:12:14,977
and both are very angry about the
nuclear treaty we made with you.

843
01:12:15,007 --> 01:12:16,877
They have been trying to acquire

844
01:12:16,907 --> 01:12:19,777
nuclear materials for
the past two years.

845
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,517
And they are the ones

846
01:12:21,547 --> 01:12:23,977
who hired the mercenary
called Ghost.

847
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:29,957
Rostami is now in Tehran,
but Behruz is here in Rome.

848
01:12:29,987 --> 01:12:34,927
Annika has been tracking his
movements through his cell phone.

849
01:12:34,957 --> 01:12:36,117
And they're building it here?

850
01:12:36,127 --> 01:12:37,827
I wish I knew.

851
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:40,597
We have their physicist.

852
01:12:40,627 --> 01:12:41,567
They can't build it without him.

853
01:12:41,597 --> 01:12:42,797
But...

854
01:12:44,097 --> 01:12:46,767
The mercenary asked Behruz

855
01:12:46,807 --> 01:12:49,637
to use one of ours, an Iranian.

856
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:53,437
Behruz agreed. That was rash.

857
01:12:53,477 --> 01:12:55,177
It means they are in a hurry.

858
01:12:58,047 --> 01:12:59,977
And the target's Israel?

859
01:13:00,017 --> 01:13:02,147
I wish I had better
information for you.

860
01:13:10,257 --> 01:13:11,827
Where the hell is Hurley?

861
01:13:11,857 --> 01:13:13,687
You gotta tell me what's
going on here. Now.

862
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,697
That guy he trained,
who the hell is he?

863
01:13:15,727 --> 01:13:17,596
That's not something you
need to know right now.

864
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:19,627
What are you covering up?

865
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,667
When you've got a level-5
security clearance

866
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,147
and 20 years'
experience, talk to me.

867
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,067
Until then, shut up
and do your job.

868
01:13:30,137 --> 01:13:33,177
I want her cell phone
decrypted and scanned.

869
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:35,046
Local PD pulled a body from
the harbor an hour ago.

870
01:13:35,047 --> 01:13:36,577
Gunshot to the chest.

871
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:38,717
Iranian intelligence
officer, Azad Ashani.

872
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,987
Christ!

873
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:43,017
That's the guy
Hurley went to meet.

874
01:13:43,047 --> 01:13:44,787
Stupid son of a bitch!

875
01:13:44,817 --> 01:13:46,586
All right, so what do we
do? We gotta go after him.

876
01:13:46,587 --> 01:13:48,787
There's a fucking
nuke in play, Rapp.

877
01:13:48,827 --> 01:13:52,097
That's the mission,
and the only mission.

878
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,867
This is now a joint
CIA-Mossad operation,

879
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,167
whether we like it or not.

880
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,707
Can you get the
Director on the phone?

881
01:13:56,727 --> 01:13:58,797
So you're just gonna
write him off then?

882
01:13:58,837 --> 01:14:00,667
That's the plan?

883
01:14:00,697 --> 01:14:02,867
Stan Hurley is the closest
thing to family I've got.

884
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,066
And if he were standing
here right now,

885
01:14:04,067 --> 01:14:05,707
his only question would be,

886
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:07,617
why are we wasting our
breath talking about him?

887
01:14:09,047 --> 01:14:10,247
You're through here.

888
01:14:10,277 --> 01:14:11,807
You're going home,
that's an order.

889
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:15,217
Now, sit down and shut up.

890
01:15:06,827 --> 01:15:08,897
Why are you helping me?

891
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,867
Your handler Ashani was killed.

892
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:12,727
Hurley was with him.
Something happened.

893
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,967
I'm going after him.

894
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:17,837
I need your help.

895
01:15:19,877 --> 01:15:21,077
We gotta go.

896
01:15:46,867 --> 01:15:48,897
Stan.

897
01:15:48,937 --> 01:15:50,967
I've looked forward to this.

898
01:15:50,997 --> 01:15:52,897
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

899
01:15:54,237 --> 01:15:55,977
I wanna show you something.

900
01:15:56,007 --> 01:15:57,207
All right.

901
01:16:09,887 --> 01:16:11,617
Savages. Right, Stan?

902
01:16:13,817 --> 01:16:16,027
But you know something?
I don't blame them.

903
01:16:17,197 --> 01:16:18,397
I blame you.

904
01:16:18,427 --> 01:16:19,957
Never would've happened

905
01:16:19,987 --> 01:16:21,196
if you would have
followed orders, Ronnie.

906
01:16:21,197 --> 01:16:23,197
"You go down out there,
you're a ghost."

907
01:16:23,227 --> 01:16:24,727
"You're a John Doe."

908
01:16:24,767 --> 01:16:27,197
"You get captured?"

909
01:16:27,237 --> 01:16:29,367
Oh, you remember.
That's very gratifying.

910
01:16:29,397 --> 01:16:30,407
Thank you.

911
01:16:30,437 --> 01:16:32,107
You made me proud today, Ron.

912
01:16:34,337 --> 01:16:36,177
You should've come for me.

913
01:16:37,947 --> 01:16:39,147
Ten men would've died.

914
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:40,707
You put 10 men's
lives in danger,

915
01:16:40,747 --> 01:16:42,747
'cause you couldn't
follow a fucking order.

916
01:16:42,777 --> 01:16:44,047
- Fuck you.
- Fuck orders.

917
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:45,787
- Fuck the mission!
- Fuck you.

918
01:16:45,817 --> 01:16:48,147
This was me. I was your
boy, I believe that.

919
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,387
You made me believe that.

920
01:16:59,897 --> 01:17:01,857
Ashani had their people
tracking Minister Behruz's

921
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,067
secure cell phone.

922
01:17:04,397 --> 01:17:06,097
So, we find Behruz,
we find Hurley.

923
01:17:15,947 --> 01:17:17,207
Mitch!

924
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:07,387
Oh, yeah, look at that.

925
01:18:07,427 --> 01:18:09,087
Did you learn that in Aleppo?

926
01:18:09,127 --> 01:18:10,427
No.

927
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:12,697
You always told us
what to expect, Stan.

928
01:18:17,997 --> 01:18:20,837
Now, where's the
rest of your team?

929
01:18:22,067 --> 01:18:23,867
Come on, Ronnie, really?

930
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,776
Don't call me that. Where's
the rest of your team?

931
01:18:25,777 --> 01:18:27,937
Your new boy out
there, he on my tail?

932
01:18:27,977 --> 01:18:31,407
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
There's your first mistake.

933
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:34,417
You never start with
a real question.

934
01:18:34,447 --> 01:18:36,747
You start slow.

935
01:18:36,787 --> 01:18:38,247
You get inside your
subject's head.

936
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:42,187
Stan, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

937
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:45,057
There's your second
mistake. Number two.

938
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:47,527
You don't say, "one more
time." You already...

939
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:49,757
Damn!

940
01:18:52,897 --> 01:18:55,997
Now, what's that
third mistake, Stan?

941
01:18:56,037 --> 01:18:57,967
Huh? What is it?

942
01:18:57,997 --> 01:18:59,907
Go ahead! Go ahead!

943
01:18:59,937 --> 01:19:02,407
I got nine more! I like this.

944
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:04,837
I like it. Go
ahead, bring it on!

945
01:19:04,877 --> 01:19:06,077
You motherfucker!

946
01:19:08,907 --> 01:19:11,277
Ronnie wants to know
if I got a team outside.

947
01:19:11,307 --> 01:19:12,447
Right, Ron?

948
01:19:12,477 --> 01:19:14,047
If it's safe to move your bomb.

949
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:17,987
Are we being followed?

950
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,217
Where's the new me?

951
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:23,827
I've done my research.
I know all about him.

952
01:19:23,857 --> 01:19:26,327
"The new me..." Oh,
you mean Mitch?

953
01:19:26,357 --> 01:19:29,027
You know, Mitch,
he's unpredictable.

954
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:30,297
You never know about Mitch.

955
01:19:30,327 --> 01:19:31,897
He might be here,
he might be there.

956
01:19:31,937 --> 01:19:33,536
He's like you, but
you're a real Section 8.

957
01:19:33,537 --> 01:19:34,567
Enough.

958
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:35,752
Schizo mom.

959
01:19:35,782 --> 01:19:36,937
Where are they?

960
01:19:36,967 --> 01:19:38,437
- Loser dad.
- Where are they?

961
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:41,937
God!

962
01:19:45,277 --> 01:19:46,847
Where's the rest of your team?

963
01:19:46,877 --> 01:19:48,317
Half-wit mom, psycho dad...

964
01:19:48,347 --> 01:19:49,547
Where's the rest of your team?

965
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:51,077
- You're pond scum.
- Where are they?

966
01:19:51,117 --> 01:19:53,317
Pond scum! You're fucking...

967
01:20:03,927 --> 01:20:05,357
I'm sorry about your handler.

968
01:20:06,227 --> 01:20:07,967
Ashani was my uncle.

969
01:20:10,237 --> 01:20:11,937
I'm sure it was Minister Behruz

970
01:20:11,967 --> 01:20:14,837
and General Rostami
who had him killed.

971
01:20:14,867 --> 01:20:17,537
They want nuclear
war with Israel.

972
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:19,407
We tried to stop them.

973
01:20:19,437 --> 01:20:22,307
My brother and father
both died fighting them.

974
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:27,147
Corviale. Turn here.

975
01:20:31,647 --> 01:20:33,987
You know what my
real mistake was?

976
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:37,287
I trusted you.

977
01:20:37,327 --> 01:20:40,327
You made me feel like I
was the Second Coming.

978
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:44,127
And you acted like my father.

979
01:20:47,037 --> 01:20:50,567
I trusted you and I trusted
the United States Navy.

980
01:20:59,277 --> 01:21:02,547
U.S. of A. Does it, it's
gotta be good. Right, Stan?

981
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:04,617
Except

982
01:21:04,647 --> 01:21:08,017
nobody told me the business
y'all are really in.

983
01:21:11,287 --> 01:21:13,157
You create monsters.

984
01:21:13,187 --> 01:21:14,487
That's just what you do.

985
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:18,257
Those people who did this to me,

986
01:21:18,297 --> 01:21:20,457
you think they're barbarians?

987
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,367
Bullshit.

988
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:32,277
Where's the decryption
I asked for?

989
01:21:32,307 --> 01:21:35,007
Rapp grabbed her smartphone
before we could get any of it.

990
01:21:35,047 --> 01:21:37,177
And we can't find him.

991
01:21:37,207 --> 01:21:39,017
Surveillance cameras
picked up Rapp

992
01:21:39,047 --> 01:21:41,077
taking out our agents
five minutes ago.

993
01:21:44,317 --> 01:21:46,187
What the hell are you doing?

994
01:21:54,427 --> 01:21:56,357
There's not a single
thing happening here

995
01:21:56,397 --> 01:21:57,597
that you didn't make happen.

996
01:22:00,597 --> 01:22:03,167
God bless fucking
America, huh, Stan?

997
01:22:04,737 --> 01:22:05,937
Hoorah!

998
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:08,977
Hoorah!

999
01:22:10,237 --> 01:22:12,107
I can tell you where Mitch is...

1000
01:22:12,137 --> 01:22:14,677
What's that third mistake, Stan?

1001
01:22:14,707 --> 01:22:17,047
Mitch... I can't hear you.

1002
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:19,347
Fuck!

1003
01:22:24,617 --> 01:22:28,327
Third mistake, never
get too close.

1004
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:30,287
Finish your personal
business here.

1005
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:31,997
Your work is done.

1006
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:33,427
The bomb is armed.

1007
01:22:33,457 --> 01:22:34,727
- Timer is set up?
- Yes.

1008
01:22:34,757 --> 01:22:36,167
He's playing you.

1009
01:22:36,197 --> 01:22:38,397
Bomb's not for
you, it's for him.

1010
01:22:38,427 --> 01:22:39,997
It was his plan all along!

1011
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:13,427
Dead zone.

1012
01:23:13,467 --> 01:23:15,727
We're not getting
any signals here.

1013
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:23,277
Come on. Come on.

1014
01:23:27,347 --> 01:23:29,107
Wait a second.

1015
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:55,267
What are you gonna do with it?

1016
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:56,667
No, Stan.

1017
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,437
"What are we gonna
do with it?"

1018
01:24:02,607 --> 01:24:04,707
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

1019
01:24:05,447 --> 01:24:07,347
I like Rome.

1020
01:24:07,377 --> 01:24:08,577
It's good food.

1021
01:24:13,347 --> 01:24:16,617
Never, ever thought
I'd die in the field.

1022
01:24:17,857 --> 01:24:20,057
Ain't it crazy?

1023
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:23,097
I always figured it
would be, I don't know,

1024
01:24:23,127 --> 01:24:27,467
some cabin in the
woods with my dog.

1025
01:24:27,497 --> 01:24:29,197
Me?

1026
01:24:29,227 --> 01:24:31,467
I think I want water.

1027
01:24:31,497 --> 01:24:34,607
There's just something
peaceful about dying at sea.

1028
01:24:39,477 --> 01:24:40,677
All right.

1029
01:24:43,147 --> 01:24:44,447
Let's get it over with.

1030
01:24:44,477 --> 01:24:46,577
No, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1031
01:24:46,617 --> 01:24:47,817
I ain't gonna kill you.

1032
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,087
You're gonna live to see

1033
01:24:50,117 --> 01:24:52,087
the crown of your
creation, Stan.

1034
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:56,257
Thousands of Americans
are gonna burn.

1035
01:24:57,157 --> 01:24:59,087
All because of you.

1036
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:02,227
Enjoy the show.

1037
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:05,327
Get ready.

1038
01:25:45,537 --> 01:25:46,737
Go.

1039
01:26:58,267 --> 01:26:59,737
Please help me.

1040
01:27:00,837 --> 01:27:02,537
Annika.

1041
01:27:06,037 --> 01:27:08,037
Your family were
very well respected.

1042
01:27:08,917 --> 01:27:10,787
They were my friends.

1043
01:27:13,587 --> 01:27:14,787
Bastard.

1044
01:27:16,257 --> 01:27:18,047
I knew them very well.

1045
01:27:18,517 --> 01:27:19,897
Please I beg you.

1046
01:27:20,487 --> 01:27:21,687
Whoa!

1047
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,257
We've got an explosion detected.

1048
01:28:35,717 --> 01:28:37,317
Here.

1049
01:28:37,357 --> 01:28:39,417
A half click off the
Fiumicino waterways.

1050
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:41,827
It's underground.

1051
01:28:41,857 --> 01:28:43,657
- Delta One, go!
- Let's go.

1052
01:28:43,697 --> 01:28:45,427
Get a chopper out there.

1053
01:29:16,987 --> 01:29:18,727
You're not supposed
to be here, Rapp.

1054
01:29:18,757 --> 01:29:20,697
Yeah, what are you
gonna do, fire me?

1055
01:29:20,727 --> 01:29:23,327
There's another passage down
there. He's got the nuke.

1056
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:24,427
You gonna be good?

1057
01:29:24,457 --> 01:29:25,657
Go. Go!

1058
01:30:05,037 --> 01:30:06,867
Put the gun down.

1059
01:30:06,897 --> 01:30:08,637
Or she's dead.

1060
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:12,707
I want to see my family, Mitch.

1061
01:30:13,707 --> 01:30:16,607
No, Annika, you don't.

1062
01:30:16,647 --> 01:30:18,047
I want to see my family.

1063
01:30:18,077 --> 01:30:20,147
Come on, Mitch. Be nice.

1064
01:30:20,177 --> 01:30:21,817
She wants to live.

1065
01:30:21,847 --> 01:30:23,747
She wants to see her family.

1066
01:30:23,787 --> 01:30:25,447
Put the gun down.

1067
01:30:28,717 --> 01:30:29,917
Annika!

1068
01:32:27,097 --> 01:32:28,827
The bomb can't be stopped.

1069
01:32:28,857 --> 01:32:30,527
Just like you couldn't stop

1070
01:32:30,567 --> 01:32:32,867
that beautiful girl from
dying on the beach.

1071
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:38,967
Irene.

1072
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:41,807
The bomb's on a boat.

1073
01:32:41,837 --> 01:32:43,137
Hurley?

1074
01:32:43,177 --> 01:32:44,737
How do you know?

1075
01:32:44,777 --> 01:32:46,977
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

1076
01:32:51,177 --> 01:32:53,187
Is the Sixth Fleet
out on maneuvers?

1077
01:32:55,687 --> 01:32:56,887
Oh, my God.

1078
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:58,217
Bring up ISR feeds.

1079
01:32:58,257 --> 01:32:59,826
Get me eyes in the sky
over the coastline

1080
01:32:59,827 --> 01:33:02,757
and put the Sixth Fleet
on nuclear alert.

1081
01:33:02,797 --> 01:33:04,827
Tom.

1082
01:33:04,857 --> 01:33:07,527
The target is the Sixth Fleet
and it's 25 miles offshore.

1083
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:16,307
It's a shame.

1084
01:33:16,337 --> 01:33:20,847
The last thing your girl saw
was you not saving her.

1085
01:33:32,657 --> 01:33:33,857
General quarters.

1086
01:33:33,887 --> 01:33:35,787
All hands, man your stations.

1087
01:33:35,817 --> 01:33:38,787
This is not a drill. I
repeat, this is not a drill.

1088
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:41,657
Inbound, small vessel-borne
nuclear device.

1089
01:33:41,697 --> 01:33:43,097
Man decon stations.

1090
01:33:48,097 --> 01:33:50,667
Didn't Hurley teach you anything,
little brother?

1091
01:33:56,337 --> 01:33:58,947
To never make it personal.

1092
01:34:10,047 --> 01:34:11,357
This isn't personal.

1093
01:34:19,257 --> 01:34:20,457
Shit.

1094
01:34:21,927 --> 01:34:25,197
The bomb has a timer
and a release trigger.

1095
01:34:25,237 --> 01:34:27,837
We take out his boat,
it'll detonate.

1096
01:34:27,867 --> 01:34:29,837
If it goes off above
the waterline...

1097
01:34:29,867 --> 01:34:30,368
Disaster.

1098
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,737
There'll be fallout
all over the mainland.

1099
01:34:36,147 --> 01:34:39,147
USS Flynn... Prepare to engage.

1100
01:34:50,087 --> 01:34:51,387
The boat is turning, sir.

1101
01:34:51,427 --> 01:34:53,087
Who's driving that boat?

1102
01:34:56,427 --> 01:34:57,627
Rapp.

1103
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:01,867
Go.

1104
01:35:01,897 --> 01:35:03,797
- Sir?
- Go!

1105
01:35:11,237 --> 01:35:14,007
What are you doing? Hurley.

1106
01:35:14,047 --> 01:35:16,147
Hurley?

1107
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:17,716
Trying to get our boy to
throw the bomb in the water.

1108
01:35:17,717 --> 01:35:20,277
Flynn, you are clear
to fire when ready.

1109
01:35:20,317 --> 01:35:23,247
Do not fire, Commander.
The boat is turning.

1110
01:35:23,287 --> 01:35:26,257
If we don't engage, that
guarantees detonation.

1111
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:27,427
I understand there's a risk,

1112
01:35:27,457 --> 01:35:28,987
but this is the best
chance we've got.

1113
01:35:29,027 --> 01:35:31,027
Shit! God damn it!

1114
01:35:39,027 --> 01:35:40,897
There he is.

1115
01:35:40,937 --> 01:35:42,997
Get me on that boat's
marine bandwidth.

1116
01:35:46,877 --> 01:35:48,077
Rapp!

1117
01:35:48,477 --> 01:35:50,147
Rapp!

1118
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:52,777
Can you hear me?
Pick up the radio!

1119
01:35:52,807 --> 01:35:55,717
Throw the bomb overboard!

1120
01:35:55,747 --> 01:35:57,917
No way, sir, I gotta get
further away from the fleet!

1121
01:35:57,947 --> 01:35:59,317
Rapp!

1122
01:35:59,347 --> 01:36:02,117
For once in your life,
take a goddamn order!

1123
01:36:02,157 --> 01:36:04,017
The Sixth Fleet is about
to blow you to hell!

1124
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:18,837
Command, Delta Two, the
bomb's in the water.

1125
01:36:18,867 --> 01:36:21,037
Commander, hold your fire!
The bomb's in the water.

1126
01:36:21,067 --> 01:36:23,007
Flynn, hold fire!

1127
01:36:23,037 --> 01:36:25,677
Hold fire!

1128
01:36:55,537 --> 01:36:57,497
Got less than 30 seconds.

1129
01:37:01,377 --> 01:37:02,577
All right, go! Get outta here!

1130
01:37:23,097 --> 01:37:24,297
Jesus.

1131
01:38:04,457 --> 01:38:06,297
Brace for impact.

1132
01:38:06,327 --> 01:38:07,797
Sir, yes, sir!

1133
01:38:12,067 --> 01:38:14,537
Holy shit.

1134
01:38:55,107 --> 01:38:56,307
Hold on!

1135
01:39:09,187 --> 01:39:10,517
Brace!

1136
01:39:51,687 --> 01:39:53,427
You shouldn't have come for me.

1137
01:39:55,397 --> 01:39:57,467
Don't get used to it, son.

1138
01:39:59,567 --> 01:40:02,197
Hurley...

1139
01:40:02,237 --> 01:40:04,537
Looks like we're gonna
be all right up here.

1140
01:40:05,367 --> 01:40:06,567
I think.

1141
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:13,977
Damage control
central. Report.

1142
01:40:14,007 --> 01:40:15,347
Pressure is normalizing.

1143
01:40:15,377 --> 01:40:17,547
We have multiple hull breaches.

1144
01:40:17,577 --> 01:40:19,387
Radiologicals, Eisenhower?

1145
01:40:19,417 --> 01:40:21,247
Low... Low levels.

1146
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:24,957
Initiating countermeasure
wash-down.

1147
01:40:24,987 --> 01:40:26,687
Commander, any casualties?

1148
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:28,657
The Flynn took some
serious damage.

1149
01:40:28,687 --> 01:40:30,627
The casualty reports
aren't in yet,

1150
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:33,667
but if it had gone off above the waterline,
I don't think we'd be here.

1151
01:40:33,697 --> 01:40:35,267
Eisenhower,

1152
01:40:36,297 --> 01:40:38,437
my prayers are with you all.

1153
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:02,217
Hurley, is Rapp there?

1154
01:41:03,187 --> 01:41:04,387
Hold on a minute.

1155
01:41:09,457 --> 01:41:10,657
Yeah, go ahead.

1156
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:12,327
You okay, Mitch?

1157
01:41:12,367 --> 01:41:14,097
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

1158
01:41:19,207 --> 01:41:21,237
You saved a lot of lives today.

1159
01:41:23,037 --> 01:41:24,577
Took some losses, too.

1160
01:42:28,637 --> 01:42:31,397
What the hell are
you looking at?

1161
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:33,237
You look like a mummy.

1162
01:42:33,267 --> 01:42:34,607
Yeah.

1163
01:42:34,637 --> 01:42:36,667
Well...

1164
01:42:36,707 --> 01:42:38,807
A mummy doesn't have
to write up reports.

1165
01:42:38,837 --> 01:42:41,347
Dictate them. You
should be good at that.

1166
01:42:43,447 --> 01:42:45,147
Iranian official,
General Rostami,

1167
01:42:45,177 --> 01:42:47,147
the leader of the minority
opposition in Tehran,

1168
01:42:47,187 --> 01:42:49,517
claims that he has proof
that a secret group

1169
01:42:49,547 --> 01:42:51,787
of assassins within
America's CIA

1170
01:42:51,817 --> 01:42:54,557
are responsible for last
week's nuclear event.

1171
01:42:54,587 --> 01:42:56,427
With the Iranian
presidential election

1172
01:42:56,457 --> 01:42:58,157
just two weeks away,

1173
01:42:58,197 --> 01:43:01,527
General Rostami continues
to rise in popularity.

1174
01:43:01,557 --> 01:43:03,167
They say General Rostami is

1175
01:43:03,197 --> 01:43:04,837
gonna be the next
President of Iran.

1176
01:43:04,867 --> 01:43:06,667
Yeah.

1177
01:43:06,697 --> 01:43:08,566
He didn't even have to blow
up Israel to get there.

1178
01:43:08,567 --> 01:43:10,537
He's gonna be a major
pain in the ass, too.

1179
01:43:10,567 --> 01:43:13,137
Where's Rapp? I
can't reach him.

1180
01:43:13,177 --> 01:43:14,807
How the hell do I
know where Rapp is?

1181
01:43:14,837 --> 01:43:16,377
I'm a mummy in a hospital.

1182
01:43:16,407 --> 01:43:18,677
Rostami has full support
for restarting.

1183
01:43:18,707 --> 01:43:20,547
Iran's nuclear program.

1184
01:43:23,577 --> 01:43:40,577
