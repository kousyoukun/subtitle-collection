What have you got for me?

907
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:48,410
The men behind all this
are General Rostami,

908
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,920
our military
chief of staff,

909
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,800
and our defense minister,
Behruz.

910
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,050
Both are very powerful,

911
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,260
and both are very angry about
the nuclear treaty we made with you.

912

trying to acquire

nuclear materials
for the past two years.

914
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,310
And they are the ones

915
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,270

called Ghost.

916

Rostami is now in Tehran,
but Behruz is here in Rome.

his movements through his cell phone.

building it here?

923
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:32,000
The mercenary asked Behruz

924
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,830
to use one of ours,
an Iranian.

925
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,590
Behruz agreed.
That was rash.

926
