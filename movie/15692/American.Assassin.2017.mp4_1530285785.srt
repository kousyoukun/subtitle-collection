144
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,400
他們這樣的人
I think people like that deserve to die

145
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,530
就得讓他們死的很難看
in the worst ways you can imagine.

146
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,600
關於你父母的死 你還記得多少
What do you remember about your parents' death?

147
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,700
那是一場車禍
Car crash.

148
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,140
我當時在馬薩諸塞州
I was in Massachusetts.

149
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,670
他們在突尼斯
They were in Tunisia at the time.

150
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,200
當時14歲
I was 14.

151
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,610
我只記得這些
That's what I remember.

152
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,840
你的行為舉止方面有些問題
You started having discipline problems.

153
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,140
曾被三個寄宿學校退學
Got yourself kicked out of three boarding schools.

154
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,080
我知道 只是不知道為什麼會這樣
Yeah, yeah. I know. I wonder what that was about.

155
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,350
談談那個沙灘上發生的事
Let's talk about what happened after that day on the beach.

156
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,320
我的天 又談這個 你在逗我麼?
Oh, Jesus Christ. Again? Are you kidding me?

157
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,390
是的 又談這個
Yeah, again.

158
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,460
你在那之後是不是就自暴自棄了
You gave up everything after that, didn't you?

159
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,630
你本科在布朗大學就讀
Your grad studies at Brown University.

160
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,070
我失去了興趣
I must have lost interest.

161
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,470
對一切都失去了興趣?
In everything?

162
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,270
不 不是這樣
No, not everything.

163
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,150
再見 費雷恩博士
See you later, Dr. Frain.

164
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,450
明天 同一時間見面麼
See you tomorrow, same time?

165
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,490
換個新面孔來見你
I like the new look.

166
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,760
我是艾琳·肯尼迪
Irene Kennedy, CIA Deputy Director

167
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,260
中情局反恐部副主任
in charge of Counterterrorism.

168
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,730
我知道你是誰
I know who you are.

169
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,500
你知道你在這呆了多久麼
Any idea how long you been here?

170
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,900
30天
30 days.

171
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,610
夠你想通一些事了
Enough time for you to figure out a couple things.

172
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,180
是啊 關於我自己的事 我想通了不少
Yeah, yeah. I've figured out a lot about myself.

173
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,250
過的很充實 謝謝
It's been a very reflective time. Thank you.

174
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,680
當時在現場你可能撐不過20秒
You wouldn't have made it through the next 20 seconds there alive.

175
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,390
天知道呢
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

176
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,790
你告訴費雷恩博士 說你要殺掉曼蘇爾
You told Dr. Frain you thought you were gonna kill Mansur

177
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,490
掃平他的老巢
and wipe out his whole cell.

178
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
這只是個開始
For starters.

179
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,190
米奇 你心裏還打著更大的算盤吧
You had an even bigger agenda, didn't you, Mitch?

180
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,200
你是怎麼想的
What did you think,

181
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,700
你想一個又一個掃平恐怖分子的據點?
you were gonna jump from cell to cell taking out terrorists?

182
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,170
鏟奸除惡?
Righting the world's wrongs?

183
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,830
我這不是搞定了曼蘇爾麼
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

184
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,270
比你有能耐啊
I mean, it's more than you accomplished.

185
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,410
我要跟你說一些事
I'm gonna let you in on something.

186
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,270
我們這的人不知道要拿你怎麼辦
Our people here, they don't know what to do with you.

187
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,710
很多人就覺得把你扔進一個高級別監獄就行了
A lot of them think we should just throw you in a supermax.

188
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,580
至於我嘛
Me?

189
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,750
米奇 我對你的計劃很感興趣
I like your agenda, Mitch.

190
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,450
如果你加入我們 我可以幫你實現你的目標
I can help you with it, if you throw in with us.

191
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,420
我們甚至可以把你培養成專業的特工
We can teach you how to play with the big boys.

192
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,290
讓我先打斷你一下
Yeah, let me stop you right there.

193
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,920
您認為我18個月前沒考慮過
You don't think I considered that 18 months ago?

194
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,590
加入中情局麼
Joining the CIA?

195
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,390
我覺得自己一個人行動幹掉曼蘇爾
I made the decision to pursue Mansur on my own

196
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,500
是因為我覺得我自己能辦到
'cause I knew I could get it done.

197
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,670
你要明白 只有我才能幫你
What you need to understand is that I'm the only way.

198
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,370
達成你的目的
To get what you want.

199
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,740
為什麼我要相信你
Why the hell would I trust you?

200
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,580
因為我相信你
Because I believe in you.

201
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,310
你只能指望我了
And I'm all you've got.

202
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,450
已確認
What's been confirmed is

203
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,990
一個退役的俄國
the enriched plutonium has been stolen

204
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,920
核設施裏的濃縮鈾遭竊
from a decommissioned Russian nuclear facility.

205
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,990
如果他們找到一個核起爆器
If they get their hands on a nuclear trigger

206
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,790
再找一個能造核彈的物理學家
and a physicist to build it,

207
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,360
他們就能裝備核武器 引爆核彈
they'd be able to arm it and detonate it at any time.

208
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,860
湯姆?
Tom?

209
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,900
他的測試結果十分優秀
He's testing through the roof.

210
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,000
我從沒見過這麼厲害的
Might be the best I've ever seen.

211
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,340
我們監控了他6個月
We've had him under surveillance for six months.

212
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,840
關注了他的格鬥術 槍法
Martial arts, gun skills.

213
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
我以前監控過不少這種民間人員
I've surveilled dozens of these vigilantes.

214
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,280
他很與眾不同
This one is different.

215
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,010
艾琳 這些情況我都清楚
Yeah, well, I've gone over these, Irene.

216
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,350
他不服從命令 難以控制
He's noncompliant, he's oppositional.

217
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,350
我們跟著他找到了曼蘇爾的老巢
He got us into Mansur's cell.

218
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,350
比我們強太多了
That's a hell of a lot more than we ever managed.

219
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,630
獵戶星是我們這的
All right, Orion is an elite unit, Irene.

220
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,990
秘密精英特種部隊
A secret unit.

221
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,630
只向你我二人報告
Reports to you, me, and no one else.

222
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,800
我不想為這人
I don't want to be responsible

223
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,260
可能鬧出的亂子負責
for that kind of mistake.

224
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,730
你說話的語氣和赫爾利一樣啊
Now, that's Hurley talking.

225
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,700
他給我打了兩次電話 就談這個
Yeah, well, he's called me twice about this.

226
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,670
這樣的人能把他嚇壞
This kind of psych profile scares the hell out of him.

227
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,500
他估計會覺得
As far as he's concerned,

228
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,510
你給他派了個一心想復仇的瘋子
you're sending him a Section 8 with an ax to grind.

229
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,370
在沙灘上發生的事
What happened to that kid on the beach,

230
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,740
改變了他的一生
it changed him.

231
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,580
就算通過訓練 你也不可能對任何人起那麼大的影響
You can't train that into someone.

232
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,440
他現在的心理狀況正是我夢寐以求的
His psych profile is exactly what I've been looking for.

233
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,050
做過測謊儀測試麼
Polygraph?

234
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,320
完美通過
Flying colors.

235
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,620
那就祝赫爾利好運吧
All right. Good luck with Hurley.

236
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,620
艾琳
Oh, Irene.

237
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,490
我們兩個小時內會收到
We'll have fresh intel on the Russian

238
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,330
關於俄羅斯濃縮鈾事件的情報
plutonium situation in two hours.

239
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,790
保持電話聯繫
Stay by your phone.

你可以把眼罩摘下來了
You can take the blindfold off.

251
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,690
關於這傢伙 有什麼我要知道的?
So, what do I need to know about this guy?

252
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,850
你是說斯坦·赫爾利麼
Stan Hurley.

253
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,950
他是個勇士
He's a warrior.

254
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,550
前海豹突擊隊特種兵
Ex-Navy SEAL.

255
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,690
我父親和他一起在波斯灣服役過
My daddy served with him in the Persian Gulf.

256
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,910
你負責這個項目麼
Did you go through this program?

257
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,910
我只是瞭解情況 不負責這個計劃
I went through a program. Not this one.

258
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,940
這個計劃不只是培養一個間諜
It's not like becoming a spy or Special Ops,

259
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,310
或者特工那麼簡單
none of those things.

260
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,950
知道了
Good.

261
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,320
米奇·拉普的心理報告

262
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,670
米奇 你的目標是什麼
So, what are your goals, Mitch?

263
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,440
我的目標?
My goals?

264
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,120
我的目標就是如果他們知道我要來了
My goal is to have them lie awake at night,

265
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,610
會嚇得睡不著覺
knowing I'm coming for them.

266
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,070
你不抽煙了?
I thought you were supposed to be on the patch.

267
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,170
你看了他的測試結果麼
You saw those tests.

268
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
看了
Yeah, I saw them.

269
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,680
十分優秀
He's off the charts.

270
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,780
優秀的人我也見過
I've seen off the charts before.

271
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,450
軍隊出身的人員可能會養成一些難以擺脫陋習
And he's got none of the bad habits

272
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
然而他就不必了
he'd have to unlearn if he had military training.

273
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,750
難以擺脫?
Unlearn?

274
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,620
斯坦
Come on, Stan.

275
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,500
讓你手下的那些海豹突擊隊進大城市裏試試
You drop one of your Navy SEALs in an urban setting,

276
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,760
周圍的人能輕鬆發現他們是當兵的
you can spot the boot camp on them a mile away.

277
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,790
現在不是..
We're not fighting the...

278
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,460
不是冷戰那時候了 我知道
Cold War? Yeah, I know.

279
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,330
副主任女士 你一直在提醒我這點
You keep telling me that, Miss Deputy Director.

280
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,700
我的天 你這麼尊敬我了
Oh, wow. "Miss Deputy Director."

281
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,530
你父親會支持我這麼做的
Your daddy would agree with me.

282
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,070
我每48小時聯繫你一次
I'll be checking in with you every 48 hours.

283
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,610
我早上坐飛機去倫敦
I'm on a plane to London in the morning.

284
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,680
趕緊去抽幾根吧
And go back on the patch, for God's sake.

285
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,810
別讓我失望
Don't prove me wrong.

286
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,120
她不會回來了
She ain't coming back.

287
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,460
嘿
Hey.

288
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,730
看著我
Eyes front and center.

289
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,960
抱歉
Sorry.

290
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
抱歉? 你以為我是你的大學教授麼
"Sorry"? Do I look like one of your college professors?

291
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,000
小子 你要稱呼我為"長官"
You talk to me, you call me "sir," son.

292
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,970
是 長官
Yes, sir.

293
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,940
你他媽的來這幹什麼呢
What the fuck you doing here?

294
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,850
是不是
Did you have some bad things happen to you,

295
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,850
有一些不幸的事發生在你身上
some shitty things happen to you?

296
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,820
你想把那些恐怖分子趕盡殺絕
Now you wanna kill those mean old terrorists.

297
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,950
就是那些你口中所謂的「壞人」
Go get some bad guys.

298
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,830
你憑什麼認為
What makes you think you can make it

299
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,060
你能通過我的選拔?
through my selection process?

300
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,760
我能說話麼 長官
Permission to speak, sir?

301
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,630
說吧 有話直說
Sure, go ahead if you got something to say.

302
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,560
因為你來這 就是個錯誤
Like this is all a big mistake and you wanna go home.

303
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,030
你想回家麼
You wanna go home? Good.

304
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,070
趕緊滾吧 要不然我幫你滾
Get the fuck out of here. I'll drive you myself.

305
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,960
不想 長官
Not at all, sir.

306
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,160
我覺得我們還是直入主題吧
I was gonna suggest we maybe speed this whole thing up?

307
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,080
我們倆過幾招
My guess is, if you and I go hand-to-hand,

308
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,880
我能否通過
you could probably figure out inside of 20 seconds

309
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,210
你的選拔
whether or not I have what it takes to make it

310
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,740
一看便知
through your selection process.

311
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,010
您覺得呢
So, what do you think?

312
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,250
給你一張床 一個儲物櫃
We got an empty cot, empty footlocker.

313
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,080
看你夠不夠格留在這裏了
They're both yours as long as you can last.

314
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,990
我覺得可以
Sounds good.

315
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,760
跟我來
Follow me.

316
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,020
待會見
See you out there.

317
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,300
順便說一句 我聽說了不少關於你的事
Heard a lot about you, by the way.

318
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,960
想看看你有多大的能耐
Excited to see what you got.

319
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,010
來殺我
Kill me.

320
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,180
總有人以為這樣就能要我的命
People think you can slice a man's throat like this.

321
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,590
只有拍電影才可能這麼容易
That's only in the movies.

322
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,050
就是這
Right there.

323
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,950
用力壓下去
Do it.

324
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,220
不會有動靜 不會搞成亂攤子
No noise. No mess.

325
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,570
維克多 你來
Victor, you're up.

326
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,610
我操
What the fuck, man?

327
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,580
誰他媽帶了把刀
Who grabs a fucking blade?

328
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,700
上啊
Come on, you fuckin' pussy. Let's go

329
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,770
應該注意到後面的情況
You gotta have eyes in the back of your head.

330
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,350
你猶豫一下 就死了
You flinch, you die.

331
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,120
獵戶座計劃的核心就是完成任務
Orion is about the mission.

332
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,290
能者就上
It ain't about you.

333
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,960
你要是戰死沙場 你就是個孤魂野鬼
You go down out there, you're a ghost, you don't exist.

334
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,300
沒有人會回來救你的
There's nobody, nobody coming back for you.

335
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,370
要是你被俘了
You're about to be captured.

336
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,380
那就告別這個世界吧
Bye-bye.

我們現在瞭解到
We now know 15 kilos of plutonium-239

345
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,090
俄羅斯那邊有15千克的鈽-239不翼而飛
went missing during the Russian breach.

346
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,160
足夠造一個核武器了
It's enough to build a full-scale nuclear weapon.

347
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,290
但可能需要傾全國之力才能完成核武器的建造
But that would likely require the resources of a nation-state.

348
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,160
作為伊朗參謀總長
As Iranian Chief of General Staff,

349
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,130
我們對此事同樣關切
I share your concern.

350
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,100
我們同你們一樣 都在關注事態發展
We have been monitoring the situation as you have.

351
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,130
我們也不知道是什麼情況
I'm afraid we too are in the dark.

352
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,170
對伊朗來說 建造核武器
For Iran, of course,

353
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,240
是不可能的
a nuclear weapon is off the table.

354
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,870
我們簽訂了條約的
We have a treaty.

355
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,240
有一些伊朗人對這個條約不太滿意
You have countrymen who are not too happy about that.

356
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,850
我們監控了你們的濃縮項目
We monitor your nuclear enrichment program pretty closely,

357
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,680
發現有人在俄羅斯黑市上購買了這些鈽-239
but black market plutonium-239 from Russia...

358
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,420
關於黑市的情況 高層無從得知
Would be difficult for inspectors to detect.

359
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,050
您是肯尼迪女士 對吧?
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

360
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,690
作為伊朗國防部長 我向您保證
I assure you as Minister of Defense

361
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,930
我們知道如果我們伊朗
that we in Iran recognize how much the spirit of comity

362
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,400
通過任何途徑購買鈽燃料
between our nations would be compromised

363
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,300
都會影響到我們的國家利益
if we were to acquire

364
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,470
有違國際精神
weapons-grade plutonium from any source.

365
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,070
的確如此
Yes, it would.

366
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,740
這話對伊朗境外的勢力同樣適用
Same goes for your clients outside Iran,

367
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,310
真主黨 哈馬斯
Hezbollah. Hamas.

368
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,110
胡塞武裝
The Houthis.

369
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,950
無論在誰的手中 核武器都是危險的
Nuclear weapons are a danger in any hands, Director.

370
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,920
這不就是你們入侵
Wasn't that your pretext for your invasion

371
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,490
我們鄰國的理由麼
of our neighbor to the west?

372
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,020
50萬伊拉克人喪生
One that cost 500,000 Iraqi lives

373
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,390
留下一片廢墟
and left a wake of destruction

374
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,320
整個地區至今動盪不安
from which our region has never recovered.

375
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,830
羅斯塔米將軍 我們是掌握了確鑿的情況才來這會面的
General Rostami, we came only to tell you what we know.

376
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,260
你們這算是威脅我們麼
Is that a threat?

377
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:59,170
當然不是 比赫茲部長
Of course not, Minister Behruz.

378
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,900
各位先生 感謝參加這次會面
Gentlemen, I very much appreciate you meeting with us.

379
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,370
客氣了
Not at all.

380
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,840
很遺憾 不能給你們提供更多情報
I only wish we could offer more insight.

381
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
謝謝您的支持
Thank you.

382
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,360
我不相信那個羅斯塔米將軍
I don't trust General Rostami.

383
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,130
我們要低調行事
We need to keep this quiet.

384
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,190
獵戶座計劃進行的怎麼樣了
How ready is Orion?

385
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,130
我去問問赫爾利
I'll check in with Hurley.

386
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,530
為什麼好幾個小時了都沒人來
Why is there no one on watch?

387
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,270
你們死定了
You're all dead.

388
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,510
是啊 是啊 知道了
Yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.

389
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,510
你死了
You're dead.

390
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,850
你想說什麼 快說啊
You wanna say something to me? Say it. Go on, say it.

391
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,190
給你們30秒收拾
You got 30 seconds

392
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,930
這些是你們的目標
These are your targets.

393
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,860
記住他們
Memorize them.

394
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,400
你們要能辨認出他們來
It's your responsibility to be able to identify them.

395
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,270
殺掉一個武裝人員 得一分
You shoot a combatant, you get a point.

396
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
沒擊中的話 會受到一次電擊
You miss, you get a shock.

397
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,270
非戰鬥人員 會受到更強的電擊
You shoot a noncombatant, you get a bigger shock.

398
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,810
如果武裝人員擊中了你
Combatant shoots you...

399
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,310
我就這麼說吧 你那時候會感覺到的
Let's just say you're gonna feel it.

400
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,340
準備好了嗎
Ready?

401
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,010
開始
Go.

402
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,490
赫爾利在幹什麼
What's Hurley doing?

403
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,490
他腦子出問題了
He's fucking with his head.

410
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,120
我們開始吧
Shall we?

411
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,090
好
Okay.

412
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,590
挺不錯的
That's clever.

413
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,160
鈽原料
Raw plutonium.

414
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,700
之前商量好的 是濃縮的
Highly enriched, as promised.

415
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,300
希望如此
Let's hope.

416
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,910
先生們 聽到儀器發出響聲真是太棒了
Wow, that's a beautiful sound, gentlemen.

417
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,040
那我就拿走了
May I?

418
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,620
嗯
Okay.

419
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,250
快轉賬
Wire the money.

420
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,680
馬上就轉
That, I can do.

421
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,620
我就拿手機
This is a cell phone.

422
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,000
把你的車開走 有一個重要官員要經過這裏
Gotta move all the vans. The Cardinal's visiting.

423
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,270
好的
Okay.

424
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,750
五分鐘內就走
Okay. Five minutes.

425
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,040
車裏的是什麼
What's going on in there?

426
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,090
紀念品
Souvenirs.

427
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,510
可能是緊急情況 請求增援
Possible code red, backup needed.

428
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,760
別緊張 沒什麼情況
There's nothing going on.

429
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,140
進來看看嘛
Come in.

430
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,530
目前看來
It now appears that all seven victims

431
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,180
7名死者
were shot with a single weapon,

432
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,150
死於同一把手槍下
believed to be a Glock 29.

433
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,650
車內發現了武器級鈽的蹤跡
Traces of weaponized plutonium

434
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,220
同時還發現了
were detected inside the van

435
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,790
三具俄羅斯人
where the bodies of three Russians

436
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,260
和兩具波蘭警察的屍體
and two Warsaw police officers were found.

437
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,290
俄羅斯政府已經確認
The Russian government has confirmed

438
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,130
核燃料的化學指紋表明
that the chemical footprint of the plutonium in question

439
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,130
這正是托博爾斯克
is a match to the plutonium that was stolen

440
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,400
廢棄核設施內
from the decommissioned

441
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,530
失竊的鈽燃料
processing facility in Tobolsk.

442
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,540
波蘭警方正在和國際刑警組織合作
Security footage is being analyzed by Polish police,

443
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,710
分析監控錄像
now working in conjunction with Interpol,

444
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,770
試圖確認槍手的身份
to identify the shooter and his connection

445
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,480
調查他與鈽燃料失竊案之間有何聯繫
to the missing plutonium.

446
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,540
槍手的身份尚不得知
The identity of the shooter remains unknown...

447
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,580
你好 打擾一下
Hi, excuse me.

448
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,080
有什麼我能幫你的
- How can I help you?  - Question.

449
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,410
目標 活動中

450
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,550
需要我幫你麼
May I help you?

451
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,720
不 謝謝
No, thanks. I'm okay.

452
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,640
嘿
- Ow  Ow  Ow   - Hey  Hey  Hey

453
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,150
拉普 媽的
Rapp  God damn it

454
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,260
你要控制住自己
You have to stay under control.

455
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,480
媽的
Dickhead

456
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,150
這傢伙不知道什麼時候住手
Asshole doesn't know when to quit.

457
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,150
你在逗我麼 我剛剛救了你
You're kidding me, right? I just saved your ass.

458
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,430
拉普 你要知道什麼時候該停手
You've gotta know when the mission's been accomplished, Rapp.

459
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,930
- 長官 這傢伙..  - 聽著
- Sir, he's a fucking...  - Which he did.

460
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,260
別以為你只有眼前這一個目標
Never assume your target is the only target.

461
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,270
敵人可能看起來沒什麼威脅 但實際上心狠手辣
The enemy dresses like a deer and he kills like a lion.

462
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,460
我們也要像他們一樣心狠手辣
And that's what we gotta do.

463
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,900
希望你能表現更出色
We just gotta do it better.

464
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,530
那就這樣吧
All right.

465
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,170
你這混蛋
You're an asshole.

466
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,750
出事了
We got a problem.

467
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,320
六周前 有人闖入
Six weeks ago, there was a breach

468
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,520
俄羅斯的一個廢棄鈽燃料設施
at a decommissioned Russian plutonium facility.

469
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,660
我聽說了
I'm aware.

470
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,290
但是你不知道 有15千克的鈽燃料失竊了
What you don't know is 15 kilos of plutonium went missing.

471
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,760
還是武器級的
Weapons-grade.

472
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,700
這麼多
That's a shit-ton of plutonium.

473
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,930
就這麼落入他人之手
And it just changed hands.

474
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,940
我想給你看點東西
I wanna show you something.

475
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,210
看看這個
Take a look at this.

476
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,640
你應該認識這張臉吧
Does that face bong a gong for you?

477
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,210
還是只有我一個覺得這人很熟悉
Or is it just me?

478
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,980
不可能是他
It can't be him.

479
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,520
在轟炸了巴馬科的大使館之後 我們派出無人機又確認了一次
Our drones took him out after the embassy bombing at Bamako.

480
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,420
我們無法完全確定屍體身份
We never got a positive ID.

481
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,460
那是我們這的叛逃特工
That's our mad dog out there.

482
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,730
那行 我們先假設是他
All right. Let's say it's him.

483
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,460
艾琳 不用假設 就是他
It's him, Irene.

484
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,830
現在有一個一石二鳥的機會
This gives us a chance to kill two birds with one stone.

485
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,340
哈姆迪·沙裏夫
Hamdi Sharif.

486
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,870
他是一個武器販子 目前在土耳其
He's an arms dealer working out of Turkey.

487
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,740
四周前他買了一個俄羅斯設計的核裝置起爆器
Four days ago, he purchased a Russian-designed nuclear trigger.

488
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,710
他肯定打算把這玩意轉手
And he's gonna be selling it.

489
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,340
沙裏夫手上有誘餌
Sharif's got the honey.

490
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,580
我們只需等待獵物上鉤
Now we just wait for the bee.

491
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,780
我們派人破壞他們的交易
We go in, we fuck up their deal.

492
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,950
把他們都幹掉
And we take 'em both out.

493
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,290
你去伊斯坦布爾
You're going to Istanbul.

494
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,490
我們那邊有特工接應
We have an agent in place.

495
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,670
她會在機場接你
She'll meet you at the airport.

496
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,430
明白
All right.

497
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,760
安妮卡·奧格登
Annika Ogden. We've had her on the ground over there

498
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,900
她在那潛伏5年了
for five years.

499
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,370
讓拉普參與這次行動
I want Rapp on the team.

500
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,640
你沒開玩笑吧
Really?

501
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,840
斯坦 他已經準備好了吧
He's ready, Stan.

502
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,270
艾琳 我覺得他目前還沒準備好
Actually, Irene, he's not ready.

503
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,610
但我會讓他準備好的
But he will be.

504
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,620
長官 找我有事麼
You wanted to see me, sir?

505
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,650
對 把門關上
Yeah. Shut the door.

506
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,290
我們有任務了
We're shipping out.

507
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,520
把東西放桌上
Set those down there.

508
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,930
你喜歡看電影麼
You like movies?

509
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,790
喜歡
Sure.

510
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,670
我想給你看點東西
I got something for you.

511
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,800
這他媽是什麼鬼
What the fuck is this?

512
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,530
我也覺得挺操蛋呢
Yeah, I thought so.

513
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,720
你說什麼
You thought so?

514
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,870
是啊
Yeah.

515
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,940
你為什麼大難不死呢 拉普
Why are you even alive, Rapp?

516
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,580
你有沒有問過自己這個問題
You ever asked yourself that?

517
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,810
為什麼是你 而不是這些人
Why you? You know, of all those people?

518
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,510
我覺得 肯定是因為你很特別
You're special, I guess.

519
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,710
我的天
Oh, my God

520
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,080
需要我調高音量麼
You want me to turn it up?

521
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,050
- 我願意嫁給你  - 拿著吧
- I'll marry you   - Take it

522
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,090
你這混蛋 把視頻關上
You're a fucking coward, you know that? Turn that shit off.

523
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,090
這是我媽媽的戒指 你覺得怎麼樣
What do you think? It's my mom's ring.

524
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,730
關掉
You gonna turn it off?

525
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,060
卡特麗娜
Katrina

526
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,770
我是不是應該為你感到遺憾
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

527
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,700
我覺得還是不吧
I don't.

528
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,580
你犯了大錯
You made a big mistake.

529
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,720
你讓情緒影響到了你的判斷力
You let emotion cloud your judgment.

530
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,090
永遠不要受制於自己的情緒
Never, ever let it get personal.

531
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,560
明白了麼
You understand?

532
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,370
我明白了
Yeah, I got it.

533
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,840
準備好 早上5點出發
Be ready to go by 5:00.

534
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,110
我們4點半見面
See you at 4:30.

535
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,380
伊斯坦布爾 土耳其
You know what you're gonna do here?

536
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,430
我知道我們來這幹什麼嗎
No, sir.

537
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,450
- 不知道 長官  - 嗯
Correct. You don't.

538
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,960
多觀察 少說話
So keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.

539
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,020
聽我命令
And wait for my orders.

540
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,050
哈姆迪·沙裏夫 房地產大亨 武器販子
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate mogul/arms dealer.

541
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,390
養活了不少恐怖分子
He's like Santa Claus for terrorists.

542
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,760
一個人渣
Scumbag.

543
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,660
小子 省省你那些
Spare me your junior-year-abroad

544
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,430
幼稚的看法吧
moral opinion, would you, Rapp?

545
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,760
長官 這不只是我的個人看法而已 他就是個人渣
Not really an opinion, sir. Sharif's a piece of shit.

546
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,160
我們這不是聖戰
It's not a crusade.

547
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
任務以實用為重 不要受制於...
This mission is practical. Don't make it...

548
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,530
個人情緒?
Personal?

549
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,720
沒錯
Exactly.

550
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,870
明白 長官
Yes, sir.

551
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,670
維克多 你跟我一起
Victor, you're with me.

552
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,770
拉普和安妮卡 你們注意觀察情況
Rapp, you and Annika are eyes on.

553
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,040
沙裏夫日常生活很規律
Sharif has a routine.

554
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,690
看看他最近有什麼異常
Let's see if anything breaks his pattern.

555
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,650
- 明白了麼  - 是 長官
- Got it?  - Yes, sir.

556
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
我們有48小時完成任務
All right, we got 48 hours.

557
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,050
要做的乾淨利索 不留痕跡
Quick, clean. No footprint.

558
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,980
這裏的各股勢力也是錯綜複雜的
This town's ready to blow as it is.

559
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,790
你要去哪
Where the hell are you going?

560
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,370
抱歉
Excuse me.

561
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,830
解密進行中

562
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,880
這他媽太冒進了
That was fucking reckless, Rapp.

563
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,580
長官 我這是主動出擊
I took the initiative, sir.

564
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,260
- 可能會搞砸的  - 但我完成了
- He could've been made.  - Well, I wasn't.

565
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,090
結果出來了
Here we go.

566
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,690
明天上午11點
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

567
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,860
同他的情婦見面之前
A meeting at a restaurant on Akbiyik Street.

568
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,760
他會去阿克比克街的餐館
That's right before Sharif goes to see his mistress.

569
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:34,230
這不符合他平時的日程
That breaks his pattern.

570
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,810
更關鍵的是
I'll tell you what'll break his pattern.

571
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,270
當他的助理告訴他手機丟了
When that fucking assistant tells his boss

572
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,700
那就糟糕了
he lost his goddamn phone.

573
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,970
他不會說的
He won't.

574
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,770
他太怕沙裏夫了 不敢告訴沙裏夫自己搞砸了
He's too afraid of Sharif to let him know he screwed up.

575
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,770
那行 我們明天行動
All right. We go tomorrow.

576
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,070
任務目標是?
What's the mission, sir?

577
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:48,880
幹掉買家 幹掉賣家
Eliminate the target. Eliminate the recipient.

578
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,040
帶走貨物
Obtain the package.

579
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,780
貨物是什麼
And what's the package?

580
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,970
到時候就知道了
We'll know it when we see it.

581
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,210
你打頭陣
You're lead.

582
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,520
你做後援
You're backup.

583
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,520
我們在街對面監視現場情況
We will watch from across the street.

584
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,430
我們倆扮演一對情侶
We get to play lovers.

585
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,670
你們倆相戀多久了
How long have you been married?

586
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,110
他以為我們已經結婚了
He thinks we're married.

587
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,020
別想太多
Don't think too much.

588
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,690
你會緊張過頭的
You'll lose your nerve.

589
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,930
我覺得不會
No, I don't think so.

590
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,330
這是你第一次參加任務麼
It'll be your first time.

591
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,000
在我的腦海中 我已經參加了很多次任務了
Yeah, not in my mind.

592
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,850
老大 目標來了
Lead, your friend's arriving now.

593
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:16,950
收到
Copy.

594
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,270
真他媽的是軍隊級別的保護啊
And he brought a shitload of military protection.

595
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,710
我來搞定他們
I'll take care of the MPs.

596
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,780
親愛的 別發火嘛
Oh, come on, now, honey. Don't be mad.

597
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,680
不不不
No, no, no.

598
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,150
我還有點事 真的
I had a few. Yeah, I did.

599
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,700
我回家後會給你補上的
I'll make it up to you when I get home.

600
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,020
你懂的
You know that.

601
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,810
貝勒貝伊宮附近發現汽車炸彈
Car bombing, near Beylerbeyi Palace.

602
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,340
把這條消息匯報上去 要不然我就割破你的喉嚨
Call it in. Call it in, or I'll cut your fucking throat.

603
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,060
開始行動
Lead, you're a go.

604
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,760
二號 進入指定位置

605
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,120

606
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,040
抱歉
Pardon.

607
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,140
起爆器在轎車裏
The nuclear trigger is in the sedan.

608
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,920
目標逃走了
Target's gone. Target's gone.

609
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,320
快走
Get back

610
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:17,950

615
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,500
媽的 亂成一團了 我們撤
God damn it, this is a fucking mess. We're out of here.

616
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,050
老實點
Drive  Drive

617
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,890
跟著你們的老大
Follow your boss

618
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,020
別殺我 我是他的助手
Please, I'm just the assistant

619
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,560
別殺我
Don't hurt me

620
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,360
快開車
Drive  Drive

621
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,770
他住這的五樓
He's there right now on the fifth floor.

622
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,400
他做的事我也不喜歡
Please I don't approve of what Sharif does.

623
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,870
別殺我
Don't kill me.

624

你違背了我的命令
You disobeyed a direct order.

646
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,590
不 我決定追蹤目標
No, I made a decision to pursue the target,

647
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,220
完成任務
and I completed the mission.

648
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,160
我來這就是為了完成任務
And, sir, isn't that what I'm here to do? Isn't that my job?

649
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:05,130
我他媽的要你幹什麼 你就幹什麼
Your fucking job is to do what I fucking tell you to do

650
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,570
那就是說 你更傾向於讓我離開那
What, you prefer I leave him alive, then,

651
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,200
放那人渣一馬咯
let him go? That piece of shit?

652
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,480
斯坦

在那等著
Wait here.

655
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,210
你看 這麼下去
Look at that. That's the kind of bullshit

656
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,510
這傢伙會搞砸的
that could shut us down.

657
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,620
這小子不會遵守命令
Kid can't even follow a fucking order.

658
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,930
維克托沒辦到的事 拉普辦到了
Victor got made. Rapp didn't.

659
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,260
他媽的 你為什麼這麼看好這個小子
Why does this kid give you such a fucking hard-on?

660
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,260
別他媽的跟我這麼說話 我是你的上級
Don't talk to me like that  I'm your superior.

661
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,360
我的上級? 艾琳
My superior, Irene?

662
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,800
正是你的上級 媽的
Your superior, God damn it.

663
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,400
你知不知道 我花了多久才找到
Do you have any idea how long I spent looking

664
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,300
這麼有才 這麼有膽識的小伙子
for someone with that kid's talent and balls?

665
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,410
讓拉普留下
Rapp stays.

666
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,910
這是命令麼
You're giving me an order?

667
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,170
沒錯
That's an affirmative.

668
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,340
讓我跟他單獨談會
Can you give us a minute?

669
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,550
看看這個
Look at this.

670
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,320
起爆器肯定在那輛車上
The trigger must have been in that car.

671
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,420
看看
Look at him.

672
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,760
就是他
Lookin' at me.

673
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,830
這傢伙幹出來的好事
Everything he did there,

674
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,330
都是我教出來的
I taught him how to do it.

675
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,960
斯坦
Stan.

676
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,470
我真不應該把他從海軍裏招過來
I should've left him in the Navy.

677
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,580
我要親手殺了他
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

678
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,740
斯坦 聽我說
Stan, listen to me.

679
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,270
重要的是
The only thing that matters now

680
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,750
這個瘋子已經拿到了
is that fucking lunatic has everything he needs

681
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:19,840
制取核武器的全部環節
to build a nuclear weapon.

682
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,710
他拿到了起爆器 現在要買通一個物理學家
He's got a trigger. Now he needs to buy a physicist.

683
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,250
你現在要搞清楚
We just have to figure out

684
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,850
他們要在哪造核武器
where they're gonna build this thing.

685
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,620
本
Ben.

拉普從沙裏夫家拿到的那台筆記本電腦
That computer our boy Rapp lifted from Sharif's house,

687
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,860
顯示 有一筆兩百萬美元的款項
there's evidence of a $2 million transfer to a bank account in Rome.

688
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,620
打到了一家羅馬銀行的賬戶上 等待支取
Cash prepped for withdrawal.

689
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,720
那我們去羅馬
Rome.

這是你的錢
Your money.

702
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,440
部長 我最近讀了一些東西
I've been reading up, Minister.

703
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:12,610
你們伊朗人可能從小時候起就知道了
You Iranians probably all learn this growing up,

704
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,740
簽訂禁核條約前心裏就有數了
or at least you did before you signed that treaty.

705
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,280
我沒想到還有這麼些有趣的情況
But me, I had no idea about these fun facts.

706
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,010
要是你的話我就不會進去
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

707
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,620
起爆點三英里半徑內的人都會蒸發掉
Inside three miles, apparently you just vaporize.

708
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,820
有一些倖免於難
Some folks don't.

709
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,820
他們的皮膚會被烤黑 燒焦
They get all black and charred,

710
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:37,330
扭曲成一團 沒人知道為什麼會成這個樣子
and dense as lead, and no one knows why.

711
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,760
五英里半徑內 熱浪席捲一切
Inside five miles, everything is sucked into a void,

712
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,000
溫度比太陽中心還高
hotter than the core of the sun.

713
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,540
你們覺得怎麼樣
How about that?

714
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,900
剩下的錢在哪
Where's the rest?

715
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,610
搞定了這個再給你們剩下的錢
You'll get the rest of your money when the job's done.

716
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,920
我派來的物理學家呢
Where is my physicist?

717
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,580
他拿到錢後 我們把他接過來
He'll pick up his money, then we'll pick him up.

718
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,610
他住在羅馬的一家酒店
He's staying at a hotel in Rome.

719
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,720
我們會在一天內完成武器的組裝
We'll need an extra day to configure the weapon, then it's all yours.

720
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,920
你們想殺掉多少猶太人就殺多少
Kill as many Jews as you want.

721
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,930
為我們的勝利祈禱吧 兄弟
Do you practice Salah, brother?

722
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,500
我收到款項 完成任務
I receive my payment, complete the project.

723
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,040
我就是幹這個的 兄弟
That's my practice, brother.

724
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,340

Very well.

伊斯坦布爾的
Who was that guy?

734
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,570
那傢伙是誰
In Istanbul.

735
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,610
他似乎總是先我們一步
It seemed like he was a step ahead of us.

736
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,680
嘿 你打不打算告訴我
Hey, you gonna fill me in here or what?

737
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,760
有些壞人作惡
There's some bad people planning on doing some bad things,

738
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,980
我們要阻止他們
and it's our job to stop them.

739
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,820
關於維克多 你好像沒說什麼
You still haven't said anything about Victor.

740
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:21,520
維克多消失了 維克多不存在了
Victor's gone. Victor doesn't exist.

741
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,600
拉普 你覺得我們在這裏是幹什麼的
What is it you think we do here, Rapp?

742
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,800
我們幹掉那些該死的傢伙
I think we kill people who need to be killed.

743
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,850
那誰來告訴你應該幹掉誰呢
And who do you trust to tell you?

744
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,200
遵守命令就行了
I follow orders.

745
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,040
你想執行命令的時候 才執行命令
No, you follow orders when they suit you.

746
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,570
你加入我們
This whole thing is pretty much

747
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,540
只是實現自己目標的一種手段
just a means to an end for you, isn't it?

748
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:44,980
長官 我經歷了很多事
A lot's happened in my life, sir.

749
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,010
是麼
Really? Huh.

750
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,010
是啊
Yeah.

751
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,510
所以你覺得 我們派你到這來
So you think you were sent here

752
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,820
是為了給你人生中的遺憾 憤怒
as an outlet for your self-pity,

753
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,950
愧疚 找個發洩口?
and your anger, and all your guilt. Right?

754
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,490
愛國主義之所以還存在
Patriotism exists

755
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,560
是因為有你我這樣的人為崇高的事業而奮鬥
because people like you and people like me need a higher cause.

756
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,890
為了比我們倆更重要的目標而奮鬥
Something bigger than us.

757
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,700
你腦子裏你認為是"復仇"的玩意
That stink coming outta you

758
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:08,630
就是狗屁
you like to call "revenge," the rest of us call "shit."

759
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,180
如果你沉浸於其中
And as soon as it starts to feel good,

760
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,000
你就不再是一位合格的特工
that's when you stop being a professional.

761
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:13,470
那時候的你一文不值
And then what are you?

762
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,710
來說點好消息吧
Tell us something good, darling.

763
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,610
我們入侵了他們的系統
We're in their system.

764
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:29,720
一有人把錢從沙裏夫的賬上取走
The moment that transfer from Sharif's account is picked up,

765
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,690
我們就能馬上收到消息
we'll know it.

766
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,620
你的笑容像紅海一樣美
Boy, you just smile, and the Red Sea parts.

767
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,990
地中海也很美啊
Works in the Med, too.

768
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,260
你太美艷了
I'll bet it does.

769
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,740
有人把沙裏夫賬戶裏的錢取出來了 兩百萬美元
Cash withdrawal from Sharif's account. $2 million, U.S.

770
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:15,890
掃瞄中

771
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,310
未找到匹配項

772
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,070

773
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,280
發現那個物理學家了 我們走
There's our physicist. Let's go.

774
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:30,290
歡迎來到博斯科洛大酒店 祝您入住愉快
Welcome to the Boscolo and enjoy your stay.

775
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,030
謝謝
- Thank you very much.  - Thank you.

776
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,740
他住1448間
He's in 1448.

777
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,570
我們住他隔壁
And we're next door.

Suite 1448. We're in 1449, right next door.

782
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:23,770
抓住那個物理學家 把他帶出來
All right. We'll grab the physicist,

783
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,970
我去接應你們
and we'll take out whosever coming for him.

784
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,640
每15分鐘給我打一次信號
Signal every 15 minutes.

785
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,280
嘿
Hey.

786
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,830
我聽說了你的遭遇
I know what happened to you.

787
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,360
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

788
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:34,040
我很能理解你
I understand you.

789
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,770
比你認為的更甚
More than you know.

790
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:52,020
我知道失去我們所愛的人是多麼的心痛
I know what it's like to lose people you love.

791
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,390
我們要把這些壞蛋繩之以法
We're gonna get these fuckers.

792
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,100
我靠
Fuck

793
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,740
你們他媽的在哪呢
Where the hell are you?

794
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,160
赫爾利
Hurley... Where is he?

795
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,030
在哪裏
I don't know what you're talking...

796
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,420
我不知道你在說什麼
Where is he?

797
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,320
他在哪
He outside?

798
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:53,260
在外面
Please, no.

799
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,100
饒命啊
Please.

800
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,470
赫爾利 什麼鬼
Hurley, what the fuck?

801
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,950
你不是在盯梢麼 怎麼沒發現他們
I thought you were eyes on, why didn't you spot 'em?

802
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:05,240
他們比我們早到賓館
They were already in the damn hotel.

803
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:06,870
當地的黑手黨在與他們合作
Local mafia's working with 'em.

804
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,280
我會聯繫肯尼迪副主任 已經抓到物理學家了
I'll tell Kennedy we have the physicist.

805
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,990
剛才那邊是什麼情況
What the hell just happened out there, huh?

806
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,060
那傢伙把我們的行動搞砸了兩次
That's twice now this guy's blown up our entire op.

807
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,460
目標是什麼
What's the target? Huh? What's the target?

808
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:31,130
- 我不知道 先生  - 說啊
- I don't know, mister.  - Yeah, you do.

809
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,900
你以為我看不出來麼
Do you think I'm stupid?

810
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,240
他是個美國人 他認識你
He's an American. He said your name.

811
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,630
是你訓練了他？
Did you train this guy?

812
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,390
你喜歡抽煙麼
You like to smoke?

813
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:41,100
我的天
Oh, Jesus Christ

814
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,970
你抽煙麼
- Are you a smoker?  - I don't...

815
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:44,400
這習慣可不太妙啊
- Wait   - Bad habit.

816
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,140
慢著 我說我說
Wait, stop  Wait, wait  I know something.

817
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,620
- 什麼  - 我說我說
- What do you know?  - I know something.

818
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,310
他們稱那個傢伙為「幽靈」
There is a man... There is a man they call Ghost.

819
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:56,250
「幽靈」 那個伊朗人就是這麼稱呼他的
Ghost. I think it was an Iranian man said it.

820
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,660
他們在哪造炸彈
- Uh-huh. Where are they building the bomb?  - I just...

821
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:59,130
- 他們在哪造炸彈  - 我只是拿了錢而已
- Where are they building it?  - Took the money.

822
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,920
他們在哪造炸彈
Where are they building it?

823
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,920
再給你點時間好好想想
All right, here. Take some time to think about it.

824
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,230
就是那個「幽靈」麼
Ghost. Is that his name?

825
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,930
為什麼他要追蹤你
Why is this guy after you?

826
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,530
是不是出於個人原因?
Something personal, sir?

827
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,300
他們在造核彈
They're building a nuke.

828
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,340
去納沃納賓館
Hotel Navona.

829
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:20,170
洗個澡吧
- Clean yourself up.  - Wait.

830
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,270
別走啊
Don't go.

831
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,410
美國總統命令美國海軍第六艦隊
America's president has ordered the Sixth Fleet

832
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,680
離開意大利那不勒斯的海軍基地
out of the U.S. Naval base in Naples, Italy.

833
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,310
朝西南方向航行
The Sixth Fleet is now southwest off the coast...

834
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,920
我來幫你
Let me help you.

835
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:34,150
沒事的 我自己來
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

836
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,420
還是我來吧
You're not.

837
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,400
你今天覺得如何
How are you holding up?

838
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,510
我今天很害怕
I was afraid today.

839
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,380
還以為我們都要丟命了
I thought we were going to die.

840
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,650
我要麼一直很害怕 要麼永遠不害怕
Yeah, I'm either always afraid or never afraid.

841
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,320
我不知道我究竟是什麼感受
I don't know which.

842
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,970
貼好了
There you go.

843
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,240
放鬆一會兒吧
Just relax now.

844
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,040
明天再去找「幽靈」
We'll search for Ghost tomorrow.

845
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,560
你嚇到我了
You scared me.

846
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:00,490
你是誰
Who are you?

847
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,100
你什麼意思
What do you mean?

848
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:04,100
你之前說「幽靈」
You said "Ghost."

849
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,320
那又怎麼了
What about him?

850
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,500
我從來沒提過這個名字
I never told you that name.

851
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:07,740
赫爾利告訴過我的
Hurley did.

852
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,670
你就扯淡吧
Yeah, I think you're full of shit.

853
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,370
你到底是誰
- Mitch.  - Who are you?

854
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:13,420
- 你有毛病吧  - 你為誰效勞
- Mitch, what's wrong with you?  - Who do you work for?

855
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,080
我是中情局的
I'm CIA.

856
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,080
別他媽的騙我
Now don't fucking lie to me

857
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:18,440
我沒撒謊
I'm not lying

858
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,780
你是伊朗人
You're Iranian, aren't you?

859
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,280
放開我
Get the fuck away from me

860
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,290
你跟那幫伊朗人是一夥的?
Are you working with the Iranians?

861
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,360
說實話
Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth

862
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:42,590
去死吧
Go to hell

863
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,610
你是伊朗情報部門的麼
You Iranian intelligence?

864
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,710
你是伊朗情報部門的麼
Are you Iranian intelligence?

865
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,290
關於幽靈 你知道多少
What do you know about Ghost?

866
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,070
我們需要解密裝置
We're gonna need the decryption device.

867
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:35,580
你說的對 米奇
You were right, Mitch.

868
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:38,220
很難讓這個伊朗間諜開口
This Iranian mole is a tough nut to crack.

869
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,650
我只從她那問到了她的接頭人 阿扎德·阿沙尼
All I could get from her was her handler. Azad Ashani.

870
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:41,800
他是我的一個朋友
Happens to be a friend of mine.

871
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,190
我要去見見他
I'm gonna go pay him a visit.

872
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,410
我跟你一起去
Okay, I'm going with you.

873
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:45,590
不行
No.

874
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,220
我要你待在這
I need you to stay here.

875
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,790
肯尼迪帶了一群中情局
Kennedy's on her way with the CIA team

876
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,230
和摩薩德特工過來
and a Mossad team.

877
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,500
她肯定會問我你去哪了
She's gonna ask me where you went.

878
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:53,160
我要怎麼說
What the hell am I supposed to say?

879
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,470
沒錯 自己動點腦子
That's right, she is. And you're gonna be smart,

880
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,510
別說出去
and you're gonna keep your mouth shut,

881
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,200
掩蓋我的行蹤
and you're gonna cover my ass.

882
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,290
我還留著它呢
I still have it.

883
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,660
很不錯啊
Very nice.

884
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:32,330
斯坦 見到你 我總是很高興
I am always happy to meet you, Stan...

885
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:37,270
但是你每次找我談的事 都讓我高興不起來
But never happy why.

886
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,840
下次我們見面的時候 可以去吃個比薩
Well, maybe next time we'll meet for pizza.

887
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,140
那個女孩子挺有骨氣的
Your girl's tough, by the way.

888
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,780
對她好點
Go easy on her.

889
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:47,110
她是我的侄女
She's my niece.

890
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,680
嗯
Yeah.

891
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:58,590
你有什麼消息要告訴我麼
What have you got for me?

892
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,860
這件事的幕後黑手是羅斯塔米將軍
The men behind all this are General Rostami,

893
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:05,460
伊朗參謀總長
our military chief of staff,

894
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:08,360
還有國防部長比赫茲
and our defense minister, Behruz.

895
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,570
兩個人都很有權勢
Both are very powerful,

896
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,740
都對禁核協議的簽署心懷不滿
and both are very angry about the nuclear treaty we made with you.

897
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:16,640
過去的兩年內他們
They have been trying to acquire

898
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,540
一直試圖搞到核材料
nuclear materials for the past two years.

899
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,280
他們找來了那個
And they are the ones

900
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:23,740
叫「幽靈」的僱傭兵
who hired the mercenary called Ghost.

901
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:29,720
羅斯塔米在德黑蘭 比赫茲在羅馬
Rostami is now in Tehran, but Behruz is here in Rome.

902
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:34,690
我讓手下通過他的手機定位到他的位置
Annika has been tracking his movements through his cell phone.

903
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,860
他們在哪造核彈?
And they're building it here?

904
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,590
要是我知道就好了
I wish I knew.

905
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:40,360
我們抓住他們的物理學家了
We have their physicist.

906
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,330
他們沒法做了
They can't build it without him.

907
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,430
但是
But...

908
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,530
那個僱傭兵
The mercenary asked Behruz

909
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,400
叫比赫茲找一個伊朗的科學家來
to use one of ours, an Iranian.

910
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:53,200
比赫茲同意了 他們匆忙行事
Behruz agreed. That was rash.

911
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,940
說明他們急於盡快完工
It means they are in a hurry.

912
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:59,740
他們的目標是以色列?
And the target's Israel?

913
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,910
我也想告訴你更多信息
I wish I had better information for you.

914
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,590
赫爾利在哪
Where the hell is Hurley?

915
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,450
告訴我現在是什麼情況
You gotta tell me what's going on here. Now.

916
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,460
那傢伙是赫爾利培養出來的麼
That guy he trained, who the hell is he?

917
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,340
現在你不需要知道這個
That's not something you need to know right now.

918
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,390
你們在掩蓋什麼
What are you covering up?

919
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:21,430
當你有了足夠等級的安全許可
When you've got a level-5 security clearance

920
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,910
有了20年的工作經驗 再來找我談這個問題吧
and 20 years' experience, talk to me.

921
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,830
要不然就閉嘴 乖乖幹活吧
Until then, shut up and do your job.

922
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,940
我要你們解密並掃瞄她的手機
I want her cell phone decrypted and scanned.

923
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,780
當地警方一小時前在港口發現一具屍體
Local PD pulled a body from the harbor an hour ago.

924
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,340
胸部中彈
Gunshot to the chest.

925
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,480
死者是 伊朗情報官員 阿扎德·阿沙尼
Iranian intelligence officer, Azad Ashani.

926
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,750
我的天
Christ

927
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,780
赫爾利就是去見他了
That's the guy Hurley went to meet.

928
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,550
這個混蛋
Stupid son of a bitch

929
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,330
我覺得我們要去找到赫爾利的下落
All right, so what do we do? We gotta go after him.

930
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:48,550
他們在造一個他們的核彈 拉普
There's a fucking nuke in play, Rapp.

931
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,860
找到核彈是我們的任務 唯一的任務
That's the mission, and the only mission.

932
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:53,630
不管你怎麼看
This is now a joint CIA-Mossad operation,

933
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:54,930
現在這是中情局和摩薩德的聯合行動
whether we like it or not.

934
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,470
給我撥通局長的電話
Can you get the Director on the phone?

935
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:58,560
你就打算把他棄之於不顧了?
So you're just gonna write him off then?

936
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,430
這就是你的計劃?
That's the plan?

937
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,630
斯坦·赫爾利幾乎算得上是我的親人了
Stan Hurley is the closest thing to family I've got.

938
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,810
要是他現在在場
And if he were standing here right now,

939
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,470
他只會問一個問題
his only question would be,

940
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,380
為什麼我們要浪費時間去討論他的問題
why are we wasting our breath talking about him?

941
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:10,010
沒你的事了
You're through here.

942
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,570
你準備回程 這是命令
You're going home, that's an order.

943
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,980
現在給我坐下 閉嘴
Now, sit down and shut up.

944
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:08,660
為什麼你要幫我
Why are you helping me?

945
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:10,630
阿沙尼已經死了
Your handler Ashani was killed.

946
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,490
赫爾利去見他了 突遭意外
Hurley was with him. Something happened.

947
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:13,530
我們要去追蹤他們
I'm going after him.

948
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:17,600
我需要你的幫助
I need your help.

949
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,740
我們得動身了
We gotta go.

950
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:48,660
斯坦
Stan.

951
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,730
我等這一刻已經很久了
I've looked forward to this.

952
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,660
當然了 羅尼
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

953
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,740
我要給你看點東西
I wanna show you something.

954
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:56,800
行啊
All right.

955
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:11,380
看看這是不是野蠻人的作為
Savages. Right, Stan?

956
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,790
但我不怪他們
But you know something? I don't blame them.

957
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:18,150
而怪你
I blame you.

958
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:19,720
如果你不違抗命令
Never would've happened

959
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,930
就不會這樣了
if you would have followed orders, Ronnie.

960
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,960
你陣亡了 你就成幽靈了
"You go down out there, you're a ghost."

961
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:24,490
你就消失了
"You're a John Doe."

962
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:26,960
要是你被俘了
"You get captured?"

963
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,130
你還記得我說的話 我真高興
Oh, you remember. That's very gratifying.

964
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
謝謝你
Thank you.

965
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,870
羅尼 你讓我很自豪
You made me proud today, Ron.

966
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,940
你應該來救我的
You should've come for me.

967
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,910
你將更多人置於險境
Ten men would've died.

968
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,470
因為你他媽的沒有遵守命令
You put 10 men's lives in danger,

969
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,510
你將更多人的生命置於危險之中
'cause you couldn't follow a fucking order.

970
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:43,810
- 去你媽的  - 去你媽的命令
- Fuck you.  - Fuck orders.

971
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,550
重要的是我的性命
- Fuck the mission   - Fuck you.

972
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,910
我當時是你的手下 我信任你
This was me. I was your boy, I believe that.

973
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,050
你讓我對你深信不疑
You made me believe that.

974
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,600
阿沙尼讓手下
Ashani had their people tracking Minister Behruz's

975
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,630
追蹤比赫茲的手機位置
secure cell phone.

976
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,860
我們找到了比赫茲 就找到了赫爾利
So, we find Behruz, we find Hurley.

977
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,970
米奇
Mitch

978
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,150
看看你啊
Oh, yeah, look at that.

979
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,850
你是從阿勒頗的那些人那裏學會這招的麼
Did you learn that in Aleppo?

980
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,190
不
No.

981
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,460
斯坦 你教過我的 要讓敵人出乎意料
You always told us what to expect, Stan.

982
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,600
現在告訴我你的手下在哪
Now, where's the rest of your team?

983
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,630
我的天 羅尼
Come on, Ronnie, really?

984
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:25,510
- 別再叫我羅尼了  - 你的手下在哪
Don't call me that. Where's the rest of your team?

985
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,700
你手下的那個新人 他一直在找我
Your new boy out there, he on my tail?

986
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:31,170
羅尼 這是你犯下的第一個錯誤
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie. There's your first mistake.

987
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:34,180
審訊的時候 不要直入主題
You never start with a real question.

988
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,510
要循序漸進
You start slow.

989
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,010
進入到受審人的頭腦當中
You get inside your subject's head.

990
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:41,950
斯坦 我再問你一次
Stan, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

991
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,820
你犯的第二個錯誤
There's your second mistake. Number two.

992
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,290
第二個錯誤 就是 不要說「再問你一次」這種話
You don't say, "one more time." You already...

993
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,520
媽的
Damn

994
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:55,760
斯坦 我犯的第三個錯誤是什麼
Now, what's that third mistake, Stan?

995
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,730
是什麼
Huh? What is it?

996
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,670
來啊 繼續啊
Go ahead  Go ahead

997
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,170
我還有9個指甲呢 真爽
I got nine more  I like this.

998
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,600
真爽啊 再來啊
I like it. Go ahead, bring it on

999
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,710
你個混蛋
You motherfucker

1000
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:11,040
他想知道我們外面是不是有人
Ronnie wants to know if I got a team outside.

1001
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,210
對吧
Right, Ron?

1002
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,810
能不能安全的將核彈運走
If it's safe to move your bomb.

1003
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,750
是不是有人在跟蹤我們
Are we being followed?

1004
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,980
我的這個接班人在哪
Where's the new me?

1005
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,590
我做了調查 我瞭解他的一切情況
I've done my research. I know all about him.

1006
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,090
你是說米奇麼
"The new me..." Oh, you mean Mitch?

1007
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,790
我跟你說 米奇是個難以預測的傢伙
You know, Mitch, he's unpredictable.

1008
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,060
你算不準他的
You never know about Mitch.

1009
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,660
他行蹤不定
He might be here, he might be there.

1010
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,270
跟你很像 但你更加瘋狂
He's like you, but you're a real Section 8.

1011
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,330
夠了
Enough.

1012
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,530
操你媽
Schizo mom.

1013
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,700
他們在哪
Where are they?

1014
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,200
- 你個沒爹養的  - 他們在哪
- Loser dad.  - Where are they?

1015
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:41,700
我的天
God

1016
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,610
你的手下在哪
Where's the rest of your team?

1017
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,080
去你媽的
Half-wit mom, psycho dad...

1018
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:49,310
你手下的其他人在哪
Where's the rest of your team?

1019
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,840
- 你這人渣  - 你手下的其他人在哪
- You're pond scum.  - Where are they?

1020
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,080
你這混蛋
Pond scum  You're fucking...

1021
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:05,120
關於你接頭人的事 我很難過
I'm sorry about your handler.

1022
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:07,730
阿沙尼是我的叔叔
Ashani was my uncle.

1023
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,700
肯定是比赫茲和羅斯塔米派人刺殺了他
I'm sure it was Minister Behruz

1024
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:14,600
他們相對以色列發動核戰爭
and General Rostami who had him killed.

1025
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,300
我們試圖組織他們
They want nuclear war with Israel.

1026
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:19,170
在和他們的鬥爭中
We tried to stop them.

1027
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,070
我的兄弟和父親雙雙喪命
My brother and father both died fighting them.

1028
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,910
在這轉彎
Corviale. Turn here.

1029
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,750
你知道我最大的錯誤
You know what my real mistake was?

1030
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:37,050
就是信任你
I trusted you.

1031
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:40,090
你讓我覺得我能幹出一番大事
You made me feel like I was the Second Coming.

1032
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,890
你就像我的父親一樣
And you acted like my father.

1033
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,330
我信賴你 信賴美利堅合眾國海軍
I trusted you and I trusted the United States Navy.

1034
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:02,310
美國做的事 都是正確的 是麼 斯坦
U.S. of A. Does it, it's gotta be good. Right, Stan?

1035
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,380
只是 從來都沒人告訴我
Except

1036
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,780
你所負責的究竟是一個怎樣的項目
nobody told me the business y'all are really in.

1037
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:12,920
你們製造出怪物
You create monsters.

1038
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,250
這就是惡果
That's just what you do.

1039
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:18,020
這麼虐待我的人
Those people who did this to me,

1040
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,220
你覺得他們是野蠻人麼
you think they're barbarians?

1041
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:22,130
扯淡
Bullshit.

1042
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:32,040
我之前說的破解做的怎麼樣了
Where's the decryption I asked for?

1043
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:34,770
我們開工前拉普把手機拿走了
Rapp grabbed her smartphone before we could get any of it.

1044
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,940
目前找不到他
And we can't find him.

1045
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,780
監控攝像頭顯示
Surveillance cameras picked up Rapp

1046
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,840
他5分鐘前打暈了我們的一個特工
taking out our agents five minutes ago.

1047
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,950
你這是在幹什麼呢
What the hell are you doing?

1048
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:56,120
這裏發生的一切
There's not a single thing happening here

1049
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,360
都是你一手造成的
that you didn't make happen.

1050
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,930
上帝保佑這操蛋的美國 對吧
God bless fucking America, huh, Stan?

1051
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,870
我不能告訴你米奇在哪
I can tell you where Mitch is...

1052
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,440
斯坦 我犯的第三個錯誤是什麼
What's that third mistake, Stan?

1053
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,810
- 米奇..  - 我聽不見你說的話
Mitch... I can't hear you.

1054
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:18,910
我操
Fuck

1055
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:28,090
你犯的第三個錯誤 永遠不要和敵人站的太近
Third mistake, never get too close.

1056
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,050
趕快搞定你的私事
Finish your personal business here.

1057
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,760
你的任務已經結束了
Your work is done.

1058
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:33,190
炸彈已經裝備好了
The bomb is armed.

1059
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:34,490
- 啟動計時器了麼  - 是的
- Timer is set up?  - Yes.

1060
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,930
他在耍你
He's playing you.

1061
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,160
炸彈是給他造的 不是給你的
Bomb's not for you, it's for him.

1062
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,760
這只是他的計劃罷了
It was his plan all along

1063
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,190
連不上網絡
Dead zone.

1064
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,490
這裏收不到任何信號
We're not getting any signals here.

1065
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,870
等一下
Wait a second.

1066
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:55,030
你想拿核彈幹什麼
What are you gonna do with it?

1067
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:56,430
斯坦 不是我要幹什麼
No, Stan.

1068
01:23:57,930 --> 01:23:59,200
應該是我們要幹什麼
"What are we gonna do with it?"

1069
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,470
羅尼 為什麼選擇羅馬這個地方啊
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

1070
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,110
我喜歡羅馬
I like Rome.

1071
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:08,240
這裏食物很好吃
It's good food.

1072
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:16,380
永遠不要以為 我會戰死沙場
Never, ever thought I'd die in the field.

1073
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,820
是不是覺得我很瘋狂
Ain't it crazy?

1074
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:22,860
我覺得我以後想
I always figured it would be, I don't know,

1075
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:27,230
住在一個森林小屋裏 帶著我的狗
some cabin in the woods with my dog.

1076
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:28,960
我的話嘛
Me?

1077
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:31,230
我選擇過水上生活
I think I want water.

1078
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:34,370
死在海裏大概是十分平和的
There's just something peaceful about dying at sea.

1079
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,370
來吧
All right.

1080
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:44,210
結束這一切吧
Let's get it over with.

1081
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,340
不 你想痛痛快快的死
No, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1082
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,440
我不會殺了你的
I ain't gonna kill you.

1083
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,850
斯坦 我要讓你親眼見證
You're gonna live to see

1084
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,850
你一手造成的災難
the crown of your creation, Stan.

1085
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:56,020
數千美國人將會燒死
Thousands of Americans are gonna burn.

1086
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,850
就因為你
All because of you.

1087
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,990
好好觀賞吧
Enjoy the show.

1088
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,090
做好準備
Get ready.

1089
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,300
啟動倒計時
Go.

1090
01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:59,500
求求你救救我
Please help me.

1091
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,300
安妮卡
Annika.

1092
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,800
你的父母是好人
Your family were very well respected.

1093
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,550
我是他們的朋友
They were my friends.

1094
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:14,520
混蛋
Bastard.

1095
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,810
我跟他們很熟
I knew them very well.

1096
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,660
求求你
Please I beg you.

1097

1098
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,080

1103
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,490
拉普 你不應該來這的
You're not supposed to be here, Rapp.

1104
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,460
你想怎樣 把我開除?
Yeah, what are you gonna do, fire me?

1105
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:23,090
那邊還有一條通道 他搞到核彈了
There's another passage down there. He's got the nuke.

1106
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,190
- 你一個人可以吧  - 快去吧
You gonna be good?

1107
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:25,260
海軍 救援直升機
Go. Go

1108
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,630
把槍放下
Put the gun down.

1109
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:08,400
要不然她就死了
Or she's dead.

1110
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:12,470
米奇 我要去見我的親人
I want to see my family, Mitch.

1111
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:16,370
不 安妮卡
No, Annika, you don't.

1112
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:17,810
我要去見我的親人
I want to see my family.

1113
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,910
米奇 聽話

1114

安妮卡
Annika

1118
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:28,590
核彈會爆炸的
The bomb can't be stopped.

1119
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:30,290
你什麼也做不了 就像那個在沙灘上死掉的女人一樣
Just like you couldn't stop

1120
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:32,630
你救不了她
that beautiful girl from dying on the beach.

1121
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:38,530
艾琳
Irene.

1122
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,570
核彈在那艘船上
The bomb's on a boat.

1123
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,900
赫爾利
Hurley?

1124
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,500
你怎麼知道的
How do you know?

1125
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,740
羅尼向在海上引爆核彈
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

1126
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,950
是不是第六艦隊在附近巡邏
Is the Sixth Fleet out on maneuvers?

1127
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,650
我的天
Oh, my God.

1128
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,980
第勒尼安海 意大利

1129
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,980
把偵察衛星都調過來
Bring up ISR feeds.

1130
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,560
派飛機去現場偵查情況
Get me eyes in the sky over the coastline

1131
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:02,520
通知第六艦隊 發出核爆警告
and put the Sixth Fleet on nuclear alert.

1132
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,590
湯姆
Tom.

1133
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:07,290
目標是第六艦隊 他們目前離海岸線25英里
The target is the Sixth Fleet and it's 25 miles offshore.

1134
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,070
真是太恥辱了
It's a shame.

1135
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:20,610
你女朋友生前最後看到的一幕是 你沒法救她
The last thing your girl saw was you not saving her.

1136
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,620
戰鬥警報
General quarters.

1137
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,550
全體人員回到各自崗位
All hands, man your stations.

1138
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:38,550
這不是演習 重複一遍 這不是演習
This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill.

1139
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:41,420
有一艘攜帶了核裝置的小艇 正在接近中
Inbound, small vessel-borne nuclear device.

1140
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:50,430
小子 赫爾利是沒好好教過你麼
Didn't Hurley teach you anything, little brother?

1141
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,710
永遠不要受制於自己的情緒
To never make it personal.

1142
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,120
我可沒有受制於自己的情緒
This isn't personal.

1143
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,090
糟了
Shit.

1144
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:24,960
核彈上裝了計時器和起爆裝置
The bomb has a timer and a release trigger.

1145
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,600
炸毀小船會直接引爆核彈
We take out his boat, it'll detonate.

1146
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:29,600
如果核彈在水面爆炸
If it goes off above the waterline...

1147
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,500
那會是一場災難 放射性物質會飄到大陸上空
Disaster. There'll be fallout all over the mainland.

1148
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:38,910
這裏是美國海軍弗林艦 準備攻擊
USS Flynn... Prepare to engage.

1149
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,150
小艇轉彎了
The boat is turning, sir.

1150
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:52,850
誰在開船
Who's driving that boat?

1151
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,390
那是拉普
Rapp.

1152
01:35:00,530 --> 01:35:01,630
去接他
Go.

1153
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,560
- 長官您說什麼  - 去接他
- Sir?  - Go

1154
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,770
你在幹什麼呢
What are you doing? Hurley.

1155
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:15,910
赫爾利
Hurley?

1156
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,450
我想把他救上來
Trying to get our boy to throw the bomb in the water.

1157
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,040
弗林艦 準備好了就可以開火
Flynn, you are clear to fire when ready.

1158
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:23,010
別開火 小艇已經掉頭了
Do not fire, Commander. The boat is turning.

1159
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:26,020
不攻擊的話 核彈遲早會爆炸
If we don't engage, that guarantees detonation.

1160
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:27,180
我知道這風險很大
I understand there's a risk,

1161
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:28,750
但這是我們最好的機會了
but this is the best chance we've got.

1162
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:30,790
媽的
Shit  God damn it

1163
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:40,660
他在那呢
There he is.

1164
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,760
調至海軍無線電頻段
Get me on that boat's marine bandwidth.

1165
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,640
拉普
Rapp

1166
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,910
拉普
Rapp

1167
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,540
聽到我了麼 用無線電接聽
Can you hear me? Pick up the radio

1168
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:55,480
把炸彈從船上扔下去
Throw the bomb overboard

1169
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:57,680
不行 我要帶它離艦隊遠點
No way, sir, I gotta get further away from the fleet

1170
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:59,080
拉普
Rapp

1171
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:01,880
你他媽的這輩子 就服從我的命令行不行
For once in your life, take a goddamn order

1172
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,780
第六艦隊要朝你開火了
The Sixth Fleet is about to blow you to hell

1173
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:18,600
指揮部 這裏是德爾塔二隊 炸彈落入水中
Command, Delta Two, the bomb's in the water.

1174
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,800
- 指揮官 別開火  - 核彈落入水中
Commander, hold your fire  The bomb's in the water.

1175

01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,260
我們有30秒撤離
Got less than 30 seconds.

1179
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:02,300
快 我們撤
All right, go  Get outta here

1180
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:23,860

01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:06,060
注意 準備撞擊
Brace for impact.

1182
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:07,560
是 長官
Sir, yes, sir

1183
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:14,300

01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:56,070
抓穩了
Hold on

1185
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:10,280
坐穩了
Brace

1186
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:53,190
你就不該來救我的
You shouldn't have come for me.

1187
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,230
你要習慣我們經常這麼干 小子
Don't get used to it, son.

1188
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:01,960
赫爾利
Hurley...

1189
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,300
似乎我們能安全撤出去了
Looks like we're gonna be all right up here.

1190
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:06,130
我是這麼覺得的
I think.

1191

請匯報受損程度

1192

壓力值正常
Pressure is normalizing.

1193
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:17,310
船體多處受損
We have multiple hull breaches.

1194
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,150
艾森豪威爾號 輻射值如何
Radiologicals, Eisenhower?

1195
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,010
輻射值低

The casualty reports aren't in yet,

1200
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:33,430
估計我們都完蛋了

1201
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,030

1211
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,000
你幹嘛這麼盯著我看
You look like a mummy.

木乃伊可不用寫這些報告
A mummy doesn't have to write up reports.

1215
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:41,110
你口述吧 你挺擅長做報告的
Dictate them. You should be good at that.

1216
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:44,910
羅斯塔米將軍
Iranian official, General Rostami,

1217

1219
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:49,490
直播 爆炸性新聞 襲擊特拉維夫(以色列首都)的計劃是中情局散佈的謠言
羅斯塔米將軍宣佈競選總統

1220
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:51,550
有一個秘密暗殺組織

1221
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:54,320
應該對上周的核爆炸事件負責

He didn't even have to blow up Israel to get there.

1229
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:10,300
對我們來說 他還真是個大麻煩
He's gonna be a major pain in the ass, too.

1230

拉普在哪 我聯繫不上他
Where's Rapp? I can't reach him.

我怎麼會知道
How the hell do I know where Rapp is?

1232

我只不過是個醫院裏的木乃伊罷了
I'm a mummy in a hospital.

1233
