1
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:50,457
Here we are in beautiful Ibiza,
Spain.

2
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:52,078
Beautiful sand.

3
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,456
Beautiful waves.

4
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,961
My favorite shorts.

5
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:02,010
And my favorite girl
who is about to get...

6
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,131
Oh, my God!

7
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:04,963
Hey!

8
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:06,719
- Come on, give it to me.
- No! Stop! Come on!

9
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:08,094
- Mitch!
- This is great!

10
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:09,471
I'm serious.

11
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:11,974
Oh. Oh, my God.
That is so cute.

12
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:14,851
Honey, this is like...

13
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,308
Let me film for just a couple minutes.

14
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:18,518
- It's like we're honeymooners.
- Oh, my God!

15
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,274
# Honeymooners #

16
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:22,356
- "Honeymoon"?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,940
We're not married.

18
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,491
Katrina Harper...

19
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,253
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

20
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:41,295
Oh, my God. Babe, stop it.
You're gonna make me...

21
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:43,217
If you get emotional,
you're gonna kill me.

22
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,386
I'm trying to get through this, babe.

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,590
I love you, more than anything.

24
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,809
Will you marry me?

25
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:55,187
Oh, my God!

26
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:56,856
- Yes!
- Yeah?

27
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,308
Yes, Mitch Rapp.

28
00:01:58,402 --> 00:01:59,688
I'll marry you.

29
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,820
Sorry,
it's hard one-handed.

30
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:07,950
You like it?
It was my mom's ring.

31
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,704
I love it.

32
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:14,081
I love you.

33
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:24,216
- I'm still...
- Are you filming? Oh, my God!

34
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:25,760
Yeah, I'm still recording.
I'm trying to get this.

35
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,633
Come on, Mitch!

36
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:30,306
This is why I was filming now.
You see, now you get it.

37
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:31,428
Smile.

38
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,350
I'm gonna get drinks.

39
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,431
- Okay.
- Yeah?

40
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,515
Don't be too long.

41
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,817
I won't, I won't.

42
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:41,938
I love you.

43
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,019
I love you.

44
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,070
I'll be back.

45
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,365
Engagement drinks in the water,
people.

46
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,496
Whoo-hoo!

47
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:56,791
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,994
Very sweet, thanks.
Babe, we're getting applause.

49
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:02,789
I love you.

50
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,124
Thank you.

51
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:18,392
Hola. Como estas?

52
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,643
What can I get you?

53
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,975
Um, can I just get two drinks, please?

54
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,106
Dos bebidas, if that's right...

55
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:25,732
Um, I just got engaged,
so something special.

56
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:26,903
It can be anything, though.

57
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,231
Oh, you lucky guy.

58
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:33,573
Oh, can they be kinda strong too?
Is that cool?

59
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,451
Thank you, man.

60
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,337
Oh, whoa. Maybe not that strong.

61
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,608
Katrina!

62
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,124
Katrina!

63
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,092
Katrina?

64
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:41,770
Katrina!

65
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:47,939
Mitch!

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,816
Mitch!

67
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:53,737
Mitch!

68
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,863
Mitch!

69
00:04:58,373 --> 00:04:59,534
Katrina!

70
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,822
We're gonna fucking
set your shit on fire, man!

71
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:59,821
Fuckin' burn, motherfucker, burn!

72
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:01,402
To our brothers across the globe...

73
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:05,080
Come join our fight against
American imperialism.

74
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,749
They will pay for the
murder of our families,

75
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:11,204
our friends, and all children.

76
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:19,345
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

77
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,656
All right, stop! Come on, man!

78
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

79
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,365
Let him go, let him go.
Let him go, let him go!

80
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,950
Break it up. Let him go!

81
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,165
What the fuck is your deal, man?

82
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:35,712
That's it.
You're done, Rapp. Get out.

83
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,461
He keeps doing this shit.

84
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,540
Get out!

85
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,796
Have a nice fucking day.

86
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,222
You were out of line.

87
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,174
Back to work. Keep moving.

88
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,692
Get outta there!

89
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,768
You're gonna get yourself killed,
you dumb-ass!

90
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:40,853
What's up with this guy?

91
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,618
Fuck!

92
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:20,017
Rapp, why I gotta tell you again?

93
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,148
Sorry, Mr. Nazir.
I didn't realize it was past 10:00.

94
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:23,399
I'll try to keep it down.

95
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,822
Yeah, enough with the sports.

96
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,070
Copy that. All right. Thanks, Mr. Nazir.

97
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,760
He's up again.

98
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,504
Assalam-alaikum.

99
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,880
Walaikum-assalam.

100
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:40,244
Why have you come?

101
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,995
To help Adnan al-Mansur
achieve his people's destiny.

102
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,912
Inshallah.

103
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,963
I wanted to look in your eyes.

104
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:58,341
I don't trust you.

105
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,013
I'm prepared to die a martyr.

106
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,970
What can I do to earn your trust?

107
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:44,841
No!

108
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,975
Step away, now!

109
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,113
Come on!

110
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,406
The fuck off me!

111
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,610
He's dead, it's over.

112
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,946
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.

113
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,416
Area's secure.

114
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:15,085
You wanted to kill them all,
and then go on killing.

115
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,291
Pretty extreme, don't you think?

116
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:19,877
No, I don't think that's extreme at all.

117
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,553
I think people like that deserve to die

118
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,551
in the worst ways you can imagine.

119
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,849
What do you remember
about your parents' death?

120
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,927
Car crash.

121
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,227
I was in Massachusetts.

122
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,895
They were in Tunisia at the time.

123
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,314
I was 14.

124
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,687
That's what I remember.

125
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:37,110
You started having discipline problems.

126
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,233
Got yourself kicked out of
three boarding schools.

127
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:44,159
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I wonder what that was about.

128
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:47,488
Let's talk about what happened
after that day on the beach.

129
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:50,450
Oh, Jesus Christ. Again? Are you kidding me?

130
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,535
Yeah, again.

131
00:16:54,338 --> 00:16:57,627
You gave up everything
after that, didn't you?

132
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,835
Your grad studies at Brown University.

133
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:03,636
- I must have lost interest.
- In everything?

134
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:07,390
No, not everything.

135
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:20,232
See you later, Dr. Frain.

136
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,610
See you tomorrow, same time?

137
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:29,655
I like the new look.

138
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,002
Irene Kennedy, CIA Deputy Director

139
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,373
in charge of Counter-terrorism.

140
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:38,956
I know who you are.

141
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,712
Any idea how long you been here?

142
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,132
30 days.

143
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:47,806
Enough time for you to figure out
a couple things.

144
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:51,260
Yeah, yeah. I've figured out
a lot about myself.

145
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:53,346
It's been a very reflective time. Thank you.

146
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,398
You wouldn't have made it through
the next 20 seconds there alive.

147
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,522
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

148
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,730
You told Dr. Frain you thought
you were gonna kill Mansur

149
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:04,655
and wipe out his whole cell.

150
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:05,949
For starters.

151
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,697
Mmm-hmm.

152
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,528
You had an even bigger agenda,
didn't you, Mitch?

153
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:14,913
What did you think, you were gonna jump
from cell to cell taking out terrorists?

154
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:16,243
Righting the world's wrongs?

155
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:18,078
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

156
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:20,380
I mean, it's more than you accomplished.

157
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,549
I'm gonna let you in on something.

158
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,378
Our people here, they don't know
what to do with you.

159
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,963
A lot of them think we should
just throw you in a supermax.

160
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,758
Me?

161
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:32,808
I like your agenda, Mitch.

162
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:35,308
I can help you with it,
if you throw in with us.

163
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,557
We can teach you how to play
with the big boys.

164
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,392
Yeah, let me stop you right there.

165
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,194
You don't think I considered
that 18 months ago?

166
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:45,773
Joining the CIA?

167
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,529
I made the decision to
pursue Mansur on my own

168
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:50,656
'cause I knew I could get it done.

169
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:54,865
What you need to understand
is that I'm the only way.

170
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:57,367
To get what you want.

171
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,327
Why the hell would I trust you?

172
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:01,754
Because I believe in you.

173
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,463
And I'm all you've got.

174
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,591
What's been confirmed is

175
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,264
the enriched plutonium has been stolen

176
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,184
from a decommissioned
Russian nuclear facility.

177
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,262
If they get their hands on a nuclear trigger

178
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,766
and a physicist to build it,

179
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,474
they'd be able to arm it
and detonate it at any time.

180
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,101
Tom?

181
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:34,158
He's testing through the roof.

182
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,285
Might be the best I've ever seen.

183
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,458
We've had him under surveillance
for six months.

184
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,830
Martial arts, gun skills.

185
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,128
I've surveilled dozens of these vigilantes.

186
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,376
This one is different.

187
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,299
Yeah, well, I've gone over these, Irene.

188
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,468
He's non-compliant, he's oppositional.

189
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,466
He got us into Mansur's cell.

190
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,468
That's a hell of a lot more
than we ever managed.

191
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,799
All right, Orion is an elite unit, Irene.

192
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,259
A secret unit.

193
00:19:55,353 --> 00:19:57,811
Reports to you, me, and no one else.

194
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,013
I don't want to be responsible

195
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:00,187
for that kind of mistake.

196
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:02,015
Now, that's Hurley talking.

197
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,816
Yeah, well, he's called me twice about this.

198
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,862
This kind of psych profile
scares the hell out of him.

199
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:08,654
As far as he's concerned,

200
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,653
you're sending him a Section 8
with an ax to grind.

201
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,484
What happened to that kid on the beach,

202
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,944
it changed him.

203
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,529
You can't train that into someone.

204
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:18,491
His psych profile is exactly
what I've been looking for.

205
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,335
Polygraph?

206
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,502
Flying colors.

207
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,838
All right. Good luck with Hurley.

208
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,795
Oh, Irene.

209
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:33,630
We'll have fresh intel on the Russian

210
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,431
plutonium situation in two hours.

211
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,009
Stay by your phone.

212
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,093
Yeah.

213
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,405
You can take the blindfold off.

214
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,867
So, what do I need to know about this guy?

215
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,042
Stan Hurley.

216
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,212
He's a warrior.

217
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,708
Ex-Navy SEAL.

218
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,882
My daddy served with
him in the Persian Gulf.

219
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:30,153
Did you go through this program?

220
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,151
I went through a program. Not this one.

221
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:34,198
It's not like becoming a spy or Special Ops,

222
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:35,401
none of those things.

223
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:38,194
Good.

224
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,890
So, what are your goals, Mitch?

225
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:02,560
My goals?

226
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:04,387
My goal is to have them lie awake at night,

227
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:05,848
knowing I'm coming for them.

228
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,346
I thought you were supposed
to be on the patch.

229
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,476
You saw those tests. Yeah, I saw them.

230
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,848
He's off the charts.

231
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:47,973
I've seen off the charts before.

232
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,558
And he's got none of the bad habits

233
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,609
he'd have to unlearn
if he had military training.

234
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,945
Unlearn?

235
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,818
Come on, Stan.

236
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,615
You drop one of your Navy SEALs
in an urban setting,

237
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,943
you can spot the boot camp
on them a mile away.

238
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:01,027
We're not fighting the...

239
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:02,578
Cold War? Yeah, I know.

240
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:04,201
You keep telling me that,
Miss Deputy Director.

241
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,868
Oh, wow. "Miss Deputy Director."

242
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:09,954
Your daddy would agree with me.

243
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,339
I'll be checking in with you every 48 hours.

244
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:18,427
I'm on a plane to London in the morning.

245
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,885
And go back on the patch, for God's sake.

246
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:25,768
Don't prove me wrong.

247
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:35,403
She ain't coming back.

248
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:40,571
Hey.

249
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,952
Eyes front and center.

250
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:45,197
Sorry.

251
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,328
"Sorry"? Do I look like one of
your college professors?

252
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:49,284
You talk to me, you call me "sir," son.

253
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:51,203
Yes, sir.

254
00:23:58,262 --> 00:24:00,174
What the fuck you doing here?

255
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:02,051
Did you have some bad things happen to you,

256
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,053
some shitty things happen to you?

257
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:07,011
Now you wanna kill those
mean old terrorists.

258
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:08,220
Go get some bad guys.

259
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,269
What makes you think you can make it
through my selection process?

260
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,941
Permission to speak, sir?

261
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,519
Sure, go ahead if you got something to say.

262
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:16,649
Like this is all a big mistake
and you wanna go home.

263
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:18,275
You wanna go home? Good.

264
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:19,355
Get the fuck out of here.
I'll drive you myself.

265
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,191
Not at all, sir.

266
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:22,321
I was gonna suggest we maybe
speed this whole thing up?

267
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:25,323
My guess is, if you and I go hand-to-hand,

268
00:24:25,414 --> 00:24:27,076
you could probably figure out
inside of 20 seconds

269
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,916
whether or not I have what it takes to
make it through your selection process.

270
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,252
So, what do you think?

271
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,549
We got an empty cot, empty footlocker.

272
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,347
They're both yours as long as you can last.

273
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:48,218
Sounds good.

274
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,928
Follow me.

275
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,264
See you out there.

276
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,599
Heard a lot about you, by the way.

277
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,183
Excited to see what you got.

278
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,281
Kill me.

279
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,465
People think you can slice
a man's throat like this.

280
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,713
That's only in the movies.

281
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:23,295
Right there.

282
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,213
Do it.

283
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:27,298
No noise. No mess.

284
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:36,728
Victor, you're up.

285
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,740
What the fuck, man?

286
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:53,700
Who grabs a fucking blade?

287
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,853
Come on, you fuckin' pussy. Let's go!

288
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,692
You gotta have eyes in
the back of your head.

289
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:30,658
You flinch, you die.

290
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,374
Orion is about the mission.

291
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,622
It ain't about you.

292
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,171
You go down out there, you're a ghost,
you don't exist.

293
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:47,595
There's nobody, nobody coming back for you.

294
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:54,682
You're about to be captured.

295
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:00,684
Bye-bye.

296
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:11,491
We now know 15 kilos of plutonium-239

297
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,196
went missing during the Russian breach.

298
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,408
It's enough to build
a full-scale nuclear weapon.

299
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:19,461
But that would likely require
the resources of a nation-state.

300
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:21,412
As Iranian Chief of General Staff,

301
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,373
I share your concern.

302
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:26,335
We have been monitoring
the situation as you have.

303
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:28,260
I'm afraid we too are in the dark.

304
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,430
For Iran, of course,

305
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,509
a nuclear weapon is off the table.

306
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,969
We have a treaty.

307
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:39,522
You have countrymen who are
not too happy about that.

308
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:42,976
We monitor your nuclear enrichment
program pretty closely,

309
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,813
but black market
plutonium-239 from Russia...

310
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:48,740
Would be difficult for inspectors to detect.

311
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,276
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

312
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,111
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:56,827
I assure you as Minister of Defense

314
00:27:56,917 --> 00:28:02,208
that we in Iran recognize
how much the spirit of comity

315
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:05,711
between our nations would be compromised

316
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:07,588
if we were to acquire

317
00:28:07,678 --> 00:28:09,715
weapons-grade plutonium from any source.

318
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,092
Yes, it would.

319
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:14,890
Same goes for your clients outside Iran,

320
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:16,593
Hezbollah. Hamas.

321
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:19,353
The Houthis.

322
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:23,149
Nuclear weapons are a danger
in any hands, Director.

323
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,101
Wasn't that your pretext for your invasion

324
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:26,811
of our neighbor to the west?

325
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,238
One that cost 500,000 Iraqi lives

326
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:30,690
and left a wake of destruction

327
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:32,616
from which our region has never recovered.

328
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:35,992
General Rostami, we came only
to tell you what we know.

329
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,536
Is that a threat?

330
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,420
Of course not, Minister Behruz.

331
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,089
Gentlemen, I very much
appreciate you meeting with us.

332
00:28:47,176 --> 00:28:48,667
Not at all.

333
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,002
I only wish we could offer more insight.

334
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,086
Thank you.

335
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:06,650
I don't trust General Rostami.

336
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:09,354
We need to keep this quiet.

337
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,485
How ready is Orion?

338
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,362
I'll check in with Hurley.

339
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,872
Why is there no one on watch?

340
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,539
You're all dead.

341
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,837
Yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.

342
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,835
You're dead.

343
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:32,043
What?

344
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,005
You wanna say something to me?
Say it. Go on, say it.

345
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:39,430
You got 30 seconds!

346
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,100
These are your targets.

347
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:50,023
Memorize them.

348
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:53,697
It's your responsibility
to be able to identify them.

349
00:29:53,784 --> 00:29:56,527
You shoot a combatant, you get a point.

350
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,577
You miss, you get a shock.

351
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:01,407
You shoot a noncombatant,
you get a bigger shock.

352
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,958
Combatant shoots you...

353
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:05,626
Let's just say you're gonna feel it.

354
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,620
Ready?

355
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:11,249
Go.

356
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:52,798
What's Hurley doing?

357
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,837
He's fucking with his head.

358
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:43,845
Fuck!

359
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,302
Fucking AR bullshit.

360
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:11,328
Shall we?

361
00:32:12,172 --> 00:32:13,288
Okay.

362
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:14,918
That's clever.

363
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:20,386
Raw plutonium.

364
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,054
Highly enriched, as promised.

365
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,551
Let's hope.

366
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:33,058
Wow, that's a beautiful sound, gentlemen.

367
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,226
May I?

368
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,946
Okay.

369
00:32:39,032 --> 00:32:40,489
Wire the money.

370
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,111
That, I can do.

371
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:45,949
This is a cell phone.

372
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:05,427
Okay.

373
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,390
It now appears that all seven victims
were shot with a single weapon,

374
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,350
believed to be a Glock 29.

375
00:33:57,444 --> 00:33:58,980
Traces of weaponized plutonium

376
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,436
were detected inside the van

377
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,146
where the bodies of three Russians

378
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,482
and two Warsaw police officers were found.

379
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,533
The Russian government has confirmed

380
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,328
that the chemical footprint
of the plutonium in question

381
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,326
is a match to the plutonium that was stolen

382
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,657
from the decommissioned

383
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,834
processing facility in Tobolsk.

384
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,833
Security footage is being
analyzed by Polish police,

385
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:20,040
now working in conjunction with Interpol,

386
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:22,125
to identify the shooter and his connection

387
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,755
to the missing plutonium.

388
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,837
The identity of the shooter
remains unknown...

389
00:34:58,421 --> 00:34:59,878
Hi, excuse me.

390
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,251
How can I help you? Question.

391
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:50,842
May I help you?

392
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:52,048
No, thanks. I'm okay.

393
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,745
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

394
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:16,322
Rapp! God damn it!

395
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:17,452
You have to stay under control.

396
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,532
Dickhead!

397
00:36:18,627 --> 00:36:19,743
Asshole doesn't know when to quit.

398
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,668
- You're kidding me, right?
- I just saved your ass.

399
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:23,667
You've gotta know when the mission's
been accomplished, Rapp.

400
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:25,293
- Sir, he's a fucking...
- Which he did.

401
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,467
Never assume your target is the only target.

402
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,465
The enemy dresses like a deer
and he kills like a lion.

403
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,762
And that's what we gotta do.

404
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,262
We just gotta do it better.

405
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,811
All right.

406
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,355
You're an asshole.

407
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,078
We got a problem.

408
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,534
Six weeks ago, there was a breach

409
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:03,836
at a decommissioned
Russian plutonium facility.

410
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,331
I'm aware.

411
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,337
What you don't know is 15 kilos
of plutonium went missing.

412
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,089
Weapons-grade.

413
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:12,966
That's a shit-ton of plutonium.

414
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:14,388
And it just changed hands.

415
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,302
I wanna show you something.

416
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:23,389
Take a look at this.

417
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,935
Does that face bong a gong for you?

418
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:28,394
Or is it just me?

419
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,365
It can't be him.

420
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,787
Our drones took him out after
the embassy bombing at Bamako.

421
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:40,489
We never got a positive ID.

422
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,700
That's our mad dog out there.

423
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:48,881
All right. Let's say it's him.

424
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,128
It's him, Irene.

425
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:53,256
This gives us a chance to kill
two birds with one stone.

426
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:57,556
Hamdi Sharif.

427
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,225
He's an arms dealer working out of Turkey.

428
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,054
Four days ago, he purchased
a Russian-designed nuclear trigger.

429
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,014
And he's gonna be selling it.

430
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,565
Sharif's got the honey.

431
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,859
Now we just wait for the bee.

432
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:11,107
We go in, we fuck up their deal.

433
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:15,358
And we take 'em both out.

434
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,496
You're going to Istanbul.

435
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,744
We have an agent in place.

436
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,950
She'll meet you at the airport.

437
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:25,079
All right.

438
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:28,041
Annika Ogden. We've had her
on the ground over there

439
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:29,872
for five years.

440
00:38:29,966 --> 00:38:31,628
I want Rapp on the team.

441
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:33,834
Really?

442
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:35,169
He's ready, Stan.

443
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:37,471
Actually, Irene, he's not ready.

444
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:40,883
But he will be.

445
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,890
You wanted to see me, sir?

446
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:49,941
Yeah. Shut the door.

447
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,605
We're shipping out.

448
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,780
Set those down there.

449
00:38:58,328 --> 00:38:59,318
You like movies?

450
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:01,153
Sure.

451
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,907
I got something for you.

452
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:06,117
What the fuck is this?

453
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,793
Yeah, I thought so.

454
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,121
- You thought so?
- Yeah.

455
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,298
Why are you even alive, Rapp?

456
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:15,922
You ever asked yourself that?

457
00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:20,757
Why you? You know, of all those people?

458
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,762
You're special, I guess.

459
00:39:22,852 --> 00:39:24,013
Oh, my God!

460
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,304
You want me to turn it up?

461
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,684
- I'll marry you!
- Take it!

462
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:31,483
You're a fucking coward, you know that?
Turn that shit off.

463
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,401
What do you think? It's my mom's ring.

464
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,024
You gonna turn it off?

465
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:37,447
Katrina!

466
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,029
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

467
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:44,988
I don't.

468
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,845
You made a big mistake.

469
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,014
You let emotion cloud your judgment.

470
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:07,474
Never, ever let it get personal.

471
00:40:07,564 --> 00:40:08,805
You understand?

472
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,574
Yeah, I got it.

473
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,156
Be ready to go by 5:00.

474
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,492
See you at 4:30.

475
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,593
You know what you're gonna do here?

476
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,671
- No, sir.
- Correct. You don't.

477
00:40:41,764 --> 00:40:43,300
So keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.

478
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:44,381
And wait for my orders.

479
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:19,421
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate
mogul/arms dealer.

480
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,593
He's like Santa Claus for terrorists.

481
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,050
Scumbag.

482
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,927
Spare me your junior-year-abroad

483
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,258
moral opinion, would you, Rapp?

484
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,969
Not really an opinion, sir.
Sharif's a piece of shit.

485
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:31,349
It's not a crusade.

486
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,556
This mission is practical. Don't make it...

487
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,766
Personal?

488
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,476
- Exactly.
- Yes, sir.

489
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,777
Victor, you're with me.

490
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,071
Rapp, you and Annika are eyes on.

491
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,400
Sharif has a routine.

492
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:45,735
Let's see if anything breaks his pattern.

493
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,820
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

494
00:41:47,914 --> 00:41:49,951
All right, we got 48 hours.

495
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,408
Quick, clean. No footprint.

496
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:54,334
This town's ready to blow as it is.

497
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:40,080
Where the hell are you going?

498
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,196
That was fucking reckless, Rapp.

499
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,319
I took the initiative, sir.

500
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:07,991
- He could've been made.
- Well, I wasn't.

501
00:43:09,746 --> 00:43:11,453
Here we go.

502
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:12,950
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

503
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,158
A meeting at a restaurant on Akbiyik Street.

504
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:18,244
That's right before Sharif
goes to see his mistress.

505
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:19,623
That breaks his pattern.

506
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:21,080
I'll tell you what'll break his pattern.

507
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:22,665
When that fucking assistant tells his boss

508
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:23,966
he lost his goddamn phone.

509
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:26,294
He won't.

510
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:29,050
He's too afraid of Sharif to let him know
he screwed up.

511
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,052
All right. We go tomorrow.

512
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,132
What's the mission, sir?

513
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:34,183
Eliminate the target.
Eliminate the recipient.

514
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,386
Obtain the package.

515
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,062
And what's the package?

516
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,184
We'll know it when we see it.

517
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:41,604
You're lead.

518
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:42,730
You're backup.

519
00:44:16,604 --> 00:44:18,470
He thinks we're married.

520
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,355
Don't think too much.

521
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:28,939
You'll lose your nerve.

522
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,233
No, I don't think so.

523
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,783
It'll be your first time.

524
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,326
Yeah, not in my mind.

525
00:44:58,104 --> 00:45:00,938
Lead, your friend's arriving now.

526
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:02,264
Copy.

527
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,655
And he brought a shitload
of military protection.

528
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,917
I'll take care of the MPs.

529
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,053
Oh, come on, now, honey. Don't be mad.

530
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,172
No, no, no.

531
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:36,507
I had a few. Yeah, I did.

532
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:37,842
I'll make it up to you when I get home.

533
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,346
You know that.

534
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:54,741
Call it in. Call it in,
or I'll cut your fucking throat.

535
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,059
Lead, you're a go.

536
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:28,017
Survey 2, get in place.

537
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:29,317
Be careful in there. I got it.

538
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,361
Pardon.

539
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,236
Target's gone. Target's gone.

540
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:01,694
Get back!

541
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,403
Lead?

542
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,030
Dead.

543
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:07,949
Mission terminated.

544
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:11,333
Exfil to secure location. Confirm.

545
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:15,757
Survey 2, you better let me
hear you fucking confirm.

546
00:48:15,843 --> 00:48:19,007
God damn it, this is a fucking mess.
We're out of here.

547
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,258
Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you.

548
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,265
I'm gonna hurt your boss.

549
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:49,926
Shit.

550
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,144
Hurry up!

551
00:50:08,622 --> 00:50:10,579
Come on, come on, come on.

552
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:21,875
Come on.

553
00:52:17,376 --> 00:52:18,492
No, please.

554
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,787
Please, don't. Don't.

555
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:25,623
No.

556
00:52:40,149 --> 00:52:41,936
You disobeyed a direct order.

557
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:45,272
No, I made a decision to pursue
the target, and I completed the mission.

558
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,149
And, sir, isn't that what I'm here to do?
Isn't that my job?

559
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:50,198
Your fucking job is to do
what I fucking tell you to do!

560
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:53,242
What, you prefer I leave him alive,
then, let him go? That piece of shit?

561
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:59,324
Stan?

562
00:52:59,418 --> 00:53:01,580
Good, you're here.
I wanna show you something.

563
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,660
Wait here.

564
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:08,921
Look at that. That's the kind
of bullshit that could shut us down.

565
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:11,048
Kid can't even follow a fucking order.

566
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:13,095
Victor got made. Rapp didn't.

567
00:53:13,182 --> 00:53:15,549
Why does this kid give you
such a fucking hard-on?

568
00:53:15,643 --> 00:53:17,555
Don't talk to me like that!
I'm your superior.

569
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:18,635
My superior, Irene?

570
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,186
Your superior, God damn it.

571
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,648
Do you have any idea
how long I spent looking

572
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,566
for someone with that
kid's talent and balls?

573
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,644
Rapp stays.

574
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,229
You're giving me an order?

575
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:30,404
That's an affirmative.

576
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:33,570
Can you give us a minute?

577
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:38,788
Look at this.

578
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:42,541
The trigger must have been in that car.

579
00:53:46,674 --> 00:53:48,666
Look at him.

580
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,091
Lookin' at me.

581
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,173
Everything he did there,

582
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:54,470
I taught him how to do it.

583
00:53:54,556 --> 00:53:56,343
Stan.

584
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,516
I should've left him in the Navy.

585
00:53:58,602 --> 00:53:59,843
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

586
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,053
Stan, listen to me.

587
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:04,063
The only thing that matters now is that
fucking lunatic has everything he needs

588
00:54:04,149 --> 00:54:05,185
to build a nuclear weapon.

589
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:10,691
He's got a trigger.
Now he needs to buy a physicist.

590
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:14,365
We just have to figure out
where they're gonna build this thing.

591
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,909
Ben.

592
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:19,863
That computer our boy Rapp
lifted from Sharif's house,

593
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:23,200
there's evidence of a $2 million
transfer to a bank account in Rome.

594
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,909
Cash prepped for withdrawal.

595
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:26,039
Rome.

596
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,212
Your money.

597
00:55:51,298 --> 00:55:54,666
I've been reading up, Minister.

598
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,878
You Iranians probably
all learn this growing up,

599
00:55:57,971 --> 00:56:00,088
or at least you did before
you signed that treaty.

600
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,467
But me, I had no idea about these fun facts.

601
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,221
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

602
00:56:10,776 --> 00:56:13,894
Inside three miles,
apparently you just vaporize.

603
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:16,149
Some folks don't.

604
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,323
They get all black and charred,

605
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:22,527
and dense as lead, and no one knows why.

606
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:26,080
Inside five miles,
everything is sucked into a void,

607
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:28,374
hotter than the core of the sun.

608
00:56:31,338 --> 00:56:32,795
How about that?

609
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,877
You'll get the rest of your money
when the job's done.

610
00:56:42,474 --> 00:56:44,261
Where is my physicist?

611
00:56:44,351 --> 00:56:46,638
He'll pick up his money,
then we'll pick him up.

612
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:52,016
We'll need an extra day to configure
the weapon, then it's all yours.

613
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:54,271
Kill as many Jews as you want.

614
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:01,279
Do you practice Salah, brother?

615
00:57:01,368 --> 00:57:04,736
I receive my payment, complete the project.

616
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:08,414
That's my practice, brother.

617
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,536
Very well.

618
00:57:42,743 --> 00:57:43,859
Who was that guy?

619
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,826
In Istanbul.

620
00:57:48,332 --> 00:57:50,870
It seemed like he was a step ahead of us.

621
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,624
Hey, you gonna fill me in here or what?

622
00:57:55,714 --> 00:57:58,047
There's some bad people planning
on doing some bad things,

623
00:57:58,133 --> 00:57:59,340
and it's our job to stop them.

624
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:04,133
You still haven't said
anything about Victor.

625
00:58:04,222 --> 00:58:06,805
Victor's gone. Victor doesn't exist.

626
00:58:12,606 --> 00:58:14,848
What is it you think we do here, Rapp?

627
00:58:18,278 --> 00:58:20,110
I think we kill people
who need to be killed.

628
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:21,187
And who do you trust to tell you?

629
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:22,613
I follow orders.

630
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,406
No, you follow orders when they suit you.

631
00:58:24,493 --> 00:58:25,825
This whole thing is pretty much

632
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:28,779
just a means to an end for you, isn't it?

633
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,329
A lot's happened in my life, sir.

634
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:32,372
- Really? Huh.
- Yeah.

635
00:58:32,459 --> 00:58:33,700
So you think you were sent here

636
00:58:33,794 --> 00:58:36,127
as an outlet for your self-pity,

637
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:39,377
and your anger, and all your guilt. Right?

638
00:58:40,759 --> 00:58:42,716
Patriotism exists

639
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:46,797
because people like you and people
like me need a higher cause.

640
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,007
Something bigger than us.

641
00:58:49,101 --> 00:58:50,967
That stink coming outta you

642
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,895
you like to call "revenge,"
the rest of us call "shit."

643
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:55,563
And as soon as it starts to feel good,

644
00:58:55,649 --> 00:58:57,356
that's when you stop being a professional.

645
00:58:57,442 --> 00:58:58,683
And then what are you?

646
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:06,984
Tell us something good, darling.

647
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,864
We're in their system.

648
00:59:10,956 --> 00:59:14,996
The moment that transfer from
Sharif's account is picked up,

649
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,951
we'll know it.

650
00:59:17,045 --> 00:59:19,879
Boy, you just smile, and the Red Sea parts.

651
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:23,082
Works in the Med, too.

652
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:25,668
I'll bet it does.

653
00:59:39,484 --> 00:59:43,023
Cash withdrawal from Sharif's account.
$2 million, U.S.

654
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,853
There's our physicist. Let's go.

655
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,703
Welcome to the Boscolo and enjoy your stay.

656
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:17,371
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

657
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,999
He's in 1448.

658
01:01:28,093 --> 01:01:29,800
And we're next door.

659
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,782
Code in.

660
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:01,912
Victor-Charlie 1109.

661
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:03,664
Confirmed.

662
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,961
Suite 1448. We're in 1449, right next door.

663
01:02:07,299 --> 01:02:09,040
All right. We'll grab the physicist,

664
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:11,296
and we'll take out whosever coming for him.

665
01:02:11,386 --> 01:02:12,922
Signal every 15 minutes.

666
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:55,678
Hey.

667
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,106
I know what happened to you.

668
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:10,772
I'm sorry.

669
01:03:17,786 --> 01:03:19,493
I understand you.

670
01:03:20,455 --> 01:03:22,037
More than you know.

671
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:37,420
I know what it's like
to lose people you love.

672
01:03:42,435 --> 01:03:44,848
We're gonna get these fuckers.

673
01:03:57,492 --> 01:03:58,482
Fuck!

674
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:03,992
Where the hell are you?

675
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:25,968
Hurley...

676
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:27,519
Where is he?

677
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,351
I don't know what you're talking...

678
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,832
Where is he?

679
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:50,667
He outside?

680
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:38,628
Please, no.

681
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:42,461
Please.

682
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:46,632
Hurley, what the fuck?

683
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:48,137
I thought you were eyes on,
why didn't you spot 'em?

684
01:05:48,228 --> 01:05:50,561
They were already in the damn hotel.

685
01:05:50,647 --> 01:05:52,104
Local mafia's working with 'em.

686
01:06:02,742 --> 01:06:04,654
I'll tell Kennedy we have the physicist.

687
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:10,581
What the hell just happened out there, huh?

688
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,374
That's twice now this guy's
blown up our entire op.

689
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,873
What's the target? Huh? What's the target?

690
01:06:14,963 --> 01:06:16,079
- I don't know, mister.
- Yeah, you do.

691
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,751
Huh?

692
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:19,832
Do you think I'm stupid?

693
01:06:19,926 --> 01:06:21,588
He's an American. He said your name.

694
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:23,089
Did you train this guy?

695
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:26,422
- You like to smoke?
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

696
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:27,973
- Are you a smoker?
- I don't...

697
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:29,800
- Wait!
- Bad habit.

698
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:32,261
Wait, stop! Wait, wait! I know something.

699
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,812
- What do you know?
- I know something.

700
01:06:33,898 --> 01:06:37,687
There is a man... There is
a man they call Ghost.

701
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:41,771
Ghost. I think it was
an Iranian man said it.

702
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:42,855
Uh-huh. Where are they building the bomb?

703
01:06:42,949 --> 01:06:44,235
- I just took the money.
- Where are they building it?

704
01:06:44,325 --> 01:06:46,191
Where are they building it?

705
01:06:46,286 --> 01:06:48,118
All right, here.
Take some time to think about it.

706
01:06:49,956 --> 01:06:51,572
Ghost. Is that his name?

707
01:06:53,001 --> 01:06:55,209
Why is this guy after you?

708
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:56,957
Something personal, sir?

709
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,662
They're building a nuke.

710
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,710
Hotel Navona.

711
01:07:03,803 --> 01:07:05,510
- Clean yourself up.
- Wait.

712
01:07:05,597 --> 01:07:07,930
Don't go.

713
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:10,808
America's president
has ordered the Sixth Fleet

714
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:13,136
out of the U.S. Naval base in Naples, Italy.

715
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,687
The Sixth Fleet is now
southwest off the coast...

716
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,182
Let me help you.

717
01:07:18,276 --> 01:07:19,483
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

718
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:20,810
You're not.

719
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:40,795
How are you holding up?

720
01:07:44,344 --> 01:07:46,927
I was afraid today.

721
01:07:47,013 --> 01:07:49,756
I thought we were going to die.

722
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:52,091
Yeah, I'm either always afraid
or never afraid.

723
01:07:52,185 --> 01:07:53,676
I don't know which.

724
01:08:10,578 --> 01:08:12,240
There you go.

725
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:20,578
Just relax now.

726
01:08:24,384 --> 01:08:26,341
We'll search for Ghost tomorrow.

727
01:08:42,777 --> 01:08:43,984
You scared me.

728
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:45,902
Who are you?

729
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:47,070
What do you mean?

730
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,398
You said "Ghost."

731
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,654
- What about him?
- I never told you that name.

732
01:08:51,744 --> 01:08:53,201
Hurley did.

733
01:08:53,288 --> 01:08:55,120
Yeah, I think you're full of shit.

734
01:08:55,206 --> 01:08:56,492
- Mitch.
- Who are you?

735
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:58,245
- Mitch, what's wrong with you?
- Who do you work for?

736
01:08:58,876 --> 01:09:00,412
I'm CIA.

737
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,620
Now don't fucking lie to me!

738
01:09:02,714 --> 01:09:03,830
I'm not lying!

739
01:09:05,383 --> 01:09:06,999
You're Iranian, aren't you?

740
01:09:07,093 --> 01:09:08,425
Get the fuck away from me!

741
01:09:19,272 --> 01:09:20,638
Are you working with the Iranians?

742
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,733
Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth!

743
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,035
You Iranian intelligence?

744
01:09:39,125 --> 01:09:41,208
Are you Iranian intelligence?

745
01:09:49,677 --> 01:09:51,714
What do you know about Ghost?

746
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:13,440
We're gonna need the decryption device.

747
01:10:19,457 --> 01:10:20,993
You were right, Mitch.

748
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,542
This Iranian mole is a tough nut to crack.

749
01:10:23,628 --> 01:10:25,961
All I could get from her
was her handler. Azad Ashani.

750
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,254
Happens to be a friend of mine.

751
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,706
I'm gonna go pay him a visit.

752
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,008
- Okay, I'm going with you.
- No.

753
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:32,551
I need you to stay here.

754
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:34,253
Kennedy's on her way with the CIA team

755
01:10:34,347 --> 01:10:35,337
and a Mossad team.

756
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,638
She's gonna ask me where you went.

757
01:10:36,724 --> 01:10:37,714
What the hell am I supposed to say?

758
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:39,471
That's right, she is.
And you're gonna be smart,

759
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,514
and you're gonna keep your mouth shut,
and you're gonna cover my ass.

760
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,621
I still have it.

761
01:11:11,509 --> 01:11:13,091
Very nice.

762
01:11:14,887 --> 01:11:17,675
I am always happy to meet you, Stan...

763
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:22,594
But never happy why.

764
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:25,304
Well, maybe next time we'll meet for pizza.

765
01:11:25,398 --> 01:11:26,434
Your girl's tough, by the way.

766
01:11:29,527 --> 01:11:31,234
Go easy on her.

767
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,401
She's my niece.

768
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,106
Yeah.

769
01:11:42,749 --> 01:11:43,990
What have you got for me?

770
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:48,327
The men behind all this are General Rostami,

771
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:50,834
our military chief of staff,

772
01:11:50,923 --> 01:11:53,711
and our defense minister, Behruz.

773
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:55,963
Both are very powerful,

774
01:11:56,053 --> 01:12:00,172
and both are very angry about
the nuclear treaty we made with you.

775
01:12:00,266 --> 01:12:02,053
They have been trying to acquire

776
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:04,931
nuclear materials for the past two years.

777
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:06,228
And they are the ones

778
01:12:06,314 --> 01:12:09,182
who hired the mercenary called Ghost.

779
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:15,146
Rostami is now in Tehran,
but Behruz is here in Rome.

780
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:20,109
Annika has been tracking
his movements through his cell phone.

781
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:21,319
And they're building it here?

782
01:12:21,412 --> 01:12:22,994
I wish I knew.

783
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,701
We have their physicist.

784
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:26,782
They can't build it without him.

785
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:27,866
But...

786
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,916
The mercenary asked Behruz

787
01:12:32,006 --> 01:12:34,749
to use one of ours, an Iranian.

788
01:12:34,842 --> 01:12:38,506
Behruz agreed. That was rash.

789
01:12:38,596 --> 01:12:40,383
It means they are in a hurry.

790
01:12:43,309 --> 01:12:45,175
And the target's Israel?

791
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:47,135
I wish I had better information for you.

792
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,153
Where the hell is Hurley?

793
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,822
You gotta tell me what's going on here. Now.

794
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,820
That guy he trained, who the hell is he?

795
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,651
That's not something you
need to know right now.

796
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:04,737
What are you covering up?

797
01:13:04,831 --> 01:13:06,788
When you've got a level-5 security clearance

798
01:13:06,874 --> 01:13:08,365
and 20 years' experience, talk to me.

799
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:10,291
Until then, shut up and do your job.

800
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:18,417
I want her cell phone decrypted and scanned.

801
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:20,218
Local PD pulled a body
from the harbor an hour ago.

802
01:13:20,304 --> 01:13:21,294
Gunshot to the chest.

803
01:13:21,389 --> 01:13:23,847
Iranian intelligence officer, Azad Ashani.

804
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,175
Christ!

805
01:13:26,269 --> 01:13:27,931
That's the guy Hurley went to meet.

806
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,932
Stupid son of a bitch!

807
01:13:30,022 --> 01:13:31,604
All right, so what do we do?
We gotta go after him.

808
01:13:31,691 --> 01:13:33,933
There's a fucking nuke in play, Rapp.

809
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:37,315
That's the mission, and the only mission.

810
01:13:37,405 --> 01:13:39,021
This is now a joint CIA-Mossad operation,

811
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,401
whether we like it or not.

812
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:41,732
Can you get the Director on the phone?

813
01:13:41,826 --> 01:13:43,943
So you're just gonna write him off then?

814
01:13:44,036 --> 01:13:45,777
That's the plan?

815
01:13:45,872 --> 01:13:48,034
Stan Hurley is the closest
thing to family I've got.

816
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:50,414
And if he were standing here
right now, his only question would be,

817
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:52,333
why are we wasting our breath
talking about him?

818
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,496
You're through here.

819
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,001
You're going home, that's an order.

820
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:00,466
Now, sit down and shut up.

821
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,058
Why are you helping me?

822
01:14:54,148 --> 01:14:56,014
Your handler Ashani was killed.

823
01:14:56,108 --> 01:14:57,815
Hurley was with him. Something happened.

824
01:14:57,902 --> 01:14:58,938
I'm going after him.

825
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:02,983
I need your help.

826
01:15:05,326 --> 01:15:06,316
We gotta go.

827
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:33,886
Stan.

828
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:36,097
I've looked forward to this.

829
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:38,102
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

830
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:40,813
I wanna show you something.

831
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,269
All right.

832
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,746
Savages. Right, Stan?

833
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:01,213
But you know something? I don't blame them.

834
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:03,623
I blame you.

835
01:16:03,718 --> 01:16:06,380
Never would've happened if you
would have followed orders, Ronnie.

836
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:08,427
"You go down out there, you're a ghost.

837
01:16:08,514 --> 01:16:09,846
"You're a John Doe.

838
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:12,174
"You get captured?"

839
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:14,635
Oh, you remember. That's very gratifying.

840
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:15,719
Thank you.

841
01:16:15,813 --> 01:16:17,304
You made me proud today, Ron.

842
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,391
You should've come for me.

843
01:16:23,195 --> 01:16:24,356
Ten men would've died.

844
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,813
You put 10 men's lives in danger,

845
01:16:25,906 --> 01:16:27,863
'cause you couldn't follow a fucking order.

846
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,236
- Fuck you.
- Fuck orders.

847
01:16:29,326 --> 01:16:30,908
- Fuck the mission!
- Fuck you.

848
01:16:30,995 --> 01:16:33,362
This was me. I was your boy, I believe that.

849
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:34,492
You made me believe that.

850
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:48,134
Ashani had their people tracking
Minister Behruz's secure cell phone.

851
01:16:49,722 --> 01:16:51,304
So, we find Behruz, we find Hurley.

852
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,231
Mitch!

853
01:17:50,741 --> 01:17:52,653
Oh, yeah, look at that.

854
01:17:52,743 --> 01:17:54,279
Did you learn that in Aleppo?

855
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:55,702
No.

856
01:17:55,788 --> 01:17:57,780
You always told us what to expect, Stan.

857
01:18:03,003 --> 01:18:05,954
Now, where's the rest of your team?

858
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:08,999
Come on, Ronnie, really?

859
01:18:09,093 --> 01:18:10,834
Don't call me that.
Where's the rest of your team?

860
01:18:10,928 --> 01:18:13,386
Your new boy out there, he on my tail?

861
01:18:13,472 --> 01:18:16,681
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
There's your first mistake.

862
01:18:16,767 --> 01:18:19,680
You never start with a real question.

863
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:21,853
You start slow.

864
01:18:21,939 --> 01:18:23,726
You get inside your subject's head.

865
01:18:23,816 --> 01:18:27,480
Stan, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

866
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:30,233
There's your second mistake. Number two.

867
01:18:30,322 --> 01:18:33,065
You don't say, "one more time."
You already...

868
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:34,866
Damn!

869
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,164
Now, what's that third mistake, Stan?

870
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,116
Huh? What is it?

871
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,042
Go ahead! Go ahead!

872
01:18:45,129 --> 01:18:47,462
I got nine more! I like this.

873
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:49,881
I like it. Go ahead, bring it on!

874
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:51,083
You motherfucker!

875
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,509
Ronnie wants to know if
I got a team outside.

876
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:57,715
Right, Ron?

877
01:18:57,808 --> 01:18:59,265
If it's safe to move your bomb.

878
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,011
Are we being followed?

879
01:19:04,523 --> 01:19:06,435
Where's the new me?

880
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:08,938
I've done my research. I know all about him.

881
01:19:09,028 --> 01:19:11,566
"The new me..." Oh, you mean Mitch?

882
01:19:11,655 --> 01:19:13,863
You know, Mitch, he's unpredictable.

883
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,531
You never know about Mitch.

884
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,029
He might be here, he might be there.

885
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,781
He's like you, but you're a real Section 8.

886
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:19,861
Enough.

887
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,072
- Schizo mom.
- Where are they?

888
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:23,702
- Loser dad.
- Where are they?

889
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,077
God!

890
01:19:30,549 --> 01:19:31,960
Where's the rest of your team?

891
01:19:32,051 --> 01:19:33,542
Half-wit mom, psycho dad...

892
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:34,752
Where's the rest of your team?

893
01:19:34,845 --> 01:19:36,211
- You're pond scum.
- Where are they?

894
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:38,547
Pond scum! You're fucking...

895
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:50,691
I'm sorry about your handler.

896
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:53,103
Ashani was my uncle.

897
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,073
I'm sure it was Minister Behruz

898
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,651
and General Rostami who had him killed.

899
01:19:59,745 --> 01:20:02,829
They want nuclear war with Israel.

900
01:20:02,915 --> 01:20:04,656
We tried to stop them.

901
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,458
My brother and father
both died fighting them.

902
01:20:10,714 --> 01:20:12,296
Corviale. Turn here.

903
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,129
You know what my real mistake was?

904
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,515
I trusted you.

905
01:20:22,601 --> 01:20:25,560
You made me feel like
I was the Second Coming.

906
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,393
And you acted like my father.

907
01:20:32,236 --> 01:20:35,946
I trusted you and I trusted
the United States Navy.

908
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:47,829
U.S. of A. does it, it's gotta be good.
Right, Stan?

909
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:49,917
Except

910
01:20:50,004 --> 01:20:53,168
nobody told me the business
y'all are really in.

911
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:58,339
You create monsters.

912
01:20:58,429 --> 01:20:59,795
That's just what you do.

913
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:03,469
Those people who did this to me,

914
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:05,721
you think they're barbarians?

915
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:07,556
Bullshit.

916
01:21:15,195 --> 01:21:17,232
Where's the decryption I asked for?

917
01:21:17,323 --> 01:21:20,157
Rapp grabbed her smartphone
before we could get any of it.

918
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:22,359
And we can't find him.

919
01:21:22,453 --> 01:21:24,160
Surveillance cameras picked up Rapp

920
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,238
taking out our agents five minutes ago.

921
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,372
What the hell are you doing?

922
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,586
There's not a single thing happening here

923
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,887
that you didn't make happen.

924
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:48,301
God bless fucking America, huh, Stan?

925
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,095
Hoorah!

926
01:21:52,524 --> 01:21:54,106
Hoorah!

927
01:21:55,486 --> 01:21:57,273
I can tell you where Mitch is...

928
01:21:57,363 --> 01:22:00,197
What's that third mistake, Stan?

929
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:01,272
Mitch...

930
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:02,357
I can't hear you.

931
01:22:03,535 --> 01:22:04,525
Fuck!

932
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,782
Third mistake,

933
01:22:10,876 --> 01:22:13,539
never get too close.

934
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,712
Finish your personal business here.

935
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,130
Your work is done.

936
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,673
The bomb is armed.

937
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:20,341
- Timer is set up?
- Yes.

938
01:22:20,427 --> 01:22:21,417
He's playing you.

939
01:22:21,512 --> 01:22:23,595
Bomb's not for you, it's for him.

940
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,262
It was his plan all along!

941
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:58,664
Dead zone.

942
01:22:58,757 --> 01:23:01,044
We're not getting any signals here.

943
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:08,472
Come on. Come on.

944
01:23:12,604 --> 01:23:14,266
Wait a second.

945
01:23:38,589 --> 01:23:40,455
What are you gonna do with it?

946
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:41,960
No, Stan.

947
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,671
"What are we gonna do with it?"

948
01:23:47,931 --> 01:23:50,014
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

949
01:23:50,559 --> 01:23:52,551
I like Rome.

950
01:23:52,644 --> 01:23:53,680
It's good food.

951
01:23:58,609 --> 01:24:01,898
Never, ever thought I'd die in the field.

952
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,195
Ain't it crazy?

953
01:24:05,282 --> 01:24:08,241
I always figured it would be, I don't know,

954
01:24:08,327 --> 01:24:12,697
some cabin in the woods with my dog.

955
01:24:12,789 --> 01:24:14,371
Me?

956
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,700
I think I want water.

957
01:24:16,793 --> 01:24:19,877
There's just something
peaceful about dying at sea.

958
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,876
All right.

959
01:24:28,347 --> 01:24:29,508
Let's get it over with.

960
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:31,840
No, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

961
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:32,970
I ain't gonna kill you.

962
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:35,222
You're gonna live to see

963
01:24:35,312 --> 01:24:37,224
the crown of your creation, Stan.

964
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:41,437
Thousands of Americans are gonna burn.

965
01:24:42,361 --> 01:24:44,227
All because of you.

966
01:24:45,906 --> 01:24:47,397
Enjoy the show.

967
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:50,525
Get ready.

968
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:31,691
Go.

969
01:26:43,482 --> 01:26:45,018
Please help me.

970
01:26:46,193 --> 01:26:47,775
Annika.

971
01:27:05,879 --> 01:27:06,869
Whoa!

972
01:28:18,618 --> 01:28:20,405
We've got an explosion detected.

973
01:28:21,037 --> 01:28:22,494
Here.

974
01:28:22,581 --> 01:28:24,618
A half click off the Fiumicino waterways.

975
01:28:25,751 --> 01:28:27,117
It's underground.

976
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,917
- Delta One, go!
- Let's go.

977
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:30,620
Get a chopper out there.

978
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,986
You're not supposed to be here, Rapp.

979
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,946
Yeah, what are you gonna do, fire me?

980
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:08,499
There's another passage down there.
He's got the nuke.

981
01:29:08,585 --> 01:29:10,702
- You gonna be good?
- Go. Go!

982
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,159
Put the gun down.

983
01:29:52,254 --> 01:29:53,870
Or she's dead.

984
01:29:55,966 --> 01:29:57,958
I want to see my family, Mitch.

985
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,844
No, Annika, you don't.

986
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:03,387
I want to see my family.

987
01:30:03,473 --> 01:30:05,510
Come on, Mitch. Be nice.

988
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,091
She wants to live.

989
01:30:07,185 --> 01:30:09,302
She wants to see her family.

990
01:30:09,396 --> 01:30:10,386
Put the gun down.

991
01:30:14,025 --> 01:30:15,015
Annika!

992
01:32:12,477 --> 01:32:14,093
The bomb can't be stopped.

993
01:32:14,187 --> 01:32:15,473
Just like you couldn't stop

994
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:18,146
that beautiful girl from dying on the beach.

995
01:32:22,862 --> 01:32:24,023
Irene.

996
01:32:25,532 --> 01:32:27,068
The bomb's on a boat.

997
01:32:27,158 --> 01:32:28,399
Hurley?

998
01:32:28,493 --> 01:32:29,700
How do you know?

999
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:32,278
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

1000
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:38,541
Is the Sixth Fleet out on maneuvers?

1001
01:32:41,172 --> 01:32:42,208
Oh, my God.

1002
01:32:42,298 --> 01:32:43,288
Bring up ISR feeds.

1003
01:32:43,383 --> 01:32:45,045
Get me eyes in the sky over the coastline

1004
01:32:45,135 --> 01:32:47,718
and put the Sixth Fleet on nuclear alert.

1005
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:49,211
Tom.

1006
01:32:49,305 --> 01:32:52,764
The target is the Sixth Fleet
and it's 25 miles offshore.

1007
01:33:00,066 --> 01:33:01,682
It's a shame.

1008
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:06,111
The last thing your girl saw
was you not saving her.

1009
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:19,120
General quarters.

1010
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:21,042
All hands, man your stations.

1011
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:24,042
This is not a drill.
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1012
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:26,875
Inbound, small vessel-borne nuclear device.

1013
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:28,425
Man decon stations.

1014
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:35,888
Didn't Hurley teach you
anything, little brother?

1015
01:33:41,775 --> 01:33:43,892
To never make it personal.

1016
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:56,699
This isn't personal.

1017
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:05,708
Shit.

1018
01:34:07,258 --> 01:34:10,296
The bomb has a timer and a release trigger.

1019
01:34:10,386 --> 01:34:13,003
We take out his boat, it'll detonate.

1020
01:34:13,098 --> 01:34:15,010
If it goes off above the waterline...

1021
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,968
Disaster. There'll be fallout
all over the mainland.

1022
01:34:21,523 --> 01:34:22,639
USS Flynn...

1023
01:34:22,732 --> 01:34:24,519
Prepare to engage.

1024
01:34:35,453 --> 01:34:36,785
The boat is turning, sir.

1025
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:38,407
Who's driving that boat?

1026
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:42,866
Rapp.

1027
01:34:46,089 --> 01:34:47,079
Go.

1028
01:34:47,173 --> 01:34:49,085
Sir? Go!

1029
01:34:56,641 --> 01:34:59,304
What are you doing? Hurley.

1030
01:34:59,394 --> 01:35:00,475
Hurley?

1031
01:35:00,562 --> 01:35:02,554
Trying to get our boy to throw
the bomb in the water.

1032
01:35:02,647 --> 01:35:05,640
Flynn, you are clear to fire when ready.

1033
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:08,601
Do not fire, Commander. The boat is turning.

1034
01:35:08,695 --> 01:35:11,483
If we don't engage,
that guarantees detonation.

1035
01:35:11,573 --> 01:35:12,814
I understand there's a risk,

1036
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:14,318
but this is the best chance we've got.

1037
01:35:14,409 --> 01:35:16,366
Shit! God damn it!

1038
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:26,167
There he is.

1039
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:28,291
Get me on that boat's marine bandwidth.

1040
01:35:32,177 --> 01:35:33,167
Rapp!

1041
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:35,464
Rapp!

1042
01:35:35,555 --> 01:35:38,047
Can you hear me? Pick up the radio!

1043
01:35:38,141 --> 01:35:40,929
Throw the bomb overboard!

1044
01:35:41,019 --> 01:35:43,181
No way, sir, I gotta get
further away from the fleet!

1045
01:35:43,271 --> 01:35:44,682
Rapp!

1046
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:47,310
For once in your life, take a goddamn order!

1047
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,312
The Sixth Fleet is about
to blow you to hell!

1048
01:36:00,538 --> 01:36:02,404
Command, Delta Two,

1049
01:36:02,498 --> 01:36:03,784
the bomb's in the water.

1050
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:06,333
Commander, hold your fire!
The bomb's in the water.

1051
01:36:06,419 --> 01:36:08,285
Flynn, hold fire!

1052
01:36:08,379 --> 01:36:09,369
Hold fire!

1053
01:36:09,464 --> 01:36:10,875
Hold fire!

1054
01:36:41,037 --> 01:36:42,903
Got less than 30 seconds.

1055
01:36:46,793 --> 01:36:47,874
All right, go! Get outta here!

1056
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:09,555
Jesus.

1057
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:51,638
Brace for impact.

1058
01:37:51,733 --> 01:37:53,019
Sir, yes, sir!

1059
01:37:57,447 --> 01:37:59,939
Holy shit.

1060
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:41,655
Hold on!

1061
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:55,911
Brace!

1062
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:38,787
You shouldn't have come for me.

1063
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,587
Don't get used to it, son.

1064
01:39:45,012 --> 01:39:47,504
Hurley...

1065
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:49,931
Looks like we're gonna be all right up here.

1066
01:39:50,768 --> 01:39:51,758
I think.

1067
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:59,225
Damage control central. Report.

1068
01:39:59,318 --> 01:40:00,684
Pressure is normalizing.

1069
01:40:00,778 --> 01:40:02,861
We have multiple hull breaches.

1070
01:40:02,947 --> 01:40:04,609
Radiologicals, Eisenhower?

1071
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:06,565
Low... Low levels.

1072
01:40:07,952 --> 01:40:10,194
Initiating countermeasure wash-down.

1073
01:40:10,288 --> 01:40:12,120
Commander, any casualties?

1074
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:14,072
The Flynn took some serious damage.

1075
01:40:14,167 --> 01:40:16,033
The casualty reports aren't in yet,

1076
01:40:16,127 --> 01:40:19,086
but if it had gone off above
the waterline, I don't think we'd be here.

1077
01:40:19,172 --> 01:40:20,583
Eisenhower,

1078
01:40:21,674 --> 01:40:23,791
my prayers are with you all.

1079
01:40:44,655 --> 01:40:47,523
Hurley, is Rapp there?

1080
01:40:48,534 --> 01:40:49,741
Hold on a minute.

1081
01:40:54,874 --> 01:40:55,955
Yeah, go ahead.

1082
01:40:56,042 --> 01:40:57,533
You okay, Mitch?

1083
01:40:57,627 --> 01:40:59,368
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

1084
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:06,587
You saved a lot of lives today.

1085
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:09,962
Took some losses, too.

1086
01:42:14,078 --> 01:42:16,741
What the hell are you looking at?

1087
01:42:16,831 --> 01:42:18,538
You look like a mummy.

1088
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,990
Yeah.

1089
01:42:20,084 --> 01:42:22,076
Well...

1090
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:24,252
A mummy doesn't have to write up reports.

1091
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:26,705
Dictate them. You should be good at that.

1092
01:42:28,884 --> 01:42:30,420
Iranian official, General Rostami,

1093
01:42:30,511 --> 01:42:32,377
the leader of the minority
opposition in Tehran,

1094
01:42:32,471 --> 01:42:34,884
claims that he has proof that a secret group

1095
01:42:34,974 --> 01:42:37,216
of assassins within America's CIA

1096
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:39,927
are responsible for
last week's nuclear event.

1097
01:42:40,021 --> 01:42:43,063
With the Iranian presidential election
just two weeks away,

1098
01:42:43,149 --> 01:42:46,893
General Rostami continues
to rise in popularity.

1099
01:42:46,986 --> 01:42:50,270
They say General Rostami is
gonna be the next President of Iran.

1100
01:42:50,364 --> 01:42:51,445
Yeah.

1101
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:53,899
He didn't even have to blow
up Israel to get there.

1102
01:42:53,993 --> 01:42:55,905
He's gonna be a major pain in the ass, too.

1103
01:42:55,995 --> 01:42:58,408
Where's Rapp? I can't reach him.

1104
01:42:58,497 --> 01:43:00,238
How the hell do I know where Rapp is?

1105
01:43:00,333 --> 01:43:01,619
I'm a mummy in a hospital.

1106
01:43:01,709 --> 01:43:04,122
Rostami has full support for restarting

1107
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:05,918
Iran's nuclear program.
