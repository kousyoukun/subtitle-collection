1
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:47,970


2
00:00:48,870 --> 00:01:00,870


3
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,670
Here we are in beautiful
Ibiza, Spain.

4
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,170
Beautiful sand.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,670
Beautiful waves.

6
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,080
My favorite shorts.

7
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,110
And my favorite girl
who is about to get...

8
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,180
Oh, my God!

9
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,080
Hey!

10
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,890
- Come on, give it to me.
- No! Stop! Come on!

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,180
- Mitch!
- This is great!

12
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,690
I'm serious.

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,460
Oh. Oh, my God.
That is so cute.

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,990
Honey, this is like...

15
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,560
Let me film for just
a couple minutes.

16
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,730
- It's like we're honeymooners.
- Oh, my God!

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,530
♪ Honeymooners ♪

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,580
"Honeymoon"?

19
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,600
Yeah.

20
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,070
We're not married.

21
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,770
Katrina Harper...

22
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,480
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,550
Oh, my God. Babe, stop it.
You're gonna make me...

24
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,280
If you get emotional,
you're gonna kill me.

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,620
I'm trying to get
through this, babe.

26
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,790
I love you, more than anything.

27
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,960
Will you marry me?

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,260
Oh, my God!

29
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,000
- Yes!
- Yeah?

30
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,560
Yes, Mitch Rapp.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,870
I'll marry you.

32
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,970
Sorry, it's hard one-handed.

33
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,070
You like it? It was
my mom's ring.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
I love it.

35
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,180
I love you.

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,300
- I'm still...
- Are you filming? Oh, my God!

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,060
Yeah, I'm still recording.
I'm trying to get this.

38
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,820
Come on, Mitch!

39
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,560
This is why I was filming
now. You see, now you get it.

40
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,660
Smile.

41
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm gonna get drinks.

42
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,670
- Okay.
- Yeah?

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,730
Don't be too long.

44
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,970
I won't, I won't.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,070
I love you.

46
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,140
I love you.

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,170
I'll be back.

48
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,610
Engagement drinks in
the water, people.

49
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,710
Whoo-hoo!

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,950
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

51
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,120
Very sweet, thanks. Babe,
we're getting applause.

52
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,960
I love you.

53
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,220
Thank you.

54
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,640
Hola. Como estas?

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,940
What can I get you?

56
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,100
Um, can I just get
two drinks, please?

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,210
Dos bebidas, if that's right...

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,920
Um, I just got engaged,
so something special.

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,040
It can be anything, though.

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,310
Oh, you lucky guy.

61
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,780
Oh, can they be kinda
strong too? Is that cool?

62
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,690
Thank you, man.

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,400
Oh, whoa. Maybe
not that strong.

64
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,820
Katrina!

65
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,230
Katrina!

66
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,170
Katrina?

67
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,950
Katrina!

68
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,080
Mitch!

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,990
Mitch!

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,920
Mitch!

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,020
Mitch!

72
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,760
Katrina!

73
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,520
How are you tonight my brother?

74
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,540
I am ready to go on vacation.

75
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:58,278
Click encrypted link,
then download file.

76
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,900
We're gonna fucking set
your shit on fire, man!

77
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,000
Fuckin' burn,
motherfucker, burn!

78
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,810
To our brothers
across the globe...

79
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,210
Come join our fight against
American imperialism.

80
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,080
They will pay for the
murder of our families,

81
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,080
our friends, and all children.

82
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,450
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

83
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,320
What is in your heart brother?

84
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,090
I want to bathe my hands in
the blood of the infidels.

85
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,590
We are logging your
keystrokes. Answer quickly.

86
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,810
Who was taken in the
Year of Sorrow?

87
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,810
Khadijah and Abu Talib.

88
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,900
Who was with the Prophet
for the Isra and Mi'raj?

89
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,910
The Angel Gabriel.

90
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,010
All right, stop! Come on, man!

91
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

92
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,460
Let him go, let him go.
Let him go, let him go!

93
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,120
Break it up. Let him go!

94
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,290
What the fuck is your deal, man?

95
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,920
That's it. You're
done, Rapp. Get out.

96
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,520
He keeps doing this shit.

97
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Get out!

98
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Have a nice fucking day.

99
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,330
You were out of line.

100
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,300
Back to work. Keep moving.

101
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,710
Get outta there!

102
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,090
You're gonna get yourself
killed, you dumbass!

103
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
What's up with this guy?

104
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,660
Fuck!

105
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,180
Rapp, why I gotta
tell you again?

106
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,300
Sorry, Mr. Nazir. I didn't
realize it was past 10:00.

107
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,490
I'll try to keep it down.

108
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,020
Yeah, enough with the sports.

109
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,220
Copy that. All right.
Thanks, Mr. Nazir.

110
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,980
He's up again.

111
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,260
Will you come here?

112
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,360
Allah wills that I join the
struggle wherever I am called.

113
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,790
Assalam-alaikum.

114
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,090
Walaikum-assalam.

115
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,940
If it were up to me, I
would not have chosen you.

116
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,810
But others have
decided differently.

117
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,030
Whomsoever Allah guides
there is none to misguide.

118
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,420
What is the name of the sister of
the Prophet, peace be upon him.

119
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,300
Huzafa bint Al-Haarith.

120
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,640
Wrong.

121
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,769
She was not the
Prophet's sister.

122
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,020
She is honored as the sister of
the Prophet, peace be upon him...

123
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,470
...because both suckled from her
blood mother, Halimah al-Sa'diyah.

124
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,350
Why have you come?

125
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,200
To help Adnan al-Mansur
achieve his people's destiny.

126
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,930
Inshallah.

127
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,970
I wanted to look in your eyes.

128
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,470
I don't trust you.

129
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,210
I'm prepared to die a martyr.

130
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,970
What can I do to
earn your trust?

131
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,880
No!

132
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,990
Step away, now!

133
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,290
Come on!

134
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,520
The fuck off me!

135
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,830
He's dead, it's over.

136
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,960
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.

137
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,570
Area's secure.

138
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,070
You wanted to kill them all,
and then go on killing.

139
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,440
Pretty extreme, don't you think?

140
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,910
No, I don't think
that's extreme at all.

141
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,650
I think people like
that deserve to die

142
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,780
in the worst ways
you can imagine.

143
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,850
What do you remember about
your parents' death?

144
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,950
Car crash.

145
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,390
I was in Massachusetts.

146
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,920
They were in Tunisia
at the time.

147
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,450
I was 14.

148
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,860
That's what I remember.

149
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,090
You started having
discipline problems.

150
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,390
Got yourself kicked out of
three boarding schools.

151
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,330
Yeah, yeah. I know. I
wonder what that was about.

152
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,600
Let's talk about what happened
after that day on the beach.

153
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,570
Oh, Jesus Christ. Again?
Are you kidding me?

154
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,640
Yeah, again.

155
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,710
You gave up everything
after that, didn't you?

156
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,880
Your grad studies at
Brown University.

157
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,320
I must have lost interest.

158
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,720
In everything?

159
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,520
No, not everything.

160
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,400
See you later, Dr. Frain.

161
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,700
See you tomorrow, same time?

162
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,740
I like the new look.

163
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,010
Irene Kennedy, CIA
Deputy Director

164
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,510
in charge of Counterterrorism.

165
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,980
I know who you are.

166
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,750
Any idea how long you been here?

167
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,150
30 days.

168
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,860
Enough time for you to
figure out a couple things.

169
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,430
Yeah, yeah. I've figured
out a lot about myself.

170
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,500
It's been a very reflective
time. Thank you.

171
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,930
You wouldn't have made it through
the next 20 seconds there alive.

172
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,640
I guess we'll never
know now, will we?

173
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,040
You told Dr. Frain you thought
you were gonna kill Mansur

174
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,740
and wipe out his whole cell.

175
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,970
For starters.

176
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,780
Mmm-hmm.

177
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,440
You had an even bigger
agenda, didn't you, Mitch?

178
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,450
What did you think,

179
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,950
you were gonna jump from cell
to cell taking out terrorists?

180
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,420
Righting the world's wrongs?

181
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,080
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

182
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,520
I mean, it's more than
you accomplished.

183
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,660
I'm gonna let you
in on something.

184
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,520
Our people here, they don't
know what to do with you.

185
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,960
A lot of them think we should
just throw you in a supermax.

186
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,830
Me?

187
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,000
I like your agenda, Mitch.

188
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,700
I can help you with it,
if you throw in with us.

189
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,670
We can teach you how to
play with the big boys.

190
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,540
Yeah, let me stop
you right there.

191
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,170
You don't think I considered
that 18 months ago?

192
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,840
Joining the CIA?

193
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,640
I made the decision to
pursue Mansur on my own

194
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,750
'cause I knew I
could get it done.

195
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,920
What you need to understand
is that I'm the only way.

196
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,620
To get what you want.

197
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,990
Why the hell would I trust you?

198
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,830
Because I believe in you.

199
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,560
And I'm all you've got.

200
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,700
What's been confirmed is

201
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,240
the enriched plutonium
has been stolen

202
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,170
from a decommissioned
Russian nuclear facility.

203
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,240
If they get their hands
on a nuclear trigger

204
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,040
and a physicist to build it,

205
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,610
they'd be able to arm it and
detonate it at any time.

206
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,110
Tom?

207
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,150
He's testing through the roof.

208
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,250
Might be the best
I've ever seen.

209
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,590
We've had him under
surveillance for six months.

210
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,090
Martial arts, gun skills.

211
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,130
I've surveilled dozens
of these vigilantes.

212
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,530
This one is different.

213
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,260
Yeah, well, I've gone
over these, Irene.

214
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,600
He's noncompliant,
he's oppositional.

215
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,600
He got us into Mansur's cell.

216
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,600
That's a hell of a lot
more than we ever managed.

217
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
All right, Orion is
an elite unit, Irene.

218
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,240
A secret unit.

219
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,880
Reports to you, me,
and no one else.

220
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,050
I don't want to be responsible

221
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,510
for that kind of mistake.

222
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,980
Now, that's Hurley talking.

223
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,950
Yeah, well, he's called
me twice about this.

224
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,920
This kind of psych profile
scares the hell out of him.

225
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,750
As far as he's concerned,

226
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,760
you're sending him a Section
8 with an ax to grind.

227
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,620
What happened to that
kid on the beach,

228
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,990
it changed him.

229
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,830
You can't train
that into someone.

230
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,690
His psych profile is exactly
what I've been looking for.

231
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,300
Polygraph?

232
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,570
Flying colors.

233
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,870
All right. Good
luck with Hurley.

234
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,870
Oh, Irene.

235
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,740
We'll have fresh
intel on the Russian

236
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,580
plutonium situation
in two hours.

237
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,040
Stay by your phone.

238
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Yeah.

239
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,560
You can take the blindfold off.

240
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,940
So, what do I need to
know about this guy?

241
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,100
Stan Hurley.

242
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,200
He's a warrior.

243
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,800
Ex-Navy SEAL.

244
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,940
My daddy served with him
in the Persian Gulf.

245
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,160
Did you go through this program?

246
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,160
I went through a
program. Not this one.

247
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,190
It's not like becoming
a spy or Special Ops,

248
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,560
none of those things.

249
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,200
Good.

250
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,920
So, what are your goals, Mitch?

251
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,690
My goals?

252
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,370
My goal is to have them
lie awake at night,

253
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,860
knowing I'm coming for them.

254
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,320
I thought you were supposed
to be on the patch.

255
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
You saw those tests.

256
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,430
Yeah, I saw them.

257
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,930
He's off the charts.

258
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,030
I've seen off the charts before.

259
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,700
And he's got none
of the bad habits

260
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,730
he'd have to unlearn if
he had military training.

261
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
Unlearn?

262
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,870
Come on, Stan.

263
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,750
You drop one of your Navy
SEALs in an urban setting,

264
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,010
you can spot the boot
camp on them a mile away.

265
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
We're not fighting the...

266
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,710
Cold War? Yeah, I know.

267
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,580
You keep telling me that,
Miss Deputy Director.

268
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,950
Oh, wow. "Miss
Deputy Director."

269
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,780
Your daddy would agree with me.

270
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,320
I'll be checking in with
you every 48 hours.

271
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,860
I'm on a plane to
London in the morning.

272
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,930
And go back on the
patch, for God's sake.

273
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,060
Don't prove me wrong.

274
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,370
She ain't coming back.

275
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,710
Hey.

276
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,980
Eyes front and center.

277
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,210
Sorry.

278
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,330
"Sorry"? Do I look like one
of your college professors?

279
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,250
You talk to me, you
call me "sir," son.

280
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,220
Yes, sir.

281
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,190
What the fuck you doing here?

282
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,100
Did you have some bad
things happen to you,

283
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,100
some shitty things
happen to you?

284
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,070
Now you wanna kill those
mean old terrorists.

285
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,200
Go get some bad guys.

286
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,080
What makes you think
you can make it

287
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,310
through my selection process?

288
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,010
Permission to speak, sir?

289
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
Sure, go ahead if you
got something to say.

290
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,810
Like this is all a big mistake
and you wanna go home.

291
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,280
You wanna go home? Good.

292
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,320
Get the fuck out of here.
I'll drive you myself.

293
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,210
Not at all, sir.

294
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,410
I was gonna suggest we maybe
speed this whole thing up?

295
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,330
My guess is, if you and
I go hand-to-hand,

296
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,130
you could probably figure
out inside of 20 seconds

297
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,460
whether or not I have
what it takes to make it

298
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,990
through your selection process.

299
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,260
So, what do you think?

300
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,500
We got an empty cot,
empty footlocker.

301
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,330
They're both yours as
long as you can last.

302
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,240
Sounds good.

303
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,010
Follow me.

304
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,270
See you out there.

305
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,550
Heard a lot about
you, by the way.

306
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,210
Excited to see what you got.

307
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
Kill me.

308
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,430
People think you can slice
a man's throat like this.

309
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,840
That's only in the movies.

310
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,300
Right there.

311
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Do it.

312
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,470
No noise. No mess.

313
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,820
Victor, you're up.

314
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,860
What the fuck, man?

315
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,830
Who grabs a fucking blade?

316
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,950
Come on, you fuckin'
pussy. Let's go!

317
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,020
You gotta have eyes in
the back of your head.

318
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,600
You flinch, you die.

319
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,370
Orion is about the mission.

320
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,540
It ain't about you.

321
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,210
You go down out there, you're
a ghost, you don't exist.

322
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,550
There's nobody, nobody
coming back for you.

323
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,620
You're about to be captured.

324
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,630
Bye-bye.

325
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,470
We now know 15 kilos
of plutonium-239

326
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,340
went missing during
the Russian breach.

327
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,410
It's enough to build a
full-scale nuclear weapon.

328
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,540
But that would likely require the
resources of a nation-state.

329
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,410
As Iranian Chief
of General Staff,

330
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,380
I share your concern.

331
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,350
We have been monitoring the
situation as you have.

332
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
I'm afraid we too
are in the dark.

333
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
For Iran, of course,

334
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,490
a nuclear weapon
is off the table.

335
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,120
We have a treaty.

336
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,490
You have countrymen who are
not too happy about that.

337
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,100
We monitor your nuclear enrichment
program pretty closely,

338
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,930
but black market
plutonium-239 from Russia...

339
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,670
Would be difficult for
inspectors to detect.

340
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,300
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

341
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,170
Mmm-hmm.

342
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,940
I assure you as
Minister of Defense

343
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,180
that we in Iran recognize how
much the spirit of comity

344
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,650
between our nations
would be compromised

345
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,550
if we were to acquire

346
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,720
weapons-grade plutonium
from any source.

347
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,320
Yes, it would.

348
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,990
Same goes for your
clients outside Iran,

349
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,560
Hezbollah. Hamas.

350
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,360
The Houthis.

351
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Nuclear weapons are a danger
in any hands, Director.

352
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,170
Wasn't that your pretext
for your invasion

353
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,740
of our neighbor to the west?

354
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,270
One that cost
500,000 Iraqi lives

355
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,640
and left a wake of destruction

356
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,570
from which our region
has never recovered.

357
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,080
General Rostami, we came only
to tell you what we know.

358
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,510
Is that a threat?

359
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,420
Of course not, Minister Behruz.

360
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,150
Gentlemen, I very much
appreciate you meeting with us.

361
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,620
Not at all.

362
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,090
I only wish we could
offer more insight.

363
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,130
Thank you.

364
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,610
I don't trust General Rostami.

365
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,380
We need to keep this quiet.

366
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,440
How ready is Orion?

367
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,380
I'll check in with Hurley.

368
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,780
Why is there no one on watch?

369
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,520
You're all dead.

370
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,760
Yeah, yeah. I got
it, I got it.

371
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,760
You're dead.

372
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,130
What?

373
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,100
You wanna say something to
me? Say it. Go on, say it.

374
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,440
You got 30 seconds!

375
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,180
These are your targets.

376
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,110
Memorize them.

377
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,650
It's your responsibility to
be able to identify them.

378
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,520
You shoot a combatant,
you get a point.

379
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,550
You miss, you get a shock.

380
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,520
You shoot a noncombatant,
you get a bigger shock.

381
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,060
Combatant shoots you...

382
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,560
Let's just say you're
gonna feel it.

383
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,590
Ready?

384
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,260
Go.

385
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,740
What's Hurley doing?

386
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,740
He's fucking with his head.

387
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,780
Fuck!

388
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,450
Fucking AR bullshit.

389
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,370
Shall we?

390
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,340
Okay.

391
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,840
That's clever.

392
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,410
Raw plutonium.

393
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,950
Highly enriched, as promised.

394
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,550
Let's hope.

395
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,160
Wow, that's a beautiful
sound, gentlemen.

396
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,290
May I?

397
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,870
Okay.

398
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
Wire the money.

399
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,930
That, I can do.

400
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,870
This is a cell phone.

401
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,250
Gotta move all the vans. The
Cardinal's visiting.

402
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,520
Okay.

403
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay. Five minutes.

404
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,290
What's going on in there?

405
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Souvenirs.

406
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,760
Possible code red,
backup needed.

407
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,010
There's nothing going on.

408
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,390
Come in.

409
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,780
It now appears that
all seven victims

410
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,430
were shot with a single weapon,

411
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,400
believed to be a Glock 29.

412
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,900
Traces of weaponized plutonium

413
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,470
were detected inside the van

414
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,040
where the bodies
of three Russians

415
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,510
and two Warsaw police
officers were found.

416
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
The Russian government
has confirmed

417
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,380
that the chemical footprint
of the plutonium in question

418
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,380
is a match to the
plutonium that was stolen

419
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,650
from the decommissioned

420
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,780
processing facility in Tobolsk.

421
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,790
Security footage is being
analyzed by Polish police,

422
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,960
now working in conjunction
with Interpol,

423
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,020
to identify the shooter
and his connection

424
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,730
to the missing plutonium.

425
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,790
The identity of the shooter
remains unknown...

426
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,830
Hi, excuse me.

427
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,330
- How can I help you?
- Question.

428
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,800
May I help you?

429
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,970
No, thanks. I'm okay.

430
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,890
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

431
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,400
Rapp! God damn it!

432
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,510
You have to stay under control.

433
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,730
Dickhead!

434
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,400
Asshole doesn't
know when to quit.

435
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,400
You're kidding me, right?
I just saved your ass.

436
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,680
You've gotta know when the
mission's been accomplished, Rapp.

437
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,180
- Sir, he's a fucking...
- Which he did.

438
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,510
Never assume your target
is the only target.

439
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,520
The enemy dresses like a deer
and he kills like a lion.

440
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,710
And that's what we gotta do.

441
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,150
We just gotta do it better.

442
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,780
All right.

443
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,420
You're an asshole.

444
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,000
We got a problem.

445
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,570
Six weeks ago,
there was a breach

446
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,770
at a decommissioned Russian
plutonium facility.

447
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,910
I'm aware.

448
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,540
What you don't know is 15 kilos
of plutonium went missing.

449
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,010
Weapons-grade.

450
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,950
That's a shit-ton
of plutonium.

451
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,180
And it just changed hands.

452
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,190
I wanna show you something.

453
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,460
Take a look at this.

454
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,890
Does that face bong
a gong for you?

455
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,460
Or is it just me?

456
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,230
It can't be him.

457
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,770
Our drones took him out after
the embassy bombing at Bamako.

458
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,670
We never got a positive ID.

459
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,710
That's our mad dog out there.

460
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,980
All right. Let's say it's him.

461
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,710
It's him, Irene.

462
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,080
This gives us a chance to kill
two birds with one stone.

463
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,590
Hamdi Sharif.

464
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,120
He's an arms dealer
working out of Turkey.

465
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,990
Four days ago, he purchased a
Russian-designed nuclear trigger.

466
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,960
And he's gonna be selling it.

467
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,590
Sharif's got the honey.

468
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,830
Now we just wait for the bee.

469
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,030
We go in, we fuck up their deal.

470
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,200
And we take 'em both out.

471
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,540
You're going to Istanbul.

472
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,740
We have an agent in place.

473
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,920
She'll meet you at the airport.

474
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,680
All right.

475
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,010
Annika Ogden. We've had her
on the ground over there

476
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,150
for five years.

477
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,620
I want Rapp on the team.

478
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,890
Really?

479
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,090
He's ready, Stan.

480
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,520
Actually, Irene, he's not ready.

481
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,860
But he will be.

482
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,870
You wanted to see me, sir?

483
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Yeah. Shut the door.

484
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,540
We're shipping out.

485
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,770
Set those down there.

486
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,180
You like movies?

487
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Sure.

488
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,920
I got something for you.

489
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,050
What the fuck is this?

490
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,780
Yeah, I thought so.

491
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,970
You thought so?

492
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,120
Yeah.

493
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,190
Why are you even alive, Rapp?

494
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,830
You ever asked yourself that?

495
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:36,060
Why you? You know,
of all those people?

496
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,760
You're special, I guess.

497
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,960
Oh, my God!

498
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,330
You want me to turn it up?

499
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,300
- I'll marry you!
- Take it!

500
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,340
You're a fucking coward, you
know that? Turn that shit off.

501
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,340
What do you think?
It's my mom's ring.

502
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,980
You gonna turn it off?

503
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,310
Katrina!

504
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,020
Am I supposed to
feel sorry for you?

505
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,950
I don't.

506
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,830
You made a big mistake.

507
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,970
You let emotion cloud
your judgment.

508
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,340
Never, ever let it get personal.

509
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,810
You understand?

510
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,620
Yeah, I got it.

511
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,090
Be ready to go by 5:00.

512
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,360
See you at 4:30.

513
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,630
You know what you're
gonna do here?

514
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,680
No, sir.

515
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,700
Correct. You don't.

516
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,210
So keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

517
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,270
And wait for my orders.

518
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:34,300
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate
mogul/arms dealer.

519
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,640
He's like Santa Claus
for terrorists.

520
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,010
Scumbag.

521
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,910
Spare me your
junior-year-abroad

522
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,680
moral opinion, would you, Rapp?

523
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,010
Not really an opinion, sir.
Sharif's a piece of shit.

524
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,410
It's not a crusade.

525
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,450
This mission is practical.
Don't make it...

526
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,780
Personal?

527
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,970
Exactly.

528
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,120
Yes, sir.

529
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,920
Victor, you're with me.

530
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,020
Rapp, you and
Annika are eyes on.

531
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,290
Sharif has a routine.

532
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,940
Let's see if anything
breaks his pattern.

533
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,900
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

534
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,930
All right, we got 48 hours.

535
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,300
Quick, clean. No footprint.

536
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,230
This town's ready
to blow as it is.

537
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,040
Where the hell are you going?

538
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,620
Excuse me.

539
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,130
That was fucking reckless, Rapp.

540
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,830
I took the initiative, sir.

541
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,510
- He could've been made.
- Well, I wasn't.

542
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,340
Here we go.

543
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,940
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

544
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,110
A meeting at a restaurant
on Akbiyik Street.

545
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,010
That's right before Sharif
goes to see his mistress.

546
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,480
That breaks his pattern.

547
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,060
I'll tell you what'll
break his pattern.

548
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,520
When that fucking
assistant tells his boss

549
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,950
he lost his goddamn phone.

550
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,220
He won't.

551
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,020
He's too afraid of Sharif to
let him know he screwed up.

552
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:46,020
All right. We go tomorrow.

553
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,320
What's the mission, sir?

554
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,130
Eliminate the target.
Eliminate the recipient.

555
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,290
Obtain the package.

556
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,030
And what's the package?

557
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,220
We'll know it when we see it.

558
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,460
You're lead.

559
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,770
You're backup.

560
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,770
We will watch from
across the street.

561
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,680
We get to play lovers.

562
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,920
How long have you been married?

563
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,360
He thinks we're married.

564
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,270
Don't think too much.

565
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,940
You'll lose your nerve.

566
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,180
No, I don't think so.

567
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,580
It'll be your first time.

568
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,250
Yeah, not in my mind.

569
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,100
Lead, your friend's
arriving now.

570
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,200
Copy.

571
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,520
And he brought a shitload
of military protection.

572
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,960
I'll take care of the MPs.

573
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,030
Oh, come on, now,
honey. Don't be mad.

574
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,930
No, no, no.

575
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,400
I had a few. Yeah, I did.

576
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,950
I'll make it up to
you when I get home.

577
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,270
You know that.

578
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:05,060
Car bombing, near
Beylerbeyi Palace.

579
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,590
Call it in. Call it in, or
I'll cut your fucking throat.

580
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,310
Lead, you're a go.

581
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,010
Survey 2, get in place.

582
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,370
- Be careful in there.
- I got it.

583
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,290
Pardon.

584
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,390
The nuclear trigger
is in the sedan.

585
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,170
Target's gone. Target's gone.

586
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,570
Get back!

587
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,200
Lead?

588
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,040
Dead.

589
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,240
Mission terminated.

590
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,280
Exfil to secure
location. Confirm.

591
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:30,680
Survey 2, you better let me
hear you fucking confirm.

592
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,750
God damn it, this is a fucking
mess. We're out of here.

593
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,300
Drive! Drive!

594
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,140
Follow your boss!

595
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,270
Please, I'm just the assistant!

596
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,810
Don't hurt me!

597
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,610
Drive! Drive!

598
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,020
He's there right now
on the fifth floor.

599
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,650
Please I don't approve
of what Sharif does.

600
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,120
Don't kill me.

601
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,220
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

602
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,220
I'm gonna hurt your boss.

603
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,840
The American mercenary
has the nuclear trigger.

604
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,370
I've done my job. It's
your problem now.

605
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,730
Shit.

606
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,140
Hurry up!

607
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,480
Come on, come on, come on.

608
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:36,690
Come on.

609
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,430
No, please.

610
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,670
Please, don't. Don't.

611
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:40,570
No.

612
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,190
You disobeyed a direct order.

613
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,840
No, I made a decision
to pursue the target,

614
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,470
and I completed the mission.

615
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,410
And, sir, isn't that what I'm
here to do? Isn't that my job?

616
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,380
Your fucking job is to do what
I fucking tell you to do!

617
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,820
What, you prefer I
leave him alive, then,

618
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,450
let him go? That
piece of shit?

619
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,730
Stan?

620
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,970
Good, you're here. I wanna
show you something.

621
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Wait here.

622
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,460
Look at that. That's
the kind of bullshit

623
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,760
that could shut us down.

624
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,870
Kid can't even follow
a fucking order.

625
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,180
Victor got made. Rapp didn't.

626
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,510
Why does this kid give you
such a fucking hard-on?

627
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,510
Don't talk to me like
that! I'm your superior.

628
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,610
My superior, Irene?

629
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:35,050
Your superior, God damn it.

630
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,650
Do you have any idea how
long I spent looking

631
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,550
for someone with that
kid's talent and balls?

632
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,660
Rapp stays.

633
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,160
You're giving me an order?

634
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,420
That's an affirmative.

635
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,590
Can you give us a minute?

636
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,800
Look at this.

637
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,570
The trigger must have
been in that car.

638
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,670
Look at him.

639
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,010
Lookin' at me.

640
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,080
Everything he did there,

641
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,580
I taught him how to do it.

642
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,210
Stan.

643
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,720
I should've left
him in the Navy.

644
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,830
I'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch.

645
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,990
Stan, listen to me.

646
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,520
The only thing that matters now

647
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,000
is that fucking lunatic
has everything he needs

648
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,090
to build a nuclear weapon.

649
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:25,960
He's got a trigger. Now he
needs to buy a physicist.

650
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,500
We just have to figure out

651
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,100
where they're gonna
build this thing.

652
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,870
Ben.

653
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,840
That computer our boy Rapp
lifted from Sharif's house,

654
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:38,110
there's evidence of a $2 million
transfer to a bank account in Rome.

655
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,870
Cash prepped for withdrawal.

656
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:40,970
Rome.

657
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,120
Your money.

658
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,690
I've been reading up, Minister.

659
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,860
You Iranians probably all
learn this growing up,

660
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,990
or at least you did before
you signed that treaty.

661
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,530
But me, I had no idea
about these fun facts.

662
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,260
Yeah, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

663
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,870
Inside three miles,
apparently you just vaporize.

664
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,070
Some folks don't.

665
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,070
They get all black and charred,

666
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:37,580
and dense as lead, and
no one knows why.

667
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:41,010
Inside five miles, everything
is sucked into a void,

668
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,250
hotter than the core of the sun.

669
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,790
How about that?

670
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,150
Where's the rest?

671
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,860
You'll get the rest of your
money when the job's done.

672
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,170
Where is my physicist?

673
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,830
He'll pick up his money,
then we'll pick him up.

674
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,860
He's staying at a hotel in Rome.

675
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,970
We'll need an extra day to configure
the weapon, then it's all yours.

676
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,170
Kill as many Jews as you want.

677
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,180
Do you practice Salah, brother?

678
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,750
I receive my payment,
complete the project.

679
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,290
That's my practice, brother.

680
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,590
Very well.

681
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,780
Who was that guy?

682
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,820
In Istanbul.

683
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,860
It seemed like he was
a step ahead of us.

684
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,930
Hey, you gonna fill
me in here or what?

685
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,010
There's some bad people planning
on doing some bad things,

686
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,230
and it's our job to stop them.

687
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,070
You still haven't said
anything about Victor.

688
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,770
Victor's gone. Victor
doesn't exist.

689
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,850
What is it you think
we do here, Rapp?

690
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,050
I think we kill people
who need to be killed.

691
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,100
And who do you
trust to tell you?

692
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,450
I follow orders.

693
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,290
No, you follow orders
when they suit you.

694
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,820
This whole thing is pretty much

695
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,790
just a means to an end
for you, isn't it?

696
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:45,230
A lot's happened
in my life, sir.

697
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,260
Really? Huh.

698
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,260
Yeah.

699
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,760
So you think you were sent here

700
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,070
as an outlet for
your self-pity,

701
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,200
and your anger, and all
your guilt. Right?

702
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,740
Patriotism exists

703
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:01,810
because people like you and people
like me need a higher cause.

704
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,140
Something bigger than us.

705
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,950
That stink coming outta you

706
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,880
you like to call "revenge,"
the rest of us call "shit."

707
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,430
And as soon as it
starts to feel good,

708
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,250
that's when you stop
being a professional.

709
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,720
And then what are you?

710
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,960
Tell us something good, darling.

711
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:23,860
We're in their system.

712
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,970
The moment that transfer from
Sharif's account is picked up,

713
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,940
we'll know it.

714
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,870
Boy, you just smile,
and the Red Sea parts.

715
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,240
Works in the Med, too.

716
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,510
I'll bet it does.

717
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,990
Cash withdrawal from Sharif's
account. $2 million, U.S.

718
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,530
There's our
physicist. Let's go.

719
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,540
Welcome to the Boscolo
and enjoy your stay.

720
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,280
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

721
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,990
He's in 1448.

722
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,820
And we're next door.

723
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,410
Code in.

724
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:16,920
Victor-Charlie 1109.

725
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,520
Confirmed.

726
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,920
Suite 1448. We're in
1449, right next door.

727
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:24,020
All right. We'll
grab the physicist,

728
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,220
and we'll take out
whosever coming for him.

729
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,890
Signal every 15 minutes.

730
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,530
Hey.

731
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,080
I know what happened to you.

732
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,610
I'm sorry.

733
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,290
I understand you.

734
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,020
More than you know.

735
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,270
I know what it's like to
lose people you love.

736
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,640
We're gonna get these fuckers.

737
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,350
Fuck!

738
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,990
Where the hell are you?

739
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,410
Hurley... Where is he?

740
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:45,280
I don't know what
you're talking...

741
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,670
Where is he?

742
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,570
He outside?

743
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,510
Please, no.

744
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:57,350
Please.

745
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,720
Hurley, what the fuck?

746
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,200
I thought you were eyes on,
why didn't you spot 'em?

747
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,490
They were already
in the damn hotel.

748
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,120
Local mafia's working with 'em.

749
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,530
I'll tell Kennedy we
have the physicist.

750
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:25,240
What the hell just
happened out there, huh?

751
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:27,310
That's twice now this guy's
blown up our entire op.

752
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,710
What's the target? Huh?
What's the target?

753
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,380
- I don't know, mister.
- Yeah, you do.

754
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,680
Huh?

755
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,150
Do you think I'm stupid?

756
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,490
He's an American.
He said your name.

757
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,880
Did you train this guy?

758
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,640
You like to smoke?

759
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,350
Oh, Jesus Christ!

760
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,220
- Are you a smoker?
- I don't...

761
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,650
- Wait!
- Bad habit.

762
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:47,390
Wait, stop! Wait, wait!
I know something.

763
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:48,870
- What do you know?
- I know something.

764
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,560
There is a man... There
is a man they call Ghost.

765
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,500
Ghost. I think it was
an Iranian man said it.

766
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:57,910
- Uh-huh. Where are they building the bomb?
- I just...

767
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,380
- Where are they building it?
- Took the money.

768
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,170
Where are they building it?

769
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,170
All right, here. Take some
time to think about it.

770
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,480
Ghost. Is that his name?

771
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,180
Why is this guy after you?

772
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,780
Something personal, sir?

773
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,550
They're building a nuke.

774
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:18,590
Hotel Navona.

775
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,420
- Clean yourself up.
- Wait.

776
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,520
Don't go.

777
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,660
America's president has
ordered the Sixth Fleet

778
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,930
out of the U.S. Naval
base in Naples, Italy.

779
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,560
The Sixth Fleet is now
southwest off the coast...

780
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,170
Let me help you.

781
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,400
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

782
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:35,670
You're not.

783
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,650
How are you holding up?

784
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,760
I was afraid today.

785
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,630
I thought we were going to die.

786
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,900
Yeah, I'm either always
afraid or never afraid.

787
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,570
I don't know which.

788
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,220
There you go.

789
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,490
Just relax now.

790
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,290
We'll search for Ghost tomorrow.

791
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,810
You scared me.

792
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,740
Who are you?

793
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,350
What do you mean?

794
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:04,350
You said "Ghost."

795
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,570
What about him?

796
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,750
I never told you that name.

797
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:07,990
Hurley did.

798
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:09,920
Yeah, I think you're
full of shit.

799
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,620
- Mitch.
- Who are you?

800
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,670
- Mitch, what's wrong with you?
- Who do you work for?

801
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:15,330
I'm CIA.

802
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,330
Now don't fucking lie to me!

803
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,690
I'm not lying!

804
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:22,030
You're Iranian, aren't you?

805
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,530
Get the fuck away from me!

806
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,540
Are you working
with the Iranians?

807
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,610
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth!

808
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,840
Go to hell!

809
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,860
You Iranian intelligence?

810
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:55,960
Are you Iranian intelligence?

811
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:06,540
What do you know about Ghost?

812
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,320
We're gonna need the
decryption device.

813
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,830
You were right, Mitch.

814
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,470
This Iranian mole is a
tough nut to crack.

815
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,900
All I could get from her was
her handler. Azad Ashani.

816
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,050
Happens to be a friend of mine.

817
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:43,440
I'm gonna go pay him a visit.

818
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,660
Okay, I'm going with you.

819
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,840
No.

820
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,470
I need you to stay here.

821
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,040
Kennedy's on her way
with the CIA team

822
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,480
and a Mossad team.

823
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,750
She's gonna ask me
where you went.

824
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,410
What the hell am I
supposed to say?

825
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,720
That's right, she is. And
you're gonna be smart,

826
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,760
and you're gonna keep
your mouth shut,

827
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,450
and you're gonna cover my ass.

828
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,540
I still have it.

829
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:27,910
Very nice.

830
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:32,580
I am always happy to
meet you, Stan...

831
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,520
But never happy why.

832
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,090
Well, maybe next time
we'll meet for pizza.

833
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,390
Your girl's tough, by the way.

834
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,030
Go easy on her.

835
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,360
She's my niece.

836
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,930
Yeah.

837
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,840
What have you got for me?

838
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:03,110
The men behind all this
are General Rostami,

839
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,710
our military chief of staff,

840
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:08,610
and our defense
minister, Behruz.

841
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,820
Both are very powerful,

842
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:14,990
and both are very angry about the
nuclear treaty we made with you.

843
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,890
They have been trying to acquire

844
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,790
nuclear materials for
the past two years.

845
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,530
And they are the ones

846
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,990
who hired the mercenary
called Ghost.

847
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:29,970
Rostami is now in Tehran,
but Behruz is here in Rome.

848
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,940
Annika has been tracking his
movements through his cell phone.

849
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,110
And they're building it here?

850
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,840
I wish I knew.

851
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,610
We have their physicist.

852
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,580
They can't build it without him.

853
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:42,680
But...

854
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,780
The mercenary asked Behruz

855
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,650
to use one of ours, an Iranian.

856
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,450
Behruz agreed. That was rash.

857
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:55,190
It means they are in a hurry.

858
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,990
And the target's Israel?

859
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,160
I wish I had better
information for you.

860
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:11,840
Where the hell is Hurley?

861
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,700
You gotta tell me what's
going on here. Now.

862
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,710
That guy he trained,
who the hell is he?

863
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,590
That's not something you
need to know right now.

864
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,640
What are you covering up?

865
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,680
When you've got a level-5
security clearance

866
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:23,160
and 20 years'
experience, talk to me.

867
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:25,080
Until then, shut up
and do your job.

868
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:33,190
I want her cell phone
decrypted and scanned.

869
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:35,030
Local PD pulled a body from
the harbor an hour ago.

870
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:36,590
Gunshot to the chest.

871
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:38,730
Iranian intelligence
officer, Azad Ashani.

872
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,000
Christ!

873
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:43,030
That's the guy
Hurley went to meet.

874
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,800
Stupid son of a bitch!

875
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,580
All right, so what do we
do? We gotta go after him.

876
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,800
There's a fucking
nuke in play, Rapp.

877
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,110
That's the mission,
and the only mission.

878
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,880
This is now a joint
CIA-Mossad operation,

879
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,180
whether we like it or not.

880
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,720
Can you get the
Director on the phone?

881
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,810
So you're just gonna
write him off then?

882
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,680
That's the plan?

883
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:02,880
Stan Hurley is the closest
thing to family I've got.

884
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,060
And if he were standing
here right now,

885
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,720
his only question would be,

886
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,630
why are we wasting our
breath talking about him?

887
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,260
You're through here.

888
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,820
You're going home,
that's an order.

889
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:15,230
Now, sit down and shut up.

890
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,910
Why are you helping me?

891
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,880
Your handler Ashani was killed.

892
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:12,740
Hurley was with him.
Something happened.

893
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,780
I'm going after him.

894
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,850
I need your help.

895
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:20,990
We gotta go.

896
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,910
Stan.

897
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,980
I've looked forward to this.

898
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,910
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

899
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,990
I wanna show you something.

900
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,050
All right.

901
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,630
Savages. Right, Stan?

902
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:16,040
But you know something?
I don't blame them.

903
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,400
I blame you.

904
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,970
Never would've happened

905
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,180
if you would have
followed orders, Ronnie.

906
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,210
"You go down out there,
you're a ghost."

907
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,740
"You're a John Doe."

908
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,210
"You get captured?"

909
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,380
Oh, you remember.
That's very gratifying.

910
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,410
Thank you.

911
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,120
You made me proud today, Ron.

912
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:36,190
You should've come for me.

913
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,160
Ten men would've died.

914
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,720
You put 10 men's
lives in danger,

915
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,760
'cause you couldn't
follow a fucking order.

916
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,060
- Fuck you.
- Fuck orders.

917
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:45,800
- Fuck the mission!
- Fuck you.

918
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:48,160
This was me. I was your
boy, I believe that.

919
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,300
You made me believe that.

920
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,850
Ashani had their people
tracking Minister Behruz's

921
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
secure cell phone.

922
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:06,110
So, we find Behruz,
we find Hurley.

923
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,220
Mitch!

924
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,400
Oh, yeah, look at that.

925
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,100
Did you learn that in Aleppo?

926
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:10,440
No.

927
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,710
You always told us
what to expect, Stan.

928
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:20,850
Now, where's the
rest of your team?

929
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,880
Come on, Ronnie, really?

930
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,760
Don't call me that. Where's
the rest of your team?

931
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:27,950
Your new boy out
there, he on my tail?

932
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:31,420
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
There's your first mistake.

933
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,430
You never start with
a real question.

934
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,760
You start slow.

935
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,260
You get inside your
subject's head.

936
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:42,200
Stan, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

937
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,070
There's your second
mistake. Number two.

938
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,540
You don't say, "one more
time." You already...

939
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,770
Damn!

940
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:56,010
Now, what's that
third mistake, Stan?

941
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,980
Huh? What is it?

942
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,920
Go ahead! Go ahead!

943
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:02,420
I got nine more! I like this.

944
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,850
I like it. Go
ahead, bring it on!

945
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:05,960
You motherfucker!

946
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,290
Ronnie wants to know if
I got a team outside.

947
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,460
Right, Ron?

948
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,060
If it's safe to move your bomb.

949
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,000
Are we being followed?

950
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,230
Where's the new me?

951
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,840
I've done my research.
I know all about him.

952
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,340
"The new me..." Oh,
you mean Mitch?

953
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:29,040
You know, Mitch,
he's unpredictable.

954
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,310
You never know about Mitch.

955
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,910
He might be here,
he might be there.

956
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,520
He's like you, but
you're a real Section 8.

957
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,580
Enough.

958
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,780
Schizo mom.

959
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,950
Where are they?

960
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:38,450
- Loser dad.
- Where are they?

961
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,950
God!

962
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,860
Where's the rest of your team?

963
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,330
Half-wit mom, psycho dad...

964
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,560
Where's the rest of your team?

965
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,090
- You're pond scum.
- Where are they?

966
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,330
Pond scum! You're fucking...

967
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,370
I'm sorry about your handler.

968
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,980
Ashani was my uncle.

969
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,950
I'm sure it was Minister Behruz

970
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:14,850
and General Rostami
who had him killed.

971
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,550
They want nuclear
war with Israel.

972
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,420
We tried to stop them.

973
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,320
My brother and father
both died fighting them.

974
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,160
Corviale. Turn here.

975
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,000
You know what my
real mistake was?

976
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,300
I trusted you.

977
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,340
You made me feel like I
was the Second Coming.

978
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,140
And you acted like my father.

979
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:50,580
I trusted you and I trusted
the United States Navy.

980
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:02,560
U.S. of A. Does it, it's
gotta be good. Right, Stan?

981
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,630
Except

982
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:08,030
nobody told me the business
y'all are really in.

983
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,170
You create monsters.

984
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,500
That's just what you do.

985
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,270
Those people who did this to me,

986
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:20,470
you think they're barbarians?

987
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,380
Bullshit.

988
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,290
Where's the decryption
I asked for?

989
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,020
Rapp grabbed her smartphone
before we could get any of it.

990
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,190
And we can't find him.

991
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:39,030
Surveillance cameras
picked up Rapp

992
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,090
taking out our agents
five minutes ago.

993
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:46,200
What the hell are you doing?

994
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,370
There's not a single
thing happening here

995
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:57,610
that you didn't make happen.

996
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:03,180
God bless fucking
America, huh, Stan?

997
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:05,950
Hoorah!

998
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,990
Hoorah!

999
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:12,120
I can tell you where Mitch is...

1000
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:14,690
What's that third mistake, Stan?

1001
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,060
Mitch... I can't hear you.

1002
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,160
Fuck!

1003
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:28,340
Third mistake, never
get too close.

1004
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,300
Finish your personal
business here.

1005
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,010
Your work is done.

1006
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,440
The bomb is armed.

1007
01:22:33,470 --> 01:22:34,740
- Timer is set up?
- Yes.

1008
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:36,180
He's playing you.

1009
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:38,410
Bomb's not for
you, it's for him.

1010
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,010
It was his plan all along!

1011
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:13,440
Dead zone.

1012
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,740
We're not getting
any signals here.

1013
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,290
Come on. Come on.

1014
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,120
Wait a second.

1015
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,280
What are you gonna do with it?

1016
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:56,680
No, Stan.

1017
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,450
"What are we gonna
do with it?"

1018
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,720
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

1019
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,360
I like Rome.

1020
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:08,490
It's good food.

1021
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,630
Never, ever thought
I'd die in the field.

1022
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:20,070
Ain't it crazy?

1023
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,110
I always figured it
would be, I don't know,

1024
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,480
some cabin in the
woods with my dog.

1025
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:29,210
Me?

1026
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,480
I think I want water.

1027
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:34,620
There's just something
peaceful about dying at sea.

1028
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,620
All right.

1029
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,460
Let's get it over with.

1030
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:46,590
No, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1031
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,690
I ain't gonna kill you.

1032
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:50,100
You're gonna live to see

1033
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:52,100
the crown of your
creation, Stan.

1034
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,270
Thousands of Americans
are gonna burn.

1035
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:59,100
All because of you.

1036
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,240
Enjoy the show.

1037
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:05,340
Get ready.

1038
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,550
Go.

1039
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,750
Please help me.

1040
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,550
Annika.

1041
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,050
Your family were
very well respected.

1042
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:10,800
They were my friends.

1043
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,770
Bastard.

1044
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:18,060
I knew them very well.

1045
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:19,910
Please I beg you.

1046
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
Whoa!

1047
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:35,270
We've got an explosion detected.

1048
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:37,330
Here.

1049
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:39,430
A half click off the
Fiumicino waterways.

1050
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,840
It's underground.

1051
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:43,670
- Delta One, go!
- Let's go.

1052
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:45,440
Get a chopper out there.

1053
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,740
You're not supposed
to be here, Rapp.

1054
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:20,710
Yeah, what are you
gonna do, fire me?

1055
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:23,340
There's another passage down
there. He's got the nuke.

1056
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,440
You gonna be good?

1057
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,510
Go. Go!

1058
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,880
Put the gun down.

1059
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:08,650
Or she's dead.

1060
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,720
I want to see my family, Mitch.

1061
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,620
No, Annika, you don't.

1062
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,060
I want to see my family.

1063
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:20,160
Come on, Mitch. Be nice.

1064
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:21,830
She wants to live.

1065
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:23,760
She wants to see her family.

1066
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,460
Put the gun down.

1067
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:29,730
Annika!

1068
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,840
The bomb can't be stopped.

1069
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:30,540
Just like you couldn't stop

1070
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:32,880
that beautiful girl from
dying on the beach.

1071
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:38,780
Irene.

1072
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:41,820
The bomb's on a boat.

1073
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:43,150
Hurley?

1074
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,750
How do you know?

1075
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,990
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

1076
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,200
Is the Sixth Fleet
out on maneuvers?

1077
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:56,900
Oh, my God.

1078
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:58,230
Bring up ISR feeds.

1079
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,810
Get me eyes in the sky
over the coastline

1080
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,770
and put the Sixth Fleet
on nuclear alert.

1081
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,840
Tom.

1082
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,540
The target is the Sixth Fleet
and it's 25 miles offshore.

1083
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,320
It's a shame.

1084
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:20,860
The last thing your girl saw
was you not saving her.

1085
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:33,870
General quarters.

1086
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,800
All hands, man your stations.

1087
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:38,800
This is not a drill. I
repeat, this is not a drill.

1088
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,670
Inbound, small vessel-borne
nuclear device.

1089
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:43,110
Man decon stations.

1090
01:33:48,110 --> 01:33:50,680
Didn't Hurley teach you
anything, little brother?

1091
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,960
To never make it personal.

1092
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,370
This isn't personal.

1093
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:20,340
Shit.

1094
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,210
The bomb has a timer
and a release trigger.

1095
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,850
We take out his boat,
it'll detonate.

1096
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,850
If it goes off above
the waterline...

1097
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,750
Disaster. There'll be fallout
all over the mainland.

1098
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,160
USS Flynn... Prepare to engage.

1099
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,400
The boat is turning, sir.

1100
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,100
Who's driving that boat?

1101
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,640
Rapp.

1102
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:01,880
Go.

1103
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:03,810
- Sir?
- Go!

1104
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:14,020
What are you doing? Hurley.

1105
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:16,160
Hurley?

1106
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:17,700
Trying to get our boy to
throw the bomb in the water.

1107
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:20,290
Flynn, you are clear
to fire when ready.

1108
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:23,260
Do not fire, Commander.
The boat is turning.

1109
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,270
If we don't engage, that
guarantees detonation.

1110
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,430
I understand there's a risk,

1111
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,000
but this is the best
chance we've got.

1112
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,040
Shit! God damn it!

1113
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,910
There he is.

1114
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:43,010
Get me on that boat's
marine bandwidth.

1115
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:47,890
Rapp!

1116
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,160
Rapp!

1117
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:52,790
Can you hear me?
Pick up the radio!

1118
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:55,730
Throw the bomb overboard!

1119
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,930
No way, sir, I gotta get
further away from the fleet!

1120
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,330
Rapp!

1121
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,130
For once in your life,
take a goddamn order!

1122
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:04,030
The Sixth Fleet is about
to blow you to hell!

1123
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:18,850
Command, Delta Two, the
bomb's in the water.

1124
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,050
Commander, hold your fire!
The bomb's in the water.

1125
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,020
Flynn, hold fire!

1126
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:24,090
Hold fire!

1127
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,690
Hold fire!

1128
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:57,510
Got less than 30 seconds.

1129
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:02,550
All right, go! Get outta here!

1130
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:24,110
Jesus.

1131
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,310
Brace for impact.

1132
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,810
Sir, yes, sir!

1133
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,550
Holy shit.

1134
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,320
Hold on!

1135
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,530
Brace!

1136
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:53,440
You shouldn't have come for me.

1137
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:57,480
Don't get used to it, son.

1138
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:02,210
Hurley...

1139
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:04,550
Looks like we're gonna
be all right up here.

1140
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,380
I think.

1141
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:13,990
Damage control
central. Report.

1142
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:15,360
Pressure is normalizing.

1143
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:17,560
We have multiple hull breaches.

1144
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:19,400
Radiologicals, Eisenhower?

1145
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:21,260
Low... Low levels.

1146
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,970
Initiating countermeasure
wash-down.

1147
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,700
Commander, any casualties?

1148
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:28,670
The Flynn took some
serious damage.

1149
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,640
The casualty reports
aren't in yet,

1150
01:40:30,670 --> 01:40:33,680
but if it had gone off above the
waterline, I don't think we'd be here.

1151
01:40:33,710 --> 01:40:35,280
Eisenhower,

1152
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:38,450
my prayers are with you all.

1153
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,230
Hurley, is Rapp there?

1154
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,370
Hold on a minute.

1155
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:10,670
Yeah, go ahead.

1156
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:12,340
You okay, Mitch?

1157
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,110
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

1158
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,250
You saved a lot of lives today.

1159
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,590
Took some losses, too.

1160
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:31,410
What the hell are
you looking at?

1161
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:33,250
You look like a mummy.

1162
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,620
Yeah.

1163
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:36,680
Well...

1164
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,820
A mummy doesn't have
to write up reports.

1165
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:41,360
Dictate them. You
should be good at that.

1166
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,160
Iranian official,
General Rostami,

1167
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:47,160
the leader of the minority
opposition in Tehran,

1168
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,530
claims that he has proof
that a secret group

1169
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,800
of assassins within
America's CIA

1170
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:54,570
are responsible for last
week's nuclear event.

1171
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,440
With the Iranian
presidential election

1172
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,170
just two weeks away,

1173
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:01,540
General Rostami continues
to rise in popularity.

1174
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:03,180
They say General Rostami is

1175
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,850
gonna be the next
President of Iran.

1176
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,680
Yeah.

1177
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,560
He didn't even have to blow
up Israel to get there.

1178
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:10,550
He's gonna be a major
pain in the ass, too.

1179
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:13,150
Where's Rapp? I
can't reach him.

1180
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:14,820
How the hell do I
know where Rapp is?

1181
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:16,390
I'm a mummy in a hospital.

1182
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:18,690
Rostami has full support
for restarting.

1183
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,560
Iran's nuclear program.
