1
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:50,507
Here we are in beautiful Ibiza, Spain.

2
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,128
Beautiful sand.

3
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,506
Beautiful waves.

4
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,011
My favorite shorts.

5
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,060
And my favorite girl who is about to get...

6
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,181
Oh, my God!

7
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,013
Hey!

8
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,769
- Come on, give it to me.
- No! Stop! Come on!

9
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,144
- Mitch!
- This is great!

10
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,521
I'm serious.

11
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,024
Oh. Oh, my God. That is so cute.

12
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,901
Honey, this is like...

13
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,358
Let me film for just a couple minutes.

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,568
- It's like we're honeymooners.
- Oh, my God!

15
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,324
# Honeymooners #

16
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,406
- "Honeymoon"?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,990
We're not married.

18
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,541
Katrina Harper...

19
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,303
You're my best friend in the whole world.

20
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,345
Oh, my God. Babe, stop it.
You're gonna make me...

21
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,267
If you get emotional, you're gonna kill me.

22
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,436
I'm trying to get through this, babe.

23
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,640
I love you, more than anything.

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,859
Will you marry me?

25
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,237
Oh, my God!

26
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,906
- Yes!
- Yeah?

27
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,358
Yes, Mitch Rapp.

28
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,738
I'll marry you.

29
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,870
Sorry, it's hard one-handed.

30
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,000
You like it? It was my mom's ring.

31
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,754
I love it.

32
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,131
I love you.

33
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,266
- I'm still...
- Are you filming? Oh, my God!

34
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,810
Yeah, I'm still recording.
I'm trying to get this.

35
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,683
Come on, Mitch!

36
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,356
This is why I was filming now.
You see, now you get it.

37
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,478
Smile.

38
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,400
I'm gonna get drinks.

39
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,481
- Okay.
- Yeah?

40
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,565
Don't be too long.

41
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,867
I won't, I won't.

42
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,988
I love you.

43
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,069
I love you.

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,120
I'll be back.

45
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,415
Engagement drinks in the water, people.

46
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,546
Whoo-hoo!

47
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,841
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,044
Very sweet, thanks.
Babe, we're getting applause.

49
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,839
I love you.

50
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,174
Thank you.

51
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,442
Hola. Como estas?

52
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,693
What can I get you?

53
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,025
Um, can I just get two drinks, please?

54
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,156
Dos bebidas, if that's right...

55
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,782
Um, I just got engaged, so something special.

56
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,953
It can be anything, though.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,281
Oh, you lucky guy.

58
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,623
Oh, can they be kinda strong too?
Is that cool?

59
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,501
Thank you, man.

60
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,387
Oh, whoa. Maybe not that strong.

61
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,658
Katrina!

62
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,174
Katrina!

63
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,142
Katrina?

64
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,820
Katrina!

65
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,989
Mitch!

66
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,866
Mitch!

67
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,787
Mitch!

68
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,913
Mitch!

69
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,584
Katrina!

70
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,872
We're gonna fucking
set your shit on fire, man!

71
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,871
Fuckin' burn, motherfucker, burn!

72
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,452
To our brothers across the globe...

73
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:05,130
Come join our fight against
American imperialism.

74
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,799
They will pay for the murder of our families,

75
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:11,254
our friends, and all children.

76
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,395
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

77
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,706
All right, stop! Come on, man!

78
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

79
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,415
Let him go, let him go.
Let him go, let him go!

80
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,000
Break it up. Let him go!

81
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,215
What the fuck is your deal, man?

82
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,762
That's it. You're done, Rapp. Get out.

83
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,511
He keeps doing this shit.

84
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,590
Get out!

85
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,846
Have a nice fucking day.

86
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,272
You were out of line.

87
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,224
Back to work. Keep moving.

88
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,742
Get outta there!

89
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,818
You're gonna get yourself killed,
you dumb-ass!

90
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,903
What's up with this guy?

91
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,668
Fuck!

92
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,067
Rapp, why I gotta tell you again?

93
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,198
Sorry, Mr. Nazir.
I didn't realize it was past 10:00.

94
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,449
I'll try to keep it down.

95
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,872
Yeah, enough with the sports.

96
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,120
Copy that. All right. Thanks, Mr. Nazir.

97
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,810
He's up again.

98
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,554
Assalam-alaikum.

99
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,930
Walaikum-assalam.

100
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,294
Why have you come?

101
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,045
To help Adnan al-Mansur
achieve his people's destiny.

102
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,962
Inshallah.

103
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,013
I wanted to look in your eyes.

104
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,391
I don't trust you.

105
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,063
I'm prepared to die a martyr.

106
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,020
What can I do to earn your trust?

107
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,891
No!

108
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,025
Step away, now!

109
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,163
Come on!

110
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,456
The fuck off me!

111
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,660
He's dead, it's over.

112
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,996
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.

113
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,466
Area's secure.

114
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,135
You wanted to kill them all,
and then go on killing.

115
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,341
Pretty extreme, don't you think?

116
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,927
No, I don't think that's extreme at all.

117
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,603
I think people like that deserve to die

118
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,601
in the worst ways you can imagine.

119
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,899
What do you remember
about your parents' death?

120
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,977
Car crash.

121
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,277
I was in Massachusetts.

122
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,945
They were in Tunisia at the time.

123
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,364
I was 14.

124
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,737
That's what I remember.

125
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,160
You started having discipline problems.

126
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,283
Got yourself kicked out of
three boarding schools.

127
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,209
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I wonder what that was about.

128
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,538
Let's talk about what happened
after that day on the beach.

129
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,500
Oh, Jesus Christ. Again? Are you kidding me?

130
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,585
Yeah, again.

131
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,677
You gave up everything
after that, didn't you?

132
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,885
Your grad studies at Brown University.

133
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,686
- I must have lost interest.
- In everything?

134
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,440
No, not everything.

135
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,282
See you later, Dr. Frain.

136
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,660
See you tomorrow, same time?

137
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,705
I like the new look.

138
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,052
Irene Kennedy, CIA Deputy Director

139
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,423
in charge of Counter-terrorism.

140
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,006
I know who you are.

141
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,762
Any idea how long you been here?

142
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,182
30 days.

143
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,856
Enough time for you to figure out
a couple things.

144
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:51,310
Yeah, yeah. I've figured out
a lot about myself.

145
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,396
It's been a very reflective time. Thank you.

146
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,448
You wouldn't have made it through
the next 20 seconds there alive.

147
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,572
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

148
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,780
You told Dr. Frain you thought
you were gonna kill Mansur

149
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,705
and wipe out his whole cell.

150
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,999
For starters.

151
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,747
Mmm-hmm.

152
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,578
You had an even bigger agenda,
didn't you, Mitch?

153
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:14,963
What did you think, you were gonna jump
from cell to cell taking out terrorists?

154
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,293
Righting the world's wrongs?

155
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,128
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

156
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,430
I mean, it's more than you accomplished.

157
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,599
I'm gonna let you in on something.

158
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,428
Our people here, they don't know
what to do with you.

159
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,013
A lot of them think we should
just throw you in a supermax.

160
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,808
Me?

161
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,858
I like your agenda, Mitch.

162
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,358
I can help you with it,
if you throw in with us.

163
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,607
We can teach you how to play
with the big boys.

164
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,442
Yeah, let me stop you right there.

165
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,244
You don't think I considered
that 18 months ago?

166
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,823
Joining the CIA?

167
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,579
I made the decision to
pursue Mansur on my own

168
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,706
'cause I knew I could get it done.

169
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,915
What you need to understand
is that I'm the only way.

170
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,417
To get what you want.

171
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,377
Why the hell would I trust you?

172
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,804
Because I believe in you.

173
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,513
And I'm all you've got.

174
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,641
What's been confirmed is

175
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,314
the enriched plutonium has been stolen

176
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,234
from a decommissioned
Russian nuclear facility.

177
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,312
If they get their hands on a nuclear trigger

178
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,816
and a physicist to build it,

179
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,524
they'd be able to arm it
and detonate it at any time.

180
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,151
Tom?

181
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,208
He's testing through the roof.

182
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,335
Might be the best I've ever seen.

183
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,508
We've had him under surveillance
for six months.

184
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,880
Martial arts, gun skills.

185
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,178
I've surveilled dozens of these vigilantes.

186
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,426
This one is different.

187
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,349
Yeah, well, I've gone over these, Irene.

188
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,518
He's non-compliant, he's oppositional.

189
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,516
He got us into Mansur's cell.

190
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,518
That's a hell of a lot more
than we ever managed.

191
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,849
All right, Orion is an elite unit, Irene.

192
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,309
A secret unit.

193
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,861
Reports to you, me, and no one else.

194
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,063
I don't want to be responsible

195
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,237
for that kind of mistake.

196
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,065
Now, that's Hurley talking.

197
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,866
Yeah, well, he's called me twice about this.

198
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,912
This kind of psych profile
scares the hell out of him.

199
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,704
As far as he's concerned,

200
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,703
you're sending him a Section 8
with an ax to grind.

201
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,534
What happened to that kid on the beach,

202
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,994
it changed him.

203
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,579
You can't train that into someone.

204
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,541
His psych profile is exactly
what I've been looking for.

205
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,385
Polygraph?

206
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,552
Flying colors.

207
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,888
All right. Good luck with Hurley.

208
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,845
Oh, Irene.

209
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,680
We'll have fresh intel on the Russian

210
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,481
plutonium situation in two hours.

211
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,059
Stay by your phone.

212
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,143
Yeah.

213
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,455
You can take the blindfold off.

214
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,917
So, what do I need to know about this guy?

215
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,092
Stan Hurley.

216
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,262
He's a warrior.

217
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,758
Ex-Navy SEAL.

218
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,932
My daddy served with him in the Persian Gulf.

219
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,203
Did you go through this program?

220
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,201
I went through a program. Not this one.

221
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,248
It's not like becoming a spy or Special Ops,

222
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,451
none of those things.

223
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,244
Good.

224
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,940
So, what are your goals, Mitch?

225
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,610
My goals?

226
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,437
My goal is to have them lie awake at night,

227
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,898
knowing I'm coming for them.

228
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,396
I thought you were supposed
to be on the patch.

229
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,526
You saw those tests. Yeah, I saw them.

230
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,898
He's off the charts.

231
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,023
I've seen off the charts before.

232
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,608
And he's got none of the bad habits

233
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,659
he'd have to unlearn
if he had military training.

234
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,995
Unlearn?

235
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,868
Come on, Stan.

236
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,665
You drop one of your Navy SEALs
in an urban setting,

237
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,993
you can spot the boot camp
on them a mile away.

238
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,077
We're not fighting the...

239
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,628
Cold War? Yeah, I know.

240
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,251
You keep telling me that,
Miss Deputy Director.

241
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,918
Oh, wow. "Miss Deputy Director."

242
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,004
Your daddy would agree with me.

243
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,389
I'll be checking in with you every 48 hours.

244
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,477
I'm on a plane to London in the morning.

245
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,935
And go back on the patch, for God's sake.

246
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,818
Don't prove me wrong.

247
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,453
She ain't coming back.

248
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,621
Hey.

249
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,002
Eyes front and center.

250
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,247
Sorry.

251
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,378
"Sorry"? Do I look like one of
your college professors?

252
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,334
You talk to me, you call me "sir," son.

253
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,253
Yes, sir.

254
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,224
What the fuck you doing here?

255
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,101
Did you have some bad things happen to you,

256
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,103
some shitty things happen to you?

257
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,061
Now you wanna kill those mean old terrorists.

258
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,270
Go get some bad guys.

259
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,319
What makes you think you can make it
through my selection process?

260
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,991
Permission to speak, sir?

261
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,569
Sure, go ahead if you got something to say.

262
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:16,699
Like this is all a big mistake
and you wanna go home.

263
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,325
You wanna go home? Good.

264
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,405
Get the fuck out of here.
I'll drive you myself.

265
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,241
Not at all, sir.

266
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,371
I was gonna suggest we maybe
speed this whole thing up?

267
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,373
My guess is, if you and I go hand-to-hand,

268
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,126
you could probably figure out
inside of 20 seconds

269
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,966
whether or not I have what it takes to
make it through your selection process.

270
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,302
So, what do you think?

271
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,599
We got an empty cot, empty footlocker.

272
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,397
They're both yours as long as you can last.

273
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,268
Sounds good.

274
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,978
Follow me.

275
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,314
See you out there.

276
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,649
Heard a lot about you, by the way.

277
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,233
Excited to see what you got.

278
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,331
Kill me.

279
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,515
People think you can slice
a man's throat like this.

280
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,763
That's only in the movies.

281
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,345
Right there.

282
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,263
Do it.

283
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,348
No noise. No mess.

284
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,778
Victor, you're up.

285
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,790
What the fuck, man?

286
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,750
Who grabs a fucking blade?

287
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,903
Come on, you fuckin' pussy. Let's go!

288
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,742
You gotta have eyes in the back of your head.

289
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,708
You flinch, you die.

290
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,424
Orion is about the mission.

291
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,672
It ain't about you.

292
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:44,221
You go down out there, you're a ghost,
you don't exist.

293
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,645
There's nobody, nobody coming back for you.

294
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,732
You're about to be captured.

295
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,734
Bye-bye.

296
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:11,541
We now know 15 kilos of plutonium-239

297
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,246
went missing during the Russian breach.

298
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,458
It's enough to build
a full-scale nuclear weapon.

299
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,511
But that would likely require
the resources of a nation-state.

300
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,462
As Iranian Chief of General Staff,

301
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,423
I share your concern.

302
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:26,385
We have been monitoring
the situation as you have.

303
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,310
I'm afraid we too are in the dark.

304
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,480
For Iran, of course,

305
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,559
a nuclear weapon is off the table.

306
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,019
We have a treaty.

307
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,572
You have countrymen who are
not too happy about that.

308
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,026
We monitor your nuclear enrichment
program pretty closely,

309
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,863
but black market plutonium-239 from Russia...

310
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,790
Would be difficult for inspectors to detect.

311
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,326
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

312
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,161
Mmm-hmm.

313
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,877
I assure you as Minister of Defense

314
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:02,258
that we in Iran recognize
how much the spirit of comity

315
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,761
between our nations would be compromised

316
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,638
if we were to acquire

317
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,765
weapons-grade plutonium from any source.

318
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,142
Yes, it would.

319
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,940
Same goes for your clients outside Iran,

320
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,643
Hezbollah. Hamas.

321
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,403
The Houthis.

322
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,199
Nuclear weapons are a danger
in any hands, Director.

323
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,151
Wasn't that your pretext for your invasion

324
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,861
of our neighbor to the west?

325
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,288
One that cost 500,000 Iraqi lives

326
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,740
and left a wake of destruction

327
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,666
from which our region has never recovered.

328
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:36,042
General Rostami, we came only
to tell you what we know.

329
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,586
Is that a threat?

330
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,470
Of course not, Minister Behruz.

331
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,139
Gentlemen, I very much
appreciate you meeting with us.

332
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,717
Not at all.

333
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,052
I only wish we could offer more insight.

334
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,136
Thank you.

335
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,700
I don't trust General Rostami.

336
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,404
We need to keep this quiet.

337
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,535
How ready is Orion?

338
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,412
I'll check in with Hurley.

339
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,922
Why is there no one on watch?

340
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,589
You're all dead.

341
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,887
Yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.

342
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:28,885
You're dead.

343
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,093
What?

344
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,055
You wanna say something to me?
Say it. Go on, say it.

345
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,480
You got 30 seconds!

346
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,150
These are your targets.

347
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,073
Memorize them.

348
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,747
It's your responsibility
to be able to identify them.

349
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,577
You shoot a combatant, you get a point.

350
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,627
You miss, you get a shock.

351
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,457
You shoot a noncombatant,
you get a bigger shock.

352
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,008
Combatant shoots you...

353
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,676
Let's just say you're gonna feel it.

354
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,670
Ready?

355
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,299
Go.

356
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,848
What's Hurley doing?

357
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,887
He's fucking with his head.

358
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,895
Fuck!

359
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,352
Fucking AR bullshit.

360
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,378
Shall we?

361
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,338
Okay.

362
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,968
That's clever.

363
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,436
Raw plutonium.

364
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,104
Highly enriched, as promised.

365
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,601
Let's hope.

366
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,108
Wow, that's a beautiful sound, gentlemen.

367
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,276
May I?

368
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,996
Okay.

369
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,539
Wire the money.

370
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,161
That, I can do.

371
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,999
This is a cell phone.

372
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,477
Okay.

373
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,440
It now appears that all seven victims
were shot with a single weapon,

374
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,400
believed to be a Glock 29.

375
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,030
Traces of weaponized plutonium

376
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,486
were detected inside the van

377
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,196
where the bodies of three Russians

378
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,532
and two Warsaw police officers were found.

379
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,583
The Russian government has confirmed

380
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,378
that the chemical footprint
of the plutonium in question

381
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,376
is a match to the plutonium that was stolen

382
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,707
from the decommissioned

383
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,884
processing facility in Tobolsk.

384
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,883
Security footage is being
analyzed by Polish police,

385
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,090
now working in conjunction with Interpol,

386
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,175
to identify the shooter and his connection

387
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,805
to the missing plutonium.

388
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,887
The identity of the shooter
remains unknown...

389
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,928
Hi, excuse me.

390
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,301
How can I help you? Question.

391
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,892
May I help you?

392
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,098
No, thanks. I'm okay.

393
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,795
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

394
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,372
Rapp! God damn it!

395
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,502
You have to stay under control.

396
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,582
Dickhead!

397
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,793
Asshole doesn't know when to quit.

398
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,718
- You're kidding me, right?
- I just saved your ass.

399
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,717
You've gotta know when the mission's
been accomplished, Rapp.

400
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,343
- Sir, he's a fucking...
- Which he did.

401
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,517
Never assume your target is the only target.

402
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,515
The enemy dresses like a deer
and he kills like a lion.

403
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,812
And that's what we gotta do.

404
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,312
We just gotta do it better.

405
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,861
All right.

406
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,405
You're an asshole.

407
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,128
We got a problem.

408
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,584
Six weeks ago, there was a breach

409
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,886
at a decommissioned
Russian plutonium facility.

410
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,381
I'm aware.

411
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,387
What you don't know is 15 kilos
of plutonium went missing.

412
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,139
Weapons-grade.

413
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,016
That's a shit-ton of plutonium.

414
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,438
And it just changed hands.

415
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,352
I wanna show you something.

416
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,439
Take a look at this.

417
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,985
Does that face bong a gong for you?

418
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,444
Or is it just me?

419
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,415
It can't be him.

420
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,837
Our drones took him out after
the embassy bombing at Bamako.

421
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,539
We never got a positive ID.

422
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,750
That's our mad dog out there.

423
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,931
All right. Let's say it's him.

424
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,178
It's him, Irene.

425
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,306
This gives us a chance to kill
two birds with one stone.

426
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,606
Hamdi Sharif.

427
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,275
He's an arms dealer working out of Turkey.

428
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,104
Four days ago, he purchased
a Russian-designed nuclear trigger.

429
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,064
And he's gonna be selling it.

430
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,615
Sharif's got the honey.

431
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,909
Now we just wait for the bee.

432
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,157
We go in, we fuck up their deal.

433
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,408
And we take 'em both out.

434
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,546
You're going to Istanbul.

435
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,794
We have an agent in place.

436
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,000
She'll meet you at the airport.

437
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,129
All right.

438
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,091
Annika Ogden. We've had her
on the ground over there

439
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,922
for five years.

440
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,678
I want Rapp on the team.

441
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:33,884
Really?

442
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,219
He's ready, Stan.

443
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,521
Actually, Irene, he's not ready.

444
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,933
But he will be.

445
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,940
You wanted to see me, sir?

446
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,991
Yeah. Shut the door.

447
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,655
We're shipping out.

448
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,830
Set those down there.

449
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,368
You like movies?

450
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,203
Sure.

451
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,957
I got something for you.

452
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,167
What the fuck is this?

453
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,843
Yeah, I thought so.

454
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,171
- You thought so?
- Yeah.

455
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,348
Why are you even alive, Rapp?

456
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,972
You ever asked yourself that?

457
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,807
Why you? You know, of all those people?

458
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,812
You're special, I guess.

459
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,063
Oh, my God!

460
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,354
You want me to turn it up?

461
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,734
- I'll marry you!
- Take it!

462
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,533
You're a fucking coward, you know that?
Turn that shit off.

463
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,451
What do you think? It's my mom's ring.

464
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,074
You gonna turn it off?

465
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,497
Katrina!

466
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,079
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?

467
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,038
I don't.

468
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,895
You made a big mistake.

469
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,064
You let emotion cloud your judgment.

470
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:07,524
Never, ever let it get personal.

471
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,855
You understand?

472
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,624
Yeah, I got it.

473
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,206
Be ready to go by 5:00.

474
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,542
See you at 4:30.

475
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,643
You know what you're gonna do here?

476
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,721
- No, sir.
- Correct. You don't.

477
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,350
So keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.

478
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,431
And wait for my orders.

479
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:19,471
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate
mogul/arms dealer.

480
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,643
He's like Santa Claus for terrorists.

481
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,100
Scumbag.

482
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,977
Spare me your junior-year-abroad

483
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,308
moral opinion, would you, Rapp?

484
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,019
Not really an opinion, sir.
Sharif's a piece of shit.

485
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,399
It's not a crusade.

486
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,606
This mission is practical. Don't make it...

487
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,816
Personal?

488
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,526
- Exactly.
- Yes, sir.

489
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,827
Victor, you're with me.

490
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,121
Rapp, you and Annika are eyes on.

491
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,450
Sharif has a routine.

492
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,785
Let's see if anything breaks his pattern.

493
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,870
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

494
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,001
All right, we got 48 hours.

495
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,458
Quick, clean. No footprint.

496
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,384
This town's ready to blow as it is.

497
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,130
Where the hell are you going?

498
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,246
That was fucking reckless, Rapp.

499
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,369
I took the initiative, sir.

500
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,041
- He could've been made.
- Well, I wasn't.

501
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,503
Here we go.

502
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,000
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

503
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,208
A meeting at a restaurant on Akbiyik Street.

504
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,294
That's right before Sharif
goes to see his mistress.

505
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,673
That breaks his pattern.

506
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,130
I'll tell you what'll break his pattern.

507
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,715
When that fucking assistant tells his boss

508
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,016
he lost his goddamn phone.

509
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,344
He won't.

510
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,100
He's too afraid of Sharif to let him know
he screwed up.

511
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,102
All right. We go tomorrow.

512
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,182
What's the mission, sir?

513
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,233
Eliminate the target.
Eliminate the recipient.

514
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,436
Obtain the package.

515
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,112
And what's the package?

516
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,234
We'll know it when we see it.

517
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,654
You're lead.

518
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,780
You're backup.

519
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,520
He thinks we're married.

520
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,405
Don't think too much.

521
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,989
You'll lose your nerve.

522
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,283
No, I don't think so.

523
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,833
It'll be your first time.

524
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,376
Yeah, not in my mind.

525
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,988
Lead, your friend's arriving now.

526
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,314
Copy.

527
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,705
And he brought a shitload
of military protection.

528
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,967
I'll take care of the MPs.

529
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,103
Oh, come on, now, honey. Don't be mad.

530
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,222
No, no, no.

531
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,557
I had a few. Yeah, I did.

532
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:37,892
I'll make it up to you when I get home.

533
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,396
You know that.

534
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,791
Call it in. Call it in,
or I'll cut your fucking throat.

535
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,109
Lead, you're a go.

536
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,067
Survey 2, get in place.

537
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,367
Be careful in there. I got it.

538
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,411
Pardon.

539
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,286
Target's gone. Target's gone.

540
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,744
Get back!

541
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,453
Lead?

542
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,080
Dead.

543
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:07,999
Mission terminated.

544
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,383
Exfil to secure location. Confirm.

545
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,807
Survey 2, you better let me
hear you fucking confirm.

546
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,057
God damn it, this is a fucking mess.
We're out of here.

547
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,308
Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you.

548
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,315
I'm gonna hurt your boss.

549
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,976
Shit.

550
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,194
Hurry up!

551
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,629
Come on, come on, come on.

552
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:21,925
Come on.

553
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,542
No, please.

554
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,837
Please, don't. Don't.

555
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,673
No.

556
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,986
You disobeyed a direct order.

557
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,322
No, I made a decision to pursue
the target, and I completed the mission.

558
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,199
And, sir, isn't that what I'm here to do?
Isn't that my job?

559
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,248
Your fucking job is to do
what I fucking tell you to do!

560
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,292
What, you prefer I leave him alive,
then, let him go? That piece of shit?

561
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,374
Stan?

562
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,630
Good, you're here.
I wanna show you something.

563
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,710
Wait here.

564
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,971
Look at that. That's the kind
of bullshit that could shut us down.

565
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,098
Kid can't even follow a fucking order.

566
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,145
Victor got made. Rapp didn't.

567
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,599
Why does this kid give you
such a fucking hard-on?

568
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,605
Don't talk to me like that!
I'm your superior.

569
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,685
My superior, Irene?

570
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,236
Your superior, God damn it.

571
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,698
Do you have any idea how long I spent looking

572
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,616
for someone with that kid's talent and balls?

573
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,694
Rapp stays.

574
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,279
You're giving me an order?

575
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,454
That's an affirmative.

576
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,620
Can you give us a minute?

577
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,838
Look at this.

578
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,591
The trigger must have been in that car.

579
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,716
Look at him.

580
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,141
Lookin' at me.

581
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,223
Everything he did there,

582
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,520
I taught him how to do it.

583
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,393
Stan.

584
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,566
I should've left him in the Navy.

585
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,893
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

586
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:01,103
Stan, listen to me.

587
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,113
The only thing that matters now is that
fucking lunatic has everything he needs

588
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,235
to build a nuclear weapon.

589
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,741
He's got a trigger.
Now he needs to buy a physicist.

590
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,415
We just have to figure out
where they're gonna build this thing.

591
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,959
Ben.

592
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,913
That computer our boy Rapp
lifted from Sharif's house,

593
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:23,250
there's evidence of a $2 million
transfer to a bank account in Rome.

594
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,959
Cash prepped for withdrawal.

595
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,089
Rome.

596
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,262
Your money.

597
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,716
I've been reading up, Minister.

598
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,928
You Iranians probably
all learn this growing up,

599
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,138
or at least you did before
you signed that treaty.

600
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,517
But me, I had no idea about these fun facts.

601
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,271
Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

602
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,944
Inside three miles,
apparently you just vaporize.

603
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,199
Some folks don't.

604
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,373
They get all black and charred,

605
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:22,577
and dense as lead, and no one knows why.

606
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:26,130
Inside five miles,
everything is sucked into a void,

607
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,424
hotter than the core of the sun.

608
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,845
How about that?

609
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,927
You'll get the rest of your money
when the job's done.

610
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,311
Where is my physicist?

611
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,688
He'll pick up his money,
then we'll pick him up.

612
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:52,066
We'll need an extra day to configure
the weapon, then it's all yours.

613
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,321
Kill as many Jews as you want.

614
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,329
Do you practice Salah, brother?

615
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,786
I receive my payment, complete the project.

616
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,464
That's my practice, brother.

617
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,586
Very well.

618
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:43,909
Who was that guy?

619
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,876
In Istanbul.

620
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:50,920
It seemed like he was a step ahead of us.

621
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,674
Hey, you gonna fill me in here or what?

622
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,097
There's some bad people planning
on doing some bad things,

623
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,390
and it's our job to stop them.

624
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,183
You still haven't said anything about Victor.

625
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:06,855
Victor's gone. Victor doesn't exist.

626
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,898
What is it you think we do here, Rapp?

627
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,160
I think we kill people who need to be killed.

628
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,237
And who do you trust to tell you?

629
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,663
I follow orders.

630
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,456
No, you follow orders when they suit you.

631
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:25,875
This whole thing is pretty much

632
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,829
just a means to an end for you, isn't it?

633
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,379
A lot's happened in my life, sir.

634
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,422
- Really? Huh.
- Yeah.

635
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,750
So you think you were sent here

636
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:36,177
as an outlet for your self-pity,

637
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,427
and your anger, and all your guilt. Right?

638
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,766
Patriotism exists

639
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,847
because people like you and people
like me need a higher cause.

640
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,057
Something bigger than us.

641
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,017
That stink coming outta you

642
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,945
you like to call "revenge,"
the rest of us call "shit."

643
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,613
And as soon as it starts to feel good,

644
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,406
that's when you stop being a professional.

645
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,733
And then what are you?

646
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,034
Tell us something good, darling.

647
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,914
We're in their system.

648
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:15,046
The moment that transfer from
Sharif's account is picked up,

649
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,001
we'll know it.

650
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,929
Boy, you just smile, and the Red Sea parts.

651
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,132
Works in the Med, too.

652
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,718
I'll bet it does.

653
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:43,073
Cash withdrawal from Sharif's account.
$2 million, U.S.

654
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,903
There's our physicist. Let's go.

655
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,753
Welcome to the Boscolo and enjoy your stay.

656
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,421
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

657
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,049
He's in 1448.

658
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,850
And we're next door.

659
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:00,832
Code in.

660
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:01,962
Victor-Charlie 1109.

661
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,714
Confirmed.

662
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,011
Suite 1448. We're in 1449, right next door.

663
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,090
All right. We'll grab the physicist,

664
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,346
and we'll take out whosever coming for him.

665
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,972
Signal every 15 minutes.

666
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:55,728
Hey.

667
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,156
I know what happened to you.

668
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:10,822
I'm sorry.

669
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,543
I understand you.

670
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,087
More than you know.

671
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,470
I know what it's like
to lose people you love.

672
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,898
We're gonna get these fuckers.

673
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,532
Fuck!

674
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,042
Where the hell are you?

675
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,018
Hurley...

676
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,569
Where is he?

677
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,401
I don't know what you're talking...

678
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:48,882
Where is he?

679
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,717
He outside?

680
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,678
Please, no.

681
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,511
Please.

682
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:46,682
Hurley, what the fuck?

683
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,187
I thought you were eyes on,
why didn't you spot 'em?

684
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,611
They were already in the damn hotel.

685
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,154
Local mafia's working with 'em.

686
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,704
I'll tell Kennedy we have the physicist.

687
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,631
What the hell just happened out there, huh?

688
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,424
That's twice now this guy's
blown up our entire op.

689
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,923
What's the target? Huh? What's the target?

690
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:16,129
- I don't know, mister.
- Yeah, you do.

691
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,801
Huh?

692
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:19,882
Do you think I'm stupid?

693
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,638
He's an American. He said your name.

694
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,139
Did you train this guy?

695
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,472
- You like to smoke?
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

696
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,023
- Are you a smoker?
- I don't...

697
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,850
- Wait!
- Bad habit.

698
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,311
Wait, stop! Wait, wait! I know something.

699
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:33,862
- What do you know?
- I know something.

700
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,737
There is a man... There is
a man they call Ghost.

701
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,821
Ghost. I think it was an Iranian man said it.

702
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:42,905
Uh-huh. Where are they building the bomb?

703
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,285
- I just took the money.
- Where are they building it?

704
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,241
Where are they building it?

705
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,168
All right, here.
Take some time to think about it.

706
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,622
Ghost. Is that his name?

707
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:55,259
Why is this guy after you?

708
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,007
Something personal, sir?

709
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,712
They're building a nuke.

710
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,760
Hotel Navona.

711
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,560
- Clean yourself up.
- Wait.

712
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,980
Don't go.

713
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,858
America's president
has ordered the Sixth Fleet

714
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,186
out of the U.S. Naval base in Naples, Italy.

715
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,737
The Sixth Fleet is now
southwest off the coast...

716
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,232
Let me help you.

717
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:19,533
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

718
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:20,860
You're not.

719
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,845
How are you holding up?

720
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,977
I was afraid today.

721
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,806
I thought we were going to die.

722
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,141
Yeah, I'm either always afraid
or never afraid.

723
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,726
I don't know which.

724
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,290
There you go.

725
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,628
Just relax now.

726
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,391
We'll search for Ghost tomorrow.

727
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,034
You scared me.

728
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,952
Who are you?

729
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,120
What do you mean?

730
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,448
You said "Ghost."

731
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,704
- What about him?
- I never told you that name.

732
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,251
Hurley did.

733
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:55,170
Yeah, I think you're full of shit.

734
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,542
- Mitch.
- Who are you?

735
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,295
- Mitch, what's wrong with you?
- Who do you work for?

736
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,462
I'm CIA.

737
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,670
Now don't fucking lie to me!

738
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,880
I'm not lying!

739
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,049
You're Iranian, aren't you?

740
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,475
Get the fuck away from me!

741
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,688
Are you working with the Iranians?

742
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,783
Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth!

743
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,085
You Iranian intelligence?

744
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,258
Are you Iranian intelligence?

745
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,764
What do you know about Ghost?

746
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,490
We're gonna need the decryption device.

747
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,043
You were right, Mitch.

748
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,592
This Iranian mole is a tough nut to crack.

749
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:26,011
All I could get from her
was her handler. Azad Ashani.

750
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,304
Happens to be a friend of mine.

751
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,756
I'm gonna go pay him a visit.

752
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,058
- Okay, I'm going with you.
- No.

753
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,601
I need you to stay here.

754
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,303
Kennedy's on her way with the CIA team

755
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,387
and a Mossad team.

756
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,688
She's gonna ask me where you went.

757
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:37,764
What the hell am I supposed to say?

758
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,521
That's right, she is.
And you're gonna be smart,

759
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:42,564
and you're gonna keep your mouth shut,
and you're gonna cover my ass.

760
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,671
I still have it.

761
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,141
Very nice.

762
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,725
I am always happy to meet you, Stan...

763
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,644
But never happy why.

764
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:25,354
Well, maybe next time we'll meet for pizza.

765
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,484
Your girl's tough, by the way.

766
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,284
Go easy on her.

767
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,451
She's my niece.

768
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,156
Yeah.

769
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,040
What have you got for me?

770
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:48,377
The men behind all this are General Rostami,

771
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,884
our military chief of staff,

772
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,761
and our defense minister, Behruz.

773
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,013
Both are very powerful,

774
01:11:56,103 --> 01:12:00,222
and both are very angry about
the nuclear treaty we made with you.

775
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,103
They have been trying to acquire

776
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,981
nuclear materials for the past two years.

777
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,278
And they are the ones

778
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,232
who hired the mercenary called Ghost.

779
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:15,196
Rostami is now in Tehran,
but Behruz is here in Rome.

780
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:20,159
Annika has been tracking
his movements through his cell phone.

781
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,369
And they're building it here?

782
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,044
I wish I knew.

783
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,751
We have their physicist.

784
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:26,832
They can't build it without him.

785
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:27,916
But...

786
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,966
The mercenary asked Behruz

787
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,799
to use one of ours, an Iranian.

788
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:38,556
Behruz agreed. That was rash.

789
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,433
It means they are in a hurry.

790
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,225
And the target's Israel?

791
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,185
I wish I had better information for you.

792
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,203
Where the hell is Hurley?

793
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,872
You gotta tell me what's going on here. Now.

794
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,870
That guy he trained, who the hell is he?

795
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,701
That's not something you
need to know right now.

796
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,787
What are you covering up?

797
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,838
When you've got a level-5 security clearance

798
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,415
and 20 years' experience, talk to me.

799
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,341
Until then, shut up and do your job.

800
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,467
I want her cell phone decrypted and scanned.

801
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,268
Local PD pulled a body
from the harbor an hour ago.

802
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,344
Gunshot to the chest.

803
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,897
Iranian intelligence officer, Azad Ashani.

804
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,225
Christ!

805
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:27,981
That's the guy Hurley went to meet.

806
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,982
Stupid son of a bitch!

807
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,654
All right, so what do we do?
We gotta go after him.

808
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,983
There's a fucking nuke in play, Rapp.

809
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,365
That's the mission, and the only mission.

810
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,071
This is now a joint CIA-Mossad operation,

811
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:40,451
whether we like it or not.

812
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,782
Can you get the Director on the phone?

813
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,993
So you're just gonna write him off then?

814
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,827
That's the plan?

815
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,084
Stan Hurley is the closest
thing to family I've got.

816
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,464
And if he were standing here
right now, his only question would be,

817
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,383
why are we wasting our breath
talking about him?

818
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,546
You're through here.

819
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,051
You're going home, that's an order.

820
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,516
Now, sit down and shut up.

821
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:54,108
Why are you helping me?

822
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,064
Your handler Ashani was killed.

823
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,865
Hurley was with him. Something happened.

824
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:58,988
I'm going after him.

825
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,033
I need your help.

826
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:06,366
We gotta go.

827
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,936
Stan.

828
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,147
I've looked forward to this.

829
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,152
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

830
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:40,863
I wanna show you something.

831
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,319
All right.

832
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,796
Savages. Right, Stan?

833
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,263
But you know something? I don't blame them.

834
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,673
I blame you.

835
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,430
Never would've happened if you
would have followed orders, Ronnie.

836
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,477
"You go down out there, you're a ghost.

837
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,896
"You're a John Doe.

838
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,224
"You get captured?"

839
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,685
Oh, you remember. That's very gratifying.

840
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:15,769
Thank you.

841
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,354
You made me proud today, Ron.

842
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,441
You should've come for me.

843
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,406
Ten men would've died.

844
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:25,863
You put 10 men's lives in danger,

845
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,913
'cause you couldn't follow a fucking order.

846
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,286
- Fuck you.
- Fuck orders.

847
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,958
- Fuck the mission!
- Fuck you.

848
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,412
This was me. I was your boy, I believe that.

849
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,542
You made me believe that.

850
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,184
Ashani had their people tracking
Minister Behruz's secure cell phone.

851
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:51,354
So, we find Behruz, we find Hurley.

852
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,281
Mitch!

853
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,703
Oh, yeah, look at that.

854
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,329
Did you learn that in Aleppo?

855
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,752
No.

856
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,830
You always told us what to expect, Stan.

857
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,004
Now, where's the rest of your team?

858
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,049
Come on, Ronnie, really?

859
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:10,884
Don't call me that.
Where's the rest of your team?

860
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:13,436
Your new boy out there, he on my tail?

861
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,731
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
There's your first mistake.

862
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,730
You never start with a real question.

863
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,903
You start slow.

864
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,776
You get inside your subject's head.

865
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:27,530
Stan, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

866
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:30,283
There's your second mistake. Number two.

867
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:33,115
You don't say, "one more time."
You already...

868
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,916
Damn!

869
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,214
Now, what's that third mistake, Stan?

870
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,166
Huh? What is it?

871
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,092
Go ahead! Go ahead!

872
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,512
I got nine more! I like this.

873
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,931
I like it. Go ahead, bring it on!

874
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:51,133
You motherfucker!

875
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,559
Ronnie wants to know if I got a team outside.

876
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:57,765
Right, Ron?

877
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,315
If it's safe to move your bomb.

878
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,061
Are we being followed?

879
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,485
Where's the new me?

880
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,988
I've done my research. I know all about him.

881
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,616
"The new me..." Oh, you mean Mitch?

882
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,913
You know, Mitch, he's unpredictable.

883
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,581
You never know about Mitch.

884
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:17,079
He might be here, he might be there.

885
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:18,831
He's like you, but you're a real Section 8.

886
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:19,911
Enough.

887
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,122
- Schizo mom.
- Where are they?

888
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,752
- Loser dad.
- Where are they?

889
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,127
God!

890
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,010
Where's the rest of your team?

891
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,592
Half-wit mom, psycho dad...

892
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:34,802
Where's the rest of your team?

893
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,261
- You're pond scum.
- Where are they?

894
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,597
Pond scum! You're fucking...

895
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:50,741
I'm sorry about your handler.

896
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,153
Ashani was my uncle.

897
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,123
I'm sure it was Minister Behruz

898
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,701
and General Rostami who had him killed.

899
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,879
They want nuclear war with Israel.

900
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:04,706
We tried to stop them.

901
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,508
My brother and father
both died fighting them.

902
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,346
Corviale. Turn here.

903
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,179
You know what my real mistake was?

904
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:22,565
I trusted you.

905
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,610
You made me feel like
I was the Second Coming.

906
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,443
And you acted like my father.

907
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:35,996
I trusted you and I trusted
the United States Navy.

908
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,879
U.S. of A. does it, it's gotta be good.
Right, Stan?

909
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,967
Except

910
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:53,218
nobody told me the business
y'all are really in.

911
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,389
You create monsters.

912
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:59,845
That's just what you do.

913
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,519
Those people who did this to me,

914
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,771
you think they're barbarians?

915
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,606
Bullshit.

916
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,282
Where's the decryption I asked for?

917
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,207
Rapp grabbed her smartphone
before we could get any of it.

918
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,409
And we can't find him.

919
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,210
Surveillance cameras picked up Rapp

920
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,288
taking out our agents five minutes ago.

921
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,422
What the hell are you doing?

922
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,636
There's not a single thing happening here

923
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:42,937
that you didn't make happen.

924
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,351
God bless fucking America, huh, Stan?

925
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:51,145
Hoorah!

926
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,156
Hoorah!

927
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,323
I can tell you where Mitch is...

928
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:00,247
What's that third mistake, Stan?

929
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,322
Mitch...

930
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,407
I can't hear you.

931
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,575
Fuck!

932
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:10,832
Third mistake,

933
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,589
never get too close.

934
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,762
Finish your personal business here.

935
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,180
Your work is done.

936
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:18,723
The bomb is armed.

937
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,391
- Timer is set up?
- Yes.

938
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,467
He's playing you.

939
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,645
Bomb's not for you, it's for him.

940
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,312
It was his plan all along!

941
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,714
Dead zone.

942
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,094
We're not getting any signals here.

943
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,522
Come on. Come on.

944
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,316
Wait a second.

945
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,505
What are you gonna do with it?

946
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,010
No, Stan.

947
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,721
"What are we gonna do with it?"

948
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,064
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

949
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,601
I like Rome.

950
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:53,730
It's good food.

951
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:01,948
Never, ever thought I'd die in the field.

952
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,245
Ain't it crazy?

953
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:08,291
I always figured it would be, I don't know,

954
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:12,747
some cabin in the woods with my dog.

955
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:14,421
Me?

956
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,750
I think I want water.

957
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:19,927
There's just something
peaceful about dying at sea.

958
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:25,926
All right.

959
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,558
Let's get it over with.

960
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,890
No, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

961
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,020
I ain't gonna kill you.

962
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,272
You're gonna live to see

963
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,274
the crown of your creation, Stan.

964
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,487
Thousands of Americans are gonna burn.

965
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,277
All because of you.

966
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:47,447
Enjoy the show.

967
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,575
Get ready.

968
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:31,741
Go.

969
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,068
Please help me.

970
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:47,825
Annika.

971
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:06,919
Whoa!

972
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:20,455
We've got an explosion detected.

973
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:22,544
Here.

974
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,668
A half click off the Fiumicino waterways.

975
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,167
It's underground.

976
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,967
- Delta One, go!
- Let's go.

977
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:30,670
Get a chopper out there.

978
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,036
You're not supposed to be here, Rapp.

979
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,996
Yeah, what are you gonna do, fire me?

980
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,549
There's another passage down there.
He's got the nuke.

981
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:10,752
- You gonna be good?
- Go. Go!

982
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,209
Put the gun down.

983
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:53,920
Or she's dead.

984
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:58,008
I want to see my family, Mitch.

985
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,894
No, Annika, you don't.

986
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,437
I want to see my family.

987
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,560
Come on, Mitch. Be nice.

988
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,141
She wants to live.

989
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:09,352
She wants to see her family.

990
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:10,436
Put the gun down.

991
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,065
Annika!

992
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,143
The bomb can't be stopped.

993
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,523
Just like you couldn't stop

994
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,196
that beautiful girl from dying on the beach.

995
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,073
Irene.

996
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,118
The bomb's on a boat.

997
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,449
Hurley?

998
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,750
How do you know?

999
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:32,328
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

1000
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:38,591
Is the Sixth Fleet out on maneuvers?

1001
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:42,258
Oh, my God.

1002
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:43,338
Bring up ISR feeds.

1003
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:45,095
Get me eyes in the sky over the coastline

1004
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,768
and put the Sixth Fleet on nuclear alert.

1005
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:49,261
Tom.

1006
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:52,814
The target is the Sixth Fleet
and it's 25 miles offshore.

1007
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:01,732
It's a shame.

1008
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:06,161
The last thing your girl saw
was you not saving her.

1009
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:19,170
General quarters.

1010
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,092
All hands, man your stations.

1011
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:24,092
This is not a drill.
I repeat, this is not a drill.

1012
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,925
Inbound, small vessel-borne nuclear device.

1013
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:28,475
Man decon stations.

1014
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,938
Didn't Hurley teach you
anything, little brother?

1015
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:43,942
To never make it personal.

1016
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:56,749
This isn't personal.

1017
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:05,758
Shit.

1018
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:10,346
The bomb has a timer and a release trigger.

1019
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:13,053
We take out his boat, it'll detonate.

1020
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,060
If it goes off above the waterline...

1021
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:18,018
Disaster. There'll be fallout
all over the mainland.

1022
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:22,689
USS Flynn...

1023
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,569
Prepare to engage.

1024
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:36,835
The boat is turning, sir.

1025
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,457
Who's driving that boat?

1026
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:42,916
Rapp.

1027
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,129
Go.

1028
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:49,135
Sir? Go!

1029
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,354
What are you doing? Hurley.

1030
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:00,525
Hurley?

1031
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:02,604
Trying to get our boy to throw
the bomb in the water.

1032
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,690
Flynn, you are clear to fire when ready.

1033
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:08,651
Do not fire, Commander. The boat is turning.

1034
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:11,533
If we don't engage,
that guarantees detonation.

1035
01:35:11,623 --> 01:35:12,864
I understand there's a risk,

1036
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,368
but this is the best chance we've got.

1037
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,416
Shit! God damn it!

1038
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,217
There he is.

1039
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,341
Get me on that boat's marine bandwidth.

1040
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,217
Rapp!

1041
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,514
Rapp!

1042
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:38,097
Can you hear me? Pick up the radio!

1043
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:40,979
Throw the bomb overboard!

1044
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:43,231
No way, sir, I gotta get
further away from the fleet!

1045
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:44,732
Rapp!

1046
01:35:44,822 --> 01:35:47,360
For once in your life, take a goddamn order!

1047
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,362
The Sixth Fleet is about to blow you to hell!

1048
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,454
Command, Delta Two,

1049
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:03,834
the bomb's in the water.

1050
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:06,383
Commander, hold your fire!
The bomb's in the water.

1051
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,335
Flynn, hold fire!

1052
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,419
Hold fire!

1053
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:10,925
Hold fire!

1054
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,953
Got less than 30 seconds.

1055
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:47,924
All right, go! Get outta here!

1056
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:09,605
Jesus.

1057
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:51,688
Brace for impact.

1058
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:53,069
Sir, yes, sir!

1059
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:59,989
Holy shit.

1060
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:41,705
Hold on!

1061
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:55,961
Brace!

1062
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:38,837
You shouldn't have come for me.

1063
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:42,637
Don't get used to it, son.

1064
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,554
Hurley...

1065
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:49,981
Looks like we're gonna be all right up here.

1066
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:51,808
I think.

1067
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:59,275
Damage control central. Report.

1068
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:00,734
Pressure is normalizing.

1069
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,911
We have multiple hull breaches.

1070
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,659
Radiologicals, Eisenhower?

1071
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,615
Low... Low levels.

1072
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,244
Initiating countermeasure wash-down.

1073
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:12,170
Commander, any casualties?

1074
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,122
The Flynn took some serious damage.

1075
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:16,083
The casualty reports aren't in yet,

1076
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:19,136
but if it had gone off above
the waterline, I don't think we'd be here.

1077
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,633
Eisenhower,

1078
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:23,841
my prayers are with you all.

1079
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:47,573
Hurley, is Rapp there?

1080
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:49,791
Hold on a minute.

1081
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:56,005
Yeah, go ahead.

1082
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:57,583
You okay, Mitch?

1083
01:40:57,677 --> 01:40:59,418
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

1084
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,637
You saved a lot of lives today.

1085
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:10,012
Took some losses, too.

1086
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:16,791
What the hell are you looking at?

1087
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:18,588
You look like a mummy.

1088
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,040
Yeah.

1089
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:22,126
Well...

1090
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,302
A mummy doesn't have to write up reports.

1091
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:26,755
Dictate them. You should be good at that.

1092
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:30,470
Iranian official, General Rostami,

1093
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,427
the leader of the minority
opposition in Tehran,

1094
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:34,934
claims that he has proof that a secret group

1095
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:37,266
of assassins within America's CIA

1096
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,977
are responsible for
last week's nuclear event.

1097
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:43,113
With the Iranian presidential election
just two weeks away,

1098
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:46,943
General Rostami continues
to rise in popularity.

1099
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:50,320
They say General Rostami is
gonna be the next President of Iran.

1100
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:51,495
Yeah.

1101
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:53,949
He didn't even have to blow
up Israel to get there.

1102
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:55,955
He's gonna be a major pain in the ass, too.

1103
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:58,458
Where's Rapp? I can't reach him.

1104
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:00,288
How the hell do I know where Rapp is?

1105
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:01,669
I'm a mummy in a hospital.

1106
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:04,172
Rostami has full support for restarting

1107
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:05,968
Iran's nuclear program.
