{\fs12}...and the women hardly wore anything at all. Very intelligent of them.{\r}

10
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,983
三個妞幫你搧涼，你只管躺在吊床上
{\fs12}You just lie there in a hammock while three of them fan you.{\r}

22
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,556
你應該知道不該愚弄我們的隊長，除非是女人
{\fs12}You ought to know better than to try fooling our captain. Only dames can do that.{\r}

23
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,725
-戴克斯中尉，我保證...    -說溜了嘴

...很想談談，就是麥克連將軍

告訴福格蒂將軍你想去西雅圖，帕特和我會載你去

我也見過麥克連將軍了
{\fs12}I met General McLaren too.{\r}

29
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,410
西雅圖很溫暖，那裡的女孩不皮褲的
{\fs12}It's warm in Seattle. They got girls there without fur pants on.{\r}

30
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,788
-隊長，怎麼樣？      -應該可行
{\fs12}-What about it, captain?    -That could be right.{\r}

他們離這裡北方約兩千英里處，一整群

亨德利隊長可以提供關於她的所有資訊
{\fs12}Capt. Hendry can give you any data on her.{\r}

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,356
-或許你不該說那些      -等我讀完...
{\fs12}-You probably shouldn't have said that.   -Well, after I read...{\r}

41
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,774
現在看！
{\fs12}Now look!{\r}

希望有一天，我有導航員和副駕駛各一
至少他們的耳後是乾的
{\fs12}Someday I hope to have a navigator and a copilot who are at least dry behind the ears.{\r}

亨德利隊長，請立即去福格蒂將軍的宿舍報到
{\fs12}Capt. Hendry, report to General Fogarty's quarters at once please.{\r}

45
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:07,414
晚上8點，將軍對部隊大吼大叫，像是回到從前
{\fs12}8:00 at night and the general yelling for his troops. Sounds like the old days.{\r}

46
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,124
-替一下手 好嗎？       -好啊
{\fs12}-Take my hand. Will you?    -Yeah.{\r}

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,711
隊長，如果有任何差事，帶我去。拜託？
{\fs12}Captain, if it amounts to anything,
bring me in on it. Will you, please?{\r}

48
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,379
當然。
{\fs12}Sure.{\r}

49
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,382
我得去某個地方找新聞

{\fs12}Not many places to hide, sir.{\r}

54
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,497
剛得自北方一則奇怪的信息，卡林頓博士親自發送
{\fs12}Just got a queer message from your picnic party up north,
from Dr. Carrington himself.{\r}

64
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,035
那次是無法避免的意外
{\fs12}That was an unavoidable accident.{\r}

65
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,330

這兒再也沒有人跟我報告事情了

{\fs12}A little headwind? Close to 40 miles.{\r}

77
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,675

{\fs12}Our captain has some funny ideas about the North Pole.{\r}

78

{\fs12}He thinks it's a garden spot. Come and bring the kiddies.{\r}

79
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,515
嘿，你們兩個不要鬧了
{\fs12}Now look, don't you two guys start.{\r}

80
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:17,356
你知道，佩里曾去過北極，得了一大堆獎章退休
{\fs12}You know, Perry went to the North Pole once.

{\fs12}We go there every three weeks just like it was lover's lane.{\r}

83
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:24,533
史考特先生，有人似乎想...等一下
{\fs12}Mr. Scott, some people seem to think... Wait a minute.{\r}

84

{\fs12}What's on your mind, Tex?{\r}

89
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,440
我們這裡有一些干擾，全部都被搞亂了
{\fs12}We've got some disturbance up here. It's whacking away at everything.{\r}

90
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:48,862
-你覺得干擾源在哪裡？  -不知道，昨晚才注意

94
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,839
我就怕你會這樣說
{\fs12}I was afraid you'd say that.{\r}

95
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,828
嘿，納稅人應該來看看

{\fs12}I happened to be in Anchorage when your message came.
I hope you have a good story.{\r}

106
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:20,507
-不會比你知道的還多    -什麼都沒有？
{\fs12}-No more than you know already.   -Nothing more at all?{\r}

107
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,803
只是討論它可能是什麼，大家的想法分歧
{\fs12}Just discussions as to what it might be.
We all have different ideas.{\r}

108
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,390
-還有一些爭議    -卡林頓博士在哪兒？
{\fs12}-There's been arguments about it.
-Where's Dr. Carrington?{\r}

109
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:27,850
-在實驗室       -回頭見
{\fs12}-In the lab.      -See you later.{\r}

110
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,852
這麼說...你看過這架飛機嗎？
{\fs12}Does that mean you've seen the plane?{\r}

111
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,355
-咖啡，隊長？       -不用了，謝謝
{\fs12}-Coffee, captain?     -No, thanks.{\r}

112
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:33,233
李，我們的隊長似乎很匆忙
{\fs12}Our captain seems in a hurry, Lee.{\r}

113
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:35,319
-你們兩個要去哪？   -跟你一起去
{\fs12}-Where are you two going?    -We're with you.{\r}

114
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,199
-我們想去質疑她對你不好  -如果不要我們...
{\fs12}-We want to tell her she treated you badly.
-If you don't want us to go...{\r}

115
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:42,371
-改天再跟你們算帳    -我們在那裡起床
{\fs12}-I'm gonna get even with you two someday.   -We got up in there.{\r}

116
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,719
進來吧
{\fs12}Come in.{\r}

117
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:56,307
嗨，帕特。歡迎來到我們的冰屋。你好嗎...？
{\fs12}Hi, Pat. Welcome to our igloo. How was your...?{\r}

118
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,604
呃...
{\fs12}Well...{\r}

119
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,903
-旅途愉快吧？      -跟平常一樣
{\fs12}-How was your trip?   -All right. About usual.{\r}

120
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,572
嗯，那就好
{\fs12}Well, that's fine.{\r}

121
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,828
-卡林頓博士想見你  -他不急，我想和你談
{\fs12}-I think Dr. Carrington wants to see you.
-He can wait. I wanna talk to you.{\r}

122
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,040
-關於什麼？   -就是你玩的骯髒伎倆
{\fs12}-What about?   -That was a dirty trick you played.{\r}

123
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:16,294
-別發脾氣   -為何那麼做？告訴我為什麼
{\fs12}-Don't lose your temper.
-Why did you do it? Just tell me why.{\r}

124
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:18,714
你的腿不是很漂亮
{\fs12}Well, your legs aren't very pretty.{\r}

125
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:21,926
你沒必要寫一張便條 放在我的胸前
{\fs12}You didn't have to write a note and put it on my chest.{\r}

126
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,095
對不起，帕特...
{\fs12}I'm sorry, Pat...{\r}

127
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:26,391
我醒來之前 有六個人看過 現在全空軍皆知了
{\fs12}Six people read it before I woke up.
Now the whole Air Force knows.{\r}

128
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,811
-別那麼大聲，別人會聽見  -他們都聽過了
{\fs12}-Not so loud. They'll hear.   -They already heard.{\r}

129
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,940
只差沒在公佈欄公告而已
{\fs12}The only place it hasn't been is on a billboard.{\r}

130
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:34,694
我不知道你有這麼討厭的脾氣
{\fs12}I didn't know you had such a nasty temper.{\r}

131
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:37,407
帕特，請息怒。放輕鬆一點
{\fs12}Now, Pat, just be careful. Now take it easy.{\r}

132
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:39,326
等一等
{\fs12}Now wait a minute.{\r}

133
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:42,080
上次你來這裡時，我們玩得很開心
{\fs12}We had a lot of fun when you were up here.{\r}

134
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:45,210
然後當你邀我去安克拉治時，你故意餵我...
{\fs12}Then when you asked me down to Anchorage, you deliberately fed me...{\r}

135
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,589
告訴我，你真的把那些飲料全喝了嗎？
{\fs12}Tell me, did you really drink all those drinks?{\r}

136
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:50,176
-你沒扔掉任何東西？一個都沒有？ -沒有
{\fs12}-You didn't throw any away? Not one?   -No.{\r}

137
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,637
老天，我還以為我很棒
{\fs12}Holy cat. I thought I was good.{\r}

138
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,807
還有一件事，你為什麼要走？
{\fs12}And another thing, why did you leave?{\r}

139
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,977
當我早上醒來時你已經走了
{\fs12}When I woke up in the morning you were gone.{\r}

140
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:59,563
我告訴過你 我必須把那架貨機帶回來
{\fs12}I told you I had to take that cargo plane back here.{\r}

141
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:01,399
-你告訴過我？   -你不記得嗎？
{\fs12}-You told me?   -Don't you remember?{\r}

142
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,110
不
{\fs12}No.{\r}

143
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:07,909
晚餐後，你告訴我關於在舊金山的某晚...
{\fs12}Right after dinner. You were telling me all about a night in San Francisco...{\r}

144
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:09,744
我告訴過你那個？
{\fs12}Did I tell you that?{\r}

145
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,208
我還做了什麼？
{\fs12}What else did I do?{\r}

146
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,795
曾有一度你有點像一隻章魚。
{\fs12}Well, you had moments of kind of making like an octopus.{\r}

147
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:20,969
-我一生中未曾見過這麼多手   -好了，好了
{\fs12}-I never saw so many hands in all my life.
-All right. All right.{\r}

148
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:24,849
嘿，我唯一的藉口是我喜歡你...
{\fs12}Look, my only excuse is that I liked you...{\r}

149
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,727
...立刻的
{\fs12}...right away.{\r}

150
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,942
-原來是錯誤的開始，不能重來嗎？  -你要怎樣開始？
{\fs12}-So I started wrong. Can't we begin again?
-How would you begin?{\r}

151
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,529
-我能想到幾個...     -別麻煩了
{\fs12}-Well, I can think of several...   -Never mind.{\r}

152
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:36,908
無論如何，我們現在沒那時間
{\fs12}We don't have time for that now anyway.{\r}

153
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,746
我知道卡林頓博士正等著見你
{\fs12}I know Dr. Carrington's waiting to see you.{\r}

154
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:49,132
-重新開始要怎麼辦？   -稍後再談吧
{\fs12}-What about this business of starting over?
-We'll talk about that later.{\r}

155
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,847
-你好，隊長       -嗨，教授
{\fs12}-Hello, captain.    -Hi, professor.{\r}

156
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:09,954
-卡林頓博士，亨德利隊長來了  -我知道
{\fs12}-Dr. Carrington, Capt. Hendry is here.   -Yes, I know.{\r}

157
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:11,956
久仰了，隊長？      -博士
{\fs12}-How do you do, captain?    -Doctor.{\r}

158
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,502
尼克森小姐，你能在筆記上添上一則嗎？
{\fs12}Miss Nicholson, would you add a note to the others?{\r}

159
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,753
當然
{\fs12}Surely.{\r}

160
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:19,968
11月2日 上午11:30
{\fs12}November 2, 11:30 a.m.{\r}

161
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:25,143
第19區的偏差持續向東12度20分
{\fs12}Deviation in sector 19 continues 12 degrees, 20 minutes east.{\r}

162
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,855
干擾因素沒有減少或搖擺不定
{\fs12}No lessening or wavering of disturbing element.{\r}

163
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,566
就這樣
{\fs12}That's all.{\r}

164
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:34,363
-隊長，可以開始了嗎？  -該往哪裡走？
{\fs12}-Captain, can we start now?
-Mind telling me where we're going?{\r}

165
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:35,823
由此往東48英里
{\fs12}48 miles due east from here.{\r}

166
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:39,287
你的消息說飛機墜毀了，我們要去找嗎？
{\fs12}Your message said an airplane crashed.
Is that what we're looking for?{\r}

167
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:40,455
我不知道，隊長
{\fs12}I don't know, captain.{\r}

168
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:42,584
-你最好解釋一下      -對不起
{\fs12}-I think you better explain.    -I'm sorry.{\r}

169
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:45,504
尼克森小姐，能宣讀我的第一次筆記嗎？
{\fs12}Miss Nicholson, would you read Capt. Hendry my first notes?{\r}

170
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:50,136
我才在想我的信息含糊不清，我不喜歡含糊
{\fs12}I was thinking only of the vagueness of my information. I dislike being vague.{\r}

171
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:52,055
-"11月1日...         -昨天
{\fs12}-"November 1st...    -Yesterday.{\r}

172
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:57,271
...下午6:15探聲器和地震儀顯示東方有爆炸
{\fs12}...6:15 p.m. Sound detectors and seismographs registered explosion due east.{\r}

173
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:01,444
在6點18分，磁力計顯示向東偏離12度20分"
{\fs12}At 6:18, magnetometer revealed deviation 12 degrees, 20 minutes east."{\r}

174
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:04,865
-偏差一直恆定   -我們到達之前也遇上了
{\fs12}-That deviation has been constant.
-We ran into it before we got here.{\r}

175
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,953
“這種偏差只有一種可能：干擾力要相當於...
{\fs12}"Such deviation possible only if a disturbing force equivalent...{\r}

176
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,540
...兩萬噸的鋼鐵或鐵礦石...   -兩萬噸？
{\fs12}...to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore...
-20,000 tons?{\r}

177
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,629
...已成為地球的一部分 約有半徑50英里"
{\fs12}...had become part of the earth at about a 50-mile radius."{\r}

178
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:17,383
我有點無法理解，但聽起來像一顆隕石
{\fs12}You're getting a bit beyond me, but it sounds like a meteor.{\r}

179
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,303
是的，很像。除了一件事
{\fs12}Yes, very much. Except for one thing.{\r}

180
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:23,100
-展示給亨德利隊長看    -是，先生
{\fs12}-Will, show it to Capt. Hendry.   -Yes, sir.{\r}

181
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:26,353
我們有一些特殊的望遠鏡相機
{\fs12}We have some special telescopic cameras.{\r}

182
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:29,566
用於放射性的顯像，兼具蓋革偵測器...
{\fs12}On the appearance of radioactivity, a Geiger counter trips the release...{\r}

183
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:31,402
...和相機功能
{\fs12}...and the cameras function.{\r}

184
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,032
他們昨晚進行了，結果在這裡
{\fs12}They were working last evening. This is the result.{\r}

185
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:41,416
第一張照片是在爆炸前三分鐘拍攝的...
{\fs12}This first picture was taken three minutes before the explosion...{\r}

186
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:42,668
...或是說6點12分
{\fs12}...or 6:12.{\r}

187
00:13:42,837 --> 00:13:45,756
你可以看到下方角落的小點
{\fs12}You can see the small dot below there in the corner.{\r}

188
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:50,887
而下一張照片，一分鐘後，那個點由西往東移動...
{\fs12}On the next picture, one minute later,
that dot is moving from west to east...{\r}

189
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:53,851
...快得能形成一條線   -快門是多少？
{\fs12}...fast enough to form a streak.   -What shutter speed is it?{\r}

190
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,064
-千分之一秒     -相當快，對吧？
{\fs12}-1000th of a second.   -Moving pretty fast. Wasn't it?{\r}

191
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:01,111
這裡，在6點14分，它向上移動
{\fs12}Here, at 6:14, it's moving upward.{\r}

192
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:06,411
6:15，掉落地面消失了
{\fs12}6:15, it drops to the earth and vanishes.{\r}

193
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,750
流星能近乎水平向地球移動，但從不向上
{\fs12}A meteor might move almost horizontal to the earth but never upward.{\r}

194
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,795
-那就不是流星      -很明顯不是
{\fs12}-Then it isn't a meteor.   -That's obvious.{\r}

195
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,796
你怎麼發現撞擊的距離？
{\fs12}How'd you find the distance of impact?{\r}

196
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:16,884
-通過計算...       -卡林頓博士？
{\fs12}-By computation...    -Dr. Carrington?{\r}

197
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:19,262
-好了嗎？      -隊長，很簡單
{\fs12}-Ready?    -It's quite simple, captain.{\r}

198
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,017
我們有聲波到達的時間和探測器
{\fs12}We have the time of arrival of the sound waves and detectors.{\r}

199
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,647
還有地震儀上衝擊波的到達時間
{\fs12}And also the arrival time of the impact waves on the seismograph.{\r}

200
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,321
計算時間差，是那個物體造成得沒錯
{\fs12}By computing the difference, it becomes obvious they were caused by the object.{\r}

201
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:34,784
-距離這裡48英里    -就依你說的
{\fs12}-The distance from here is 48 miles.
-I'll take your word for it.{\r}

202
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:38,999
有一點，2萬噸鋼對飛機來說分量不輕啊
{\fs12}One thing, doctor. 20,000 tons of steel is a lot of metal for an airplane.{\r}

203
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,294
這是對我們所了解的那種飛機而言，隊長
{\fs12}It is for the sort of airplane we know, captain.{\r}

204
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,551
-我們該走了  -雷丁會每隔一刻檢查一次
{\fs12}-Yeah, we'd better be going.
-Redding will check every quarter-hour.{\r}

205
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:49,471
-博士，需要我嗎？    -沒這必要
{\fs12}-Will you want me, doctor?   -It won't be necessary.{\r}

206
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,517
比爾，你和我們走      -是，博士
{\fs12}-You come with us, Bill.    -Yes, doctor.{\r}

207
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,315
帕特，我們很快就會到
{\fs12}We'll be there pretty soon now, Pat.{\r}

208
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:12,404
鮑伯，叫卡林頓來這裡。
{\fs12}Bob, get Carrington up here.{\r}

209
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,531
博士！
{\fs12}Doctor!{\r}

210
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,083
博士，差不多在50英里之外了
{\fs12}We're almost 50 miles out, doctor.{\r}

211
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:25,046
羅盤有偏差，你要如何導航，隊長？
{\fs12}With your compass deviation, how are you navigating, captain?{\r}

212
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:27,508
前面的山峰實際上是正東方向
{\fs12}That peak ahead is practically due east.{\r}

213
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,468
在離開營地之前，我們抓到了氣流*
{\fs12}We got the wind before we left camp.{\r}

214
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,514
-非常好，隊長   -現在應該到達了，帕特
{\fs12}-Very good, captain.   -We should be there about now, Pat.{\r}

215
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:37,230
十。九。八。七。六。
{\fs12}Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.{\r}

216
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:39,817
長官，蓋革偵測器有讀數了
{\fs12}Picking up something on the Geiger counter, sir.{\r}

217
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:44,198
五。四。三。二。一。
{\fs12}Five. Four. Three. Two. One.{\r}

218
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:45,700
看這裡
{\fs12}Look there.{\r}

219
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,877
-帕特，羅盤亂轉   -蓋革偵測器破表
{\fs12}-Pat, the compass is in a spin.   -Geiger's up to the top.{\r}

220
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,842
是的，就是這樣，沒錯
{\fs12}Yeah, that's it, all right.{\r}

221
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,226
-有降落點嗎？   -後方半英里似乎平滑
{\fs12}-You see someplace to set down?
-Looked smooth about a half a mile back.{\r}

222
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:06,855
我們瞧瞧。鮑伯！叫大家預備，可能很顛簸
{\fs12}We'll take a look. Bob! Get them ready. It might be rough.{\r}

223
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:08,273
好，長官
{\fs12}Right, sir.{\r}

224
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:11,070
大家繫好安全帶，要降落了
{\fs12}Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen. We're gonna land.{\r}

225
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,573
後面的坐下來抓牢
{\fs12}Sit down and hold on back there.{\r}

226
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,957
長官，準備著陸就緒
{\fs12}All set for landing, sir.{\r}

227
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,552
半襟翼
{\fs12}Half flaps.{\r}

228
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:32,015
-全富油        -全富油*
{\fs12}-Full rich.     -Full rich.{\r}

229
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,226
半襟翼
{\fs12}Half flaps.{\r}

230
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,423
我們到了
{\fs12}There we are.{\r}

231
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:27,261
老天！好怪異的景象
{\fs12}Holy cat! What a weird-Iooking thing.{\r}

232
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:30,014
在你們佈滿足跡之前 先讓我拍照
{\fs12}Let me get a picture before you track up the whole place.{\r}

233
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:31,808
這個蓋革偵測器瘋了
{\fs12}This Geiger counter is going crazy.{\r}

234
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:35,355
有東西溶解了外殼，又被透明的冰凍結了
{\fs12}Something's melted that surface crust.
It's frozen over again into clear ice.{\r}

235
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,818
顯然是飛行體第一次在瓶頸處撞擊地球時...
{\fs12}The bottle shape apparently was caused by the craft first making contact...{\r}

236
00:17:39,028 --> 00:17:40,988
...而形成這個瓶子的造型...
{\fs12}...with the earth out at the neck of the bottle...{\r}

237
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:44,660
...向我方滑動，在停止之前形成較大的區域
{\fs12}...sliding toward us and forming that larger area as it came to rest.{\r}

238
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,501
發動機產生足夠的熱量 融化滑動路徑的冰...
{\fs12}With the engines generating enough heat to melt that path through the crust...{\r}

239
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,129
...然後沉入冰層下  -怎麼融化那麼多冰？
{\fs12}...then sink beneath the surface.
-What could melt that much ice?{\r}

240
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,175
我們下去看看...巴恩斯
{\fs12}Let's go down and see. Barnes.{\r}

241
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,847
把狗帶去那邊
{\fs12}Take the dogs over on that side.{\r}

242
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:11,215
查普曼博士，飛機能融化那麼多冰嗎？
{\fs12}Dr. Chapman, could an airplane melt that much ice?{\r}

243
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,928
我們的一架噴射飛機產生的熱量
足以提供50層的辦公大樓的熱氣
{\fs12}One of our own jets generates enough heat to warm a 50-story office building.{\r}

244
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:30,743
-這是機舵的一部分，可能是水平尾翼
-這是一架飛機沒錯
{\fs12}-It's part of an airfoil. Probably a stabilizer.
-It's an airplane, all right.{\r}

245
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,538
-說得出這是什麼金屬嗎？  -我需要一些工具
{\fs12}-Can you tell what metal that is?   -I'll need some tools.{\r}

246
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:36,001
巴恩斯，帶一些工具來！
{\fs12}Barnes, bring some tools!{\r}

247
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:43,595
嘿，下沉的很深。烏黑黑的看不出是啥東西
{\fs12}Hey, it's down pretty deep over here.
I can't see anything but a dark mass.{\r}

248
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:44,928
這裡更深
{\fs12}It's deeper over here.{\r}

249
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:49,394
隊長，我們散開來丈量尺寸和確定形狀
{\fs12}Captain, may I suggest that we spread out and try to determine the size and shape.{\r}

250
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:53,859
好，大家散開！想辦法找出這東西的形狀
{\fs12}Right. Spread out, everybody!
We're gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.{\r}

251
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:55,986
長官，工具來了
{\fs12}Here's the tools, sir.{\r}

252
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,425
老天！
{\fs12}Holy cat!{\r}

253
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:14,011
嘿...
{\fs12}Hey...{\r}

254
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:16,891
這幾乎是...
{\fs12}It's almost...{\r}

255
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,270
是啊。幾乎是正...
{\fs12}Yeah. Almost a perfect...{\r}

256
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,484
是的。是正圓型
{\fs12}It is. It's round.{\r}

257
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,740
-終於碰到了一個    -我們發現一個飛碟！
{\fs12}-We finally got one.   -We found a flying saucer!{\r}

258
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:30,244
有誰能透過冰層看到東西嗎？
{\fs12}Can anybody see anything through the ice?{\r}

259
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,705
-只有大概的形狀    -只是黑壓壓一團
{\fs12}-Only an outline.   -Nothing but a dark shape.{\r}

260
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,167
看起來相當平滑，沒有門窗
{\fs12}Seems perfectly smooth. No doors or windows.{\r}

261
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:38,672
-我沒看到引擎   -我懷疑能找出所謂的引擎
{\fs12}-I can't see any engine.
-I doubt we find anything we call an engine.{\r}

262
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,594
卡林頓博士，這不是我所熟知的金屬
{\fs12}Dr. Carrington, this isn't any metal I know.{\r}

263
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:44,596
可能是一些新合金
{\fs12}Probably some new alloy.{\r}

264
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:48,018
-取一些樣品進行分析       -對
{\fs12}-Get some filings for analysis.   -Right.{\r}

265
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:52,359
隊長，我不認為我們能用斧頭來破冰
{\fs12}Captain, I don't think we have a chance of chopping through the ice with axes.{\r}

266
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,529
我們有同感。我們將嘗試用鋁熱炸彈來熔冰
{\fs12}I know. We think so too.
We'll try to melt it out with thermite bombs.{\r}

267
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:57,866
-哦，非常好    -你認為它來自哪裡？
{\fs12}-Oh, excellent.   -Where do you figure it's from?{\r}

268
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,243
史考特先生，我不知道
{\fs12}I don't know, Mr. Scott.{\r}

269
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,077
-來自本星球？    -我對此表示懷疑
{\fs12}-Well, from this planet?   -I doubt it.{\r}

270
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:03,957
-那你呢...？      -答案要等...
{\fs12}-Well, do you...?   -The answers will be much easier...{\r}

271
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,879
...我們檢查了飛機的內部...
{\fs12}...after we've examined the interior of the aircraft...{\r}

272
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:10,969
...及其主人，如果還在的話   -主人？我從不...
{\fs12}...and its occupants, if there are any.
-Occupants? Why, I never...{\r}

273
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:13,138
大新聞！哪裡有無線電？嘿，巴恩斯！
{\fs12}What a story! Where's the radio? Hey, Barnes!{\r}

274
00:20:13,806 --> 00:20:16,433
-等等，不准私人通信     -"私人"是啥意思？
{\fs12}-Hold it. No private messages.   -What do you mean private?{\r}

275
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,603
-我要向全世界發送    -這屬於空軍的消息
{\fs12}-I'm sending it to the whole world.
-This is Air Force information.{\r}

276
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:21,649
等授權下來，你才能發
{\fs12}We'll have to wait for authority to let you file it.{\r}

277
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:26,197
憲法已經授權給你了！這叫做新聞自由
{\fs12}You got your authority in the Constitution!
It's called freedom of the press.{\r}

278
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:28,284
-我要發送一則新聞！  -不能用我們的船
{\fs12}-I'm sending a story!    -Not from our ship.{\r}

279
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:30,745
-炸彈要擺哪裡？   -一個放在水平尾翼...
{\fs12}-Where do you want the bombs?  -One by the stabilizer...{\r}

280
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:33,332
如果有需要的話，另一個放在另一邊
{\fs12}...another over in the far side if we need it.{\r}

281
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,003
這是紅海分離以來最大的事件，你隱藏不了的！
{\fs12}It's the biggest story since the parting of the Red Sea. You can't hide it!{\r}

282
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,716
-想想這對世界意義重大   -我不是替世界工作
{\fs12}-Think what it means to the world.
-I don't work for the world.{\r}

283
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:41,593
-看...     -不，史考特。我來拿
{\fs12}-Look...   -No, Scott. I'll take that.{\r}

284
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:44,974
-這是信管      -回去船上，呼叫營地
{\fs12}-Here's the detonator.
-Get back to the ship and call the camp.{\r}

285
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:50,398
要特克斯發信，我們在冰上發現了一個飛碟
正試著取出來
{\fs12}Have Tex radio we've found a flying saucer in the ice.
We're gonna try to get it out.{\r}

286
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:53,151
-那我呢？    -也問問史考特能否發送新聞
{\fs12}-What about me?   -Also, ask if Scott can send his story.{\r}

287
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,740
-只能幫到這    -你會升官變另一個福格蒂
{\fs12}-That's all I can do.
-You're gonna grow up to be another Fogarty.{\r}

288
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:58,743
-要在哪兒引爆？      -在那邊
{\fs12}-Where we gonna touch this off?   -Over there.{\r}

289
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,413
看到西邊了嗎？那鋒面快速移動...
{\fs12}Have you looked to the west? That front's moving fast...{\r}

290
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:05,669
...氣溫也在下降     -我們只剩不到一小時
{\fs12}...and the temperature's dropping too.
-We don't have more than an hour.{\r}

291
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,966
鮑伯，那些你放哪裡？    -表面正上方
{\fs12}-Where do you put those, Bob?   -Right on the surface.{\r}

292
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,177
-告訴史東，好嗎長官？     -好
{\fs12}-Tell Stone. Will you, sir?    -Right.{\r}

293
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:14,223
嘿，鋁熱彈有什麼用途？
{\fs12}Say, what will this thermite do?{\r}

294
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:17,394
這是S-O-P，用於融冰的標準操作程序
{\fs12}This is S-O-P, standard operating procedure for removing ice.{\r}

295
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:20,273
勾住這根電線，好嗎中尉？只是用來融冰
{\fs12}Hook this wire up, will you, lieutenant? It just melts it.{\r}

296
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,318
作用的速度有多快？
{\fs12}How fast does it work?{\r}

297
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:25,030
在30秒內除掉飛碟上方的冰層
{\fs12}It'll uncover the whole saucer in 30 seconds.{\r}

298
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,158
-這裡準備好了！     -馬上過去！
{\fs12}-All ready over here!   -Be right with you!{\r}

299
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:32,582
最好清場！直到靠近狗橇附近！一分鐘後會變得很熱
{\fs12}Better clear the field! Over near the dog sled!.
Gonna get pretty hot here in a minute.{\r}

300
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:50,650
勾起來，先試試尾翼 有需要再使用另一個
{\fs12}Hook her up. We'll try the stabilizer first.
Use the other one if we need it.{\r}

301
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:53,862
現在起幾分鐘後，就可能擁有星空之鑰
{\fs12}A few minutes from now we may have the key to the stars.{\r}

302
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:57,158
一百萬年的歷史正在冰下等待著我們
{\fs12}A million years of history are waiting for us in that ice.{\r}

303
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:59,705
-通知一聲，我想拍張照  -長官，就緒了
{\fs12}-Say when. I wanna get a picture.   -All ready, sir.{\r}

304
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,457
-這裡就緒了        -引爆吧，鮑伯
{\fs12}-Ready here.    -Let her go, Bob.{\r}

305
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:14,558
-好，清場完畢     -等一下，大家後退
{\fs12}-Okay, all clear.   -Wait a minute, everybody. Stay back.{\r}

306
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,565
-它在冰下燃燒       -小心，隊長
{\fs12}-It's burning under the ice.   -Careful, captain.{\r}

307
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,364
發生什麼事？
{\fs12}What's happening?{\r}

308
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:25,990
告訴我，博士
{\fs12}Tell me, doctor.{\r}

309
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,412
大家趴下！
{\fs12}Get down on the ground, everybody!{\r}

310
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,733
大家都好嗎？
{\fs12}Everybody all right?{\r}

311
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,195
最後一次爆炸是發動機
{\fs12}That last explosion was the engine.{\r}

312
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,740
士官，試一試蓋革計數器好嗎？
{\fs12}Sergeant, will you try your Geiger counter?{\r}

313
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,621
-只有一格         -只是殘留物
{\fs12}-Only a trace.   -That's just residual.{\r}

314
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:00,706
全都完了
{\fs12}It's all gone.{\r}

315
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,336
可能給我們帶來新科學的秘密
{\fs12}Secrets that might have given us a new science.{\r}

316
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:05,923
-完了       -中看不重用
{\fs12}-Gone.     -That's just dandy.{\r}

317

{\fs12}Yeah! He must be over 8 feet long.{\r}

331
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:05,215

{\fs12}-Somebody got out of that saucer.   -Or was thrown out.{\r}

332
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:08,260

-大家分勞      -是的，長官
{\fs12}-It's hands off for everyone.   -Yes, sir.{\r}

392
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:27,921
-夠暖嗎？   -如果沒有，就會聽到我尖叫
{\fs12}-Gonna be warm enough?   -If not, you'll hear me squawk.{\r}

393
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:30,840
-鮑伯會送晚餐來    -我可以找些東西來閱讀
{\fs12}-Bob will bring you dinner.   -I could use something to read.{\r}

394
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:36,349
-一個美好，安靜的恐怖故事  -對你來說可能太平淡了
{\fs12}-A nice, quiet horror story.   -Might be kind of tame for you, sir.{\r}

395

{\fs12}-Excuse me, doctor. May I?    -Certainly.{\r}

397
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:46,906
關於將身體從冰上移出，我想指出...
{\fs12}In relation to removing the body from the ice, I'd like to point out...{\r}

398
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:50,912
...有些生物在死後會復生，但寒冷會摧毀它們
{\fs12}...there are organisms that survive after death, but cold can destroy them.{\r}

399
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,622
-有鑑於此...        -我不知道...
{\fs12}-In view of that...    -I don't know...{\r}

400
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,921
但這些生物很危險，可能攜帶著外星細菌
{\fs12}But these organisms may be dangerous.
They may be carrying germs from another planet.{\r}

401
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,216
-那些無法以醫藥對付的細菌   -謝謝
{\fs12}-Germs we couldn't cope with medically.   -Thank you.{\r}

402
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:02,679
-查普曼博士，我無法認同  -我也不同意
{\fs12}-I can't agree with you, Dr. Chapman.   -I don't either.{\r}

另一個是：未知這個生物的遺骸會對...
{\fs12}Here's another: We don't know what effect the air of our Earth...{\r}

404
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:10,273
...我們的大氣有何影響  -像飛碟一樣化成輕煙？
{\fs12}...may have on this creature's remains.
-Sort of go up in smoke, like the saucer?{\r}

405
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,190
-胡說            -這不會太牽強嗎？
{\fs12}-Nonsense.     -Isn't that far-fetched?{\r}

406
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,029
-火星人就是如此    -這不會有結論的
{\fs12}-So is a man from Mars.   -We're getting nowhere.{\r}

407
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:19,161
我建議亨德利隊長立刻與他的上級溝通
{\fs12}I suggest that Capt. Hendry communicate with his superior at once.{\r}

408
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:22,122
我老糊塗了。我們應該完成那第一件事
{\fs12}I'm getting senile. We should have done that first thing.{\r}

409
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:27,297
隊長，我很驚訝你在返程時沒試著聯絡將軍
{\fs12}I'm surprised, captain, that you didn't try to reach your general on our way back here.{\r}

410
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:28,714
我們有啊。巴恩斯
{\fs12}We did. Barnes.{\r}

411
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:32,721
我請你的無線電員轉達，接不通，太多干擾
{\fs12}I tried through your radio operator.
Couldn't get through. Too much interference.{\r}

412
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:36,267
-了解了，我道歉，隊長    -沒事的，博士
{\fs12}-I see. My apologies, captain.   -Yes, doctor.{\r}

{\fs12}-Hi, captain.     -Hi, Tex.{\r}

414
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:41,358
你肯定惹了很多麻煩...
{\fs12}You sure stirred up a lot of trouble...{\r}

415
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:43,695
-我的信息發出了嗎？     -確定
{\fs12}-Did you send out my message?    -Sure did.{\r}

416
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:46,531
-有回復嗎？   -一小時前，能讀一下嗎？
{\fs12}-Get an answer back?
-This came an hour ago. Can you read it?{\r}

417
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,868
不，還是你來     -"福格蒂致亨德利：

-你鋁熱彈的意外解套了...  -別這樣，繼續
{\fs12}-That lets you off the hook for the thermite...
-Take it easy. Go ahead.{\r}

423
00:30:08,564 --> 00:30:12,695
"在我抵達前，建立臨時結構以保護飛行物"
{\fs12}"Erect temporary structure to protect aircraft until my arrival."{\r}

424
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:15,989
這是另一則。幾分鐘前，只得到一部分
{\fs12}Here's another one. Came a few minutes ago. Could only get part of it.{\r}

425
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,453
-繼續      -"全部停飛，不能..."
{\fs12}-Go ahead.   -"Everything grounded. Can't..." Something.{\r}

426
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,499
-"要你..."某些事...   -聽起來像福格蒂
{\fs12}-"Want you..." Something or other...
-That sounds like Fogarty.{\r}

427
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,837
-然後斷線了      -什麼都沒得到？
{\fs12}-Then it got fouled up.   -You're getting nothing?{\r}

428
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:27,966
沒有，被靜電波蓋掉了
{\fs12}Nothing. Static's knocking it right out of the air.{\r}

429
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:31,219
-你的東西呢？  -不知他們拿到了沒，我懷疑
{\fs12}-What about your stuff?
-Don't know if they're getting it. I doubt it.{\r}

430
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:33,515
我不信，連「小馬快遞」都能通過
{\fs12}I don't believe it. Even the Pony Express got through.{\r}

431
00:30:33,683 --> 00:30:35,852
-博士？       -鑑於此種新情況...
{\fs12}-Well, doctor?   -In view of this new situation...{\r}

432
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,272
-舊規則沒變        -我們無法認同
{\fs12}-Doesn't alter the old one.   -We disagree with you.{\r}

433
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,192
-沒有理由拖延...   -各位抱歉了，就這樣
{\fs12}-There's no reason to delay...   -Sorry, gentlemen. That's it.{\r}

434
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,696
特克斯，我要巴恩斯留下來盡力幫忙
{\fs12}Tex, I'd like to leave Barnes to help out all he can.{\r}

435
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,782
-當然         -巴恩斯，繼續努力搶通
{\fs12}-Sure.    -Barnes, keep trying to get through.{\r}

436
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:47,617
我想向將軍發射一個信息
{\fs12}I wanna get a message to the general.{\r}

437
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:51,290
告訴他飛行物已被鋁熱彈徹底摧毀了
{\fs12}Tell him the aircraft was completely destroyed by the thermite bomb.{\r}

438
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:54,169
-告訴他發現一名乘客...   -火星來的？在哪裡？
{\fs12}-Tell him we found a passenger...
-A fellow from Mars? Where?{\r}

439
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:55,462
在冰上，哥們
{\fs12}On ice, buddy.{\r}

440
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:58,467
告訴他屍體在冰塊裡，卡林頓博士請求...
{\fs12}Tell him the body's in ice and Dr. Carrington wants permission...{\r}

441
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,971
...從冰裡取下屍體進行查驗
{\fs12}...to remove the body from the ice for examination.{\r}

442
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,807
在進一步行動之前，我們會靜待指示
{\fs12}We're standing by for instructions before further action.{\r}

443
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:05,018
是，長官
{\fs12}Yes, sir.{\r}

444
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:08,356
-要補充嗎，博士？   -有個非常基本的觀點
{\fs12}-You got anything to add, doctor?
-Yes, one very essential point.{\r}

445
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:11,276
我認為進行檢驗非常重要
{\fs12}That I concider it vitally important that the examination be made.{\r}

446
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:13,530
-務必要做，是啊    -加上那個，巴恩斯
{\fs12}-By all means. Yeah.    -Add that, Barnes.{\r}

447
00:31:13,698 --> 00:31:16,451
謝謝你，隊長。我只關心這個
{\fs12}Thank you, captain. That's all that concerns me.{\r}

448
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,080
李察，一有回應，希望你讓我知道
{\fs12}Richard when you get your answer, I expect you to let me know.{\r}

449
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:20,915
是的，博士
{\fs12}Yes, doctor.{\r}

450
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,384
我會去採訪博士對你評價，等著瞧吧
{\fs12}Wait till I interview the doctor about what he thinks of you.{\r}

451
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,928
-可能印象不錯吧   -如果不是，我會留情
{\fs12}-Probably pretty good.   -If it isn't, I'll make it good.{\r}

452
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:34,309
特克斯，繼續努力
巴恩斯，如果接通，順便問史考特先生的事
{\fs12}Tex, keep trying. Barnes, if he gets through,
ask the general again about clearing Mr. Scott.{\r}

453
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:37,105
別想討好我，我不會更喜歡你
{\fs12}Don't try to soft-soap me. I don't like you any better.{\r}

454
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,359
艾迪，我陪你吃飯    -我會拿一些吃的
{\fs12}-I'll eat with you, Eddie.   -I'll send you some chow.{\r}

455
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:44,949
什麼事，鮑伯？
{\fs12}What is it, Bob?{\r}

456
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:50,082
就是麥克弗森中尉看守冰塊裡的那傢伙
{\fs12}It's about Lt. McPherson sitting in there with that thing in the block of ice.{\r}

457
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:51,791
變得很緊張？
{\fs12}Getting nervous?{\r}

458
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,631
他不要我告訴你，長官，但他心慌意亂
{\fs12}Well, he wouldn't want me to tell you, sir, but he's having kittens.{\r}

459
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:58,135
雷興堡之役以後，沒聽過他會這樣尖叫
{\fs12}I haven't heard him squawk like this since Rechenberg.{\r}

460
00:31:58,304 --> 00:31:59,304
真的？
{\fs12}Really?{\r}

461
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:03,434
長官，冰塊逐漸透明，那東西清晰可見
{\fs12}You see, sir, the ice is clearing up,
and we can see that thing pretty good now.{\r}

462
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:07,650
瘋狂的手，光頭，還有眼睛...
{\fs12}It's got crazy hands and no hair, and the eyes...{\r}

463
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:11,655
-是張開的，好像可以看到你  -鮑伯，我沒聽過你...
{\fs12}-They're open and look like they can see.
-Bob, I haven't heard you...{\r}

464
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:14,700
長官，也嚇到我了，我沒在那裡待太久
{\fs12}It's got me too, sir, and I wasn't in there very long.{\r}

465
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:19,875
-此外相當冷。我給了中尉電熱毯  -好
{\fs12}Besides that, it's pretty cold. I got the lieutenant an electric blanket.
-Good{\r}

466
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:22,670
-隊長，我有個建議      -說吧
{\fs12}-Captain, I got a suggestion.   -Go ahead.{\r}

467
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,758
不要四小時輪班，可以再減一半...
{\fs12}Instead of four-hour shifts, we could cut them in half...{\r}

468
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:29,846
好，你叫巴恩斯2200去接替
{\fs12}Okay. You tell Barnes to take over at 2200.{\r}

469
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:33,060
你接管2400，我會在0200去接替你
{\fs12}You take over at 2400, and I'll relieve you at 0200.{\r}

470
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,522
-我想你是對的，長官    -我認為你是
{\fs12}-I think you're right, sir.   -I think you are.{\r}

471
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,525
謝謝你，長官
{\fs12}Thank you, sir.{\r}

472
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:44,076
帕特，巴恩斯剛來過，真高興不用再看那東西了
{\fs12}Hi, Pat. Barnes just got here.
Sure glad I'm not looking at that guy anymore.{\r}

473
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:45,660
-全弄好了，巴恩斯？   -是，長官
{\fs12}-All set, Barnes?   -Yes, sir.{\r}

474
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:49,959
-帶件電子飛行服和咖啡   -鮑伯2400來接替
{\fs12}-Got an electric flying suit and coffee.
-Bob will relieve you at 2400.{\r}

475
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:53,212
-別緊張        -是啊
{\fs12}-Take it easy.       -Yeah.{\r}

476
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:36,441
好多了
{\fs12}That's better.{\r}

477
00:34:33,147 --> 00:34:36,275
亨德利隊長！亨德利隊長！亨德利隊長
{\fs12}Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry.{\r}

478
00:34:36,444 --> 00:34:38,278
什麼事，下士？
{\fs12}What's the matter, corporal?{\r}

479
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:42,285
隊長呢？我得告訴他那東西還活著。我看到了
{\fs12}Where's the captain?
I've got to tell him that thing's alive. I saw it.{\r}

480
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:44,829
它追我。它沒死。它...
{\fs12}It chased me. It's not dead. It's...{\r}

481
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,624
亨德利隊長！
{\fs12}Capt. Hendry!{\r}

482
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:51,005
長官，那東西還活著。我開槍打中了它
{\fs12}That thing's alive, sir. I saw it. I shot at it. I hit it, I know it.{\r}

483
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:55,345
但沒有用，它一直逼近我，還發出喵喵叫聲音
{\fs12}Nothing happened. It kept coming at me, making a noise like a cat meowing.{\r}

484
00:34:55,512 --> 00:35:00,852
如果你看見那雙手和那雙眼睛！你必須採取...
{\fs12}If you could have seen those hands and those eyes! You've got to do something...{\r}

485
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:06,778
麥克，鮑伯，去拿槍來。巴恩斯，發生了什麼？
{\fs12}Mac, Bob, get some guns. Now, Barnes, what happened?{\r}

486
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:11,784
對不起，不是很清楚 但突然活過來，並逼近我
{\fs12}I'm sorry, sir. I don't know exactly, but all of a sudden it was alive and coming at me.{\r}

487
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:15,414
我開槍擊中它，一點也沒用，所以我跑了...
{\fs12}I shot at it and hit it. Nothing happened, so I ran...{\r}

488
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:16,916
-慢慢來            -對不起，長官
{\fs12}-Easy, easy.       -I'm sorry, sir.{\r}

489
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:20,672
-槍，隊長        -好好照顧他好嗎？
{\fs12}-Here, captain.   -Take care of him. Will you?{\r}

490
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,803
回去睡覺
{\fs12}Get back to sleep.{\r}

491
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,479
跟其他人一起後退
{\fs12}Get back with the rest of them.{\r}

492
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:50,797
-是什麼...？   -奇德說他還活著。我相信
{\fs12}-What could've...?   -Kid said he was alive. I believe him.{\r}

493
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:53,719
我就知道。在那裡時，我都能感受到
{\fs12}I knew it. All the time I was here, I could feel it.{\r}

494
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:58,183
原來是這樣，電毯是開著的。還是溫的
{\fs12}Here's what did it. This blanket was on. It's still warm.{\r}

495
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:06,611
-他走了沒錯   -去拿皮大衣，靴子和手電筒！
{\fs12}-He got out of here, all right.
-Get parkas, boots and a flashlight!{\r}

496
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:10,534
-聽，狗狗會把他撕成碎片  -我們必須救他
{\fs12}-Listen. They'll tear him to pieces.   -We must save him.{\r}

497
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:14,790
慢著，博士。五分鐘內凍死你，動動腦子！
{\fs12}Hold it, doctor. You'll freeze to death in five minutes. Use your head!{\r}

498
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:17,379
-希望你是對的，我緊張過度了
{\fs12}-I expect you're right. I was overanxious.

499
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:19,379
從這裡看，隊長！
{\fs12}Look over here, captain!{\r}

500
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,851
-你們的東西應該都拿來了
{\fs12}-I think I've got yours.{\r}

501
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:28,951
可以給我一個嗎，隊長？
{\fs12}May I have one, captain?{\r}

502
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,478
博士，還是我們去吧
{\fs12}Better let us go, doctor.{\r}

503
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,903
-醫生，能看到什麼嗎？    -不多
{\fs12}-Doc, can you see anything out there?   -Not much.{\r}

504
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:41,910
-都準備好了嗎？      -開門
{\fs12}-You all set?     -Let her go.{\r}

505
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,092
隊長，如果你們任何人能描述
你在外頭看到的東西，會大有幫助
{\fs12}Captain, it would help if you, any of you,
would describe what you saw out there.{\r}

506
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:53,220
太冷了看的不清楚，但狗把他撲倒了
{\fs12}It was too cold to see well, but the dogs had him down.{\r}

507
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,892
-站來時三隻狗掛在臂上   -他甩掉一隻
{\fs12}-He got up with three hanging on his arm.
-He threw one at the rest.{\r}

508
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,688
-兩隻死了    -看起來像被絞肉機絞過
{\fs12}-Two were dead.   -Looked like they'd been through a chopper.{\r}

509
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:02,775
-在哪裡找到手臂？    -一部分被狗壓住
{\fs12}-Where did you find the arm?   -Partly under one of them.{\r}

510
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:05,905
狗可以撕下一隻胳膊嗎？
{\fs12}Could dogs tear off an arm?{\r}

511
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:08,741
這種手臂
{\fs12}This kind of an arm.{\r}

512
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:13,416
-小心，倒鉤很鋒利   -似乎是某種角質體
{\fs12}-Be careful, doctor. Those barbs are sharp.
-Seems to be a sort of chitinous substance.{\r}

513
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,583
別掉文
{\fs12}Speak English.{\r}

514
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,713
介於甲蟲的背殼和玫瑰刺之間的東西
{\fs12}Something between a beetle's back and a rose thorn.{\r}

515
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:19,549
-長刺的手指？       -強壯異常
{\fs12}-Thorn-fingered?    -Amazingly strong.{\r}

516
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:21,594
-非常有效的武器         -非常
{\fs12}-Very effective as a weapon.   -Very.{\r}

517
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:26,058
用不著憂心，斷了一臂又那麼冷，他活不了
{\fs12}We don't have to worry about that.
An arm off and out in that cold, he's dead now.{\r}

518
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:28,687
在一大塊冰裡待了24小時而安然無恙
{\fs12}Got along fine in a block of ice for 24 hours.{\r}

519
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:32,233
-12隻狗攻擊他，身手真敏捷  -失去了一臂
{\fs12}-Pretty spry for a guy with 12 dogs on him.
-And for losing an arm.{\r}

520
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,446
-我卻失去了理智      -很驚人，不是嗎？
{\fs12}-I'm losing my mind.   -Amazing, isn't it?{\r}

521
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:38,543
-驚人的強壯           -怪異
{\fs12}-Amazingly strong.    -Strange.{\r}

522
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,305
-我敢肯定     -手上有鮮血，不是嗎？
{\fs12}-I'm sure of it.   -That is blood on the hand. Isn't it?{\r}

523
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,059
-對，但不是他的       -可能是狗血
{\fs12}-Yes, but not his.   -Probably from one of the dogs.{\r}

524
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:49,066
手臂上沒血，也沒有動物組織
{\fs12}There's no blood in the arm, no animal tissue.{\r}

525
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:53,905
史登博士，能在顯微鏡下看一下嗎？
{\fs12}Dr. Stern, would you have a look at this under the microscope?{\r}

526
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,082
不，史考特先生。我很懷疑它是否會死...
就是我們所理解的死亡
{\fs12}No, Mr. Scott. I doubt very much if it can die, as we understand dying.{\r}

527
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,545
-老天！            -是
{\fs12}-Holy cat!      -Yes.{\r}

528
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:06,213
博士，那麼？
{\fs12}Well, doctor?{\r}

529
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:12,723
沒有顯示動脈結構，看不到神經末梢
{\fs12}No arterial structure indicated. No nerve endings visible.{\r}

530
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,539
多孔的，支離破碎的細胞生長
{\fs12}Porous, unconnected cellular growth.{\r}

531
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:23,088
等等，博士。你好像在描述一種蔬菜
{\fs12}Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like you're trying to describe a vegetable.{\r}

532
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:26,760
-就是啊，你都了解了嗎？   -哦，天啊！
{\fs12}-I am. Are you getting all of this?  -Oh, for Pete's sake!{\r}

533
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:32,018
博士，所以巴恩斯士官的子彈沒作用
{\fs12}You know, doctor, that could be why Sgt. Barnes' bullets had no effect.{\r}

534
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:35,147
-那就對了    -只在蔬菜上挖幾個洞罷了
{\fs12}-That's right.   -Merely holes drilled into vegetable matter.{\r}

535
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:37,276
這裡有綠色液體
{\fs12}This green fluid here.{\r}

536
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:40,279
-像植物汁液    -可能會發現裡面有糖基
{\fs12}-Like plant sap.   -We'll probably find it has a sugar base.{\r}

537
00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:42,867
拜託，博士，我得問這個問題
{\fs12}Please, doctor, I've got to ask this.{\r}

538
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:48,082
聽起來好像...是某種超級的胡蘿蔔
{\fs12}It sounds like, well... Just as though you're describing some form of super carrot.{\r}

539
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:51,253
史考特先生，幾乎可以這麼說
{\fs12}That's nearly right, Mr. Scott.{\r}

540
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:57,554
這胡蘿蔔 有能力建造飛行數百萬英里...
{\fs12}This carrot, as you call it, has constructed an aircraft capable of flying millions of miles...{\r}

541
00:39:57,764 --> 00:40:00,642
...以人類尚未知的能源推動的飛行物
{\fs12}...propelled by a force as yet unknown to us.{\r}

542
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:04,773
-高智能胡蘿蔔，心思難測    -不至於
{\fs12}-An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles.  -It shouldn't.{\r}

543
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:08,277
想像一下，在第三紀這會有多怪異...
{\fs12}Imagine how strange it would have seemed during the Pliocene age...{\r}

544
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:14,663
...能預測滿地爬蠕蟲，魚類，蜥蜴會進化成人類
{\fs12}...to forecast that worms, fish, lizards that crawled over the Earth would evolve into us.{\r}

545
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:16,498
我們訪客在他們的星球上演化出...
{\fs12}On the planet from which our visitor came...{\r}

546
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:20,838
...蔬菜形式，就如我們演化成動物形式...
{\fs12}...vegetable life underwent an evolution similar to that of our own animal life...{\r}

547
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:24,258
...這正可解釋其大腦的優越性
{\fs12}...which would account for the superiority of its brain.{\r}

548
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:29,266
它的發展不會受到情緒或性因素的影響
{\fs12}Its development was not handicapped by emotional or sexual factors.{\r}

549
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:32,395
卡林頓博士，你得過諾貝爾獎
{\fs12}Dr. Carrington, you won the Nobel Prize.{\r}

550
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,066
你已經囊括了科學家們所能獲得的各項榮譽
{\fs12}You've received every kind of kudos a scientist can attain.{\r}

551
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:39,946
如果你待價而沽，我能向外國政府籌資買下你
{\fs12}If you were for sale, I could get a million bucks for you from any foreign government.{\r}

552
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:44,245
我不會貿然地跳出來說你荒誕不經...
{\fs12}I'm not, therefore, gonna stick my neck out and say you're stuffed full...{\r}

553
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:48,919
...滿口胡言。但我保證，我的讀者會這麼認為
{\fs12}...of wild blueberry muffins. But I promise you, my readers are gonna think so.{\r}

554
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:54,259
快不會了。除非他們對自己星球的植物一無所知
{\fs12}Not for long, Mr. Scott. Not if they know anything about the flora of their own planet.{\r}

555
00:40:54,427 --> 00:40:58,139
你是說地球上有會思考的蔬菜嗎？
{\fs12}You mean there are vegetables right here on Earth that can think?{\r}

556
00:40:58,308 --> 00:41:02,771
某種思考方式，是的。聽過電報藤嗎？
{\fs12}A certain kind of thinking, yes.
You ever hear of the telegraph vine?{\r}

557
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:04,732
-最近沒有         -或者...
{\fs12}-Not recently.     -Or the...{\r}

558
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:08,279
-acanthus世紀的植物，史登博士？  -是
{\fs12}-Is it the acanthus century plant, Dr. Stern?   -Yes.{\r}

559
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,365
來吧，博士。那是你的領域
{\fs12}Go ahead, doctor. That's your field.{\r}

560
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:16,081
這植物捕食老鼠，蝙蝠，松鼠等小型哺乳動物
{\fs12}Well, the century plant catches mice, bats, squirrels, any small mammals.{\r}

561
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,547
用甜糖漿作誘餌，然後抓住獵物並進食
{\fs12}Uses a sweet syrup as bait, then holds onto its catch and feeds on it.{\r}

562
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:22,925
什麼是電報藤？
{\fs12}What's the telegraph vine?{\r}

563
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:27,181
研究證明，電報藤可以向同一物種發出信號...
{\fs12}The vine, research has proven, can signal to other vines of the same species...{\r}

564
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:30,268
...距離可達20到100英里
{\fs12}...vines 20 to 100 miles away.{\r}

565
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:33,898
史考特先生，植物和蔬菜有智慧已經老掉牙了
{\fs12}Intelligence in plants and vegetables is an old story, Mr. Scott.{\r}

566
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,986
歷史比忽視它的傲慢動物還要久
{\fs12}Older even than the animal arrogance that has overlooked it.{\r}

567
00:41:37,154 --> 00:41:38,863
-這個給里普利         -看這裡
{\fs12}-That's one for Ripley.    -Look here.{\r}

568
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:43,621
這是我從手掌的軟組織取下來的
{\fs12}I took this from under the soft tissue in the palm of the hand.{\r}

569
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:45,915
-一個莢果              -莢果？
{\fs12}-A seedpod.      -Seedpod?{\r}

570
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:51,674
是的，植物之嚴整不含糊的生殖技術
{\fs12}Yes. The neat and unconfused reproductive technique of vegetation.{\r}

571
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,012
沒有我們所知的痛苦或愉悅
{\fs12}No pain or pleasure as we know it.{\r}

572
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,181
沒有情緒...
{\fs12}No emotions...{\r}

573
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:58,725
...沒有心思
{\fs12}...no heart.{\r}

574
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:03,524
優於我們，全方位超越我們
{\fs12}Our superior. Our superior in every way.{\r}

575
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,153
先生們，你們能理解我們的大發現嗎？
{\fs12}Gentlemen, do you realize what we've found?{\r}

576
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,410
來自另一個世界的生物 與我們極端的不同
{\fs12}A being from another world as different from us as one pole from the other.{\r}

577
00:42:11,578 --> 00:42:14,330
只要我們能與它溝通...
{\fs12}If we can only communicate with it...{\r}

578
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:19,338
...我們可以學習並揭開人類起源的秘密...
{\fs12}...we can learn secrets that have been hidden from mankind since the beginning...{\r}

579
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:34,953
老天，它在動
{\fs12}Holy cat. It's moving.{\r}

580
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,373
-尼克森小姐        -是的，博士？
{\fs12}-Miss Nicholson.     -Yes, doctor?{\r}

581
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:41,588
凌晨12點10分，這隻手活了起來
{\fs12}At 12:10 a.m., the hand became alive.{\r}

582
00:42:43,008 --> 00:42:48,014
前臂的溫度升高20度
{\fs12}The temperature of the forearm showed a 20-degree rise.{\r}

583
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:51,603
由於溫度上升，我相信它能夠攝取...
{\fs12}Because of this rise in temperature, I believe it was able to ingest...{\r}

584
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,523
...它所覆蓋的犬血，我相信...
{\fs12}...the canine blood with which it was covered. I believe...{\r}

585
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:59,280
你的意思是...你是說它以血液維生
{\fs12}You mean... You mean it lives on blood.{\r}

586
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:03,727
-只能找到這個      -如果這不行，那就沒轍了
{\fs12}-This is the best we could find.
-If doesn't work I don't know what will.{\r}

587
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:06,899
-隊長去哪兒？    -盡可能找到我們的訪客
{\fs12}-Where are you going captain?
-To find our visitor, if we can.{\r}

588
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,817
等等，隊長！
{\fs12}One moment, captain!{\r}

589
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:12,865
再檢查一次庫房，所有的外門都上栓
{\fs12}Check the storeroom again. Bolt any outside doors.{\r}

590
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:15,411
隊長，當你找到想找的東西時...
{\fs12}Captain, when you find what you're looking for...{\r}

591
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:17,706
...記住它是身處異地的陌生人
{\fs12}...remember it's a stranger in a strange land.{\r}

592
00:43:17,873 --> 00:43:20,376
唯一的罪行是出於自衛
{\fs12}The only crimes were those committed against it.{\r}

593
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:24,883
自冰塊中醒來，受一群狗攻擊 被人槍擊
{\fs12}It woke from a block of ice, was attacked by dogs and shot by a frightened man.{\r}

594
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:31,016
-我只求一個溝通的機會   -關起來後再說吧
{\fs12}-All I want is a chance to communicate with it.
-Fine, provided it's locked up.{\r}

595
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:35,314
如果抓住他，被作成沙拉之前 先讓我拍照
{\fs12}If we catch him, let me take his picture before somebody makes a salad of him.{\r}

596
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,859
當然，史考特
{\fs12}Sure, Scotty.{\r}

597
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:43,993
-鮑伯，上那邊     -怎麼回事？像個私刑派對
{\fs12}-Bob, get up on there.
-What's up? Looks like a lynching party.{\r}

598
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,246
-有訪客嗎？         -鬼也沒有
{\fs12}-Have any visitors?    -Not a soul.{\r}

599
00:43:46,455 --> 00:43:51,086
收到了將軍的部分信息，要暫緩史考特的報導
{\fs12}I got part of a message from the general.
He said to wait on Mr. Scott's story.{\r}

600
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,798
還不是白說？反正現在什麼也發不出去
{\fs12}What's the difference? Nothing's going out anyway.{\r}

601
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:56,510
-你在找什麼？       -不可能來這裡
{\fs12}-What are you looking for?   -Couldn't come in here.{\r}

602
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,096
-誰？           -火星人
{\fs12}-Who?     -The man from Mars.{\r}

603
00:43:58,264 --> 00:43:59,889
你的意思...他還活著嗎？
{\fs12}You mean he's alive and loose?{\r}

604
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:03,437
把門鎖好。有必要就用斧頭，槍沒用
{\fs12}Keep your door locked. Use your axe if you have to. Gun's no good.{\r}

605
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:06,399
你說槍沒用是啥意思？現在...
{\fs12}What do you mean the gun's no good? Now, look...{\r}

606
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,323
艾迪
{\fs12}Eddie.{\r}

607
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:15,330
停，隊長。
{\fs12}Hold it, captain.{\r}

608
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:40,865
-這裡有蹊蹺         -你有點離譜
{\fs12}-There's something in here, all right.
-You're a little off base.{\r}

609
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:44,243
那是礦物實驗室，有放射性同位素
{\fs12}That's the mineralogy lab. Radioactive isotopes are in there.{\r}

610
00:44:44,412 --> 00:44:48,083
滿屋子的鈾礦石 偵測器當然會有反應
{\fs12}Your Geiger's reacting to a roomful of uranium ore samples.{\r}

611
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:50,086
是啊
{\fs12}Yeah.{\r}

612
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:04,347
-門被鎖住了       -史登博士有鑰匙
{\fs12}-This door's locked.    -Dr. Stern has the key.{\r}

613
00:45:04,515 --> 00:45:06,475
-哦，是的       -裡面是什麼？
{\fs12}-Oh, yes.      -What's in here?{\r}

614
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,062
溫室，愛斯基摩人受不了草莓的誘惑
{\fs12}The greenhouse. The Eskimos have a weakness for our strawberries.{\r}

615
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:13,860
-北極的草莓           -對不起
{\fs12}-Strawberries at the North Pole.   -Excuse me.{\r}

616
00:45:18,952 --> 00:45:20,786
麥克。鮑伯
{\fs12}Mac. Bob.{\r}

617
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:23,333
查看桌底下
{\fs12}Look under these tables.{\r}

618
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:32,178
鮑伯，去檢查門外
{\fs12}Bob, check that outside door.{\r}

619
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:38,519
-門鎖住了，長官       -什麼都沒有
{\fs12}-Door's locked, sir.    -Nothing up here.{\r}

620
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,107
還是揮棒落空
{\fs12}We're still batting zero.{\r}

621
00:45:42,902 --> 00:45:44,736
-博士？         -隊長，我...
{\fs12}-Well, doctor?     -Captain, I...{\r}

622
00:45:44,905 --> 00:45:47,824
其他走廊也沒有     -有建議嗎，博士？
{\fs12}-Nothing up that other corridor.    -Any suggestions, doctor?{\r}

623
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:50,788
-顯然他不在室內     -我們去外面找...
{\fs12}-He's obviously not inside.   -We'll start looking outside...{\r}

624
00:45:50,955 --> 00:45:52,916
-請關上門            -算了
{\fs12}-Close the door, please.   -Never mind.{\r}

625
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:57,547
隊長，現在在外面只能撐半小時，輪流比較好
{\fs12}Captain, half an hour outside now is all we can stand. We'd better do it in relay.{\r}

626
00:45:57,756 --> 00:46:02,303
-沒錯，查普曼博士。我們會解決... -關上門好嗎？
{\fs12}-You're right, Dr. Chapman. We'll work out...
-Would you close the door, please?{\r}

627
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:04,683
我們得通知福格蒂將軍發生了什麼事
{\fs12}We have to tell General Fogarty what happened.{\r}

628
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,476
我們可能會出名
{\fs12}We're liable to become famous.{\r}

629
00:46:06,602 --> 00:46:12,527
很少有人會吹噓在同一天內搞丟了飛碟和火星人
{\fs12}So few people can boast they've lost a flying saucer and a man from Mars all in one day.{\r}

630
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:16,825
如果哥倫布發現美洲又走失了 人們會怎麼待他
{\fs12}Wonder what they'd have done to Columbus if he'd discovered America, then mislaid it.{\r}

631
00:46:16,993 --> 00:46:18,785
一群笨手笨腳的
{\fs12}Bunch of butterfingers.{\r}

632
00:46:18,996 --> 00:46:21,832
先生們，我碰巧注意到...
{\fs12}Gentlemen, I just happened to notice...{\r}

633
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,585
看看這些苔蘚
{\fs12}Look at these moss.{\r}

634
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,622
它們枯萎了。只有一件事會...
{\fs12}They're wilted. The only thing that could...{\r}

635
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,543
如果後門被打開，一陣冰冷的空氣
{\fs12}A blast of icy air if that rear door was opened.{\r}

636
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,921
教授，去看看那把鎖         -是
{\fs12}-Have a look at that lock, professor.   -Yes.{\r}

637
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:42,886
-曝露10或15秒就夠了    -確實
{\fs12}-10 or 15 seconds of exposure would do it.    -Exactly.{\r}

638
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:45,682
你的結論是什麼？
{\fs12}What would that lead you to?{\r}

639
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:48,562
可能是...
{\fs12}That it may have been...{\r}

640
00:46:48,729 --> 00:46:52,399
-在這裡                -毫無疑問
{\fs12}-In here.      -Without a doubt.{\r}

641
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:56,000
卡林頓博士，你是對的。鎖被重新鎖上
{\fs12}Dr. Carrington, you were right.
The lock's been forced back into position.{\r}

642
00:46:56,015 --> 00:47:00,562
鑰匙不見了。有人進來過 離開時在外面...
{\fs12}The key's gone. Someone has entered and gone and locked the door from...{\r}

643
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:03,734
-鎖了門      -瞧瞧它如何迎著光閃閃發亮？
{\fs12}-From the outside.   -Look. See how it glistens in the light?{\r}

644
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:06,155
聞起來像...
{\fs12}It's a smear of...{\r}

645
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:10,452
-植物汁液。來自傷臂？  -你該不會認為...
{\fs12}-Plant sap. From the wounded arm?   -You don't suppose...?{\r}

646
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,788
請打開
{\fs12}Open it, please.{\r}

647
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:27,225
-一隻雪橇犬          -還沒變冷
{\fs12}-One of the sled dogs.    -Not even cold yet.{\r}

648
00:47:28,562 --> 00:47:33,360
-博士，不會有點...？  -乾癟。那裡有血嗎？
{\fs12}-Doctor, doesn't it seem kind of...?
-Shrunken. Is there any blood in there?{\r}

649
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:35,319
-沒有            -沒血
{\fs12}-None.      -No blood.{\r}

650
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:37,573
-沒血嗎？           -血液已被抽走
{\fs12}-No blood?    -Its blood has been drained.{\r}

651
00:47:37,742 --> 00:47:40,244
一切都符合推論
{\fs12}Everything falls right into line.{\r}

652
00:47:41,011 --> 00:47:46,309
像這種生物 要在附近找空地 來這裡會奇怪嗎？
{\fs12}What could be more natural for such a being than seeking out the only open earth nearby?{\r}

653
00:47:46,478 --> 00:47:50,984
它來這裡避難，聽到我們的聲音就跑了
{\fs12}It came here for refuge, heard us and ran.{\r}

654
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,237
-它一直在這，而且會再回來   -最好告訴...
{\fs12}-It's been here. It will come back again.
-We better tell...{\r}

655
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:57,826
我不同意。用科學來處理比軍隊好太多了...
{\fs12}I don't agree. It's far better if science rather than the Army...{\r}

656
00:47:57,994 --> 00:48:02,749
-你確定這是最佳選擇？   -我相信可以與之溝通
{\fs12}-Are you sure this is the best thing to do?
-I'm sure we can communicate with it.{\r}

657
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:07,882
它比我們聰明
這是與它交談的唯一機會，可以學到很多東西
{\fs12}It's wiser than we are. It's our only chance to talk to it, to learn so many things.{\r}

658
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:11,219
-卡林頓博士是對的    -你當然明白，史登
{\fs12}-Dr. Carrington is right.   -Surely you understand that, Stern.{\r}

659
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,391
今晚你們願意跟我一起在此守候嗎？
{\fs12}Will you two stand guard here with me tonight?{\r}

660
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,018
-當然，博士          -很好
{\fs12}-Surely, doctor.       -All right.{\r}

661
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:19,481
史登，告訴奧爾巴赫和奧爾森博士我們的發現
{\fs12}Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Olson what we've found.{\r}

662
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:23,321
請他們早上回來接替我們
{\fs12}Ask them to come back and relieve us in the morning.{\r}

663
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:27,535
請告訴他們，不可向任何人透露
{\fs12}And tell them, please, to confide in no one.{\r}

664
00:48:43,058 --> 00:48:46,686
-有斬獲，隊長？ -李，最好多準備一些咖啡
{\fs12}-Any luck, captain?   -Lee, you better get some more coffee ready.{\r}

665
00:48:46,854 --> 00:48:49,815
-找到什麼，隊長？     -沒有跡象
{\fs12}-Find anything, captain?    -Not a sign.{\r}

666
00:48:49,984 --> 00:48:52,612
巴恩斯撞見一隻北極熊     -確實
{\fs12}-Barnes flushed a polar bear.    -Sure did.{\r}

667
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:56,033
-嚇到你？     -知道是熊就不怕了
{\fs12}-Scare you?    -Not after I saw it was only a bear.{\r}

668
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:58,745
-太冷了        -你沒發現任何東西
{\fs12}-Too cold out there for that.   -You didn't find anything.{\r}

669
00:48:58,914 --> 00:49:01,917
我不認為你會，失去的就不會再復回
{\fs12}I didn't think you would. When we lose them, they stay lost.{\r}

670
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:06,215
那也沒有多大差異，無線電沒收到信息
{\fs12}Not that it makes much difference.
Nothing's coming in on the radio.{\r}

671
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:10,178
-特克斯，有消息嗎？   -福格蒂大發脾氣
{\fs12}-Tex, you got something?
-General Fogarty's running a temperature.{\r}

672
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,183
10分鐘前還很清晰，然後又斷訊了
{\fs12}This came in clear 10 minutes ago, then it got fouled up again.{\r}

673
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:18,106
"福格蒂致亨德利：
採取一切預防措施，小心保護飛機，直到我抵達"
{\fs12}"Fogarty to Hendry: Take all precautions to preserve aircraft carefully until my arrival."{\r}

674
00:49:18,274 --> 00:49:22,279
老話，"對所有機上的屍體採用相同的預防措施
{\fs12}Same to same. "Use same precautions with corpses of any occupants."{\r}

675
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:26,117
還是老話，"轉發飛行物的詳細說明
{\fs12}Same to same. "Forward detailed description of aircraft.{\r}

676
00:49:26,327 --> 00:49:29,580
尺寸，大約的重量等，很要緊"
{\fs12}Measurements, approximate weight and so forth. Important."{\r}

677
00:49:29,748 --> 00:49:33,335
"福格蒂致亨德利：為什麼沒回應？立即回應"
{\fs12}"Fogarty to Hendry: Why haven't you answered? Want immediate answer."{\r}

678
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:37,884
老話，"無線電不該靜默 參考福格蒂致亨德利信息
{\fs12}Same to same. "Radio silence unnecessary.
Reference message Fogarty to Hendry.{\r}

679
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:39,970
立即回應
{\fs12}Acknowledge immediately.{\r}

680
00:49:40,138 --> 00:49:42,056
等待報告，沉默令人不解"
{\fs12}Waiting report. Silence confusing."{\r}

681
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:44,018
還是老話，“回應”
{\fs12}Same to same. "Acknowledge."{\r}

682
00:49:44,186 --> 00:49:46,105
-同樣的...      -立即回應
{\fs12}-Same to same...    -Acknowledge at once.{\r}

683
00:49:46,272 --> 00:49:50,736
-想必他急需我的報告   -都沒提到我？難以置信
{\fs12}-I gather he wants to hear from me.
-There's nothing for me? I don't believe it.{\r}

684
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:53,156
要升上將軍難道不需...？
{\fs12}How can a man get to be a general without...?{\r}

685
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,579
在溫室裡...
{\fs12}In the greenhouse...{\r}

686
00:49:58,748 --> 00:49:59,998
看到...
{\fs12}See...{\r}

687
00:50:01,169 --> 00:50:04,047
-巴恩斯，去走廊守衛    -拿急救箱來
{\fs12}-Barnes, watch that corridor.   -Bring the first aid kit.{\r}

688
00:50:04,213 --> 00:50:08,218
-這是我的工作   -鮑伯，快去警告其他人
{\fs12}-Captain, this is my job.
-Bob, better start warning the rest of camp.{\r}

689
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:12,642
-這裡能廣播嗎？   -左開關可全體廣播
{\fs12}-Does that speaker system work from here?
-Yes. The left switch runs to all rooms.{\r}

690
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,520
注意，營地的所有人，將門上閂
{\fs12}Attention, everybody in camp. Bolt your doors.{\r}

691
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:19,902
危險的訪客回來了，得到通知前別走動
{\fs12}Our visitor has returned and is dangerous.
Stay where you are until notified.{\r}

692
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,403
請待在原地
{\fs12}Stay where you are.{\r}

693
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:31,543
-慢點，沒事的     -怎麼了，博士？
{\fs12}-Easy. It'll be all right.   -What happened, doctor?{\r}

694
00:50:31,711 --> 00:50:34,422
在溫室裡，我正在工作。我沒看到
{\fs12}In the greenhouse, I was working. I couldn't see.{\r}

695
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,968
突然一陣冷風，我聽到奧爾森的尖叫
{\fs12}Then a blast of cold air, and I heard Olson scream.{\r}

696
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:41,598
-我轉身時，那東西襲擊我    -繼續
{\fs12}-When I turned, the thing struck at me.   -Go on.{\r}

697
00:50:41,767 --> 00:50:45,437
我不記得了，我的頭...我一定摔倒了
{\fs12}I don't remember. My head... I must have fallen.{\r}

698
00:50:46,065 --> 00:50:49,068
當我趕到，看到了奧爾森和奧爾巴赫。他們...
{\fs12}When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach. They were...{\r}

699
00:50:49,277 --> 00:50:53,408
再給他喝一些。去拿斧頭。繼續，博士
{\fs12}Give him some more of that. Get those axes. Go ahead, doctor.{\r}

700
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:59,124
他們倒掛在樑上，死了。喉嚨被切開了
{\fs12}They were both hanging from the beams upside down, dead. Their throats were cut.{\r}

701
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:00,960
-我用爬的...    -你離開時 它在哪兒？
{\fs12}-I crawled...    -Was it there when you left?{\r}

702
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:02,879
我看不到
{\fs12}I couldn't see.{\r}

703
00:51:03,506 --> 00:51:07,344
長官，給你    -等等，帕特！我想拍照
{\fs12}-Here you are, sir.   -Wait, Pat! I want to get a picture.{\r}

704
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:19,194
等一下。他可以從外門退出溫室
{\fs12}Wait a minute. He could get out of the greenhouse through the outside door.{\r}

705
00:51:19,361 --> 00:51:23,073
-我們可以穿過電機室到那邊  -你倆跟他去
{\fs12}-We can get to it through the generator room.
-You two go with him.{\r}

706
00:51:23,242 --> 00:51:26,579
-你是說進去？    -想辦法把門封死
{\fs12}-You mean go in?   -Seal the door with anything you can find.{\r}

707
00:51:26,748 --> 00:51:28,666
那更好
{\fs12}That's better.{\r}

708
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:33,255
-慢點，先等他們進去    -帕特，我要拍照
{\fs12}-Easy. Give them time to get in there.
-Pat, I want a picture.{\r}

709
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,552
-你回去休息         -別傻了
{\fs12}-You get back with the rest.   -Don't be silly.{\r}

710
00:51:36,762 --> 00:51:39,056
-用酒賄賂他       -我請他喝啤酒
{\fs12}-It'll cost you a drink.    -I'll buy him a beer.{\r}

711
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:47,233
-好了嗎，鮑伯？      -還沒，但打開吧
{\fs12}-Ready, Bob?     -No, but go ahead and open it.{\r}

712
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:05,093
拿東西來抵住這扇門，能夠頂住門閂下方！
{\fs12}Get something to prop this door, something short enough to get under this bolt!{\r}

713
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:09,849
-拍到了嗎，史考特？    -沒。門關太快了
{\fs12}-Get your picture, Scotty?
-No. The door wasn't open long enough.{\r}

714
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:12,269
-要我再打開一次嗎？      -不要！
{\fs12}-Want me to open it again?     -No!{\r}

715
00:52:12,437 --> 00:52:15,774
-拿一把錘子和一些錐子！  -釘進去好嗎？
{\fs12}-Bring a hammer and some spikes!
-Hit that in, will you?{\r}

716
00:52:18,196 --> 00:52:20,156
好了，這樣應該行了
{\fs12}There. That ought to do it.{\r}

717
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:24,161
查普曼博士，您確定沒其他出路？沒窗戶？
{\fs12}Doctor Chapman, you're sure there's no other way out? No windows?{\r}

718
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:26,373
-只有前門和後門       -牆壁堅固嗎？
{\fs12}-Only the front and back doors.   -The walls solid?{\r}

719
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,043
-瓦楞鐵皮        -你該不會認為...？
{\fs12}-Corrugated iron.    -You don't think that...?{\r}

720
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,556
你發現了一條狗被抽光血，為什麼不報告？
{\fs12}You found a dog in there, bled white by our visitor. Why didn't you report it?{\r}

721
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:41,101
-那沒必要     -讓朋友死去就有必要嗎？
{\fs12}-It wasn't necessary.   -It was necessary to leave friends to die?{\r}

722
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,854
我派他們去當守衛...
{\fs12}I posted them as guards...{\r}

723
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:47,862
我查過了。他們像屠體一樣倒掛著。希望你能瞧瞧
{\fs12}I looked in. They're hanging upside down like in a slaughterhouse. Wish you'd seen it.{\r}

724
00:52:48,029 --> 00:52:49,990
-我們不做點什麼嗎？     -他們死了
{\fs12}-Can't we do something?   -They're dead.{\r}

725
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:54,788
別讓其他人步入他們的後塵，博士
你被限制行動於你的房間，實驗室和食堂
{\fs12}Let's see nobody joins them. Doctor,
you're limited to your room, lab and the mess hall.{\r}

726
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:58,500
你沒有得到任何授權。沒權利去執行...
{\fs12}You have no authority of any kind. No right to assume...{\r}

727
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:00,838
你還是走吧
{\fs12}You better move along.{\r}

728
00:53:06,346 --> 00:53:08,766
我們把後門封住了。如果他想走...
{\fs12}We've got the rear door blocked. If he gets out...{\r}

729
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:12,104
...就必須鑿穿儲油槽和幾噸的雪
{\fs12}...he'll have to dig through oil drums and a couple tons of snow.{\r}

730
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:17,278
-鮑伯，下次瞄準點   -我根本沒時間去想
{\fs12}-Bob, next time raise the sights a little.
-I was too busy to think about that.{\r}

731
00:53:17,488 --> 00:53:20,365
我們必須在走廊這裡布哨
{\fs12}We're gonna have to set up a guard here in the corridor.{\r}

732
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:25,247
-兩小時輪哨，徵求志願者   -算我一個
{\fs12}-Two-hour shifts. We'll need volunteers.
-Count me in, captain.{\r}

733
00:53:33,803 --> 00:53:35,971
是你召集我們嗎，博士？
{\fs12}You sent for us, doctor?{\r}

734
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:43,356
博士，你說有新消息要給我們
{\fs12}You said you had news for us, doctor.{\r}

735
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,208
抱歉，我好累。我未曾闔眼
{\fs12}Sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept.{\r}

736
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,378
這很難...
{\fs12}It's difficult...{\r}

737
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:51,340
難以啟口
{\fs12}Difficult to talk.{\r}

738
00:53:52,008 --> 00:53:55,930
-讀一下我的筆記好嗎，尼克森小姐？
-博士，你需要休息一下
{\fs12}-Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?   -Doctor, you need some rest.{\r}

739
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:58,433
是的，我知道，但...
{\fs12}Yes, I know, but...{\r}

740
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,938
請朗讀我的筆記
{\fs12}Please read my notes.{\r}

741
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:05,902
"晚上9點，我將斷臂中取出的種子 播種...
{\fs12}"At 9:00 p.m., I placed the seeds taken from the severed hand of X...{\r}

742
00:54:06,112 --> 00:54:07,821
...在四英寸的泥土上
{\fs12}...in four inches of earth.{\r}

743
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,659
我把泥土飽和的...
{\fs12}I saturated the earth...{\r}

744
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,209
我從血庫裡拿兩單位的血漿 與泥土充分混合
{\fs12}I saturated the earth with two units of plasma taken from our blood bank.{\r}

745
00:54:16,377 --> 00:54:19,714
溫室中的狗的情況 顯示出血液...
{\fs12}The condition of the dog found in the greenhouse indicated blood...{\r}

746
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,884
...是該種子育苗的最主要因素
{\fs12}...was a primal factor in the cultivation of the seeds.{\r}

747
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:25,471
凌晨2點...
{\fs12}At 2:00 a.m...{\r}

748
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:30,061
凌晨2點，第一株芽冒出土壤"
{\fs12}At 2:00 a.m., the first sprouts appeared through the soil."{\r}

749
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:34,901
-五個小時    -是，再加了兩單位血漿
{\fs12}-Five hours.   -Yes. I used another two units of plasma.{\r}

750
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:40,200
凌晨4點，胚芽開始呈現明確的形狀
{\fs12}At 4:00 a.m., the sprouts began to take on definite form.{\r}

751
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:42,830
我總結了...
{\fs12}I came to the conclu...{\r}

752
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:48,545
從你們的表情看，你們不相信我
{\fs12}I see by your faces you don't believe me.{\r}

753
00:54:48,714 --> 00:54:53,219
那你自己來判斷吧
{\fs12}Well, you may judge for yourselves.{\r}

754
00:55:10,703 --> 00:55:13,289
喔，不。這是不可能的
{\fs12}Oh, no. It isn't possible.{\r}

755
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:16,710
-它自我複製          -速度驚人
{\fs12}-It reproduces itself.    -Amazing speed.{\r}

756
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:20,215
這會加深亨德利隊長的印象
{\fs12}This would bear out Capt. Hendry's impression.{\r}

757
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:24,054
他在溫室看到那生物時，又長出新手臂了
{\fs12}When he saw the creature in the greenhouse, it had grown a new arm.{\r}

758
00:55:24,223 --> 00:55:28,103
-在脈動嗎，博士？     -好像在呼吸
{\fs12}-This pulsating, doctor?   -As though they were breathing.{\r}

759
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:32,441
-是，人形植物         -超人類
{\fs12}-Yes. Human plants.     -Superhuman.{\r}

760
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,697
-全都靠血漿培育的？    -正是
{\fs12}-All this because of the blood plasma?  -That's correct.{\r}

761
00:55:36,197 --> 00:55:40,536
注意這些比較接近血漿源；而這些比較遠
{\fs12}Notice these, closer to the source of the plasma. While these, farther away.{\r}

762
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:44,166
-我們還有多少單位？   -夠了，我希望
{\fs12}-How many units have we?    -Enough, I hope.{\r}

763
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:47,462
威爾遜教授，你想聽一聽它們嗎？
{\fs12}Would you care to listen to them, Professor Wilson?{\r}

764
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:50,217
是的，謝謝。我願意
{\fs12}Yes, thank you. I should.{\r}

765
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:10,161
如何？
{\fs12}Well?{\r}

766
00:56:11,456 --> 00:56:15,461
幾乎像一個飢餓的新生兒的哀號
{\fs12}Almost like the wail of a newborn child that's hungry.{\r}

767
00:56:15,627 --> 00:56:18,130
-我就是這樣描述的       -博士？
{\fs12}-That's the way I would have described it.   -Doctor?{\r}

768
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:21,135
何事，尼克森小姐？  -你會介意嗎，如果...？
{\fs12}-Yes, Miss Nicholson?   -Would you mind very much if I...?{\r}

769
00:56:21,303 --> 00:56:25,725
-我要繼續留著嗎？  -不，去繕打筆記吧
{\fs12}-Will you be needing me anymore?   -No. Just finish typing my notes.{\r}

770
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:29,731
拿來還給我，別讓人看到了
{\fs12}Return them to me. Let no one see them.{\r}

771
00:56:30,316 --> 00:56:33,194
博士，我認為想你應該睡個好覺
{\fs12}Doctor, I think you should get some sleep.{\r}

772
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,112
有太多事要做
{\fs12}There's too much to do.{\r}

773
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:38,993
-如果你累壞了，就無法好好思慮
-我頭腦還很清楚
{\fs12}-Your mind can't work if you're exhausted.   -My mind's still clear.{\r}

774
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:43,668
不，不是這樣。溫室發生的事你沒想清楚
{\fs12}No, it isn't, doctor.
You aren't thinking of what's happening in the greenhouse.{\r}

775
00:56:43,877 --> 00:56:47,297
他在那裡用血液培育種子，就像你一樣
{\fs12}He's growing those seeds in there using blood. Just as you are.{\r}

776
00:56:47,465 --> 00:56:51,595
你既已見過 一個生物能夠幹出這種事
想想看，有一千個
{\fs12}You've seen what one creature like that can do. Just imagine a thousand.{\r}

777
00:56:51,763 --> 00:56:54,224
-我已經想過了           -亞瑟...
{\fs12}-I have imagined it.    -Arthur...{\r}

778
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:57,853
...如果那飛形物來地球 不僅僅是來拜訪...
{\fs12}...what if that aircraft came not just to visit the Earth...{\r}

779
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:03,403
...而是要征服呢？培養某種可怕的軍隊？
{\fs12}...but to conquer it? To start growing some kind of horrible army?{\r}

780
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:07,868
-以人類為食嗎？    -威脅我們的事太多了...
{\fs12}-To turn the human race into food for it?
-Many things threaten our world...{\r}

781
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:11,330
...新星，彗星撞擊...   -但那些是理論
{\fs12}...new stars, comets shooting...  -But those are theories.{\r}

782
00:57:11,499 --> 00:57:14,419
-而這是現行的敵人   -科學界沒有敵人...
{\fs12}-This is an enemy here.
-There are no enemies in science...{\r}

783
00:57:14,586 --> 00:57:19,134
...只有研究的現象，我們正在研究一個
{\fs12}...only phenomena to study. We are studying one.{\r}

784
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:33,402
進來吧
{\fs12}Come in.{\r}

785
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:41,874
-帕特       -妮基，我想問你一件事
{\fs12}-Hello, Pat.   -Hi. Nikki, I want to ask you something.{\r}

786
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:46,046
最近有人受傷嗎？被槍傷，刺傷或動手術？
{\fs12}Has anybody up here been hurt lately?
Anybody shot, stabbed or operated on?{\r}

787
00:57:46,214 --> 00:57:49,467
沒有，溫室裡那東西是第一個轉診病人
{\fs12}No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse has been our first diversion.{\r}

788
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:54,307
兩個月前我帶來了35單位血漿，哪裡去了？
{\fs12}I brought up 35 units of blood plasma two months ago. What's become of it?{\r}

789
00:57:54,476 --> 00:57:58,021
-為什麼想知道？  -怎不給史登博士輸血？
{\fs12}-Why do you want to know?
-Why are they not giving it to Dr. Stern?{\r}

790
00:57:58,231 --> 00:58:02,528
他們不用血漿，反而要兩個人去捐血
{\fs12}They're giving him blood transfusions instead of plasma. Two live donors.{\r}

791
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:05,866
妮基，卡林頓拿35單位的血漿去做什麼？
{\fs12}What's Carrington doing with 35 units of blood plasma, Niki?{\r}

792
00:58:06,033 --> 00:58:07,742
我想...
{\fs12}I guess...{\r}

793
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:12,542
你最好在我下巴揮一拳 再去看看那筆記
{\fs12}I guess you'd better take a swing at my chin and have a look at those notes.{\r}

794
00:58:13,211 --> 00:58:15,505
我應該設法阻止你的
{\fs12}I should be trying to stop you.{\r}

795
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:23,892
原來他一直都在這麼幹
{\fs12}So that's what he's been doing.{\r}

796
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,855
謝了，謝謝你沒阻止我
{\fs12}Thanks. Thanks for not stopping me.{\r}

797
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:33,322
帕特，提醒你一下好嗎？他累了
{\fs12}Pat, would you remember something? He's tired.{\r}

798
00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:37,703
你發現那東西以後，他沒睡過覺而思慮不清
{\fs12}He hasn't slept since you found that thing. And he's not thinking right.{\r}

799
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:40,749
我了解他，他的思維模式跟我們不同
{\fs12}I know him. And he doesn't think the way we do anyway.{\r}

800
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:45,464
但發現了人類無法理解的東西時
他會很執著想解開謎題，他...
{\fs12}But he's found something no one can understand. Until he can solve it, he'Il...{\r}

801
00:58:45,632 --> 00:58:49,595
-就像一個孩子有了新玩具...  -這玩具會咬人
{\fs12}-You know, like a kid with a new toy...
-Only this toy's liable to bite him.{\r}

802
00:58:49,762 --> 00:58:51,095
再次感謝
{\fs12}Thanks again.{\r}

803
00:58:59,526 --> 00:59:01,027
卡林頓博士在哪裡？
{\fs12}Where's Dr. Carrington?{\r}

804
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:04,156
對不起，我沒有被授權給你...
{\fs12}I'm sorry. I have no authorization to give you any...{\r}

805
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:07,203
-我很忙      -我知道你很忙，博士
{\fs12}-I'm very busy.    -I know you're busy, doctor.{\r}

806
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:09,831
我知道你一直在搞園藝，它們在哪？
{\fs12}I understand you've been gardening. Where are they?{\r}

807
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:12,502
-幹嘛？      -育嬰室往這邊走，帕特
{\fs12}-Why?     -This way to the nursery, Pat.{\r}

808
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:18,009
我不能容忍實驗室被人硬闖，別碰
{\fs12}I don't tolerate intrusions into my laboratory. Don't touch.{\r}

809
00:59:18,177 --> 00:59:21,138
這就是你和同事在溫室裡搞的東西
{\fs12}This is what your colleagues are doing in the greenhouse.{\r}

810
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:24,227
-這是得寸進尺  -發生那件事 不是我的錯
{\fs12}-This is an improvement.   -What happened was not my fault.{\r}

811
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:27,189
我們看過你的筆記了，你應該跟我們商量
{\fs12}We've read your notes. You should have consulted us.{\r}

812
00:59:27,357 --> 00:59:30,151
我人手夠了，而你的看法沒被採納
{\fs12}I have the help I need. Your opinion has not been asked.{\r}

813
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,617
隊長採納了，我已給他建議，我可以重說一次
{\fs12}It has by Capt. Hendry. And I've given it to him. I'll repeat it for you.{\r}

814
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:37,495
我們面臨著一些無法預測的危險
{\fs12}We're facing something unpredictably dangerous.{\r}

815
00:59:37,664 --> 00:59:41,001
溫室中的生物 很顯然正在複製自己
{\fs12}The creature in the greenhouse is obviously multiplying itself.{\r}

816
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,296
我們無法得知有多少
{\fs12}We have no way of finding out how much.{\r}

817
00:59:43,463 --> 00:59:46,216
它需要更多的血，而且會設法去滿足它的需求
{\fs12}It will need more blood and will try to obtain what it needs.{\r}

818
00:59:46,384 --> 00:59:49,971
-它被監禁而無害   -你怎能確保我們的安全？
{\fs12}-It's imprisoned and harmless.
-How can you be sure of our safety?{\r}

819
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:51,764
或是全世界的安危？
{\fs12}Or the safety of the world?{\r}

820
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:56,522
想想一千個這樣的生物。 一萬個
必須摧毀它，連帶這些子孫
{\fs12}Think of 1000 such creatures. 10,000.
It must be destroyed, this progeny with it.{\r}

821
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,441
-不              -我們可以用燒的
{\fs12}-No.      -We can burn these.{\r}

822
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,362
-溫室裡的東西呢？   -你像驚慌的男孩
{\fs12}-What about that thing in the greenhouse?    -You're like frightened boys.{\r}

823
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:05,620
-說對了，我很害怕   -任何毀損都是暴行...
{\fs12}-You're right. I am frightened.
-Any destruction would be an outrage...{\r}

824
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:07,788
...對科學的背叛      -也許吧
{\fs12}...a betrayal of science.    -It may be.{\r}

825
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:11,209
-但如果能除掉它，我會睡得安穩
-隊長，巴恩斯終於...
{\fs12}-But I'll sleep better if we get rid of it.
-Captain, Barnes finally...{\r}

826
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:13,046
...發出了一則訊息，這是回應
{\fs12}...got a message through. Here's the answer.{\r}

827
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:14,881
-繼續           -"福格蒂致亨德利：
{\fs12}-Go ahead.      -"Fogarty to Hendry:{\r}

828
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:20,598
卡林頓通知我火星人還活著 讓它活著並保護它免受傷害
{\fs12}Carrington informs me Martian alive.
Keep it alive and protect it against injury.{\r}

829
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:24,437
在我到之前，在任何情況下都不許採取抗命的行動"
{\fs12}Under no circumstances take action against it until my arrival."{\r}

830
01:00:24,605 --> 01:00:29,319
你接到命令了，隊長。我認為他們英明睿智
{\fs12}You have your orders, Capt. Hendry.
I consider them sane and intelligent.{\r}

831
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:32,448
-特克斯，我呢？   -什麼都沒有，史考特
{\fs12}-But, Tex, what about me?   -Not a thing, Scotty.{\r}

832
01:00:33,158 --> 01:00:37,080
-要怎麼辦，帕特？ -設法改變陸軍的想法
{\fs12}-What do we do, Pat?   -Try changing the Army's mind.{\r}

833
01:00:47,262 --> 01:00:51,600
嘿!嘿，是我，艾迪！
{\fs12}Hey! Hey, it's me, Eddie!{\r}

834
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,442
-你們進來幹嘛？     -我們撐不住了
{\fs12}-What are you doing here?   -We can't take it out there.{\r}

835
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:01,072
打消在外面守衛的念頭吧
{\fs12}Drop the idea of guarding from the outside.{\r}

836
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,409
風太強了，你看不到東西
{\fs12}The wind's blowing so hard you can't see.{\r}

837
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,705
它能穿牆就像進門一樣簡單
{\fs12}It can go through walls as easy as doors.{\r}

838
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,208
-他怎麼穿過鐵皮牆？    -用開罐器呀
{\fs12}-How could it get through iron walls?   -Use a can opener.{\r}

839
01:01:09,377 --> 01:01:13,757
-我們撤離外面的守衛   -把那手放入冰水
{\fs12}-We're dropping the outside guard.   -Put that hand in some ice water.{\r}

840
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:16,677
-誰在外面走廊？  -史東和威爾遜，長官
{\fs12}-Who's out in the corridor?   -Stone and Wilson, sir.{\r}

841
01:01:16,846 --> 01:01:20,684
巴恩斯，他們是唯一的衛哨，要他們小心
{\fs12}Barnes, tell them they're the only ones on guard. Tell them to watch it.{\r}

842
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:26,608
-特克斯？       -我在這
{\fs12}-Tex?     -Here I am.{\r}

843
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:29,529
這裡不宜久留，我們撤離了外線衛哨
{\fs12}You won't be very long. We're dropping the outside guard.{\r}

844
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:31,991
快跟其他人進入食堂
{\fs12}Come join the rest of them in the mess hall.{\r}

845
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,205
我沒事的，門抵妥了，而且沒有外部窗戶
{\fs12}I'll be all right. I've got the door braced,
and there's no outside windows.{\r}

846
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:38,876
好，你想當勇士也行
{\fs12}All right. If you want to be brave.{\r}

847
01:01:40,086 --> 01:01:43,006
-那麼         -帕特，接下來呢？
{\fs12}-Well.    -Pat, what are we gonna do?{\r}

848
01:01:45,637 --> 01:01:47,597
這裡有人想要咖啡嗎？
{\fs12}Anybody around here want some coffee?{\r}

849
01:01:47,764 --> 01:01:49,389
沒有，但進來沒關係
{\fs12}No, but you can come in.{\r}

850
01:01:49,558 --> 01:01:53,103
這是我的藉口，我希望你們會叫我進來
{\fs12}That's the reason I brought it. I was hoping you might ask me in.{\r}

851
01:01:54,107 --> 01:01:56,985
-誰想要一些？    -我可以喝掉一半
{\fs12}-Who wants some?     -I could use a half.{\r}

852
01:01:57,235 --> 01:02:00,948
-你在說什麼，史考特？  -我在想...夠了，謝謝
{\fs12}-What were you saying, Scotty?
-I was wondering... That's enough. Thanks.{\r}

853
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:06,791
如果我們這位朋友覺得寂寞 到處遊蕩
最後停留此處，會發生什麼事？
{\fs12}What happens if our boyfriend gets lonely and strolls around and ends up in here?{\r}

854
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:09,293
-我一直想了解      -什麼都傷不了它
{\fs12}-I've been figuring that.    -Nothing hurts it.{\r}

855
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:12,674
-你會怎麼料理蔬菜？     -煮了呀
{\fs12}-What do you do with a vegetable?   -Boil it.{\r}

856
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:18,014
-你說什麼？      -煎 煮 炒 炸
{\fs12}-What'd you say?   -Boil it. Stew it. Bake it. Fry it.{\r}

857
01:02:18,182 --> 01:02:20,351
-有道理             -它不怕冷
{\fs12}-That makes sense.   -Cold doesn't bother it.{\r}

858
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:23,605
也許卡林頓博士會請它爬進湯鍋
{\fs12}Maybe Dr. Carrington will ask it to crawl into a boiler.{\r}

859
01:02:23,815 --> 01:02:27,569
-也許你能借到一部火焰噴射器
-隊長，我有一個瘋狂的想法
{\fs12}-Maybe you could borrow a flamethrower.   -Captain, I got a crazy idea.{\r}

860
01:02:27,737 --> 01:02:30,198
我們有很多煤油，我們可以...
{\fs12}We got lots of kerosene and we could...{\r}

861
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:39,796
-點三。點四     -這是我們燒菜的地方
{\fs12}-Point three. Point four.   -Here's where we start cooking.{\r}

862
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:43,008
點五。點六。
{\fs12}Point five. Point six.{\r}

863
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:46,305
那東西走出溫室了。待在一起
{\fs12}That thing's out of the greenhouse. Stay together.{\r}

864
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:50,435
點九。把煤油扔在它身上，然後放火燒如何？
{\fs12}Point nine. What about throwing kerosene on it and setting it on fire?{\r}

865
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:52,313
-不妨試試         -這裡有一整罐
{\fs12}-We can try.      -Here's a full can.{\r}

866
01:02:52,481 --> 01:02:54,984
我來拿。我們需要找東西來裝
{\fs12}I'll take it. We'll need something to put it in.{\r}

867
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:57,111
-這有桶子          -另一個桶子
{\fs12}-Here's a pail.     -Here's another.{\r}

868
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,197
-一點二           -再去找一個
{\fs12}-One point two.      -We need one more.{\r}

869
01:02:59,324 --> 01:03:01,576
-帕特，可以用這個     -好
{\fs12}-Pat, this one will work all right.    -Good.{\r}

870
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:03,620
小心香煙，中尉
{\fs12}Watch that cigarette, lieutenant.{\r}

871
01:03:03,788 --> 01:03:06,041
我們要怎樣點火，鑽木取火？
{\fs12}How we gonna set it on fire, rub sticks together?{\r}

872
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:08,294
-我背包裡有信號槍      -我去拿
{\fs12}-There's a Veri pistol in my bag.   -I'll get it.{\r}

873
01:03:08,503 --> 01:03:12,174
它一進來，你就潑油。麥克，發射準一點
{\fs12}If it comes in, you wet it down. Mac, touch it off. And don't miss.{\r}

874
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,761
-如果需要更多油，你要準備好    -你是對的
{\fs12}-You be ready if it needs more.    -You're right.{\r}

875
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:16,764
-閉嘴        -現在一點三了
{\fs12}-Shut up.     -One point three now.{\r}

876
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:20,353
-你知道怎麼開槍嗎？   -我在電影看過
{\fs12}-You know how to shoot that?   -I saw Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.{\r}

877
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,275
-一點四         -過來，躲在角落
{\fs12}-One point four.   -Come here. Get in the corner.{\r}

878
01:03:24,443 --> 01:03:26,904
拿這個檔在面前，待在電燈開關旁
{\fs12}Hold this in front of you. Stay by the light switch.{\r}

879
01:03:27,072 --> 01:03:30,492
一點五。一點六
{\fs12}One point five. One point six.{\r}

880
01:03:31,118 --> 01:03:33,704
-那是什麼？      -聽起來像是窗戶
{\fs12}-What was that?    -It sounded like a window.{\r}

881
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,125
-一點八            -關掉那些燈
{\fs12}-One point eight.    -Turn off those lights.{\r}

882
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:39,671
一點九。到了
{\fs12}One point nine. The needle's hit the top.{\r}

883
01:04:11,508 --> 01:04:13,427
-快滅火！           -我在滅啊！
{\fs12}-Put the fire out!    -I am!{\r}

884
01:04:13,594 --> 01:04:15,555
小心，隊長！
{\fs12}Watch it, captain!{\r}

885
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,441
-堵住那窗戶！       -嘿，史考特！
{\fs12}-Block that window!    -Hey, Scotty!{\r}

886
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:41,174
-這會讓你的手舒服點      -謝謝
{\fs12}-This will make your hand feel better.   -Thank you.{\r}

887
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:46,598
-煤油應該夠了       -快準備好
{\fs12}-This ought to be enough kerosene.   -Get it ready.{\r}

888
01:04:46,808 --> 01:04:48,601
-怎麼樣，巴恩斯？     -沒有大礙
{\fs12}-How's it coming, Barnes?    -It'll be okay.{\r}

889
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:52,941
讓我生氣的是他沒有這樣做*
我把它摔倒在舖位上
{\fs12}What makes me mad is he didn't do it.
I busted it falling over the bunk.{\r}

890
01:04:53,108 --> 01:04:55,319
聽著，我們希望你們都待在這裡
{\fs12}Listen, we want you all to stay here.{\r}

891
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:58,490
我們找到了解決之道，卻燒毀了一間房
{\fs12}We found a way to fight this thing, but burned out a room.{\r}

892
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:02,789
-看它起飛的樣子 傷不太重  -頂多與熱腳一樣*
{\fs12}-It's not hurt much, from the way it took off.
-About as much effect as a hot foot.{\r}

893
01:05:02,955 --> 01:05:04,289
它一定會回來
{\fs12}It's sure to come back.{\r}

894
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:08,128
我們不想把這裡全燒了，因此要去追補它
{\fs12}We don't want to burn the whole place. So we're going after it.{\r}

895
01:05:08,297 --> 01:05:10,883
它可能去了溫室，就從那裡開始
{\fs12}It probably went to the greenhouse. We'll start there.{\r}

896
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:14,720
同時，留在這裡。看守進入穿堂的門
{\fs12}Meantime, stay here. Watch the door into the hallway.{\r}

897
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,310
-隨時監看蓋格偵測器    -滅火器在這裡
{\fs12}-Keep your eye on the Geiger counter.
-Here are the fire extinguishers.{\r}

898
01:05:18,477 --> 01:05:21,271
-誰是電子專家？   -這是我的專長
{\fs12}-Who's your electrical expert?   -That's my line.{\r}

899
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,111
-你能掛進對講機系統嗎？  
-在任何房間都能取得
{\fs12}-Can you hook into the intercom system?
-We can take one from any room.{\r}

900
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,740
-我能幫忙    -麥克，我們會在無線電室
{\fs12}-I can help.   -Mac, we'll be in the radio room.{\r}

901
01:05:27,907 --> 01:05:30,201
準備好了就通知我們。你沒事吧？
{\fs12}Let us know when you're ready. You all right?{\r}

902
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,164
是啊，我想跟去      -你還不過癮嗎？
{\fs12}-Yeah. I'd like to tag along.   -Haven't you had enough?{\r}

903
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:35,876
如果我再點燃大火，誰來滅火？
{\fs12}If I start burning up again, who'll put out the fire?{\r}

904
01:05:36,044 --> 01:05:38,547
對於隊長 我們相當感到自豪
{\fs12}We're very proud of our captain.{\r}

905
01:05:40,134 --> 01:05:45,557
放一個對講機在這裡，就能照應到這一邊了
{\fs12}Now, look, put one of the intercoms here. That'll take care of this end.{\r}

906
01:05:45,725 --> 01:05:49,813
另一個放在交界處，看看是否通到食堂
{\fs12}Put another down here at the junction.
See if they work through the mess hall.{\r}

907
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:52,316
你說你會再使用煤油
{\fs12}You said you were gonna use kerosene again.{\r}

908
01:05:52,484 --> 01:05:56,614
-有更好的東西嗎？  -怎麼不用電更熱？
{\fs12}-Know anything better?
-Something hotter. Why not use electricity?{\r}

909
01:05:56,782 --> 01:06:00,746
-用你們的照明系統？  -不，連接新的變壓器
{\fs12}-You mean your lighting system?
-No, we can hook in a new transformer.{\r}

910
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:03,707
-會提供很大的電流    -燒他夠用嗎？
{\fs12}-It will give us plenty of amps.  -Enough to burn him?{\r}

911
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:07,087
-綽綽有餘      -兩個電極能用鉛嗎？
{\fs12}-More than enough.  -Could you use leads to two poles?{\r}

912
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,632
-如果你隔離電極     -聽起來不錯
{\fs12}-If you insulate the poles.   -Sounds good.{\r}

913
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,262
鮑伯，協助他。快，特克斯。上工了
{\fs12}Bob, give him a hand. Come on, Tex. You go to work.{\r}

914
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:16,267
可以的話，接通安克拉治。告訴他們整個故事
{\fs12}Get Anchorage if you can. Tell them the whole story.{\r}

915
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:20,355
說我們狀況不佳，帶上手榴彈，迫擊砲...
{\fs12}Tell them we're in bad shape and to bring hand grenades, mortars...{\r}

916
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:21,982
...火焰噴射器，任何東西
{\fs12}...flamethrowers, anything.{\r}

917
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:25,404
告訴他們如果我不能發送新聞，我開槍自戕
{\fs12}Tell them if I don't send a story, I'm gonna shoot myself.{\r}

918
01:06:25,573 --> 01:06:28,493
-先去梳頭吧        -哪還有頭髮？
{\fs12}-Better comb your hair first.   -What hair?{\r}

919
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,413
-嘿，再說一次   -哦，妮基，不會你也
{\fs12}-Hey, say that again.   -Oh, Nikki, not you too.{\r}

920
01:06:31,623 --> 01:06:32,956
-他很敏感          -你也是
{\fs12}-He's sensitive.    -You too.{\r}

921
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:35,211
-我有頭髮      -那不會讓你更漂亮
{\fs12}-I got hair.    -Doesn't make you prettier.{\r}

922
01:06:35,377 --> 01:06:37,254
不，你的呼氣(口臭)      -對不起
{\fs12}-No, your breath.   -I'm sorry.{\r}

923
01:06:37,422 --> 01:06:40,050
-他對此也很敏感      -我很沮喪
{\fs12}-He's sensitive about that too.   -I've been upset.{\r}

924
01:06:40,219 --> 01:06:45,308
-傻瓜。瞧，我是說這個   -嘿，你也是
{\fs12}-You ninnies. Look. That's what I mean.  -Hey, look. You too.{\r}

925
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,104
-變冷了       -一定是暖氣被關掉了
{\fs12}-It's getting cold.   -The heat must be off.{\r}

926
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:49,647
被關閉了
{\fs12}It is off.{\r}

927
01:06:50,776 --> 01:06:53,821
沒油了。看看大廳那邊是否一樣
{\fs12}It's not getting oil. See if it's the same across the hall.{\r}

928
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:58,076
-特克斯，電暖器從哪裡供油？ -正後方，外面
{\fs12}-Tex, where do these heaters get oil?
-Around behind. Outside.{\r}

929
01:06:59,787 --> 01:07:02,123
-帕特，食堂裡暖氣也關了！    -不
{\fs12}-Pat, heat's off in the mess hall!    -No.{\r}

-油箱空了嗎？     -前天才填滿
{\fs12}-Could the tank be empty?   -Filled day before yesterday.{\r}

932
01:07:08,008 --> 01:07:10,636
主管線被關了，最好去修理一下
{\fs12}The main line could be plugged. Better fix it.{\r}

933
01:07:10,803 --> 01:07:13,389
可能會撞上我們的訪客，他正等著你
{\fs12}Probably run into our visitor, who'd be waiting for you.{\r}

934
01:07:13,558 --> 01:07:15,183
我們低估了這傢伙
{\fs12}We underestimate this guy.{\r}

935
01:07:15,352 --> 01:07:17,855
-試圖凍僵我們，對吧？    -那並不難
{\fs12}-Trying to freeze us out, huh?  -That isn't gonna be hard.{\r}

936
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,607
-降到了40度     -外面零下60
{\fs12}-It's down to 40 degrees.   -It's 60 below outside.{\r}

937
01:07:20,776 --> 01:07:23,112
-這些房間能保溫多久？    -半小時
{\fs12}-How long will these rooms hold heat?   -Half an hour.{\r}

938
01:07:23,321 --> 01:07:25,824
-那時我們就僵硬了   -如果沒人出去...
{\fs12}-By then, we'll be stiff.   -If no one goes out...{\r}

939
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:27,868
...它不會想到其他招式嗎？
{\fs12}...won't it think of something else?{\r}

940
01:07:28,035 --> 01:07:33,250
它會想到我們只能靠電力保暖。加熱器，電毯
{\fs12}It'll think that our only chance to keep warm is electricity. Heaters, blankets.{\r}

941
01:07:33,419 --> 01:07:36,589
它可以破壞電路，切斷電線，除了源頭之外
{\fs12}It could break the circuit, cut a line, except at the source.{\r}

942
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:38,591
-發電機房      -把大家都帶去那裡
{\fs12}-The generator room.    -Get them all in there.{\r}

943
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,430
-我去告訴特克斯   -帶食物，藥品，毯子，衣服
{\fs12}-I'll tell Tex.   -Bring food, medicine, blankets, clothes.{\r}

944
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:47,145
-帶上我們的飛行服
-大部分都燒了，我看看能救回多少
{\fs12}-Bring our flying clothes.
-Most got burned. I'll see what I can salvage.{\r}

945
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:49,816
-把變壓器連接上      -這裡真冷
{\fs12}-Get the transformer hooked up to that.   -It's cold in here.{\r}

946
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:51,735
-那東西把暖氣關了        -什麼？
{\fs12}-The thing's turned the heat off.   -What?{\r}

947
01:07:51,903 --> 01:07:53,487
-我們怎麼辦？       -我不知道
{\fs12}-What'll we do?     -I don't know.{\r}

948
01:07:53,655 --> 01:07:57,410
接下來就是斷電，所以每個人都在發電機房
{\fs12}The next thing's electricity, so everybody's in the generator room.{\r}

949
01:07:57,578 --> 01:07:59,747
外門的防禦工事 你做得還好吧？
{\fs12}Did you do a good job on the outside door?{\r}

950
01:07:59,955 --> 01:08:02,875
-胡迪尼也會知難而退    -他會由此進入
{\fs12}-Houdini'd find it tough getting in.   -He'll come through here.{\r}

951
01:08:03,044 --> 01:08:06,339
這是唯一的通道；有能承受這種電壓的電纜嗎？
{\fs12}It's the only way. Got any fence wire strong enough for the voltage?{\r}

952
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:08,510
-有一整卷          -這個可行
{\fs12}-Whole rolls of it.    -That'll work.{\r}

953
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:10,219
-什麼？       -鋪在地上
{\fs12}-What?      -Lay it on the ground.{\r}

954
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:13,641
一個在頭頂 還有每邊一個
當它到了定點，就電擊它
{\fs12}A lead overhead and on each side.
When it gets to the spot, juice him.{\r}

955
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:15,268
-我聽不懂          -電線在哪裡？
{\fs12}-I don't get you.    -Where's the wire?{\r}

956
01:08:15,479 --> 01:08:16,562
-下面這裡        -那些給我
{\fs12}-Down here.    -Give me those.{\r}

957
01:08:16,771 --> 01:08:20,108
-你在做什麼？ -給他安裝一個電動捕蠅器
{\fs12}-What are you doing?   -We'll rig an electric flytrap for him.{\r}

958
01:08:20,276 --> 01:08:21,276
怎麼說？
{\fs12}What do you mean?{\r}

959
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:23,823
-史考特，給我一把錘子和釘子  -當然
{\fs12}-Scotty, get me a hammer and nails.   -Sure.{\r}

960
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,741
最好讓開
{\fs12}Better get out of the way.{\r}

961
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:31,040
-似乎胸有成竹  -我已經使出渾身解數了
{\fs12}-Looks as if the situation's well in hand.
-I've given all the orders I'm gonna give.{\r}

962
01:08:31,209 --> 01:08:34,629
如果我的想像是真的，我會向你求婚
這是你的外套
{\fs12}If I thought that were true, I'd ask you to marry me. Here's your coat.{\r}

963
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:36,172
我想保持開放的態度
{\fs12}I wanna keep my mind open.{\r}

964
01:08:36,341 --> 01:08:37,967
-鐵錘和釘子          -在下面
{\fs12}-Hammer and nails.    -Down there.{\r}

965
01:08:38,136 --> 01:08:41,722
-要我們做什麼？   -在發電機房，向前走
{\fs12}-Where do you want us?   -In the generator room. Move along.{\r}

966
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:45,561
-抱歉，我改變主意了，全取消了 -大夥兒繼續走
{\fs12}-Sorry, changed my mind. It's all off.   -Keep moving, everybody.{\r}

967
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:49,024
-我想和你再談一下  -沒時間了，走吧
{\fs12}-I want another word with you.  -No time now. Move along.{\r}

968
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:52,530
讓路。清場，把這地方空出來
{\fs12}Make way. Clear this out. Clear this place.{\r}

969
01:08:52,698 --> 01:08:54,240
-剪子在哪裡？        -這裡
{\fs12}-Where are those cutters?    -Here.{\r}

970
01:08:54,408 --> 01:08:56,785
-你的蓋格偵測器呢？     -我也有一個
{\fs12}-Where's your Geiger counter?    -I got one too.{\r}

971
01:08:56,996 --> 01:08:59,248
去會議室。如果找到任何東西，用跑的來
{\fs12}Go to the assembly room. If you get anything, come running.{\r}

972
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:02,042
-給我一雙手套       -用我的
{\fs12}-Get me a pair of gloves.   -Use mine.{\r}

973
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:23,531
-預留要勾住頭頂的線的空間   -還很空
{\fs12}-Leave enough to hook the overhead wire.   -Got plenty.{\r}

974
01:09:27,537 --> 01:09:31,542
-在這裡，中尉   -這樣我們就有立足之地了
{\fs12}-Here we are, lieutenant.
-Yeah, that ought to give us a ground.{\r}

975
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:35,005
-沒錯，隊長      -現在降到五度了
{\fs12}-There she is, captain.   -Down to five degrees now.{\r}

976
01:09:35,173 --> 01:09:37,967
-很適合滑雪    -史考特，最好穿上膠鞋
{\fs12}-Perfect for skiing.   -Better get rubber boots, Scotty.{\r}

977
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:40,597
-為什麼？     -電力開啟時可以絕緣
{\fs12}-Why?    -Insulation when they turn the juice on.{\r}

978
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:42,724
-對耶            -這裡有一雙
{\fs12}-Oh, yeah.   -There's a pair back here.{\r}

979
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:45,061
-哪裡？        -別忙，你不必穿
{\fs12}-Where?    -Wait. You won't need any boots.{\r}

980
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,982
它到來時，去後面。這裡沒你的事
{\fs12}When it comes, go back. You don't belong out here.{\r}

981
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:52,239
我不想參戰，我只想隔岸觀火
{\fs12}I didn't belong at Alamein or Okinawa. I was just kibitzing.{\r}

982
01:09:52,405 --> 01:09:56,202
訃聞我也寫的不錯，請忽視我的存在
{\fs12}I also write a very good obituary. Just ignore me, please.{\r}

983
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,413
-亨德利隊長         -請說
{\fs12}-Capt. Hendry.    -Go ahead.{\r}

984
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:00,959
這個掛上去吧，看看是否合適
{\fs12}Just hooked this up. Checking if it works.{\r}

985
01:10:01,168 --> 01:10:02,794
很好，注意蓋革偵測器
{\fs12}Fine. Watch your Geiger counter.{\r}

986
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:06,049
-麥克，聽得到嗎？  -字字清晰，希望沒漏掉
{\fs12}-Mac, did you hear?   -Every word. I hope that's all I hear.{\r}

987
01:10:06,217 --> 01:10:09,637
-我也是    -華盛頓發來了另一則訊息
{\fs12}-So do I.   -Here's another message from Washington.{\r}

988
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:15,396
"盡全力維護生命，但別對你的囚犯採取任何措施"
{\fs12}"Use every means to protect lives, but take no steps against your prisoner."{\r}

989
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:16,939
我們的囚犯
{\fs12}Our prisoner.{\r}

990
01:10:17,108 --> 01:10:20,946
-你不能無視命令  -去軍事法庭指證吧
{\fs12}-You can't ignore orders.  -Testify to that at my court-martial.{\r}

991
01:10:21,156 --> 01:10:25,077
你在掠奪科學 史無前例的最大秘密
{\fs12}You're robbing science of the greatest secret that's ever come to it.{\r}

992
01:10:25,244 --> 01:10:28,122
-回去吧       -知識比生命更重要
{\fs12}-Go back.   -Knowledge is more important than life.{\r}

993
01:10:28,248 --> 01:10:31,710
我們生存的唯一理由。去思考，去發掘，去學習
{\fs12}We've only one excuse for existing. To think. To find out. To learn.{\r}

994
01:10:31,878 --> 01:10:34,589
除了怎麼死之外，能從中學到什麼？
{\fs12}What can we learn from that, except a way to die?{\r}

995
01:10:34,799 --> 01:10:38,344
發生了什麼並不重要
除了我們的思想，其他都不足掛齒
{\fs12}It doesn't matter what happens.
Nothing counts except our thinking.{\r}

996
01:10:38,513 --> 01:10:41,099
我們與自然搏鬥，我們分裂原子...
{\fs12}We fought into nature. We've split the atom...{\r}

997
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:43,518
這確實讓世界感到幸福，不是嗎？
{\fs12}That sure made the world happy. Didn't it?{\r}

998
01:10:43,687 --> 01:10:46,940
我們在此從容赴義 也沒去破壞智慧之源...
{\fs12}We owe it to the brain of our species to stand here and die...{\r}

999
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:50,237
...乃為全人類的大腦盡義務  -亨德利隊長
{\fs12}...without destroying a source of wisdom.   -Capt. Hendry.{\r}

1000
01:10:50,404 --> 01:10:52,990
-文明已對我們下了命令    -帶他離開
{\fs12}-Civilization has given us orders.   -Get him out of here.{\r}

1001
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,495
哦，你們這些笨蛋。你不可能傷害它
{\fs12}Oh, you fools. You'll never hurt it.{\r}

1002
01:10:55,662 --> 01:10:58,957
-繼續       -蓋革偵測器有反應了
{\fs12}-Go ahead.   -I'm getting a Geiger counter reaction.{\r}

1003
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:01,628
-讀數多少？      -點二，但很穩定
{\fs12}-What's your reading?   -Point two, but steady.{\r}

1004
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:04,757
盯住，有變化就告訴我們
麥克，你那邊有狀況嗎？
{\fs12}Watch it. Tell us any change. Mac, anything your way?{\r}

1005
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:06,426
-一點微光也沒有         -留意
{\fs12}-Not a glimmer.     -Watch it.{\r}

1006
01:11:06,594 --> 01:11:08,345
這是操作開關
{\fs12}Here's the operating switch.{\r}

1007
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:12,435
-怎麼冷的這麼快？   -繼續四處走動
{\fs12}-How can it get cold so quick?   -Keep moving around.{\r}

1008
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:16,273
-應該是零度
-現在更低。下一站，零下五度
{\fs12}-It must be zero.   -It was. Next stop, five below.{\r}

1009
01:11:16,483 --> 01:11:20,571
來吧，火星先生，來拿點優良的蘇格蘭血液吧
百分之百保證精純
{\fs12}Come on, Mr. Martian, and get some nice Scotch blood. One hundred proof.{\r}

1010
01:11:20,739 --> 01:11:24,159
-給嬰兒喝再好不過了     -叫他別鬧了
{\fs12}-Nothing like it for babies.   -Tell him to cut it out.{\r}

1011
01:11:24,327 --> 01:11:28,958
不，不。讓他繼續，我喜歡起雞皮疙瘩
這會給我溫暖
{\fs12}No, no. Let him go on. I like goose pimples. They keep me warm.{\r}

1012
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,421
那東西著火時 你有沒有拍下照片？
{\fs12}Did you get a picture of that thing on fire?{\r}

1013
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:35,801
不，我向後倒在床上時拍了一張
{\fs12}No. I shot one while I was falling backward over the bed.{\r}

1014
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,180
可能只有天花板 和我的大腳丫
{\fs12}Probably got the ceiling and my big feet.{\r}

1015
01:11:38,348 --> 01:11:41,268
亨德利隊長，有上升一些。現在零點四
{\fs12}Capt. Hendry, going up a little. Point four now.{\r}

1016
01:11:41,434 --> 01:11:45,189
-等等...麥克，有變化嗎？ -沒變，只是更冷
{\fs12}-Hang on. Mac, any change?   -Just the same. Only colder.{\r}

1017
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:49,404
-表示他會經過食堂  -抱歉，我有個主意
{\fs12}-Means he's coming by the mess hall.  -Excuse me. I got an idea.{\r}

1018
01:11:49,613 --> 01:11:50,905
什麼？再討論看看
{\fs12}What? Here we go again.{\r}

1019
01:11:51,116 --> 01:11:55,079
那小子很聰明。他見到這些電線會有疑慮
{\fs12}Your boy's pretty smart. He might see these wires and think it over.{\r}

1020
01:11:55,289 --> 01:11:58,625
-是啊   -如果他遲疑太久，我們就死定了
{\fs12}-Yeah.   -If he thinks too long, we're cold meat.{\r}

1021
01:11:58,793 --> 01:12:02,631
-假如我們去交會口那兒堵他呢？ 
-讓他看見我們來追我們？
{\fs12}-What if we met him by the junction?
-Let him see us there and chase us?{\r}

1022
01:12:02,799 --> 01:12:04,508
光線越少越好
{\fs12}The less light, the better.{\r}

1023
01:12:04,676 --> 01:12:08,221
關掉這裡和那裡的燈。別說我是對的
{\fs12}Turn off this light and this one here. Don't tell me I'm right.{\r}

1024
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,059
亨德利隊長，上升了。現在零點八
{\fs12}Capt. Hendry, going up. Point eight now.{\r}

1025
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:13,563
-我也有讀數了     -它在這裡現身了
{\fs12}-I'm getting some too.    -It's showing here.{\r}

1026
01:12:13,731 --> 01:12:17,067
你們兩個快跑回來      -在半路了
{\fs12}-Both of you, back here. Come running.   -Halfway there.{\r}

1027
01:12:17,236 --> 01:12:20,031
如果加速那台發電機，有更多電力輸出嗎？
{\fs12}If you speed up that generator, can you get more out?{\r}

1028
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:23,827
-試試無妨   -比爾和特克斯跟他去。妮基也去
{\fs12}-Certainly do no harm to try.
-Bill and Tex, go with him. Nikki too.{\r}

1029
01:12:23,995 --> 01:12:26,080
-不行         -祝你好運
{\fs12}-No.     -Good luck to you.{\r}

1030
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,626
怎麼了？
{\fs12}What's the matter?{\r}

1031
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:32,758
-希望我們有測試過  -如果電壓不足怎麼辦？
{\fs12}-I was wishing we'd tested this thing.
-What if we haven't enough voltage?{\r}

1032
01:12:32,925 --> 01:12:34,800
-在它的雙臂維持擺動*    -一點二
{\fs12}-Keep swinging at its arms.   -One point two.{\r}

1033
01:12:34,969 --> 01:12:36,762
-它正在走來            -我很擔心
{\fs12}-It's on its way.   -I got a worry.{\r}

1034
01:12:36,972 --> 01:12:39,558
前線傳來報告，麥克弗森有個隱憂
{\fs12}Report from the front, McPherson has a worry.{\r}

1035
