1
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,415
-Hi, Eddie.
-Hiya, Scotty.

2
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,079
-Cold enough for you?
-Well, I`m only faintly alive. It`s 25 below.

3
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,657
-You know everybody?
-We haven`t met.

4
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,828
-McPherson.
-Hi.

5
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,553
Ned Scott, Capt. Hendry.
Scotty just got in today.

6
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,856
Hi, care to join us?

7
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,694
Wait till I count my fingers.
I may have lost one.

8
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:20,339
Scotty`s a warm-weather man. We met
at Accra. Quite a spot. 1 05 in the shade...

9
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,770
...and the women hardly wore
anything at all. Very intelligent of them.

10
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,945
You just lie there in a hammock
while three of them fan you.

11
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,774
-Remember, Scotty?
-I remember.

12
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,509
-Oh, boy. When I die I hope I go to Accra.
-I was there.

13
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,686
I`m in.

14
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,617
-What are you doing here, Mr. Scott?
-Looking for a story.

15
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,222
Scotty`s a newspaperman.

16
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,051
-How many?
-Three.

17
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,522
-Cards?
-I`ll play these.

18
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,130
-Caught from ambush.
-Check.

19
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,726
-Well, I`ll bet a buck.
-And I`ll fold.

20
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:51,926
Call.

21
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,640
-Pair of queens.
-I thought so. Aces.

22
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,502
You ought to know better than to try
fooling our captain. Only dames can do that.

23
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,679
-Lt. Dykes, I promise--
-Slip of the tongue.

24
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,317
-What do you hear from the general?
-Fogarty`s nursing secrets like a June bride.

25
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,612
I got an idea. A guy in Seattle
knows a whole radar defense story...

26
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,413
...loves to talk.
General McLaren.

27
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,320
Tell General Fogarty you want to go
to Seattle, and Pat and I will fly you there.

28
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,789
I met General McLaren too.

29
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,431
It`s warm in Seattle. They got girls
there without fur pants on.

30
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,793
-What about it, captain?
-That could be right.

31
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,936
You won`t be able to shoo our captain
southward with his heart...

32
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,231
-...wrapped around the North Pole.
-That`ll do.

33
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,442
-What`s going on up there?
-Scientists are holding a convention.

34
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,373
-Looking for polar bear tails.
-Ever hear of Dr. Carrington?

35
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,377
-The fellow who was at Bikini?
-The same.

36
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,346
They`re holding about 2000 miles
north of here. A whole bunch.

37
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,281
-Botanists, physicists, electronic--
-Including a pin-up girl.

38
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,148
-Very interesting type too.
-Very.

39
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,517
Capt. Hendry can give
you any data on her.

40
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,421
-You probably shouldn`t have said that.
-Well, after I read--

41
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,822
Now look!

42
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,022
Someday I hope to have a navigator and a
copilot who are at least dry behind the ears.

43
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,099
-Oh, captain.
-You mail-order--

44
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:00,068
Capt. Hendry, report to General Fogarty`s
quarters at once please.

45
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,475
8:00 at night and the general yelling
for his troops. Sounds like the old days.

46
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,201
-Take my hand. Will you?
-Yeah.

47
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,813
Captain, if it amounts to anything,
bring me in on it. Will you, please?

48
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,483
Sure.

49
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,448
I gotta get a story someplace.

50
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,157
Come in.

51
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,921
-Close the door.
-Yes, sir.

52
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,359
-Good evening, sir.
-Didn`t take you long.

53
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,969
Not many places to hide, sir.

54
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:36,642
Just got a queer message from your picnic
party up north, from Dr. Carrington himself.

55
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,277
``Believe an airplane unusual type
crashed in our vicinity.

56
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,175
Please send facilities to investigate.
Most urgent.``

57
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,147
What would you find up there
besides a good-looking girl?

58
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,286
-I don`t know, sir. Any ships missing?
-No.

59
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,422
-No Canadians either.
-Could be Russians.

60
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,148
-They`re all over the pole like flies.
-You`re going.

61
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,886
Take along a dog team or anything
you might need for rescue.

62
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,222
Come in.

63
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,925
Close the door!

64
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,364
You suppose the Pentagon
could send us a revolving door?

65
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,129
Could be, sir. We got pith helmets
last week.

66
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,237
-Weather report, sir.
-Okay, that`s all.

67
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,468
If any messages come in from Dr. Carrington,
I want to be notified personally.

68
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,407
-No matter what the time.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,809
Here`s your weather.
There`s a front moving in...

70
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,211
...but you ought to have time
to get there and back.

71
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,887
-General, that newspaperman, Scott....
-What about him?

72
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,989
-He`d like to go with us.
-It`s all right if you maroon him up there.

73
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,455
Don`t get me wrong
about who gets marooned.

74
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,288
I`d like it if you didn`t smash
into the landing ski this time.

75
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,054
That was an unavoidable accident.

76
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,358
Well, look, I`ll expect you back
tomorrow night.

77
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,059
-Yes, sir. And I`ll close the door.
-Just tell me what you find up there.

78
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,001
No one tells me anything around here.

79
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,083
Want some coffee?

80
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,349
-Hey, thanks.
-Here you are, sir.

81
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,064
Mr. Scott. Coffee.

82
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,239
-Are we there?
-No, sir. Hot coffee up front, sir.

83
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,570
-Lieutenant? Coffee, sir.
-Thank you, stewardess.

84
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,539
-Coffee?
-Yeah, thanks.

85
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,250
How far are we from camp?

86
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,921
Three hours. We`ve slowed down.
A little headwind.

87
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,058
A little headwind?
Close to 40 miles.

88
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,727
Our captain has some funny ideas
about the North Pole.

89
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,522
He thinks it`s a garden spot.
Come and bring the kiddies.

90
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,562
Now look, don`t you two guys start.

91
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:45,397
You know, Perry went to the North Pole
once. He retired with a sack full of medals.

92
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,637
Hey, Pat.

93
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,603
We go there every three weeks
just like it was lover`s lane.

94
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,675
Mr. Scott, some people
seem to think-- Wait a minute.

95
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,816
Hello, Air Force 1 91 from
Polar Expedition 6. Can you read me?

96
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,850
Air Force 1 91. Hear you fine, Tex.
Go ahead.

97
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,715
-What`s your position?
-Three hours out.

98
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,654
Captain, switch over to your radio compass.
Check it against your magnetic heading.

99
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,955
What`s on your mind, Tex?

100
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,530
We`ve got some disturbance up here.
It`s whacking away at everything.

101
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,998
-What do you figure it`s from?
-Don`t know. We noticed it last night.

102
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,399
-Six to eight degrees difference.
-We`re quite a bit off here, Tex.

103
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,767
You better home in on me.
I`ll leave the key open.

104
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,308
-Or would you rather have me sing to you?
-Leave the key open.

105
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,946
I was afraid you`d say that.

106
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,958
Hey, the taxpayers ought to see this.

107
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,684
Hello, doctor, professor.

108
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,257
-Still the same game?
-Yes.

109
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,757
Hello, boys.

110
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:27,228
-Doctor, professor. Here`s your mail.
-You`re just in time for lunch.

111
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,191
-Ken, I bet you forgot my hairpins.
-Don`t tell me I`m nearly at the North Pole.

112
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,964
-Looks more like my Kentucky home.
-Mr. Scott, Mrs. Chapman.

113
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,606
-A pleasure, Mrs. Chapman.
-Hi, nice to see you.

114
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,936
-Dr. Chapman, Mr. Scott.
-Dr. Chapman.

115
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,840
-Scotty`s a newspaperman.
-You`ve come at an opportune time.

116
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,882
I happened to be in Anchorage when your
message came. I hope you have a good story.

117
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,280
-No more than you know already.
-Nothing more at all?

118
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,581
Just discussions as to what it might be.
We all have different ideas.

119
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,191
-There`s been arguments about it.
-Where`s Dr. Carrington?

120
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,655
-In the lab.
-See you later.

121
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,658
Does that mean you`ve seen the plane?

122
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,160
-Coffee, captain?
-No, thanks.

123
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,060
Our captain seems in a hurry, Lee.

124
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,132
-Where are you two going?
-We`re with you.

125
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,032
-We want to tell her she treated you badly.
-If you don`t want us to go--

126
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,208
-I`m gonna get even with you two someday.
-We got up in there.

127
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,543
Come in.

128
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,117
Hi, Pat. Welcome to our igloo.
How was your--?

129
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,449
Well....

130
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,764
-How was your trip?
-All right. About usual.

131
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,425
Well, that`s fine.

132
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,695
-I think Dr. Carrington wants to see you.
-He can wait. I wanna talk to you.

133
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,906
-What about?
-That was a dirty trick you played.

134
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,166
-Don`t lose your temper.
-Why did you do it? Just tell me why.

135
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,605
Well, your legs aren`t very pretty.

136
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,804
You didn`t have to write a note
and put it on my chest.

137
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:50,948
I`m sorry, Pat--

138
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,277
Six people read it before I woke up.
Now the whole Air Force knows.

139
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,682
-Not so loud. They`ll hear.
-They already heard.

140
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,823
The only place it hasn`t been
is on a billboard.

141
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,586
I didn`t know you had
such a nasty temper.

142
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,286
Now, Pat, just be careful.
Now take it easy.

143
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,227
Now wait a minute.

144
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,965
We had a lot of fun
when you were up here.

145
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,104
Then when you asked me down
to Anchorage, you deliberately fed me--

146
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,466
Tell me, did you really drink
all those drinks?

147
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,074
-You didn`t throw any away? Not one?
-No.

148
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,574
Holy cat. I thought I was good.

149
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,714
And another thing, why did you leave?

150
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,882
When I woke up in the morning
you were gone.

151
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,484
I told you I had to take
that cargo plane back here.

152
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,314
-You told me?
-Don`t you remember?

153
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,046
No.

154
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,823
Right after dinner. You were telling
me all about a night in San Francisco--

155
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,655
Did I tell you that?

156
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,130
What else did I do?

157
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,700
Well, you had moments
of kind of making like an octopus.

158
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,931
-I never saw so many hands in all my life.
-All right. All right.

159
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,801
Look, my only excuse
is that I liked you...

160
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,707
...right away.

161
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,907
-So I started wrong. Can`t we begin again?
-How would you begin?

162
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,452
-Well, I can think of several--
-Never mind.

163
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,849
We don`t have time for that now anyway.

164
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,685
I know Dr. Carrington`s waiting
to see you.

165
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,626
-What about this business of starting over?
-We`ll talk about that later.

166
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,338
-Hello, captain.
-Hi, professor.

167
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,415
-Dr. Carrington, Capt. Hendry is here.
-Yes, I know.

168
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,420
-How do you do, captain?
-Doctor.

169
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,990
Miss Nicholson, would you add
a note to the others?

170
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,252
Surely.

171
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:47,489
November 2, 11:30 a.m.

172
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:52,636
Deviation in sector 19 continues
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.

173
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:56,365
No lessening or wavering
of disturbing element.

174
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,076
That`s all.

175
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,878
-Captain, can we start now?
-Mind telling me where we`re going?

176
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,343
48 miles due east from here.

177
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,779
Your message said an airplane crashed.
Is that what we`re looking for?

178
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,010
I don`t know, captain.

179
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,120
-I think you better explain.
-I`m sorry.

180
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,052
Miss Nicholson, would you read
Capt. Hendry my first notes?

181
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,662
I was thinking only of the vagueness
of my information. I dislike being vague.

182
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,592
-``November 1 st...
-Yesterday.

183
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,793
...6:15 p.m. Sound detectors and
seismographs registered explosion due east.

184
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,997
At 6:18, magnetometer revealed deviation
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.``

185
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,438
-That deviation has been constant.
-We ran into it before we got here.

186
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,580
``Such deviation possible only
if a disturbing force equivalent...

187
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:39,114
-...to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore...
-20,000 tons?

188
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,185
...had become part of the earth
at about a 50-mile radius.``

189
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,948
You`re getting a bit beyond me,
but it sounds like a meteor.

190
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,887
Yes, very much. Except for one thing.

191
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,687
-Will, show it to Capt. Hendry.
-Yes, sir.

192
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,922
We have some special telescopic cameras.

193
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,125
On the appearance of radioactivity,
a Geiger counter trips the release...

194
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,963
...and the cameras function.

195
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,629
They were working last evening.
This is the result.

196
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,012
This first picture was taken
three minutes before the explosion...

197
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,306
...or 6:1 2.

198
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,349
You can see the small dot
below there in the corner.

199
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,483
On the next picture, one minute later,
that dot is moving from west to east...

200
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,421
-...fast enough to form a streak.
-What shutter speed is it?

201
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,653
-1000th of a second.
-Moving pretty fast. Wasn`t it?

202
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,730
Here, at 6:1 4, it`s moving upward.

203
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,037
6:1 5, it drops to the earth
and vanishes.

204
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,376
A meteor might move almost horizontal
to the earth but never upward.

205
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,442
-Then it isn`t a meteor.
-That`s obvious.

206
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,477
How`d you find the distance of impact?

207
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,512
-By computation--
-Dr. Carrington?

208
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,878
-Ready?
-It`s quite simple, captain.

209
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,647
We have the time of arrival
of the sound waves and detectors.

210
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,292
And also the arrival time
of the impact waves on the seismograph.

211
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:58,987
By computing the difference, it becomes
obvious they were caused by the object.

212
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,463
-The distance from here is 48 miles.
-I`ll take your word for it.

213
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,661
One thing, doctor. 20,000 tons of steel
is a lot of metal for an airplane.

214
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,932
It is for the sort of airplane
we know, captain.

215
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,244
-Yeah, we`d better be going.
-Redding will check every quarter-hour.

216
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,176
-Will you want me, doctor?
-It won`t be necessary.

217
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,182
-You come with us, Bill.
-Yes, doctor.

218
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,599
We`ll be there pretty soon now, Pat.

219
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,698
Bob, get Carrington up here.

220
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,834
Doctor!

221
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,409
We`re almost 50 miles out, doctor.

222
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,379
With your compass deviation,
how are you navigating, captain?

223
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,814
That peak ahead is practically due east.

224
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,783
We got the wind before we left camp.

225
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,822
-Very good, captain.
-We should be there about now, Pat.

226
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:04,553
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

227
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,129
Picking up something
on the Geiger counter, sir.

228
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:11,497
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

229
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,034
Look there.

230
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,275
-Pat, the compass is in a spin.
-Geiger`s up to the top.

231
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,173
Yeah, that`s it, all right.

232
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,586
-You see someplace to set down?
-Looked smooth about a half a mile back.

233
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,190
We`ll take a look. Bob!
Get them ready. lt might be rough.

234
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,621
Right, sir.

235
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,422
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
We`re gonna land.

236
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,928
Sit down and hold on back there.

237
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,337
All set for landing, sir.

238
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,973
Half flaps.

239
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,411
-Full rich.
-Full rich.

240
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,607
Half flaps.

241
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,864
There we are.

242
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,699
Holy cat! What a weird-looking thing.

243
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,465
Let me get a picture
before you track up the whole place.

244
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,267
This Geiger counter is going crazy.

245
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,810
Something`s melted that surface crust.
It`s frozen over again into clear ice.

246
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,314
The bottle shape apparently was caused
by the craft first making contact...

247
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,486
...with the earth out
at the neck of the bottle...

248
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,145
...sliding toward us and forming
that larger area as it came to rest.

249
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:16,987
With the engines generating enough heat
to melt that path through the crust...

250
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,596
-...then sink beneath the surface.
-What could melt that much ice?

251
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,629
Let`s go down and see. Barnes.

252
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,828
Take the dogs over on that side.

253
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,607
Dr. Chapman, could an airplane
melt that much ice?

254
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:42,344
One of our own jets generates enough heat
to warm a 50-story office building.

255
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,169
-It`s part of an airfoil. Probably a stabilizer.
-It`s an airplane, all right.

256
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,964
-Can you tell what metal that is?
-I`ll need some tools.

257
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,436
Barnes, bring some tools!

258
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:11,038
Hey, it`s down pretty deep over here.
I can`t see anything but a dark mass.

259
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,342
It`s deeper over here.

260
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,817
Captain, may I suggest that we spread out
and try to determine the size and shape.

261
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:21,288
Right. Spread out, everybody! We`re gonna
try to figure out the shape of this thing.

262
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,390
Here`s the tools, sir.

263
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,940
Holy cat!

264
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,510
Hey....

265
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,344
It`s almost....

266
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,713
Yeah. Almost a perfect....

267
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,946
It is. It`s round.

268
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,260
-We finally got one.
-We found a flying saucer!

269
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,758
Can anybody see anything
through the ice?

270
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,193
-Only an outline.
-Nothing but a dark shape.

271
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,663
Seems perfectly smooth.
No doors or windows.

272
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,167
-I can`t see any engine.
-I doubt we find anything we call an engine.

273
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:10,068
Dr. Carrington, this isn`t
any metal I know.

274
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,106
Probably some new alloy.

275
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,542
-Get some filings for analysis.
-Right.

276
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,849
Captain, I don`t think we have a chance
of chopping through the ice with axes.

277
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,044
I know. We think so too.
We`ll try to melt it out with thermite bombs.

278
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,382
-Oh, excellent.
-Where do you figure it`s from?

279
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,751
I don`t know, Mr. Scott.

280
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,586
-Well, from this planet?
-I doubt it.

281
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,490
-Well, do you--?
-The answers will be much easier...

282
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,393
...after we`ve examined the interior
of the aircraft...

283
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,502
-...and its occupants, if there are any.
-Occupants? Why, I never....

284
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,672
What a story!
Where`s the radio? Hey, Barnes!

285
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,431
-Hold it. No private messages.
-What do you mean private?

286
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,610
-I`m sending it to the whole world.
-This is Air Force information.

287
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,745
We`ll have to wait for authority
to let you file it.

288
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:53,247
You got your authority in the Constitution!
It`s called freedom of the press.

289
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,352
-I`m sending a story!
-Not from our ship.

290
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,818
-Where do you want the bombs?
-One by the stabilizer...

291
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,389
...another over in the far side
if we need it.

292
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,062
It`s the biggest story since the parting
of the Red Sea. You can`t hide it!

293
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,788
-Think what it means to the world.
-I don`t work for the world.

294
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,626
-Look--
-No, Scott. I`ll take that.

295
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,031
-Here`s the detonator.
-Get back to the ship and call the camp.

296
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:17,539
Have Tex radio we`ve found a flying saucer
in the ice. We`re gonna try to get it out.

297
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,234
-What about me?
-Also, ask if Scott can send his story.

298
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,846
-That`s all I can do.
-You`re gonna grow up to be another Fogarty.

299
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,847
-Where we gonna touch this off?
-Over there.

300
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,519
Have you looked to the west?
That front`s moving fast...

301
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,747
-...and the temperature`s dropping too.
-We don`t have more than an hour.

302
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,059
-Where do you put those, Bob?
-Right on the surface.

303
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,252
-Tell Stone. Will you, sir?
-Right.

304
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,296
Say, what will this thermite do?

305
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,492
This is S-O-P, standard operating
procedure for removing ice.

306
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,399
Hook this wire up, will you, lieutenant?
It just melts it.

307
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,436
How fast does it work?

308
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,166
It`ll uncover the whole saucer
in 30 seconds.

309
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,311
-All ready over here!
-Be right with you!

310
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:59,678
Better clear the field! Over near the dog
sled! Gonna get pretty hot here in a minute.

311
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,799
Hook her up. We`ll try the stabilizer
first. Use the other one if we need it.

312
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,028
A few minutes from now
we may have the key to the stars.

313
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,299
A million years of history
are waiting for us in that ice.

314
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,875
-Say when. I wanna get a picture.
-All ready, sir.

315
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,639
-Ready here.
-Let her go, Bob.

316
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,753
-Okay, all clear.
-Wait a minute, everybody. Stay back.

317
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,755
-It`s burning under the ice.
-Careful, captain.

318
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,526
What`s happening?

319
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,170
Tell me, doctor.

320
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,569
Get down on the ground, everybody!

321
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,961
Everybody all right?

322
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,392
That last explosion was the engine.

323
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,930
Sergeant, will you try your Geiger counter?

324
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,829
-Only a trace.
-That`s just residual.

325
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,903
It`s all gone.

326
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,608
Secrets that might have
given us a new science.

327
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,174
-Gone.
-That`s just dandy.

328
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,141
Standard operating procedure.

329
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,212
-I should`ve thought....
-You sure should.

330
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,780
Greatest discovery in history up in flames.

331
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,385
Turning a new civilization
into a 4th of July piece.

332
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,425
Captain, I`m getting something
over here.

333
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,324
-Probably a fragment from the saucer.
-We may salvage something yet.

334
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,305
Hold it, everybody.
I`m getting a reaction.

335
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,405
Let me get a reading.

336
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,038
Getting warm.

337
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,776
Hotter now.

338
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,456
Here`s where it`s coming from.

339
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,990
-What is it?
-Looks like a man.

340
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,563
It`s got legs and a head.
I can see them.

341
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,166
Yeah! He must be over 8 feet long.

342
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,495
-Somebody got out of that saucer.
-Or was thrown out.

343
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,605
And frozen fast before he could get clear.

344
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,241
-Man from Mars.
-How do you propose getting him out?

345
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,933
-I don`t know.
-Use more thermite.

346
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,442
Whatever`s quickest.
We don`t have much time.

347
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,139
Here`s axes. You could chop around
and put the block on the plane.

348
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,375
-I agree.
-Get started.

349
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,885
-Give me room.
-Bob, clear the sled and bring it over here.

350
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,080
Eddie, get the ship warmed up.

351
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,021
And be ready to get out
of here in a hurry.

352
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,682
-Pat, I think we made a mistake.
-What do you mean?

353
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,348
You ever read this? ``Department
of Defense, Office of Public lnformation.

354
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,688
Washington, D.C.
December 27, 1 949.

355
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,333
Bulletin 629-49 regarding item 6700...

356
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,662
...extract 75,1 31 .

357
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,601
The Air Force has discontinued investigating
and evaluating reported flying saucers...

358
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,173
...on the basis that there
is no evidence.``

359
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,540
Probably make you a general
for destroying evidence that they`re wrong.

360
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,739
``The Air Force said that all evidence
indicates that the reports...

361
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,145
...of unidentified flying objects
are the result of:

362
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:57,685
One: misinterpretation of various
conventional objects.``

363
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,686
Didn`t look very conventional to me.

364
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,984
``Second: a mild form
of mass hysteria.``

365
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:06,630
That`d be when General Fogarty got
to shaking hands with that thing in the ice.

366
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,265
What are the other reasons?

367
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,901
``Third: that they`re jokes.``

368
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,367
What did you say the number
of that bulletin was?

369
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:20,772
``629-49, item 6700,
extract 75,1 31 .``

370
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,339
Oh. Oh, that one.

371
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,731
-Get on that rope, professor.
-I need a hand over here.

372
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,061
Watch your feet.

373
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,900
Let me tie another rope
to go down.

374
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,802
-Hold it!
-Hold it back now.

375
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,338
Hold it!

376
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,138
Pull, back there!

377
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,609
Keep tight on those ropes!

378
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,082
-Easy.
-Here we go.

379
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,916
-Keep it going.
-Keep it going!

380
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,890
Whoa! Take it easy.

381
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,456
Can`t see through the ice too good.

382
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,158
Good enough to know that where he came
from, they don`t breed them for beauty.

383
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,769
Well, what do we do now, defrost him?

384
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,132
This ice will melt pretty soon.

385
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,741
-Can you control the heat in this room?
-No, captain. This is our storeroom.

386
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,639
The temperature`s constant here.

387
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,246
We don`t need to melt it.
We can chip it away.

388
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,612
We`re not going to melt it
or chip it. Eddie, open that window.

389
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,447
-We`re not allowed to examine it?
-I mean just that.

390
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,885
-This is stupid.
-We`re scientists.

391
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,549
-And Dr. Carrington`s in charge here.
-Hey, Pat, these windows don`t open.

392
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,855
It`s practically certain we`ll be asked
by your superiors to study it.

393
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,932
-Probably, but we can`t permit it now.
-We don`t need permission--

394
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,625
-Eddie, break that window.
-All right.

395
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,830
Sorry. We already pulled one boner
out in the ice.

396
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,634
We may not know anything about this...

397
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,574
...but until I receive instructions from my
superior officer, we`ll have to mark time.

398
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,614
-You have no authority--
-If you want to talk, do it in the corridor.

399
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:44,255
-It`s gonna get cold in here.
-At last a sensible suggestion, captain.

400
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,783
-Mac.
-Yeah?

401
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,516
Please stay here.
And take four-hour shifts.

402
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,719
-It`s hands off for everyone.
-Yes, sir.

403
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,023
-Gonna be warm enough?
-If not, you`ll hear me squawk.

404
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,996
-Bob will bring you dinner.
-I could use something to read.

405
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:02,469
-A nice, quiet horror story.
-Might be kind of tame for you, sir.

406
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,644
-Well, gentlemen?
-Capt. Hendry--

407
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,609
-Excuse me, doctor. May l?
-Certainly.

408
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:13,045
ln relation to removing the body
from the ice, l`d like to point out...

409
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:17,051
...there are organisms that survive
after death, but cold can destroy them.

410
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,745
-In view of that--
-I don`t know--

411
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:24,088
But these organisms may be dangerous. They
may be carrying germs from another planet.

412
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,388
-Germs we couldn`t cope with medically.
-Thank you.

413
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,828
-I can`t agree with you, Dr. Chapman.
-I don`t either.

414
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,059
Here`s another: we don`t know
what effect the air of our Earth...

415
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,434
-...may have on this creature`s remains.
-Sort of go up in smoke, like the saucer?

416
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,335
-Nonsense.
-Isn`t that far-fetched?

417
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,238
-So is a man from Mars.
-We`re getting nowhere.

418
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,314
I suggest that Capt. Hendry communicate
with his superior at once.

419
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,281
I`m getting senile.
We should have done that first thing.

420
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:53,480
I`m surprised, captain, that you didn`t try
to reach your general on our way back here.

421
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,919
We did. Barnes.

422
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,926
I tried through your radio operator.
Couldn`t get through. Too much interference.

423
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,463
-I see. My apologies, captain.
-Yes, doctor.

424
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,563
-Hi, captain.
-Hi, Tex.

425
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,567
You sure stirred up a lot of trouble--

426
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,865
-Did you send out my message?
-Sure did.

427
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,736
-Get an answer back?
-This came an hour ago. Can you read it?

428
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,036
-No, you`d better.
-``Fogarty to Hendry:

429
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,374
Withhold newspaper story
until permission from Air Force HQ.``

430
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,643
-There you are, Scotty.
-Fine. Now somebody else will get the story.

431
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:26,790
``Remove aircraft from ice at once. Use
thermite bombs if necessary to melt ice.``

432
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:31,052
Oh, that`s what I like about the Army.
Smart all the way to the top.

433
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,595
-That lets you off the hook for the thermite--
-Take it easy. Go ahead.

434
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,895
``Erect temporary structure to protect aircraft
until my arrival.``

435
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,231
Here`s another one. Came a few minutes ago.
Could only get part of it.

436
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:45,738
-Go ahead.
-``Everything grounded. Can`t--`` Something.

437
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,811
-``Want you--`` Something or other--
-That sounds like Fogarty.

438
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,072
-Then it got fouled up.
-You`re getting nothing?

439
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:54,251
Nothing. Static`s knocking
it right out of the air.

440
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,478
-What about your stuff?
-Don`t know if they`re getting it. I doubt it.

441
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,748
I don`t believe it.
Even the Pony Express got through.

442
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,085
-Well, doctor?
-ln view of this new situation--

443
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,523
-Doesn`t alter the old one.
-We disagree with you.

444
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,425
-There`s no reason to delay--
-Sorry, gentlemen. That`s it.

445
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,930
Tex, l`d like to leave Barnes
to help out all he can.

446
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,102
-Sure.
-Barnes, keep trying to get through.

447
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,895
I wanna get a message
to the general.

448
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,596
Tell him the aircraft was completely
destroyed by the thermite bomb.

449
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,436
-Tell him we found a passenger--
-A fellow from Mars? Where?

450
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:21,804
On ice, buddy.

451
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,743
Tell him the body`s in ice
and Dr. Carrington wants permission...

452
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,247
...to remove the body
from the ice for examination.

453
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,080
We`re standing by for instructions
before further action.

454
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,312
Yes, sir.

455
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,616
-You got anything to add, doctor?
-Yes, one very essential point.

456
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,590
That it`s vitally important
that the examination be made.

457
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,854
-By all means. Yeah.
-Add that, Barnes.

458
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,760
Thank you, captain.
That`s all that concerns me.

459
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:45,401
When you get your answer,
I expect you to let me know.

460
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,230
Yes, doctor.

461
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,710
Wait till I interview the doctor
about what he thinks of you.

462
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,277
-Probably be good.
-If it isn`t, I`ll make it good.

463
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,611
Tex, keep trying. Barnes, if he gets through,
ask again about clearing Mr. Scott.

464
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,412
Don`t try to soft-soap me.
I don`t like you any better.

465
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,715
-I`ll eat with you, Eddie.
-I`ll send you some chow.

466
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,288
Captain, I`m gonna check the ship
and tie her down. We`ll need our gear.

467
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,827
-This storm may blow for weeks.
-Get the Eskimos to help.

468
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,794
They took off
when they saw that ice.

469
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,092
They`ll need a lot of coaxing
to get them back.

470
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,600
If Mr. Scott and the lieutenant
would give me a hand--

471
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,396
-I`m a guest.
-I`m an officer.

472
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,607
You can order me around
while carrying the other end.

473
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,241
That`ll help a lot, sarge.

474
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,976
You know, Pat? I thought
we were gonna have a little trouble.

475
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,116
-So did l.
-The geniuses were ready to tear you apart.

476
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,879
They`re like kids drooling over
a new fire engine.

477
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,751
Professor Vorhees, come
to the laboratory as soon as possible.

478
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,656
-Holding a meeting. Whole thing`s weird.
-You know what it reminds me of?

479
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,457
The time I was stuck on Beulen lsland
with the old 97th bomber group.

480
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,726
An Army nurse came ashore
and caused the same disturbance...

481
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,030
-...as this guy from Mars has here.
-What happened to the nurse?

482
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,298
She liked it there.

483
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:03,007
-Scotty, what`s new?
-What`s new? What more do you want?

484
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:07,310
Biggest story ever to hit this planet,
and I run into this human clam.

485
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,679
Why are you getting pretty?
You`ll never look good to me.

486
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,684
-That`s not for you--
-Take it easy.

487
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:15,757
The captain here passes the buck to
General Fogarty, he takes it to Washington.

488
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,928
-Who will Truman ask?
-Margaret.

489
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,530
-I`ve got to find a way to get to civilization.
-How, for instance?

490
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:25,567
I don`t know. Pogo sticks. Kiddie cars.
Gondolas. Dogsleds.

491
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:30,207
-Hey, Barnes, any word come from Fogarty?
-Plenty. Nothing about you, sir.

492
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:34,208
I think the old man`s gone crazy.
Sorry, sir. Shouldn`t have said that.

493
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:38,405
-lf he hollers louder, we won`t need a radio.
-What was the gist of the conversation?

494
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:43,849
-There`s been a leak, and the newspapers--
-I knew it! Like water through a sieve.

495
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,717
Everyone wants information,
Congress, Secretary of State...

496
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,484
...and especially General Fogarty.
He`s having a fit.

497
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,685
-Isn`t Anchorage picking us up?
-No, sir.

498
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,626
We`re picking up them
because they have a stronger station.

499
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,734
A picture just came to me:
my editor climbing all over his office...

500
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:03,100
...yelling, stamping his feet.
He`ll probably shoot himself by midnight.

501
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,606
-Take it easy, Scotty.
-Just a minute. I`m not sure you`re ready.

502
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,211
You may have missed a spot.

503
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,780
Son, would you like
double guard duty tonight?

504
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,008
No, sir. I wouldn`t.

505
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,549
-Oh, captain.
-Yes, sergeant?

506
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,587
-Could I see you for a minute, sir?
-Sure.

507
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,031
What is it, Bob?

508
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:32,134
It`s about Lt. McPherson sitting in there
with that thing in the block of ice.

509
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,860
Getting nervous?

510
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,701
Well, he wouldn`t want me to tell you, sir,
but he`s having kittens.

511
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,240
l haven`t heard him squawk like this
since Rechenberg.

512
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,377
Really?

513
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,480
You see, sir, the ice is clearing up,
and we can see that thing pretty good.

514
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:49,744
It`s got crazy hands and no hair,
and the eyes....

515
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,754
-They`re open and look like they can see.
-Bob, I haven`t heard you--

516
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,791
It`s got me too, sir,
and I wasn`t in there very long.

517
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:01,988
Besides that, it`s pretty cold.
I got the lieutenant an electric blanket.

518
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,760
-Captain, I got a suggestion.
-Go ahead.

519
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,870
lnstead of four-hour shifts,
we could cut them in half--

520
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,974
Okay. You tell Barnes to take over
at 2200.

521
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,202
You take over at 2400,
and I`ll relieve you at 0200.

522
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,643
-I think you`re right, sir.
-I think you are.

523
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,647
Thank you, sir.

524
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,930
-I want to talk to you.
-Sure.

525
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,659
Pat, what`s really going on?

526
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,306
Nothing. I just can`t agree with your pals.
I had to set a guard.

527
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,101
They`d have that thing
up waltzing with them.

528
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,776
No, that isn`t what I meant.

529
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,104
What does that boogeyman
in ice really mean?

530
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,247
I don`t know, Nikki.

531
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,443
Well, does it mean that we`ll have visitors
from other planets dropping in on us?

532
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,214
Do we have to return the call, or--?
Oh, jeepers.

533
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:03,154
-I know. Yesterday l`d said it was crazy.
-l`d say it`s crazy now.

534
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,489
Forget it. Tomorrow it`ll all seem different.

535
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,895
I suppose so. I like the way
you handled this whole mess, Pat.

536
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,538
I`d just as soon not.
You know, it`s funny. I`m glad I was here.

537
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,330
I am too.

538
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,303
You`re much nicer when you`re--

539
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,135
When you`re not mad.

540
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:24,371
Sounds promising. How about that
business of beginning over again?

541
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:29,884
Well, I think I`ll buy you a drink this time.
I think you`ve earned it.

542
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,750
-That is, if you want one.
-You can tie my hands if you wanna.

543
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,757
-That might not be such a bad idea.
-You mean that?

544
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,159
-Well, you suggested it.
-All right. I`ll bring a rope.

545
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:55,806
-You want another one, Pat?
-Don`t you think you could untie me now?

546
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,072
I don`t know. What`s the matter?

547
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:02,685
You gals. lf a guy asks you to dinner and
buys you a drink and tries to kiss you--

548
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,082
-Why are you laughing?
-You never kissed me.

549
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,984
-I haven`t tried.
-How do you know?

550
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,991
-Oh, stop bringing that up.
-Never mind. You haven`t. Maybe if you`d--

551
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,129
-Go on with what you were saying.
-What?

552
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,992
About the dinner and the drink.

553
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,032
Well, if the same man asked you
to have 30,000 dinners--

554
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,103
Then he`s not a wolf anymore?
That`s fine philosophy.

555
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:25,935
So you really want your hands untied.
Just when everything was nice and peaceful.

556
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:30,876
You know, I`m glad we decided
to start over again. I like it.

557
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,049
-I like that too.
-Talk about Japanese tortures.

558
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,279
No, not at all. I think this
was a great idea.

559
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,389
Come here.

560
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,420
Well, look at you...

561
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:47,928
...sitting there like a civilized man instead
of grabbing around like a throwback.

562
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,898
lf you weren`t tied up, I wouldn`t dare
have told you how much I liked you.

563
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:57,234
You know, Pat, the trouble with you is that
you don`t know anything about women.

564
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,067
What a woman wants is to....

565
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,073
Is to--

566
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,639
-How long have you been loose?
-Long enough.

567
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,516
It`s been a very interesting evening.
Good night, Miss Nicholson.

568
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:13,986
-Pat, if you walk out on me like this--
-I wouldn`t go, except I gotta check up.

569
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,764
Get a good night`s sleep.

570
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,764
I`ll see you in the morning.

571
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,239
It`s the eyes being open that gets you.
Makes you feel so--

572
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,501
Hi, Pat. Barnes just got here. Sure glad
I`m not looking at that guy anymore.

573
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,109
-All set, Barnes?
-Yes, sir.

574
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,374
-Got an electric flying suit and coffee.
-Bob will relieve you at 2400.

575
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,643
-Take it easy.
-Yeah.

576
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,926
That`s better.

577
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,814
Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry!
Capt. Hendry.

578
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,820
What`s the matter, corporal?

579
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,825
Where`s the captain? l`ve got to tell him
that thing`s alive. I saw it.

580
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,395
It chased me. It`s not dead. It`s--

581
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,196
Capt. Hendry!

582
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,594
That thing`s alive, sir.
I saw it. I shot at it. I hit it, I know it.

583
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:44,935
Nothing happened. lt kept coming at me,
making a noise like a cat meowing.

584
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:50,443
If you could have seen those hands and
those eyes! You`ve got to do something--

585
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,379
Mac, Bob, get some guns.
Now, Barnes, what happened?

586
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:01,354
I`m sorry, sir. I don`t know exactly, but all of
a sudden it was alive and coming at me.

587
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,017
I shot at it and hit it.
Nothing happened, so I ran--

588
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,560
-Easy, easy.
-I`m sorry, sir.

589
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:10,291
-Here, captain.
-Take care of him. Will you?

590
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,438
Get back to sleep.

591
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,139
Get back with the rest of them.

592
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,461
-What could`ve...?
-Kid said he was alive. I believe him.

593
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,360
I knew it. All the time I was here,
I could feel it.

594
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,833
Here`s what did it.
This blanket was on. It`s still warm.

595
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,305
-He got out of here, all right.
-Get parkas, boots and a flashlight!

596
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,246
-Listen. They`ll tear him to pieces.
-We must save him.

597
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:04,512
Hold it, doctor. You`ll freeze to death
in five minutes. Use your head!

598
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:09,091
-I expect you`re right. I was overanxious.
-Look over here, captain!

599
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,067
-I think l`ve got yours.
-May I have one, captain?

600
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,702
Better let us go, doctor.

601
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,142
-Doc, can you see anything out there?
-Not much.

602
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,173
-You all set?
-Let her go.

603
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:39,379
Captain, it would help if you, any of you,
would describe what you saw out there.

604
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,552
It was too cold to see well,
but the dogs had him down.

605
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,189
-He got up with three hanging on his arm.
-He threw one at the rest.

606
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,018
-Two were dead.
-Looked like they`d been through a chopper.

607
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,127
-Where did you find the arm?
-Partly under one of them.

608
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,264
Could dogs tear off an arm?

609
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,094
This kind of an arm.

610
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,739
-Be careful, doctor. Those barbs are sharp.
-Seems to be a sort of chitinous substance.

611
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,940
Speak English.

612
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,075
Something between a beetle`s back
and a rose thorn.

613
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,938
-Thorn-fingered?
-Amazingly strong.

614
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,909
-Very effective as a weapon.
-Very.

615
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,448
We don`t have to worry about that. An arm
off and out in that cold, he`s dead now.

616
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,053
Got along fine in a block of ice
for 24 hours.

617
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,622
-Pretty spry for a guy with 1 2 dogs on him.
-And for losing an arm.

618
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,817
-I`m losing my mind.
-Amazing, isn`t it?

619
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:28,123
-Amazingly strong.
-Strange.

620
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,664
-I`m sure of it.
-That is blood on the hand. lsn`t it?

621
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,394
-Yes, but not his.
-Probably from one of the dogs.

622
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,439
There`s no blood in the arm,
no animal tissue.

623
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:43,306
Dr. Stern, would you have a look at this
under the microscope?

624
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:50,451
No, Mr. Scott. I doubt very much if it
can die, as we understand dying.

625
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:53,919
-Holy cat!
-Yes.

626
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,625
Well, doctor?

627
00:44:55,826 --> 00:45:02,095
No arterial structure indicated.
No nerve endings visible.

628
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,230
Porous, unconnected cellular growth.

629
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:11,841
Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like
you`re trying to describe a vegetable.

630
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,500
-I am. Are you getting all of this?
-Oh, for Pete`s sake!

631
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:20,740
You know, doctor, that could be why
Sgt. Barnes` bullets had no effect.

632
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,886
-That`s right.
-Merely holes drilled into vegetable matter.

633
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,022
This green fluid here.

634
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,021
-Like plant sap.
-We`ll probably find it has a sugar base.

635
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,592
Please, doctor, l`ve got to ask this.

636
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:36,858
It sounds like, well.... Just as though
you`re describing some form of super carrot.

637
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,999
That`s nearly right, Mr. Scott.

638
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:46,336
This carrot, as you call it, has constructed an
aircraft capable of flying millions of miles...

639
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,444
...propelled by a force
as yet unknown to us.

640
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:53,514
-An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles.
-It shouldn`t.

641
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:57,016
Imagine how strange it would have seemed
during the Pliocene age...

642
00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:03,456
...to forecast that worms, fish, lizards that
crawled over the Earth would evolve into us.

643
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,787
On the planet from which our visitor came...

644
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:10,126
...vegetable life underwent an evolution
similar to that of our own animal life...

645
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,531
...which would account
for the superiority of its brain.

646
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:18,606
Its development was not handicapped
by emotional or sexual factors.

647
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,710
Dr. Carrington, you won the Nobel Prize.

648
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,313
You`ve received every kind of kudos
a scientist can attain.

649
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,246
If you were for sale, I could get a million
bucks for you from any foreign government.

650
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:33,549
I`m not, therefore, gonna stick my neck out
and say you`re stuffed full...

651
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:38,217
...of wild blueberry muffins. But I promise
you, my readers are gonna think so.

652
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:43,559
Not for long, Mr. Scott. Not if they know
anything about the flora of their own planet.

653
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:47,464
You mean there are vegetables
right here on Earth that can think?

654
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:52,107
A certain kind of thinking, yes.
You ever hear of the telegraph vine?

655
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,071
-Not recently.
-Or the....

656
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,641
-Is it the acanthus century plant, Dr. Stern?
-Yes.

657
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,713
Go ahead, doctor. That`s your field.

658
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:05,446
Well, the century plant catches mice,
bats, squirrels, any small mammals.

659
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,888
Uses a sweet syrup as bait,
then holds onto its catch and feeds on it.

660
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,288
What`s the telegraph vine?

661
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,523
The vine, research has proven, can signal
to other vines of the same species...

662
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,634
...vines 20 to 1 00 miles away.

663
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,273
Intelligence in plants and vegetables
is an old story, Mr. Scott.

664
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,567
Older even than the animal arrogance
that has overlooked it.

665
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,471
-That`s one for Ripley.
-Look here.

666
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:33,207
I took this from under the soft tissue
in the palm of the hand.

667
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,515
-A seedpod.
-Seedpod?

668
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:41,248
Yes. The neat and unconfused
reproductive technique of vegetation.

669
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,586
No pain or pleasure as we know it.

670
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,786
No emotions...

671
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,294
...no heart.

672
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:53,162
Our superior. Our superior in every way.

673
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,767
Gentlemen, do you realize
what we`ve found?

674
00:47:56,006 --> 00:48:01,034
A being from another world as different
from us as one pole from the other.

675
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,940
If we can only communicate with it...

676
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:08,948
...we can learn secrets that have been
hidden from mankind since the beginning--

677
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:23,297
Holy cat. It`s moving.

678
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,730
-Miss Nicholson.
-Yes, doctor?

679
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:29,929
At 12:1 0 a.m., the hand became alive.

680
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:36,879
The temperature of the forearm
showed a 20-degree rise.

681
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,447
Because of this rise in temperature,
I believe it was able to ingest...

682
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,381
...the canine blood with which
it was covered. I believe--

683
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:48,183
You mean--
You mean it lives on blood.

684
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,194
-This is the best we could find.
-This should work.

685
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,388
-Where are you going?
-To find our visitor, if we can.

686
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,294
One moment, captain!

687
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,329
Check the storeroom again.
Bolt any outside doors.

688
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,937
Captain, when you find
what you`re looking for...

689
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,166
...remember it`s a stranger
in a strange land.

690
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,844
The only crimes were those
committed against it.

691
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,413
lt woke from a block of ice, was attacked
by dogs and shot by a frightened man.

692
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:19,522
-All I want is to communicate with it.
-Fine, provided it`s locked up.

693
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:23,817
If we catch him, let me take his picture
before somebody makes a salad of him.

694
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,359
Sure, Scotty.

695
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,497
-Bob, get up on there.
-What`s up? Looks like a lynching party.

696
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,762
-Have any visitors?
-Not a soul.

697
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:39,567
I got part of a message from the general.
He said to wait on Mr. Scott`s story.

698
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,335
What`s the difference?
Nothing`s going out anyway.

699
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,013
-What are you looking for?
-Couldn`t come in here.

700
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,647
-Who?
-The man from Mars.

701
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,408
You mean he`s alive and loose?

702
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,985
Keep your door locked. Use your axe
if you have to. Gun`s no good.

703
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,953
What do you mean the gun`s no good?
Now, look--

704
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,858
Eddie.

705
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,866
Hold it, captain.

706
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,422
-There`s something in here, all right.
-You`re a little off base.

707
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:32,789
That`s the mineralogy lab.
Radioactive isotopes are in there.

708
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,693
Your Geiger`s reacting to a roomful
of uranium ore samples.

709
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,697
Yeah.

710
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,909
-This door`s locked.
-Dr. Stern has the key.

711
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,016
-Oh, yes.
-What`s in here?

712
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,654
The greenhouse. The Eskimos have
a weakness for our strawberries.

713
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:02,484
-Strawberries at the North Pole.
-Excuse me.

714
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,395
Mac. Bob.

715
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,925
Look under these tables.

716
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,769
Bob, check that outside door.

717
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,111
-Door`s locked, sir.
-Nothing up here.

718
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,716
We`re still batting zero.

719
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,352
-Well, doctor?
-Captain, l--

720
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,458
-Nothing up that other corridor.
-Any suggestions, doctor?

721
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,424
-He`s obviously not inside.
-We`ll start looking outside--

722
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,529
-Close the door, please.
-Never mind.

723
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:46,191
Captain, half an hour outside now is all
we can stand. We`d better do it in relay.

724
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,931
-You`re right, Dr. Chapman. We`ll work out--
-Would you close the door, please?

725
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,301
We have to tell General Fogarty
what happened.

726
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,101
We`re liable to become famous.

727
00:51:55,345 --> 00:52:01,181
So few people can boast they`ve lost a flying
saucer and a man from Mars all in one day.

728
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:05,480
Wonder what they`d have done to Columbus
if he`d discovered America, then mislaid it.

729
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,452
Bunch of butterfingers.

730
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,489
Gentlemen, I just happened to notice....

731
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,254
Look at these moles.

732
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,697
They`re wilted.
The only thing that could--

733
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,668
A blast of icy air
if that rear door was opened.

734
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,034
-Have a look at that lock, professor.
-Yes.

735
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:31,009
-10 or 15 seconds of exposure would do it.
-Exactly.

736
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,808
What would that lead you to?

737
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,675
That it may have been....

738
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,516
-In here.
-Without a doubt.

739
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:44,558
Dr. Carrington, you were right.
The lock`s been forced back into position.

740
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:49,323
The key`s gone. Someone has entered
and gone and locked the door from....

741
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,468
-From the outside.
-Look. See how it glistens in the light?

742
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,899
It`s a smear of....

743
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:59,199
-Plant sap. From the wounded arm?
-You don`t suppose--?

744
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,535
Open it, please.

745
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:15,952
-One of the sled dogs.
-Not even cold yet.

746
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,161
-Doctor, doesn`t it seem kind of...?
-Shrunken. ls there any blood in there?

747
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,094
-None.
-No blood.

748
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,360
-No blood?
-Its blood has been drained.

749
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,038
Everything falls right into line.

750
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:34,505
What could be more natural for such a being
than seeking out the only open earth nearby?

751
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,148
It came here for refuge, heard us and ran.

752
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:42,409
-It`s been here. lt will come back again.
-We better tell--

753
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:46,055
I don`t agree. It`s far better
if science rather than the Army--

754
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:50,955
-Are you sure this is the best thing to do?
-I`m sure we can communicate with it.

755
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:56,098
It`s wiser than we are. It`s our only chance
to talk to it, to learn so many things.

756
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:59,427
-Dr. Carrington is right.
-Surely you understand that, Stern.

757
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,605
Will you two stand guard
here with me tonight?

758
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,272
-Surely, doctor.
-All right.

759
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,739
Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Olson
what we`ve found.

760
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:11,573
Ask them to come back
and relieve us in the morning.

761
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:15,783
And tell them, please,
to confide in no one.

762
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,929
-Any luck, captain?
-Lee, you better get some more coffee ready.

763
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,106
-Find anything, captain?
-Not a sign.

764
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,901
-Barnes flushed a polar bear.
-Sure did.

765
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:44,305
-Scare you?
-Not after I saw it was only a bear.

766
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,005
-Too cold out there for that.
-You didn`t find anything.

767
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,186
I didn`t think you would.
When we lose them, they stay lost.

768
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:54,483
Not that it makes much difference.
Nothing`s coming in on the radio.

769
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:58,457
-Tex, you got something?
-General Fogarty`s running a temperature.

770
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,460
This came in clear 1 0 minutes ago,
then it got fouled up again.

771
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:06,398
``Fogarty to Hendry: take all precautions to
preserve aircraft carefully until my arrival.``

772
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:10,596
Same to same. ``Use same precautions
with corpses of any occupants.``

773
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,435
Same to same.
``Forward detailed description of aircraft.

774
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,875
Measurements, approximate weight
and so forth. lmportant.``

775
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,642
``Fogarty to Hendry: why haven`t
you answered? Want immediate answer.``

776
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:26,185
Same to same. ``Radio silence unnecessary.
Reference message Fogarty to Hendry.

777
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,254
Acknowledge immediately.

778
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,358
Waiting report. Silence confusing.``

779
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,357
Same to same. ``Acknowledge.``

780
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,427
-Same to same--
-Acknowledge at once.

781
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:39,091
-I gather he wants to hear from me.
-There`s nothing for me? I don`t believe it.

782
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,497
How can a man get to be
a general without--?

783
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,909
In the greenhouse....

784
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,371
See--

785
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,379
-Barnes, watch that corridor.
-Bring the first aid kit.

786
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:56,541
-Captain, this is my job.
-Bob, better start warning the rest of camp.

787
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:01,019
-Does that speaker system work from here?
-Yes. The left switch runs to all rooms.

788
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,886
Attention, everybody in camp.
Bolt your doors.

789
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:08,258
Our visitor has returned and is dangerous.
Stay where you are until notified.

790
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,762
Stay where you are.

791
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,938
-Easy. lt`ll be all right.
-What happened, doctor?

792
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,805
In the greenhouse,
I was working. I couldn`t see.

793
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:26,379
Then a blast of cold air,
and I heard Olson scream.

794
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,984
-When I turned, the thing struck at me.
-Go on.

795
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:33,849
I don`t remember. My head--
I must have fallen.

796
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,483
When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach.
They were--

797
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:41,824
Give him some more of that. Get those axes.
Go ahead, doctor.

798
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:47,536
They were both hanging from the beams
upside down, dead. Their throats were cut.

799
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,364
-I crawled--
-Was it there when you left?

800
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,267
l couldn`t see.

801
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:55,809
-Here you are, sir.
-Wait, Pat! I want to get a picture.

802
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,622
Wait a minute. He could get out
of the greenhouse through the outside door.

803
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:11,487
-We can get to it through the generator room.
-You two go with him.

804
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,993
-You mean go in?
-Seal the door with anything you can find.

805
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,098
That`s better.

806
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,703
-Easy. Give them time to get in there.
-Pat, I want a picture.

807
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:25,033
-You get back with the rest.
-Don`t be silly.

808
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,539
-It`ll cost you a drink.
-I`ll buy him a beer.

809
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,676
-Ready, Bob?
-No, but go ahead and open it.

810
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:53,561
Get something to prop this door, something
short enough to get under this bolt!

811
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:58,373
-Get your picture, Scotty?
-No. The door wasn`t open long enough.

812
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,770
-Want me to open it again?
-No!

813
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,276
-Bring a hammer and some spikes!
-Hit that in, will you?

814
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,616
There. That ought to do it.

815
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,652
Doctor Chapman, you`re sure
there`s no other way out? No windows?

816
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:14,881
-Only the front and back doors.
-The walls solid?

817
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,582
-Corrugated iron.
-You don`t think that--?

818
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:26,063
You found a dog in there, bled white
by our visitor. Why didn`t you report it?

819
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,636
-It wasn`t necessary.
-It was necessary to leave friends to die?

820
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,397
I posted them as guards--

821
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:36,442
I looked in. They`re hanging upside down
like in a slaughterhouse. Wish you`d seen it.

822
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,511
-Can`t we do something?
-They`re dead.

823
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:43,380
Let`s see nobody joins them. Doctor, you`re
limited to your room, lab and the mess hall.

824
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:47,078
You have no authority of any kind.
No right to assume--

825
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,417
You better move along.

826
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:57,364
We`ve got the rear door blocked.
If he gets out...

827
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:00,695
...he`ll have to dig through
oil drums and a couple tons of snow.

828
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:05,864
-Bob, next time raise the sights a little.
-I was too busy to think about that.

829
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,010
We`re gonna have to set up
a guard here in the corridor.

830
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:13,842
-Two-hour shifts. We`ll need volunteers.
-Count me in, captain.

831
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,586
You sent for us, doctor?

832
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:31,956
You said you had news for us, doctor.

833
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:35,899
Yes, yes. l....

834
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,007
Gentlemen, we find ourselves in a battle.

835
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:45,078
I`m not referring to the minor argument
with Capt. Hendry...

836
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:48,444
...but this creature from a new world.

837
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:52,254
Two of our colleagues have died,
a third is injured.

838
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,015
Those are our losses,
and there may be more.

839
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:58,250
This creature is more powerful
and intelligent than we are.

840
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:01,589
He regards us as important
only for his nourishment.

841
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:07,930
He has the same attitude toward us
as we have toward a field of cabbages.

842
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,898
That is our battle.

843
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:16,601
Only science can conquer him.
All other weapons will be powerless, only--

844
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,710
There must....

845
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:24,910
There must be a way. l`ve been trying to--

846
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,457
Sorry. I`m very tired. I haven`t slept.

847
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,628
It`s difficult--

848
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,562
Difficult to talk.

849
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:40,167
-Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?
-Doctor, you need some rest.

850
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,668
Yes, I know, but--

851
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:46,175
Please read my notes.

852
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:50,175
``At 9:00 p.m., I placed the seeds taken from
the severed hand of X...

853
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,041
...in four inches of earth.

854
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,876
I saturated the earth....

855
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,488
I saturated the earth with two units
of plasma taken from our blood bank.

856
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,989
The condition of the dog found
in the greenhouse indicated blood...

857
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:07,162
...was a primal factor
in the cultivation of the seeds.

858
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:09,729
At 2:00 a.m....

859
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:14,335
At 2:00 a.m., the first sprouts
appeared through the soil.``

860
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:19,132
-Five hours.
-Yes. I used another two units of plasma.

861
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:24,472
At 4:00 a.m., the sprouts began
to take on definite form.

862
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,149
I came to the conclu--

863
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,814
l see by your faces you don`t believe me.

864
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:37,516
Well, you may judge for yourselves.

865
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,569
Oh, no. lt isn`t possible.

866
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:01,011
-It reproduces itself.
-Amazing speed.

867
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,516
This would bear out
Capt. Hendry`s impression.

868
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:08,384
When he saw the creature in the
greenhouse, it had grown a new arm.

869
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:12,425
-This pulsating, doctor?
-As though they were breathing.

870
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:16,758
-Yes. Human plants.
-Superhuman.

871
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:20,060
-All this because of the blood plasma?
-That`s correct.

872
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,870
Notice these, closer to the source of
the plasma. While these, farther away.

873
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:28,509
-How many units have we?
-Enough, I hope.

874
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,806
Would you care to listen to them,
Professor Wilson?

875
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,539
Yes, thank you. I should.

876
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,527
Well?

877
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:59,841
Almost like the wail
of a newborn child that`s hungry.

878
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,510
-That`s the way I would have described it.
-Doctor?

879
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,509
-Yes, Miss Nicholson?
-Would you mind very much if l--?

880
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:10,118
-Will you be needing me anymore?
-No. Just finish typing my notes.

881
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,153
Return them to me.
Let no one see them.

882
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:17,624
Doctor, I think you should
get some sleep.

883
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:19,522
There`s too much to do.

884
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:23,392
-Your mind can`t work if you`re exhausted.
-My mind`s still clear.

885
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,093
No, it isn`t, doctor. You aren`t thinking
of what`s happening in the greenhouse.

886
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,740
He`s growing those seeds in there
using blood. Just as you are.

887
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:36,002
You`ve seen what one creature like that
can do. Just imagine a thousand.

888
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,645
-I have imagined it.
-Arthur...

889
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:42,313
...what if that aircraft came
not just to visit the Earth...

890
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:47,820
...but to conquer it? To start growing
some kind of horrible army?

891
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:52,324
-To turn the human race into food for it?
-Many things threaten our world...

892
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:55,759
-...new stars, comets shooting--
-But those are theories.

893
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,866
-This is an enemy here.
-There are no enemies in science...

894
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:03,562
...only phenomena to study.
We are studying one.

895
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,384
Come in.

896
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:25,821
-Hello, Pat.
-Hi. Nikki, I want to ask you something.

897
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:30,021
Has anybody up here been hurt lately?
Anybody shot, stabbed or operated on?

898
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:33,464
No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse
has been our first diversion.

899
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:38,299
I brought up 35 units of blood plasma
two months ago. What`s become of it?

900
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:42,033
-Why do you want to know?
-Why are they not giving it to Dr. Stern?

901
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:46,510
They`re giving him blood transfusions
instead of plasma. Two live donors.

902
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,844
What`s Carrington doing with
35 units of blood plasma?

903
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,747
I guess....

904
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:56,550
I guess you`d better take a swing at
my chin and have a look at those notes.

905
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,490
I should be trying to stop you.

906
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,930
So that`s what he`s been doing.

907
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:11,898
Thanks. Thanks for not stopping me.

908
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,311
Pat, would you remember something?
He`s tired.

909
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:21,710
He hasn`t slept since you found
that thing. And he`s not thinking right.

910
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,785
I know him. And he doesn`t think
the way we do anyway.

911
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:29,515
But he`s found something no one can
understand. Until he can solve it, he`ll--

912
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:33,661
-You know, like a kid with a new toy--
-Only this toy`s liable to bite him.

913
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,160
Thanks again.

914
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:45,106
Where`s Dr. Carrington?

915
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:48,242
I`m sorry. I have no authorization
to give you any--

916
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,242
-I`m very busy.
-I know you`re busy, doctor.

917
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,881
I understand you`ve been gardening.
Where are they?

918
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,607
-Why?
-This way to the nursery, Pat.

919
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:02,086
I don`t tolerate intrusions
into my laboratory. Don`t touch.

920
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,226
This is what your colleagues
are doing in the greenhouse.

921
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:08,329
-This is an improvement.
-What happened was not my fault.

922
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:11,295
We`ve read your notes.
You should have consulted us.

923
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,230
I have the help I need.
Your opinion has not been asked.

924
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:18,703
lt has by Capt. Hendry. And l`ve given
it to him. I`ll repeat it for you.

925
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,603
We`re facing something
unpredictably dangerous.

926
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:25,143
The creature in the greenhouse
is obviously multiplying itself.

927
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:27,407
We have no way of finding out
how much.

928
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:30,346
It will need more blood
and will try to obtain what it needs.

929
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:34,080
-It`s imprisoned and harmless.
-How can you be sure of our safety?

930
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,882
Or the safety of the world?

931
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:40,654
Think of 1000 such creatures. 10,000. lt
must be destroyed, this progeny with it.

932
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,558
-No.
-We can burn these.

933
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,495
-What about that thing in the greenhouse?
-You`re like frightened boys.

934
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,797
-You`re right. I am frightened.
-Any destruction would be an outrage...

935
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,973
-...a betrayal of science.
-It may be.

936
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,405
-But I`ll sleep better if we get rid of it.
-Captain, Barnes finally...

937
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,238
...got a message through.
Here`s the answer.

938
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,040
-Go ahead.
-``Fogarty to Hendry:

939
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:04,743
Carrington informs me Martian alive.
Keep it alive and protect it against injury.

940
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:08,583
Under no circumstances take action
against it until my arrival.``

941
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:13,455
You have your orders, Capt. Hendry.
l consider them sane and intelligent.

942
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:16,631
-But, Tex, what about me?
-Not a thing, Scotty.

943
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,268
-What do we do, Pat?
-Try changing the Army`s mind.

944
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,780
Hey! Hey, it`s me, Eddie!

945
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,653
-What are you doing here?
-We can`t take it out there.

946
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,292
Drop the idea of guarding
from the outside.

947
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,621
The wind`s blowing so hard
you can`t see.

948
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,923
It can go through walls
as easy as doors.

949
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:53,431
-How could it get through iron walls?
-Use a can opener.

950
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:58,005
-We`re dropping the outside guard.
-Put that hand in some ice water.

951
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,869
-Who`s out in the corridor?
-Stone and Wilson, sir.

952
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,876
Barnes, tell them they`re the only ones
on guard. Tell them to watch it.

953
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,847
-Tex?
-Here I am.

954
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,783
You won`t be long.
We`re dropping the outside guard.

955
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,219
Come join the rest of them
in the mess hall.

956
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:20,452
I`ll be all right. I`ve got the door braced,
and there`s no outside windows.

957
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,131
All right. lf you want to be brave.

958
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:27,233
-Well.
-Pat, what are we gonna do?

959
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,873
Anybody around here
want some coffee?

960
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:33,632
No, but you can come in.

961
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:37,334
That`s the reason I brought it.
I was hoping you might ask me in.

962
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:41,247
-Who wants some?
-I could use a half.

963
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:45,213
-What were you saying, Scotty?
-I was wondering-- That`s enough. Thanks.

964
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:51,087
What happens if our boyfriend gets lonely
and strolls around and ends up in here?

965
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,557
-I`ve been figuring that.
-Nothing hurts it.

966
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,925
-What do you do with a vegetable?
-Boil it.

967
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:02,264
-What`d you say?
-Boil it. Stew it. Bake it. Fry it.

968
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,666
-That makes sense.
-Cold doesn`t bother it.

969
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:07,933
Maybe Dr. Carrington will ask it
to crawl into a boiler.

970
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:11,874
-Maybe you could borrow a flamethrower.
-Captain, I got a crazy idea.

971
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:14,515
We got lots of kerosene
and we could--

972
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:24,090
-Point three. Point four.
-Here`s where we start cooking.

973
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:27,319
Point five. Point six.

974
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,597
That thing`s out of the greenhouse.
Stay together.

975
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,792
Point nine. What about throwing
kerosene on it and setting it on fire?

976
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,631
-We can try.
-Here`s a full can.

977
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:39,340
I`ll take it. We`ll need
something to put it in.

978
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,475
-Here`s a pail.
-Here`s another.

979
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,542
-One point two.
-We need one more.

980
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,907
-Pat, this one will work all right.
-Good.

981
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:47,946
Watch that cigarette, lieutenant.

982
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,380
How we gonna set it on fire,
rub sticks together?

983
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,645
-There`s a Veri pistol in my bag.
-I`ll get it.

984
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,518
If it comes in, you wet it down.
Mac, touch it off. And don`t miss.

985
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,125
-You be ready if it needs more.
-You`re right.

986
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,125
-Shut up.
-One point three now.

987
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,731
-You know how to shoot that?
-I saw Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.

988
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:08,631
-One point four.
-Come here. Get in the corner.

989
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,305
Hold this in front of you.
Stay by the light switch.

990
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,908
One point five. One point six.

991
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,069
-What was that?
-It sounded like a window.

992
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,507
-One point eight.
-Turn off those lights.

993
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:24,049
One point nine.
The needle`s hit the top.

994
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,849
-Put the fire out!
-I am!

995
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,020
Watch it, captain!

996
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,895
-Block that window!
-Hey, Scotty!

997
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,644
-This will make your hand feel better.
-Thank you.

998
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,074
-This ought to be enough kerosene.
-Get it ready.

999
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,049
-How`s it coming, Barnes?
-It`ll be okay.

1000
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:36,384
What makes me mad is he didn`t do it.
I busted it falling over the bunk.

1001
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,753
Listen, we want you all to stay here.

1002
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,953
We found a way to fight this thing,
but burned out a room.

1003
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:46,260
-It`s not hurt much, from the way it took off.
-About as much effect as a hot foot.

1004
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:47,765
It`s sure to come back.

1005
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,633
We don`t want to burn the whole place.
So we`re going after it.

1006
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,365
It probably went to the greenhouse.
We`ll start there.

1007
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:58,205
Meantime, stay here.
Watch the door into the hallway.

1008
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,781
-Keep your eye on the Geiger counter.
-Here are the fire extinguishers.

1009
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,748
-Who`s your electrical expert?
-That`s my line.

1010
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:08,616
-Can you hook into the intercom system?
-We can take one from any room.

1011
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,224
-I can help.
-Mac, we`ll be in the radio room.

1012
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,725
Let us know when you`re ready.
You all right?

1013
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:16,693
-Yeah. l`d like to tag along.
-Haven`t you had enough?

1014
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:19,390
lf I start burning up again,
who`ll put out the fire?

1015
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,069
We`re very proud of our captain.

1016
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:29,110
Now, look, put one of the intercoms
here. That`ll take care of this end.

1017
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:33,338
Put another down here at the junction.
See if they work through the mess hall.

1018
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,813
You said you were gonna
use kerosene again.

1019
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:40,114
-Know anything better?
-Something hotter. Why not use electricity?

1020
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:44,315
-You mean your lighting system?
-No, we can hook in a new transformer.

1021
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,256
-lt will give us plenty of amps.
-Enough to burn him?

1022
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:50,626
-More than enough.
-Could you use leads to two poles?

1023
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,165
-If you insulate the poles.
-Sounds good.

1024
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,827
Bob, give him a hand.
Come on, Tex. You go to work.

1025
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,802
Get Anchorage if you can.
Tell them the whole story.

1026
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:03,869
Tell them we`re in bad shape
and to bring hand grenades, mortars...

1027
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,546
...flamethrowers, anything.

1028
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:08,979
Tell them if I don`t send a story,
I`m gonna shoot myself.

1029
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:12,085
-Better comb your hair first.
-What hair?

1030
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,017
-Hey, say that again.
-Oh, Nikki, not you too.

1031
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,555
-He`s sensitive.
-You too.

1032
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,784
-I got hair.
-Doesn`t make you prettier.

1033
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,825
-No, your breath.
-I`m sorry.

1034
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,623
-He`s sensitive about that too.
-I`ve been upset.

1035
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:28,895
-You ninnies. Look. That`s what I mean.
-Hey, look. You too.

1036
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,665
-It`s getting cold.
-The heat must be off.

1037
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,272
It is off.

1038
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,402
It`s not getting oil.
See if it`s the same across the hall.

1039
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:41,707
-Tex, where do these heaters get oil?
-Around behind. Outside.

1040
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,750
-Pat, heat`s off in the mess hall!
-No.

1041
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,422
-No more oil coming in.
-It`s off in there too.

1042
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,422
-Could the tank be empty?
-Filled day before yesterday.

1043
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,221
The main line could be plugged.
Better fix it.

1044
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,990
Probably run into our visitor,
who`d be waiting for you.

1045
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,791
We underestimate this guy.

1046
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,469
-Trying to freeze us out, huh?
-That isn`t gonna be hard.

1047
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:04,230
-It`s down to 40 degrees.
-It`s 60 below outside.

1048
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,805
-How long will these rooms hold heat?
-Half an hour.

1049
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:09,477
-By then, we`ll be stiff.
-If no one goes out...

1050
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,508
...won`t it think of something else?

1051
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:16,878
It`ll think that our only chance to keep
warm is electricity. Heaters, blankets.

1052
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,248
It could break the circuit,
cut a line, except at the source.

1053
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,219
-The generator room.
-Get them all in there.

1054
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:26,053
-I`ll tell Tex.
-Bring food, medicine, blankets, clothes.

1055
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:30,823
-Bring our flying clothes.
-Most got burned. I`ll see what I can salvage.

1056
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,501
-Get the transformer hooked up to that.
-It`s cold in here.

1057
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,397
-The thing`s turned the heat off.
-What?

1058
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,162
-What`ll we do?
-I don`t know.

1059
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:41,069
The next thing`s electricity,
so everybody`s in the generator room.

1060
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,437
Did you do a good job
on the outside door?

1061
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,546
-Houdini`d find it tough getting in.
-He`ll come through here.

1062
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:50,013
It`s the only way. Got any fence wire
strong enough for the voltage?

1063
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,187
-Whole rolls of it.
-That`ll work.

1064
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:53,877
-What?
-Lay it on the ground.

1065
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:57,354
A lead overhead and on each side.
When it gets to the spot, juice him.

1066
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:58,992
-I don`t get you.
-Where`s the wire?

1067
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,286
-Down here.
-Give me those.

1068
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,829
-What are you doing?
-We`ll rig an electric flytrap for him.

1069
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,033
What do you mean?

1070
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,532
-Scotty, get me a hammer and nails.
-Sure.

1071
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,430
Better get out of the way.

1072
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:14,734
-Looks as if the situation`s well in hand.
-I`ve given all the orders I`m gonna give.

1073
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:18,344
If I thought that were true,
I`d ask you to marry me. Here`s your coat.

1074
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,911
l wanna keep my mind open.

1075
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,640
-Hammer and nails.
-Down there.

1076
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:25,479
-Where do you want us?
-ln the generator room. Move along.

1077
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,350
-Sorry, changed my mind. It`s all off.
-Keep moving, everybody.

1078
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:32,789
-I want another word with you.
-No time now. Move along.

1079
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:36,294
Make way. Clear this out.
Clear this place.

1080
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:37,988
-Where are those cutters?
-Here.

1081
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,566
-Where`s your Geiger counter?
-I got one too.

1082
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,999
Go to the assembly room.
If you get anything, come running.

1083
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,798
-Get me a pair of gloves.
-Use mine.

1084
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:06,327
-Leave enough to hook the overhead wire.
-Got plenty.

1085
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:14,324
-Here we are, lieutenant.
-Yeah, that ought to give us a ground.

1086
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,832
-There she is, captain.
-Down to five degrees now.

1087
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,803
-Perfect for skiing.
-Better get rubber boots, Scotty.

1088
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:23,443
-Why?
-Insulation when they turn the juice on.

1089
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,545
-Oh, yeah.
-There`s a pair back here.

1090
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,874
-Where?
-Wait. You won`t need any boots.

1091
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,813
When it comes, go back.
You don`t belong out here.

1092
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:35,046
I didn`t belong at Alamein or Okinawa.
I was just kibitzing.

1093
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:39,023
I also write a very good obituary.
Just ignore me, please.

1094
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,218
-Capt. Hendry.
-Go ahead.

1095
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,796
Just hooked this up.
Checking if it works.

1096
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,660
Fine. Watch your Geiger counter.

1097
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:48,893
-Mac, did you hear?
-Every word. I hope that`s all I hear.

1098
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:52,540
-So do l.
-Here`s another message from Washington.

1099
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:58,236
``Use every means to protect lives,
but take no steps against your prisoner.``

1100
01:16:58,513 --> 01:16:59,775
Our prisoner.

1101
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:03,816
-You can`t ignore orders.
-Testify to that at my court-martial.

1102
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:07,921
You`re robbing science of the greatest secret
that`s ever come to it.

1103
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,956
-Go back.
-Knowledge is more important than life.

1104
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:14,595
We`ve only one excuse for existing.
To think. To find out. To learn.

1105
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:17,492
What can we learn from that,
except a way to die?

1106
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:21,226
lt doesn`t matter what happens.
Nothing counts except our thinking.

1107
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,996
We fought into nature.
We`ve split the atom--

1108
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,400
That sure made the world happy.
Didn`t it?

1109
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,873
We owe it to the brain of our species
to stand here and die...

1110
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:33,104
-...without destroying a source of wisdom.
-Capt. Hendry.

1111
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,875
-Civilization has given us orders.
-Get him out of here.

1112
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,416
Oh, you fools. You`ll never hurt it.

1113
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,885
-Go ahead.
-I`m getting a Geiger counter reaction.

1114
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,524
-What`s your reading?
-Point two, but steady.

1115
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:47,695
Watch it. Tell us any change.
Mac, anything your way?

1116
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,363
-Not a glimmer.
-Watch it.

1117
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:51,259
Here`s the operating switch.

1118
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:55,334
-How can it get cold so quick?
-Keep moving around.

1119
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:59,238
-It must be zero.
-It was. Next stop, five below.

1120
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:03,468
Come on, Mr. Martian, and get some
nice Scotch blood. One hundred proof.

1121
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,080
-Nothing like it for babies.
-Tell him to cut it out.

1122
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:11,911
No, no. Let him go on. I like
goose pimples. They keep me warm.

1123
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,355
Did you get a picture of that thing
on fire?

1124
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:18,754
No. I shot one while I was
falling backward over the bed.

1125
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,121
Probably got the ceiling
and my big feet.

1126
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:24,230
Capt. Hendry, going up a little.
Point four now.

1127
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:28,130
-Hang on. Mac, any change?
-Just the same. Only colder.

1128
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:32,397
-Means he`s coming by the mess hall.
-Excuse me. I got an idea.

1129
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:33,938
-What?
-Here we go again.

1130
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:38,044
Your boy`s pretty smart. He might see
these wires and think it over.

1131
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,613
-Yeah.
-lf he thinks too long, we`re cold meat.

1132
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:45,617
-What if we met him by the junction?
-Let him see us there and chase us?

1133
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:47,482
The less light, the better.

1134
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:51,181
Turn off this light and this one here.
Don`t tell me I`m right.

1135
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,021
Capt. Hendry, going up.
Point eight now.

1136
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,527
-I`m getting some too.
-It`s showing here.

1137
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,099
-Both of you, back here. Come running.
-Halfway there.

1138
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:03,032
If you speed up that generator,
can you get more out?

1139
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:06,832
-Certainly do no harm to try.
-Bill and Tex, go with him. Nikki too.

1140
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,100
-No.
-Good luck to you.

1141
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,640
What`s the matter?

1142
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:15,749
-I was wishing we`d tested this thing.
-What if we haven`t enough voltage?

1143
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:17,816
-Keep swinging at its arms.
-One point two.

1144
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,782
-It`s on its way.
-I got a worry.

1145
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,548
Report from the front,
McPherson has a worry.

1146
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,157
-This is no joke.
-What?

1147
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:27,817
-What if he can read our minds?
-He`ll be mad when he gets to me.

1148
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,759
-One point four.
-Keep moving around, you guys.

1149
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,524
Keep it quiet.

1150
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:38,001
I remember the first execution I ever
covered. Ruth Snyder and Judd Grey.

1151
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,970
-Did you get a picture?
-No. They didn`t allow cameras.

1152
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:44,178
-One point six and going up.
-Don`t move till he sees us.

1153
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:47,644
Give him a chance to look.
Leave me room to reach that switch.

1154
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,818
Stay away from the walls
when he hits the juice.

1155
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:52,919
-Everybody got rubber boots on?
-Yes, sir.

1156
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,850
One point eight.

1157
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,956
I heard something.

1158
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,424
It`s getting near the top.

1159
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,430
Get your posts!

1160
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:19,813
All right. Ease back.

1161
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,358
-What the--?
-The juice is off!

1162
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,192
Carrington`s turned off the generator.

1163
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,733
Bob, bring a flashlight. Eddie,
hold him off as long as you can.

1164
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:46,597
-Watch out. He`s got a gun.
-Keep away. Keep away.

1165
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,106
Keep away. I won`t
allow you to destroy--

1166
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:52,371
Turn on that generator!
Get back here, Eddie.

1167
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,755
Eddie, get back!
Stay away from that wire!

1168
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,990
I`m your friend. I have no weapons.
I`m your friend.

1169
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,761
You`re wiser than l. You must understand
what I`m trying to tell you.

1170
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:19,270
Don`t go farther. They`ll kill you.
They think you`ll harm us.

1171
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:22,101
But I want to know you,
to help you. Believe that.

1172
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,244
You`re wiser than anything on earth.

1173
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:27,677
Use that intelligence. Look
and know what I`m telling you.

1174
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,979
I`m not your enemy.
I`m a scientist who`s trying--

1175
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:34,053
Hold it.

1176
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:39,287
Wait until he gets right
in the middle of it, sir.

1177
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:45,391
He`s gotta be on that walk, captain.

1178
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:55,833
Wait till he gets right
in the middle, sir.

1179
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:33,306
-Oh, that`s it. Stop. Turn it off.
-Let it go. We don`t want any part left.

1180
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:01,135
Well, you can get a picture now, Scotty.

1181
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:31,367
-This will take a minute to warm up.
-Okay.

1182
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:34,973
Is there any reason now
why I can`t send my story?

1183
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,872
-Only take five minutes.
-I guess it`s okay.

1184
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:40,344
You`re looking better to me
than you used to.

1185
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,345
-All done, Pat.
-Get everything?

1186
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,485
Burned everything in Carrington`s lab
and the greenhouse.

1187
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,417
-Burned the arm too.
-How is Dr. Carrington?

1188
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,591
He`s got a broken collarbone
and a headache.

1189
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,657
I`m not getting enough voltage.

1190
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,954
-I`ll check the generator for you.
-Good.

1191
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:58,189
-Anybody want some coffee?
-No, but you can come in.

1192
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,699
-You better have some. You look tired.
-He should look tired.

1193
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,736
-He`s had two things on his mind.
-We`ve only had one.

1194
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:08,170
-Our worries are over, while our captain--
-Shut up.

1195
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,537
lsn`t there something you
can do about it, Nikki?

1196
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:14,442
l don`t know. You know, I`m getting
pretty fed up with the North Pole.

1197
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,879
-How much does a captain make?
-Not much.

1198
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:18,643
That`s a good start. Go ahead.

1199
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:20,787
-Enough to support two?
-Not nearly.

1200
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:23,583
-Captain, you get flight pay.
-Some for each dependent.

1201
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:26,317
-We can handle that.
-I won`t be railroaded into anything.

1202
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,961
I`ve got an idea.

1203
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:31,360
-This is gonna work.
-You ought to settle down.

1204
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,830
-There you are.
-lt`d be much better for us.

1205
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:36,902
Sure. Our captain always
getting into trouble.

1206
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:40,130
-Remember that night in Honolulu?
-That was pretty bad.

1207
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,843
-I don`t know what they`re talking about.
-He should light somewhere.

1208
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:48,038
-See, they know what`s best for you.
-Here we are. Plenty of voltage now.

1209
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:54,411
Anchorage, from Polar Expedition 6.
Can you hear me? Over.

1210
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:59,821
-Anchorage, reception clear. Stand by.
-Press the button and speak, Scotty.

1211
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:03,964
Tell General Fogarty we`ve sent for
Capt. Hendry. He`ll be here in minutes.

1212
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:08,101
-Roger. Over.
-Are there any newsmen there? Over.

1213
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,602
-The place is full of them. Over.
-All right. Here`s your story.

1214
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,468
North Pole, November 3rd.
Ned Scott reporting.

1215
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:18,577
One of the world`s greatest battles
was fought and won by the human race.

1216
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,476
A handful of American soldiers
and civilians...

1217
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:24,117
...met the first invasion
from another planet.

1218
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,880
A man by the name of Noah once saved
our world with an ark of wood.

1219
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:32,116
Here, a few men performed
a similar service with an arc of electricity.

1220
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:35,888
A flying saucer, which landed here,
and its pilot have been destroyed.

1221
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:39,328
But not without casualties among
our own meager forces.

1222
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:43,265
I`d like to bring to the microphone
the men responsible for our success.

1223
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:49,808
But Capt. Hendry is attending
to demands over and above the call of duty.

1224
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,775
Dr. Carrington, leader
of the scientific expedition...

1225
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,745
-...is recovering from wounds from the battle.
-Good for you.

1226
01:25:55,950 --> 01:26:00,319
And now, before giving you the details
of the battle, I bring you a warning.

1227
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,990
Every one of you listening to my voice...

1228
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:07,389
...tell the world. Tell this to everybody
wherever they are:

1229
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:13,966
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.
