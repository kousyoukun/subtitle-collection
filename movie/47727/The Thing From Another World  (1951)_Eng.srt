1
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,578
- H¡, Eddie.
- Hiya, Scotty.

2
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,207
- Cold enough for you? - Well, I'm
only faintly alive. It's 25 below.

3
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,792
- You know everybody?
- We haven't met.

4
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,960
- McPherson.
- Hi.

5
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,671
Ned Scott, Capt. Hendry.
Scotty just got in today.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,006
Hi, care to join us?

7
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,800
Wait till I count my fingers.
I may have lost one.

8
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,430
Scotty's a warm-weather man. We met
at Accra. Quite a spot. 105 in the shade...

9
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,892
and the women hardly wore
anything at all. Very intelligent of them.

10
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,020
You just lie there in a hammock
while three of them fan you.

11
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,855
- Remember, Scotty?
- I remember.

12
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,609
- Oh, boy. When I die I hope I go to Accra.
- I was there.

13
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:31,777
I'm in.

14
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,696
- What are you doing here, Mr. Scott?
- Looking for a story.

15
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,323
Scotty's a newspaperman.

16
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,116
- How many?
- Three.

17
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,620
- Cards?
- I'll play these.

18
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,206
- Caught from ambush.
- Check.

19
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,794
- Well, I'll bet a buck.
- And I'll fold.

20
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,003
Call.

21
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,673
- Pair of queens.
- I thought so. Aces.

22
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,133
You ought to know better
than to try fooling

23
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,593
our captain. Only
dames can do that.

24
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,720
- Lt. Dykes, I promise...
- Slip of the tongue.

25
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,848
- What do you hear
from the general?

26
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,392
- Fogarty's nursing secrets
like a June bride.

27
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,645
I got an idea. A guy in Seattle
knows a whole radar defense story...

28
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,438
loves to talk.
General McLaren.

29
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,359
Tell General Fogarty you want to go to
Seattle, and Pat and I will fly you there.

30
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,819
I met General McLaren too.

31
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:17,447
It's warm in Seattle. They got girls
there without fur pants on.

32
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,825
- What about it, captain?
- That could be right.

33
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,953
You won't be able to shoo our captain
southward with his heart...

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,247
wrapped around the North Pole.
- That'll do.

35
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,417
- What's going on up there?
- Scientists are holding a convention.

36
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,336
- Looking for polar bear tails.
- Ever hear of Dr. Carrington?

37
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,338
- The fellow who was at Bikini?
- The same.

38
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,341
They're holding about 2000 miles
north of here. A whole bunch.

39
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,261
- Botanists, physicists, electronic...
- Including a pin-up girl.

40
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,138
- Very interesting type too.
- Very.

41
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,515
Capt. Hendry can give
you any data on her.

42
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,393
- You probably shouldn't have said that.
- Well, after I read...

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,811
Now look!

44
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,897
Someday I hope to have
a navigator and a

45
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,024
copilot who are at least
dry behind the ears.

46
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,067
- Oh, captain.
- You mail-order...

47
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,030
Capt. Hendry, report to General Fogarty's
quarters at once please.

48
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:02,367
8:00 at night and the general yelling
for his troops. Sounds like the old days.

49
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,161
- Take my hand. Will you?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,706
Captain, if it amounts to anything,
bring me in on it. Will you, please?

51
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,416
Sure.

52
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,377
I gotta get a story someplace.

53
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,089
Come in.

54
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,844
- Close the door.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,268
- Good evening, sir.
- Didn't take you long.

56
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,853
Not many places to hide, sir.

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,189
Just got a queer message
from your picnic

58
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,566
party up north, from
Dr. Carrington himself.

59
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,153
"Believe an airplane unusual type
crashed in our vicinity.

60
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,031
Please send facilities to investigate.
Most urgent."

61
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,034
What would you find up there
besides a good-looking girl?

62
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,161
- I don't know, sir. Any ships missing?
- No.

63
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,288
- No Canadians either.
- Could be Russians.

64
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,999
- They're all over the pole like flies.
- You're going.

65
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,753
Take along a dog team or anything
you might need for rescue.

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,088
Come in.

67
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,798
Close the door!

68
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,218
You suppose the Pentagon
could send us a revolving door?

69
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,971
Could be, sir. We got pith helmets
last week.

70
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,056
- Weather report, sir.
- Okay, that's all.

71
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,559
If any messages come in
from Dr. Carrington,

72
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,352
I want to be
notified personally.

73
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,187
- No matter what the time.
- Yes, sir.

74
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,606
Here's your weather.
There's a front moving in...

75
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,025
but you ought to have time
to get there and back.

76
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,695
- General, that newspaperman, Scott...
- What about him?

77
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,823
- He'd like to go with us. - It's all
right if you maroon him up there.

78
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,284
Don't get me wrong
about who gets marooned.

79
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,078
I'd like it if you didn't smash
into the landing ski this time.

80
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,872
That was an unavoidable accident.

81
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,165
Well, look, I'll expect you back
tomorrow night.

82
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,836
- Yes, sir. And I'll close the door.
- Just tell me what you find up there.

83
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,797
No one tells me anything around here.

84
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,855
Want some coffee?

85
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,107
- Hey, thanks.
- Here you are, sir.

86
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,785
Mr. Scott. Coffee.

87
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,956
- Are we there?
- No, sir. Hot coffee up front, sir.

88
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,295
- Lieutenant? Coffee, sir.
- Thank you, stewardess.

89
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,257
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

90
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,968
How far are we from camp?

91
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,638
Three hours. We've slowed down.
A little headwind.

92
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,766
A little headwind?
Close to 40 miles.

93
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,435
Our captain has some funny ideas
about the North Pole.

94
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,230
He thinks it's a garden spot.
Come and bring the kiddies.

95
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,273
Now look, don't you two guys start.

96
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,901
You know, Perry went to
the North Pole once.

97
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,111
He retired with a
sack full of medals.

98
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,321
Hey, Pat.

99
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,282
We go there every three weeks
just like it was lover's lane.

100
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,327
Mr. Scott, some people
seem to think... Wait a minute.

101
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:55,457
Hello, Air Force 191 from
Polar Expedition 6. Can you read me?

102
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,502
Air Force 191. Hear you fine, Tex.
Go ahead.

103
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,380
- What's your position?
- Three hours out.

104
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:05,300
Captain, switch over to your radio compass.
Check it against your magnetic heading.

105
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,594
What's on your mind, Tex?

106
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,181
We've got some disturbance up here.
It's whacking away at everything.

107
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,643
- What do you figure it's from?
- Don't know. We noticed it last night.

108
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,021
- Six to eight degrees difference.
- We're quite a bit off here, Tex.

109
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,399
You better home in on me.
I'll leave the key open.

110
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,902
- Or would you rather have me sing to you?
- Leave the key open.

111
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,530
I was afraid you'd say that.

112
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,550
Hey, the taxpayers ought to see this.

113
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,098
Hello, doctor, professor.

114
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,642
- Still the same game?
- Yes.

115
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,143
Hello, boys.

116
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,606
- Doctor, professor. Here's your mail.
- You're just in time for lunch.

117
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,608
- Ken, I bet you
forgot my hairpins.

118
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,610
- Don't tell me I'm
nearly at the North Pole.

119
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,321
- Looks more like my Kentucky home.
- Mr. Scott, Mrs. Chapman.

120
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,949
- A pleasure, Mrs. Chapman.
- Hi, nice to see you.

121
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,285
- Dr. Chapman, Mr. Scott.
- Dr. Chapman.

122
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,162
- Scotty's a newspaperman.
- You've come at an opportune time.

123
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,250
I happened to be in Anchorage when your
message came. I hope you have a good story.

124
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,627
- No more than you know already.
- Nothing more at all?

125
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,922
Just discussions as to what it might be.
We all have different ideas.

126
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,550
- There's been arguments about it.
- Where's Dr. Carrington?

127
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,010
- In the lab.
- See you later.

128
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,012
Does that mean you've seen the plane?

129
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,513
- Coffee, captain?
- No, thanks.

130
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,390
Our captain seems in a hurry, Lee.

131
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,475
- Where are you two going?
- We're with you.

132
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,354
- We want to tell her she treated you
badly. - If you don't want us to go...

133
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,482
- I'm gonna get even with you two someday.
- We got up in there.

134
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,826
Come in.

135
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,413
Hi, Pat. Welcome to our igloo.
How was your...?

136
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,751
Well...

137
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:30,047
- How was your trip?
- All right. About usual.

138
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,715
Well, that's fine.

139
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,969
- I think Dr. Carrington wants to see you.
- He can wait. I wanna talk to you.

140
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,180
- What about?
- That was a dirty trick you played.

141
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,433
- Don't lose your temper.
- Why did you do it? Just tell me why.

142
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,810
Well, your legs aren't very pretty.

143
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,022
You didn't have to write a note
and put it on my chest.

144
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,190
I'm sorry, Pat...

145
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,527
Six people read it before I woke up.
Now the whole Air Force knows.

146
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,904
- Not so loud. They'll hear.
- They already heard.

147
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,073
The only place it hasn't been
is on a billboard.

148
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,826
I didn't know you had
such a nasty temper.

149
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,496
Now, Pat, just be careful.
Now take it easy.

150
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,456
Now wait a minute.

151
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,167
We had a lot of fun
when you were up here.

152
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,295
Then when you asked me down
to Anchorage, you deliberately fed me...

153
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,673
Tell me, did you really drink
all those drinks?

154
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,259
- You didn't throw any away? Not one?
- No.

155
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,719
Holy cat. I thought I was good.

156
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,888
And another thing, why did you leave?

157
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,057
When I woke up in the morning
you were gone.

158
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,685
I told you I had to take
that cargo plane back here.

159
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,478
- You told me?
- Don't you remember?

160
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,230
No.

161
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,985
Right after dinner. You were telling
me all about a night in San Francisco...

162
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,820
Did I tell you that?

163
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,282
What else did I do?

164
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,869
Well, you had moments
of kind of making like an octopus.

165
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,081
- I never saw so many hands in all my life.
- All right. All right.

166
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,960
Look, my only excuse
is that I liked you...

167
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,837
right away.

168
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:56,049
- So I started wrong. Can't we begin again?
- How would you begin?

169
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,595
- Well, I can think of several...
- Never mind.

170
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,972
We don't have time for that now anyway.

171
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,808
I know Dr. Carrington's waiting
to see you.

172
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,734
- What about this business of starting
over? - We'll talk about that later.

173
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,405
- Hello, captain.
- Hi, professor.

174
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:34,505
- Dr. Carrington, Capt. Hendry is here.
- Yes, I know.

175
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,507
- How do you do, captain?
- Doctor.

176
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,051
Miss Nicholson, would you add
a note to the others?

177
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,302
Surely.

178
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,556
November 2, 11:30 a. m.

179
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:49,686
Deviation in sector 19 continues
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.

180
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,398
No lessening or wavering
of disturbing element.

181
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,108
That's all.

182
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,862
- Captain, can we start now?
- Mind telling me where we're going?

183
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,364
48 miles due east from here.

184
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,784
Your message said an airplane crashed.
Is that what we're looking for?

185
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,035
I don't know, captain.

186
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,120
- I think you better explain.
- I'm sorry.

187
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,082
Miss Nicholson, would you read
Capt. Hendry my first notes?

188
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,670
I was thinking only of the vagueness
of my information. I dislike being vague.

189
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,588
- "November 1 st..."
- Yesterday.

190
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:21,802
6:15 p. M. Sound detectors and
seismographs registered explosion due east.

191
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,973
"At 6:18, magnetometer revealed deviation
12 degrees, 20 minutes east."

192
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,393
- That deviation has been constant.
- We ran into it before we got here.

193
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,521
"Such deviation possible only
if a disturbing force equivalent..."

194
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:36,066
to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore...
- 20,000 tons?

195
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:39,152
"...had become part of the earth
at about a 50-mile radius."

196
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,905
You're getting a bit beyond me,
but it sounds like a meteor.

197
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,825
Yes, very much. Except for one thing.

198
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,619
- Will, show it to Capt. Hendry.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,873
We have some special telescopic cameras.

200
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,084
On the appearance of radioactivity,
a Geiger counter trips the release...

201
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,919
and the cameras function.

202
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,548
They were working last evening.
This is the result.

203
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,929
This first picture was taken
three minutes before the explosion...

204
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,181
or 6:12.

205
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,267
You can see the small dot
below there in the corner.

206
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:15,397
On the next picture, one minute later,
that dot is moving from west to east...

207
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,317
fast enough to form a streak.
- What shutter speed is it?

208
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,528
- 1000th of a second.
- Moving pretty fast. Wasn't it?

209
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,616
Here, at 6:14, it's moving upward.

210
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,913
6:15, it drops to the earth
and vanishes.

211
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,250
A meteor might move almost horizontal
to the earth but never upward.

212
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,294
- Then it isn't a meteor.
- That's obvious.

213
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,296
How'd you find the distance of impact?

214
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,381
- By computation...
- Dr. Carrington?

215
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,759
- Ready?
- It's quite simple, captain.

216
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:47,513
We have the time of arrival
of the sound waves and detectors.

217
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,141
And also the arrival time
of the impact waves on the seismograph.

218
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:55,812
By computing the difference, it becomes
obvious they were caused by the object.

219
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,316
- The distance from here is 48 miles.
- I'll take your word for it.

220
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:03,487
One thing, doctor. 20,000 tons of steel
is a lot of metal for an airplane.

221
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,740
It is for the sort of airplane
we know, captain.

222
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:11,036
- Yeah, we'd better be going.
- Redding will check every quarter-hour.

223
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,956
- Will you want me, doctor?
- It won't be necessary.

224
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,000
- You come with us, Bill.
- Yes, doctor.

225
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,392
We'll be there pretty soon now, Pat.

226
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,478
Bob, get Carrington up here.

227
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,605
Doctor!

228
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,113
We're almost 50 miles out, doctor.

229
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,116
With your compass deviation,
how are you navigating, captain?

230
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,577
That peak ahead is practically due east.

231
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,537
We got the wind before we left camp.

232
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,582
- Very good, captain.
- We should be there about now, Pat.

233
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:01,295
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

234
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,839
Picking up something
on the Geiger counter, sir.

235
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:08,218
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

236
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:09,761
Look there.

237
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,935
- Pat, the compass is in a spin.
- Geiger's up to the top.

238
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,857
Yeah, that's it, all right.

239
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,280
- You see someplace to set down?
- Looked smooth about a half a mile back.

240
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,866
We'll take a look. Bob!
Get them ready. It might be rough.

241
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,284
Right, sir.

242
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,078
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
We're gonna land.

243
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,581
Sit down and hold on back there.

244
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,004
All set for landing, sir.

245
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,596
Half flaps.

246
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,058
- Full rich.
- Full rich.

247
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,267
Half flaps.

248
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,402
There we are.

249
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,238
Holy cat! What a weird-looking thing.

250
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,032
Let me get a picture
before you track up the whole place.

251
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,826
This Geiger counter is going crazy.

252
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,329
Something's melted that surface crust.
It's frozen over again into clear ice.

253
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,833
The bottle shape apparently was caused
by the craft first making contact...

254
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,002
with the earth out
at the neck of the bottle...

255
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,672
sliding toward us and forming
that larger area as it came to rest.

256
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:13,510
With the engines generating enough heat
to melt that path through the crust...

257
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,096
then sink beneath the surface.
- What could melt that much ice?

258
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,140
Let's go down and see. Barnes.

259
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,312
Take the dogs over on that side.

260
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,073
Dr. Chapman, could an airplane
melt that much ice?

261
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,827
One of our own jets generates enough heat
to warm a 50-story office building.

262
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:54,593
- It's part of an airfoil. Probably a
stabilizer. - It's an airplane, all right.

263
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,387
- Can you tell what metal that is?
- I'll need some tools.

264
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,890
Barnes, bring some tools!

265
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:07,481
Hey, it's down pretty deep over here.
I can't see anything but a dark mass.

266
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,774
It's deeper over here.

267
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:13,237
Captain, may I suggest that we spread out
and try to determine the size and shape.

268
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:17,699
Right. Spread out, everybody! We're gonna
try to figure out the shape of this thing.

269
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,785
Here's the tools, sir.

270
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,301
Holy cat!

271
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,845
Hey...

272
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,722
It's almost...

273
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,059
Yeah. Almost a perfect...

274
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:47,312
It is. It's round.

275
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,608
- We finally got one.
- We found a flying saucer!

276
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,111
Can anybody see anything
through the ice?

277
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,530
- Only an outline.
- Nothing but a dark shape.

278
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,991
Seems perfectly smooth.
No doors or windows.

279
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,494
- I can't see any engine. - I doubt
we find anything we call an engine.

280
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:06,415
Dr. Carrington, this isn't
any metal I know.

281
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,417
Probably some new alloy.

282
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,837
- Get some filings for analysis.
- Right.

283
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:16,175
Captain, I don't think we have a chance
of chopping through the ice with axes.

284
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,344
I know. We think so too. We'll try
to melt it out with thermite bombs.

285
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,680
- Oh, excellent.
- Where do you figure it's from?

286
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,056
I don't know, Mr. Scott.

287
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,892
- Well, from this planet?
- I doubt it.

288
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,769
- Well, do you...?
- The answers will be much easier...

289
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,689
after we've examined the interior
of the aircraft...

290
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:34,776
and its occupants, if there are any.
- Occupants? Why, I never...

291
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,945
What a story!
Where's the radio? Hey, Barnes!

292
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,698
- Hold it. No private messages.
- What do you mean private?

293
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,868
- I'm sending it to the whole world.
- This is Air Force information.

294
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,995
We'll have to wait for authority
to let you file it.

295
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:49,499
You got your authority in the Constitution!
It's called freedom of the press.

296
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,627
- I'm sending a story!
- Not from our ship.

297
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:54,087
- Where do you want the bombs?
- One by the stabilizer...

298
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,632
another over in the far side
if we need it.

299
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,302
It's the biggest story since the parting
of the Red Sea. You can't hide it!

300
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,013
- Think what it means to the world.
- I don't work for the world.

301
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,848
- Look...
- No, Scott. I'll take that.

302
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,268
- Here's the detonator.
- Get back to the ship and call the camp.

303
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:13,732
Have Tex radio we've found a flying saucer
in the ice. We're gonna try to get it out.

304
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,443
- What about me?
- Also, ask if Scott can send his story.

305
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,030
- That's all I can do. - You're gonna
grow up to be another Fogarty.

306
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,032
- Where we gonna touch this off?
- Over there.

307
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,701
Have you looked to the west?
That front's moving fast...

308
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,956
and the temperature's dropping too.
- We don't have more than an hour.

309
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,251
- Where do you put those, Bob?
- Right on the surface.

310
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,419
- Tell Stone. Will you, sir?
- Right.

311
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,464
Say, what will this thermite do?

312
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,676
This is S-O-P, standard operating
procedure for removing ice.

313
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,554
Hook this wire up, will you, lieutenant?
It just melts it.

314
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,597
How fast does it work?

315
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,308
It'll uncover the whole saucer
in 30 seconds.

316
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,435
- All ready over here!
- Be right with you!

317
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,480
Better clear the field!
Over near the dog sled!

318
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,858
Gonna get pretty hot
here in a minute.

319
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,917
Hook her up. We'll try the stabilizer
first. Use the other one if we need it.

320
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,129
A few minutes from now
we may have the key to the stars.

321
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,424
A million years of history
are waiting for us in that ice.

322
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,926
- Say when. I wanna get a picture.
- All ready, sir.

323
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,721
- Ready here.
- Let her go, Bob.

324
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,816
- Okay, all clear.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Stay back.

325
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,821
- It's burning under the ice.
- Careful, captain.

326
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,576
What's happening?

327
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,244
Tell me, doctor.

328
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,623
Get down on the ground, everybody!

329
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,976
Everybody all right?

330
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,395
That last explosion was the engine.

331
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,940
Sergeant, will you try your Geiger counter?

332
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,818
- Only a trace.
- That's just residual.

333
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:23,904
It's all gone.

334
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,615
Secrets that might have
given us a new science.

335
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:29,117
- Gone.
- That's just dandy.

336
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,119
Standard operating procedure.

337
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,163
- I should've thought...
- You sure should.

338
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,749
Greatest discovery in history up in flames.

339
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,377
Turning a new civilization
into a 4th of July piece.

340
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,383
Captain, I'm getting something
over here.

341
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,303
- Probably a fragment from the saucer.
- We may salvage something yet.

342
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,229
Hold it, everybody.
I'm getting a reaction.

343
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,314
Let me get a reading.

344
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:02,943
Getting warm.

345
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,696
Hotter now.

346
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,372
Here's where it's coming from.

347
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,919
- What is it?
- Looks like a man.

348
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,463
It's got legs and a head.
I can see them.

349
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,049
Yeah! He must be over 8 feet long.

350
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,385
- Somebody got out of that saucer.
- Or was thrown out.

351
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:31,471
And frozen fast before he could get clear.

352
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,099
- Man from Mars.
- How do you propose getting him out?

353
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,809
- I don't know.
- Use more thermite.

354
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,312
Whatever's quickest.
We don't have much time.

355
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,024
Here's axes. You could chop around
and put the block on the plane.

356
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,233
- I agree.
- Get started.

357
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,737
- Give me room. - Bob, clear the
sled and bring it over here.

358
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,947
Eddie, get the ship warmed up.

359
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,867
And be ready to get out
of here in a hurry.

360
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:20,479
- Pat, I think we made a mistake.
- What do you mean?

361
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:24,107
You ever read this? "Department
of Defense, Office of Public Information."

362
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:27,444
Washington, D.C.
December 27, 1949.

363
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,073
Bulletin 629-49 regarding item 6700...

364
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,409
extract 75,131.

365
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,537
The Air Force has
discontinued investigating

366
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,413
and evaluating reported
flying saucers...

367
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,874
"...on the basis that there
is no evidence."

368
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,253
Probably make you a general
for destroying evidence that they're wrong.

369
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,464
"The Air Force said that all evidence
indicates that the reports..."

370
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:49,883
of unidentified flying objects
are the result of:

371
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,428
"One: Misinterpretation of various
conventional objects."

372
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,389
Didn't look very conventional to me.

373
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,683
"Second: A mild form
of mass hysteria."

374
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,312
That'd be when General Fogarty got to
shaking hands with that thing in the ice.

375
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,983
What are the other reasons?

376
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,609
"Third: That they're jokes."

377
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,070
What did you say the number
of that bulletin was?

378
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:16,410
"629-49, item 6700,
extract 75,131."

379
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,038
Oh. Oh, that one.

380
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,340
- Get on that rope, professor.
- I need a hand over here.

381
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,675
Watch your feet.

382
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,471
Let me tie another rope
to go down.

383
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,391
- Hold it!
- Hold it back now.

384
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,894
Hold it!

385
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,687
Pull, back there!

386
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,193
Keep tight on those ropes!

387
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,653
- Easy.
- Here we go.

388
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,489
- Keep it going.
- Keep it going!

389
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,450
Whoa! Take it easy.

390
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,996
Can't see through the ice too good.

391
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:46,708
Good enough to know that where he came
from, they don't breed them for beauty.

392
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,294
Well, what do we do now, defrost him?

393
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:51,672
This ice will melt pretty soon.

394
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,217
- Can you control the heat in this room?
- No, captain. This is our storeroom.

395
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:57,135
The temperature's constant here.

396
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,763
We don't need to melt it.
We can chip it away.

397
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,141
We're not going to melt it
or chip it. Eddie, open that window.

398
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,936
- We're not allowed to examine it?
- I mean just that.

399
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,397
- This is stupid.
- We're scientists.

400
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:12,067
- And Dr. Carrington's in charge here.
- Hey, Pat, these windows don't open.

401
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:15,362
It's practically certain we'll be asked
by your superiors to study it.

402
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:18,407
- Probably, but we can't permit it now.
- We don't need permission...

403
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:21,118
- Eddie, break that window.
- All right.

404
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,290
Sorry. We already pulled one boner
out in the ice.

405
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,125
We may not know anything about this...

406
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:32,004
but until I receive instructions from my
superior officer, we'll have to mark time.

407
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:35,090
- You have no authority... - If you
want to talk, do it in the corridor.

408
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:39,678
- It's gonna get cold in here.
- At last a sensible suggestion, captain.

409
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:42,222
- Mac.
- Yeah?

410
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,975
Please stay here.
And take four-hour shifts.

411
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,144
- It's hands off for everyone.
- Yes, sir.

412
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,479
- Gonna be warm enough?
- If not, you'll hear me squawk.

413
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,441
- Bob will bring you dinner.
- I could use something to read.

414
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,905
- A nice, quiet horror story.
- Might be kind of tame for you, sir.

415
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,035
- Well, gentlemen?
- Capt. Hendry...

416
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:04,995
- Excuse me, doctor. May I?
- Certainly.

417
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:08,457
In relation to removing the body
from the ice, I'd like to point out...

418
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:12,461
there are organisms that survive
after death, but cold can destroy them.

419
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,129
- In view of that...
- I don't know...

420
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:19,468
But these organisms may be dangerous. They
may be carrying germs from another planet.

421
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,762
- Germs we couldn't cope with medically.
- Thank you.

422
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,223
- I can't agree with you, Dr. Chapman.
- I don't either.

423
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,434
Here's another: We don't know
what effect the air of our Earth...

424
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:31,813
may have on this creature's remains.
- Sort of go up in smoke, like the saucer?

425
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,690
- Nonsense.
- Isn't that far-fetched?

426
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,568
- So is a man from Mars.
- We're getting nowhere.

427
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:40,656
I suggest that Capt. Hendry communicate
with his superior at once.

428
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,617
I'm getting senile.
We should have done that first thing.

429
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:48,830
I'm surprised, captain, that you didn't try
to reach your general on our way back here.

430
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,249
We did. Barnes.

431
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,167
I tried through your
radio operator.

432
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,294
Couldn't get through.
Too much interference.

433
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,798
- I see. My apologies, captain.
- Yes, doctor.

434
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,884
- Hi, captain.
- Hi, Tex.

435
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,886
You sure stirred up a lot of trouble...

436
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,180
- Did you send out my message?
- Sure did.

437
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,058
- Get an answer back?
- This came an hour ago. Can you read it?

438
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,352
- No, you'd better.
- "Fogarty to Hendry:

439
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,689
Withhold newspaper story
until permission from Air Force HQ."

440
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,942
- There you are, Scotty. - Fine. Now
somebody else will get the story.

441
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:22,072
"Remove aircraft from ice at once. Use
thermite bombs if necessary to melt ice."

442
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:26,326
Oh, that's what I like about the Army.
Smart all the way to the top.

443
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,872
- That lets you off the hook for the
thermite... - Take it easy. Go ahead.

444
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,168
"Erect temporary structure to
protect aircraft until my arrival."

445
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:37,504
Here's another one. Came a few minutes ago.
Could only get part of it.

446
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,966
- Go ahead. - "Everything
grounded. Can't... " Something.

447
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,011
- "Want you... " Something or other...
- That sounds like Fogarty.

448
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,305
- Then it got fouled up.
- You're getting nothing?

449
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,474
Nothing. Static's knocking
it right out of the air.

450
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,728
- What about your stuff? - Don't know
if they're getting it. I doubt it.

451
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:54,980
I don't believe it.
Even the Pony Express got through.

452
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,316
- Well, doctor?
- In view of this new situation...

453
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:59,735
- Doesn't alter the old one.
- We disagree with you.

454
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,654
- There's no reason to delay...
- Sorry, gentlemen. That's it.

455
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,157
Tex, I'd like to leave Barnes
to help out all he can.

456
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,284
- Sure.
- Barnes, keep trying to get through.

457
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,119
I wanna get a message
to the general.

458
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:12,789
Tell him the aircraft was completely
destroyed by the thermite bomb.

459
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,626
- Tell him we found a passenger...
- A fellow from Mars? Where?

460
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:16,960
On ice, buddy.

461
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:19,922
Tell him the body's in ice
and Dr. Carrington wants permission...

462
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,424
to remove the body
from the ice for examination.

463
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:25,260
We're standing by for instructions
before further action.

464
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,512
Yes, sir.

465
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,806
- You got anything to add, doctor?
- Yes, one very essential point.

466
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,768
That it's vitally important
that the examination be made.

467
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,020
- By all means. Yeah.
- Add that, Barnes.

468
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:37,940
Thank you, captain.
That's all that concerns me.

469
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,567
When you get your answer,
I expect you to let me know.

470
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,402
Yes, doctor.

471
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,825
Wait till I interview the doctor
about what he thinks of you.

472
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,370
- Probably be good.
- If it isn't, I'll make it good.

473
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,455
Tex, keep trying.
Barnes, if he gets

474
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,791
through, ask again about
clearing Mr. Scott.

475
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,544
Don't try to soft-soap me.
I don't like you any better.

476
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,839
- I'll eat with you, Eddie.
- I'll send you some chow.

477
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:05,384
Captain, I'm gonna check the ship
and tie her down. We'll need our gear.

478
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,928
- This storm may blow for weeks.
- Get the Eskimos to help.

479
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,888
They took off
when they saw that ice.

480
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,182
They'll need a lot of coaxing
to get them back.

481
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,685
If Mr. Scott and the lieutenant
would give me a hand...

482
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:16,478
- I'm a guest.
- I'm an officer.

483
00:32:16,687 --> 00:32:18,689
You can order me around
while carrying the other end.

484
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,316
That'll help a lot, sarge.

485
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:26,071
You know, Pat? I thought
we were gonna have a little trouble.

486
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:29,199
- So did I. - The geniuses
were ready to tear you apart.

487
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,952
They're like kids drooling over
a new fire engine.

488
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,831
Professor Vorhees, come
to the laboratory as soon as possible.

489
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:39,710
- Holding a meeting. Whole thing's weird.
- You know what it reminds me of?

490
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,505
The time I was stuck on Beulen Island
with the old 97th bomber group.

491
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,758
An Army nurse came ashore
and caused the same disturbance...

492
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:50,053
as this guy from Mars has here.
- What happened to the nurse?

493
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,347
She liked it there.

494
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:58,020
- Scotty, what's new?
- What's new? What more do you want?

495
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:02,316
Biggest story ever to hit this planet,
and I run into this human clam.

496
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:04,693
Why are you getting pretty?
You'll never look good to me.

497
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,695
- That's not for you...
- Take it easy.

498
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:10,782
The captain here passes the buck to
General Fogarty, he takes it to Washington.

499
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,910
- Who will Truman ask?
- Margaret.

500
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,538
- I've got to find a way to get to
civilization. - How, for instance?

501
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:20,542
I don't know. Pogo sticks. Kiddie cars.
Gondolas. Dogsleds.

502
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:25,172
- Hey, Barnes, any word come from Fogarty?
- Plenty. Nothing about you, sir.

503
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,134
I think the old man's gone crazy.
Sorry, sir. Shouldn't have said that.

504
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,386
If he hollers louder,
we won't need a radio.

505
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,430
What was the gist
of the conversation?

506
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:36,183
There's been a leak,
and the newspapers...

507
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,852
I knew it! Like water
through a sieve.

508
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,688
Everyone wants information,
Congress, Secretary of State...

509
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:44,441
and especially General Fogarty.
He's having a fit.

510
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,652
- Isn't Anchorage picking us up?
- No, sir.

511
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:49,571
We're picking up them
because they have a stronger station.

512
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:53,659
A picture just came to me:
My editor climbing all over his office...

513
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:58,038
yelling, stamping his feet.
He'll probably shoot himself by midnight.

514
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:01,500
- Take it easy, Scotty.
- Just a minute. I'm not sure you're ready.

515
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,086
You may have missed a spot.

516
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,713
Son, would you like
double guard duty tonight?

517
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,924
No, sir. I wouldn't.

518
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:10,467
- Oh, captain.
- Yes, sergeant?

519
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,471
- Could I see you for a minute, sir?
- Sure.

520
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:21,895
What is it, Bob?

521
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:27,025
It's about Lt. McPherson sitting in there
with that thing in the block of ice.

522
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,735
Getting nervous?

523
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:32,573
Well, he wouldn't want me to tell you, sir,
but he's having kittens.

524
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,075
I haven't heard him squawk like this
since Rechenberg.

525
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,243
Really?

526
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,330
You see, sir, the ice is clearing up,
and we can see that thing pretty good.

527
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:44,585
It's got crazy hands and no hair,
and the eyes...

528
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:48,589
- They're open and look like they can see.
- Bob, I haven't heard you...

529
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,633
It's got me too, sir,
and I wasn't in there very long.

530
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,805
Besides that, it's pretty cold.
I got the lieutenant an electric blanket.

531
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,600
- Captain, I got a suggestion.
- Go ahead.

532
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,686
Instead of four-hour shifts,
we could cut them in half...

533
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:06,773
Okay. You tell Barnes to take over
at 2200.

534
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,027
You take over at 2400,
and I'll relieve you at 0200.

535
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:13,447
- I think you're right, sir.
- I think you are.

536
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:15,449
Thank you, sir.

537
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,714
- I want to talk to you.
- Sure.

538
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:33,425
Pat, what's really going on?

539
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:37,054
Nothing. I just can't agree with your pals.
I had to set a guard.

540
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:39,848
They'd have that thing
up waltzing with them.

541
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:41,517
No, that isn't what I meant.

542
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:43,810
What does that boogeyman
in ice really mean?

543
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,979
I don't know, Nikki.

544
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:51,193
Well, does it mean that we'll have visitors
from other planets dropping in on us?

545
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,946
Do we have to return the call, or...?
Oh, jeepers.

546
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:57,908
- I know. Yesterday I'd said it was crazy.
- I'd say it's crazy now.

547
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:01,203
Forget it. Tomorrow it'll
all seem different.

548
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:05,624
I suppose so. I like the way
you handled this whole mess, Pat.

549
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:09,253
I'd just as soon not.
You know, it's funny. I'm glad I was here.

550
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,046
I am too.

551
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:13,006
You're much nicer when you're...

552
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,842
When you're not mad.

553
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:19,054
Sounds promising. How about that
business of beginning over again?

554
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:24,560
Well, I think I'll buy you a drink
this time. I think you've earned it.

555
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:29,439
- That is, if you want one.
- You can tie my hands if you wanna.

556
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:32,442
- That might not be such a bad idea.
- You mean that?

557
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,821
- Well, you suggested it.
- All right. I'll bring a rope.

558
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:50,419
- You want another one, Pat?
- Don't you think you could untie me now?

559
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,713
I don't know. What's the matter?

560
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,301
You gals. If a guy asks you to dinner and
buys you a drink and tries to kiss you...

561
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,720
- Why are you laughing?
- You never kissed me.

562
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,597
- I haven't tried.
- How do you know?

563
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:05,601
- Oh, stop bringing that up. - Never
mind. You haven't. Maybe if you'd...

564
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,728
- Go on with what you were saying.
- What?

565
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,605
About the dinner and the drink.

566
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,649
Well, if the same man asked you
to have 30,000 dinners...

567
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:15,694
Then he's not a wolf anymore?
That's fine philosophy.

568
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:20,532
So you really want your hands untied.
Just when everything was nice and peaceful.

569
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:25,454
You know, I'm glad we decided
to start over again. I like it.

570
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,625
- I like that too.
- Talk about Japanese tortures.

571
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,836
No, not at all. I think this
was a great idea.

572
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,963
Come here.

573
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:38,008
Well, look at you...

574
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:42,471
sitting there like a civilized man instead
of grabbing around like a throwback.

575
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,433
If you weren't tied up, I wouldn't dare
have told you how much I liked you.

576
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:51,772
You know, Pat, the trouble with you is that
you don't know anything about women.

577
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,607
What a woman wants is to...

578
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,567
Is to...

579
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:59,154
- How long have you been loose?
- Long enough.

580
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:03,033
It's been a very interesting evening.
Good night, Miss Nicholson.

581
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,497
- Pat, if you walk out on me like this...
- I wouldn't go, except I gotta check up.

582
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,256
Get a good night's sleep.

583
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,258
I'll see you in the morning.

584
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:23,679
It's the eyes being open that gets you.
Makes you feel so...

585
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:27,975
Hi, Pat. Barnes just got here. Sure glad
I'm not looking at that guy anymore.

586
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,560
- All set, Barnes?
- Yes, sir.

587
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:33,856
- Got an electric flying suit and coffee.
- Bob will relieve you at 2400.

588
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:37,109
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

589
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:20,319
That's better.

590
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,128
Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry!
Capt. Hendry.

591
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,130
What's the matter, corporal?

592
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:26,134
Where's the captain? I've got to tell him
that thing's alive. I saw it.

593
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,679
It chased me. It's not dead. It's...

594
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,472
Capt. Hendry!

595
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:34,852
That thing's alive, sir. I saw it.
I shot at it. I hit it, I know it.

596
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,189
Nothing happened. It kept coming at me,
making a noise like a cat meowing.

597
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:44,695
If you could have seen those hands and
those eyes! You've got to do something...

598
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:50,617
Mac, Bob, get some guns.
Now, Barnes, what happened?

599
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:53,287
I'm sorry, sir. I don't
know exactly, but all

600
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,622
of a sudden it was alive
and coming at me.

601
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,251
I shot at it and hit it.
Nothing happened, so I ran...

602
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:00,794
- Easy, easy.
- I'm sorry, sir.

603
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:04,506
- Here, captain.
- Take care of him. Will you?

604
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:08,635
Get back to sleep.

605
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,309
Get back with the rest of them.

606
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,661
- What could've...?
- Kid said he was alive. I believe him.

607
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,539
I knew it. All the time I was here,
I could feel it.

608
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:42,002
Here's what did it.
This blanket was on. It's still warm.

609
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:50,385
- He got out of here, all right.
- Get parkas, boots and a flashlight!

610
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:54,348
- Listen. They'll tear him to pieces.
- We must save him.

611
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:58,602
Hold it, doctor. You'll freeze to death
in five minutes. Use your head!

612
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:03,190
- I expect you're right. I was overanxious.
- Look over here, captain!

613
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:12,157
- I think I've got yours.
- May I have one, captain?

614
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:13,784
Better let us go, doctor.

615
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,207
- Doc, can you see anything out there?
- Not much.

616
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,212
- You all set?
- Let her go.

617
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:33,322
Captain, it would help if you, any of you,
would describe what you saw out there.

618
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:36,491
It was too cold to see well,
but the dogs had him down.

619
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:40,120
- He got up with three hanging on his arm.
- He threw one at the rest.

620
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,956
- Two were dead. - Looked like
they'd been through a chopper.

621
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,043
- Where did you find the arm?
- Partly under one of them.

622
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,171
Could dogs tear off an arm?

623
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:52,007
This kind of an arm.

624
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:54,301
Be careful, doctor.
Those barbs are sharp.

625
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,678
Seems to be a sort of
chitinous substance.

626
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:57,846
Speak English.

627
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,933
Something between a beetle's back
and a rose thorn.

628
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,809
- Thorn-fingered?
- Amazingly strong.

629
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,811
- Very effective as a weapon.
- Very.

630
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:09,358
We don't have to worry about that. An arm
off and out in that cold, he's dead now.

631
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,944
Got along fine in a block of ice
for 24 hours.

632
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,489
- Pretty spry for a guy with 12 dogs
on him. - And for losing an arm.

633
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:18,700
- I'm losing my mind.
- Amazing, isn't it?

634
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,995
- Amazingly strong.
- Strange.

635
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:25,541
- I'm sure of it.
- That is blood on the hand. Isn't it?

636
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:28,252
- Yes, but not his.
- Probably from one of the dogs.

637
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:32,256
There's no blood in the arm,
no animal tissue.

638
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:37,135
Dr. Stern, would you have a look at this
under the microscope?

639
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:44,268
No, Mr. Scott. I doubt very much if it
can die, as we understand dying.

640
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:47,729
- Holy cat!
- Yes.

641
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:49,439
Well, doctor?

642
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:55,904
No arterial structure indicated.
No nerve endings visible.

643
00:44:57,281 --> 00:45:00,033
Porous, unconnected cellular growth.

644
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,622
Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like
you're trying to describe a vegetable.

645
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:09,293
- I am. Are you getting all of this?
- Oh, for Pete's sake!

646
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:14,506
You know, doctor, that could be why
Sgt. Barnes' bullets had no effect.

647
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:17,676
- That's right. - Merely holes
drilled into vegetable matter.

648
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:19,803
This green fluid here.

649
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,806
- Like plant sap.
- We'll probably find it has a sugar base.

650
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:25,350
Please, doctor, I've got to ask this.

651
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:27,895
It sounds like, well...
Just as though

652
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,647
you're describing some
form of super carrot.

653
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,734
That's nearly right, Mr. Scott.

654
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:37,029
This carrot, as you call
it, has constructed an

655
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:40,115
aircraft capable of flying
millions of miles...

656
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,160
propelled by a force
as yet unknown to us.

657
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:47,247
- An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles.
- It shouldn't.

658
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:50,751
Imagine how strange it would have seemed
during the Pliocene age...

659
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:53,962
to forecast that worms,
fish, lizards that

660
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:57,216
crawled over the Earth
would evolve into us.

661
00:45:57,341 --> 00:45:59,510
On the planet from which
our visitor came...

662
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:03,847
vegetable life underwent an evolution
similar to that of our own animal life...

663
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:07,226
which would account
for the superiority of its brain.

664
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:12,272
Its development was not handicapped
by emotional or sexual factors.

665
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:15,359
Dr. Carrington, you won the Nobel Prize.

666
00:46:15,526 --> 00:46:19,029
You've received every kind of kudos
a scientist can attain.

667
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:22,908
If you were for sale, I could get a million
bucks for you from any foreign government.

668
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:27,204
I'm not, therefore, gonna stick my neck out
and say you're stuffed full...

669
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:31,875
of wild blueberry muffins. But I promise
you, my readers are gonna think so.

670
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,503
Not for long, Mr. Scott.
Not if they know

671
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:37,256
anything about the flora
of their own planet.

672
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:41,093
You mean there are vegetables
right here on Earth that can think?

673
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,722
A certain kind of thinking, yes.
You ever hear of the telegraph vine?

674
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,683
- Not recently.
- Or the...

675
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:51,270
- Is it the acanthus century
plant, Dr. Stern? - Yes.

676
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,355
Go ahead, doctor. That's your field.

677
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:59,069
Well, the century plant catches mice,
bats, squirrels, any small mammals.

678
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:03,490
Uses a sweet syrup as bait,
then holds onto its catch and feeds on it.

679
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,909
What's the telegraph vine?

680
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:10,122
The vine, research has proven, can signal
to other vines of the same species...

681
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:13,208
vines 20 to 100 miles away.

682
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:16,837
Intelligence in plants and vegetables
is an old story, Mr. Scott.

683
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,132
Older even than the animal arrogance
that has overlooked it.

684
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,009
- That's one for Ripley.
- Look here.

685
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:26,763
I took this from under the soft tissue
in the palm of the hand.

686
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,099
- A seedpod.
- Seedpod?

687
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:34,813
Yes. The neat and unconfused
reproductive technique of vegetation.

688
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,150
No pain or pleasure as we know it.

689
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:40,319
No emotions...

690
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:41,820
no heart.

691
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:46,700
Our superior. Our superior in every way.

692
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,286
Gentlemen, do you realize
what we've found?

693
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:54,541
A being from another world as different
from us as one pole from the other.

694
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,461
If we can only communicate with it...

695
00:47:57,628 --> 00:48:02,466
we can learn secrets that have been
hidden from mankind since the beginning...

696
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,772
Holy cat. It's moving.

697
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,233
- Miss Nicholson.
- Yes, doctor?

698
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:23,403
At 12:10 a. M., the hand became alive.

699
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:30,327
The temperature of the forearm
showed a 20-degree rise.

700
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:33,914
Because of this rise in temperature,
I believe it was able to ingest...

701
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,834
the canine blood with which
it was covered. I believe...

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,630
You mean...
You mean it lives on blood.

703
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,634
- This is the best we could find.
- This should work.

704
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:48,804
- Where are you going?
- To find our visitor, if we can.

705
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:50,722
One moment, captain!

706
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:54,768
Check the storeroom again.
Bolt any outside doors.

707
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,312
Captain, when you find
what you're looking for...

708
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:59,565
remember it's a stranger
in a strange land.

709
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,234
The only crimes were those
committed against it.

710
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:06,822
It woke from a block of ice, was attacked
by dogs and shot by a frightened man.

711
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:12,911
- All I want is to communicate with it.
- Fine, provided it's locked up.

712
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,207
If we catch him, let me take his picture
before somebody makes a salad of him.

713
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,751
Sure, Scotty.

714
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:25,883
- Bob, get up on there.
- What's up? Looks like a lynching party.

715
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,135
- Have any visitors?
- Not a soul.

716
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:32,931
I got part of a message from the general.
He said to wait on Mr. Scott's story.

717
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:35,684
What's the difference?
Nothing's going out anyway.

718
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,395
- What are you looking for?
- Couldn't come in here.

719
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:39,980
- Who?
- The man from Mars.

720
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:41,773
You mean he's alive and loose?

721
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,319
Keep your door locked. Use your axe
if you have to. Gun's no good.

722
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:48,280
What do you mean the gun's no good?
Now, look...

723
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:53,202
Eddie.

724
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:57,206
Hold it, captain.

725
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:22,689
- There's something in here, all right.
- You're a little off base.

726
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:26,068
That's the mineralogy lab.
Radioactive isotopes are in there.

727
00:50:26,235 --> 00:50:29,947
Your Geiger's reacting to a roomful
of uranium ore samples.

728
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:31,949
Yeah.

729
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:46,129
- This door's locked.
- Dr. Stern has the key.

730
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:48,257
- Oh, yes.
- What's in here?

731
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:51,885
The greenhouse. The Eskimos have
a weakness for our strawberries.

732
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:55,722
- Strawberries at the North Pole.
- Excuse me.

733
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:02,604
Mac. Bob.

734
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,148
Look under these tables.

735
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,949
Bob, check that outside door.

736
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,289
- Door's locked, sir.
- Nothing up here.

737
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:22,916
We're still batting zero.

738
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,545
- Well, doctor?
- Captain, I...

739
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:29,631
- Nothing up that other corridor.
- Any suggestions, doctor?

740
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:32,593
- He's obviously not inside.
- We'll start looking outside...

741
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,678
- Close the door, please.
- Never mind.

742
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:39,349
Captain, half an hour outside now is all
we can stand. We'd better do it in relay.

743
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:44,062
- You're right, Dr. Chapman. We'll work
out... - Would you close the door, please?

744
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,440
We have to tell General Fogarty
what happened.

745
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:48,233
We're liable to become famous.

746
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,445
So few people can boast
they've lost a flying

747
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:54,364
saucer and a man from
Mars all in one day.

748
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:58,619
Wonder what they'd have done to Columbus if
he'd discovered America, then mislaid it.

749
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,579
Bunch of butterfingers.

750
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,624
Gentlemen, I just happened to notice...

751
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,376
Look at these moles.

752
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,800
They're wilted.
The only thing that could...

753
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:16,762
A blast of icy air
if that rear door was opened.

754
00:52:16,929 --> 00:52:19,139
- Have a look at that lock, professor.
- Yes.

755
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:24,102
- 10 or 15 seconds of exposure would do it.
- Exactly.

756
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,897
What would that lead you to?

757
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:29,733
That it may have been...

758
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:33,570
- In here.
- Without a doubt.

759
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:37,616
Dr. Carrington, you were right.
The lock's been forced back into position.

760
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:42,371
The key's gone. Someone has entered
and gone and locked the door from...

761
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:45,499
- From the outside.
- Look. See how it glistens in the light?

762
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,960
It's a smear of...

763
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:52,214
- Plant sap. From the wounded arm?
- You don't suppose...?

764
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:54,550
Open it, please.

765
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:08,939
- One of the sled dogs.
- Not even cold yet.

766
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:15,153
- Doctor, doesn't it seem kind of...?
- Shrunken. Is there any blood in there?

767
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,072
- None.
- No blood.

768
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,366
- No blood?
- Its blood has been drained.

769
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,994
Everything falls right into line.

770
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:24,788
What could be more
natural for such a being

771
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,499
than seeking out the
only open earth nearby?

772
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:32,087
It came here for refuge, heard us and ran.

773
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:35,382
- It's been here. It will come back again.
- We better tell...

774
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:39,011
I don't agree. It's far better
if science rather than the Army...

775
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:43,891
- Are you sure this is the best thing to
do? - I'm sure we can communicate with it.

776
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,685
It's wiser than we are.
It's our only chance

777
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,062
to talk to it, to
learn so many things.

778
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:52,357
- Dr. Carrington is right.
- Surely you understand that, Stern.

779
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:55,527
Will you two stand guard
here with me tonight?

780
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,154
- Surely, doctor.
- All right.

781
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:00,616
Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Olson
what we've found.

782
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:04,494
Ask them to come back
and relieve us in the morning.

783
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:08,707
And tell them, please,
to confide in no one.

784
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:27,809
- Any luck, captain? - Lee, you
better get some more coffee ready.

785
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:30,979
- Find anything, captain?
- Not a sign.

786
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,774
- Barnes flushed a polar bear.
- Sure did.

787
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:37,152
- Scare you?
- Not after I saw it was only a bear.

788
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,863
- Too cold out there for that.
- You didn't find anything.

789
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,033
I didn't think you would.
When we lose them, they stay lost.

790
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,329
Not that it makes much difference.
Nothing's coming in on the radio.

791
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:51,291
- Tex, you got something?
- General Fogarty's running a temperature.

792
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,294
This came in clear 10 minutes ago,
then it got fouled up again.

793
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:56,755
"Fogarty to Hendry:
Take all precautions to

794
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:59,258
preserve aircraft carefully
until my arrival."

795
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:03,428
Same to same. "Use same precautions
with corpses of any occupants."

796
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:07,266
Same to same.
"Forward detailed description of aircraft.

797
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:10,686
Measurements, approximate weight
and so forth. Important."

798
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:14,439
"Fogarty to Hendry: Why haven't
you answered? Want immediate answer."

799
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:18,986
Same to same. "Radio silence unnecessary.
Reference message Fogarty to Hendry."

800
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:21,029
Acknowledge immediately.

801
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:23,156
"Waiting report. Silence confusing."

802
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:25,158
Same to same. "Acknowledge."

803
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:27,202
- Same to same...
- Acknowledge at once.

804
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:31,874
- I gather he wants to hear from me. -
There's nothing for me? I don't believe it.

805
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,251
How can a man get to be
a general without...?

806
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,673
In the greenhouse...

807
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,091
See...

808
00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:45,137
- Barnes, watch that corridor.
- Bring the first aid kit.

809
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:49,266
- Captain, this is my job. - Bob,
better start warning the rest of camp.

810
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:53,770
- Does that speaker system work from here?
- Yes. The left switch runs to all rooms.

811
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:56,607
Attention, everybody in camp.
Bolt your doors.

812
00:55:56,773 --> 00:56:00,986
Our visitor has returned and is dangerous.
Stay where you are until notified.

813
00:56:01,153 --> 00:56:02,487
Stay where you are.

814
00:56:09,286 --> 00:56:12,623
- Easy. It'll be all right.
- What happened, doctor?

815
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:15,459
In the greenhouse,
I was working. I couldn't see.

816
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:19,087
Then a blast of cold air,
and I heard Olson scream.

817
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:22,674
- When I turned, the thing struck at me.
- Go on.

818
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:26,512
I don't remember. My head...
I must have fallen.

819
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:30,140
When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach.
They were...

820
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:34,478
Give him some more of that. Get those axes.
Go ahead, doctor.

821
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:40,192
They were both hanging from the beams
upside down, dead. Their throats were cut.

822
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:42,027
- I crawled...
- Was it there when you left?

823
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:43,904
I couldn't see.

824
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:48,408
- Here you are, sir.
- Wait, Pat! I want to get a picture.

825
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,254
Wait a minute. He could get out
of the greenhouse through the outside door.

826
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,091
- We can get to it through the
generator room. - You two go with him.

827
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:07,594
- You mean go in?
- Seal the door with anything you can find.

828
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:09,721
That's better.

829
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:14,309
- Easy. Give them time to get in there.
- Pat, I want a picture.

830
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:17,646
- You get back with the rest.
- Don't be silly.

831
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:20,107
- It'll cost you a drink.
- I'll buy him a beer.

832
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:28,240
- Ready, Bob?
- No, but go ahead and open it.

833
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:46,091
Get something to prop this door, something
short enough to get under this bolt!

834
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:50,888
- Get your picture, Scotty?
- No. The door wasn't open long enough.

835
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,265
- Want me to open it again?
- No!

836
00:57:53,432 --> 00:57:56,768
- Bring a hammer and some spikes!
- Hit that in, will you?

837
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:01,148
There. That ought to do it.

838
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:05,152
Doctor Chapman, you're sure
there's no other way out? No windows?

839
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,404
- Only the front and back doors.
- The walls solid?

840
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:10,073
- Corrugated iron.
- You don't think that...?

841
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:18,540
You found a dog in there, bled white
by our visitor. Why didn't you report it?

842
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:22,085
- It wasn't necessary.
- It was necessary to leave friends to die?

843
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,837
I posted them as guards...

844
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:26,590
I looked in. They're
hanging upside down like

845
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,884
in a slaughterhouse.
Wish you'd seen it.

846
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,969
- Can't we do something?
- They're dead.

847
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:33,430
Let's see nobody joins them.
Doctor, you're

848
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,849
limited to your room,
lab and the mess hall.

849
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:39,520
You have no authority of any kind.
No right to assume...

850
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,855
You better move along.

851
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:49,780
We've got the rear door blocked.
If he gets out...

852
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:53,116
he'll have to dig through
oil drums and a couple tons of snow.

853
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:58,247
- Bob, next time raise the sights a little.
- I was too busy to think about that.

854
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:01,375
We're gonna have to set up
a guard here in the corridor.

855
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:06,213
- Two-hour shifts. We'll need volunteers.
- Count me in, captain.

856
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:16,974
You sent for us, doctor?

857
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:24,314
You said you had news for us, doctor.

858
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:28,235
Yes, yes. I...

859
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:33,323
Gentlemen, we find ourselves in a battle.

860
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:37,411
I'm not referring to the minor argument
with Capt. Hendry...

861
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:40,789
but this creature from a new world.

862
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:44,585
Two of our colleagues have died,
a third is injured.

863
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:47,337
Those are our losses,
and there may be more.

864
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,549
This creature is more powerful
and intelligent than we are.

865
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:53,886
He regards us as important
only for his nourishment.

866
00:59:54,052 --> 01:00:00,225
He has the same attitude toward us
as we have toward a field of cabbages.

867
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:03,187
That is our battle.

868
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:08,901
Only science can conquer him. All other
weapons will be powerless, only...

869
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:11,987
There must...

870
01:00:12,154 --> 01:00:17,159
There must be a way. I've been trying to...

871
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:22,706
Sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept.

872
01:00:22,873 --> 01:00:24,875
It's difficult...

873
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,794
Difficult to talk.

874
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:32,424
- Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?
- Doctor, you need some rest.

875
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,927
Yes, I know, but...

876
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,388
Please read my notes.

877
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:42,351
"At 9:00 p. M., I placed the seeds
taken from the severed hand of X..."

878
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,269
in four inches of earth.

879
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:47,105
I saturated the earth...

880
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:52,694
I saturated the earth with two units
of plasma taken from our blood bank.

881
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:56,198
The condition of the dog found
in the greenhouse indicated blood...

882
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:59,368
was a primal factor
in the cultivation of the seeds.

883
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,912
At 2:00 a. M...

884
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:06,542
"At 2:00 a. M., the first sprouts
appeared through the soil."

885
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:11,296
- Five hours.
- Yes. I used another two units of plasma.

886
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:16,635
At 4:00 a. M., the sprouts began
to take on definite form.

887
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:19,304
I came to the conclu...

888
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:24,977
I see by your faces you don't believe me.

889
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:29,648
Well, you may judge for yourselves.

890
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:49,710
Oh, no. It isn't possible.

891
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:53,130
- It reproduces itself.
- Amazing speed.

892
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:56,633
This would bear out
Capt. Hendry's impression.

893
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,470
When he saw the creature in the
greenhouse, it had grown a new arm.

894
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:04,516
- This pulsating, doctor?
- As though they were breathing.

895
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:08,854
- Yes. Human plants.
- Superhuman.

896
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:12,149
- All this because of the blood plasma?
- That's correct.

897
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:16,945
Notice these, closer to the source of
the plasma. While these, farther away.

898
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:20,574
- How many units have we?
- Enough, I hope.

899
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,869
Would you care to listen to them,
Professor Wilson?

900
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:26,580
Yes, thank you. I should.

901
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:46,558
Well?

902
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:51,855
Almost like the wail
of a newborn child that's hungry.

903
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:54,525
- That's the way I would have described it.
- Doctor?

904
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:57,528
- Yes, Miss Nicholson?
- Would you mind very much if I...?

905
01:02:57,694 --> 01:03:02,115
- Will you be needing me anymore?
- No. Just finish typing my notes.

906
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:06,161
Return them to me.
Let no one see them.

907
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:09,623
Doctor, I think you should
get some sleep.

908
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,500
There's too much to do.

909
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:15,379
- Your mind can't work if you're exhausted.
- My mind's still clear.

910
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:20,050
No, it isn't, doctor. You aren't thinking
of what's happening in the greenhouse.

911
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:23,679
He's growing those seeds in there
using blood. Just as you are.

912
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:27,975
You've seen what one creature like that
can do. Just imagine a thousand.

913
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,602
- I have imagined it.
- Arthur...

914
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:34,273
what if that aircraft came
not just to visit the Earth...

915
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:39,736
but to conquer it? To start growing
some kind of horrible army?

916
01:03:39,945 --> 01:03:44,241
- To turn the human race into food for it?
- Many things threaten our world...

917
01:03:44,408 --> 01:03:47,703
new stars, comets shooting...
- But those are theories.

918
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,789
- This is an enemy here.
- There are no enemies in science...

919
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:55,460
only phenomena to study.
We are studying one.

920
01:04:07,848 --> 01:04:09,266
Come in.

921
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:17,691
- Hello, Pat.
- Hi. Nikki, I want to ask you something.

922
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:21,904
Has anybody up here been hurt lately?
Anybody shot, stabbed or operated on?

923
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:25,324
No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse
has been our first diversion.

924
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:30,162
I brought up 35 units of blood plasma
two months ago. What's become of it?

925
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:33,874
- Why do you want to know?
- Why are they not giving it to Dr. Stern?

926
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:38,337
They're giving him blood transfusions
instead of plasma. Two live donors.

927
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:41,673
What's Carrington doing with
35 units of blood plasma?

928
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,592
I guess...

929
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:48,388
I guess you'd better take a swing at
my chin and have a look at those notes.

930
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,308
I should be trying to stop you.

931
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,733
So that's what he's been doing.

932
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,695
Thanks. Thanks for not stopping me.

933
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:09,117
Pat, would you remember something?
He's tired.

934
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:13,497
He hasn't slept since you found
that thing. And he's not thinking right.

935
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:16,542
I know him. And he doesn't think
the way we do anyway.

936
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:21,296
But he's found something no one can
understand. Until he can solve it, he'Il...

937
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:25,425
- You know, like a kid with a new toy...
- Only this toy's liable to bite him.

938
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:26,927
Thanks again.

939
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,854
Where's Dr. Carrington?

940
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,940
I'm sorry. I have no authorization
to give you any...

941
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:42,985
- I'm very busy.
- I know you're busy, doctor.

942
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:45,612
I understand you've been gardening.
Where are they?

943
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:48,323
- Why?
- This way to the nursery, Pat.

944
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:53,787
I don't tolerate intrusions
into my laboratory. Don't touch.

945
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:56,957
This is what your colleagues
are doing in the greenhouse.

946
01:05:57,124 --> 01:06:00,043
- This is an improvement.
- What happened was not my fault.

947
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:03,005
We've read your notes.
You should have consulted us.

948
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,924
I have the help I need.
Your opinion has not been asked.

949
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:10,387
It has by Capt. Hendry. And I've given
it to him. I'll repeat it for you.

950
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:13,307
We're facing something
unpredictably dangerous.

951
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:16,810
The creature in the greenhouse
is obviously multiplying itself.

952
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:19,062
We have no way of finding out
how much.

953
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:22,024
It will need more blood
and will try to obtain what it needs.

954
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:25,736
- It's imprisoned and harmless.
- How can you be sure of our safety?

955
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:27,529
Or the safety of the world?

956
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:32,326
Think of 1000 such creatures. 10,000. It
must be destroyed, this progeny with it.

957
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:34,203
- No.
- We can burn these.

958
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:37,122
- What about that thing in the greenhouse?
- You're like frightened boys.

959
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:41,418
- You're right. I am frightened.
- Any destruction would be an outrage...

960
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:43,587
a betrayal of science.
- It may be.

961
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:47,007
- But I'll sleep better if we get rid
of it. - Captain, Barnes finally...

962
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:48,842
got a message through.
Here's the answer.

963
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:50,677
- Go ahead.
- "Fogarty to Hendry:

964
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:56,350
Carrington informs me Martian alive. Keep
it alive and protect it against injury.

965
01:06:56,517 --> 01:07:00,187
"Under no circumstances take action
against it until my arrival."

966
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:05,067
You have your orders, Capt. Hendry.
I consider them sane and intelligent.

967
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:08,195
- But, Tex, what about me?
- Not a thing, Scotty.

968
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:12,866
- What do we do, Pat?
- Try changing the Army's mind.

969
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:27,339
Hey! Hey, it's me, Eddie!

970
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:34,221
- What are you doing here?
- We can't take it out there.

971
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:36,849
Drop the idea of guarding
from the outside.

972
01:07:37,015 --> 01:07:39,184
The wind's blowing so hard
you can't see.

973
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:41,478
It can go through walls
as easy as doors.

974
01:07:41,645 --> 01:07:44,982
- How could it get through iron walls?
- Use a can opener.

975
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:49,486
- We're dropping the outside guard.
- Put that hand in some ice water.

976
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:52,406
- Who's out in the corridor?
- Stone and Wilson, sir.

977
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:56,410
Barnes, tell them they're the only ones
on guard. Tell them to watch it.

978
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:02,332
- Tex?
- Here I am.

979
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:05,294
You won't be long.
We're dropping the outside guard.

980
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,713
Come join the rest of them
in the mess hall.

981
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,925
I'll be all right. I've got the door
braced, and there's no outside windows.

982
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:14,595
All right. If you want to be brave.

983
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:18,724
- Well.
- Pat, what are we gonna do?

984
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:23,312
Anybody around here
want some coffee?

985
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:25,105
No, but you can come in.

986
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:28,817
That's the reason I brought it.
I was hoping you might ask me in.

987
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,696
- Who wants some?
- I could use a half.

988
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:36,658
- What were you saying, Scotty?
- I was wondering... That's enough. Thanks.

989
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:42,539
What happens if our boyfriend gets lonely
and strolls around and ends up in here?

990
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:45,000
- I've been figuring that.
- Nothing hurts it.

991
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:48,337
- What do you do with a vegetable?
- Boil it.

992
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:53,675
- What'd you say?
- Boil it. Stew it. Bake it. Fry it.

993
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:56,094
- That makes sense.
- Cold doesn't bother it.

994
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:59,348
Maybe Dr. Carrington will ask it
to crawl into a boiler.

995
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:03,268
- Maybe you could borrow a flamethrower.
- Captain, I got a crazy idea.

996
01:09:03,435 --> 01:09:05,896
We got lots of kerosene
and we could...

997
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:15,489
- Point three. Point four.
- Here's where we start cooking.

998
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:18,700
Point five. Point six.

999
01:09:19,076 --> 01:09:21,954
That thing's out of the greenhouse.
Stay together.

1000
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:26,166
Point nine. What about throwing
kerosene on it and setting it on fire?

1001
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,001
- We can try.
- Here's a full can.

1002
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:30,671
I'll take it. We'll need
something to put it in.

1003
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:32,798
- Here's a pail.
- Here's another.

1004
01:09:32,965 --> 01:09:34,883
- One point two.
- We need one more.

1005
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,261
- Pat, this one will work all right.
- Good.

1006
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:39,304
Watch that cigarette, lieutenant.

1007
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:41,723
How we gonna set it on fire,
rub sticks together?

1008
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,976
- There's a Veri pistol in my bag.
- I'll get it.

1009
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:47,855
If it comes in, you wet it down.
Mac, touch it off. And don't miss.

1010
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:50,440
- You be ready if it needs more.
- You're right.

1011
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,442
- Shut up.
- One point three now.

1012
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:56,029
- You know how to shoot that?
- I saw Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.

1013
01:09:56,196 --> 01:09:59,950
- One point four.
- Come here. Get in the corner.

1014
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:02,578
Hold this in front of you.
Stay by the light switch.

1015
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:06,164
One point five. One point six.

1016
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:09,376
- What was that?
- It sounded like a window.

1017
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:11,795
- One point eight.
- Turn off those lights.

1018
01:10:11,962 --> 01:10:15,340
One point nine.
The needle's hit the top.

1019
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:48,081
- Put the fire out!
- I am!

1020
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:50,250
Watch it, captain!

1021
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:58,091
- Block that window!
- Hey, Scotty!

1022
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:15,817
- This will make your hand feel better.
- Thank you.

1023
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:21,240
- This ought to be enough kerosene.
- Get it ready.

1024
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,242
- How's it coming, Barnes?
- It'll be okay.

1025
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:27,538
What makes me mad is he didn't do it.
I busted it falling over the bunk.

1026
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:29,915
Listen, we want you all to stay here.

1027
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:33,126
We found a way to fight this thing,
but burned out a room.

1028
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:37,422
- It's not hurt much, from the way it took
off. - About as much effect as a hot foot.

1029
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:38,924
It's sure to come back.

1030
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:42,761
We don't want to burn the whole place.
So we're going after it.

1031
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,514
It probably went to the greenhouse.
We'll start there.

1032
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:49,351
Meantime, stay here.
Watch the door into the hallway.

1033
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:52,896
- Keep your eye on the Geiger counter.
- Here are the fire extinguishers.

1034
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,858
- Who's your electrical expert?
- That's my line.

1035
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:59,736
- Can you hook into the intercom system?
- We can take one from any room.

1036
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,322
- I can help.
- Mac, we'll be in the radio room.

1037
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,825
Let us know when you're ready.
You all right?

1038
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:07,786
- Yeah. I'd like to tag along.
- Haven't you had enough?

1039
01:12:07,953 --> 01:12:10,497
If I start burning up again,
who'll put out the fire?

1040
01:12:10,664 --> 01:12:13,166
We're very proud of our captain.

1041
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:20,174
Now, look, put one of the intercoms
here. That'll take care of this end.

1042
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,428
Put another down here at the junction.
See if they work through the mess hall.

1043
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,889
You said you were gonna
use kerosene again.

1044
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:31,185
- Know anything better? - Something
hotter. Why not use electricity?

1045
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:35,355
- You mean your lighting system?
- No, we can hook in a new transformer.

1046
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:38,317
- It will give us plenty of amps.
- Enough to burn him?

1047
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:41,653
- More than enough.
- Could you use leads to two poles?

1048
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,198
- If you insulate the poles.
- Sounds good.

1049
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:47,868
Bob, give him a hand.
Come on, Tex. You go to work.

1050
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:50,829
Get Anchorage if you can.
Tell them the whole story.

1051
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:54,917
Tell them we're in bad shape
and to bring hand grenades, mortars...

1052
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,585
flamethrowers, anything.

1053
01:12:56,752 --> 01:13:00,005
Tell them if I don't send a story,
I'm gonna shoot myself.

1054
01:13:00,172 --> 01:13:03,091
- Better comb your hair first.
- What hair?

1055
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:06,011
- Hey, say that again.
- Oh, Nikki, not you too.

1056
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:07,554
- He's sensitive.
- You too.

1057
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:09,765
- I got hair.
- Doesn't make you prettier.

1058
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:11,808
- No, your breath.
- I'm sorry.

1059
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:14,603
- He's sensitive about that too.
- I've been upset.

1060
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:19,858
- You ninnies. Look. That's what I mean.
- Hey, look. You too.

1061
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,653
- It's getting cold.
- The heat must be off.

1062
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:24,196
It is off.

1063
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:28,408
It's not getting oil.
See if it's the same across the hall.

1064
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,663
- Tex, where do these heaters get oil?
- Around behind. Outside.

1065
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:36,708
- Pat, heat's off in the mess hall!
- No.

1066
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:39,378
- No more oil coming in.
- It's off in there too.

1067
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:42,381
- Could the tank be empty?
- Filled day before yesterday.

1068
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:45,175
The main line could be plugged.
Better fix it.

1069
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:47,928
Probably run into our visitor,
who'd be waiting for you.

1070
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:49,721
We underestimate this guy.

1071
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,391
- Trying to freeze us out, huh?
- That isn't gonna be hard.

1072
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:55,143
- It's down to 40 degrees.
- It's 60 below outside.

1073
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:57,688
- How long will these rooms hold heat?
- Half an hour.

1074
01:13:57,855 --> 01:14:00,399
- By then, we'll be stiff.
- If no one goes out...

1075
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:02,442
won't it think of something else?

1076
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:07,781
It'll think that our only chance to keep
warm is electricity. Heaters, blankets.

1077
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:11,159
It could break the circuit,
cut a line, except at the source.

1078
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,120
- The generator room.
- Get them all in there.

1079
01:14:13,287 --> 01:14:16,957
- I'll tell Tex.
- Bring food, medicine, blankets, clothes.

1080
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:21,712
- Bring our flying clothes. - Most got
burned. I'll see what I can salvage.

1081
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:24,381
- Get the transformer hooked up to that.
- It's cold in here.

1082
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:26,258
- The thing's turned the heat off.
- What?

1083
01:14:26,425 --> 01:14:28,051
- What'll we do?
- I don't know.

1084
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:31,930
The next thing's electricity,
so everybody's in the generator room.

1085
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:34,308
Did you do a good job
on the outside door?

1086
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:37,394
- Houdini'd find it tough getting in.
- He'll come through here.

1087
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:40,856
It's the only way. Got any fence wire
strong enough for the voltage?

1088
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,025
- Whole rolls of it.
- That'll work.

1089
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,735
- What?
- Lay it on the ground.

1090
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:48,197
A lead overhead and on each side.
When it gets to the spot, juice him.

1091
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:49,823
- I don't get you.
- Where's the wire?

1092
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:51,116
- Down here.
- Give me those.

1093
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:54,661
- What are you doing?
- We'll rig an electric flytrap for him.

1094
01:14:54,828 --> 01:14:55,829
What do you mean?

1095
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:58,373
- Scotty, get me a hammer and nails.
- Sure.

1096
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,250
Better get out of the way.

1097
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:05,547
- Looks as if the situation's well in hand.
- I've given all the orders I'm gonna give.

1098
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:09,134
If I thought that were true,
I'd ask you to marry me. Here's your coat.

1099
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:10,677
I wanna keep my mind open.

1100
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:12,429
- Hammer and nails.
- Down there.

1101
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:16,225
- Where do you want us?
- In the generator room. Move along.

1102
01:15:16,391 --> 01:15:20,103
- Sorry, changed my mind. It's all off.
- Keep moving, everybody.

1103
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:23,524
- I want another word with you.
- No time now. Move along.

1104
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:27,027
Make way. Clear this out.
Clear this place.

1105
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:28,737
- Where are those cutters?
- Here.

1106
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:31,281
- Where's your Geiger counter?
- I got one too.

1107
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:33,742
Go to the assembly room.
If you get anything, come running.

1108
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:36,537
- Get me a pair of gloves.
- Use mine.

1109
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:57,015
- Leave enough to hook the overhead wire.
- Got plenty.

1110
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:05,023
- Here we are, lieutenant.
- Yeah, that ought to give us a ground.

1111
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:08,485
- There she is, captain.
- Down to five degrees now.

1112
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:11,488
- Perfect for skiing.
- Better get rubber boots, Scotty.

1113
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:14,074
- Why?
- Insulation when they turn the juice on.

1114
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:16,201
- Oh, yeah.
- There's a pair back here.

1115
01:16:16,368 --> 01:16:18,537
- Where?
- Wait. You won't need any boots.

1116
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:21,456
When it comes, go back.
You don't belong out here.

1117
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:25,711
I didn't belong at Alamein or Okinawa.
I was just kibitzing.

1118
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:29,673
I also write a very good obituary.
Just ignore me, please.

1119
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,842
- Capt. Hendry.
- Go ahead.

1120
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:34,428
Just hooked this up.
Checking if it works.

1121
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,305
Fine. Watch your Geiger counter.

1122
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,516
- Mac, did you hear?
- Every word. I hope that's all I hear.

1123
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:43,103
- So do I.
- Here's another message from Washington.

1124
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:48,859
"Use every means to protect lives,
but take no steps against your prisoner."

1125
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,360
Our prisoner.

1126
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:54,406
- You can't ignore orders.
- Testify to that at my court-martial.

1127
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:58,493
You're robbing science of the greatest
secret that's ever come to it.

1128
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,538
- Go back.
- Knowledge is more important than life.

1129
01:17:01,705 --> 01:17:05,167
We've only one excuse for existing.
To think. To find out. To learn.

1130
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:08,086
What can we learn from that,
except a way to die?

1131
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:11,798
It doesn't matter what happens.
Nothing counts except our thinking.

1132
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:14,551
We fought into nature.
We've split the atom...

1133
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:16,970
That sure made the world happy.
Didn't it?

1134
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:20,390
We owe it to the brain of our species
to stand here and die...

1135
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:23,644
without destroying a source of wisdom.
- Capt. Hendry.

1136
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:26,438
- Civilization has given us orders.
- Get him out of here.

1137
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:28,941
Oh, you fools. You'll never hurt it.

1138
01:17:29,107 --> 01:17:32,402
- Go ahead.
- I'm getting a Geiger counter reaction.

1139
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:35,072
- What's your reading?
- Point two, but steady.

1140
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:38,200
Watch it. Tell us any change.
Mac, anything your way?

1141
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:39,868
- Not a glimmer.
- Watch it.

1142
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,787
Here's the operating switch.

1143
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:45,832
- How can it get cold so quick?
- Keep moving around.

1144
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:49,711
- It must be zero.
- It was. Next stop, five below.

1145
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:53,966
Come on, Mr. Martian, and get some
nice Scotch blood. One hundred proof.

1146
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:57,594
- Nothing like it for babies.
- Tell him to cut it out.

1147
01:17:57,761 --> 01:18:02,391
No, no. Let him go on. I like
goose pimples. They keep me warm.

1148
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:05,853
Did you get a picture of that thing
on fire?

1149
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:09,231
No. I shot one while I was
falling backward over the bed.

1150
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:11,608
Probably got the ceiling
and my big feet.

1151
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:14,695
Capt. Hendry, going up a little.
Point four now.

1152
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:18,574
- Hang on. Mac, any change?
- Just the same. Only colder.

1153
01:18:19,283 --> 01:18:22,870
- Means he's coming by the mess hall.
- Excuse me. I got an idea.

1154
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:24,371
- What?
- Here we go again.

1155
01:18:24,538 --> 01:18:28,500
Your boy's pretty smart. He might see
these wires and think it over.

1156
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:32,045
- Yeah.
- If he thinks too long, we're cold meat.

1157
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:36,049
- What if we met him by the junction?
- Let him see us there and chase us?

1158
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,926
The less light, the better.

1159
01:18:38,093 --> 01:18:41,597
Turn off this light and this one here.
Don't tell me I'm right.

1160
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:44,433
Capt. Hendry, going up.
Point eight now.

1161
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,935
- I'm getting some too.
- It's showing here.

1162
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:50,522
- Both of you, back here. Come running.
- Halfway there.

1163
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:53,442
If you speed up that generator,
can you get more out?

1164
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:57,237
- Certainly do no harm to try.
- Bill and Tex, go with him. Nikki too.

1165
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,489
- No.
- Good luck to you.

1166
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:02,034
What's the matter?

1167
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:06,121
- I was wishing we'd tested this thing.
- What if we haven't enough voltage?

1168
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:08,207
- Keep swinging at its arms.
- One point two.

1169
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:10,167
- It's on its way.
- I got a worry.

1170
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,920
Report from the front,
McPherson has a worry.

1171
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:14,505
- This is no joke.
- What?

1172
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:18,175
- What if he can read our minds?
- He'll be mad when he gets to me.

1173
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:21,094
- One point four.
- Keep moving around, you guys.

1174
01:19:21,303 --> 01:19:22,888
Keep it quiet.

1175
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:28,352
I remember the first execution I ever
covered. Ruth Snyder and Judd Grey.

1176
01:19:28,519 --> 01:19:31,313
- Did you get a picture?
- No. They didn't allow cameras.

1177
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,483
- One point six and going up.
- Don't move till he sees us.

1178
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:37,986
Give him a chance to look.
Leave me room to reach that switch.

1179
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:41,114
Stay away from the walls
when he hits the juice.

1180
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,242
- Everybody got rubber boots on?
- Yes, sir.

1181
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:45,160
One point eight.

1182
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,248
I heard something.

1183
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,713
It's getting near the top.

1184
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:02,719
Get your posts!

1185
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:10,102
All right. Ease back.

1186
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:26,618
- What the...?
- The juice is off!

1187
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:28,453
Carrington's turned off the generator.

1188
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,957
Bob, bring a flashlight. Eddie,
hold him off as long as you can.

1189
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:36,837
- Watch out. He's got a gun.
- Keep away. Keep away.

1190
01:20:37,004 --> 01:20:39,298
Keep away. I won't
allow you to destroy...

1191
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:42,593
Turn on that generator!
Get back here, Eddie.

1192
01:20:56,773 --> 01:20:58,942
Eddie, get back!
Stay away from that wire!

1193
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:02,196
I'm your friend. I have no weapons.
I'm your friend.

1194
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:05,949
You're wiser than I. You must understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

1195
01:21:06,116 --> 01:21:09,453
Don't go farther. They'll kill you.
They think you'll harm us.

1196
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,289
But I want to know you,
to help you. Believe that.

1197
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:14,374
You're wiser than anything on earth.

1198
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:17,836
Use that intelligence. Look
and know what I'm telling you.

1199
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:22,132
I'm not your enemy.
I'm a scientist who's trying...

1200
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:24,218
Hold it.

1201
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,431
Wait until he gets right
in the middle of it, sir.

1202
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:35,521
He's gotta be on that walk, captain.

1203
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:45,948
Wait till he gets right
in the middle, sir.

1204
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:23,360
- Oh, that's it. Stop. Turn it off.
- Let it go. We don't want any part left.

1205
01:22:48,427 --> 01:22:51,138
Well, you can get a picture now, Scotty.

1206
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:21,335
- This will take a minute to warm up.
- Okay.

1207
01:23:21,502 --> 01:23:24,880
Is there any reason now
why I can't send my story?

1208
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:27,799
- Only take five minutes.
- I guess it's okay.

1209
01:23:27,966 --> 01:23:30,302
You're looking better to me
than you used to.

1210
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:32,304
- All done, Pat.
- Get everything?

1211
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:35,432
Burned everything in Carrington's lab
and the greenhouse.

1212
01:23:35,599 --> 01:23:38,352
- Burned the arm too.
- How is Dr. Carrington?

1213
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:40,521
He's got a broken collarbone
and a headache.

1214
01:23:40,687 --> 01:23:42,564
I'm not getting enough voltage.

1215
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:44,858
- I'll check the generator for you.
- Good.

1216
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:48,111
- Anybody want some coffee?
- No, but you can come in.

1217
01:23:48,278 --> 01:23:51,615
- You better have some. You look tired.
- He should look tired.

1218
01:23:51,782 --> 01:23:54,660
- He's had two things on his mind.
- We've only had one.

1219
01:23:54,826 --> 01:23:58,080
- Our worries are over, while
our captain... - Shut up.

1220
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:00,415
Isn't there something you
can do about it, Nikki?

1221
01:24:00,624 --> 01:24:04,336
I don't know. You know, I'm getting
pretty fed up with the North Pole.

1222
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:06,755
- How much does a captain make?
- Not much.

1223
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:08,507
That's a good start. Go ahead.

1224
01:24:08,715 --> 01:24:10,676
- Enough to support two?
- Not nearly.

1225
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:13,470
- Captain, you get flight pay.
- Some for each dependent.

1226
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:16,181
- We can handle that.
- I won't be railroaded into anything.

1227
01:24:16,348 --> 01:24:17,850
I've got an idea.

1228
01:24:18,016 --> 01:24:21,228
- This is gonna work.
- You ought to settle down.

1229
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:23,689
- There you are.
- It'd be much better for us.

1230
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:26,775
Sure. Our captain always
getting into trouble.

1231
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:29,987
- Remember that night in Honolulu?
- That was pretty bad.

1232
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:32,656
- I don't know what they're talking about.
- He should light somewhere.

1233
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:37,870
- See, they know what's best for you.
- Here we are. Plenty of voltage now.

1234
01:24:39,204 --> 01:24:44,251
Anchorage, from Polar Expedition 6.
Can you hear me? Over.

1235
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:49,631
- Anchorage, reception clear. Stand by.
- Press the button and speak, Scotty.

1236
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:53,760
Tell General Fogarty we've sent for
Capt. Hendry. He'll be here in minutes.

1237
01:24:53,927 --> 01:24:57,890
- Roger. Over.
- Are there any newsmen there? Over.

1238
01:24:58,056 --> 01:25:01,393
- The place is full of them. Over.
- All right. Here's your story.

1239
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,271
North Pole, November 3rd.
Ned Scott reporting.

1240
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:08,358
One of the world's greatest battles
was fought and won by the human race.

1241
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:11,236
A handful of American soldiers
and civilians...

1242
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:13,906
met the first invasion
from another planet.

1243
01:25:14,072 --> 01:25:17,659
A man by the name of Noah once saved
our world with an ark of wood.

1244
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:21,872
Here, a few men performed a similar
service with an arc of electricity.

1245
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:25,626
A flying saucer, which landed here,
and its pilot have been destroyed.

1246
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:29,087
But not without casualties among
our own meager forces.

1247
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:33,008
I'd like to bring to the microphone
the men responsible for our success.

1248
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:39,515
But Capt. Hendry is attending
to demands over and above the call of duty.

1249
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:42,518
Dr. Carrington, leader
of the scientific expedition...

1250
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:45,479
is recovering from wounds
from the battle. - Good for you.

1251
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:50,025
And now, before giving you the details
of the battle, I bring you a warning.

1252
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:52,694
Every one of you listening to my voice...

1253
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:57,115
tell the world. Tell this to everybody
wherever they are:

1254
01:25:57,282 --> 01:26:03,664
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.
