1
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:44,083
<i>The Vietnam peace talks</i>
<i>are continuing here in Paris today...</i>

2
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:49,111
<i>... against the background of what to do</i>
<i>about the release of American POWs.</i>

3
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:52,189
<i>In the United States,</i>
<i>sentiment is running high...</i>

4
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,389
<i>... for a complete accounting</i>
<i>for all of the POWs and MIAs...</i>

5
00:02:56,797 --> 00:03:01,063
<i>... those listed as Missing in Action,</i>
<i>before any treaty is signed.</i>

6
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:04,196
<i>The prisoners, men such as these...</i>

7
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:08,808
<i>... are Americans who have been captured</i>
<i>during the 10 years of fighting in Vietnam.</i>

8
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:11,206
<i>The Undersecretary of State,</i>
<i>Conrad Morgan...</i>

9
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:13,906
<i>... is the chief American delegate</i>
<i>to the talks.</i>

10
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:18,247
<i>This morning, outside the mansion</i>
<i>in which the talks are being held...</i>

11
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:21,216
<i>... Morgan told reporters</i>
<i>that he is optimistic.</i>

12
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,448
<i>I now sincerely believe...</i>

13
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:25,492
<i>... the North Vietnamese delegates</i>
<i>are dealing in good faith...</i>

14
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,153
<i>... and that significant progress</i>
<i>can now be made.</i>

15
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:30,423
<i>As chief delegate to these talks...</i>

16
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:33,022
<i>... are you saying a final agreement</i>
<i>has been reached?</i>

17
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,658
<i>What I'm saying is what I said.</i>

18
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:39,263
<i>The situation is e</i>x<i>tremely delicate,</i>
<i>but significant progress can now be made.</i>

19
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:41,603
<i>Is that clear? I certainly hope it is...</i>

20
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:45,611
<i>... because I would appreciate</i>
<i>those of the press getting that straight.</i>

21
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:50,048
<i>What if Kuong Yen decides to throw</i>
<i>new roadblocks into these negotiations?</i>

22
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,109
<i>I suppose we'll have to</i>
<i>take things one step at a time.</i>

23
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:57,623
<i>There is one more question the American</i>
<i>public deserves to have answered.</i>

24
00:03:57,691 --> 00:03:59,386
<i>What about the Missing in Action?</i>

25
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,586
<i>Have you and Kuong Yen</i>
<i>discussed that at all?</i>

26
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,220
<i>Of course we have discussed that...</i>

27
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:06,323
<i>... and we will continue</i>
<i>to discuss that question.</i>

28
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,836
<i>But I'm sure you can all realize,</i>
<i>that is of such a sensitive nature...</i>

29
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:12,064
<i>... I'm not at liberty to go into that now.</i>

30
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:16,075
<i>I can only say this: I'm very hopeful</i>
<i>that we will arrive at a solution.</i>

31
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,303
- What the hell are you doing in my room?
- You told me to meet you here.

32
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,872
Could have waited in the lobby.
Turn that goddamn thing off, please.

33
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:25,077
I'm enjoying it.

34
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:28,679
<i>Mr. Morgan, please,</i>
<i>can we have a statement before you...</i>

35
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:30,187
Harolds?

36
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:33,616
- Come on, bring that shit in here!
- Coming.

37
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:39,459
I'm not as nimble as I used to be.

38
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,999
Nor as coordinated.

39
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:49,738
Actually, Conrad,
I have always been rather clumsy.

40
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:56,481
When you get that stuff cleaned up,
make me a scotch, will you please?

41
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:59,347
So, the war is over, Mr. Undersecretary?

42
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:02,683
You're practically a national treasure.

43
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,514
Son of a bitch.

44
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,487
Which son of a bitch is that?

45
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:10,425
Hope they cut his balls off.

46
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:14,860
- Give Harolds a pair of scissors.
- When the time's right, I'll do that myself.

47
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,469
Sounds like your private meeting
with Kuong Yen...

48
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:22,941
...was what you guys in State
called "a frank discussion of the issues."

49
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,578
What the hell is this,
some kind of a joke to you?

50
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,910
- You could say so.
- It's not to me.

51
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:29,812
Somebody's gotta take it seriously.

52
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:32,943
I told 'em I didn't need
any goddamn CIA help on this thing...

53
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,885
And they shove me down your throat!

54
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:39,449
We've been through this before, Morgan.
Now, what the hell is it this time?

55
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:44,524
How many of your CIA people
are the VC holding?

56
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:45,758
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,857
Save that bullshit for Congress.
How many?

58
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:49,458
150, maybe. Why?

59
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,332
They're dead.

60
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:56,165
The fact that we have positive information
to the contrary is irrelevant.

61
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,539
He wants a sacrifice.

62
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,614
Speak intelligently, Morgan.

63
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:04,810
As an addendum to the peace terms,
Kuong Yen wants a sacrifice.

64
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,819
Call Omaha and get a flock of sheep.

65
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,151
He claims he's lost a lot of family
to you people.

66
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:12,453
This isn't important, of course,
but I also think he's a psychopath.

67
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,127
That makes him unique in this business,
doesn't it?

68
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:19,598
In any case, we agree to write off
those people as Missing in Action...

69
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,898
...and they agree to call off the war
and give us a lot of other people back.

70
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,231
And you agreed?

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,107
I didn't agree to anything.

72
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,274
You practical son of a bitch!

73
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:36,975
You're gonna cash in those people's lives
just for a shot at the Nobel Peace Prize!

74
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,348
Saunders, don't get sanctimonious
with me.

75
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:41,978
Nobody's gonna win anything
when this war's over.

76
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,990
If the VC want 'em dead so bad,
why don't they just kill 'em?

77
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:48,050
They won't because they're worth
too much as a bargaining point.

78
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:50,221
Wrong. They'll kill 'em...

79
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,924
...as soon as they sign the treaty...

80
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:57,332
...or they'll hold them as MIA
till they're through interrogating them.

81
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:00,868
In any case, what I'm trying to say is
we have to at least try...

82
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,876
...to get some of those people out of there.

83
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:06,810
I hate to think I've been misjudging you.

84
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,246
That would be unfortunate.

85
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:12,979
What do you call the commandoes...

86
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,886
...you're holding
under the Phoenix umbrella?

87
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:17,523
Black Tigers.

88
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:21,891
Who the hell thinks up names like that?
Black Tigers!

89
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:24,863
Actually, a group of us did,
some years ago.

90
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,393
Don't let anybody kid you, Harolds.
It's a great name.

91
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:33,838
- Can they get your people out?
- I don't know, it's very risky business.

92
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:37,233
Take at least a couple of weeks
for an operation like that.

93
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,402
Forty-eight hours.

94
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,910
Forty-eight hours? Right.

95
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:50,921
What about staging a major operation
in the middle of your peace talks?

96
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:53,453
I'll worry about the diplomacy.

97
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:03,926
I get the feeling I'm offending
some sensibility in you.

98
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:08,539
The American public is crying for peace.
I intend to achieve it for them.

99
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:12,812
Like I said,
you're practically a national treasure.

100
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,028
Saunders, when this war is over...

101
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,795
...you should get a job
as an advance man for cancer.

102
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,364
In support of the disease or the cure?

103
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:40,736
I sometimes find it difficult to understand...

104
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,901
...the American custom of joking
during a time of crisis.

105
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:46,872
How certain are you of your intelligence?

106
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:50,045
To be perfectly honest with you,
Maj. Mhin...

107
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:53,847
...the only thing certain about intelligence
is uncertainty.

108
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,982
As usual, you're a big help.

109
00:08:57,357 --> 00:09:00,793
This better be as important
as your boys at headquarters said it was.

110
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:02,385
Let's go, Mhin.

111
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:10,394
What do you think Prince will say when
we come walking in there after him?

112
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,200
"You came a long way, Fred,
to collect your bread."

113
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:16,572
- That's what he's going to say.
- You'd better believe that, baby.

114
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,043
What makes them think Hanoi
will sit still for this kind of stunt?

115
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,707
It must make sense
or they wouldn't be sending us.

116
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:26,274
One camp. What good could it do?
The POWs are in dozens of camps.

117
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:28,821
It's the camp with the most guys in it.

118
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:33,087
I do not see how a raid at this time
can do anything but harm the negotiations.

119
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:36,421
Major, I thought
the goddamn war was over.

120
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:38,891
So did I, but it's not. What's your point?

121
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:42,594
The point is we don't want to be
the last guys killed in this war...

122
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,728
...if there's someone else available.

123
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,466
I think they've got us down
for second to last.

124
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,904
Whatever happened to the good old days
when Randolph Scott and John Wayne...

125
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:55,778
...were happy to get their asses blown off
for the good ol' US of A?

126
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:57,840
Who the hell is Randolph Scott?

127
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:01,510
Randolph Scott Key:
dude who wrote the national anthem!

128
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,546
Oh, that Randolph Scott!

129
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:06,524
You can joke if you want,
but I've got a score to settle.

130
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,925
That's the spirit, Gordie, an ear for an ear!

131
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,395
I said not to joke around
about my ears, didn't I?

132
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:14,598
You're gonna have a hard time
finding an ear that size.

133
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:18,331
Just give me a couple whole heads.
I'll use what I need.

134
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:21,434
What do you know? We can go first class!

135
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:23,567
- You gonna serve coffee, Randolph?
- Sure!

136
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,577
I want Lola Falana to serve my coffee!

137
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:28,170
- Gonna be a movie on this flight?
- Yeah.

138
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:56,990
Mhin?

139
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:17,821
- Major, over here!
- Get in!

140
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:55,687
Gordie, he's hit!

141
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:57,953
Get him.

142
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:03,162
- Come on!
- All right, let's get out!

143
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:06,964
- Get him!
- Come on!

144
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:09,734
- What's the matter?
- Goddamn thing won't start!

145
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:14,706
Come on!

146
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,551
Get out! Move out! Let's go!

147
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:25,281
Come on!

148
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,211
Come on, Gordie. We gotta run!

149
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:50,606
Where we running, Mike?

150
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:53,946
Are we late for the train or something?

151
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,696
Where the hell are the choppers?

152
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:13,738
The choppers aren't here.
Why don't we take the train?

153
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:16,696
Radio.

154
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:22,335
Nighthawk, this is Tiger 1. Over.

155
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,751
Somebody's going to pay for this screwup.

156
00:19:35,226 --> 00:19:36,625
I think I know who.

157
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:38,822
Yeah, us.

158
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:46,027
Nighthawk, this is Tiger 1.
We're at LZ and waiting for pickup. Over.

159
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,368
I don't get it.

160
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:57,777
Everything went wrong by the numbers
and that takes planning.

161
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,150
What are you talking about?

162
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,620
I'm saying we've been set up.

163
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:15,330
Where are the choppers?

164
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,929
I just told you, Gordie, it was a screwup.

165
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,533
I like choppers. They're like birds.

166
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:25,906
- You like birds, don't you?
- Sure I do, Gordie.

167
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:28,676
Jesus.

168
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,813
Where are the choppers?

169
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:34,545
I like choppers. They're like birds.

170
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:37,986
I shot a bird once.
My daddy took my rifle away...

171
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:42,322
- Take care of him, Mike.
- Yeah.

172
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:45,658
- What do we do now?
- Survive.

173
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,527
Lou, the point. Walker, the rear.

174
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,090
- Where are you going, Mike?
- Going home.

175
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:54,002
- What do I do, walk out?
- lf you spot a taxi, flag it down.

176
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,986
- How'd it feel?
- A hell of a lot better!

177
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:55,387
Let's clean her out
and I'll give her another try.

178
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:03,232
I think our troubles with this baby
are just about history.

179
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,361
You spend one more minute with this car,
I think that baby there will be history.

180
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,766
Damn, can you believe
I forgot all about her?

181
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:14,368
Any man who forgets her
needs a lube job and oil change real bad.

182
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:16,309
I can't wait to get her on the rack.

183
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,650
Goddamn it, Booker, what's a girl
have to do to get your attention?

184
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:27,182
I'm sorry, Kelly.

185
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:37,362
You're really going to be mad.
I've got a class to teach in one hour.

186
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:38,826
Shit.

187
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,176
Come on, Booker, get in.

188
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,259
And so, as history slowly places it
into some kind of perspective...

189
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,858
...a few things about the Vietnam War
have become clear.

190
00:24:14,137 --> 00:24:16,298
It was a war
that never should have begun...

191
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,568
...in a country
we never should have entered.

192
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:23,011
And its thousands of victims died
without really understanding why...

193
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:28,183
...mainly because the reasons for the war
were beyond any rules of logic.

194
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:35,186
On Wednesday, we'll sing patriotic songs
and pretend I said none of the above.

195
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:38,720
- Good lecture, man.
- Thank you.

196
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:40,695
- See you, Booker.
- Okay.

197
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,101
I hope you didn't mind my sitting in.

198
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,875
It seems a long way from the '60s,
doesn't it?

199
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,417
Yes, it does.

200
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,484
Can I take you to lunch?

201
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,589
I don't eat lunch. Who are you?

202
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,287
Let me take you to dinner and find out.

203
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:13,829
- You do eat dinner?
- I've been known to.

204
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,225
I'm on an expense account.

205
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:21,636
You're a reporter.

206
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:24,799
Why else would I fly all the way out
from Washington to see you?

207
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:26,341
I don't know.

208
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:30,476
Pick me up at 7:00?

209
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:32,207
7:00 is too late.

210
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,448
For us?

211
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:37,244
For dinner. How about 5:30?

212
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,045
At 5:30 in Washington,
they're still out to lunch.

213
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:42,752
In Washington, they're always out to lunch.

214
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:46,762
Besides, I have a feeling
this might be a very interesting evening.

215
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:51,058
You're the professor, Professor.

216
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,749
- That's it, mister.
- That's a good job.

217
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,387
Too bad you weren't born black.

218
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:16,220
There might have been a future
in this for you.

219
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:19,022
Hey, mister, you forgot your newspaper.

220
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:22,364
- 19 and 25.
- Thank you, my man.

221
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:08,035
Quite a car.

222
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,665
Not exactly ideal for going
from stoplight to stoplight, is it?

223
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:14,869
- Only if they're 200 miles apart.
- Pretty much for a grad student.

224
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:19,711
I do test driving, and like a damn fool,
I took the car instead of the salary.

225
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,688
What the hell is he trying to do?

226
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,889
Hang on!

227
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:29,011
You son of a bitch,
what the hell's going on?

228
00:29:29,085 --> 00:29:30,814
Relax! The accelerator pedal stuck!

229
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,913
- What?
- I said, "The accelerator pedal stuck!"

230
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,015
Why didn't you kill the engine?

231
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:39,152
Because I thought
I could kick the pedal loose.

232
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,741
What the hell was that all about?

233
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,172
- I wish I knew.
- I think I need a drink.

234
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:59,577
- Any place in particular?
- Your place. As long as you drive carefully.

235
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:04,714
<i>Are most of your days usually</i>
<i>as e</i>x<i>citing as this one?</i>

236
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:08,620
<i>Not quite, but I've got a feeling</i>
<i>things are about to change.</i>

237
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,225
<i>If you've got something to say, say it.</i>

238
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:10,691
<i>If you've got something to say, say it.</i>

239
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:14,923
You were on a top-secret mission to rescue
some POWs at the end of the war.

240
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,265
No response?

241
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,392
I get it.
You're writing a book about the war.

242
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:26,936
Something like that.

243
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,606
When you arrived at the camp,
there were no POWs, only Vietcong.

244
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,704
You lost most of your men.

245
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,344
I wonder who told you about that.
It was all top secret.

246
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:39,813
Shall I go on?

247
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,482
Are you married?

248
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:47,255
After the raid, you were to be met
and flown to safety with the POWs.

249
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:48,989
The helicopters didn't show...

250
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:52,521
...so you marched out of the jungle
with five of your men.

251
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,996
Do you fool around?

252
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:07,075
It took you three weeks
to get out of the jungle.

253
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,517
Then you were, as they say,
"debriefed" in the hospital for two months.

254
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:14,487
Nothing was ever printed
about that strange sortie.

255
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:16,781
Why not?

256
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:19,124
How about something to eat?

257
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:23,255
What ever happened to those POWs
who weren't there to be rescued?

258
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,864
Have they been returned? Are they MIA?

259
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,657
Are they dead?

260
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,038
Will anybody admit that they ever existed?

261
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,240
- Will you answer any of those questions?
- Now, what can you do with one egg?

262
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,816
Watch out.

263
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:52,960
Nice selection. We can saut� these.

264
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:55,518
I tried it once. I didn't like it.

265
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,395
How about some frozen halibut?

266
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:04,102
Your unit was a part of Operation Phoenix.

267
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:07,741
Its job was to neutralize,
I believe they called it...

268
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:10,073
...the Vietcong undercover agents.

269
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:13,079
You were also assigned
to rescue our own POWs.

270
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,343
You're very intense for a girl with such...

271
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:25,492
How about one egg
with oysters and sauerkraut?

272
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,630
Are you going to tell me anything?

273
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,698
There's really not much to tell.

274
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:38,400
In the hospital, they told us the VC
intelligence had cracked our security.

275
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:40,270
Reasonable possibility.

276
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:42,502
They said our choppers
had been shot down.

277
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:44,135
Reasonable possibility there.

278
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,409
Then by the time they got replacements
to us, there was nothing but bodies.

279
00:32:48,483 --> 00:32:49,973
That's what they said.

280
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,485
And like an obedient soldier,
you believed them.

281
00:32:53,087 --> 00:32:56,056
In the hospital,
I told myself the war was over.

282
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:58,115
I lived through it, now put it behind you.

283
00:32:58,192 --> 00:33:01,992
I could spend years trying to find out
if somebody set us up.

284
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:04,390
And if I found him, well...

285
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:08,363
...he most likely would be someone
I couldn't get to anyway.

286
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:10,495
What if he were someone you could get to?

287
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:15,504
I decided no to waste my life
to avenge something I'd survived.

288
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:19,074
It's over and I want to keep it that way.

289
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:23,079
I don't believe you really feel that way.

290
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:26,749
- Why are you asking all these questions?
- I can't tell you.

291
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:28,789
Then stop asking them.

292
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:32,382
I met a man at a cocktail party
in Washington.

293
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:36,863
He was what the newspapers refer to as
"a high-ranking government official."

294
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,694
He was also very drunk.

295
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:41,727
The scotch seemed to break
some barrier in his mind.

296
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,800
- He mentioned the Black Tigers.
- How's the sauerkraut coming?

297
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:49,032
Coming nicely, thank you.

298
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:51,536
John T. Booker:

299
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:55,338
A man taking his Ph.D.
in Political Science...

300
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,813
...who used to be a member of the CIA.

301
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,218
- Sounds schizophrenic.
- I was never a member of the CIA.

302
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:04,215
The Black Tigers were CIA.

303
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:10,587
I didn't know the Freedom of Information
Act was that effective.

304
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,860
It isn't, but I am.

305
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:17,869
What do you think of Conrad Morgan
being named Secretary of State-Designate?

306
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:20,402
- Nothing.
- Doesn't interest you?

307
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,475
I'm only interested in finding out
what you're not telling me.

308
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:30,673
Who's going to tell who first
what he or she isn't telling?

309
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:35,821
Maybe I'll tell you after dinner.

310
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,059
Or maybe in the morning.

311
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:42,460
How about the morning?

312
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:46,218
- Bad dream?
- Yeah.

313
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:48,425
What?

314
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:05,139
- You don't sleep well, do you?
- No.

315
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:07,176
I don't either.

316
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:13,615
Did I keep you awake?

317
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,045
I didn't mind.

318
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,857
- I'll make it up to you.
- You already have.

319
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:27,363
How do you turn this thing off?

320
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,535
Why does anyone who doesn't sleep well...

321
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:35,736
...have an alarm that sounds like Big Ben
that can't be turned off?

322
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,940
- Where are you going?
- To run.

323
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:44,582
I run, too.

324
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:47,014
Well, come along.

325
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,947
I think I had sufficient exercise last night.

326
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,554
- Breakfast?
- lf you can find anything.

327
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,122
Of course, you don't eat breakfast.

328
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,431
I'll see you in exactly 27 minutes.

329
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:13,105
When I get back,
we can talk about breakfast, maybe.

330
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:55,979
Hey, Murray.
Why don't you get an honest job?

331
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:00,690
What, and give up my cloak and dagger?
John, I have to talk to you.

332
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:03,591
Pull over. Gas is expensive.

333
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,605
I know better than to ask
where you've been...

334
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:20,770
...but that cigar smells like pure Havana.

335
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:23,974
Fringe benefits.
John, what did you and Marilyn talk about?

336
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:26,408
Do I know her?

337
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:29,249
The reporter who seems to have
more answers than questions.

338
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:32,154
You wouldn't be talking about a writer
named Margaret?

339
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:36,024
She told me "Marilyn."
Next guy'll get "Myrna" or "Marilee."

340
00:38:36,095 --> 00:38:38,757
She's obviously in the "M's."
What did you tell her?

341
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:43,335
I told her about a long walk I took
a couple of years ago.

342
00:38:43,402 --> 00:38:44,733
What did you tell her?

343
00:38:44,803 --> 00:38:48,534
Somebody told her more about
that mission than even you and I know.

344
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:50,541
That scar is ugly, but it's healed.

345
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:52,805
It's about to be reopened.

346
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:58,312
"Operation Sandstone."
I don't recall that one.

347
00:38:58,517 --> 00:39:00,985
There was no Operation Sandstone.

348
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:03,145
You see that line with "D.A." on it?

349
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:07,056
It means that sometime during
an operation which never happened...

350
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:10,289
...it was confirmed
that you were a double agent.

351
00:39:10,563 --> 00:39:13,031
See that "Sanction Authorization 1"?

352
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:16,501
There's a contract out on me.

353
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:17,968
- Correct.
- Why?

354
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:21,495
I think the reporter found out something
she shouldn't. What'd she say?

355
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,267
Someone talked to her about the mission.
I didn't want to hear about it.

356
00:39:25,344 --> 00:39:27,812
That's why ostriches die young.

357
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,145
Whoever talked to her
has evidently decided to rectify his error.

358
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:34,778
Who the hell can get into
this machine and put out a hit on me?

359
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,416
Only the President, the Secretaries...

360
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,550
...and a few
Undersecretaries of Defense and State.

361
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:44,352
The directors of the FBI, the CIA...

362
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,264
...the Chairman
of the National Security Council...

363
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,824
...and the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

364
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:52,301
Thank God it's nobody important.

365
00:39:54,139 --> 00:39:56,334
Jesus, this is crazy.

366
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,610
It's not just you, John.

367
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:05,182
I had reason to check out all five of those
guys who came out of that jungle with you.

368
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,687
Holly Washington is dead.
I think Lou Goldberg is, too.

369
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:13,754
- Was it your people?
- I don't know.

370
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,524
Well, find out.

371
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:20,294
Look, first I get a tip on Holly and Lou.

372
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,902
Then I meet a girl who knows more about
that goddamn raid than anyone should.

373
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,962
Then there's the fact that
I'm the one that sent you on it.

374
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:30,801
It isn't on that computer,
but it's a good bet...

375
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:33,640
...that my name is there
with the rest of the Tigers.

376
00:40:34,046 --> 00:40:37,038
- Can't you warn them? Protect them?
- You can.

377
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:42,684
Last known names and addresses.

378
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,149
Mhin Van Thieu?

379
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,658
What is his name doing on here?

380
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:54,225
He was killed on that last raid.

381
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,493
Evidently not.

382
00:40:57,069 --> 00:41:00,232
First listed as MIA, then POW...

383
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:02,239
...released at the end of the war.

384
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:05,736
We obviously paid him off
by bringing him into this country.

385
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:09,508
He's cooking for some Peking-style
restaurant in San Francisco...

386
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:11,879
...specializing in fried dumplings.

387
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,977
That's great. What else do you know
that you may have forgotten to tell me?

388
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,082
There is something,
but I just can't remember what it is.

389
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:24,085
That helps a hell of a lot.

390
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:27,155
Look, John,
there's a lot I can't help you with.

391
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,763
The company has too many eyes.

392
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,361
So you're going to have to
warn those guys yourself.

393
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:36,973
This is my life
you're screwing with, Murray.

394
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:38,974
It's mine too, friend.

395
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:45,031
<i>Hello?</i>

396
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,237
<i>- Gordie Jones, please.</i>
<i>- He's not home.</i>

397
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:50,846
<i>- Where is he?</i>
<i>- At his Uncle Sheffield's Travel Town.</i>

398
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,047
<i>Can I call him there?</i>

399
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:55,612
<i>He ain't got no phone there.</i>

400
00:42:56,255 --> 00:42:59,247
<i>God, we don't owe you any money,</i>
<i>do we, mister?</i>

401
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,553
<i>Look, you can find him at his uncle's.</i>

402
00:43:13,605 --> 00:43:16,972
<i>In Washington, Secretary</i>
<i>of State-Designate, Conrad Morgan...</i>

403
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:20,603
<i>... goes before his final Senate</i>
<i>subcommittee hearing this morning.</i>

404
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,547
<i>Morgan's approval by the committee</i>
<i>is virtually certain. At 41...</i>

405
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:58,843
- Good morning.
- Is Gordie Jones here?

406
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,283
All aboard!

407
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:28,937
Hey, Gordie!

408
00:44:29,014 --> 00:44:32,381
Hey, Sammy! How ya doin'?
Not much business today.

409
00:44:32,618 --> 00:44:35,610
- You doin' any?
- No, business isn't too good.

410
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:38,320
It's Maj. Booker, Gordie. John T. Booker.

411
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:42,319
I thought you were Sammy.
You look just like Sammy.

412
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:44,819
Has anyone been to see you recently?

413
00:44:44,897 --> 00:44:47,092
Has anyone asked you about
that last mission?

414
00:44:47,165 --> 00:44:49,895
What I wish we had is pelicans
instead of seagulls.

415
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:51,799
Who asked you about the last mission?

416
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,465
Just yesterday. A lady. Maybe today.
I told her about the pelicans.

417
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:57,038
How was the halibut?

418
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:05,914
Who the hell are you?

419
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:07,781
That's the lady, Major.

420
00:45:19,731 --> 00:45:20,857
<i>Where are we going?</i>

421
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:23,925
<i>Skiing. Maybe we can get to Mike Potter</i>
<i>before they do.</i>

422
00:45:24,002 --> 00:45:25,560
<i>But I've got a rental car.</i>

423
00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:27,571
<i>You're on an e</i>x<i>pense account.</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>

424
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:30,699
<i>- I don't have any ski clothes.</i>
<i>- We'll get something.</i>

425
00:45:45,323 --> 00:45:48,087
- Want some?
- No, thanks. Is it occupied?

426
00:45:48,493 --> 00:45:49,960
Go find out.

427
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,020
Go to the bathroom.

428
00:46:22,894 --> 00:46:24,759
No. 1 or No. 2?

429
00:46:24,896 --> 00:46:28,832
The window seat, last row,
left side as you go down the aisle.

430
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:31,895
An Oriental. See if you recognize him.

431
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:12,903
Looks like a waiter in a Chinese restaurant
I used to frequent in Des Moines.

432
00:47:12,977 --> 00:47:16,071
I'll bet Chinese food in Des Moines
is something to remember.

433
00:47:16,147 --> 00:47:18,775
- Is he following us?
- I'm not sure yet.

434
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:20,641
Maybe it's that waiter.

435
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:23,812
I don't think I tipped him
last time I was there.

436
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:27,516
Who did you talk to
at that cocktail party in Washington?

437
00:47:27,992 --> 00:47:31,894
Please don't ask. I'm almost certain I'll lie.

438
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:05,185
Make a call.

439
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:09,028
There's another one.

440
00:48:44,402 --> 00:48:46,029
So much for that.

441
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:13,592
When you're silent, you're silent.
What are you thinking about?

442
00:49:14,899 --> 00:49:16,230
Old friends.

443
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:18,797
Mhin.

444
00:49:20,038 --> 00:49:22,336
That guy on the plane was Mhin.

445
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:25,737
Maj. Mhin Van Thieu?

446
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:28,405
Another Black Tiger.

447
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,075
What don't you know?
What did you talk to him about?

448
00:49:34,018 --> 00:49:36,179
I never said a word to him in my life.

449
00:49:36,254 --> 00:49:40,452
- What about Murray Saunders?
- I don't know any Murray Saunders.

450
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:42,250
You were someone named Marilyn.

451
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:46,593
That Murray Saunders.

452
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:48,632
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing.

453
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:23,025
Good evening. You got here just in time.

454
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,592
- For what?
- The snow is melting fast.

455
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,729
Is Mike Potter in? He's on the ski patrol.

456
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:30,968
Mike? No, try his house. I'll dial it for you.

457
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:34,911
Do you want to take it over there?

458
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,663
- He's not in.
- Tomorrow's his day off. He's jump-crazy.

459
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,827
He'll be on the jump
first thing in the morning.

460
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:01,962
We better spend the night.

461
00:51:02,607 --> 00:51:04,438
- Do you have a room?
- I think so.

462
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:06,443
Do you want to fill this out?

463
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:20,924
To what extent
are we speaking to each other?

464
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:23,551
What do you want to talk about?

465
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,526
I was wondering, for instance...

466
00:51:25,596 --> 00:51:29,327
...if we're speaking enough
to share the only bed in the room.

467
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,493
Sure, we can share the bed.

468
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:50,948
Any enemies out there?

469
00:51:51,022 --> 00:51:53,456
I'm just as worried
about the enemy within.

470
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:57,353
- Are you an enemy, Margaret?
- No.

471
00:51:58,129 --> 00:52:01,223
You just happened to be there
when Gordie was killed today.

472
00:52:01,299 --> 00:52:04,200
- Were you there when Lou and Holly died?
- No.

473
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:10,264
Are you some kind of finger-man
for whoever's doing this?

474
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:18,312
Finger-person.

475
00:52:24,522 --> 00:52:26,615
John, I haven't lied to you.

476
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,255
Including last night?

477
00:52:30,194 --> 00:52:31,718
Especially last night.

478
00:52:33,097 --> 00:52:34,894
You fit in somewhere.

479
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:43,470
So do you.

480
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:47,970
<i>Mr. Morgan, I want to thank you</i>
<i>for the cooperation...</i>

481
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:50,980
<i>... you're affording this committee</i>
<i>by your appearance here.</i>

482
00:52:51,048 --> 00:52:52,447
<i>Thank you, Senator.</i>

483
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:55,680
<i>And I want to assure you</i>
<i>and the other members of the committee...</i>

484
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:59,746
<i>... that I fully understand the necessity</i>
<i>for hearings such as these.</i>

485
00:52:59,824 --> 00:53:03,590
<i>And I want you all to feel free</i>
<i>to probe into any areas at all...</i>

486
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:05,288
<i>... that might be of interest to you.</i>

487
00:53:05,363 --> 00:53:07,831
<i>I'm sure I can speak</i>
<i>for the entire committee...</i>

488
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:11,494
<i>... when I say, sir, that such an attitude</i>
<i>is deeply appreciated.</i>

489
00:53:11,636 --> 00:53:12,830
<i>Because we've had to deal...</i>

490
00:53:12,904 --> 00:53:15,168
- Think he'll make it?
- Morgan?

491
00:53:15,473 --> 00:53:17,498
- Yeah.
- Yes.

492
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:20,066
He's the new darling of Washington.

493
00:53:21,746 --> 00:53:25,204
<i>The attitude of the nation today is</i>
<i>far different from what it was...</i>

494
00:53:25,283 --> 00:53:27,444
<i>... in those early days before Vietnam.</i>

495
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:30,885
<i>I think the American public today</i>
<i>is far less eager...</i>

496
00:53:30,955 --> 00:53:32,855
We'd better get going.

497
00:54:08,325 --> 00:54:11,988
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>and welcome to Squaw Valley, USA.</i>

498
00:54:12,395 --> 00:54:16,525
<i>After being selected as the site</i>
<i>of the 1960 Winter Olympic Games...</i>

499
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,966
<i>... the Squaw Valley Comple</i>x
<i>was developed...</i>

500
00:54:19,035 --> 00:54:23,529
<i>... into one of the world's greatest ski areas</i>
<i>at a cost of over $25 million.</i>

501
00:54:24,374 --> 00:54:26,535
<i>You are now standing</i>
<i>in the lower terminal...</i>

502
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,704
<i>... of one of the world's most spectacular</i>
<i>aerial tramways.</i>

503
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,149
<i>The terminal alone cost</i>
<i>over $3.5 million in 1960 dollars.</i>

504
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:38,771
<i>What snow we had this year</i>
<i>is now melting rapidly.</i>

505
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:42,615
<i>So as we approach the top station,</i>
<i>we advise you to hurry out to the slopes...</i>

506
00:55:42,686 --> 00:55:44,551
<i>... and make the most of what's left.</i>

507
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,748
<i>On behalf of Squaw Valley, USA...</i>

508
00:55:46,823 --> 00:55:50,088
<i>... I'd like to thank you for joining us,</i>
<i>and have a happy day.</i>

509
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:45,479
- I'm looking for Mike Potter.
- You got him.

510
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:49,011
Major?

511
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:53,285
- What are you doing up here?
- Didn't you get my message?

512
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,120
You mean the Code Red?
I thought that was a gag.

513
00:56:56,192 --> 00:56:57,420
Mike, you're up.

514
00:56:58,028 --> 00:57:00,758
Let's go in the shack. We've gotta talk.

515
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:05,733
Meet me at the bottom.
Bring these with you.

516
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:07,730
Mike, wait.

517
00:57:26,623 --> 00:57:27,783
Oh, Jesus!

518
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,454
Jesus Christ, I thought I'd never find you.

519
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:22,191
There were cops
all over the place up there.

520
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:25,428
I've got your clothes.
You can change in the car.

521
01:00:25,602 --> 01:00:26,762
Are you all right?

522
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:31,538
- It was Mhin, wasn't it?
- The woman he met at the airport.

523
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:34,709
I'm sorry about Mike.

524
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:37,171
But you were right on the scene again.

525
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,979
I'm not the enemy, John.
I told you that last night.

526
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:45,182
- I think we better talk.
- Tell me!

527
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:52,985
Edgar Harolds.

528
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,295
- Childhood sweetheart?
- A drunk at a cocktail party.

529
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:59,927
- Who is he?
- Undersecretary of State.

530
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:03,336
A career man at the end of his career,
maybe the end of his rope.

531
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:05,306
Goddamn it, who are you?

532
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:10,441
Edgar Harolds worked for Conrad Morgan
during the Vietnam War and he hates him.

533
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:12,510
Morgan on the TV?

534
01:01:12,715 --> 01:01:16,879
The Senate does more than question a man
who's nominated for Secretary of State.

535
01:01:16,953 --> 01:01:19,854
Before Watergate,
it was generally a formality.

536
01:01:19,923 --> 01:01:24,860
Now, they do a pretty thorough job of it.
They even hire attorneys to investigate.

537
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:29,155
- What does that have to do with you?
- It's actually pretty funny.

538
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:33,031
I was invited to a cocktail party
by the head of the committee.

539
01:01:33,102 --> 01:01:36,560
Just a social event.
I had barely started to work for him.

540
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,698
You're a lawyer? An investigator?

541
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:40,901
I'd been standing for hours...

542
01:01:40,977 --> 01:01:43,775
...when I noticed this man
sitting all alone at a table.

543
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:47,873
He looked pleasantly drunk and harmless.
I went over and sat with him.

544
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:50,146
- Is Morgan mixed up in this?
- I don't know.

545
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,189
Harolds never mentioned him,
but it seems there's a connection.

546
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:55,518
The papers keep saying
his approval is assured.

547
01:01:55,592 --> 01:01:59,221
- How, if you told the committee...
- I never told the committee anything!

548
01:01:59,295 --> 01:02:00,853
You don't survive in Washington...

549
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:04,491
...by attacking men like Morgan
without substantial facts.

550
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:07,866
I just said I wanted to follow up
on some leads and they said, "Go."

551
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:09,802
- They know nothing about this?
- Not yet.

552
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:12,807
That's why we'll take the first plane east.

553
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,537
That may take days.
I have to get to Joe Walker in Mexico.

554
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:18,274
- He's the only man left.
- You're left.

555
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:21,010
And I want you to stay alive...

556
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:23,648
...for personal reasons.

557
01:02:25,255 --> 01:02:27,120
Do you believe me now?

558
01:02:35,864 --> 01:02:37,855
<i>Your attention, please:</i>

559
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:42,801
<i>Will all passengers holding tickets for</i>
<i>Intermountain Flight 184...</i>

560
01:02:43,004 --> 01:02:46,997
<i>... please contact the agent</i>
<i>at the Intermountain ticket counter.</i>

561
01:02:51,113 --> 01:02:54,446
Is there any space on 322
to San Francisco and Washington?

562
01:02:54,749 --> 01:02:56,808
Yes, ma'am. Round trip or one-way?

563
01:02:56,918 --> 01:02:58,647
- One way.
- Round trip.

564
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:01,713
You'll need it, back to LA.

565
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,619
You heard the man.

566
01:03:05,227 --> 01:03:07,661
Make mine one-way to LA. Next flight out.

567
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,532
<i>Final call:</i>

568
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:17,263
<i>Flight 2, now boarding at Gate No. 21.</i>

569
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:28,912
- How about a farewell cup of coffee?
- Why not?

570
01:03:28,984 --> 01:03:32,010
You better hurry.
They're beginning to board.

571
01:03:32,254 --> 01:03:33,915
Have a good flight.

572
01:04:02,117 --> 01:04:05,018
I'll do my damnedest
to get them to delay the confirmation...

573
01:04:05,086 --> 01:04:08,283
...but I'm gonna need you there to stop it,
if Harolds'll talk.

574
01:04:08,356 --> 01:04:10,449
I'll be there day after tomorrow.

575
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:14,552
<i>Flight 62, now boarding at Gate 21.</i>

576
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:16,094
That's me.

577
01:04:16,631 --> 01:04:19,657
- You gonna wave goodbye?
- I have to turn in the rental car.

578
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:22,703
Oh, God, I left one
with the meter running in San Diego!

579
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:26,764
The committee will love you.
They can ask for a bigger car rental budget.

580
01:04:26,841 --> 01:04:29,002
Don't worry about us taxpayers.

581
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:30,135
Bye.

582
01:05:22,264 --> 01:05:26,291
Collect call, please.
John T. Booker calling Murray Saunders.

583
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:26,650
<i>The emergency over the runway</i>
<i>is causing no danger to the terminal area.</i>

584
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:29,293
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

585
01:06:29,764 --> 01:06:32,927
<i>All persons in the terminal area</i>
<i>are asked to clear all gates...</i>

586
01:06:33,001 --> 01:06:35,697
<i>... and entrances to the field</i>
<i>so emergency workers...</i>

587
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,238
<i>...and equipment can get through.</i>
- Hold it!

588
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:41,537
<i>Obey the commands of the airport guards</i>
<i>and police officers...</i>

589
01:06:41,609 --> 01:06:45,841
<i>... so that rescue workers may perform</i>
<i>their duties as efficiently as possible.</i>

590
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:49,247
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>there is no danger to the terminal area.</i>

591
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:52,178
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

592
01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:29,922
What are you doing with that gun?

593
01:08:49,637 --> 01:08:50,865
Harolds!

594
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,508
Jesus Christ, I should have figured it out.

595
01:08:57,479 --> 01:08:58,741
In Paris.

596
01:09:01,983 --> 01:09:04,110
It was a setup all the way.

597
01:09:05,353 --> 01:09:08,447
That's what Harolds
was trying to tell Margaret.

598
01:09:12,227 --> 01:09:14,718
John, are you okay?

599
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:16,863
Yeah, thanks.

600
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:21,429
She wanted me to talk to him
and get the proof we need.

601
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:25,768
I think our next stop is Washington.
Are you sure you've got Walker covered?

602
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:29,899
I still can't figure out
why they suddenly decide to kill us all off.

603
01:09:29,978 --> 01:09:33,072
Maybe Morgan found out
that Harolds was about to crack.

604
01:09:33,147 --> 01:09:35,172
Why didn't he arrange an accident
for Harolds?

605
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:38,617
Five'll get you ten
there's a damn good reason he didn't.

606
01:09:38,686 --> 01:09:40,313
Let's go ask him.

607
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,797
Morning.

608
01:09:55,303 --> 01:09:58,966
- May I help you gentlemen?
- Yes, Mr. Harolds' apartment, please.

609
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,441
- May I have your name?
- We want to surprise him.

610
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,877
I'm afraid we're not allowed
to surprise our tenants.

611
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:11,145
Even if you were J. Edgar Hoover himself,
I couldn't allow you upstairs.

612
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:14,052
It's not likely he could be Mr. Hoover
if he wanted to.

613
01:10:14,122 --> 01:10:17,580
Not only is he the wrong color,
but Mr. Hoover is dead.

614
01:10:18,059 --> 01:10:19,822
I'm sure you get my meaning.

615
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:21,785
Yes, we do.

616
01:10:22,163 --> 01:10:24,859
We want to make sure
you get what we mean.

617
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:27,629
You see, my friend here is very cranky.

618
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:30,704
In fact,
I'd say he's on the very edge of anger.

619
01:10:31,172 --> 01:10:35,734
And in about five seconds,
I'm going to ask him to kick your teeth in...

620
01:10:35,843 --> 01:10:39,438
...if you don't show us the way
to Mr. Harolds' apartment.

621
01:10:43,484 --> 01:10:46,521
Very well. Follow me.

622
01:10:47,889 --> 01:10:49,186
He must have good teeth.

623
01:10:58,232 --> 01:10:59,722
Remember what happened...

624
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,759
...the last time a Washington apartment
was broken into for political reasons.

625
01:11:03,838 --> 01:11:06,398
Think about it.
It altered the course of history.

626
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:08,601
He will alter the course of your nose...

627
01:11:08,676 --> 01:11:10,871
...if you don't show us
where the apartment is.

628
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:14,244
- lf you put it in that perspective...
- Now!

629
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,319
There it is.

630
01:11:20,588 --> 01:11:24,615
- Should we ring the buzzer or kick it in?
- No, I'll ring the bell.

631
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:32,223
Yes?

632
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:35,661
- Tell him it's you.
- It's me, Mr. Harolds.

633
01:11:36,938 --> 01:11:37,996
Who?

634
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,104
Louder. Be more specific.

635
01:11:40,308 --> 01:11:43,505
Albert, the doorman.

636
01:11:44,812 --> 01:11:46,211
What do you want?

637
01:11:46,347 --> 01:11:49,316
- Package.
- I've got a package.

638
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:03,662
- It's all right, Albert.
- Thank you. You've been quite civilized.

639
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:09,059
Good morning, Mr. Harolds.

640
01:12:09,136 --> 01:12:12,435
"My vengeance is swift, saith the Lord."

641
01:12:12,607 --> 01:12:16,441
I expected it to be swift and very violent.

642
01:12:17,878 --> 01:12:20,005
I haven't been disappointed.

643
01:12:21,048 --> 01:12:24,745
Since the day you walked out of
that hotel room in Paris...

644
01:12:24,986 --> 01:12:28,285
...l've been wondering
if I might not see you again.

645
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:33,516
The fact that you are here now
is testimony to your powers of survival.

646
01:12:34,228 --> 01:12:36,423
The test is not over yet.

647
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,725
I'd like you to meet John Booker.

648
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:42,528
Maj. Booker,
the shepherd of the betrayed flock.

649
01:12:42,737 --> 01:12:45,331
That's what we're here to talk about.

650
01:12:45,506 --> 01:12:49,875
Normally, I'd do what I've done
all the years I've served my country...

651
01:12:50,144 --> 01:12:52,442
...and feed you a line of shit.

652
01:12:53,948 --> 01:12:56,178
But I don't think I'll bother.

653
01:12:56,751 --> 01:12:59,151
Perhaps you're doing me a favor.

654
01:13:01,022 --> 01:13:03,547
No, Major, there's no one else here.

655
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,697
My wife and children had the good sense
to go on about their own lives years ago.

656
01:13:11,499 --> 01:13:15,299
- Do you have a family, Major?
- I had plans, but they didn't work out.

657
01:13:19,173 --> 01:13:21,437
Then perhaps you're fortunate.

658
01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:26,443
So this is what I get...

659
01:13:27,248 --> 01:13:31,742
...for having too much to drink
and finding a receptive ear.

660
01:13:33,254 --> 01:13:37,088
Can you imagine a career diplomat
getting drunk and babbling...

661
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:39,592
...at a Washington cocktail party?

662
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:45,061
You don't get to be an old-timer here
without learning not to do that...

663
01:13:45,766 --> 01:13:47,893
...unless you're over the hill.

664
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:53,103
An interesting phrase, "over the hill."

665
01:13:53,841 --> 01:13:58,175
Conrad has been telling me for years,
that's where I am.

666
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:01,439
He's a brilliant man, Conrad.

667
01:14:02,349 --> 01:14:05,716
Most of us think we know
what we want out of life.

668
01:14:06,554 --> 01:14:11,082
But Conrad is one of those few
who knows how to get it.

669
01:14:11,826 --> 01:14:15,762
Of course, he learned immediately
of my drunken indiscretion.

670
01:14:16,464 --> 01:14:21,265
The captured indiscreet remark
is a source of power in Washington...

671
01:14:21,335 --> 01:14:23,667
...a lesson Conrad learned well.

672
01:14:25,906 --> 01:14:29,103
I may have been the one
who first taught him that.

673
01:14:29,577 --> 01:14:32,239
Perhaps I am over the hill.

674
01:14:33,981 --> 01:14:38,008
And she is a brilliant young woman,
quite lovely.

675
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:44,121
There was something about her.
I just wanted to talk to her.

676
01:14:44,892 --> 01:14:47,952
But, of course,
you must know that by now, Major.

677
01:14:48,963 --> 01:14:52,490
Your being the leader of the Black Tigers...

678
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,860
...I assume she must have gone
directly to you.

679
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:58,700
Of course,
Morgan assumed the same thing.

680
01:14:59,106 --> 01:15:02,906
His efforts to find out
just how much you knew...

681
01:15:02,977 --> 01:15:06,777
...and whom you might have told
have probably kept you alive.

682
01:15:07,348 --> 01:15:10,340
Four of the men who came back with me
weren't as lucky.

683
01:15:12,653 --> 01:15:15,850
My condolences, of course,
will seem meaningless.

684
01:15:17,424 --> 01:15:19,756
I was there in the beginning...

685
01:15:20,427 --> 01:15:23,863
...when they invented
the Phoenix Operation.

686
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:27,867
Do you know what everyone
was most upset about?

687
01:15:28,369 --> 01:15:33,033
Not the idea that we were
consciously structuring a group of men...

688
01:15:33,107 --> 01:15:36,907
...whose purpose was
the clandestine murder of other men.

689
01:15:38,512 --> 01:15:43,074
Not the moral ramifications
that might befall us in another life...

690
01:15:43,884 --> 01:15:47,479
...for the decision
based on political expediency.

691
01:15:49,223 --> 01:15:53,250
What we got most embroiled in
was an argument over what...

692
01:15:53,327 --> 01:15:55,887
...a particular group of assassins...

693
01:15:55,963 --> 01:15:59,126
...we decided to call the Black Tigers...

694
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,226
...what that group of assassins
would wear...

695
01:16:02,336 --> 01:16:07,035
...when they went out to relieve
selected individuals of their very lives.

696
01:16:08,008 --> 01:16:12,035
Finally, after a great deal
of bitter argument...

697
01:16:12,613 --> 01:16:17,209
...we determined
to dress the Black Tigers in all black.

698
01:16:18,018 --> 01:16:22,512
The commission was then paid to
a noted designer who shall be nameless...

699
01:16:22,957 --> 01:16:27,951
...who designed the black clothing
the Black Tigers wore as they rolled out...

700
01:16:28,028 --> 01:16:30,189
<i>... on their holy crusades.</i>

701
01:16:30,531 --> 01:16:32,658
<i>You made quite a reputation</i>
<i>for yourselves.</i>

702
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:39,098
Mr. Morgan?
Mr. Harolds has some visitors.

703
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:41,972
No, sir, I'm not sure.

704
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:46,240
I think one of them is Murray Saunders
from the Los Angeles office.

705
01:16:47,548 --> 01:16:49,345
You want them stopped?

706
01:16:50,184 --> 01:16:52,812
Right, and a man on Harolds.
You've got it.

707
01:16:57,091 --> 01:16:58,115
We were set up.

708
01:16:59,126 --> 01:17:00,354
Yes.

709
01:17:00,694 --> 01:17:02,355
What was the deal?

710
01:17:02,696 --> 01:17:07,224
When I was a younger man, I knew
I was going to be Secretary of State...

711
01:17:07,301 --> 01:17:09,496
...or perhaps even President.

712
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:12,603
If I tell you the answer to that question...

713
01:17:13,807 --> 01:17:18,767
...I may not even be afforded
the opportunity to retire next year...

714
01:17:18,846 --> 01:17:21,906
...with the modicum of dignity left to me.

715
01:17:26,387 --> 01:17:28,355
But then, I suppose your life...

716
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:31,789
...is not nearly so inconsequential to you...

717
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:34,054
...as it is to Mr. Morgan...

718
01:17:34,628 --> 01:17:36,596
...or even to me.

719
01:17:43,704 --> 01:17:47,606
- I hope this letter's the answer.
- It's the best shot we've got.

720
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:16,258
Okay, Saunders, I want that letter.

721
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,045
Listen, Al.

722
01:18:28,315 --> 01:18:31,580
Somebody got into that computer
and this letter proves it.

723
01:18:32,519 --> 01:18:34,180
The letter, Murray.

724
01:18:36,623 --> 01:18:38,648
Come on.

725
01:18:44,631 --> 01:18:47,532
- Get the letter. I'll cover you.
- Watch out!

726
01:19:26,707 --> 01:19:29,175
- Enjoy the fight?
- Terrific.

727
01:20:18,859 --> 01:20:20,258
Here it is.

728
01:20:21,428 --> 01:20:23,692
Why would this guy live
halfway to Baltimore?

729
01:20:23,764 --> 01:20:27,325
Who knows? Maybe it has
something to do with Spiro Agnew.

730
01:20:27,401 --> 01:20:30,234
It wasn't very hard
to get an appointment with the big man.

731
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:33,569
Morgan's very interested
in what he thinks we might have to sell.

732
01:20:44,284 --> 01:20:47,310
- Good morning, Saunders.
- Good morning, Morgan.

733
01:20:47,387 --> 01:20:49,355
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

734
01:20:49,423 --> 01:20:52,654
A gentleman whom I'm sure
will add to our discussion.

735
01:20:53,093 --> 01:20:54,253
I see.

736
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,124
John T. Booker.

737
01:21:06,273 --> 01:21:11,108
Saunders, I trust this rather unusual
meeting is as important as you indicated.

738
01:21:11,445 --> 01:21:14,846
Something you said had to do with
our last rather unusual meeting...

739
01:21:14,915 --> 01:21:16,610
...in that Paris hotel room.

740
01:21:16,683 --> 01:21:20,141
Something, yes.
But with one notable addition.

741
01:21:21,822 --> 01:21:23,585
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

742
01:21:23,657 --> 01:21:27,149
Can we get on with it?
I have a rather busy day ahead of me.

743
01:21:27,227 --> 01:21:31,323
You made a deal in Paris with Kuong Yen,
the North Vietnamese negotiator.

744
01:21:31,398 --> 01:21:33,559
Secret deals are the heart of diplomacy.

745
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:36,367
This deal called for
the murder of the Black Tigers.

746
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,628
Murder, Mr. Booker?

747
01:21:39,406 --> 01:21:42,534
One other American knows about it
and he talked.

748
01:21:43,944 --> 01:21:45,138
Indeed?

749
01:21:45,245 --> 01:21:47,076
At first, I couldn't figure out...

750
01:21:47,147 --> 01:21:50,241
...why you didn't try to kill Harolds
along with the rest of us.

751
01:21:50,317 --> 01:21:51,682
He told me.

752
01:21:52,152 --> 01:21:56,282
He sent a registered letter to four lawyers,
none of whom you know.

753
01:21:57,024 --> 01:22:01,222
The letters were to be opened
in the event of his untimely death.

754
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:03,660
Early Agatha Christie.

755
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:05,288
And just as effective.

756
01:22:05,365 --> 01:22:09,597
The letters explain what was known by you
and Kuong Yen as the Phoenix Solution.

757
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:13,538
I couldn't figure out what Maj. Mhin
was doing popping in and out of my life.

758
01:22:13,607 --> 01:22:16,906
At first, I assumed he worked for them,
whoever "they" were.

759
01:22:16,977 --> 01:22:21,505
But of course, "they" are you,
and you are all one.

760
01:22:21,748 --> 01:22:25,775
I see. "We have met the enemy
and they is us."

761
01:22:25,853 --> 01:22:27,753
Comic strip philosophy, Mr. Booker.

762
01:22:27,821 --> 01:22:30,654
Agreed, and now Kuong Yen
is manipulating you...

763
01:22:30,724 --> 01:22:33,284
...like the comic strip diplomat you are.

764
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:37,328
He waited patiently until the moment
of your greatest vulnerability...

765
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:40,829
...the eve of your confirmation
as Secretary of State.

766
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:42,693
Now he's blackmailing you...

767
01:22:42,769 --> 01:22:45,829
...into completing the deal
you never finished...

768
01:22:46,506 --> 01:22:49,134
...the extermination of the Black Tigers.

769
01:22:49,643 --> 01:22:52,635
They are very unforgiving people.

770
01:22:52,779 --> 01:22:54,508
Toward you or the Black Tigers?

771
01:22:54,581 --> 01:22:58,847
- Toward us, Mr. Booker. "We" is us.
- Perhaps.

772
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:12,159
Interesting document.

773
01:23:17,304 --> 01:23:20,603
Morgan, you're gonna pick up that phone
and call the White House.

774
01:23:20,674 --> 01:23:23,040
Sudden personal problems
are going to prevent you...

775
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:26,568
...from accepting the nomination
as Secretary of State.

776
01:23:27,414 --> 01:23:30,474
If you don't,
the news media is going to have...

777
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,780
...one hell of a time with that letter.

778
01:23:33,553 --> 01:23:37,546
I understand, Maj. Booker,
that you were quite a jungle fighter.

779
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:39,692
This is my kind of jungle, Major.

780
01:23:42,596 --> 01:23:46,726
No, I just don't think it would be...

781
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,030
...expedient for me to resign at this time.

782
01:23:49,102 --> 01:23:50,433
Expedient?

783
01:23:50,637 --> 01:23:53,868
Just like it was expedient
to send us on that POW raid?

784
01:23:54,675 --> 01:23:57,576
Expedience built this country, Maj. Booker.

785
01:23:58,312 --> 01:24:03,272
It was expedient for this great democracy
to have legal slavery for half its existence.

786
01:24:04,051 --> 01:24:08,112
And it was expedient to keep the vote
from women for 150 years.

787
01:24:08,388 --> 01:24:12,484
Expedient to declare war on Spain
and Mexico and to invade Cambodia.

788
01:24:13,126 --> 01:24:16,857
From the halls of Montezuma,
Maj. Booker, to the shores of Tripoli...

789
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:20,366
And it was expedient, goddamn it,
to get rid of the Black Tigers.

790
01:24:21,668 --> 01:24:24,034
The end still justifies the means.

791
01:24:24,104 --> 01:24:25,833
I don't buy that.

792
01:24:26,573 --> 01:24:30,475
It occurs to me that most of those
who follow your logic end up in places...

793
01:24:30,544 --> 01:24:32,569
...like Elba and San Clemente.

794
01:24:32,713 --> 01:24:33,805
Come now...

795
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,507
Check your history.

796
01:24:35,582 --> 01:24:38,710
Most of our expedient wars
ended up in failure.

797
01:24:38,852 --> 01:24:41,878
Our successes didn't just happen
because they were expedient.

798
01:24:41,955 --> 01:24:44,856
Those Americans you spoke of
gave up their lives willingly.

799
01:24:44,925 --> 01:24:46,984
Does that really make such a difference?

800
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,961
It makes all the goddamn difference.

801
01:24:51,398 --> 01:24:55,357
People like you never could see that
and maybe they never will.

802
01:24:57,371 --> 01:25:00,932
It's not that you don't deserve
to be Secretary of State.

803
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:04,034
You don't deserve to live.

804
01:25:05,412 --> 01:25:08,040
That's an interesting philosophy, but...

805
01:25:08,115 --> 01:25:11,983
But philosophy is bullshit, right, Morgan?

806
01:25:14,254 --> 01:25:16,017
That letter isn't.

807
01:25:17,824 --> 01:25:19,485
I tell you what.

808
01:25:20,227 --> 01:25:24,095
You take this letter over to
the <i>Washington Post</i> with my best regards.

809
01:25:24,164 --> 01:25:27,827
But tell them they're gonna have
a hard time verifying that with Harolds...

810
01:25:27,901 --> 01:25:32,634
...because visitors are not allowed
in the Bethesda Hospital psychiatric ward.

811
01:25:36,276 --> 01:25:39,109
Yes, it was a shame.

812
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:41,409
They found him crawling on the floor...

813
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:44,473
...and howling like a banshee.

814
01:25:45,285 --> 01:25:49,381
Took four men just to put him
into the straitjacket.

815
01:25:49,923 --> 01:25:54,155
Nervous disorder, they called it,
but actually, he's quite mad.

816
01:25:54,294 --> 01:25:57,695
Hello? I'd like to check on
the condition of a...

817
01:25:57,764 --> 01:25:59,925
...Mr. Harolds, Edgar J.

818
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,971
Thank you.

819
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:16,048
A letter written by a madman is...

820
01:26:16,116 --> 01:26:19,244
...hardly what they call prime evidence.

821
01:26:19,386 --> 01:26:20,853
Is it, Mr. Booker?

822
01:26:22,422 --> 01:26:25,084
As I told you,
I have a rather busy day ahead of me.

823
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:29,219
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm sure you can find your own way out.

824
01:26:34,134 --> 01:26:36,227
By the way, Mr. Booker.

825
01:26:37,137 --> 01:26:40,766
Tragic news about your lady friend.
Margaret, was it?

826
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:44,837
All that information she had
must have been irreplaceable.

827
01:26:45,145 --> 01:26:46,134
Tragic.

828
01:26:46,213 --> 01:26:47,544
You bastard!

829
01:27:14,774 --> 01:27:16,264
Wait a minute.

830
01:27:25,986 --> 01:27:28,546
Accelerator pedal working all right today?

831
01:27:35,328 --> 01:27:36,886
Work for Morgan?

832
01:27:38,398 --> 01:27:39,592
Do you?

833
01:27:59,084 --> 01:28:01,712
<i>We're running a little late, Franklin.</i>

834
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:16,790
<i>Secretary of State Morgan will become</i>
<i>one of the youngest men ever...</i>

835
01:28:16,868 --> 01:28:18,631
<i>... to achieve this high office.</i>

836
01:28:18,703 --> 01:28:22,230
<i>He's described as one of the new breed</i>
<i>of diplomats for the '70s.</i>

837
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:25,466
<i>Although still in his early 40s...</i>

838
01:28:25,543 --> 01:28:28,478
<i>... Morgan has had</i>
<i>a long and distinguished career...</i>

839
01:28:28,546 --> 01:28:30,980
<i>... as one of America's leading diplomats.</i>

840
01:28:31,049 --> 01:28:33,882
<i>His skill at top-level negotiations</i>
<i>has made him...</i>

841
01:28:33,952 --> 01:28:36,944
<i>... one of the few</i>
<i>State Department leaders to...</i>

842
01:29:02,781 --> 01:29:04,976
<i>Franklin, where are we going?</i>

843
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,275
<i>I said, "Where are we going?"</i>

844
01:29:10,955 --> 01:29:12,752
What the hell is this?

845
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:15,418
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

846
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:18,055
Booker.

847
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:21,058
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

848
01:29:21,132 --> 01:29:25,364
You said I was a good jungle fighter.
I'm also a fast learner.

849
01:29:42,387 --> 01:29:45,220
All right, now, you stop this car, you fool.

850
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:48,020
Relax, Morgan, we're just going to talk.

851
01:29:50,695 --> 01:29:53,027
All right, go ahead. Talk!

852
01:29:53,865 --> 01:29:57,266
What you said about expedience
made a hell of a lot of sense.

853
01:29:57,502 --> 01:30:02,337
I see there's only one way to deal with
people like you: expediently.

854
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:06,775
You won all the battles, Morgan,
but you're gonna lose this war.

855
01:30:07,078 --> 01:30:08,807
How would you like to be an MIA?

856
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,804
What're you talking about?

857
01:30:10,882 --> 01:30:15,319
When it comes time for your swearing in
today, you're not gonna be there.

858
01:30:16,354 --> 01:30:17,844
I'll be there.

859
01:30:18,523 --> 01:30:19,717
You're dreaming.

860
01:30:20,024 --> 01:30:21,013
Am I?

861
01:30:30,502 --> 01:30:33,562
Booker, they're going to come
looking for me.

862
01:30:33,972 --> 01:30:38,841
You can't just disappear a Secretary
of State without arousing someone's ire.

863
01:30:39,377 --> 01:30:40,469
Let 'em look.

864
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:43,746
All right. Tell me, what's your plan?

865
01:30:44,015 --> 01:30:45,880
If you get away with this...

866
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:49,977
...it'll betray every guy that ever died
in any war we ever had.

867
01:30:50,054 --> 01:30:54,013
And God knows how many more people
you'll kill in the future.

868
01:30:54,526 --> 01:30:56,653
I'm not gonna let it happen.

869
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:59,892
You're insane. It won't work.

870
01:31:00,064 --> 01:31:01,588
You can bet your ass it will.

871
01:31:01,966 --> 01:31:04,059
Crazy, goddamn idiot!

872
01:31:04,335 --> 01:31:06,633
You stop this car! You hear me?

873
01:31:07,138 --> 01:31:10,232
Stop this car or I'll kill you!

874
01:31:10,808 --> 01:31:12,241
You're panicking.

875
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:13,800
Stop the goddamn car!

876
01:32:34,826 --> 01:32:37,056
