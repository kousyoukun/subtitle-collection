8
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,583

00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:53,711
<i>¶ That you're
no good for me ¶</i>

10

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,151
<i>¶ It's black
And it's white ¶</i>

16
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,087

17

18

Are you alert?

19
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:13,510
Okay, well tell them...

20
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:16,347
<i>¶ But you don't really
Want to go ¶</i>

21
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:18,116
No.

24
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:25,607
I'll be there in about
15 minutes, so stop arguing.

25
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:28,476
Okay, thanks. Bye.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,000
<i>¶ We used to be ¶</i>

27

<i>¶ Just like twins
So in synch ¶</i>

28
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:38,472
- Morning, Freddy.
- Morning, Abby.

29
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,775
- You look awfully pretty today.
- Oh, is it that bad in there?

30
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,911
- Good morning. We got problems.
- Morning.

31
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:46,047
There are no problems, Joy,
only solutions.

32
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,281
The traffic camera is down

33
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:49,783
and we have no B-roll
for our traffic segment.

34
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,086
- That is a problem.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,187
Call Matt at Media Lab.

36
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:53,788
He's got some Skycams
and he owes me.

37
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,692
- Where are all my weathermen?
- Right here.

38
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:57,026
- Hey.
- Hello.

39
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:59,395
Thank you all for coming.
You guys look great.

40
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:01,131
Thanks for being here. Good.

41
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:03,166
Is there a reason
they're all overweight?

42
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,535
If they get
the forecast wrong,

43
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,236
research shows people
are more willing

44
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:07,271
to forgive a fat guy.

45
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:08,606
Abby, I hate to do this to you,

46
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,741
but I don't think that
I can work with her anymore.

47
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:12,944
It's bad enough I have
to take her criticism at home.

48
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:14,279
I'm not gonna
do it on the air.

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,582
- A man can only endure so much.
- Larry, you are not a man,

50
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,452
you are a newsman.

51
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,687
And newsmen are not defined
by the easy times,

52
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,990
they're defined
by the hard times.

53
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,659
Can you imagine
Ted Koppel or Tom Brokaw

54
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,194
working with their
wives as co-anchors? No.

55
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:30,964
Because they
couldn't handle it.

56
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:33,567
But you.
You, my friend,

57
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,169
have balls the size
of Volkswagens.

58
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,738
Don't think
I haven't noticed.

59
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,773
I only thought of them
as blue of late.

60
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,876
But you're right.
They're quite sizeable.

61
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:42,311
But not disproportionately
so,

62
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,579
I like to think of them
as aesthetically pleasing.

63
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,281
Yeah, I think
I made my point.

64
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,684
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Josh, nobody in Sacramento

65
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:50,352
gives a crap about
the extinction rate

66
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:52,455
of the Brazilian slug worm.
It's not newsworthy.

67
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:54,724
All right. But knowing which
celebutante is in rehab

68
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:55,825
is of vital importance?

69
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,594
You know, the sound
of your voice makes...

70
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,096
Okay. He is trying to kill me.

71
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:01,064
- He knows I can't eat crab.
- It's Crab Rangoon.

72
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,932
Who doesn't eat Crab Rangoon?

73
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,503
Oh, my God. Does anybody
see this? Is that a hive?

74
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:07,004
Looks like syphilis to me.

75
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,357
You wouldn't know
what syphilis looks like

76
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:11,727
if it weren't for my story
on hot celebrity STDs.

77
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:16,282
<i>- Stand by to go to three.
- Yeah, so some...</i>

78
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,467
<i>Cacciatore gets mushrooms,
garlic. Exactly.</i>

79
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:20,570
- Yeah. Put the mushrooms in.
- All right.

80
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:22,638
And whatever amount
of garlic you want.

81
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,807
- Really?
- Can't have enough garlic.

82
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:26,041
You can.

83
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,861
I certainly can.
Do it every night.

84
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:29,446
<i>I got a nice,
big spoon for you.</i>

85
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:31,081
<i>Excellent. Thanks.</i>

86
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:33,551
- Here you go.
- Mm.

87
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:35,387
- Mm!
- That good?

88
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:36,755
I have to say, Rocco,

89
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:39,057
this is the best chicken
cacciatore I've ever tasted.

90
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:42,177
I knew you'd like it.
It's duck cacciatore, actually.

91
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:44,313
- Oh, no.
- Did he just say "duck"?

92
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:46,782
And it's a great
alternative to chicken.

93
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:48,986
It kind of tastes
just like chicken, right?

94
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:51,154
- Mm-hm.
- Duck, like "quack, quack" duck?

95
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,140
Get ready to an early break.
Yeah.

96
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,057
- Whoa, duck.
- Yeah.

97
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:55,526
Man, we're a
chicken household.

98
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,362
We really are.

99
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,863
Tell Larry to throw it to Javier
while she pulls it together.

100
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,182
<i>Or is it okay?</i>

101
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:04,035
<i>It's good.
Javier, do you like it?</i>

102
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,636
Mm.

103
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:07,790
Can I take home
the leftovers?

104
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,757
You sure you don't want
any leftovers?

105
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:11,845
When we return,

106
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:13,629
<i>- our Skycam traffic update.
- Okay.</i>

107
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,565
<i>And guess who's
in rehab this week.</i>

108
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:18,100
<i>Stand by to roll break.
Also, how you too can adopt</i>

109
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,403
<i>your very own slug worm,
when we come back.</i>

110
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:21,755
Roll your break.

111
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,657
<i>How about salt?
Salt make it better?</i>

112
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:28,195
I don't know how you do it.

113
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:30,364
It's just a matter of looking
chaos right in the eye

114
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:32,100
and telling it to eff off.

115
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:34,120
You guys did great.
Thank you.

116
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,405
I think it's time for a new chef
on this show. I do.

117
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:38,206
Now, come on.
Rocco's been with us...

118
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,043
- Abby?
- It's this upsetting?

119
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:42,178
Hey, Stuart wants to see you.
He's freaking out.

120
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:45,849
Oh, he got the ratings.

121
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,769
<i>- Want some?
- Yeah, give me that.</i>

122
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:56,009
Have you seen the ratings
from yesterday?

123
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,112
We got beat by all
the network shows,

124
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,914
<i>including a rerun of
Who's the Boss?</i>

125
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:01,849
The one where
the vacuum breaks.

126
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,585
It's just a temporary setback,
Stuart.

127
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:05,187
Things will be better
tomorrow.

128
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:08,124
You know that guy
with the cable-access show

129
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,660
on Channel 83 does better.

130
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:13,029
<i>If we program
Jerry Springer reruns,</i>

131
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,016
we'd do a nine-share
at a quarter of the price.

132
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,016
Please don't tell me

133
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,785
you're thinking
of killing the show.

134
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,322
We're not a family-run station
anymore, Abby.

135
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:24,191
I mean, I love you.
You're great at what you do.

136
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,844
But you gotta
get me some numbers.

137
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:28,830
I got two daughters in college
and a son in beauty school.

138
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:31,400
I don't know how much
you know about Vidal Sassoon,

139
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:32,769
but that shit ain't cheap.

140
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:36,723
I can rally. I will rally.

141
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:39,609
You do rally.
Every day, Abby.

142
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,477
But that's
what worries me.

143
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:43,397
That even you
won't be enough.

144
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:46,117
I should not be letting
corporate management

145
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:48,686
dictate the content
of this show. It's my show.

146
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:52,357
I control it.
I should skip the date tonight.

147
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,459
Stay home,
think up some ideas for sweeps.

148
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,361
Absolutely not, Abby.

149
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:58,997
You should be out there
observing humanity.

150
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:01,200
Humanity is who watches
our show.

151
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:03,035
Yeah.
All 2.47 percent of them.

152
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:06,173
You have rescheduled
on this guy three times.

153
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:08,242
You cancel on him tonight
and he's gone.

154
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,144
Look at this bone structure.

155
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:13,013
This could be the bone structure
of your future children.

156
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:14,814
Don't you want them
to be symmetrical?

157
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:16,618
You printed out his profile?

158
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,253
What? These have
not been touched

159
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,621
in quite some time.

160
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:21,890
I have to live vicariously
through your dating life.

161
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,860
And I really think that this
could be our next boyfriend.

162
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,480
- Hi.
- Hello.

163
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,316
I'm looking for a guy
with sandy brown hair,

164
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,484
athletic build, blue eyes.
He's 5'9".

165
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,387
Which I know you're thinking
is a little short,

166
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:36,055
<i>but he's read
The Great Gatsby twice...</i>

167
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:37,690
Well, technically
I'm 5'8" and a half,

168
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:39,860
<i>but I could read
The Great Gatsby</i>

169
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,928
again if it makes
it any better.

170
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:45,767
Hi. Can I get some water
for the table?

171
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:47,535
Uh, yeah, a bottle
of flat water, please?

172
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:48,770
- Sure.
- Thank you.

173
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,538
Um, just one second.
I'm sorry.

174
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,174
Did you know they've done
studies that show

175
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,895
tap water and bottled water
are basically the same thing.

176
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:58,064
And they recently passed
a law where restaurants

177
00:06:58,065 --> 00:07:00,599
have to filter their tap water,
so it's not really tap water,

178
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,336
it's filtered water,
which is the same

179
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:04,538
except you don't have to pay
$7 for it. Right?

180
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,890
I like the way
it tastes better anyway.

181
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,410
Can I get a Scotch on the rocks,
please? Thank you.

182
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,060
Oh, yeah.

183
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:14,082
Huh. I thought, uh...

184
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,618
I thought in your profile
it said you, uh...

185
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:18,186
You like to drink red wine.

186
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,308
You printed out my profile?

187
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,959
Actually,
my associate producer did.

188
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,928
She doesn't like me
to not be prepared.

189
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:28,497
Not that I'm ever not prepared.
Kudos, by the way,

190
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,517
on your comprehensive
car insurance plan.

191
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,236
That wasn't in my profile.

192
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,654
No, but it's in your
background check.

193
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,025
So, ahem,
tell me about yourself.

194
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:39,393
Well, what's
left to talk about

195
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:40,945
that you don't already know,
right?

196
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:43,581
Ah. Good point.
Ha-ha.

197
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,752
All right,
well, you know,

198
00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:50,055
I actually took the liberty
of printing out

199
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:53,093
some talking points
in case this happened.

200
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:55,045
I take it this
has happened before?

201
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,397
No. No. But you have
nine out of 10

202
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,767
of the necessary attributes
on my checklist.

203
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:02,019
Oh, dear God. Okay.

204
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,306
Oh, this is a good one.
Let's start with three, okay?

205
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,528
Don't ask.

206
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,025
<i>More on this story
when we come back.</i>

207
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:39,345
<i>We'll hear from a zoo official
now forced to take...</i>

208
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:41,347
<i>And we're back with
The Ugly Truth,</i>

209
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:43,131
<i>where tonight
we're gonna be talking about</i>

210
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:47,186
<i>what it is men and women
really want in relationships.</i>

211
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:48,938
I've been looking through
some books.

212
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:52,192
<i>Smart Women,
Foolish Choices. Ehh!</i>

213
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:55,630
<i>Men Who Love Women
Who Hate Them. Ehh!</i>

214
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:58,149
<i>And Women Hating Men
Who Loved Women</i>

215
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,869
<i>Who Hate Loving Men. Huh?</i>

216
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,342
<i>Billions and billions wasted
on psychobabble bullshit.</i>

217
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:08,894
Now, listen up, ladies, because
I'm only gonna say this once

218
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:12,098
and it is just
three little words.

219
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,502
Men are simple.

220
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:17,704
We cannot be trained.

221
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:21,141
All this
"Men are from Venus" crap

222
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:23,978
<i>is a waste of your time
and money.</i>

223
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:26,580
<i>You wanna be a lonely hag,
then that's fine,</i>

224
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,381
<i>keep reading
these stupid books.</i>

225
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:32,738
<i>But you want a relationship,
then here's how you get one:</i>

226
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,823
It's called a Stairmaster.

227
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,175
Get on it, and get skinny,

228
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,911
<i>and get some trashy lingerie
while you're at it,</i>

229
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,230
because at the end of the day,

230
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:43,115
all we're interested
in is looks.

231
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,083
And no one falls in love
with your personality

232
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,587
at first sight.

233
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:49,523
We fall in love
with your tits and your ass,

234
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:51,726
and we stick around because
of what you're willing

235
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:53,494
to do with them.

236
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:56,664
So you wanna win a man over,
you don't need 10 steps,

237
00:09:56,665 --> 00:10:00,234
you need one,
and it's called a blowjob.

238
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:02,136
And don't forget to...

239
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,712
<i>Okay? Now, let's
take the first caller.</i>

240
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,247
<i>How dare you burn those books.</i>

241
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,565
<i>They've helped my personal life
more than I can say.</i>

242
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:15,102
<i>What's your boyfriend's name,
princess?</i>

243
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:17,320
<i>Well,
I'm not seeing anyone right now.</i>

244
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:20,124
My point exactly, Shrek.
Next caller.

245
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,725
<i>You're on the air.</i>

246
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:25,764
So you're saying that men
are incapable of love?

247
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,283
<i>Oh, did I burst your little
harlequin romance bubble?</i>

248
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:29,551
<i>What? Come on.</i>

249
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:32,255
The only thing you burst
is your credibility.

250
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,141
Men are completely capable
of experiencing love.

251
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:37,277
Okay, I'll bite.
Go on. Who's the guy?

252
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,479
<i>- What?
- The guy. Mr. Wonderful.</i>

253
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,281
The one who's
so capable of love.

254
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:43,117
Who is he? What's he like?

255
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:46,871
He's smart, he's handsome
but he doesn't know it.

256
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:51,126
He's successful, but in a job
that means something.

257
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,962
He loves red wine, picnics,
classical music.

258
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:57,749
<i>Mm, this is a guy
in America, right?</i>

259
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,586
I mean, you're not calling
from Europe or something?

260
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:02,772
He loves dogs,
but he's more of a cat person.

261
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:05,726
He never gets up before you
on a Sunday morning.

262
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,461
Wait a second, I get it.

263
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:08,512
You're a lesbian.

264
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,980
<i>- What?
- Well, you must be.</i>

265
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:12,349
I mean, you just described
the perfect woman.

266
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,201
Why are you so threatened
by these qualities?

267
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:18,389
Is it perhaps because you don't
possess a single one of them

268
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,757
and that is the real reason

269
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,642
why women aren't
interested in you? Hm?

270
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:24,580
Okay. Okay, I'll give you
100 bucks of my own money

271
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:26,848
<i>to go get this guy
and bring him down here</i>

272
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,618
<i>and let me meet him.</i>

273
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,654
Well, he's out there,
somewhere.

274
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,122
<i>Wait a second.</i>

275
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,292
You're not even
dating this guy?

276
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:39,597
No, I'm describing a type.

277
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,383
I thought that's
what we were doing.

278
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,869
Ha-ha-ha! What?
You don't even know him?

279
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,372
Oh, whoa, okay,
now I get the picture.

280
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,527
Hold on. Oh, you're a dog.

281
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:51,459
What?

282
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,794
Well, you must be.

283
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,763
Come on, you heard me.
I mean, if you were...

284
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:56,349
If you were hot,
you would be out

285
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,101
<i>breaking some poor
schmuck's heart</i>

286
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:02,005
<i>instead of spending
all your time fantasizing</i>

287
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:03,373
<i>about Mr. Wonderful.</i>

288
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,376
<i>Face it, you're ugly.</i>

289
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:08,412
I am not ugly.

290
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,381
<i>Well, okay,</i>

291
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:11,798
let me help you out here.

292
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,636
You might as well face the fact
that you're gonna be alone,

293
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:17,038
<i>and stop pining away
for some fantasy guy</i>

294
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,106
<i>you're never gonna get.</i>

295
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:20,692
<i>- How can you possibly...?
- Hey, Lassie.</i>

296
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,344
<i>The show's called
The Ugly Truth.</i>

297
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:25,315
If you can't face it,
don't call.

298
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:26,983
<i>That about
wraps it up for this evening.</i>

299
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,419
<i>I'm Mike Chadway reminding you
that the truth is never pretty.</i>

300
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,321
<i>JOY:
How'd the date go?</i>

301
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:35,342
Well, I was very pleased
with the choice of restaurant.

302
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:37,545
- That is so awesome.
- Why?

303
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:39,130
Good morning, everyone.

304
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:40,464
Morning.

305
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:42,884
Now, before I play you this,
I should warn you,

306
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:46,304
this guy's a little rough
around the edges.

307
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:49,124
<i>Face it, you're ugly.</i>

308
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,159
<i>I am not ugly.</i>

309
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,897
<i>- Well...
- Why are we watching this?</i>

310
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,381
Say hello to
our new guest commentator.

311
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,250
I'm starting him off at
two segments a week,

312
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,485
three minutes a pop.

313
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,871
- Are you kidding me?
- Who the hell is this guy?

314
00:13:00,872 --> 00:13:03,391
- Name's Mike Chadway.
- He's an uber-moron

315
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:04,642
misogynist who represents

316
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:07,011
everything that is wrong
with television and society.

317
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:09,079
I get crap every time
I suggest we do something

318
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,616
even remotely fluffy.

319
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,633
Oh, come on.
He's got a point of view.

320
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:15,437
We don't have to like it.
I mean, we're newspeople.

321
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:16,422
We're objective.

322
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:18,274
Stone Phillips interviews
terrorists.

323
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,877
Doesn't mean he likes them,
he does it for the ratings.

324
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:22,845
I have a whole list of ideas
to improve ratings.

325
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:24,798
You're gonna like it.
We don't need him.

326
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:26,466
- We don't need him.
- Not at all.

327
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,052
"An intimate profile
of the mayor".

328
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:29,169
- Yes.
- I like that.

329
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,504
- I like the mayor.
- Fantastic.

330
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:31,805
The mayor?

331
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,525
Yes. It can be edgy
and yet intriguing.

332
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:35,710
Unless you can get him to bang
three crack whores

333
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:38,347
and a German shepherd
on live TV,

334
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,215
no one's gonna give a shit.

335
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:42,784
Oh, I'm sorry.

336
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:44,354
I was eavesdropping
out in the hall.

337
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:48,073
What did I tell you?
Isn't this guy great?

338
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,860
Oh, thanks, boss.

339
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:51,578
You already hired him?

340
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,764
Who's this
delightful creature?

341
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:57,285
I'm your producer.

342
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:59,703
Oh. Hey.

343
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:02,291
I like a woman on top.

344
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:05,543
Ugh. God.

345
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,763
- Nice office.
- Ha-ha! He's just kidding.

346
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,613
- Oh, yeah.
- Excuse me.

347
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:11,466
- Hey, Mike, you see your office?
- No, I didn't.

348
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,369
- Come on. Let me show you.
- Beautiful.

349
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,238
Everybody take five.
I'll be right back.

350
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,307
Were you all not there
last year...

351
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:18,708
for our
sexual-harassment meeting?

352
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:21,045
- Yes. Were you not there, Larry?
- He needs to go.

353
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:23,212
He wasn't
sexually harassing me.

354
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,133
I am an award-winning
news producer.

355
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:27,985
I am an award-winning
news producer.

356
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,238
I am an award-winning
news producer.

357
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,856
I am an awa...

358
00:14:31,857 --> 00:14:33,691
You're an award-winning
news producer.

359
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:34,977
You don't knock?

360
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,646
Well, I did knock.
You didn't answer.

361
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:39,248
So essentially,
your knock was negated

362
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:40,884
by your complete
lack of adherence

363
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:44,220
to the social etiquette
that follows a knock.

364
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:47,424
You're wound like a fucking top.

365
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:50,627
Woof, woof.
Remember the bark?

366
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,064
Last night, a little
phone conversation we had.

367
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:56,467
Yeah. Hey, what do you know?

368
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:58,187
You're not ugly at all.

369
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,588
Oh, well,
imagine my relief.

370
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:02,757
I want to thank you
for getting me this gig.

371
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:05,093
I would never have gotten it
without you.

372
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:07,863
You and I, we make good TV.

373
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:10,717
You make imbecilic trash
watched by housebound

374
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:12,452
inbreds who are so busy
with their hands

375
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,540
down their pants,
they can't change the remote.

376
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,709
I hadn't been picturing you
that way, but it's a nice image.

377
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,127
I do not watch
your program.

378
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,513
My cat stepped
on the remote.

379
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,834
Oh, you want to thank
your pussy for me, then?

380
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:27,985
Ugh!

381
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,858
Larry, Georgia, listen to me.
I want you to skewer him.

382
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:34,860
I want Mike Chadway
to go down in flames.

383
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,930
I want Mike Chadway to be
nothing but a pile of ash

384
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:38,231
on the seat next to you.

385
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:40,466
I want the janitor to come in
and vacuum up the ashes

386
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,201
of Mike Chadway
with his Dustbuster

387
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:44,271
and when he dumps it
in the Dumpster outside,

388
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:45,872
I want the rats to vomit
and defecate

389
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:47,941
on the ashes of Mike Chadway.

390
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:52,413
Wow. And I thought
you were angry and bitter.

391
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:56,252
Uh, no, Larry, that would be
my untouched vagina.

392
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:57,619
- Chadway?
- What?

393
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,487
Twenty seconds to air.

394
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:01,390
About ready? Larry?

395
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:03,058
There's a bird
in my dressing room.

396
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:04,226
I'll take care of it.

397
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:06,362
- A real bird?
- Yeah. It's flying around.

398
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:08,064
Why is there a bird
in his dressing room?

399
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,766
I don't know
what type of bird it is.

400
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:10,817
Security here is awful.

401
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:13,020
You guys have really got
to keep the doors closed.

402
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:14,372
Four, three...

403
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,741
Good morning, everyone,
I'm Larry Freeman.

404
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,476
Another beautiful day
in Sacramento.

405
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,296
<i>And I'm sitting here
with a beautiful woman.</i>

406
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,115
- Go, 1.
- All right, here we go.

407
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
<i>Thank you, Larry.</i>

408
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,501
<i>Hi. I'm Georgia Bordeney.</i>

409
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:28,288
Ready for the single on Georgia.

410
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,772
For years,
there have been concerns

411
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,941
about lowering
television standards.

412
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,510
But many believe that this man

413
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:35,846
and his local
public-access show

414
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:37,597
have brought things
to a new low.

415
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:40,468
<i>With that,
we welcome Mike Chadway.</i>

416
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:42,803
How you doing, guys?

417
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,188
Mike, how do you respond
to people

418
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:45,641
who say your show is offensive?

419
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:48,477
Well, it is.
But then again, so is the truth.

420
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:52,231
Ha. The truth about what,
Mr. Chadway?

421
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:54,700
What relationships
are really like.

422
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,318
Take marriage, for instance.

423
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,438
It's about social pressure,

424
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,376
status and sex.

425
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:04,044
If it weren't for these
three things,

426
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:05,746
men and women
wouldn't even speak.

427
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:08,966
Oh, dear. Sounds to me
like no one's ever loved you,

428
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:11,619
and you're taking that out
on the female population.

429
00:17:13,905 --> 00:17:15,306
<i>Good one.
It's like Crossfire.</i>

430
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:17,225
That was a good one.

431
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,428
<i>While we're making
these observations, Georgia,</i>

432
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,247
you two project this image
of the perfect couple,

433
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:23,649
when clearly it's a lie.

434
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:26,320
Excuse me?

435
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:29,022
Holy shit.
Oh. Break for commercial.

436
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:30,056
No, no, no.

437
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,225
Stuart said keep rolling
no matter what.

438
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:34,027
What? When? This is my show.

439
00:17:34,028 --> 00:17:37,582
BOTH:
Not right now, it isn't.

440
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,701
Come on, Larry.
I watched your show for years.

441
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:43,005
You used to be this cool,
confident cat.

442
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:44,639
What the hell
happened to you?

443
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,577
And you, Georgia. I mean,
this one's no dumb bunny.

444
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:51,180
She knew the only way she was
getting off the weekend shift

445
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,049
was by hooking up
with you.

446
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,186
Then, lo and behold, she became
more popular than you did.

447
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:57,637
<i>Ended up with twice
your salary.</i>

448
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:59,372
Come on, Larry, take him down.

449
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:00,774
Shh!

450
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:04,061
Hold on, pal. I am very proud
of my wife's success.

451
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:06,898
<i>Mm, baloney, you are.
You hate her success.</i>

452
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,600
You feel emasculated by her.

453
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:10,868
And that screws with your head.

454
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:14,339
<i>Which, in turn,
screws with your manhood.</i>

455
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,026
<i>What's your point, Mr. Chadway?</i>

456
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:20,163
<i>- Yes, Georgia, take control.
- My point, Georgia...</i>

457
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,866
My point is
that your husband

458
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,302
hasn't had
sex with you in...

459
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:28,088
I'm gonna say,
what, three months?

460
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:30,624
- Chadway, that is not my fault.
- I know.

461
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,895
- I mean, come on.
- I know, I know. It's her fault.

462
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:37,015
Why is it my fault?
What am I supposed to do?

463
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:38,818
Say no to the money
so he can get an erection?

464
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,402
She said "erection"
on network TV.

465
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:42,004
The other networks do it.
No big deal.

466
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,907
- They're talking about erections.
- Be quiet!

467
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,725
<i>They say "erection"
on Sesame Street.</i>

468
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:47,259
- I agree.
- Thank you.

469
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,830
You've economically
emasculated your husband

470
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:53,133
to such a point
that he's afraid to want you.

471
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,768
- Ugh.
- I mean, sure,

472
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,470
you could dump his ass, but,
honey,

473
00:18:56,471 --> 00:19:01,010
have you seen the eligible men
in Sacramento? Oh, God.

474
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:03,595
It's slim pickings for a woman
in her 40s, I can tell you.

475
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:05,264
Forties?

476
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:06,598
Oh, God.

477
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,550
Hold that shot
with Georgia and Mike.

478
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,135
He just talked about her age.

479
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:11,887
- She's gonna kill me.
- Well.

480
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,373
Forty?

481
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:15,908
I mean, you ain't gonna do
any better than Larry.

482
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,246
- You just have to let him be a man.
- Hm?

483
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,148
- Let him be a man, Georgia.
- I let him be a man.

484
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:22,215
You have to let me be a man.

485
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:23,685
I have tried to let you
be a man.

486
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,952
- Let him be a man.
- You have to let me be a man.

487
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:29,040
Simple as that. Now, you,
Frowny McFlaccid, come on.

488
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:29,975
Oh, God.

489
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,244
Ready for a three-shot.
Zoom In.

490
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,028
- I'm not frowny.
- Yes, you are.

491
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:36,298
Move in here and give
this beautiful woman a kiss.

492
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,216
Oh, God.

493
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,684
This is ridiculous.
McFlaccid?

494
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:41,288
- That mean what I think it means?
- Yes, it does. Kiss her.

495
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,890
No, no, no.
They're not gonna...

496
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,257
Give it to her,
right in front of me.

497
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:46,091
- And in front of them.
- Let me...

498
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:49,096
Goddamn it, Georgia,
let me be a man!

499
00:19:49,097 --> 00:19:52,317
- No!
- Oh! Zoom in on that, 2. Zoom in.

500
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:53,985
America doesn't wanna see this!

501
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:57,690
And that, my friends,
is the ugly truth.

502
00:19:57,691 --> 00:20:00,025
Get ready to roll to break.
Ready to roll...

503
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:03,162
Oh, you are a man.
He is a man. Break.

504
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,797
Cut to commercial!

505
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:06,365
Cut to commercial!

506
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,250
That was great!
Wasn't that great?

507
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,120
I told you
that guy was great.

508
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,422
Good job,
everybody. Wow!

509
00:20:13,674 --> 00:20:15,576
Abby?

510
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:19,397
Found her.

511
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:22,133
1,143 calls,

512
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:25,386
over 300 e-mails, 53 percent
of them were women.

513
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:28,423
This guy's
a lightning rod.

514
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:29,942
They liked him?

515
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:31,778
Liked him?
They loved him.

516
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:33,563
93 percent positive.

517
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,698
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

518
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:37,701
But I am
scaling back the news

519
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,320
<i>and giving it
to The Ugly Truth.</i>

520
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,437
Stuart, I really think
this is a mistake.

521
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:43,339
What do we even
know about this guy?

522
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,175
Who is he, really?

523
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:46,310
Moved here when he was 10,

524
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,797
pitched two consecutive
Little League Championships.

525
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:49,965
Cute.

526
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,449
Voted "Most Likely
to Get Slapped"

527
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,919
in his senior yearbook.
Three years at San José State.

528
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,488
Salesman of the Year at
Dobson Medical Supplies in '04.

529
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,541
Once arrested for urinating
out of a moving vehicle.

530
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,409
That is actually
incredibly challenging.

531
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,410
Tell me about it.

532
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:03,346
Never been married,
hates asparagus.

533
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,632
Look, let's just keep a smile
on this guy's face,

534
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,852
and we'll both get
our contracts renewed.

535
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:13,107
Congratulations?

536
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,909
<i>Mike. Hi, it's Lauren.</i>

537
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,278
<i>I'm having a party on Saturday
and you know what happens</i>

538
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,848
<i>when I drink tequila.
Ha-ha-ha.</i>

539
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:43,975
<i>It's me, Nikki.
Why haven't you called me? I miss you.</i>

540
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:45,777
<i>- I can't stop...
- Hey.</i>

541
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:47,279
<i>thinking about your huge...</i>

542
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,817
<i>Who's that?
Rubbing all over my...</i>

543
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:54,403
<i>- Dripping wet...
- How was...?</i>

544
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:57,640
How was school?

545
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,661
- Well, you totally hosed me.
- What?

546
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:03,363
Last week on your show,
you said,

547
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,898
"Always be mean to hot girls

548
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,302
because they'll want you more".
Well, I tried it on Shauna.

549
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,772
She cried,
and then I got detention.

550
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:14,060
First of all, don't listen
to what I say on my show.

551
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:18,112
Second of all, you're supposed
to do that to 25-year-old girls

552
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:20,983
who think they're hot and
can get any guy they want,

553
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,335
not 14-year-old girls.

554
00:22:23,336 --> 00:22:24,988
They're going through puberty.

555
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:27,457
They got enough problems.

556
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,025
Mom said when she was 14,

557
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:31,779
she was the prettiest girl
in class.

558
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,164
Well, I was there when
she was 14,

559
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,065
and let me tell you something.
She lied.

560
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,834
Don't listen to your Uncle Mike.

561
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:40,338
He was blind from touching
himself inappropriately.

562
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,958
Ha. That's a nice thing
to tell your son.

563
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,828
Like he hasn't heard worse
on your show.

564
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:49,099
Let's hope you can clean it up
now that you're on a network.

565
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,367
Congrats.

566
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,538
Oh!
D'Artagnan, no, you didn't!

567
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,291
No, D'Artagnan, you get
back here. Get back here.

568
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,626
No, do not... No, no, no.

569
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:20,300
D'Artagnan.

570
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:22,419
D'Artagnan!

571
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,220
Shit!

572
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,291
All right.

573
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,460
I'll just come up.

574
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:34,482
I'm really not that flexible,
D'Artagnan. I'm coming.

575
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:36,517
I got you, hold on.

576
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:38,787
Hold on. Come here, baby.

577
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:41,524
No, no. No, no. Come on.
Come here, D'Artagnan.

578
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:44,760
Good boy.
Oh, good boy. Okay.

579
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:47,364
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

580
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,431
Oh. I hope we can get down.

581
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:58,525
Oh, my.

582
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:06,018
Oh, my.

583
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:08,303
My, my.

584
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:12,358
Ooh.

585
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:15,077
He flosses.

586
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,120
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

587
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,624
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

588
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,457
I'm stuck in a tree!

589
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,295
Help me! Anybody!

590
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:32,748
- I'm stuck in a tree! I'm stuck!
- Stay, stay calm.

591
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:35,818
- You're gonna be fine.
- Get me down! Get me down!

592
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:40,256
Sorry. Oh, my God.

593
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:42,509
So you just moved in.
That's great.

594
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,177
I'm Abby, by the way.

595
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,430
Your neighbor
from across the way.

596
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:49,082
So you're a doctor? Wow.

597
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,534
An orthopedic surgeon.

598
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,253
Yeah, I do a lotta
leg and hip stuff,

599
00:24:52,254 --> 00:24:54,422
but I do get
the occasional foot.

600
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:56,157
Your ankle seems to be fine.

601
00:24:56,158 --> 00:24:57,860
Just a mild sprain,
so this should help.

602
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:59,328
Great. Thank you.

603
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:01,496
I guess I'm pretty lucky
my cat chose the tree

604
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:02,832
outside your window to climb.

605
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:06,385
Well, I'm here
whenever you need me.

606
00:25:06,386 --> 00:25:08,020
Look, I'm gonna put
my home number

607
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,455
on the back
of my business card.

608
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:11,557
If your ankle starts giving you
any problems,

609
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:13,093
just give me a call.

610
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,214
Great. Thanks.

611
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:20,686
Oh, wow, that's so weird.
He doesn't usually like men.

612
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,471
Well, you know,
dogs are great, but, uh...

613
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:25,473
I'm a cat person.

614
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:29,710
Yeah.

615
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:35,151
Well, I guess
I'll get going, then.

616
00:25:35,152 --> 00:25:36,986
Yeah.

617
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:38,455
Yeah.

618
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:42,758
Yeah. Ha-ha.

619
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,714
- Thanks again for saving my life.
- Anytime.

620
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:50,684
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

621
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:56,843
- You forgot your cat.
- Right.

622
00:25:56,844 --> 00:25:58,310
I had a spider on me. Ugh.

623
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:00,147
- Yeah.
- It's gone now, though. Good.

624
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:01,430
- All right, okay.
- Bye.

625
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:03,882
- Thanks again.
- Good night.

626
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:08,605
You are not gonna believe
how perfect he is.

627
00:26:08,606 --> 00:26:10,274
- Symmetrical?
- Oh, you have no idea.

628
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:11,643
- Oh, good Lord.
- Yeah.

629
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:12,744
Well, how did you leave it?

630
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,211
I mean, did he ask
for your number?

631
00:26:14,212 --> 00:26:15,280
No, but he gave me his.

632
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,881
So what do I do?
Should I call him?

633
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:18,550
If I call do call him,
what should I say?

634
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:19,984
- Okay. Take a breath.
- Uh-huh.

635
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:21,452
And please, sweetheart,

636
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:22,888
- No tap water.
- No tap water.

637
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:24,673
Don't bring it up.

638
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:25,991
You've got naughty eyes.

639
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:28,528
- Anyone ever tell you that?
- I have naughty everything.

640
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:29,662
Hold that thought.

641
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:32,215
No, hey,
you won't get in trouble.

642
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,150
Down a bit. Down a bit.

643
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,120
Okay.

644
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,622
Bye, Karen.

645
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:44,294
Keep it clean, moving,
stick to the script.

646
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,131
You are on a live
affiliate news program.

647
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:48,033
You do not have the luxury
of using the words

648
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,801
"blow" and "job"
in the same sentence.

649
00:26:49,802 --> 00:26:51,654
If you say anything
scatological,

650
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:53,339
you will be fired.

651
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,607
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

652
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:56,977
Because I kind of thought
that you were the one

653
00:26:56,978 --> 00:26:59,662
that was gonna get fired
if you don't keep me happy.

654
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:03,634
Yes. I've got a list of demands
that I would like to make

655
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:06,019
after the show,
and let me just warn you,

656
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,655
they're gonna be
scatological.

657
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,977
Ow. Ah.

658
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:15,598
You know, just because
you look pretty today,

659
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,850
I won't mention the misguided
phallic rage you just displayed.

660
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:20,603
When you hear my voice,
just do what I say.

661
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:22,471
Heh-heh.
Promise you'll talk dirty?

662
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:26,526
<i>Good morning,
Sacramento. I'm Larry Freeman.</i>

663
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,061
<i>And I'm Georgia Bordeney.</i>

664
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:29,396
<i>And I'm Mike Chadway.</i>

665
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,415
<i>And this is The Ugly Truth.</i>

666
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,101
Where we'll be taking
a few minutes every day

667
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:38,639
to talk about men, women
and relationships.

668
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,541
Let's start with men.

669
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,177
Men are simple.

670
00:27:42,178 --> 00:27:43,879
To illustrate my point,

671
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,431
here we have
a classic romantic setting.

672
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:51,104
We have, uh, candlelight,
champagne, and even

673
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:53,307
<i>your own personal violinist.</i>

674
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,175
<i>Now,</i>

675
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:57,777
<i>over here, we have something
quite different.</i>

676
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:00,547
<i>This isn't on my list.
Ha-ha-ha! Follow me.</i>

677
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:02,483
Is the segment over?

678
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,585
Where the hell's he going?

679
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:06,955
- Follow him. Follow him.
- Go with him, Remote.

680
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:08,457
Go with him, Remote 1.

681
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:12,745
Hey.
Babes wrestling in Jell-O.

682
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:15,846
- Oh, Jell-O. That's great.
- Hello? Abby?

683
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:17,716
There's people calling

684
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:19,502
- and freaking out.
- Oh, Jesus.

685
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:21,672
- Sit down!
- Turn the monitor up.

686
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:23,206
Let's take a quick survey

687
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:25,476
and see which option
the men out there would pick.

688
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,979
We have classical music
and candle-lit dinner,

689
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,535
or semi-naked chicks wrestling
in strawberry-flavored goo.

690
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:34,836
Aah!

691
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:38,440
Oh, shit.

692
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:40,508
All right.

693
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:43,712
If we're gonna do this,
we might as well milk it.

694
00:28:43,713 --> 00:28:46,750
Two, get ready to go wide.
One, tight on his hand.

695
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:49,452
Lick the Jell-O off her finger.

696
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:52,539
<i>Lick the Jell-O off her finger.</i>

697
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,007
Just do it.

698
00:29:03,402 --> 00:29:07,307
<i>I was wrong. It's cherry.</i>

699
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:10,408
<i>Back to you in the studio,
Georgia. Bye.</i>

700
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:12,210
<i>Uh...</i>

701
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,180
Coming up,
we're gonna visit the aquarium

702
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:16,149
and see how
Penny the Porpoise is doing.

703
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,916
Can she
clear that 10-foot pole

704
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,987
with a ball on her nose?
When we come back.

705
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:22,822
When we come back.

706
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,533
Chemistry.
I smell threesome.

707
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,568
Ah.

708
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:36,672
Great job, ladies.
I can still taste you.

709
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,057
You know what I mean.

710
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:43,063
Huh?
Do you realize that

711
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:45,616
I once had the Archbishop
Desmond Tutu on this show?

712
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,934
Who's that?

713
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,002
I can't even demonstrate
how far I've fallen

714
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,455
because you're not smart enough
to get the references.

715
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,158
Hey, wait, wait, wait. I thought
we were a great team back there.

716
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,160
You were the one that
told me to lick the Jell-O.

717
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,497
Do you understand
how much I hate myself for that?

718
00:29:58,498 --> 00:29:59,865
It was cheap titillation.

719
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,716
I am now going
to broadcasting hell

720
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,020
right behind the naked
weather girl from Canada.

721
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:07,673
Seriously?

722
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:09,975
There's a
naked weather girl?

723
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,511
Hey, can we get her?

724
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:14,297
You have to do it
for the ratings, Abby.

725
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:16,133
<i>Think of my son.</i>

726
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:18,669
<i>My son, who had a dream
of being a cosmetician.</i>

727
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,372
<i>Think about him.
Think about Joy.</i>

728
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:23,008
<i>Just do it for me.</i>

729
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:25,375
Today it'll be partly sunny
with a cloud cover moving in

730
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:27,512
from my left breast.

731
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,981
Low pressure systems
are moving up,

732
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:31,349
so expect a cold front.

733
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,326
<i>Watch Mike Chadway
on Sacramento A.M.,</i>

734
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:42,163
<i>giving us The Ugly Truth
each and every day</i>

735
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:43,814
<i>at 9:00, right here
on Channel 2.</i>

736
00:30:43,815 --> 00:30:45,749
Oh, God.

737
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,123
I used
to really like caviar,

738
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:54,025
until I found out it was
made out of fish eggs.

739
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,845
- Did you know that?
- Caviar's revolting.

740
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:58,130
- I almost started to gag.
- Morning, ladies.

741
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:00,300
- John.
- Yesterday's ratings.

742
00:31:00,301 --> 00:31:02,401
Oh. Thanks, John.

743
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:07,541
Guess I should be happy
about this, right?

744
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:11,077
Uh, yeah. Yeah. You've never
gotten a 12-share before.

745
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,615
I feel dirty.

746
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:15,383
Did you hear about
the ratings?

747
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:17,386
Yes,
I am the producer.

748
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:19,888
Well, then did you hear that
corporate's coming next week

749
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:21,390
to take me out to dinner?

750
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:23,993
Oh. Well, let's hope you can
chew with your mouth closed.

751
00:31:25,428 --> 00:31:26,762
Why do you hate my guts?

752
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:29,049
Your innards are of
no consequence to me.

753
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,266
It's what you represent.

754
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:31,901
- Oh, you hate the truth.
- Ha.

755
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:34,203
Your skewed perception
of male-female interaction

756
00:31:34,204 --> 00:31:35,773
is not the truth.

757
00:31:35,774 --> 00:31:38,625
But your imaginary
boyfriend's the truth?

758
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:41,979
For your information,
I happened to meet him.

759
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,663
Mm. Well, I hope
he's real this time,

760
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:45,332
because otherwise
this is just sad.

761
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,668
Oh, he's real.
He's very real.

762
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:51,139
Not to mention stunningly
handsome, morally sound.

763
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,826
He's a surgeon.
An orthopedic surgeon.

764
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:55,662
- You know what that means.
- What?

765
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,382
Had to stick his finger up
some guy's butt

766
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,516
in medical school.

767
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,383
You disgust me.

768
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,991
So did Butt Boy ask you out?

769
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,960
Not yet.

770
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:10,628
We're taking things slow,

771
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,230
getting to know
each other first.

772
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,831
Why am I
talking to you about this?

773
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:17,102
In other words,
he didn't actually ask you out.

774
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,143
What are you doing?

775
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,466
<i>Doctor's office.</i>

776
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:32,904
Hi. This is Abby Richter
calling for Dr. Anderson.

777
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:34,204
<i>Please hold.
Yes, I'll hold.</i>

778
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:35,272
- What're you doing?
- Shh!

779
00:32:35,273 --> 00:32:36,959
- Why are you calling this guy?
- Shh.

780
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,142
- Shh.
- No.

781
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:40,911
<i>- Dr. Anderson.
- Hi, Colin. This is Abby.</i>

782
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:43,581
Your neighbor
from last night.

783
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:47,303
Hey. Everything okay?

784
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:49,872
<i>How's the, uh,
ankle treating you?</i>

785
00:32:49,873 --> 00:32:52,075
Couldn't be better.

786
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,244
I was just calling
to let you know

787
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:57,112
how much I enjoyed
meeting you last night.

788
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,967
Thanks.

789
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:02,803
<i>Uh,
and I was thinking we should</i>

790
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:03,970
<i>go out for dinner sometime.</i>

791
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:05,157
Oh.

792
00:33:05,158 --> 00:33:07,876
There is a new
French bistro in town

793
00:33:07,877 --> 00:33:09,844
and an art opening
that got amazing reviews.

794
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:14,500
So I was thinking
we could go on Friday.

795
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:17,920
Um, Friday.
Oh. Wow.

796
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:20,840
<i>Would Saturday be better?
Actually,</i>

797
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:25,412
Abby, the thing is,
I haven't really settled in yet.

798
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:28,282
What the hell
are you doing?

799
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:30,101
I'm saving you.
He was blowing you off.

800
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:31,619
He wasn't blowing me off!

801
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,389
Don't. Okay, he'll be
expecting you to call him.

802
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,457
And when you don't,
he'll call back.

803
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,345
How do you know?
Because I know how men operate.

804
00:33:39,346 --> 00:33:41,663
If you want it to
work out with this guy,

805
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:44,033
then you'll listen to me,
and you'll do exactly as I say.

806
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:46,236
You've probably already done
irreparable damage

807
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:49,072
with your psycho-aggressive
control-freak phone call.

808
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:50,508
It might even be too late.

809
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:52,076
And if you do salvage
the situation,

810
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:54,010
you'll never be more than Abby,

811
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:55,711
his desperate neighbor.

812
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,965
I'm not desperate.

813
00:33:57,966 --> 00:34:00,385
Why? Did you think
I sounded desperate?

814
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,154
Listen to you.

815
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:04,723
Desperately asking me
if you sound desperate.

816
00:34:06,993 --> 00:34:09,011
- Ah! Oh!
- Okay.

817
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:11,180
Although you won't admit it,

818
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,867
you know that I know
what I'm talking about.

819
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:16,852
It's your call, dude.

820
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,706
Fine. What do I do?

821
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,357
Pick up and say, "Hey, Doug".

822
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,010
- Why would I...?
- Just do it.

823
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,629
Hey, Doug.

824
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,416
Uh, no.
This is Colin.

825
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,868
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.

826
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,253
That's perfect.

827
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,755
Uh, who's,
uh, Doug?

828
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:35,490
Who's Doug?

829
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:38,094
He's just a guy I'm seeing.
It's nothing serious.

830
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:41,348
Just a guy I'm seeing.
It's nothing serious.

831
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:44,735
Oh, okay.

832
00:34:44,736 --> 00:34:46,503
- Hang on a second.
- Hang on a second.

833
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:47,855
Sure.

834
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:50,473
Now what?

835
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:51,575
Now just make him wait.

836
00:34:51,576 --> 00:34:53,544
If he's still holding
after 30 more seconds,

837
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:54,979
you may
actually have a chance.

838
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,580
No one's gonna wait
for somebody

839
00:34:56,581 --> 00:34:57,782
they're trying to blow off.

840
00:34:57,783 --> 00:34:59,535
You better
be right about this.

841
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:00,635
Just give me a little time,

842
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:02,204
I'm gonna make this guy
your bitch.

843
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:04,407
I don't want a bitch.
Colin would never be a bitch.

844
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,542
He is a well-rounded man

845
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:10,346
capable of mature emotions
and deep, abiding love.

846
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,549
Things which
you know not of.

847
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,901
Maybe not.
But I do know about lust,

848
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:16,203
seduction and manipulation.

849
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:18,104
Things that you know not of.

850
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:20,958
Abby, I'll make you a deal.

851
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:23,729
If you do exactly as I say,
and you get this guy,

852
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,016
then you'll quit giving me shit
and you'll work with me.

853
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:30,168
You know as well as I do that
we could make this show huge.

854
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,389
And if it doesn't work?
What do I get?

855
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:36,659
Then I'll quit.

856
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,229
You're really
that confident?

857
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:47,254
It's been more than 30 seconds.

858
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:55,598
All right, deal. Now what?

859
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,600
Always make an impression.

860
00:35:57,601 --> 00:35:59,568
Let's get a move on.
We have work to do.

861
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:01,905
But what about the...?

862
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:04,007
In five seconds,
he'll call. Come on.

863
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,674
What are you,
Nostradamus?

864
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:08,945
Amazing.

865
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:13,467
Rule number one:
never criticize.

866
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:16,137
Even if it's constructive?
Never.

867
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:18,707
Men are incapable of growth,
change or progress.

868
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:21,427
For men, self-improvement
ends at toilet training.

869
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:23,496
- Huh.
- Mm.

870
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:26,398
And rule number two:
laugh at whatever he says.

871
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,500
What if what he says
isn't funny?

872
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:29,735
That's irrelevant.

873
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,771
A fake laugh is like
a fake orgasm.

874
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,889
A fake orgasm is good?

875
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,610
No, but a fake orgasm
is better than no orgasm at all.

876
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:38,212
A fake orgasm is no orgasm.
Only to you.

877
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:40,866
You're not the only person
in the room, you know.

878
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:42,984
Let's not be selfish.

879
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:44,702
Now, that was perfect.

880
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,771
Real or fake?

881
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,373
You'll never know.

882
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:51,593
<i>¶ My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high ¶</i>

883
00:36:51,594 --> 00:36:54,663
Rule number three:
men are very visual.

884
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:56,699
We have to change your look.

885
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,368
What's wrong with my look?

886
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,238
Abby, you're a very
attractive woman,

887
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,940
but you are completely
inaccessible.

888
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:04,741
You're all about
comfort and efficiency.

889
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:06,727
What's wrong with comfort
and efficiency?

890
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,230
Well, nothing,
except no one wants to fuck it.

891
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:13,134
Hello. May I be of assistance?
Yes, you may.

892
00:37:13,135 --> 00:37:14,937
We need cocktail dresses,

893
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:17,840
tight jeans and some bras
that'll make my friend's breasts

894
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:20,910
sit up and say hello.

895
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:23,078
They're not saying hello now?
What are they saying?

896
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,582
Actually, they're giving off
more of a passing nod

897
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,618
rather than
an outright greeting.

898
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:30,420
You know what?
Why don't you try this on?

899
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:32,239
I think this would be wonderful.
Ha-ha!

900
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,274
Now, that is a bra.

901
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:36,276
Mm-hm.
Boobies in this thing say,

902
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:38,980
"Put me in your mouth,
I taste good".

903
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:42,550
I'm actually wearing one
right now as we speak.

904
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:46,071
Length is very important.

905
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:48,408
We need short enough
to see some thigh,

906
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:51,143
but not so short to see vag.

907
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,680
Mm. Vag says
you're trying too hard.

908
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:55,015
You think?

909
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:57,651
Jeans are all about
the curvature of the ass.

910
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,720
You've... Well,
you've got the raw materials.

911
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:02,055
Now all you need is
the proper presentation.

912
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,657
Did you just tell me
I have a nice ass?

913
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:05,091
Do you always have
to be so crass?

914
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:06,594
Oh!

915
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:09,497
Rule number four:
never talk about your problems

916
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,634
because men don't
really listen or care.

917
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:14,470
- Some men care.
- No, some men pretend to care.

918
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:17,006
When we ask you how you're
doing, it's just guy code for:

919
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:18,474
"Let me stick
my dick in your ass".

920
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:19,792
Ugh!

921
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:22,162
Oh, I know you think
Colin is above it all,

922
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,764
but trust me, he's a guy.

923
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:26,333
If he's even remotely into you,
he's probably thought about

924
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:28,670
each one of your orifices
at least 10 times.

925
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:31,489
I love how you assume all men
are as perverse as you are.

926
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,910
Oh, I don't assume.
I know.

927
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,762
Wait. We need to make
one more stop.

928
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:39,415
Why? I have tons of stuff.

929
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,117
Nah, we have to make
your hair longer.

930
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,552
Men like something to grab onto
other than your ass.

931
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:45,722
My hair is fine. There's
nothing wrong with my hair.

932
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,608
Abby, a ponytail implies
that you are either

933
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:51,629
operating heavy machinery
or emptying the litter box.

934
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,714
Neither of those things
inspires an erection.

935
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:55,982
Why is it my responsibility
to inspire an erection?

936
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,384
Why isn't that his job?

937
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:59,085
Shut up.

938
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,962
Well? What do you think?

939
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,563
Uh... Not bad.

940
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:25,267
I just...

941
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:27,769
I don't wanna be perceived
as a bimbo. I mean...

942
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,721
And I don't want you
to be a bimbo.

943
00:39:29,722 --> 00:39:32,708
You have to be two people:
the saint and the sinner.

944
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:35,978
The librarian
and the stripper.

945
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:38,497
On the one hand,
you have to push the guy away

946
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:40,332
with a cold indifference,

947
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:45,304
on the other, you have to be
a sexually teasing tornado.

948
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,826
Now, we have to teach
you flirting.

949
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:48,976
I know how to flirt.

950
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:50,411
You know how to flirt?

951
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:53,181
"Oh, my name's Abby,
and I love reading Tolstoy.

952
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,584
I also love cats, gardening,
and romantic picnics".

953
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:58,252
I don't think so.

954
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:00,506
Hey, babe,
you wearing any underwear?

955
00:40:00,507 --> 00:40:01,840
Hey, you know what?

956
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:03,742
I wouldn't say that,
and I wouldn't grab ass.

957
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:05,745
What's wrong
with a little ass-grabbing?

958
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,714
- What's it there for if not to grab it?
- Oh!

959
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:11,084
You're just a set of orifices
and a pair of teetahs.

960
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:15,689
And you are a deeply,
deeply disturbed person.

961
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:20,027
Hm. Maybe I'm just
a really good student.

962
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:22,397
- Would you stop doing that?
- Doing what?

963
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:26,736
Uh, running your finger
down there.

964
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:27,937
Over me.

965
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:29,655
Why?
Is it turning you on?

966
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:34,077
- Maybe.
- Heh.

967
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:37,012
It's weird,
I think I kinda like it.

968
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:38,882
Really?

969
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,951
- Sucker.
- Oh, I knew it.

970
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:43,019
- Okay, no teaching the teacher.
- Come on.

971
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:46,191
- Who is it?
- It's Colin.

972
00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:48,059
I'm not ready for this.
Am I ready for this?

973
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,795
- I'm not ready for this.
- Calm down. Shh!

974
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:53,431
Okay. Keep the conversation
under a minute. Now go.

975
00:40:53,432 --> 00:40:54,972
- Under a minute?
- Yes.

976
00:40:54,973 --> 00:40:56,552
Under a minute.

977
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:59,788
No, wait, wait, wait.
Come here, come here.

978
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:02,392
You're such an asshole.

979
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,962
- Hi.
- Hey.

980
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,916
- Wow, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.

981
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,984
Yeah, I was just
doing the dishes.

982
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:13,838
- So, what happened to you today?
- What'd you mean?

983
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,040
Well, you put me on hold
and you never called back.

984
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,510
- Oh, my God. Was that you?
- Yeah.

985
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:21,379
- I'm so sorry.
- Ah, it's okay.

986
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,767
Uh, Colin, would you mind
giving me a call later?

987
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:27,186
I'm just so busy.
Gotta get back to those dishes.

988
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:29,739
- Abby, wait.
- What now?

989
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:33,693
No, that's good.
Now make him suffer.

990
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:34,929
Make him suffer. Suffer.

991
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,131
Abby, I was wondering
if you'd like to go

992
00:41:37,132 --> 00:41:39,800
to the Devils game
with me on Saturday.

993
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:49,010
Go, Comets!

994
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:51,163
<i>ANNOUNCER
He delivers it.</i>

995
00:41:56,536 --> 00:42:00,006
<i>Okay, I have
a visual. Nod if you can hear me.</i>

996
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,595
Just relax.
It's gonna be fine.

997
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:06,779
<i>Now, do exactly
what I tell you,</i>

998
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,182
<i>and when
I tell you to do it. Okay?</i>

999
00:42:10,436 --> 00:42:14,205
<i>You follow baseball?
Do something noncommittal.</i>

1000
00:42:15,842 --> 00:42:17,092
Eh. Ha-ha-ha.

1001
00:42:17,093 --> 00:42:18,694
You okay?

1002
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:20,130
I'm fine.

1003
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:22,348
<i>That was a little over the top,
but nice try.</i>

1004
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:26,169
- Well, thanks.
- For what?

1005
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:30,207
Well, thanks for being you.

1006
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:33,011
- Mm-hm.
- You're welcome.

1007
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,755
Excuse me.

1008
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:47,526
Oh, my God.
You're Mike Chadway.

1009
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:48,928
I love you.

1010
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:51,781
- Hey, buddy, what the hell?
- Dude, what the fuck?

1011
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:53,416
- Dude, what the fuck?
- What?

1012
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,219
<i>No, no, no.
I'm not talking to you.</i>

1013
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,539
I'm not talking to you.
Okay, did I do something wrong?

1014
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:01,692
No, stop. Listen.

1015
00:43:01,693 --> 00:43:05,212
Tell him you saw him
looking at another girl.

1016
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:06,698
I... I saw you.

1017
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:08,500
I saw you
looking at another girl.

1018
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:11,504
- Who?
- That girl, right there.

1019
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,473
I was trying to get us
a couple hot dogs.

1020
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:17,394
- Oh. Okay.
- Two. Thank you.

1021
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,112
Okay, we need a quick recovery.

1022
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,314
Um...

1023
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:23,650
<i>Make sure you put the hot dog</i>

1024
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:27,420
<i>in your mouth nice and slowly.</i>

1025
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:30,692
Men like watching

1026
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:33,796
<i>penis-shaped food
go into a girl's mouth.</i>

1027
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:35,547
- Oh!
- Oh!

1028
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,616
I'm so sorry.

1029
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:39,751
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No, it's okay. Really.

1030
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:42,121
You know, I can get this out.
I'm sure I can.

1031
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:44,406
- What kind of fabric is this?
- I don't know. Cotton?

1032
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:46,043
Cotton. Ooh. Cotton's the worst.

1033
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:48,295
Well, actually,
leather's the worst.

1034
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:49,729
- After that would be suede.
- Okay.

1035
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,599
<i>- I think I can get it out.
- Abby.</i>

1036
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,167
Oh, look,
hold on. It's coming!

1037
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,731
- Where?
- There. Right there.

1038
00:44:05,732 --> 00:44:08,651
<i>Abby? Abby,
you might wanna look up.</i>

1039
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:16,258
<i>Way to go, Abby.</i>

1040
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:21,715
Okay, I got you.
I'm in position.

1041
00:44:21,716 --> 00:44:23,100
Can't say today
was boring.

1042
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:24,485
You're being nice.

1043
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:26,921
- I embarrassed you.
- No.

1044
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:29,508
You're just, uh,
not what I'm used to.

1045
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:30,977
I know.

1046
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,845
No, actually,
it's a good thing.

1047
00:44:32,846 --> 00:44:35,647
I'm used to women I can
figure out in five seconds.

1048
00:44:35,648 --> 00:44:37,767
But I can't
do that with you.

1049
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:41,503
<i He's an idiot.
I figured you out in two.

1050
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:44,140
<i>Now, tell him good night
and stick your tits out.</i>

1051
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:46,360
<i>We're gonna give
this one last shot.</i>

1052
00:44:46,361 --> 00:44:48,696
Well, good night then.

1053
00:44:59,709 --> 00:45:01,961
That definitely made up
for my wet crotch.

1054
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:03,328
Ha. Me too.

1055
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:05,215
No, scratch that.
I didn't have one.

1056
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,167
Yeah. Ha-ha.

1057
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:08,618
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

1058
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:09,769
- Okay.
- Bye.

1059
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,539
Bye.

1060
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,641
Night.

1061
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:16,727
Night.

1062
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:22,149
Oh!

1063
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,907
You did it! You did it!
You did it!

1064
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:29,174
I didn't do anything.
You did!

1065
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:30,443
- It was you.
- No.

1066
00:45:30,444 --> 00:45:33,630
I mean, don't ask me why,
but I think he likes you.

1067
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:36,749
- He's such a great guy, right?
- Yeah, he's dreamy.

1068
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,420
Yeah. And he fits all 10
of the criteria on my checklist.

1069
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:41,455
Right. Though weren't items
one through nine

1070
00:45:41,456 --> 00:45:43,641
something to do with him
pretty much being gay?

1071
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:46,177
I'm gonna ignore that,

1072
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:48,396
because I am in such
a good mood.

1073
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:52,150
Yeah, I heard. Wet crotch.

1074
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:05,248
Of all the primates,
bonobo monkeys

1075
00:46:05,249 --> 00:46:07,618
are the closest relatives
to human beings

1076
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,886
both genetically and socially.

1077
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:12,790
Especially when
it comes to sex.

1078
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,692
They use sex
as a way to end an argument.

1079
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:16,928
One of my favorite
techniques as well.

1080
00:46:16,929 --> 00:46:19,582
In fact, when they come upon
a new food source,

1081
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:22,418
they have a gangbang
in order to decrease tension...

1082
00:46:22,419 --> 00:46:25,055
- Small person on-set.
- Thanks.

1083
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:27,506
...which is something
we humans should look into.

1084
00:46:27,507 --> 00:46:29,708
No, no, no.
This is not for children.

1085
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:31,277
It's okay. I know him.

1086
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:32,878
- You do?
- Yeah.

1087
00:46:32,879 --> 00:46:35,816
...sit on their asses
all day and boss their men around.

1088
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:39,787
Sounds like a great argument
for evolution if you ask me.

1089
00:46:39,788 --> 00:46:42,491
And that, my friends,
is the ugly truth.

1090
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:44,126
And we're wrapped.

1091
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:45,426
Heh-heh.
Great job, Mike.

1092
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,913
Thank you.
See you guys later.

1093
00:46:48,748 --> 00:46:50,782
Yeah, I've got an adult
male bonobo monkey

1094
00:46:50,783 --> 00:46:52,085
in my pants.

1095
00:46:52,086 --> 00:46:54,320
I'd like to see that.

1096
00:46:54,988 --> 00:46:56,589
Hey. What are you
doing here?

1097
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,311
I told you no watching
the show, especially live.

1098
00:47:00,312 --> 00:47:02,146
JONAH:
I need some emergency advice.

1099
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:04,482
Tracy Mclvor asked me
to the Sadie Hawkins dance.

1100
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:06,934
Is it dorky if I say yes?

1101
00:47:06,935 --> 00:47:08,084
Dorky?

1102
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:11,072
Hell, no. Are you kidding?

1103
00:47:11,073 --> 00:47:14,359
You're ahead of the game.
Women are coming to you.

1104
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,679
You know
how cool that is?

1105
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,181
Relish
this moment, okay?

1106
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:21,585
Now get the hell out of here.
I'll see you at 5.

1107
00:47:21,586 --> 00:47:22,919
- Okay.
- We'll celebrate.

1108
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,987
JONAH:
Don't forget the pizza, King Kong.

1109
00:47:24,988 --> 00:47:27,691
Hey, have I ever?

1110
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:29,493
He lives with you?

1111
00:47:29,494 --> 00:47:32,730
Well, next door, with my sister.

1112
00:47:32,731 --> 00:47:34,432
Oh.
He's my nephew.

1113
00:47:34,433 --> 00:47:35,633
Oh.

1114
00:47:35,634 --> 00:47:37,303
- Cute kid.
- Yeah.

1115
00:47:37,304 --> 00:47:39,705
Here, uh, do me.

1116
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:43,109
- Okay. So guess what.
- What?

1117
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,444
Colin called, he wants
to get together again.

1118
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,115
Oh, Lord.

1119
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:53,320
Um, so how long should I wait
to have sex with him?

1120
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:55,456
Well, the more you
make him beg for it,

1121
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,792
the more you're gonna
keep him on the hook.

1122
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:00,729
So do everything else but.

1123
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,365
But then show him

1124
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:07,736
that beneath that control-freak
exterior of yours,

1125
00:48:07,737 --> 00:48:11,273
that there's a sexual deviant
waiting to be unleashed.

1126
00:48:11,274 --> 00:48:14,777
No. No, I'm not
a sexual deviant. Mm-mm.

1127
00:48:14,778 --> 00:48:16,212
Good point.

1128
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,849
I'm guessing you've been
out of practice for what,

1129
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,485
- a year?
- No.

1130
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:23,554
- Eleven months.
- God.

1131
00:48:23,555 --> 00:48:26,156
Eleven months.
How do you live? Come on.

1132
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:30,362
So how often do you, uh...?

1133
00:48:30,363 --> 00:48:32,497
Do I what?

1134
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:35,100
- Do I what?
- You know,

1135
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:37,253
flick the bean?

1136
00:48:37,254 --> 00:48:38,504
What bean?

1137
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:41,640
- Your bean. Flick it. Down there.
- Oh!

1138
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:43,792
Gross! That's what you call it?
What is wrong with you?

1139
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:45,928
No, well, actually,
I call it masturbating,

1140
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:47,997
but I thought that might
offend your delicate

1141
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:50,901
ladylike sensibilities.

1142
00:48:50,902 --> 00:48:53,321
- So how often do you flick it?
- I don't know.

1143
00:48:53,322 --> 00:48:54,805
How often do you flick it?

1144
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,243
You're only asking me that so
you can picture me flicking mine

1145
00:48:58,244 --> 00:49:00,194
- while you flick yours.
- Oh, no.

1146
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:02,280
I would never picture you
while I do that,

1147
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:03,515
which is
not something I do.

1148
00:49:03,516 --> 00:49:05,584
- I don't do that, not ever.
- Yes, you would.

1149
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:07,085
- No. No. No.
- Never?

1150
00:49:07,086 --> 00:49:09,589
I find it impersonal.

1151
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,323
Abby, what could be
more personal

1152
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,109
than you
flicking your bean?

1153
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,095
I just don't see myself
that way, okay?

1154
00:49:15,096 --> 00:49:18,397
Okay, well, I do.
Come here. Ahem.

1155
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:20,584
Well, you better start.

1156
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:23,053
Because if you don't
wanna have sex with you,

1157
00:49:23,054 --> 00:49:25,590
- why the hell would Colin?
- Hm.

1158
00:49:40,774 --> 00:49:44,076
What is this?
What is this, baby?

1159
00:49:46,114 --> 00:49:47,932
What? What, baby?

1160
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,390
What is this?
What is this, D'Artagnan?

1161
00:49:58,127 --> 00:50:00,012
"Astrea 1".

1162
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:05,769
Oh. "Vibrating brief". Wow.

1163
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:25,140
Great.

1164
00:51:06,537 --> 00:51:08,906
He said he was running late.

1165
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:11,742
Ugh. What is he
doing here already?

1166
00:51:22,472 --> 00:51:24,991
Good, you're ready.
For what?

1167
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:26,860
The dinner
with corporate.

1168
00:51:26,861 --> 00:51:28,411
- Didn't you get my e-mail?
- No.

1169
00:51:28,412 --> 00:51:31,147
And I can't.
I have a date with Colin.

1170
00:51:31,148 --> 00:51:32,882
You can't go because
you have a date?

1171
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:36,553
You have no idea how hard
those are for her to get.

1172
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:40,308
Well, then let's pick
him up on the way.

1173
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,410
Come on, let's go.
Right now.

1174
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:44,512
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

1175
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:47,716
Sorry to hijack
your date, brother.

1176
00:51:47,717 --> 00:51:50,152
No worries.
You're a producer as well?

1177
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:52,621
No, dude,
I'm the talent.

1178
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:54,957
So you're, uh...
You're an anchor, then?

1179
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:57,293
<i>No, I do
The Ugly Truth.</i>

1180
00:51:57,294 --> 00:51:59,396
Hasn't he ever seen
our show?

1181
00:51:59,397 --> 00:52:00,781
Come on, Stuart.

1182
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:03,617
Our show's way too
low-brow for Colin.

1183
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:05,987
- He's a doctor.
- Yes.

1184
00:52:05,988 --> 00:52:07,372
That's right, he is.

1185
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:09,474
He doesn't wanna hear about
things like implants

1186
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,242
and oral sex.

1187
00:52:11,243 --> 00:52:12,910
You talk about oral sex?

1188
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:14,612
Oh, look, we're here.

1189
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,951
You invited
the Jell-O twins?

1190
00:52:18,952 --> 00:52:20,554
Yeah. I thought
it was good thinking.

1191
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,289
Well, it certainly
can't hurt.

1192
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,591
Ladies,
you look quite fetching.

1193
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:30,697
Hey, hey, the gang's all here.

1194
00:52:30,698 --> 00:52:31,932
BOB:
Hey.

1195
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:34,202
Harold, Bob, you remember Abby.
Hi. And this is...

1196
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:36,187
And we all know Mike Chadway.

1197
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:37,890
And who are these
lovely ladies?

1198
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:41,125
Something tells me we won't be
talking about the news tonight.

1199
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:42,427
That's right.

1200
00:52:43,597 --> 00:52:45,598
Our table's waiting. Shall we?

1201
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,548
Come this way.

1202
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:48,100
You're doing
a hell of a job.

1203
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:49,969
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

1204
00:52:51,888 --> 00:52:54,173
- That's a good one, huh?
- That is funny.

1205
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,943
HAROLD:
Thank you.

1206
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,968
So you guys here
to give me a raise or what?

1207
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:07,472
Ow!

1208
00:53:08,758 --> 00:53:11,828
Oh, that's my guy,
always with the jokes.

1209
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:17,100
Yeah.

1210
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:19,486
Yeah. Right.

1211
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,824
No, really,
we are very excited

1212
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,059
about this year's rating
increases. And we're hoping

1213
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,528
that in the next quarter, we...

1214
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:29,213
Oh, God.
What's wrong?

1215
00:53:29,214 --> 00:53:30,782
Nothing. Nothing.

1216
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:36,205
Um... Could you excuse me?

1217
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:39,174
- Shit.
- Sorry, she's...

1218
00:53:43,013 --> 00:53:46,049
What are you doing?
I'm looking for the remote.

1219
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,518
- What remote?
- For the... Oh!

1220
00:53:51,055 --> 00:53:53,524
The underwear.

1221
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:54,525
What?

1222
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:57,462
You're wearing them now?

1223
00:53:58,565 --> 00:54:00,265
Oh! Wow.

1224
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:01,899
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1225
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:07,573
Yeah.

1226
00:54:07,574 --> 00:54:12,495
Mm. This ceviche, it's so good.

1227
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:17,301
Quite possibly the best
I have ever tasted. Oh.

1228
00:54:17,302 --> 00:54:19,153
Yeah. I'm gonna ask the chef
for the recipe.

1229
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:20,554
Abby, uh, hold on.

1230
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:23,007
Tell Harold about
the new teaser campaign

1231
00:54:23,008 --> 00:54:25,844
we're starting next week.
You're gonna love this.

1232
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:29,097
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

1233
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:37,658
Well, they're, uh...
They're 15 seconds

1234
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:41,411
every hour, on the hour.

1235
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:43,831
Yep. Yep, yep.

1236
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:48,169
They're so,

1237
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:49,804
so...

1238
00:54:49,805 --> 00:54:53,759
You tell them, Mike.
You should tell them. Yes, yes.

1239
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,511
Yes, you tell them.

1240
00:54:55,512 --> 00:54:57,496
Actually,
I was really enjoying

1241
00:54:57,497 --> 00:55:00,699
the way you were
telling them. It was great.

1242
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:05,105
You were...
You were telling them.

1243
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:06,807
What's in ceviche?

1244
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:10,945
They're, um...

1245
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:14,765
They're unlike anything
you have ever felt.

1246
00:55:14,766 --> 00:55:16,235
Amazing.

1247
00:55:16,236 --> 00:55:17,902
And they're of...

1248
00:55:17,903 --> 00:55:20,538
Of Mike telling an ugly truth,

1249
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:22,040
and they are just so...

1250
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:24,126
So cutting-edge.

1251
00:55:25,712 --> 00:55:27,580
So... So fantastic.
So fantastic!

1252
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:29,899
Oh, God!
Oh, it's so, so great!

1253
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,203
Oh, God. Yeah!
You're gonna love them.

1254
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:38,976
Well, gotta love her
enthusiasm, right?

1255
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:46,534
I'm gonna use the restroom,

1256
00:55:46,535 --> 00:55:49,370
if you'll excuse me.

1257
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:54,292
Sorry, buddy, that's my toy.

1258
00:55:55,428 --> 00:55:57,363
Did you know
he had it the whole time?

1259
00:55:57,364 --> 00:56:00,766
Not the whole time,
just part of the time.

1260
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,869
I figured I should
let you finish.

1261
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,438
How kind.

1262
00:56:04,439 --> 00:56:07,125
So thanks for coming tonight.

1263
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:08,459
To dinner.

1264
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,061
- That kind of coming.
- Mm-hm.

1265
00:56:13,966 --> 00:56:17,768
He likes you, by the way.
Colin.

1266
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:18,938
I can tell.

1267
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:19,989
Really?

1268
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:21,807
We ready to go?

1269
00:56:21,808 --> 00:56:22,857
Yeah.

1270
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:25,027
- I know Abby is.
- Great.

1271
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:26,563
Let's go.

1272
00:56:26,564 --> 00:56:28,798
- Take care. Thanks.
- Okay.

1273
00:56:36,274 --> 00:56:38,609
Well, that went well,
I think.

1274
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,244
- Sure did. Let's get a drink.
- Yeah.

1275
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:41,646
Bob and Harold...

1321
00:58:44,635 --> 00:58:48,504
Uh-huh. Okay. Just conference me
when you get a hold of her.

1322
00:58:48,505 --> 00:58:50,623
Okay, bye. All right,

1323
00:58:50,624 --> 00:58:52,676
so we have
the balloon festival coming up

1324
00:58:52,677 --> 00:58:55,146
and I thought for sweeps,
it might be nice to do a segment

1325
00:58:55,147 --> 00:58:56,898
on how men are full of hot air.

1326
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:59,300
- Right? It's good, right?
- Heh. No.

1327
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:01,520
No. Well, we should still
do some stuff on location,

1328
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:04,106
because you're great when
you're interacting with people.

1329
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:08,243
I'm sorry, did you just
say I'm great?

1330
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,165
Yeah, you kind of are.

1331
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,768
Hm. Back at you, babe.

1332
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:19,573
So tell me this.

1333
00:59:19,574 --> 00:59:23,344
Why hasn't some fancy
New York show stolen you away?

1334
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:26,565
Oh, I much prefer
Sacramento to New York.

1335
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:28,833
Ha. Come on.

1336
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:31,187
You just like being
a big fish in a little pond.

1337
00:59:31,188 --> 00:59:34,023
- No. No.
- Mm.

1338
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:35,808
And Sacramento
isn't really a pond,

1339
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:39,446
it's more of a lake,
or even an estuary. Hm.

1340
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:42,799
And it's a great place
to raise a family.

1341
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,567
Uh, really good
school system.

1342
00:59:44,568 --> 00:59:46,970
The parks are clean
and well-maintained and safe.

1343
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:48,456
And there's a much lower

1344
00:59:48,457 --> 00:59:50,658
divorce rate here than
there is in New York.

1345
00:59:58,467 --> 00:59:59,969
Yes, well...

1346
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:03,438
Thank God Colin would never
be into a woman like that.

1347
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:07,043
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Colin only
likes women of quality, huh?

1348
01:00:07,044 --> 01:00:09,829
That's a trait to be admired,
not mocked, man-whore.

1349
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,651
Man-whore?
Why am I a man-whore?

1350
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,703
I've seen you with
the Funbag Twins, remember?

1351
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:17,456
Saw me what?

1352
01:00:17,457 --> 01:00:20,724
What, you saw me introduce them
to some network executives?

1353
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:22,393
They wanna be actresses, baby.

1354
01:00:22,394 --> 01:00:24,880
I mean, who am I
to kill their dream?

1355
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:27,499
Mm, such a generous man.

1356
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,802
Now, you're telling me
you've never slept with them?

1357
01:00:29,803 --> 01:00:32,889
Well, no, I didn't say that.
That's my point.

1358
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:35,509
Men, or man-whores,

1359
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:40,064
prefer women in slutty clothes
who suck lots of cock.

1360
01:00:40,065 --> 01:00:42,232
Every man wants that.

1361
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:43,700
And for your information,

1362
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:45,736
I only slept with the one
who could read.

1363
01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:49,191
Wait a second,
did you just say "cock"?

1364
01:00:49,192 --> 01:00:51,627
Yes. Yes, I did.

1365
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:54,429
I can say "cock".
You don't own the word. Cock.

1366
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:56,800
Cock, cock, cock.

1367
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:58,834
Okay, I got it.

1368
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:01,738
A week ago, you were crying
at the thought of a vibrator.

1369
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:04,607
Now you're, "cock this,
cock that," cock, cock, cock.

1370
01:01:07,429 --> 01:01:09,013
You slept with Colin,
didn't you?

1371
01:01:09,014 --> 01:01:11,732
No. No.

1372
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,603
We didn't. We're saving
that for this weekend.

1373
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:18,941
He's taking me
to Lake Tahoe.

1374
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,477
Wow.

1375
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,733
Wow.

1376
01:01:28,335 --> 01:01:30,171
Well,

1377
01:01:30,172 --> 01:01:33,340
here's to overturning
assumptions, huh?

1378
01:01:34,909 --> 01:01:37,177
I'm really a man
of discriminating taste

1379
01:01:37,178 --> 01:01:39,080
and you're a foul-mouthed slut.

1380
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:41,582
Thank you.

1381
01:01:44,186 --> 01:01:46,421
<i>So there you have it.</i>

1382
01:01:46,422 --> 01:01:50,559
<i>Never assume a girl is easy
or assume she's a prude.</i>

1383
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,561
<i>There are many layers
in between.</i>

1384
01:01:52,562 --> 01:01:55,932
<i>And it's your job, gentlemen,
to peel back those layers</i>

1385
01:01:55,933 --> 01:02:00,237
and figure out exactly what type
of woman you're dealing with.

1386
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:02,406
That sounded
almost enlightened.

1387
01:02:02,407 --> 01:02:05,844
Because once you do peel back
those layers, my friends,

1388
01:02:05,845 --> 01:02:08,496
her lady garden awaits.

1389
01:02:08,497 --> 01:02:10,166
And he's back.

1390
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,267
And I'm pretty sure you're gonna
wanna fertilize

1391
01:02:12,268 --> 01:02:13,868
that patch of petunias.

1392
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:16,889
Well, thanks, Mike.

1393
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:19,792
Coming up after this message,
Javier tells us if your petunias

1394
01:02:19,793 --> 01:02:22,763
are gonna see any rainfall
this weekend.

1395
01:02:22,764 --> 01:02:25,064
I sure hope mine do.

1396
01:02:25,065 --> 01:02:27,401
I wanna go home, but let's
go over the script right now.

1397
01:02:27,402 --> 01:02:30,972
Yeah, let's get it done
really quickly.

1398
01:02:30,973 --> 01:02:34,458
I'm turned on with the layers.
Want to see these layers?

1399
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,910
- There he is.
- Hey, what's up?

1400
01:02:35,911 --> 01:02:37,845
Good news.
You're not gonna believe this.

1401
01:02:37,846 --> 01:02:39,782
<i>What?
I got you on The Late Late Show</i>

1402
01:02:39,783 --> 01:02:43,535
with Craig Ferguson.
They want you as his guest.

1403
01:02:43,536 --> 01:02:45,121
Craig Ferguson wants me
on his show?

1404
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:46,289
Yeah.

1405
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,307
You're shitting me.
I am not shitting you.

1406
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:49,660
- Oh, yeah!
- We made it.

1407
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:54,180
Yes!

1408
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:56,500
Hi. Who are you?

1409
01:02:56,501 --> 01:02:57,551
Oh, this is Rick.

1410
01:02:57,552 --> 01:02:59,804
- I'm his agent.
- Yeah.

1411
01:02:59,805 --> 01:03:02,890
Since when do you have an agent?
And since when is it okay

1412
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:05,894
<i>to book Late Night without
the producer's approval?</i>

1413
01:03:05,895 --> 01:03:08,231
<i>Actually, it's Late Late.
It's two "lates".</i>

1414
01:03:08,232 --> 01:03:11,766
And since he became the hottest
personality on morning TV.

1415
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:13,252
Have you seen this guy's
ratings?

1416
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:16,572
Yes. Yes, I have.

1417
01:03:16,573 --> 01:03:18,359
Yeah, okay.
Anyways, you leave tonight.

1418
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,693
- Okay.
- It's all set.

1419
01:03:19,694 --> 01:03:21,762
- How cool is this?
- Come on, let's go.

1420
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,566
Aah! Oh, my God!

1421
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,173
Joy said
you wanted to see me?

1422
01:03:32,174 --> 01:03:35,194
I just found out that
Mike's being offered a job

1423
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:37,930
at a CBS affiliate in
San Francisco at twice the pay.

1424
01:03:37,931 --> 01:03:40,232
Craig Ferguson
is his audition.

1425
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,103
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, I'm serious.

1426
01:03:43,104 --> 01:03:45,305
If Bob and Harold find out
about this, we're dead.

1427
01:03:45,306 --> 01:03:48,174
Now, I need you to fly out there
and talk him out of it.

1428
01:03:48,175 --> 01:03:49,876
I'm going to Lake Tahoe
this weekend.

1429
01:03:49,877 --> 01:03:52,279
Just don't let him know
that you know beforehand.

1430
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,132
Go ahead and let him do the
show, and get us our publicity,

1431
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:57,936
and then convince him
that he needs to sign on with us

1432
01:03:57,937 --> 01:04:01,990
for the next three years.
That's all we can do.

1433
01:04:11,052 --> 01:04:12,635
Stuart, I'm pulling up.

1434
01:04:12,636 --> 01:04:14,404
I'm gonna try to catch him
before he goes.

1435
01:04:14,405 --> 01:04:16,439
Okay. I'll call you back.

1436
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:19,710
Thank you.

1437
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,413
Hello,
little stupid penis face.

1438
01:04:22,414 --> 01:04:24,549
You'd be on cable access
if it weren't for me.

1439
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:25,884
Hear you wanna move to CBS.

1440
01:04:25,885 --> 01:04:28,653
Is everything okay, miss?

1441
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:32,324
Yes, I'm just...
I'm practicing my speech.

1442
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,361
Abby?
What are you doing here?

1443
01:04:35,362 --> 01:04:37,280
I thought you were
going to Tahoe.

1444
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:39,616
Oh. You couldn't spend a day
without me, could you?

1445
01:04:39,617 --> 01:04:43,070
Oh, yes. I just can't get enough
of your sparkling wit and charm.

1446
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:44,905
Stuart thought you needed
a producer more

1447
01:04:44,906 --> 01:04:46,456
than I needed to get laid.

1448
01:04:46,457 --> 01:04:48,859
So come on, I gotta check in.
We leave in five minutes.

1449
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:50,211
Wow.

1450
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:53,297
Five minutes.
Ticktock, ticktock.

1451
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:55,384
Yes, dear.

1452
01:04:55,385 --> 01:04:59,639
Okay, uh, so let's go over
the pre-interview questions.

1453
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,424
I'm sorry you didn't get
to spend time

1454
01:05:02,425 --> 01:05:03,992
with little Colin
this weekend.

1455
01:05:03,993 --> 01:05:06,328
And by "little,"
I don't mean undersized,

1456
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:08,982
although I highly suspect
that's the case.

1457
01:05:08,983 --> 01:05:12,420
Colin's penis. That's what
you wanna talk about right now?

1458
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:15,089
Because I thought maybe
we should talk about

1459
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:16,992
what you're gonna say
on the show.

1460
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:19,761
Yeah. Okay.

1461
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:23,165
<i>So tell me, Mike,
how did The Ugly Truth start?</i>

1462
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:25,400
Uh, well,
Mr. Irish Craig Ferguson,

1463
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:27,302
I had a sales job

1464
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:30,707
where I was driving around
a lot, listening to talk radio.

1465
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:32,258
I started calling in,

1466
01:05:32,259 --> 01:05:35,179
and then I realized
I'm smarter than everybody else.

1467
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,013
Just ask my producer, Abby.

1468
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:38,915
She thinks
I'm a genius on days

1469
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,551
when she's not
sexually frustrated.

1470
01:05:40,552 --> 01:05:42,386
Yes, thousands of lives

1471
01:05:42,387 --> 01:05:43,887
have been enriched
by your wisdom.

1472
01:05:43,888 --> 01:05:45,690
Excuse me, lady,

1473
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,825
but you have a boyfriend
right now because of me.

1474
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:49,327
It may have started
because of you,

1475
01:05:49,328 --> 01:05:50,629
but it's lasted because of me.

1476
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:51,930
Great.
So you're acting like

1477
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:53,999
your normal control-freak
psycho self again.

1478
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,701
I am not a control freak.

1479
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,588
When you checked
into the hotel,

1480
01:05:57,589 --> 01:06:00,139
did you or did you not
insist on getting

1481
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,493
an eastern-facing room
on a floor not below 7?

1482
01:06:04,645 --> 01:06:07,214
I like rising with the sun,
and a view.

1483
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:13,288
My point is, that Colin likes
the Mike version of Abby,

1484
01:06:13,289 --> 01:06:14,723
not the Abby version
of Abby.

1485
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:17,359
So don't go knocking
my words of wisdom

1486
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,529
when you're living proof
that they work.

1487
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,815
I could be
having sex right now.

1488
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:24,482
Right this way, please.

1489
01:06:24,483 --> 01:06:25,685
Dude, this is awesome.

1490
01:06:25,686 --> 01:06:28,921
You are about to go on
national television.

1491
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:30,724
Okay, this isn't helping,
Rick.

1492
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:33,293
Just, you know,
do what you always do.

1493
01:06:33,294 --> 01:06:35,062
What do I always do?

1494
01:06:35,063 --> 01:06:38,165
You, uh...
I don't know, you...

1495
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:41,035
You entertain millions of people
with your moronic ideas,

1496
01:06:41,036 --> 01:06:43,437
and they love you for it.

1497
01:06:43,438 --> 01:06:45,740
I think that may be the nicest
thing you ever said to me.

1498
01:06:45,741 --> 01:06:47,527
- You're welcome.
- Next up,

1499
01:06:47,528 --> 01:06:49,646
here to tell us the ugly truth
about men and women

1500
01:06:49,647 --> 01:06:52,281
is Mike Chadway, everybody.
Mike Chadway.

1501
01:06:54,435 --> 01:06:56,719
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1502
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,689
Come on up.

1503
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,492
Hey, how are you, folks?

1504
01:07:01,493 --> 01:07:03,777
FERGUSON:
All right, Mike, welcome.

1505
01:07:03,778 --> 01:07:07,598
Now, listen. Men, we men,
I think I can say "we men".

1506
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,169
Not necessarily "wee" men,
but men of all sizes...

1507
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,203
No, I get it. I get it.

1508
01:07:11,204 --> 01:07:13,371
We're not known for
our expertise

1509
01:07:13,372 --> 01:07:15,541
in matters of the heart.

1510
01:07:15,542 --> 01:07:19,528
But I hear you have some very
interesting ideas and theories.

1511
01:07:19,529 --> 01:07:22,281
What advice would you give
to the good people out there

1512
01:07:22,282 --> 01:07:24,184
that are
looking for love?

1513
01:07:24,185 --> 01:07:26,019
My advice would be, uh:

1514
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,472
Don't do it.

1515
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:30,407
I mean,
try to find lust instead.

1516
01:07:30,408 --> 01:07:33,728
It's a lot easier
and a lot less messy.

1517
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:35,229
Blue balls,
they only last a few hours,

1518
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,899
but a broken heart,
that can last years.

1519
01:07:42,888 --> 01:07:45,108
<i>Goodness me. Tell me, then.
What's her name?</i>

1520
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:47,760
<i>Who?</i>

1521
01:07:47,761 --> 01:07:51,564
<i>The woman that screwed
you up. She must have been a doozy.</i>

1522
01:07:56,671 --> 01:08:02,093
<i>Ah. Well, like I said,
better a floozy than a doozy.</i>

1523
01:08:06,466 --> 01:08:09,869
Hi. I was looking
for an Abby Richter.

1524
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,902
<i>Did you get him? Is he ours?</i>

1525
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:26,170
I'm working on it.

1526
01:08:26,171 --> 01:08:28,171
I gotta go.

1527
01:08:29,493 --> 01:08:32,026
- Where's Rick?
- I sent him home.

1528
01:08:32,027 --> 01:08:34,229
I thought maybe you and I
could celebrate on our own.

1529
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:36,348
Here. Give me some of that.

1530
01:08:36,349 --> 01:08:39,401
And, uh, what exactly
are we celebrating?

1531
01:08:39,402 --> 01:08:42,305
Hello? Craig Ferguson?
I was just on it.

1532
01:08:42,306 --> 01:08:44,474
I mean, maybe you saw it?

1533
01:08:45,393 --> 01:08:48,128
I heard about
the offer from CBS.

1534
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:52,116
Well, then maybe you heard
I turned it down.

1535
01:08:52,117 --> 01:08:54,018
You did?

1536
01:08:55,587 --> 01:08:56,988
Why?

1537
01:08:56,989 --> 01:08:59,173
Jonah.

1538
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:01,209
You know,
he needs me around.

1539
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:05,247
I may not be the best
father figure out there,

1540
01:09:05,248 --> 01:09:07,216
but I'm the only one he's got.

1541
01:09:07,217 --> 01:09:11,086
And I don't wanna half-ass it
all the way from San Francisco.

1542
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:14,725
Well, I think that's
a very good decision.

1543
01:09:14,726 --> 01:09:15,942
Thank you.

1544
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:18,078
Now, can we stop
talking about work

1545
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:23,185
and maybe relax
and drink, enjoy?

1546
01:09:23,186 --> 01:09:25,119
God.

1547
01:09:26,256 --> 01:09:27,773
Tell me about the doozy.

1548
01:09:27,774 --> 01:09:30,708
You know, the woman
who broke your heart.

1549
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:33,613
You are just totally
trying to kill my buzz.

1550
01:09:33,614 --> 01:09:36,731
No, I'm not. I'm just interested
in what makes you you.

1551
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:42,005
Well,
for your information,

1552
01:09:42,006 --> 01:09:45,642
it was, uh...
It was more than just one.

1553
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:49,713
It was more like a parade.

1554
01:09:49,714 --> 01:09:53,550
Co-dependent girls,
unfaithful girls,

1555
01:09:53,551 --> 01:09:55,087
depressed girls,

1556
01:09:55,088 --> 01:09:58,123
narcissistic girls,
phony girls.

1557
01:09:58,124 --> 01:10:02,094
Girls who, it turned out,
didn't actually like me.

1558
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:06,232
By the time I hit 30,
I realized that, uh,

1559
01:10:06,233 --> 01:10:08,168
you can only have
so many lousy relationships

1560
01:10:08,169 --> 01:10:09,302
before you figure out

1561
01:10:09,303 --> 01:10:10,903
there's no such thing
as a good one.

1562
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:13,390
Oh, come on. You can't really
believe there's no such thing

1563
01:10:13,391 --> 01:10:15,293
as a good relationship.

1564
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,563
Mm. To my very core.

1565
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,016
Hello. Can I
get you something?

1566
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,119
I'll have one of those, please.
A mojito. Sure.

1567
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,621
Would you like anything else?
Yeah, some water.

1568
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:29,192
Okay, would you like
still or sparkling?

1569
01:10:29,193 --> 01:10:32,027
- Tap water's great. Thanks.
- Tap. All right.

1570
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:34,315
What?

1571
01:10:34,316 --> 01:10:36,484
What?

1572
01:10:36,485 --> 01:10:38,969
It's the exact same thing,
isn't it?

1573
01:10:40,656 --> 01:10:43,824
So I've been told.

1574
01:10:45,795 --> 01:10:47,695
Come on, let's dance.

1575
01:10:47,696 --> 01:10:50,131
No, I'm serious.

1576
01:10:50,132 --> 01:10:53,169
I've seen your spazzy dance,
now I wanna see the real thing.

1577
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,304
No, really.
I can't dance like that.

1578
01:10:55,305 --> 01:10:57,124
I can. Well, kind of.

1579
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:03,597
Ugh. Mike, no.

1580
01:11:03,598 --> 01:11:05,865
No.

1581
01:11:21,535 --> 01:11:23,602
<i>¶ The way you walk

1582
01:11:23,603 --> 01:11:25,772

1597
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:40,188
We have an early flight
tomorrow. We should go.

1598
01:12:44,428 --> 01:12:46,963
Yeah. We should go.

1599
01:13:16,296 --> 01:13:20,234
So the car is gonna pick us
up downstairs tomorrow at 8.

1600
01:13:20,235 --> 01:13:23,403
Do you want me to call you?
No, I'll get a wake-up call.

1601
01:13:23,404 --> 01:13:25,539
- Oh, yeah, good idea.
- Yeah.

1602
01:13:28,877 --> 01:13:30,312
I had a really good time
tonight.

1603
01:13:30,313 --> 01:13:32,347
Me too.

1604
01:13:32,348 --> 01:13:34,181
Yeah.

1605
01:13:42,059 --> 01:13:44,060
- My floor.
- Yeah.

1606
01:13:44,061 --> 01:13:46,329
- See you tomorrow.
- Eight o'clock.

1607
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,566
Eight o'clock.

1608
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:51,101
- Good night.
- Good night. Oh!

1609
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:55,605
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

1610
01:13:58,078 --> 01:14:00,078
- A lot of fun. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

1611
01:14:16,514 --> 01:14:17,898
I guess, uh,

1612
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:20,468
I guess I should go, huh?

1613
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:22,970
Yeah.

1614
01:14:22,971 --> 01:14:25,473
Good night.

1615
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:50,985
What the hell was that?

1616
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:54,021
Why do I wanna do it again?

1617
01:15:06,622 --> 01:15:08,288
- Miss me?
- Colin.

1618
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:09,906
You were expecting
someone else?

1619
01:15:09,907 --> 01:15:11,408
No.

1620
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:12,843
- Mm.
- Uh...

1621
01:15:12,844 --> 01:15:14,662
Since you couldn't
come to Lake Tahoe,

1622
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:16,813
I decided to come to you.

1623
01:15:16,814 --> 01:15:19,400
Oh. How did you
know I was here?

1624
01:15:19,401 --> 01:15:20,535
Uh, Joy told me.

1625
01:15:20,536 --> 01:15:21,886
I just started
thinking about

1626
01:15:21,887 --> 01:15:24,240
all the stuff we were
going to do there, and I...

1627
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:28,159
- Come here.
- decided I couldn't wait.

1628
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,595
- A little champagne?
- Yeah.

1629
01:15:29,596 --> 01:15:31,764
Great.

1630
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:34,568
- So happy to be here.
- Oh, yes.

1631
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:36,553
What's wrong?

1632
01:15:36,554 --> 01:15:39,190
Nothing.
You just surprised me.

1633
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:40,975
You told me you were
spontaneous.

1634
01:15:40,976 --> 01:15:42,527
Yes, I did.

1635
01:15:42,528 --> 01:15:44,961
Have a little something else
on its way up for you.

1636
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:46,797
You are going to love it.

1637
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:49,817
- Oh! Whoa! Ha-ha!
- Whoa!

1638
01:15:49,818 --> 01:15:52,154
Let me tell you,
it comes out so fast, right?

1639
01:15:52,155 --> 01:15:55,842
Oh, wow, I guess we'll have to
get naked sooner than I thought.

1640
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,527
- I'll get you a towel.
- Okay.

1641
01:16:08,907 --> 01:16:10,942
Abby, I...

1642
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:16,882
Abby, I really,
really wanna do that again,

1643
01:16:16,883 --> 01:16:18,383
and not just tonight.

1644
01:16:18,384 --> 01:16:20,119
Fuck!

1645
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,788
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1646
01:16:22,789 --> 01:16:26,658
Man up, Chadway.
Come on, you can do this.

1647
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:37,155
Hey, hey.
You're not room service.

1648
01:16:37,156 --> 01:16:39,591
- How you doing, man?
- Hey. Uh...

1649
01:16:39,592 --> 01:16:42,210
Hey. Good to see you.
I, uh...

1650
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:45,997
I just came by to tell
Abby about the change

1651
01:16:45,998 --> 01:16:47,850
in our flight time,

1652
01:16:47,851 --> 01:16:50,870
but I can come by later.

1653
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:52,272
Hi.

1654
01:16:52,273 --> 01:16:53,657
Hey.

1655
01:16:53,658 --> 01:16:55,859
What are you doing here?

1656
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,728
Uh, flight's changed.

1657
01:16:57,729 --> 01:17:01,165
Eight o'clock in the morning.

1658
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:03,884
I... I told you that already?

1659
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:08,957
Uh, I'm so...
Long day, big day.

1660
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,643
Okay, I'll just leave now.

1661
01:17:20,186 --> 01:17:21,688
Mike. Mike.

1662
01:17:21,689 --> 01:17:23,873
Hey, wait.

1663
01:17:25,659 --> 01:17:27,862
He came to surprise me. I...

1664
01:17:27,863 --> 01:17:30,315
Hey, how convenient.

1665
01:17:30,316 --> 01:17:31,832
No, I...

1666
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:34,069
I thought it was you
at the door.

1667
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:36,320
Well, I guess we're all
interchangeable.

1668
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:40,209
I taught you well.

1669
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,510
Hey, maybe you could
even host the show.

1670
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,441
Tell me what happened
in the elevator.

1671
01:17:54,442 --> 01:17:56,810
Should I tell Colin to go?

1672
01:17:58,013 --> 01:17:59,546
No.

1673
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:03,318
No, why pull up anchor now?

1674
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:06,404
I mean, you worked damn hard
to get him here.

1675
01:18:08,008 --> 01:18:12,077
And that's it?
That's all you have to say?

1676
01:18:13,214 --> 01:18:15,382
What do you want me to say?

1677
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,336
The truth is ugly, isn't it?

1678
01:18:20,688 --> 01:18:22,756
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1679
01:18:22,757 --> 01:18:24,892
Hm.

1680
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:29,047
I'll see you.

1681
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:57,662
Sorry about that.

1682
01:18:57,663 --> 01:19:00,932
No. Honestly, no worries.

1683
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:02,466
Just come here.

1684
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:07,006
Listen, the rest
of the night is ours. Hm?

1685
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:11,495
To the first of many
romantic evenings to come.

1686
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:16,934
Whoa. Uh...

1687
01:19:16,935 --> 01:19:18,418
Okay.

1688
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,924
Mm. Yeah.

1689
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,227
Colin, why do you like me?

1690
01:19:27,431 --> 01:19:29,998
Oh, heh.

1691
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,065
Wow. Uh...

1692
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:33,736
You're beautiful.

1693
01:19:33,737 --> 01:19:35,254
You're smart.

1694
01:19:35,255 --> 01:19:37,006
You, uh...

1695
01:19:37,007 --> 01:19:39,042
You never criticize.

1696
01:19:39,043 --> 01:19:41,694
You know what? You never
try to control the situation.

1697
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:44,899
And I've gotta say,
it's a breath of fresh air

1698
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,136
because I know so many women
who are total control freaks,

1699
01:19:48,137 --> 01:19:49,188
and it's a nightmare.

1700
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:51,439
And I just love that
you're not like that.

1701
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,690
But I am.

1702
01:19:52,691 --> 01:19:54,993
I am just like that.

1703
01:19:54,994 --> 01:19:57,029
Wait, what do you mean?

1704
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:59,482
Well, this should be chilled.

1705
01:19:59,483 --> 01:20:01,234
And you know that.

1706
01:20:01,235 --> 01:20:04,053
And, uh,
as horrible as it sounds,

1707
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:05,922
I was editing that speech

1708
01:20:05,923 --> 01:20:07,492
the entire time
you were giving it.

1709
01:20:07,493 --> 01:20:10,059
And the time you fed me caviar,

1710
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,747
I was in physical pain.

1711
01:20:12,748 --> 01:20:15,466
I hate being fed
like a toddler.

1712
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:17,886
That's how much
of a control freak I am.

1713
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:21,056
But I couldn't show you
any of that, because

1714
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:23,826
who would love
someone like that?

1715
01:20:23,827 --> 01:20:25,561
No one.

1716
01:20:30,734 --> 01:20:31,834
Um...

1717
01:20:42,932 --> 01:20:45,366
I'm so sorry.

1718
01:20:45,367 --> 01:20:48,503
You are a great guy,
you really are.

1719
01:20:48,504 --> 01:20:53,075
Which is why I have to tell you
that I have not been myself.

1720
01:20:53,076 --> 01:20:56,012
Not for one second of the time
that we've been dating.

1721
01:20:56,013 --> 01:20:59,015
Then who have you been?

1722
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:04,055
The girl some idiot
told me to be.

1723
01:21:30,868 --> 01:21:33,103
Morning, Freddy.

1724
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:36,273
What did you do to him?

1725
01:21:36,274 --> 01:21:37,342
I didn't do anything.

1726
01:21:37,343 --> 01:21:39,010
He missed the flight
all on his own.

1727
01:21:39,011 --> 01:21:41,396
He quit this morning.

1728
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,748
I just got a smug call
from the local CBS affiliate

1729
01:21:43,749 --> 01:21:45,350
saying they'd closed
a deal with him.

1730
01:21:45,351 --> 01:21:48,003
Corporate's having a shit fit.
What the hell happened?

1731
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:51,290
He quit to go to one
of our local competitors?

1732
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,494
We don't need Mike Chadway.

1733
01:21:54,495 --> 01:21:56,863
Halfwit troglodytes
are a dime a dozen.

1734
01:21:56,864 --> 01:21:58,097
You'd better be right.

1735
01:21:58,098 --> 01:21:59,101
Because you gotta find me
another one

1736
01:21:59,102 --> 01:22:01,369
by the end of the week
or else we're cancelled.

1737
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:04,037
I'll find one
by the end of the day.

1738
01:22:04,038 --> 01:22:07,709
Not really. I'm just...
That's just a joke, everybody.

1739
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:10,161
I can't believe I allowed myself
to feel anything for him.

1740
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:12,480
Well, you felt enough something
to break up with Colin.

1741
01:22:12,481 --> 01:22:14,100
I'm sorry.

1742
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:16,270
Okay, here are the
Mike Chadway replacements.

1743
01:22:16,271 --> 01:22:18,371
Yes, no, yes, no, no,

1744
01:22:18,372 --> 01:22:20,640
fuck no.
"Fuck no". All right.

1745
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:23,760
So, what do you think
of the new set?

1746
01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:25,461
I love it.

1747
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:29,000
KSXP retained the copyright
to your old segment title,

1748
01:22:29,001 --> 01:22:33,305
<i>so we retitled you:
Morning Madness With Mike.</i>

1749
01:22:34,674 --> 01:22:35,874
Love it.

1750
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:38,076
And this is Joe,
your new producer.

1751
01:22:38,077 --> 01:22:39,911
Hi.

1752
01:22:41,347 --> 01:22:43,749
You know what I like
best about you, Joe?

1753
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,285
Is I don't wanna
have sex with you at all.

1754
01:22:46,286 --> 01:22:48,154
I'm relieved
to hear that.

1755
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:55,997
<i>¶ Givin' myself to you is like
Givin' myself to chainsaw ¶</i>

1756
01:22:55,998 --> 01:22:57,899
<i>¶ You keep cuttin' me open
Why? ¶</i>

1757
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:01,334
<i>¶ Is that the only thing
That you're good for? ¶</i>

1758
01:23:01,335 --> 01:23:05,907
<i>¶ Givin' myself to you is like
Givin' myself to a chainsaw ¶</i>

1759
01:23:05,908 --> 01:23:08,177
<i>¶ You keep cuttin' me open
Why? ¶</i>

1760
01:23:08,178 --> 01:23:10,679
<i>¶ Is that the only thing
That you're good for? ¶</i>

1761
01:23:17,388 --> 01:23:20,741
How's my face?
Is it too shiny?

1762
01:23:20,742 --> 01:23:24,763
Which side is better?
Right, left, full frontal?

1763
01:23:24,764 --> 01:23:26,598
They're all great.

1764
01:23:26,599 --> 01:23:28,833
Can we go over your intro
one more time?

1765
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:31,604
"I'm Jack Magnum,
and this is.. ".

1766
01:23:31,605 --> 01:23:34,672
<i>The Ugly Truth.</i>

1767
01:23:35,976 --> 01:23:39,111
Okay. Let's, uh,
maybe lose the gun thing.

1768
01:23:39,112 --> 01:23:41,815
What? Gun's my signature move.

1769
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:43,850
Unless the NRA is paying
your mortgage this month,

1770
01:23:43,851 --> 01:23:45,485
I say lose
the effing gun.

1771
01:23:45,486 --> 01:23:49,340
All right, we're live
in five, four, three...

1772
01:23:49,341 --> 01:23:51,209
Two, one.

1773
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,878
Think this guy's any good?

1774
01:23:52,879 --> 01:23:54,496
He better be.

1775
01:23:54,497 --> 01:23:59,217
<i>I'm Jack Magnum,
and this is The Ugly Truth.</i>

1776
01:23:59,218 --> 01:24:01,036
<i>Peace.</i>

1777
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:02,888
Oh, Jesus.
He's going political.

1778
01:24:02,889 --> 01:24:05,291
Okay, so we'll do a couple
questions with the balloon pilot

1779
01:24:05,292 --> 01:24:07,160
about how often
couples get it on

1780
01:24:07,161 --> 01:24:08,661
in-flight,
and then we're out.

1781
01:24:08,662 --> 01:24:11,132
Got it.

1782
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:12,933
Check it out.
Your replacement's on.

1783
01:24:12,934 --> 01:24:14,667
<i>GEORGIA:... Jack Magnum.
My what?</i>

1784
01:24:14,668 --> 01:24:17,204
<i>How's it going out there?
Your replacement?</i>

1785
01:24:17,205 --> 01:24:19,073
<i>Most of you
are watching this show</i>

1786
01:24:19,074 --> 01:24:20,741
<i>so you can learn how
to get chicks.</i>

1787
01:24:20,742 --> 01:24:24,346
<i>Well, let me assure you,
you're in good hands.</i>

1788
01:24:24,347 --> 01:24:26,498
<i>You're looking at a guy</i>

1789
01:24:26,499 --> 01:24:30,870
who personally has had sex
with over 137 women.

1790
01:24:30,871 --> 01:24:32,339
Most of them conscious.

1791
01:24:34,024 --> 01:24:36,209
This is beautiful.

1792
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,928
Now, we're here
at the balloon festival

1793
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:39,730
and I'm supposed
to be telling you about

1794
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:41,030
how men are full of hot air.

1795
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:42,633
But I think we all know,

1796
01:24:42,634 --> 01:24:44,469
it's the ladies
that are full of crap.

1797
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:48,523
Just because she says no,
doesn't mean she means no.

1798
01:24:48,524 --> 01:24:50,810
<i>If that were the case,</i>

1799
01:24:50,811 --> 01:24:52,226
I'd have only 90 women...

1800
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:55,197
Okay. All right.

1801
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:56,565
What the hell?

1802
01:24:56,566 --> 01:24:58,567
Did she...? Oh.

1803
01:24:58,568 --> 01:24:59,985
- Uh...
- Welcome back.

1804
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:03,690
It looks like we're experiencing
some technical difficulty.

1805
01:25:03,691 --> 01:25:06,661
Yeah, when you have
a wine festival...

1806
01:25:06,662 --> 01:25:08,729
Okay, I got it.

1807
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:10,331
Unh. Hi.

1808
01:25:10,332 --> 01:25:11,665
- Uh...
- We're back.

1809
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,501
I'm sorry,

1810
01:25:13,502 --> 01:25:17,956
<i>but Jack Magnum will no longer
be able to do The Ugly Truth.</i>

1811
01:25:17,957 --> 01:25:20,158
Which should really
come as no surprise

1812
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,930
because men
are completely unreliable.

1813
01:25:23,931 --> 01:25:26,198
What is she doing?

1814
01:25:26,199 --> 01:25:29,569
Yes? Yes, Harold? Yes. Yes,
I know. We're fixing it.

1815
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:31,170
<i>Take Mike Chadway,
for instance.</i>

1816
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:34,407
<i>He up and quit the show
without so much as a word.</i>

1817
01:25:34,408 --> 01:25:36,610
<i>You think you know what men
are gonna do,</i>

1818
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:38,845
<i>you think you know
what men want to do.</i>

1819
01:25:38,846 --> 01:25:40,781
<i>But when it comes right down
to that moment</i>

1820
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:42,450
<i>where they actually need
to step up</i>

1821
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:44,569
<i>and, I don't know,
make a move,</i>

1822
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:46,205
<i>they chicken out.</i>

1823
01:25:46,206 --> 01:25:48,890
Oh. I am all over this.

1824
01:25:48,891 --> 01:25:51,343
Where're you going?
We're live in two!

1825
01:25:51,344 --> 01:25:52,545
It's going great, isn't it?

1826
01:25:52,546 --> 01:25:55,097
The big, strong, brave men

1827
01:25:55,098 --> 01:25:56,598
that we've all been
reading about

1828
01:25:56,599 --> 01:25:59,169
in novels and watching in movies
since we were 9 years old,

1829
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:01,704
that's a fallacy.
They don't exist.

1830
01:26:01,705 --> 01:26:05,443
Men are not strong.
Men are not brave.

1831
01:26:05,444 --> 01:26:07,228
Men are afraid.

1832
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:08,662
It's all part of the show.

1833
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,681
Sort of an Andy Kaufman
thing we're doing.

1834
01:26:10,682 --> 01:26:16,455
Even if they have a moment
in a hotel elevator, and...

1835
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:20,210
<i>and it's totally romantic
and full of potential,</i>

1836
01:26:20,211 --> 01:26:23,863
men are incapable
of copping to it.

1837
01:26:23,864 --> 01:26:26,083
Because why?

1838
01:26:26,084 --> 01:26:27,567
Men are weak.

1839
01:26:27,568 --> 01:26:31,272
Let me tell you something
about women.

1840
01:26:31,273 --> 01:26:32,773
Oh. Hey.

1841
01:26:32,774 --> 01:26:36,577
Woman would have us believe
that they are the victims.

1842
01:26:36,578 --> 01:26:38,746
That we break
their hearts for sport.

1843
01:26:38,747 --> 01:26:40,432
<i>I thought he quit.
That's crap.</i>

1844
01:26:40,433 --> 01:26:42,819
See, Bob?
I told you we'd get him back.

1845
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,387
They say they want true love,

1846
01:26:44,388 --> 01:26:46,721
but all they want
is a checklist.

1847
01:26:46,722 --> 01:26:50,944
Is he perfect? Is he handsome?
Is he a doctor?

1848
01:26:50,945 --> 01:26:52,578
<i>For you men who fit
the criteria,</i>

1849
01:26:52,579 --> 01:26:55,532
<i>don't kid yourselves,
they're not sleeping with you.</i>

1850
01:26:55,533 --> 01:26:58,452
They're sleeping with
a carefully calculated

1851
01:26:58,453 --> 01:27:00,455
set of venal choices.

1852
01:27:00,456 --> 01:27:03,558
Money over substance,
looks over soul.

1853
01:27:03,559 --> 01:27:05,560
Polish over principles.

1854
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:08,596
No gesture,
no matter how real or romantic,

1855
01:27:08,597 --> 01:27:10,131
will ever compensate

1856
01:27:10,132 --> 01:27:12,601
for a really impressive list
of credentials.

1857
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:15,304
This coming from a man
who's never made a gesture

1858
01:27:15,305 --> 01:27:16,806
other than this one.

1859
01:27:16,807 --> 01:27:18,976
Oh, so the elevator
wasn't a gesture?

1860
01:27:18,977 --> 01:27:20,994
The elevator
was a moment of passion,

1861
01:27:20,995 --> 01:27:24,281
followed by a moment of panic
on your part, apparently.

1862
01:27:24,282 --> 01:27:27,030
- Panic? I came by your room.
- Yes...

1863
01:27:27,031 --> 01:27:28,936
and then you ran away.

1864
01:27:28,937 --> 01:27:30,642
That wasn't panic,
sweetheart.

1865
01:27:30,643 --> 01:27:32,556
That was
an unwillingness to compete

1866
01:27:32,557 --> 01:27:35,494
with the walking checklist
that was in your bed.

1867
01:27:35,495 --> 01:27:36,829
You should be thanking me.

1868
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:38,130
Uh, we got 10 seconds.

1869
01:27:38,131 --> 01:27:41,384
Are we ready to soar
up, up and away?

1870
01:27:41,385 --> 01:27:44,286
Well, there you have it, folks.
That's the ugly truth.

1871
01:27:44,287 --> 01:27:46,122
A girl in heat for two guys

1872
01:27:46,123 --> 01:27:48,458
will always choose the one
with the better résumé.

1873
01:27:48,459 --> 01:27:50,225
That is bullsh...

1874
01:27:51,429 --> 01:27:54,332
And we're out.

1875
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:57,342
God. I hate you so much,
I just swore on live television.

1876
01:27:57,343 --> 01:28:00,623
No, you hate yourself
for being so shallow.

1877
01:28:00,624 --> 01:28:02,457
- Off we go.
- Where're we going?

1878
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:04,276
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

1879
01:28:04,277 --> 01:28:06,445
Whoa.

1880
01:28:06,446 --> 01:28:09,514
Oh. Well, that's a shocker,
you're bailing.

1881
01:28:09,515 --> 01:28:10,900
I wouldn't recommend that.

1882
01:28:10,901 --> 01:28:13,453
Keep rolling
on the onboard camera.

1883
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:20,377
<i>What're you doing?
God, what is wrong with you?</i>

1884
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,101
They don't even know
they're on the air, do they?

1885
01:28:26,102 --> 01:28:27,469
Uh-uh.

1886
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,471
Is there any way to tell them
they're on the air?

1887
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:30,906
Nope.

1888
01:28:30,907 --> 01:28:32,975
Oh, they're gonna curse.
I know it.

1889
01:28:45,923 --> 01:28:48,625
So who
wants champagne?

1890
01:28:49,627 --> 01:28:51,662
Oh, I know.
I got a great idea.

1891
01:28:51,663 --> 01:28:54,166
Why don't we pass the time
with you telling me

1892
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:57,235
how much fun you and Colin had
having sex in Los Angeles?

1893
01:28:57,236 --> 01:28:59,905
I broke up with Colin
in Los Angeles, you jackass.

1894
01:28:59,906 --> 01:29:02,140
On our left, you'll see
the High Sierras...

1895
01:29:02,141 --> 01:29:03,592
What?

1896
01:29:03,593 --> 01:29:05,478
Oh, yeah.
That's got your interest.

1897
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:07,981
Well, if you think we're gonna
finish what we started in LA,

1898
01:29:07,982 --> 01:29:10,401
you're out of your mind.
You lost your chance.

1899
01:29:10,402 --> 01:29:12,669
Oh, come on.
I never had a chance with you.

1900
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:16,007
And to our right here, you'll
see the lovely Sacramento River

1901
01:29:16,008 --> 01:29:18,709
winding its way through
the dichromatic landscape.

1902
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,944
Could you please stop talking?
Thank you.

1903
01:29:20,945 --> 01:29:23,364
You're right. I had a momentary
lapse in judgment

1904
01:29:23,365 --> 01:29:25,750
when I thought you were more
than you are, but you aren't.

1905
01:29:25,751 --> 01:29:26,819
Clearly.

1906
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,755
Oh, yeah?
Well, what does that mean?

1907
01:29:28,756 --> 01:29:30,706
"I'm Mike Chadway.
I like girls in Jell-O.

1908
01:29:30,707 --> 01:29:34,094
I like to fuck like a monkey.
Don't fall in love, it's scary".

1909
01:29:34,095 --> 01:29:36,812
Oh, for God's sakes,
there's the first one.

1910
01:29:38,232 --> 01:29:40,967
Yeah, it is scary.
It's terrifying.

1911
01:29:40,968 --> 01:29:43,771
Especially when I'm in love
with a psycho like you.

1912
01:29:43,772 --> 01:29:45,106
<i>I am not a psycho.</i>

1913
01:29:45,107 --> 01:29:47,025
Love?

1914
01:29:47,026 --> 01:29:48,393
Oh!

1915
01:29:48,394 --> 01:29:49,794
I just told you
that I loved you,

1916
01:29:49,795 --> 01:29:51,796
and all you heard was "psycho".

1917
01:29:51,797 --> 01:29:53,565
You're the definition
of neurotic.

1918
01:29:53,566 --> 01:29:54,883
No.
The definition of neurotic

1919
01:29:54,884 --> 01:29:57,469
is a person who suffers from
anxiety, obsessive thoughts,

1920
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:59,404
compulsive acts
and physical ailments

1921
01:29:59,405 --> 01:30:01,040
without any objective
evidence of...

1922
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:02,758
Shut up.

1923
01:30:02,759 --> 01:30:05,061
Yet again, I just told
you I'm in love with you,

1924
01:30:05,062 --> 01:30:07,999
and you're standing here
giving me a vocabulary lesson.

1925
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:22,330
You're in love with me.

1926
01:30:22,331 --> 01:30:24,500
Why?

1927
01:30:26,937 --> 01:30:29,021
Beats the shit outta me,

1928
01:30:29,022 --> 01:30:31,124
but I am.

1929
01:30:58,022 --> 01:30:59,956
Oh! Oh, Mike.

1930
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:03,861
- You're amazing.
- Ah, I am?

1931
01:31:03,862 --> 01:31:06,514
Oh, you're a god. Oh!

1932
01:31:06,515 --> 01:31:08,716
- Really?
- Oh, God!

1933
01:31:19,029 --> 01:31:20,447
Am I really that good?

1934
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,365
Or are you...?

1935
01:31:22,366 --> 01:31:24,050
Are you just faking it?

1936
01:31:26,187 --> 01:31:28,422
You'll never know.

1937
01:31:31,241 --> 01:31:34,978
