你知道吗?
Are you alert?

2
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:16,641
好,告诉他们…
Okay, well tell them....

3
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,276
不
No.

4
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,842
我过15分就到,别吵了
l'll be there in about 1 5 minutes,

-早,佛雷
-早,艾比
-Morning, Freddy.
-Morning, Abby.

8
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:42,029
-你今天美呆了
-里面情况有这么糟吗?
-You look awfully pretty today.
-Oh, is it that bad in there?

9
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,169
-早安
-早,有麻烦了
-Good morning. We got problems.
-Morning.

10
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,361
世上没有麻烦,只有解决的办法
There are no problems, Joy,
only solutions.

11
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,031
交通摄影机坏了,报路况没影像
The traffic camera is down and we
have no B-roll for our traffic segment.

12
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,437
-这下有麻烦了
-对
-That is a problem.
-Yeah.

13
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,771
找媒体实验室的迈特
他有空拍器,他欠我的
Call Matt at Media Lab.
He's got some Skycams.

14
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,948
-我的气象猛男呢?
-都在这里
-Where are all my weathermen?
-Right here.

15
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,275
-嗨
-哈罗
-Hey.
-Hello.

16
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,645
谢谢你们来
你们真赞
Thank you all for coming.
You guys look great.

17
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,445
谢谢你们来此
Thanks for being here. Good.

18
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,554
为什么他们怎么都这么大只?
ls there a reason
they're all overweight?

19
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,348
如果气象播报有误
lf they get the forecast wrong...

20
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,527
研究显示观众比较会原谅胖子
...research shows people
are more willing to forgive a fat guy.

21
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,196
艾比?我不想这么对你
不过我真的无法跟她共事下去了
l hate to do this.
l don't think l can work with her.

22
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,865
在家被她念就够了
在播报台也要
lt's bad enough
l have to take her criticism at home.

23
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,901
-男人不该永无止境的隐忍
-赖瑞,你不是男人
-A man can only endure so much.
-Larry, you are not a man...

24
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,731
你是新闻人
...you are a newsman.

25
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,998
新闻人不是养尊处优的
Newsmen are not defined
by the easy times...

26
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,301
新闻人是历经磨难的
...they're defined by the hard times.

27
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,979
你能想像
盛逐如、李似端
Can you imagine
Ted Koppel or Tom Brokaw...

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,512
跟他们老婆一起报新闻吗?
不行
...working with their
wives as co-anchors? No.

29
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,240
因为他们根本搞不定
Because they couldn't handle it.

30
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,477
可是朋友,你跨下有雄伟巨蛋
But you. You, my friend,
have balls the size of Volkswagens.

31
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:39,089
-别以为我没注意到
-它们最近有点累
-Don't think l haven't noticed.
-l only thought of them as blue of late.

32
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,226
不过它们是很雄伟
But you're right.
They're quite sizable.

33
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,885
又匀称
我觉得它们根本就是很帅气
But not disproportionately so. l think
of them as aesthetically pleasing.

34
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,690
我就说嘛
Yeah, l think l made my point.

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,368
你这是在耍我吗?
沙加缅度的人才不关心…
Are you kidding me right now?
Nobody in Sacramento...

根本没新闻价值

of the Brazilian slug worm.

00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,939
不过有哪个名媛被送勒戒就呛了
Knowing which celebutante
is in rehab is of vital importance?

38
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,043
-你的声音让我毛骨悚然
-他想杀我
-Your voice makes my hair--
-Okay. He is trying to kill me.

39
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,440
-他知道我对螃蟹过敏
-那是炸蟹角
-He knows l can't eat crab.
-lt's Crab Rangoon.

40
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,015
-谁不爱吃炸蟹角?
-妈呀,你看到没?
-Who doesn't eat Crab Rangoon?
-Oh, my God. Does anybody see this?

41
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,448
-这是蜂窝组织炎吗?
-我觉得像梅毒
-ls that a hive?
-No, looks like syphilis to me.

42
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,613
要不是我对名人大杂交的报导
你根本不知道梅毒长什么样子
You wouldn't even know what syphilis
looks like if it weren't for my story.

43
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,693
-三号机准备
-是的…
-Stand by to go to three.
-Yeah, so some--

义式烩鸡要放蘑菇大蒜
Cacciatore gets mushrooms, garlic.
Exactly.

45
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,133
-把蘑菇放进去
-好
-Yeah. Put the mushrooms in.
-All right.

46
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,131
不管你要放多少大蒜都行
And whatever amount
of garlic you want.

47
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,133
-大蒜永远不嫌多
-是吗?
-Really?
-You can't have enough garlic.

48
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,930
-是啊
-当然罗
-Oh, you can.
-l certainly can.

49
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,608
-我每晚都嗑大蒜
-我帮你弄了一大匙
-Do it every night.
-I got a nice, big spoon for you.

50
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,039
-真棒,谢谢
-来吧
-Oh, excellent. Thank you.
-Here you go.

51
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,541
-好吃吗?
-这是我…
-That good?
-l have to say, Rocco...

52
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,377
吃过最棒的义式烩鸡
...this is the best chicken cacciatore
l've ever tasted.

53
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,077
我就知道你喜欢,不过这是烩鸭
l knew you'd like it.
lt's duck cacciatore, actually.

54
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,256
-惨了
-他刚刚是说鸭子吗?
-Oh, no.
-Did he just say ''duck''?

55
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,156
用这来取代鸡很不错
And it's a great alternative
to chicken.

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,419
尝起来跟鸡肉没两样
lt kind of tastes
just like chicken, right?

57
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,096
鸭子,呱呱叫的鸭子?
Duck, like ''quack, quack'' duck?

58
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,128
-好,准备提前进广告
-好
-Get ready to roll to break.
-Yeah.

59
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,322
-鸭子耶
-对
-Whoa, duck.
-Yeah.

60
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,228
我们是鸡肉一族
Man, we're a chicken household.

61
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,563
-是啊
-叫赖瑞把话题…
-We are.
-Tell Larry to throw it to Javier...

62
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,604
-转给气象男
-应该没关系吧?
-...while she pulls it together.
-Or is it okay?

63
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,106
-很不错
-气象男,你喜欢吗?
-It's good.
-Javier, do you like it?

64
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,678
我能不能打包带回家?
Can l take home the leftovers?

65
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,278
-你不要打包带回家吗?
-稍后…
-You sure you don't want any leftovers?
-When we return...

66
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,577
-有空拍交通现况报导
-好
-...our live Skycam traffic update.
-Okay.

67
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,981
还有,猜猜这周谁进了勒戒所?
And guess who's in rehab this week.

68
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,623
-准备进广告
-稍后报导…
-Stand by to roll break.
-Also, how you can adopt...

69
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,952
如何下载个性小游戏
...your very own slug worm,
when we come back.

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,493
-进广告
-加盐会不会更好吃?试试看
-Roll your break.
-How about salt? Salt make it better?

71
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,298
你真行
l don't know how you do it.

72
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,532
掌握状况,直接斩断乱源就好
lt's just a matter of looking chaos
right in the eye and telling it to eff off.

73
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,172
你们做得很好,谢了
You guys did great. Thank you.

74
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,842
我想我们该换新的总m师了
l think it's time for a new chef
on this show. l do.

75
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,635
拜托,老骆是老搭档了
Now, come on.
Rocco's been with us--

76
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,142
-艾比?
-这道菜有那么烂吗?
-Abby?
-lt's this upsetting?

77
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,610
老大要见你,他很不爽
Hey, Stuart wants to see you.
He's freaking out.

78
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,613
他看到收视率了
Oh, he got the ratings.

79
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,014
-来一点吧?
-好,给我
-Want some?
-Yeah, give me that.

80
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,387
你看过昨天的收视率了?
Have you seen the ratings
from yesterday?

81
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,360
连无线台的节目都赢过我们
连重播的《包青天》都赢我们
We got beat by all the network shows,
including a rerun of Who's the Boss?

82
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,056
还是审乌盆那一集
The one where the vacuum breaks.

83
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,237
这只是暂时的,明天就会好转
lt's just a temporary setback.
Things will be better tomorrow.

84
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,838
公共电视的老人节目
You know that guy
with the cable-access show...

85
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,135
也赢我们
...on Channel 83 does better.

86
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,505
要是我们重播《蓝色蜘蛛网》
lf we program
Jerry Springer reruns...

87
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,045
可能还有得拼
...we'd do a nine-share
at a quarter of the price.

88
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,218
你不是想砍掉我的节目吧
Please don't tell me
you're thinking of killing the show.

89
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,819
我们已经不是家族电视台了
We're not a family-run station
anymore, Abby.

90
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,251
我爱你,你很行
l mean, l love you.
You're great at what you do.

91
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,357
不过你得给我一些数字
But you gotta get me some numbers.

92
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,323
我两个女儿念大学,儿子学美发
l got two daughters in college
and a son in beauty school.

93
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,989
我不知你对沙宣了解多少
不过那玩意可不便宜
l don't know how much you know about
Vidal Sassoon, but that shit ain't cheap.

94
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,828
我会冲出收视率的
l can rally. l will rally.

95
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,630
你最好是能冲,天天冲
You do rally. Every day, Abby.

96
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,572
不过我担心的是
But that's what worries me.

97
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,366
你冲不了多高
That even you won't be enough.

98
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,605
我不能让高层主宰节目内容
l should not be letting
corporate management...

99
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,179
这是我的节目
...dictate the content of this show.
lt's my show.

100
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,215
我掌控一切
我该取消今晚约会
l control it.
l should skip the date tonight.

101
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,409
回家想点子
Stay home,
think up some ideas for sweeps.

102
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,850
当然不行
Absolutely not, Abby.

103
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,456
你应该要出门去观察人
You should be out there
observing humanity.

104
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,594
-人才是我们节目的观众
-是啊,只有2.47趴
-Humanity is who watches our show.
-Yeah. All 2.4 7 percent of them.

105
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,923
你跟这家伙的约会改了三次时间
You have rescheduled
on this guy three times.

106
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,963
今晚再爽约,他就跑了
You cancel on him tonight
and he's gone.

107
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,692
看看这个骨架
Look at this bone structure.

108
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,565
这可能是你未来儿女的骨架
This could be the bone structure
of your future children.

109
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,468
你希望他们长相俊俏吧?
Don't you want them
to be symmetrical?

110
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,869
你调他的档案来看?
You printed his profile?

111
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,544
是啊,你已经很久没吸到阳气了
What? Yes. These have not
been touched in some time.

112
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,873
我还得忍受你的烂约会经验
l have to live vicariously
through your life.

113
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,549
我觉得这可以当我们下一个男友
l really think that this
could be our next boyfriend.

114
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,981
-嗨
-你好
-Hi.
-Hello.

115
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,987
我找一位棕发蓝眼、强壮的男人
l'm looking for a guy with sandy brown
hair, athletic build, blue eyes.

116
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,625
他身高170,我知道你觉得他矮
He's 5'9''. Which l know
you're thinking is short...

117
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,319
-他看过《大亨小传》两次…
-我身高其实是168
-...but he's read The Great Gatsby--
-Well, technically 5'8'' and a half...

118
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:42,467
要的话我可以再看一次《大亨小传》
...but l could read The Great Gatsby
again if it makes it any better.

119
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,104
要不要点些水来喝?
Hi. Can l get some water
for the table?

120
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,068
好,一瓶瓶装水,谢谢
Yeah, a bottle of flat water, please?

121
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,263
-好的
-谢谢
-Sure.
-Thank you.

122
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,967
等一下,对不起
你知不知道研究结果显示…
Just one second. l'm sorry. Did you
know they've done studies that show...

123
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,739
自来水和瓶装水其实都一样
...tap water and bottled water
are the same thing.

124
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,247
最近法令还规定
餐厅都必须过滤自来水
They passed a law where restaurants
have to filter their tap water...

125
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,478
因此自来水跟瓶装水其实没两样
...so it's filtered water,
which is the same as bottled water...

126
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,156
你根本不用多花钱买水,对吧?
...except you don't have to pay
7 dollars for it.

127
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,657
不知耶,我喜欢瓶装水的口感
再来两杯威士忌加冰块
l like the way it tastes better.
Can l get a Scotch on the rocks too?

128
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,159
-谢谢
-好的
-Thank you.
-Oh, yeah.

129
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,497
我以为…
l thought....

130
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,330
你的档案说你喜欢喝红酒
l thought in your profile it said you--
You like to drink red wine.

131
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,601
-你印了我的档案?
-是我助理印的
-You printed out my profile?
-My associate producer did.

132
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,177
她希望我有准备
不是说我都没准备啦
She doesn't like me to not be prepared.
Not that l'm ever not prepared.

133
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,508
对了,你的车险规划真赞
Kudos, by the way, on your
comprehensive car insurance plan.

134
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,447
-我档案里没那个
-对,是背景调查写的
-That wasn't in my profile.
-No, but it's in your background check.

135
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,615
跟我谈谈你自己吧
So tell me about yourself.

136
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,658
还有什么你不知道的呢?
Well, what's left to talk about
that you don't already know?

137
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,192
说的对
Good point.

138
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,862
其实
All right, well, you know...

139
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,662
我很冒昧的印出一些
谈话重点
...l actually took the liberty
of printing out some talking points...

140
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,498
以备不时之需
...in case this happened.

141
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,197
-我怎么觉得这种事以前发生过?
-没…
-l take it this has happened before?
-No. No.

142
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,175
只是在我清单上的
十项必备条件中你具备九项
But you have nine out of 1 0 of the
necessary attributes on my checklist.

143
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,006
老天爷,好吧
Oh, dear God. Okay.

144
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,309
这个好,就从第三点开始吧
Oh, this is a good one.
Let's start with three, okay?

145
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,371
别问了
Don't ask.

146
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,148
广告之后继续为您报导
More on this when we come back.

147
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,682
动物园不得已必须…
We'll hear from a zoo official
forced to take--

148
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,583
回到《真相挖挖哇》,在今晚
我们来谈谈
And we're back with The Ugly Truth,
where we're gonna be talking about...

149
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,225
男人跟女人真正想要的是什么
...what it is men and women
really want in relationships.

150
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:52,125
我最近看了一些书
《聪明与愚笨之间》
I've been looking through some books.
Smart Women, Foolish Choices.

151
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,825
《男人最爱痛恨他们的女人》
Men Who Love Women
Who Hate Them.

152
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,895
还有《恨女人的男人
讨厌爱男人的女人》
And Women Hating Men Who
Loved Women Who Hate Loving Men.

153
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:06,370
浪费几十亿在这些烂书上
Billions and billions wasted
on psychobabble bullshit.

154
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,548
听清楚了,女人,我只说一次
Now, listen up, ladies, because
l'm only gonna say this once...

155
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,116
只有几个字
...and it is just three little words:

156
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,618
男人很简单
Men are simple.

157
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,414
我们学不乖的
We cannot be trained.

158
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:23,994
这些男人不懂的废话
根本是浪费你的时间和金钱
All this, ''men are from Venus'' crap
is a waste of your time and money.

159
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,460
你想当老处女,随便你
You wanna be a lonely hag,
then that's fine...

160
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,258
继续看这堆蠢书吧
...keep reading these stupid books.

161
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:32,563
若想征服情海,唯一秘诀是
But you want a relationship,
then here's how you get one:

162
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,002
多踩阶梯瘦身机!
lt's called a Stairmaster.

163
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,004
努力塑身,让身材火辣
Get on it, and get skinny...

164
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,973
再加上一些性感内衣
...and get some trashy lingerie
while you're at it...

165
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,342
因为最终,我们只看外表
...because at the end of the day,
all we're interested in is looks.

166
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,518
没人会第一眼爱上你的个性
And no one falls in love
with your personality at first sight.

167
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,449
我们都爱你的浪乳翘臀
We fall in love with your tits
and your ass...

168
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,455
我们死缠烂打
只是想和你的肉体玩十八招
...and we stick around because of
what you're willing to do with them.

169
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,594
所以要想赢得男人心
不用十八招
So you wanna win a man over,
you don't need 1 0 steps...

170
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,197
一招就可以搞定
就是一流的吹功
...you need one,
and it's called a blowjob.

171
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,697
记得还要这样…
And don't forget to....

172
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,434
懂了没?现在来接叩应
Okay? Now, let's take the first caller.

173
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,041
你竟敢烧那些书
How dare you burn those books.

174
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,268
它们对我好处多多
They've helped my personal life
more than I can say.

175
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,310
公主,你男友叫什么名字?
What's your boyfriend's name,
princess?

176
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,277
我现在没有伴
Well, I'm not seeing anyone
right now.

177
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,008
我就说嘛,史瑞克
下一位
My point exactly, Shrek. Next caller.

178
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,686
你在线上了
You're on the air.

179
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,721
你是说男人没有爱的能力?
So you're saying that men
are incapable of love?

180
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,852
我戳破了你的浪漫爱情梦?
Oh, did I burst your little
harlequin romance bubble?

181
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,119
怎样?拜托
What? Come on.

182
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,456
你唯一戳破的是你的可信度
The only thing you burst
is your credibility.

183
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,997
男人完全有体验爱情的能力
Men are completely capable
of experiencing love.

184
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,169
我买帐,说吧,这家伙是谁?
Okay, l'll bite. Go on.
Who's the guy?

185
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,895
-什么?
-这个完美先生
-What?
-The guy. Mr. Wonderful.

186
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,507
这个很会爱的人
他是谁?长相如何?
The one who's so capable of love.
Who is he? What's he like?

187
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,872
他聪明、英俊却不自知
He's smart, he's handsome
but he doesn't know it.

188
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,072
他事业成功又位居要职
He's successful, but in a job
that means something.

189
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:55,549
他喜欢红酒、野餐、古典音乐
He loves red wine, picnics,
classical music.

190
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,245
这家伙住美国对吧?
This is a guy in America, right?

191
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,981
你不是从欧洲打来的吧?
l mean, you're not calling
from Europe or something?

192
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,524
他爱狗,不过却更爱猫
He loves dogs,
but he's more of a cat person.

193
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,992
他星期天绝对不会比我早起床
He never gets up before you
on a Sunday morning.

194
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,256
等等,我懂了
Wait a second, l get it.

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,524
你是蕾丝边
You're a lesbian.

196
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,031
-什么?
-一定是啦
-What?
-Well, you must be.

197
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,397
你说的是完美的女人
l mean, you just described
the perfect woman.

198
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,073
你为什么这么不爽这些特质?
Why are you so threatened
by these qualities?

199
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,243
也许是因为你啥都没有
ls it perhaps because you don't
possess a single one of them...

200
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,607
这也是你没女人爱的原因
...and that is the real reason
why women aren't interested in you?

201
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,113
好,我自掏腰包给你一百元
Okay. Okay, l'll give you 1 00 bucks
of my own money...

202
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,548
你只要带这家伙来让我见一面
...to go get this guy and bring him
down here and let me meet him.

203
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,689
他就在某个角落里
Well, he's out there, somewhere.

204
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,051
等一下
Wait a second.

205
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,124
这家伙连个影子都没有?
You're not even dating this guy?

206
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,354
没有
我描述的是一个类型
No, l'm describing a type.

207
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,193
我们不就是在谈这个吗?
l thought that's what we were doing.

208
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,063
搞啥?你根本不认识他?
What? You don't even know him?

209
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,296
好,我了了
Whoa, okay, now l get the picture.

210
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,532
等一下
你是野猪妹
Hold on. Oh, you're a dog.

211
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,472
-什么?
-你一定是嘛
-What?
-Well, you must be.

212
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,737
拜托
如果你够辣…
Come on, you heard me.
l mean, if you were--

213
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:59,077
你就会把一些呆头男耍得团团转
lf you were hot, you would be out
breaking some poor schmuck's heart...

214
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:03,415
而不是花时间想像完美先生
...instead of spending all your time
fantasizing about Mr. Wonderful.

215
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,919
认清现实吧
Face it...

216
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,113
你很丑
...you're ugly.

217
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,452
我不丑
l am not ugly.

218
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,596
那好吧,我来帮你一把
Well, okay, let me help you out here.

219
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,664
你最好面对你会终身孤独的现实
You might as well face the fact
that you're gonna be alone...

220
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,132
别再肖想你永远找不到的好男人
...and stop pining away for some
fantasy guy you're never gonna get.

221
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,805
-你怎么可以…
-野猪妹…
-How can you possibly--?
-Hey, Lassie.

222
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:25,170
本节目叫《真相挖挖哇》
不能面对真相,就别叩应
The show's called The Ugly Truth.
lf you can't face it, don't call.

223
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,004
今晚的节目到此差不多了
That wraps it up for this evening.

224
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,944
我是查麦克
提醒你现实永远是残酷的
I'm Mike Chadway reminding you
that the truth is never pretty.

225
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,139
约会进展如何?
How'd the date go?

226
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,347
我很高兴选了那家餐厅
Well, l was very pleased
with the choice of restaurant.

227
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,647
-真是太好了
-为什么?
-That is so awesome.
-Why?

228
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,949
早,各位
Good morning, everyone.

229
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,489
-早
-早
-Morning.
-Morning.

230
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,991
在我播带子之前,我警告各位
Now, before l play you this,
l should warn you...

231
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,925
这家伙有点粗
...this guy's a little rough
around the edges.

232
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:51,196
-认清现实吧,你很丑
-我不丑
-Face it, you're ugly.
-I am not ugly.

233
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,200
-怎么…
-我们干嘛看这个?
-Well--
-Why are we watching this?

234
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,430
见过我们的新名嘴
Say hello
to our new guest commentator.

235
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,508
我先排他一周两段,一段三分钟
l'm starting him at two segments
a week, three minutes a pop.

236
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,941
-你是在耍我吗?
-这家伙是哪里冒出来的?
-Are you kidding me?
-Who the hell is this guy?

237
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,945
-我叫查麦克
-他是个反女人的白目男
-Name's Mike Chadway.
-And he's an uber-moron misogynist...

238
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,119
他是电视和社会的反面教材
...who represents everything wrong
with television and society.

239
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,379
我每次的提议都被批得满头包
l get crap every time l suggest
we do something remotely fluffy.

240
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,716
拜托,他的风格自成一派
Oh, come on.
He's got a point of view.

241
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,553
我们不必喜欢
我们是新闻人
We don't have to like it.
l mean, we're newspeople.

242
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,286
我们很客观
李似端访问绑匪…
We're objective.
Stone Phillips interviews terrorists.

243
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,795
不代表喜欢他们
他是为了收视率
Doesn't mean he likes them,
he does it for ratings.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,865
我有一狗票的点子能改善收视率
l have a list of ideas
to improve ratings.

245
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,628
-你会喜欢的,我们不需要他
-我们不需要他
-You'll like it. We don't need him.
-Not at all.

246
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,671
-市长的亲密档案
-我喜欢
-''An intimate profile of the mayor.''
-l like that.

247
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,398
-我喜欢市长
-这个赞
-l like the mayor.
-Fantastic.

248
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,134
-市长?
-对,内容铁定劲爆又有趣
-The mayor?
-Yes. lt can be edgy and yet intriguing.

249
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,836
除非你能现场直播
Unless you can get him to bang
three crack whores...

250
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:40,610
他连上三女加一只狼狗
否则根本没人想看
...and a German shepherd on live TV,
no one's gonna give a shit.

251
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,913
对不起,我刚刚在外面偷听
Oh, l'm sorry.
l was eavesdropping out in the hall.

252
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,160
我是怎么说的?这家伙赞吧?
What did l tell you?
lsn't this guy great?

253
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,691
谢了,老板
Oh, thanks, boss.

254
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,026
你已经雇用他了?
You already hired him?

255
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,426
这位尤物是谁啊?
Who's this delightful creature?

256
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,226
我是制片
l'm your producer.

257
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,627
嗨
Hey.

258
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,206
我喜欢女人在上位
l like a woman on top.

259
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,437
天哪
God.

260
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,668
-不错的办公室
-他开玩笑的啦
-Nice office.
-He's just kidding.

261
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,938
是啊
Oh, yeah.

262
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,944
-这是怎样
-麦克,看过你的办公室没?
-Excuse me.
-Mike, you see your office?

263
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,616
-还没
-来,我带你去
-No, l didn't.
-Let me show you.

264
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,286
-赞啦
-休息五分钟,我马上回来
-Beautiful.
-Everybody take five. l'll be right back.

265
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,854
你们没上过性骚扰防治课吗?
Were you all not there last year
for our sexual-harassment meeting?

266
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,185
-是啊,赖瑞,你没上过吗?
-他必须去
-Were you not there, Larry?
-He needs to go.

267
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,883
他又没有骚扰我
He wasn't sexually harassing me.

268
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,797
我是得过奖的新闻制片
l am an award-winning news producer.
Award-winning producer.

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,800
我是得过奖的新闻制片
我是得过奖的新闻制片
l am an award-winning news producer.
l am an award-winning news producer.

270
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,562
你是得过奖的新闻制片
You're an award-winning
news producer.

271
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,798
-你不敲门的啊?
-我敲了,你没反应
-You don't knock?
-Well, l did knock. You didn't answer.

272
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,877
所以基本上,你的敲门无效
So essentially, your knock was negated
by your complete lack of adherence...

273
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,106
因你完全不懂敲门后应有的礼仪
...to the social etiquette
that follows a knock.

274
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,282
哇,在上面这么紧张啊
You're wound like a fucking top.

275
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,785
汪、汪
记得我的声音吗?
Woof, woof. Remember the bark?

276
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,220
昨晚,我们通过电话
Last night,
a little phone conversation we had.

277
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,622
对哦!真想不到
Yeah. Hey, what do you know?

278
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,160
真是的,你不像野猪妹嘛
You're not ugly at all.

279
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,730
我还真松了一口气
Oh, well, imagine my relief.

280
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,958
我想感谢你给我机会
l want to thank you
for getting me this gig.

281
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,295
要不是你我根本没搞头
l would never have gotten it
without you.

282
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,768
你和我,做出好节目
You and l, we make good TV.

283
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,372
你的节目…
You make imbecilic trash...

284
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,975
根本是给低能的人看的
...watched by housebound inbreds
who are so busy...

285
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,340
他们的手忙着伸进裤子里自爽
没时间按遥控器转台
...with their hands down their pants,
they can't change the remote.

286
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,607
没想到你会那样,不过这画面很赞
l hadn't been picturing you that way,
but it's a nice image.

287
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,341
我根本不看你的节目
l do not watch your program.

288
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,417
是我的咪咪不小心踩到遥控器
My cat stepped on the remote.

289
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,750
你想要我感谢你的咪咪?
Oh, you want to
thank your pussy for me, then?

290
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,028
赖瑞、乔雅你们听我说
我要你们搞死他
Larry, Georgia, listen to me.
l want you to skewer him.

291
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,165
我要查麦克死无葬身之地
l want Mike Chadway
to go down in flames.

292
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,427
我要查麦克在你们身旁化成灰烬
l want Mike Chadway to be nothing
but a pile of ash next to you.

293
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,368
我要打扫阿桑进来
l want the janitor to come vacuum up
the ashes of Mike with his Dustbuster...

294
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:46,032
用强力吸尘器把他的灰给吸光
再把灰都倒在外面的垃圾箱里
...and when he dumps it outside,
l want the rats to vomit and defecate...

295
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,143
让老鼠在他的灰烬上又吐又拉
...on the ashes of Mike Chadway.

296
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,243
我还以为你比较泼辣呢
And l thought
you were angry and bitter.

297
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,280
不,赖瑞
泼辣的是我饥渴的欲望
No, Larry,
that would be my untouched vagina.

298
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,811
-查麦克
-什么?
-Chadway?
-What?

299
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,684
在过20秒上现场
Twenty seconds to air.

300
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,416
准备好了?赖瑞?
About ready? Larry?

301
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,061
-我的化妆间有只小鸟
-我会搞定
-There's a bird in my dressing room.
-l'll take care of it.

302
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,854
-真的鸟?
-对,四处乱飞
-A real bird?
-lt's flying around.

303
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,054
-是麻雀?
-干嘛问?
-A sparrow?
-Why?

304
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,291
-我不知是什么鸟,就是一只鸟
-这里的保全真糟
-l don't know what type of bird it is.
-Security here is awful.

305
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,902
你们该把门关好
You guys have really got to keep
the doors closed.

306
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,699
四、三
Four, three....

307
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,700
各位早安,我是费赖瑞
又是沙加缅度美好的一天
Morning, everyone, l'm Larry Freeman.
Another beautiful day in Sacramento.

308
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,641
我与一位美女同坐在此
And I'm here with
a beautiful woman.

309
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,974
-一号机
-好,开始了
-Go, 1 .
-All right, here we go.

310
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,172
谢谢你,赖瑞
Thank you, Larry.

311
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,012
-你好,我是波乔雅
-好,准备给乔雅特写
-I'm Georgia Bordeney.
-Ready for the single on Georgia.

312
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,849
多年来,电视水平低下常引争议
For years, there have been concerns
about lowering television standards.

313
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,652
但许多人相信此人与其小众节目
But many believe that this man
and his local public-access show...

314
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,590
将水平带到了新低点
...have brought things to a new low.

315
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,423
在此,我们欢迎查麦克
With that,
we welcome Mike Chadway.

316
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,157
各位好
How you doing, guys?

317
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,565
麦克,你对于
说你节目烂的人有何回应?
Mike, how do you respond to people
who say your show is offensive?

318
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,399
的确是的,不过真相也是如此
Well, it is.
But then again, so is the truth.

319
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,503
什么的真相?
The truth about what, Mr. Chadway?

320
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,508
男女关系的真实面孔
What relationships are really like.

321
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,344
就拿婚姻来说吧
Take marriage, for instance.

322
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:01,042
那结合了社会压力、地位和性
lt's about social pressure,
status and sex.

323
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:05,618
没这三样,女人根本懒得理你
lf it weren't for these three things,
men and women wouldn't even speak.

324
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,622
天哪,听来你是根本没人爱
Oh, dear. Sounds to me
like no one's ever loved you...

325
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,319
还把怒气发在女性族群的身上
...and you're taking that out
on the female population.

326
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,855
说得好
Good one.

327
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,092
-这真像《全民开讲》
-那节目不错
-lt's like Crossfire.
-That was a good one.

328
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,293
乔雅,就我们观察
While we're making
these observations...

329
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,465
你们投射出完美夫妻的形象
而这很明显根本是假象
...you two project this image of the
perfect couple, when clearly it's a lie.

330
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,639
什么?
Excuse me?

331
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,972
-妈呀
-进广告
-Holy shit.
-Break for commercial.

332
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,445
-不、不、不
-老大说不管怎样都继续播
-No.
-Stuart said keep rolling no matter what.

333
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,448
什么?这是我的节目
What? When? This is my show.

334
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,587
-现在不是了
-现在不是
-Not right now, it isn't.
-Not right now.

335
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,587
拜托,赖瑞
我看你的节目很多年了
Come on, Larry.
l watched your show for years.

336
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,989
你以前是那么威风凛凛
You used to be this cool,
confident cat.

337
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,962
你是怎么回事?
What the hell happened to you?

338
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,759
还有你,乔雅
这位可不是没脑袋的笨女人
And you, Georgia.
l mean, this one's no dumb bunny.

339
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,333
她知道唯一往上爬的方法
The only way she was getting
off the weekend shift...

340
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,868
就是钓上你这个金龟婿
...was by hooking up with you.

341
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,098
之后,她变得比你更有人气了
Then, lo and behold, she became
more popular than you did.

342
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,969
领的钱还多你两倍
Ended up with twice your salary.

343
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,645
-二号摄影机,拍两人表情
-快啊,赖瑞,撂倒他
-Camera 2, two-shot.
-Come on, Larry, take him down.

344
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,077
等等,我为我老婆的成功骄傲
Hold on, pal.
l am very proud of my wife's success.

345
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,751
骄傲个头啦,你恨死她的成功
Baloney, you are.
You hate her success.

346
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,510
她让你觉得自己没骨气
You feel emasculated by her.

347
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,484
这搞得你满脑子乌烟瘴气的
And that screws with your head.

348
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,318
结果也害你成了不举男
Which, in turn,
screws with your manhood.

349
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,516
你的重点是什么?
What's your point?

350
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,959
-对,乔雅,掌控情势
-乔雅,我的重点是…
-Yes, Georgia, take control.
-My point, Georgia....

351
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,793
你丈夫有一阵子
My point is that your husband...

352
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,491
没碰你了
...hasn't had sex with you in...

353
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,361
我敢说,有三个月了
...l'm gonna say,
what, three months?

354
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,770
-麦克,那不是我的错
-我知道
-Chadway, that is not my fault.
-l know.

355
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,877
-你嘛帮帮忙!
-我知道,是她的错
-l mean, come on.
-l know, l know. lt's her fault.

356
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,309
怎么是我的错?
Why is it my fault?
What am l supposed to do?

357
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,779
难道我该拒绝高薪让他硬起来?
Say no to the money
so he can get an erection?

358
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,781
她在主播台上说硬起来
She just said ''erection''
on television.

359
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,546
-其它电视台也一样,没什么啦
-他们在谈软硬的问题
-Other networks do it.
-They're talking about erections.

360
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,484
幼幼台也会说硬起来啊
They say ''erection''
on Sesame Street.

361
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,215
-我同意
-谢谢
-l agree.
-Thank you.

362
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,654
你在经济上让你老公去势
You've economically emasculated
your husband...

363
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,525
因此他害怕上你
...to such a point
that he's afraid to want you.

364
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,529
当然,你可以甩了他
l mean, sure,
you could dump his ass...

365
00:18:55,734 --> 00:19:00,797
不过你看过这里的好男人没?
阿娘偎…
...but, honey, have you seen the
eligible men in Sacramento? Oh, God.

366
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,032
四十岁的女人选择可不多
lt's slim pickings for a woman
in her 40s, l can tell you.

367
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,232
四十岁?
Forties?

368
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,071
-喔,天啊
-继续拍乔雅和麦克
-Oh, God.

...any better than Larry.

373
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,988
你必须让他当男子汉
You just have to let him be a man.

374
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,721
-让他当男子汉,乔雅
-我让他当男子汉
-Let him be a man, Georgia.

-Let him be a man.
-You have to let me.

-你就是
-l'm not frowny.

过来给这位美女一个热吻
Move in here and give
this beautiful woman a kiss.

381
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,739
-天啊,太离谱了
-不举?
-God. This is ridiculous.
-McFlaccid?

382
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,242
-你真认为我不举?
-对,就是,吻她
-That mean what l think it means?
-Yes. Kiss her.

383
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,415
-不…他们不会
-在我面前吻她
-No. They're not gonna--
-Give it to her, right in front of me.

384
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,083
-也在大众面前
-让我…
-And in front of them.
-Let me--

385
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,947
该死,乔雅,让我当男子汉
Goddamn it, Georgia,
let me be a man.

386

-No!
-Zoom in on that, 2. Zoom in.

387
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,883
观众不会想看这个的
America doesn't want to see this.

388
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,550
朋友,这就是挖出来的真相
And that, my friends,
is the ugly truth.

389
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,890
准备进广告
Get ready to roll to break.
Ready to roll--

390

我就说那家伙很行的

...over 300 e-mails,

-How is that possible?
-Well, l don't know.

403
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,068
不过我要缩短新闻时间
挪来播《真相挖挖哇》
But l am scaling back the news
and giving it to The Ugly Truth.

404
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:43,298
史都华,我认为这是不对的
我们对这家伙到底认识多少?
Stuart, l really think this is a mistake.
What do we even know about this guy?

405
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,671
-他到底是谁?
-他十岁移居本地

恭喜?

麦克,我是萝纶
我周六办轰趴
Mike. Hi, it's Lauren.
I'm having a party on Saturday...

你很清楚我喝了酒会怎样
...and you know what happens
when I drink tequila.

416
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,991
是我,妮基
你怎么都没打给我?我好想你
It's me, Nikki. Why haven't you
called me? I miss you.

417

-Dripping wet--
-How was--?

420

学校好吗?
How was school?

421
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,679
-你完全骗倒我了
-什么?
-Well, you totally hosed me.
-What?

422
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,981
上周你在节目上说
对辣妹一定要凶
Last week on your show, you said,
''Always be mean to hot girls...

423
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,387
她们才会哈你
我对萧娜试了这招
...because they'll want you more.''
Well, l tried it on Shauna.

424
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,857
她哭了,接着我就被罚课后留校
She cried, and then l got detention.

425
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,930
首先,不要听我在节目上说的话
First of all,
don't listen to what l say on my show.

426
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:18,197
其次,这招对25岁的妹才有用
Second of all, you're supposed
to do that to 25-year-old girls...

427
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,065
尤其是自认性感又吸引男人的妹
...who think they're hot
and can get any guy they want...

428
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,434
不是14岁的妹
...not 1 4-year-old girls.

429
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,074
她们正值青春期
They're going through puberty.

430
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,541
麻烦已经够多了
They got enough problems.

431
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,045
妈说她14岁时是全班最美的
Mom said when she was 1 4,
she was the prettiest girl in class.

432
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:35,242
她14岁时我在场,我告诉你吧
她说谎
Well, l was there when she was 1 4,
and let me tell you something. She lied.

433
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,944
别听你麦克叔叔的
Don't listen to your Uncle Mike.

434
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,091
他那时满脑子只想自己摸自己
He was blind from touching himself
inappropriately.

435
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,056
你对儿子还真坦白啊
That's a nice thing to tell your son.

436
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,923
他在你节目上听到的更精彩吧
Like he hasn't heard worse
on your show.

437
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,191
希望你在大电视台有收a一点
Let's hope you can clean it up
now that you're on a network.

438
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,232
恭喜你!

达太安,不行!不可以!
D'Artagnan, no, you didn't.

440
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,113
你给我回来,快回来
No, D'Artagnan, you get back here.
Get back here.

441
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,952
不要!不…
No, do not-- No, no, no.

442
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,320
达太安
D'Artagnan.

443
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,233
达太安
D'Artagnan.

444
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,197
妈啦!
Shit.

445
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,432
好吧

我上去
l'll just come up.

447
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,643
我身手没那么好
我来了
l'm really not that flexible, D'Artagnan.
l'm coming.

448
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,677
我会救你,等等
l got you, hold on.

449
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,941
等等,过来,宝贝
Hold on. Come here, baby.

450
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,676
不…过来,达太安
No, no. No, no. Come on.
Come here, D'Artagnan.

451
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,913
乖猫咪
好孩子,好了
Good boy. Oh, good boy. Okay.

452
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,148
好了,你不会有事的
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

453
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,085
希望我们下得去
l hope we can get down.

454
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,469
哇塞
Oh, my.

455
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,769
哇塞
Oh, my.

456
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,342
哇哇塞
My, my.

457
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,645
他用牙线耶
He flosses.

458
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,951
天哪!我的天哪
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

459
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,527
快来人帮帮我,救命!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

460
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,664
我卡在树上了!
l'm stuck in a tree!

461
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,198
救命!
来人啊!
Help me! Anybody!

462
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,962
-我卡在树上
-别紧张
-l'm stuck in a tree! l'm stuck!
-Stay, stay calm.

463
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,867

-放我下来!我下不去!
-You're gonna be fine.
-Get me down! Get me down!

464
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,041
对不起,我的老天
Sorry. Oh, my God.

465
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,979
你刚搬来啊,太好了
So you just moved in. That's great.

466
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,375
我是艾比
l'm Abby, by the way.

467
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,312
是你对面的邻居
Your neighbor from across the way.

468
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,250
-原来你是医生
-整形外科医师
-So you're a doctor?
-An orthopedic surgeon.

469
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,721
是啊,我常修整腿和臀的伤口
不过我偶尔也医脚
Yeah, l do a lot of leg and hip stuff,
but l do get the occasional foot.

470
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,054
你脚踝只是扭伤,这应该有用
Your ankle seems to be fine.
Just a mild sprain, this should help.

471
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,525
太好了,谢谢你
Great. Thank you.

472
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:04,430
看来我的猫选你窗外的树来爬
算我走运罗
l guess l'm pretty lucky my cat chose
the tree outside your window to climb.

473
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,670
你有任何需要随时找我
l'm here whenever you need me.

474
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,739
我把我家电话写在名片背面
l'm gonna put my home number
on the back of my business card.

475
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,842
要是你脚踝有问题,就打给我
lf your ankle starts giving you
any problems, give me a call.

476
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,604
太好了,谢谢
Great. Thanks.

477
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,441

Oh, wow, that's so weird.
He doesn't usually like men.

478
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:25,419
你知道,狗是不错啦
不过我更爱猫
Well, you know,
dogs are great, but l'm a cat person.

479
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,258
好耶

486
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,579

-是哦
-You forgot your cat.
-Right.

487
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,914

00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,965
-身材比例?
-超完美的
-Symmetrical?
-Oh, you have no idea.

494
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,158
-老天爷
-对
-Oh, good Lord.
-Yeah.

495
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,497
怎么结束的?他有跟你要电话?
How did you leave it?
He ask for your number?

496
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,674
没,不过他给了我他的,怎样?
我该打给他吗?
No, but he gave me his.
Should l call him?

497
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,968
-打去要说什么?
-好,冷静下来
-lf l call do call him, what should l say?
-Okay. Take a breath.

498
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,976
-还有拜托,别提自来水的事
-不提自来水
-And please, sweetheart, no tap water.
-No tap water.

499
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,411
-谈都别谈
-你眼神好性感
-Don't bring it up.
-You've got naughty eyes.

500
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,177
-有人说过吗?
-我每一寸都性感
-Anyone ever tell you that?
-l have naughty everything.

501
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,121
-先等一下
-不,你不会被骂的
-Hold that thought.
-No, hey, you won't get in trouble.

502
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,315
继续啊
Down a bit. Down a bit.

503
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,286
好了
Okay.

504
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,327
掰,凯伦
Bye, Karen.

505
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,358
放干净、少低级、照脚本来
Keep it clean, moving,
stick to the script.

506
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,560
这是直播新闻节目
You are on a live
affiliate news program.

507
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,172
你没有权利
把口和交放在同个句子里
You do not have the luxury of using
''blow'' and ''job'' in the same sentence.

508
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,538
要是你敢说低俗的话,你就完了
lf you say anything scatological,
you will be fired.

509
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,939
-当真?
-对
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

510
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,944
因为我觉得要是你让我不爽的话
l thought that you were the one
that was gonna get fired...

511
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,616
被炒的人会是你
...if you don't keep me happy.

512
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,351
对了,我有张需求清单要给你
Yes. l've got a list of demands that
l would like to make after the show...

513
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,048
还有我警告你
我保证内容绝对低俗
...and let me just warn you,
they're gonna be scatological.

514
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,394
看在你今天很美丽的份上
Just because you look pretty today...

515
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,660
我不计较你仇视男人的烂态度
...l won't mention the misguided
phallic rage you just displayed.

516
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,134
听到我的声音就照我说的去做
When you hear my voice,
just do what l say.

517
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,466
记得要说下流的话
Promise you'll talk dirty?

518
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,234
早安,沙加缅度,我是费赖瑞
Good morning, Sacramento.
I'm Larry Freeman.

519
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,877
我是波乔雅
And I'm Georgia Bordeney.

520
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,171
我是查麦克
And I'm Mike Chadway.

521
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,815
这是《真相挖挖哇》
And this is The Ugly Truth.

522
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,485
我们每天都花上几分钟
Where we'll be taking
a few minutes every day...

523
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:39,020
谈谈男人、女人和男女关系
...to talk about men,
women and relationships.

524
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,919
今天就从男人开始吧
Let's start with men.

525
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:42,150
男人很简单
Men are simple.

526
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,854
为了说明我的观点
这里有个典型的浪漫场景
To illustrate my point, here we have
a classic romantic setting.

527
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,899
这里有烛光、香槟
We have candlelight, champagne,
and even...

528
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,696
甚至还有专属的小提琴手
...your own personal violinist.

529
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,372
现在
Now...

530
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,174
这边则是截然不同
...over here,
we have something quite different.

531
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,344
-我工作单上没这个
-跟我来
-This isn't on my list.
-Follow me.

532
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,410
这段节目结束了?
ls the segment over?

533
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,048
他要去哪里?
Where the hell's he going?

534
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,344
-跟着他,跟着他
-跟他走,遥控组
-Follow him. Follow him.
-Go with him, Remote 1 .

535
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:12,512
-嘿
-美女果冻摔角
-Hey.
-Babes wrestling in Jell-O.

536
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,750
-果冻,真不错啊
-艾比
-Oh, Jell-O. That's great.
-Hello? Abby?

537
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,293
-有观众叩应狂骂
-上帝啊
-People calling and freaking out.
-Oh, Jesus.

538
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,396
-坐下
-把监视器打开
-Sit down!
-Turn the monitor up.

539
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,399
我来快速调查一下
看看男人会选哪一边
Let's take a quick survey and see which
option the men out there would pick.

540
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,867
一个是古典音乐加烛光的晚餐
We have classical music
and candle-lit dinner...

541
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:33,943
一个是近乎全裸的美眉
在草莓口味果冻里摔角
...or semi-naked chicks wrestling
in strawberry-flavored goo.

542
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,137
哇靠!
Oh, shit.

543
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,610
好了,既然要这样玩
就玩得彻底一点
All right. lf we're gonna do this,
we might as well milk it.

544
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,655
二号机用广角镜,一号拍他的手
Two, get ready to go wide.
One, tight on his hand.

545
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,122
舔她手上的果冻
Lick the Jell-O off her finger.

546
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,259
舔她手上的果冻
Lick the Jell-O off her finger.

547
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,563
快啊
Just do it.

548
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,067
我错了
这是樱桃果冻
I was wrong. It's cherry.

549
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,078
镜头转回棚内,乔雅,掰!
Back to you in the studio,
Georgia. Bye.

550
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,142
稍后,我们要造访动物园
Coming up,
we're gonna visit the aquarium...

551
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,115
看看团团圆圆在干嘛
...and see how
Penny the Porpoise is.

552
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,982
它们会玩摔角吗?
Can she clear that 1 0-foot pole...

553
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,953
稍后继续收看
...with a ball on her nose?
When we come back.

554
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,626
稍后继续收看
When we come back.

555
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,194
我闻到3P的味道
Chemistry. l smell threesome.

556
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:36,639
干得好,你们让我允指回味
Great job, ladies.
l can still taste you.

557
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:37,830
你们懂我的意思
You know what l mean.

558
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,211
你知不知道
Do you realize that l once had...

559
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,848
这节目曾邀请过图图大主教
...the Archbishop Desmond Tutu
on this show?

560
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,883
-他谁啊?
-因为你的无知
-Who's that?
-l can't demonstrate how far l've fallen.

561
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,384
我甚至无法表达我做了多大让步
You're not smart enough
to get the references.

562
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,057
等等!我们刚刚不是还合作无间
Hey, wait. l thought
we were a great team back there.

563
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,886
是你叫我舔果冻的
You told me to lick the Jell-O.

564
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,459
你知道我有多恨自己叫你那样吗?
Do you understand
how much l hate myself for that?

565
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,689
那是低俗的刺激
我现在…
lt was cheap titillation.
l am now going to broadcasting hell...

566
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,630
要从加拿大
请那个裸体气象女来报气象了
...right behind
the naked weathergirl from Canada.

567
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,632
真的?
Seriously?

568
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,898
还有裸体气象女?
There's a naked weathergirl?

569
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,233
可以请她来吗?
Hey, can we get her?

570
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,201
为了收视率,你得牺牲
You have to do it
for the ratings, Abby.

571
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,648
想想我儿子
我儿子一直梦想成为造型大师
Think of my son. My son, who had
a dream of being a cosmetician.

572
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,341
想想他,想想乔伊
Think about him. Think about Joy.

573
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,986
为了我上吧
Just do it for me.

574
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:27,488
今天晴时多云
云朵会从我的左胸飘进来
Today it'll be partly sunny with a cloud
cover moving in from my left breast.

575
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:32,391
低气压上移
冷锋即将到来
Low pressure systems are moving up,
so expect a cold front.

576
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,193
早上记得收看查麦克
Watch Mike Chadway
on Sacramento A.M...

577
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,929
每天九点给我们《真相挖挖哇》
...giving us The Ugly Truth
each and every day...

578
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,199
-就在第二频道
-天哪
-...at 9:00, right here on Channel 2.
-Oh, God.

579
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,947
-我以前很爱吃鱼子酱
-直到我发现它是鱼卵做成的
l used to like caviar, until l found out
it was made out of fish eggs.

580
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,880
-你知道吗?
-鱼子酱很倒胃口
-You know that?
-Caviar's revolting.

581
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,078
-我差点呕出来了
-早,各位
-l almost started to gag.
-Morning, ladies.

582
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,257
-约翰
-昨天的收视率
-John.
-Yesterday's ratings.

583
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,187
谢了,约翰
Thanks, John.

584
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,565
我想我该感到高兴,对吧?
Guess l should be happy
about this, right?

585
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,098
对,你以前从没拿过百分之十二
Yeah. Yeah. You've never
gotten a 1 2-share before.

586
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,270
我觉得很罪恶
l feel dirty.

587
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,399
-你听说收视率的事了?
-对,我是制片
-Did you hear about the ratings?
-Yes, l am the producer.

588
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,907
那你听说高层下周…
Then did you hear
corporate's coming next week...

589
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,408
请我吃饭没?
...to take me out to dinner?

590
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,946
希望你会闭着嘴咀嚼食物
Well, let's hope you can chew
with your mouth closed.

591
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,776
你为什么这么恨我?
Why do you hate my guts?

592
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,113
我讨厌的是你的意识型态
Your innards are of no consequence
to me. lt's what you represent.

593
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,913
你憎恨真相
Oh, you hate the truth.

594
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:35,456
你扭曲男女互动的感受
那并不是真相
Your skewed perception of male-female
interaction is not the truth.

595
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,652
而你幻想的男友就是真的?
But your imaginary boyfriend's
the truth?

596
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,798
讲给你听,我碰巧认识了他
For your information,
l happened to meet him.

597
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,299
希望这次他是真的
不然就太悲哀了
Well, l hope he's real this time,
because otherwise this is just sad.

598
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,733
他是真的,非常真实
Oh, he's real. He's very real.

599
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,636
更别提他英俊又品行端正
他是外科医生
Not to mention stunningly handsome,
morally sound. He's a surgeon.

600
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,674
整型外科
An orthopedic surgeon.

601
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,436
-你知道这意味着什么吗?
-什么?
-You know what that means.
-What?

602
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,114
他的手指一定插过某人的屁屁
Had to stick his finger up
some guy's butt in medical school.

603
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,251
你真令人厌恶
You disgust me.

604
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:09,088
-屁屁男开口约你了没?
-还没
-So did Butt Boy ask you out?
-Not yet.

605
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,092
我们喜欢慢慢来
先彼此认识
We're taking things slow,
getting to know each other first.

606
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,924
我干嘛跟你谈这个?
Why am l talking to you about this?

607
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,600
也就是说,他根本没约你
ln other words,
he didn't actually ask you out.

608
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,370
你干嘛?
What are you doing?

609
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,177
医师办公室
Doctor's office.

610
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,009
我是李艾比,我找安医师
Hi. This is Abby Richter
calling for Dr. Anderson.

611
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,616
-请稍等
-好,我等
-Please hold.
-Yes, l'll hold.

612
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,287
你干嘛?干嘛打给这家伙?
不对!应该由他打给你
What are you doing?
Why are you calling this guy? No.

613
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:40,980
-安医生
-柯林,我是艾比
-Dr. Anderson.
-Hi, Colin. This is Abby.

614
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,490
昨晚那个邻居
Your neighbor from last night.

615
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,992
你没事吧?
Hey. Everything okay?

616
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,962
你的脚踝还好吗?
How's the ankle treating you?

617
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,159
好得很
Couldn't be better.

618
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,568
我打来是想告诉你
很高兴昨晚认识你
l was just calling to let you know how
much l enjoyed meeting you last night.

619
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,871
谢了
Thanks.

620
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,978
我在想我们改天可以一起吃个饭
And I was thinking we should
go out for dinner sometime.

621
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,743
城里有间新的法国餐厅
There is a new
French bistro in town...

622
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:11,217
还有一场颇受好评的艺术展览
...and an art opening
that got amazing reviews.

623
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,357
我在想我们星期五可以去一趟
So l was thinking
we could go on Friday.

624
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,725
星期五,这个嘛…
Friday....

625
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,693
-星期六会好一点吗?
-艾比…
-Would Saturday be better?
-Actually...

626
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,732
是这样的
我还没安顿好
...Abby, the thing is,
l haven't really settled in yet.

627
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,834
-你搞什么鬼?
-我在拯救你,他会拒绝你
-What are you doing?
-Saving you. He was blowing you off.

628
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,440
他才没有拒绝我
He wasn't blowing me off!

629
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,543
不要!好吧,他会期待你打给他
Don't. Okay, he'll be
expecting you to call him.

630
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,680
而你没打,他就会打来
And when you don't, he'll call back.

631
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,406
-你怎么知道?
-因为我懂男人
-How do you know?
-Because l know how men operate.

632
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,916
你想跟这家伙有所进展
lf you want it to work out with this guy,
then you'll listen to me...

633
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,386
就要听我的话去做
因为你这通疯狂的电话
...and you'll do exactly as l say.
You've done irreparable damage...

634
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,219
也许已经造成无可弥补的伤害
...with your psycho-aggressive
control-freak phone call.

635
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,621
一切有可能太迟了
lt might even be too late.

636
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,127
要是你能挽救整个情势
And if you do salvage the situation,
you'll never be more than Abby...

637
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,766
-绝不能再变成他饥渴的邻居艾比
-我才没有饥渴
-...his desperate neighbor.
-l'm not desperate.

638
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,233
怎么?我听起来很饥渴吗?
Why? Did you think
l sounded desperate?

639
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:05,368
听听你的口气
饥渴地问我你是不是饥渴
Listen to you. Desperately asking me
if you sound desperate.

640
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,209
好吧
Okay.

641
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:13,544
虽然你不承认
你知道我言之有物
Although you won't admit it, you know
that l know what l'm talking about.

642
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,150
由你来决定
lt's your call, dude.

643
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,088
-好吧,我该怎么做?
-拿起电话说嗨,道格
-Fine. What do l do?
-Pick up and say, ''Hey, Doug.''

644
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,657
-我干嘛说…
-照做就是了
-Why would l--?
-Just do it.

645
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,417
嗨,道格
Hey, Doug.

646
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,158
不,我是柯林
No. This is Colin.

647
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,129
-天哪,真对不起
-做得好
-Oh, my God! l'm so sorry.
-That's perfect.

648
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,634
道格是谁?
Who's Doug?

649
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,498
-道格是谁?
-只是个约会对象
-Who's Doug?
-He's just a guy l'm seeing.

650
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,765
没什么啦
lt's nothing serious.

651
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:41,172
只是个约会对象,没什么啦
Just a guy l'm seeing.
lt's nothing serious.

652
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,481
好吧
Oh, okay.

653
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,445
-请等一下
-请等一下
-Hang on a second.
-Hang on a second.

654
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,175
好
Sure.

655
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,512
-现在呢?
-让他等
-Now what?
-Now just make him wait.

656
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,123
要是他30秒之后还没挂
你也许就有机会了
lf he's still holding on after 30 more
seconds, you may have a chance.

657
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,159
没人会等他想拒绝的对象
No one's gonna wait
for somebody they're trying to blow off.

658
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,057
-你最好没弄错
-给点时间
-You better be right.
-Give me time...

659
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,097
-我让他变你的小狼狗
-我不要狼狗
-...l'm gonna make this guy your bitch.
-l don't want a bitch.

660
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,666
柯林也不是狼狗
Colin would never be a bitch.

661
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,166
他是有能力的人
He is a well-rounded man...

662
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,862
既稳重又专情
...capable of mature emotions
and deep, abiding love.

663
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,009
-都是你欠缺的
-也许吧
-Things which you know not of.
-Maybe not.

664
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,839
不过我懂欲望、诱惑和掌控
But l do know about lust,
seduction and manipulation.

665
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,514
都是你不懂的
Things that you know not of.

666
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,208
艾比,我跟你谈个交易
Abby, l'll make you a deal.

667
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,977
若照我说的做
而你跟这家伙成功交往
lf you do exactly as l say,
and you get this guy...

668
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,656
你就不能再给我苦头,跟我合作
...then you'll quit giving me shit
and work with me.

669
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:30,487
你知我知,我们可以搞大这节目
You know as well as l do
that we could make this show huge.

670
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,720
要是不成功呢?那我得到什么?
And if it doesn't work?
What do l get?

671
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,863
那我就辞职
Then l'll quit.

672
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,660
你真这么有自信?
You're really that confident?

673
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,430
<font size=18 color=#4096d1>(诊所)

674
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,733
已经超过三十秒了
lt's been more than 30 seconds.

675
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,478
好,成交,现在呢?
All right, deal. Now what?

676
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,745
永远要让人记得你
Always make an impression.

677
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,820
走吧,我们还有工作要做
Let's get a move on.
We have work to do.

678
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,425
-那电话怎么…
-五秒之内他会回叩,走吧
-But what about the--?
-ln five seconds, he'll call. Come on.

679
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,324
你是算命仙吗?
What are you, Nostradamus?

680
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,363
真厉害
Amazing.

681
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,764
第一
永远不要批评
Rule number one: never criticize.

682
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,836
-就算是有建设性的批评?
-对
-Even if it's constructive?
-Never.

683
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,032
男人不会成长、改变或进步
Men are incapable of growth,
change or progress.

684
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,337
对男人来说,会上厕所就很强了
For men, self-improvement
ends at toilet training.

685
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,882
第二
不管他说什么都要笑
And rule number two:
laugh at whatever he says.

686
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,609
-要是他说的不好笑呢?
-那不重要
-What if what he says isn't funny?
-That's irrelevant.

687
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,687
-假笑就像假高潮
-假高潮好吗?
-A fake laugh is like a fake orgasm.
-A fake orgasm is good?

688
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,859
不好,不过总比没高潮好
No, but a fake orgasm
is better than no orgasm at all.

689
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,620
-假高潮就是没高潮
-那是对你而言
-A fake orgasm is no orgasm.
-Only to you.

690
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,697
床上不是只有你一个人
别太自私了
You're not the only person in the room,
you know. Let's not be selfish.

691
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,559
这就很完美了
Now, that was perfect.

692
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,098
-真笑还是假笑?
-你永远不会知道
-Real or fake?
-You'll never know.

693
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,973
第三
男人是视觉动物
Rule number three:
men are very visual.

694
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,943
-我们要改变你的外表
-我的外表有何不妥?
-We have to change your look.
-What's wrong with my look?

695
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:02,643
艾比,你是个美女
不过你很难以亲近
Abby, you're a very attractive woman,
but you are completely inaccessible.

696
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,718
你满脑子都是效率
You're all about
comfort and efficiency.

697
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,412
那样有什么错?
What's wrong with comfort?

698
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,559
没什么,只是这让人没性趣
Well, nothing,
except no one wants to fuck it.

699
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,791
-需要我帮忙吗?
-是的
-Hello. May l be of assistance?
-Yes, you may.

700
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,464
我们需要小礼服
We need cocktail dresses...

701
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:18,226
紧身牛仔裤
还要用胸罩让我朋友的奶子…
...tight jeans and some bras
that'll make my friend's breasts...

702
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,428
-挺起来说哈罗
-它们现在没有说哈罗吗?
-...sit up and say hello.
-They're not saying hello now?

703
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,166
-那它们在说什么?
-它们垂头丧气的
-What are they saying?
-They're giving more of a passing nod...

704
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,844
一点也不起眼
...rather than an outright greeting.

705
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,172
这样吧,你试试这件
You know what?
Why don't you try this on?

706
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,647
-我觉得这件不错
-这才叫奶罩嘛
-l think this would be wonderful.
-Now, that is a bra.

707
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,788
奶子在里面就像在说…
快把嘴凑上来,我很美味哦
Boobies in this thing say,
''Put me in your mouth, l taste good.''

708
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,050
我现在就穿着这一件呢
l'm actually wearing one
right now as we speak.

709
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,761
长度很重要
Length is very important.

710
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:51,629
要短得看到雪白的大腿
却又不能短到露出妹妹
We need short enough to see some
thigh, but not so short to see vag.

711
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,805
-那样意图就太明显了
-真的?
-Vag says you're trying too hard.
-You think?

712
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,304
牛仔裤要展现臀部曲线
Jeans are all about
the curvature of the ass.

713
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,499
这方面你的本钱还不赖
You've-- Well, you've got
the raw materials.

714
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,769
现在你只需要适当的展现
Now all you need is
the proper presentation.

715
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:05,278
-你刚说我臀部很好看?
-你都这么迟钝吗?
-Did you just tell me l have a nice ass?
-Do you have to be so crass?

716
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,472
天哪
Jesus.

717
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,346
第四
绝对不要谈你的问题
Rule number four:
never talk about your problems...

718
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,544
因为男人懒得听也不在乎
...because men don't
really listen or care.

719
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,884
-有些男人在乎
-不,是有些男人假装在乎
-Some men care.
-No, some men pretend to care.

720
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,560
当我们问你好不好,其实是说
When we ask you how you're doing,
it's guy code for:

721
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,559
我的老二想更深入了解你
''Let me stick my dick in your ass.''

722
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,222
我知道你认为柯林不会
不过相信我,他是男人
Oh, l know you think Colin is
above it all, but trust me, he's a guy.

723
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,026
只要他对你有一丝丝兴趣
lf he's even remotely into you...

724
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,501
他可能就幻想过
你全身上下的洞至少十次
...he's probably thought about
your orifices at least 1 0 times.

725
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,300
我喜欢听你假设
男人都像你一样贱
l love how you assume all men
are as perverse as you are.

726
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,501
我不是假设
我很清楚
Oh, l don't assume. l know.

727
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,640
等等
我们要再去一个地方
Wait. We need to make
one more stop.

728
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,817
-为什么?我买很多东西了
-你的头发得弄长一点
-Why? l have tons of stuff.
-We have to make your hair longer.

729
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,486
男人爱抓的不只是你的屁股
Men like something to grab onto
other than your ass.

730
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,553
我头发很好,没什么问题
My hair is fine.
There's nothing wrong.

731
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,749
艾比,马尾意味着
你不是操作重机械…
Abby, a ponytail implies that you are
either operating heavy machinery...

732
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,393
就是负责倒垃圾
...or emptying the litter box.

733
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,688
这两样都会让男人硬不起来
Neither of those things
inspires an erection.

734
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,265
硬不硬怎么会该我负责?
这不是他的事吗?
Why is it my responsibility to inspire
an erection? lsn't that his job?

735
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,492
闭嘴啦
Shut up.

736
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,656
怎样?
你觉得呢?
Well? What do you think?

737
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,188
-不算坏
-我不想…
-Not bad.
-l just--

738
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,694
我不想被当成荡妇
l don't wanna be perceived
as a bimbo. l mean....

739
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,525
我也不要你变成荡妇
And l don't want you to be a bimbo.

740
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,635
你必须变成两个人
圣女加浪女
You have to be two people:
the saint and the sinner.

741
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,772
女大生加钢管妹
The librarian and the stripper.

742
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,274
一方面
你得冷淡的拒人于千里之外
On the one hand, you have to push
the guy away with a cold indifference...

743
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,744
另一方面
你得变成性感火辣的金丝猫
...on the other, you have to be
a sexually teasing tornado.

744
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,646
-现在我要教你打情骂俏
-我会打情骂俏
-Now, we have to teach you flirting.
-l know how to flirt.

745
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,115
你会?
You know how to flirt?

746
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,119
我叫艾比,我爱看托尔斯泰
''Oh, my name's Abby,
and l love reading Tolstoy.

747
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:57,124
我也爱猫,还有种花和野餐
l also love cats, gardening,
and romantic picnics.''

748
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,556
我可不这么想
l don't think so.

749
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,458
帅哥,你有穿内裤吗?
Hey, babe,
you wearing any underwear?

750
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,497
我不会这样说话,也不会摸臀
You know what? l wouldn't say that,
and l wouldn't grab ass.

751
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,565
摸臀有什么不对?
What's wrong
with a little ass-grabbing?

752
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,238
臀部不就是给人摸的?
l mean, what's it there for
if for not me to grab it?

753
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,907
女人只是泄欲的工具
You're just a set of orifices
and a pair of teetahs.

754
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:15,340
你的精神有严重的问题
And you are a deeply,
deeply disturbed person.

755
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,741
也许我是个很好的学生
Maybe l'm just a really good student.

756
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,085
-不要再弄了好吗?
-弄什么?
-Would you stop doing that?
-Doing what?

757
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:27,686
手到处乱摸,在我身上
Running your finger down there.
Over me.

758
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,416
怎样?有反应啊?
Why? ls it turning you on?

759
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,120
也许吧
Maybe.

760
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,826
怪了,我好像还满喜欢的
lt's weird, l think l kind of like it.

761
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,624
是吗?
Really?

762
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:40,863
-傻瓜
-我就知道
-Sucker.
-Oh, l knew it.

763
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:44,131
别倒过来教军师了
Okay, no teaching the teacher.
Come on.

764
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,104
-谁啊?
-我是柯林
-Who is it?
-lt's Colin.

765
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,971
我还没准备好,我准备好了?
l'm not ready for this. Am l ready?

766
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,113
-我还没准备好,我没办法
-冷静,冷静
-l'm not ready for this.
-Calm down.

767
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,349
好,短短讲几句话就好,快去
Okay. Keep the conversation
under a minute. Now go.

768
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,486
-几句话?几句话,天哪
-对
-Under a minute? Under a minute.
-Yes.

769
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,713
不,等等…过来
No, wait, wait, wait.
Come here, come here.

770
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,188
你这个卑鄙小人
You're such an asshole.

771
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,953
-嗨
-嘿
-Hi.
-Hey.

772
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,723
-你好美
-谢谢
-Wow, you look great.
-Oh, thanks.

773
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,163
我只是正在洗碗
Yeah, l was just doing the dishes.

774
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,563
-你今天怎么了?
-什么意思?
-What happened to you today?
-What do you mean?

775
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,669
你让我在线上等,还音讯全无
You put me on hold
and never called back.

776
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,501
-天哪,那是你啊
-对啊
-Oh, my God. Was that you?
-Yeah.

777
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,802
-真对不起
-没关系
-l'm so sorry.
-lt's okay.

778
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,707
柯林,你可以待会儿再打给我吗?
Would you mind actually
giving me a call a little later?

779
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,815
我很忙,我得回去洗碗
l'm busy.
Gotta get back to those dishes.

780
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,178
-艾比,等等
-现在呢?
-Abby, wait.
-What now?

781
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,346
这样很好,就折磨他
No, that's good.
Now make him suffer.

782
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:34,854
让他痛苦,受苦吧!
Make him suffer. Suffer.

783
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,084
艾比,我在想你愿不愿意…
Abby, l was wondering
if you'd like to go...

784
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,296
周六一起去看球赛?
...to the Devils game
with me on Saturday.

785
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,337
加油
Go, Comets.

786
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,901
他要打击了
He delivers it.

787
00:41:56,714 --> 00:42:00,582
好,我看得见你
听见请点头
Okay, I have a visual.
Nod if you can hear me.

788
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,348
放轻松,一切会很顺利的
Just relax. lt's gonna be fine.

789
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:09,349
我叫你做什么就照做,好吗?
Now, do exactly what I tell you,
and when I tell you to do it. Okay?

790
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:14,626
-你常看棒球吗?
-含糊的回答他
-You follow baseball?
-Do something noncommittal.

791
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,457
你还好吧?
You okay?

792
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,125
我很好
l'm fine.

793
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,464
那样是有点超过,不过干得好
That was a little over the top,
but nice try.

794
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,608
-谢了
-谢什么?
-Well, thanks.
-For what?

795
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,039
谢谢你…成为你
Well, thanks for being you.

796
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,605
不用客气
You're welcome.

797
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,217
抱歉
Excuse me.

798
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,559
天哪,你是查麦克
Oh, my God. You're Mike Chadway.

799
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,959
我爱死你了
l love you.

800
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,464
-兄弟,你搞什么?
-兄弟,搞什么啊?
-Hey, buddy, what the hell?
-Dude, what the fuck?

801
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,296
-兄弟,搞什么啊?
-什么?
-Dude, what the fuck?
-What?

802
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,267
不…我不是跟你说话
No, no, no. I'm not talking to you.

803
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,270
-我不是跟你说话
-我做错什么事了吗?
-l'm not talking to you.
-Okay, did l do something wrong?

804
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:04,813
不,听着
跟他说你看到他在看别的妹
No, stop. Listen. Tell him you saw him
looking at another girl.

805
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:08,314
我看到你在看别的妹
l saw you--
l saw you looking at another girl.

806
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,318
-谁?
-那个,就在那里
-Who?
-That girl, right there.

807
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,854
我只是想帮我们买热狗吃
l was trying to get us
a couple hot dogs.

808
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,788
-两份,谢谢
-好吧
-Two. Thank you.
-Okay.

809
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,755
好,我们得赶快恢复状况
Okay, we need a quick recovery.

810
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:27,604
记得要优雅缓慢的把热狗放嘴里
Make sure you put the hot dog
in your mouth nice and slowly.

811
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:33,198
男人喜欢看
美眉把形状像老二的食物塞进嘴里
Men like watching penis-shaped food
go into a girl's mouth.

812
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,172
对不起
l'm so sorry.

813
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,474
-天啊,真对不起
-没关系,真的
-Oh, God. l'm so, so sorry.
-No, it's okay.

814
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,844
我能把这清干净,我行的
You know, l can get this out.
l'm sure l can.

815
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,145
-这是什么布料?
-我不知道,棉的吧
-What fabric is this?
-l don't know. Cotton?

816
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:48,052
棉,棉是最糟的了
其实皮革才是最糟的
Cotton. Cotton's the worst.
Well, actually, leather's the worst.

817
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,850
-其次是麂皮
-好
-After that would be suede.
-Okay.

818
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,721
-我认为我可以把它弄干
-艾比
-l think l can get it out.
-Abby.

819
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,520
等等,就快了
Oh, look, hold on. lt's coming!

820
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,507
-哪里?
-那里,在那里
-Where?
-There. Right there.

821
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,405
艾比…你最好抬头看看
Abby?
Abby, you might want to look up.

822
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,682
<font size=18 color=#4096d1>(亲亲摄影机)

823
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,875
干得好,艾比
Way to go, Abby.

824
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,517
我看到你了,我已经就位
Okay, l got you. l'm in position.

825
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,250
-今天还真是精彩
-你真好心
-Can't say today was boring.
-You're being nice.

826
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,725
-我让你丢脸了
-不
-l embarrassed you.
-No.

827
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,262
只是我没遇过你这种女人
You're just not what l'm used to.

828
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,563
-我知道
-不,其实,这真的很不错
-l know.
-No, actually, it's a good thing.

829
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,330
通常我花五秒就能猜透女人心
l'm used to women
l can figure out in five seconds.

830
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,370
可是我却猜不透你
But l can't do that with you.

831
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,273
他是笨蛋,我两秒就看穿你了
He's an idiot.
I figured you out in two.

832
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,946
跟他道晚安,再挤一下奶子
Now, tell him good night
and stick your tits out.

833
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,016
-我们给这家伙最后一击
-那么,晚安了
-We're gonna give this one last shot.
-Well, good night then.

834
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,555
这一吻让我胯下湿得很值得
That definitely made up
for my wet crotch.

835
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,064
我也是
不是,我胯下并没有…
Me too. No, scratch that.
l didn't have one.

836
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,634
对
Yeah.

837
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,431
-回头见了
-是啊
-l'll see you later.
-Yeah.

838
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,628
-好
-掰
-Okay.
-Bye.

839
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,239
晚安
Bye.

840
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,207
-晚安
-晚安
-Night.
-Night.

841
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,549
你成功了!你成功了!
You did it! You did it! You did it!

842
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,089
-我啥都没做
-你有!
-l didn't do anything.
-You did!

843
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,282
-是你!
-不
-lt was you.
-No.

844
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,292
别问我为什么,我想他喜欢你
l mean, don't ask me why,
but l think he likes you.

845
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:36,398
-他很棒吧?
-是啊,他超梦幻的
-He's such a great guy, right?
-Yeah, he's dreamy.

846
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,330
他还完全符合我的十项择偶条件
Yeah. And he fits all 1 0
of the criteria on my checklist.

847
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,401
是哦,我记得前九项
Though weren't items
one through nine...

848
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,301
很像同志恋人才会有的特质
...something to do with him
pretty much being gay?

849
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,073
我不会理你,因为我心情很好
l'm gonna ignore that,
because l am in such a good mood.

850
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,805
我听到了
胯下湿答答
Yeah, l heard. Wet crotch.

851
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,158
在灵长类之中
黑猩猩
Of all the primates,
bonobo monkeys...

852
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,523
与人类最相似
...are the closest relatives
to human beings...

853
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,790
不论基因或社交行为都是
...both genetically and socially.

854
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,366
特别是性
Especially when it comes to sex.

855
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,594
他们用性来结束争执
They use sex
as a way to end an argument.

856
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:17,000
这也是我最爱用的一招
One of my favorite
techniques as well.

857
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,505
事实上,当它们找到新食物
ln fact, when they come upon
a new food source...

858
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,338
它们会搞一下来缓和紧张气氛
...they have a gangbang
in order to decrease tension--

859
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,707
-现场有小孩
-谢谢
-Small person on-set.
-Thanks.

860
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,179
我认为我们人类也该仿效此举
--which is something
we humans should look into.

861
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,614
不…这节目不适合孩子
No, no, no. This is not for children.

862
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,549
没关系,我认识他
lt's okay. l know him.

863
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:32,779
-是吗?
-对
-You do?
-Yeah.

864
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,481
整天坐在那里指挥她们的男人
--sit on their asses all day
and boss their men around.

865
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,526
在我看来是演化的一大差异
Sounds like a great argument
for evolution if you ask me.

866
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,062
朋友,这就是挖出来真相
And that, my friends,
is the ugly truth.

867
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:43,790
进广告
And we're wrapped.

868
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,595
-干得好,麦克
-谢谢,回头见了
-Great job, Mike.
-Thank you. See you guys later.

869
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,801
我裤裆里有只公猩猩在蠢动
Yeah, l've got an adult male
bonobo monkey in my pants.

870
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,533
放出来让我瞧瞧吧
l'd like to see that.

871
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,235
你来这干嘛?
Hey. What are you doing here?

872
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,904
我说过别看我节目,尤其是现场
l told you no watching the show,
especially live.

873
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,913
我需要紧急谘商
l need some emergency advice.

874
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,416
麦崔西邀我参加舞会
Tracy Mclvor asked me
to the Sadie Hawkins dance.

875
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,486
要是我答应会不会很蠢?
ls it dorky if l say yes?

876
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,082
蠢?
Dorky?

877
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,692
才不会,开玩笑
Hell, no. Are you kidding?

878
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:14,057
你比大家强,还有妹倒追你
You're ahead of the game.
Women are coming to you.

879
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,664
你知道这有多帅吗?
You know how cool that is?

880
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,165
好好品尝这一刻吧
Relish this moment, okay?

881
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,599
现在快离开这里,我们五点见
Now get the hell out of here.
l'll see you at 5.

882
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,897
-好
-一起庆祝
-Okay.
-We'll celebrate.

883
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:27,270
-别忘了买披萨,金刚
-我有忘记过吗?
-Don't forget the pizza, King Kong.
-Hey, have l ever?

884
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,436
他跟你一起住?
He lives with you?

885
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,377
住隔壁,跟我妹一起
Well, next door, with my sister.

886
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,518
他是我外甥
He's my nephew.

887
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,286
-可爱的孩子
-对
-Cute kid.
-Yeah.

888
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,752
来
帮我脱
Here, do me.

889
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,082
-你猜怎么着?
-怎么?
-Okay. So guess what.
-What?

890
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,262
柯林打来,他想再约我
Colin called,
he wants to get together again.

891
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,091
天哪
Oh, Lord.

892
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:53,292
我该等多久才能跟他嘿咻?
So how long should l wait
to have sex with him?

893
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,437
你越钓他胃口
Well, the more you
make him beg for it...

894
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,766
就越能让他离不开你
...the more you're gonna
keep him on the hook.

895
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,705
所以除了嘿咻之外
So do everything else but.

896
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,403
玩什么都行
But then show him...

897
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,778
话又说回来了
让他看看在控制狂的外表下
...that beneath
that control-freak exterior of yours...

898
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:11,318
有个性变态等着被解放
...that there's a sexual deviant
waiting to be unleashed.

899
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,820
才不呢,我不是性变态
No. No, l'm not a sexual deviant.

900
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,253
说的好
Good point.

901
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,224
我猜你吃素吃了一阵子
一年?
l'm guessing you've been
out of practice for what, a year?

902
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,794
不到
No.

903
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,597
-十一个月
-妈呀!
-Eleven months.
-God.

904
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,327
十一个月
你怎么活下来的?拜托
Eleven months.
How do you live? Come on.

905
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,403
那你有多常…
So how often do you...?

906
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:32,199
多常怎样?
Do l what?

907
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,973
-多常怎样?
-你知道的
-Do l what?
-You know...

908
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,504
-摸蛤仔
-摸什么蛤仔?
-...flick the bean?
-What bean?

909
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,808
你的蛤仔啊,就在下面
Your bean. Flick it. Down there.

910
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,612
真恶心,你是怎么回事?
Gross! That's what you call it?
What is wrong with you?

911
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,947
其实我都称之为自慰
No, well, actually,
l call it masturbating...

912
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:50,320
不过我觉得那会伤你纤细的自尊
...but l thought that might offend
your delicate ladylike sensibilities.

913
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,426
-所以你多常自摸一次?
-我不知道
-So how often do you flick it?
-l don't know.

914
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,824
你又有多常自摸?
How often do you flick it?

915
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,263
你之所以问我是因为
You're only asking me that
so you can picture me flicking mine...

916
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,867
-你自摸的时候可以想像我自摸
-不
-...while you flick yours.
-No.

917
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,335
我才不会在那时候想你
l would never picture you while l do
that, which is not something l do.

918
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,508
-我不做这种事,从来不做
-你会
-l don't do that, not ever.
-Yes, you would.

919
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,176
-不会
-从来不会?
-No. No. No.
-Never?

920
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,675
我觉得那很没人性
l find it impersonal.

921
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,849
艾比,摸自己蛤仔是最有人性的
Abby, what could be more personal
than you flicking your bean?

922
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,144
-我不认为自己很性感,好吗?
-好吧,我认为你很性感
-l just don't see myself that way, okay?
-Okay, well, l do.

923
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,650
过来
Come here.

924
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,680
你最好开始转念
Well, you better start.

925
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:24,952
要是连你都不想摸自己
柯林怎么会想摸?
Because if you don't wanna have sex
with you, why the hell would Colin?

926
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,139
这是什么?
What is this?

927
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,314
这是什么,小乖?
What is this, baby?

928
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,074
什么?
是什么?
What? What, baby?

929
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,344
<font size=18 color=#4096d1>(这是送给你的蛤仔的!
麦克)

930
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:56,315
这是什么?
这是什么,小乖?
What is this?
What is this, D'Artagnan?

931
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,653
真震爽
''Astrea 1 .''

932
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,430
震动内裤
''Vibrating brief.''

933
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,510
<font size=18 color=#4096d1>(我晚点到
柯林)

934
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,043
好吧
Great.

935
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,090
他说他会晚点到
He said he was running late.

936
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,058
他怎么来了?
What is he doing here already?

937
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,145
-很好,你准备好了
-准备什么?
-Good, you're ready.
-For what?

938
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:26,576
与高层的晚宴
The dinner with corporate.

939
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,250
-你没收到通知?
-没
-Didn't you get my e-mail?
-No.

940
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,682
我也不能去,我跟柯林有约
And l can't. l have a date with Colin.

941
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,018
你有约会不能去?
You can't go
because you have a date?

942
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,783
你不知道她有多难销
You have no idea
how hard those are for her to get.

943
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:40,459
那我们半路去接他
Well, then let's pick him up
on the way.

944
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:44,498
-来吧,我们走
-来啊,走吧
-Come on, let's go. Right now.
-Come on. Come on, let's go.

945
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:47,869
抱歉拦截了你的约会
Sorry to hijack your date, brother.

946
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,301
没关系,你也是制片?
No worries.
You're a producer as well?

947
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,771
不是,我是艺人
No, dude, l'm the talent.

948
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,807
那你是主播罗
So you're an anchor, then?

949
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,445
不是,我负责《真相挖挖哇》
No, l do The Ugly Truth.

950
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,514
-他没看过我们的节目?
-拜托
-Hasn't he ever seen our show?
-Come on, Stuart.

951
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,709
对柯林来说
我们的节目水准太低了
Our show's
way too low-brow for Colin.

952
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,617
-他是医生
-是啊,他是
-He's a doctor.
-Yes, that's right, he is.

953
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:11,157
他不想听隆乳和口交这类话题
He doesn't wanna hear about things
like implants and oral sex.

954
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,353
-你们会谈口交?
-我们到了
-You talk about oral sex?
-Oh, look, we're here.

955
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,733
-你邀请了果冻双胞胎?
-我觉得这点子挺好的
-You invited the Jell-O twins?
-Yeah. l thought it was good thinking.

956
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,495
反正不会有什么损失
Well, it certainly can't hurt.

957
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,971
美眉们,你们真迷人
Ladies, you look quite fetching.

958
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,581
-大家都到了
-嘿
-Hey, hey, the gang's all here.
-Hey.

959
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,409
-哈洛、鲍伯,记得艾比吧?
-你们好,这位是…
-Harold, Bob, you remember Abby.
-Hi. And this is--

960
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,076
-我们都认识查麦克
-这两位可爱的美眉是谁呢?
-And we all know Mike Chadway.
-And who are these lovely ladies?

961
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,314
看来我们今晚不会谈新闻了
Something tells me we won't be
talking about the news tonight.

962
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,459
没错
That's right.

963
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,055
-我们就座吧?
-请往这边来
-Our table's waiting. Shall we?
-Come this way.

964
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:50,757
-麦克,你的表现真赞
-我完全同意
-Mike, you're doing a hell of a job.
-Yeah, l couldn't agree more.

965
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,100
-那倒是真的
-真有趣
-That's a good one, huh?
-That is funny.

966
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,965
谢谢
Thank you.

967
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,374
你们找我来是想加我薪水吗?
So you guys here
to give me a raise or what?

968
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:12,252
他就是这样,老爱开玩笑
Oh, that's my guy,
always with the jokes.

969
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,422
对
Yeah.

970
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,621
对,没错
Yeah. Right.

971
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,925
不是的,我们很高兴收视率提升
No, really, we are very excited
about this year's rating increases.

972
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:27,126
我们希望下一季可以…
And we're hoping
that in the next quarter, we can--

973
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,770
-妈呀!
-怎么了?
-Oh, God.
-What's wrong?

974
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,439
没什么
Nothing. Nothing.

975
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,403
<font size=18 color=#4096d1>(狂喜-酥麻
天堂-暖身)

976
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,943
能不能?失陪一下
Could you excuse me?

977
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,607
-靠!
-抱歉,她有点…
-Shit.
-Sorry, she's....

978
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:46,411
-你在干嘛?
-找遥控器
-What are you doing?
-l'm looking for the remote.

979
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,784
-什么遥控器?
-就是那个…
-What remote?
-For the--

980
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,155
内裤
The underwear.

981
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:58,297
什么?你现在穿在身上?
What? You're wearing them now?

982
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:01,535
-你还好吧?
-还好
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

983
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,098
对
Yeah.

984
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:12,140
这道凉拌海鲜
真是好吃
This ceviche, it's so good.

985
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:16,316
可能是我尝过最美味的了
Quite possibly the best
l have ever tasted.

986
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,678
我要找主厨问秘诀,失陪一下
Yeah. l'm gonna ask the chef
for the recipe.

987
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,082
艾比,等等
Abby, hold on.

988
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,149
跟哈洛说说…
Tell Harold about
the new teaser campaign...

989
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,158
我们下周要上的新预告
...we're starting next week.
You're gonna love this.

990
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,797
当然,当然,当然
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

991
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:37,369
预告有十五秒
Well, they're 1 5 seconds...

992
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,104
每小时
整点播出
...every hour, on the hour.

993
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,576
对…
Yep. Yep, yep.

994
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,708
这预告真的是
They're so....

995
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,112
很…
So....

996
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,483
你跟他们说吧,麦克,你来说
You tell them, Mike.
You should tell them. Yes, yes.

997
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,816
对,你说
Yes, you tell them.

998
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,886
其实我很享受你说的方式
真精彩
Actually, l was really enjoying the way
you were telling them. lt was great.

999
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,963
你来说吧
You were-- You were telling them.

1000
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,368
凉拌海鲜有加什么料?
What's in ceviche?

1001
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,363
预告…
They're--

1002
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,407
突破以往尺度,大突破
They're unlike anything
you have ever felt.

1003
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,736
很棒
Amazing.

1004
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,469
内容是…
And they're of--

1005
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:20,078
麦克谈情场杀戮惨状
Of Mike telling an ugly truth...

1006
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,545
内容…
...and they are just so--

1007
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,516
创新大胆
So cutting-edge.

1008
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:27,884
太棒了!
So-- So fantastic. So fantastic!

1009
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,082
天哪,真的太…太赞了
Oh, God! Oh, it's so, so great!

1010
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:34,024
老天,你会爱死的
Oh, God. Yeah!
You're gonna love them.

1011
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,363
她还真是充满热忱,对吧?
Well, gotta love her
enthusiasm, right?

1012
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:48,538
我要
去一下化妆间
l'm gonna use the restroom,
if you'll excuse me.

1013
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,345
歹势,那是我的玩具
Sorry, buddy, that's my toy.

1014
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,586
你一开始就知道在他手上?
Did you know
he had it the whole time?

1015
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,950
不是一开始,是后来才知道
Not the whole time,
just part of the time.

1016
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,251
-我觉得该让你有全套享受
-真体贴
-l figured l should let you finish.
-How kind.

1017
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:08,125
感谢你带来今晚的高潮
So thanks for coming tonight.
To dinner.

1018
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,424
我是指…高潮迭起的演说
That kind of coming.

1019
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:17,261
对了,他喜欢你
柯林
He likes you, by the way. Colin.

1020
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,273
-我看得出来
-真的?
-l can tell.
-Really?

1021
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,445
-准备好了?
-好了
-We ready to go?
-Yeah.

1022
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,613
-我知道艾比已经暖好身了
-太好了
-l know Abby is.
-Great.

1023
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,372
走吧
Let's go.

1024
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,074
-保重,谢了
-好
-Take care. Thanks.
-Okay.

1025
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,927
-一切都很顺利
-当然
-Well, that went well, l think.
-Sure did.

1026
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,289
-对
-我们去喝一杯吧
-Yeah.
-Let's get a drink.

1027
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,930
鲍伯和哈洛…
Bob and Harold....

1028
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,163
-我的老天,给我的?
-天哪,柯林送花给我
-Oh, my God. For me?
-Oh, my God, he sent you flowers!

1029
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,390
你找到她再三方通话讨论
Okay. Just conference me
when you get a hold of her.

1030
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:51,958
好,掰
好了,热气球节就快到了
Okay, bye. All right, so we have
the balloon festival coming up...

1031
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,721
我觉得可以弄一段
...and for sweeps,
it might be nice to do a segment...

1032
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,558
男人脑袋跟热气球一样空空如也
...on how men are full of hot air.

1033
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,794
-好吧?不错吧?
-不好
-Right? lt's good, right?
-No.

1034
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,766
我们还是该在现场拍点什么
We should do some stuff
on location...

1035
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,804
因为你很擅长跟群众互动
...because you're great
when you're interacting with people.

1036
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,533
抱歉,你说我很擅长?
l'm sorry, did you just say l'm great?

1037
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,713
是啊,算吧
Yeah, you kind of are.

1038
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,384
你也一样
Back at you, babe.

1039
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,117
告诉我
So tell me this.

1040
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:22,917
纽约的大电视台怎么没来挖你?
Why hasn't some fancy
New York show stolen you away?

1041
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:26,118
我比较喜欢沙加缅度
Oh, l much prefer Sacramento
to New York.

1042
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,654
你是喜欢在小池子里当大鱼吧?
Come on. You just like
being a big fish in a little pond.

1043
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,630
不是
No. No.

1044
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:39,172
沙加缅度也不是小池子
这里比较像湖泊或河口
And Sacramento isn't really a pond,
it's more of a lake, or even an estuary.

1045
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,301
这里也是成家的好地方
And it's a great place
to raise a family.

1046
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,809
有很优的教育体系
Really good school system.

1047
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,743
公园干净,维护良好又安全
The parks are clean
and well-maintained and safe.

1048
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,613
这里的离婚率也比纽约低很多
And there's a much lower divorce rate
here than there is in New York.

1049
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,518
是啊
Yes, well....

1050
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:03,028
感谢上天柯林不会喜欢那种女人
Thank God Colin would never be into
a woman like that.

1051
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:06,668
对哦,我忘了,柯林水准很高
Oh, yeah, l forgot. Colin only likes
women of quality, huh?

1052
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:09,360
那是值得赞赏的特质,淫虫
That's a trait to be admired,
not mocked, man-whore.

1053
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:13,099
淫虫?为什么我是淫虫?
Man-whore?
Why am l a man-whore?

1054
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,709
我看过你跟果冻双胞胎一起
l've seen you with the Funbag Twins,
remember?

1055
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,003
看到我怎样?
Saw me what?

1056
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,376
看到我介绍她们给电台高层?
What, you saw me introduce them
to some network executives?

1057
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:24,485
她们想当演员
我凭什么扼杀她们的梦想?
They wanna be actresses, baby.
l mean, who am l to kill their dream?

1058
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:29,320
真好心,你是说你没睡过她们?
Such a generous man. You're telling
me you've never slept with them?

1059
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,358
-没有,我没那么说
-所以啦
-Well, no, l didn't say that.
-That's my point.

1060
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:35,053
男人或者该说是淫虫
Men, or man-whores...

1061
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:39,633
喜欢穿得少又爱吹老二的女人
...prefer women in slutty clothes
who suck lots of cock.

1062
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,736
每个男人都喜欢
Every man wants that.

1063
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,134
而且告诉你
那双胞胎之中我只上了识字的那个
And for your information, l only slept
with the one who could read.

1064
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,676
等一下,你刚刚说老二?
Wait a second,
did you just say ''cock''?

1065
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,180
对,我说了
Yes. Yes, l did.

1066
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,975
我可以说老二
这字眼又不属于你
l can say ''cock.''
You don't own the word. Cock.

1067
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,344
老二、老二、老二
Cock, cock, cock.

1068
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,383
好吧,我懂了
Okay, l got it.

1069
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:01,250
一周前你还受不了按摩棒的想法
A week ago, you were crying
at the thought of a vibrator.

1070
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,688
现在却满嘴老二这老二那的
Now you're ''cock this, cock that,''
cock, cock, cock.

1071
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:11,999
-你跟柯林睡过了,对吧?
-没有,没有
-You slept with Colin, didn't you?
-No. No.

1072
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,201
没有,我们要等到这个周末
We didn't.
We're saving that for this weekend.

1073
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,737
他要带我去太浩湖度假
He's taking me to Lake Tahoe.

1074
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,707
这样啊…
Well...

1075
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,079
敬彻底翻盘的假设
...here's to overturning
assumptions, huh?

1076
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:38,583
我是个品味偏颇的男人
而你是说话下流的浪荡女
l'm really a man of discriminating taste
and you're a foul-mouthed slut.

1077
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,729
谢谢
Thank you.

1078
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,092
结论就是
So there you have it.

1079
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:50,238
或是假设她是贞洁圣女
Never assume a girl is easy
or assume she's a prude.

1080
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,237
两者之间有许多层面
There are many layers in between.

1081
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,605
男人有责任揭开层层面纱
And it's your job, gentlemen,
to peel back those layers...

1082
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,748
确认你要搞定的是什么菜
...and figure out exactly what type
of woman you're dealing with.

1083
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:01,907
听来挺有启发性的
That sounded almost enlightened.

1084
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,576
因为一旦你拨开层层外衣
Because once you do peel back
those layers, my friends...

1085
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,053
-她草丛里的花蕾正等着你
-他恢复正常了
-...her lady garden awaits.
-And he's back.

1086
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:13,422
我相信你会想替她洒点肥料
And l'm pretty sure you're gonna
wanna fertilize that patch of petunias.

1087
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:16,621
谢了,麦克
Well, thanks, Mike.

1088
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,927
稍后气象主播将告诉我们…
Coming up after this message,
Javier tells us if your petunias...

1089
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,297
小花蕾这周末是否有雨水滋润
...are gonna see any rainfall
this weekend.

1090
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,803
希望我的会有
l sure hope mine do.

1091
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,134
我想回家,不过我们先看脚本吧
l wanna go home,
but let's go over the script.

1092
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,641
是啊,快点搞定它吧
Yeah, let's get it done really quickly.

1093
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,308
-你的花蕾令我兴奋,我要看它
-老公,想入我的花丛吗?
-l'm turned on with the layers.
-Want to see these layers?

1094
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,441
-他在这里
-你好
-There he is.
-Hey, what's up?

1095
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:37,585
好消息,你不会信的
Good news.
You're not gonna believe this.

1096
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,914
-什么?
-我帮你安排上《深夜夜现场》
-What?
-l got you on The Late Late Show...

1097
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,956
葛瑞格佛格森想请你当来宾
...with Craig Ferguson.
They want you as his guest.

1098
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,423
-《深夜夜现场》邀我上节目?
-对
-Ferguson wants me on his show?
-Yeah.

1099
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,926
-不会吧
-我没有骗你
-You're shitting me.
-l am not shitting you.

1100
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:50,463
-好耶!
-我们成功了!
-Oh, yeah.
-We made it.

1101
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,459
帅啊!
Yes!

1102
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,128
嗨,你是谁?
Hi. Who are you?

1103
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:57,328
这是瑞克
Oh, this is Rick.

1104
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,269
-他的经纪人
-对
-l'm his agent.
-Yeah.

1105
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,642
你什么时候有经纪人了?
又是什么时候…
Since when do you have an agent?
And since when is it okay...

1106
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,370
未经制片的许可
竟然可以去上《深夜现场》?
...to book Late Night
without the producer's approval?

1107
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,015
是《深夜夜现场》,两个夜
Actually, it's Late Late.
lt's two ''lates.''

1108
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:11,846
从他成为晨间电视当红名人开始
And since he became the hottest
personality on morning TV.

1109
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:16,013
-你看过这家伙的收视率吗?
-有,我看过
-Have you seen this guy's ratings?
-Yes. Yes, l have.

1110
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,159
总之你今晚上路,我安排好了
Yeah, okay.
Anyways, you leave tonight.

1111
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,487
-好
-都搞定了
-Okay.
-lt's all set.

1112
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:23,529
-这很酷吧?
-我们走吧
-How cool is this?
-Come on, let's go.

1113
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:24,893
我的妈呀!
Oh, my God!

1114
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,240
乔伊说你想见我?
Joy said you wanted to see me?

1115
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,568
我刚得知哥伦比亚电视旧金山台
l found out
that Mike's being offered a job...

1116
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,905
用两倍薪水挖麦克跳槽
...at a CBS affiliate in San Francisco
at twice the pay.

1117
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,012
上《深夜夜现场》就是试镜
Craig Ferguson is his audition.

1118
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,081
-不会吧
-正是
-You can't be serious.
-Oh, l'm serious.

1119
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,810
鲍伯和哈洛若得知此事
我们就死定了
lf Bob and Harold find out about this,
we're dead.

1120
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,649
我要你飞过去跟他谈
Now, l need you to fly out there
and talk him out of it.

1121
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,552
我这个周末要去太浩湖
l'm going to Lake Tahoe
this weekend.

1122
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,351
在他上场前,别让他知道你知情
Don't let him know that you know.

1123
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,223
让他去上节目,帮我们打知名度
Go ahead and let him do the show,
get us our publicity...

1124
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,263
之后再说服他签下三年合约
...and then convince him
that he needs to sign on with us...

1125
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:01,129
我们只能这么做了
...for the next three years.
That's all we can do.

1126
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,606
<font size=18 color=#4096d1>(世纪广场)

1127
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:13,179
我快到了,我要先设法拦截他
Stuart, l'm pulling up.
l'm gonna try to catch him.

1128
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,407
好,我再打给你
Okay. l'll call you back.

1129
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,350
谢谢
Thank you.

1130
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,546
你好,拍泻
Hello, little stupid penis face.

1131
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,884
要不是我,你还默默无名呢
You'd be on cable access
if it weren't for me.

1132
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:28,052
-听说你想跳槽到哥伦比亚
-你还好吧,小姐?
-Here you wanna move to CBS.
-ls everything okay, miss?

1133
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,461
没事,我只是在练习讲稿
Yes, l'm just--
l'm practicing my speech.

1134
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:36,970
艾比?你在这里干嘛?
我以为你去太浩湖了
Abby? What are you doing here?
l thought you were going to Tahoe.

1135
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,137
你就是离不开我,对吧?
You couldn't spend a day
without me.

1136
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:43,369
是啊,我渴求你的智慧和魅力
Yes. l just can't get enough
of your sparkling wit and charm.

1137
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,446
而且老大认为你需要制片
比我需要上床还重要
Stuart thought you needed a producer
more than l needed to get laid.

1138
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,413
我要登记住房,五分钟后出发
Come on, l gotta check in.
We leave in five minutes.

1139
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:54,813
-五分钟,滴答、滴答
-是,亲爱的
-Five minutes. Ticktock, ticktock.
-Yes, dear.

1140
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,217
我们先讨论受访问题吧
Okay, so let's go over
the pre-interview questions.

1141
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:03,730
抱歉害你没办法
跟小柯林一起共度周末
l'm sorry you didn't get to spend time
with little Colin this weekend.

1142
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,924
我说小柯林,不是说他尺寸小
And by ''little,''
l don't mean undersized...

1143
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,603
虽然我强力怀疑就是那样
...although l highly suspect
that's the case.

1144
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:12,569
柯林的尺寸,你现在想谈这个?
Colin's penis. That's what
you wanna talk about right now?

1145
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,743
因为我想也许我们该谈谈
Because l thought
we should talk about...

1146
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:16,969
你上节目要说什么
...what you're gonna say
on the show.

1147
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,909
对,好吧
Yeah. Okay.

1148
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,313
《真相挖挖哇》是怎么开始的?
So tell me, Mike,
how did The Ugly Truth start?

1149
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,510
亲爱的主持人
Well, Mr. lrish Craig Ferguson...

1150
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,983
我以前是业务员
...l had a sales job...

1151
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,852
常开车趴趴走
收听谈话节目
...where l was driving around a lot,
listening to talk radio.

1152
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,121
那时我开始叩应
后来我发现我比别人都聪明
l started calling in, and then l realized
l'm smarter than everybody else.

1153
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,026
问问我的制片艾比
就知道了
Just ask my producer, Abby.

1154
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,667
在她性生活还算满意时
她认为我是天才
She thinks l'm a genius on days
when she's not sexually frustrated.

1155
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:44,169
对,你的智慧丰富了大家的人生
Yes, thousands of lives
have been enriched by your wisdom.

1156
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,501
拜托,你是因为我才有了男朋友
Excuse me, lady, but you have
a boyfriend right now because of me.

1157
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,838
一开始也许是,后来是因为我
lt may have started because of you,
but it's lasted because of me.

1158
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:54,039
好啊,你又变回那个控制狂了
You're acting like your normal
control-freak psycho self again.

1159
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,443
我不是控制狂
l am not a control freak.

1160
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:58,711
你登记住房时有没有坚持…
When you checked into the hotel,
did you or did you not insist...

1161
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:03,517
要住七楼以上朝东的房间?
...on getting an eastern-facing room
on a floor not below 7?

1162
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:08,020
我喜欢起床看日出
l like rising with the sun, and a view.

1163
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:12,664
重点是柯林喜欢麦克改造的艾比
My point is, that Colin likes
the Mike version of Abby...

1164
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,358
不是原版的艾比
...not the Abby version of Abby.

1165
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,629
所以你别得了便宜还卖乖
So don't go
knocking my words of wisdom...

1166
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,467
少批评我的建议
...when you're living proof
that they work.

1167
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,311
我本来可以享受春宵的
l could be having sex right now.

1168
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,069
请往这边来
Right this way, please.

1169
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:28,545
兄弟,这太赞了
你即将站上全国性的电视台
Dude, this is awesome. You are
about to go on national television.

1170
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,343
这对我没啥帮助
Okay, this isn't helping, Rick.

1171
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,919
表现出平常的你就好
Just, you know,
do what you always do.

1172
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:37,821
-我平常都怎样?
-我不知道
-What do l always do?
-You-- l don't know, you....

1173
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,657
你用你的蠢主意娱乐数百万人
You entertain people
with your moronic ideas...

1174
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,854
他们也爱死你了
...and they love you for it.

1175
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,392
这是你对我说过最中听的话
That may be the nicest thing
you said to me.

1176
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:46,898
-不用客气
-接着…
-You're welcome.
-Next up...

1177
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,731
来现场挖男女真相的
...here to tell us the ugly truth
about men and women...

1178
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:52,840
就是查麦克,大家欢迎
...is Mike Chadway, everybody.
Mike Chadway.

1179
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,334
麦克…!
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1180
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,308
请上台来
Come on up.

1181
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,941
各位,你们好
Hey, how are you, folks?

1182
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,345
好,欢迎,麦克
All right, Mike, welcome.

1183
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:07,283
听着,男人,我们男人
我想我可以说我们男人
Now, listen. Men, we men,
l think l can say ''we men.''

1184
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,890
不分尺寸大小,全体男人
Not necessarily ''wee'' men,
but men of all sizes--

1185
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:13,061
-我懂、我懂
-我们一向不擅长…
-No, l get it. l get it.
-We're not known for our expertise...

1186
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,025
搞感情
...in matters of the heart.

1187
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:19,295
不过听说你有好玩的想法和理论
But l hear you have some
very interesting ideas and theories.

1188
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,970
对于那些渴望爱情的好人
What advice would you give
to the people out there...

1189
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:25,868
-你有何忠告?
-我的忠告就是…
-...that are looking for love?
-My advice would be:

1190
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,100
别谈恋爱
Don't do it.

1191
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:32,303
享受情欲就好
这样比较简单,麻烦也少
l mean, try to find lust instead.
lt's a lot easier and a lot less messy.

1192
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:37,748
肾亏,进补就好
心碎,就很难医了
Blue balls, they only last a few hours,
but a broken heart, that can last years.

1193
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:45,784
天哪,说吧,她是谁?
Goodness me. Tell me, then.
What's her name?

1194
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,457
谁?
Who?

1195
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,791
让你心碎的美眉,她一定很赞
The woman that screwed you up.
She must have been a doozy.

1196
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,601
就像我说的
浪女胜过美女
Well, like l said,
better a floozy than a doozy.

1197
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,509
我找一位李艾比
Hi. l was looking
for an Abby Richter.

1198
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:25,923
-搞定他没?他是我们的了?
-我正在努力
-Did you get him? Is he ours?
-l'm working on it.

1199
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,762
我要挂了
l gotta go.

1200
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,804
-瑞克人呢?
-我叫他回家
-Where's Rick?
-l sent him home.

1201
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:35,443
也许我们俩可以庆祝一下
给我来一点
l thought you and l could celebrate
on our own. Give me some of that.

1202
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:39,142
我们到底要庆祝什么?
And what exactly
are we celebrating?

1203
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:42,044
《深夜夜现场》啊,我上了这节目
Hello? Craig Ferguson?
l was just on it.

1204
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,014
也许你看到了
l mean, maybe you saw it?

1205
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,447
我听说哥伦比亚的价码了
l heard about the offer from CBS.

1206
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,555
那么也许你也听说我拒绝了
Well, then maybe you heard
l turned it down.

1207
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:53,686
真的?
You did?

1208
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,522
为什么?
Why?

1209
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,956
我外甥,琼纳
Jonah.

1210
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,533
他需要我陪着他
You know, he needs me around.

1211
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:05,002
我也许不是模范父亲的榜样
l may not be the best father figure
out there...

1212
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,037
但他只有我
...but l'm the only one he's got.

1213
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,906
我不想在旧金山当个半调子
And l don't wanna half-ass it
all the way from San Francisco.

1214
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:14,139
我想这是个很好的决定
Well, l think that's
a very good decision.

1215
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,578
谢谢
Thank you.

1216
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,877
我们别谈工作了
Now, can we stop
talking about work...

1217
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:22,990
放轻松喝一杯?
...and maybe relax and drink, enjoy?

1218
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,750
天哪
God.

1219
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,388
谈谈那个美眉吧
Tell me about the doozy.

1220
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,523
就是让你心碎的那个
You know,
the woman who broke your heart.

1221
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,099
你根本是想毁了我的好心情
You are just totally
trying to kill my buzz.

1222
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:37,261
我没有,我是对你的过去感兴趣
No, l'm not. l'm just interested
in what makes you you.

1223
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,766
就讲给你听吧
Well, for your information...

1224
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,447
不只一个
...it was more than just one.

1225
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:49,015
可以列队游行了
lt was more like a parade.

1226
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:53,347
依赖妹、不忠妹
Codependent girls, unfaithful girls...

1227
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:57,925
忧郁妹、自恋妹、肤浅妹
...depressed girls,
narcissistic girls, phony girls.

1228
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,290
还有根本不爱我的妹
Girls who, it turned out,
didn't actually like me.

1229
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,626
到三十岁那年
我发现…
By the time l hit 30, l realized that...

1230
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,268
如果不明白没有真爱
...you can only have
so many lousy relationships...

1231
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,598
就只会不断地承受打击
...before you figure out
there's no such thing as a good one.

1232
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:15,641
拜托,你不会真的相信
世上没有真爱吧
You can't really believe there's
no such thing as a good relationship.

1233
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,203
我完全相信
To my very core.

1234
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,409
你好,要来点什么吗?
Hello. Can l get you something?

1235
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,915
-请给我一杯那个
-好的
-l'll have one of those, please.
-A mojito. Sure.

1236
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,417
-还要别的吗?
-一杯水
-Would you like anything else?
-Yeah, some water.

1237
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,988
好,要纯水还是气泡水?
Okay, would you like
still or sparkling?

1238
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:31,625
-自来水就好,谢谢
-好的
-Tap water's great. Thanks.
-Tap. All right.

1239
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,494
干嘛?
What?

1240
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:35,857
怎样?
What?

1241
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,033
都一样不是吗?
lt's the exact same thing, isn't it?

1242
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,830
我也这么听说过
So l've been told.

1243
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:47,503
来,跳舞吧
Come on, let's dance.

1244
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,940
我是认真的
No, l'm serious.

1245
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,978
你不是只会跳抽筋舞吧
l've seen your spazzy dance,
now l wanna see the real thing.

1246
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:56,674
-不行,我不会跳那种舞
-我会,会一点
-No, really. l can't dance like that.
-l can. Well, kind of.

1247
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,355
麦克,不要
Oh, Mike, no.

1248
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,560
不要啦
No.

1249
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:39,954
我们明天搭早班机,该走了
We have an early flight tomorrow.
We should go.

1250
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,721
是啊,我们该走了
Yeah. We should go.

1251
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:20,223
车子明早八点在楼下等
So the car is gonna pick us up
downstairs tomorrow at 8.

1252
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,398
-要我叫你起床吗?
-我会请饭店叫床
-Do you want me to call you?
-No, l'll get a wake-up call.

1253
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,692
-是啊,好主意
-对
-Oh, yeah, good idea.
-Yeah.

1254
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:32,335
-我今晚过的很愉快
-我也是
-l had a really good time tonight.
-Me too.

1255
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,008
对
Yeah.

1256
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,014
-我的楼层到了
-对
-My floor.
-Yeah.

1257
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,312
-明天见
-八点
-See you tomorrow.
-Eight o'clock.

1258
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,353
八点
Eight o'clock.

1259
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,918
-晚安
-晚安
-Good night.
-Good night.

1260
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,427
-晚安
-是啊,晚安
-Good night.
-Yeah, good night.

1261
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,226
-真愉快
-对
-A lot of fun. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1262
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:17,945
我想
l guess--

1263
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,519
我想我该走了吧?
l guess l should go, huh?

1264
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,246
是啊
Yeah.

1265
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,783
晚安
Good night.

1266
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,648
那是怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

1267
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,882
我为什么会想再来一次?
Why do l wanna do it again?

1268
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:07,728
-想念我吗?
-柯林
-Miss me?
-Colin.

1269
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,928
-你在等别人吗?
-没有
-You were expecting someone else?
-No.

1270
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:16,907
既然你不能来太浩湖
我就决定来找你
Since you couldn't come to
Lake Tahoe, l decided to come to you.

1271
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:19,945
-你怎么知道我在这里?
-乔伊告诉我的
-How did you know l was here?
-Joy told me.

1272
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:24,346
我开始在想
我们本来要在那里做的事…
l just started thinking about all the
stuff we were going to do there, and l--

1273
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,545
-过来
-我等不下去了
Come here.
--decided l couldn't wait.

1274
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:29,685
-喝点香槟?
-好
-A little champagne?
-Yeah.

1275
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,223
太好了
Great.

1276
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:34,759
真高兴能来这里
So happy to be here. Oh, yes.

1277
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:38,626
-怎么了?
-没什么,你吓了我一跳
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. You just surprised me.

1278
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:42,098
-你说过你很随性
-是啊
-You told me you were spontaneous.
-Yes, l did.

1279
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:46,968
我上来的时候带了点东西
你会喜欢的
Have a little something else on its way
up for you. You are going to love it.

1280
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,239
天哪,真是的
喷得真快啊
Let me tell you,
it comes out so fast, right?

1281
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,348
看来我们很快就会脱光光了
Oh, wow, l guess we have to
get naked sooner than l thought.

1282
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,079
-我帮你拿毛巾
-好
-l'll get you a towel.
-Okay.

1283
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,255
艾比,我…
Abby, l....

1284
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:17,764
艾比,我真的想再来一次
不只是一夜情
Abby, l really, really wanna do that
again, and not just tonight.

1285
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,463
靠!
Fuck.

1286
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,568
靠、靠…
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1287
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,642
勇敢一点,你行的
Man up, Chadway.
Come on, you can do this.

1288
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:37,318
嘿,你不是客房服务
Hey-- Hey. You're not room service.

1289
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,756
-你好吗?
-嘿
-How you doing, man?
-Hey.

1290
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:42,157
真高兴见到你
Hey. Good to see you. l--

1291
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:47,324
我是来跟艾比说班机改了时间
l just came by to tell Abby
about the change in our flight time...

1292
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:50,471
不过我可以晚点再来
...but l can come by later.

1293
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,139
-嗨
-嘿
-Hi.
-Hey.

1294
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:55,266
你来这干嘛?
What are you doing here?

1295
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,877
班机改时间了
Flight's changed.

1296
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,674
早上八点
Eight o'clock in the morning.

1297
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,146
我告诉过你了?
l told you that already?

1298
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,417
真长的一天,大日子
l'm so-- Long day, big day.

1299
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,685
我走了
Okay, l'll just leave now.

1300
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,201
麦克,麦克
Mike. Mike.

1301
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,967
等等
Hey, wait.

1302
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,834
他是来给我惊喜的
He came to surprise me. l....

1303
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:31,312
-是啊,真方便啊
-不…
-Hey, how convenient.
-No, l--

1304
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:33,538
我以为来敲门的人是你
l thought it was you at the door.

1305
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,377
我想人都是可替换的对吧?
Well, l guess we're all
interchangeable.

1306
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,649
我把你调教得很好
l taught you well.

1307
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:42,653
也许你还能代我主持
Hey, maybe you could
even host the show.

1308
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,324
告诉我电梯里发生了什么事
Tell me what happened
in the elevator.

1309
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,894
我该叫柯林走吗?
Should l tell Colin to go?

1310
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,465
不
No.

1311
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,842
何必现在撤退?
No, why pull up anchor now?

1312
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:06,176
你那么努力才让他来到这里
l mean, you worked damn hard
to get him here.

1313
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,347
就这样?你要说的就这些?
And that's it?
That's all you have to say?

1314
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,483
你要我说什么?
What do you want me to say?

1315
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,791
挖出来的真相还真残酷,是吗?
The truth is ugly, isn't it?

1316
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:23,263
这就是我一直想让你明白的事
That's what l've been
trying to tell you.

1317
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,531
回头见了
l'll see you.

1318
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,153
真对不起
Sorry about that.

1319
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:59,926
不会,真的,没关系
No. Honestly, no worries.

1320
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,228
过来
Just come here.

1321
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:06,067
今晚属于我们
Listen, the rest of the night is ours.

1322
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:10,474
敬无数浪漫的夜晚的开始
To the first of many
romantic evenings to come.

1323
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,777
是啊
Okay.

1324
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:25,351
是啊,柯林,你为什么喜欢我?
Yeah. Colin, why do you like me?

1325
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:34,268
你美丽
聪明
You're beautiful. You're smart.

1326
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,004
你…
You--

1327
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:38,467
从不乱批评
You never criticize.

1328
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:41,699
你从来不想掌控全局
You know what?
You never try to control the situation.

1329
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,276
我得说,这真令人神清气爽
And l've gotta say,
it's a breath of fresh air...

1330
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,846
因为我认得很多女人
...because l know so many women
who are total control freaks...

1331
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,277
根本是控制狂,超恐怖的
...and it's a nightmare.

1332
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:52,112
-我就爱你不是那样
-可是我是
-l just love that you're not like that.
-But l am.

1333
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:54,815
我就是那样
l am just like that.

1334
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,555
等等,这话什么意思?
Wait, what do you mean?

1335
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,953
这应该要先冰过
Well, this should be chilled.

1336
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:01,018
你很清楚
But you know that.

1337
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,062
听来很恐怖
And as horrible as it sounds...

1338
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,497
在你说话的同时,我都在盘算
...l was editing that speech
the entire time you were giving it.

1339
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:12,071
你喂我吃鱼子酱的时候
我感觉超差的
And the time you fed me caviar,
l was in physical pain.

1340
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,970
我讨厌被当成小孩喂食
l hate being fed like a toddler.

1341
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,873
我就是这样的控制狂
That's how much
of a control freak l am.

1342
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,048
不过我不能让你知道这些
But l couldn't show you
any of that, because...

1343
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,513
因为谁会爱这样的女人?
...who would love someone like that?

1344
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,714
没有人
No one.

1345
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:44,629
我很抱歉
l'm so sorry.

1346
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,008
你是个好对象,真的
You are a great guy, you really are.

1347
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:52,676
所以我必须告诉你,我不是我自己
Which is why l have to tell you
that l have not been myself.

1348
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,406
我们约会的每一刻都不是
Not for one second of the time
that we've been dating.

1349
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,080
那你是谁?
Then who have you been?

1350
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:03,885
某个猪头要我扮的美眉
The girl some idiot told me to be.

1351
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:32,984
早,佛雷
Morning, Freddy.

1352
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:35,921
你对他做了什么?
What did you do to him?

1353
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,888
我啥都没做,是他自己没搭上飞机
l didn't do anything.
He missed the flight all on his own.

1354
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,891
他今天早上辞职了
He quit this morning.

1355
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,896
哥伦比亚本地分台告诉我
说他们跟他谈妥交易了
l got a call from the local CBS affiliate
saying they'd closed a deal with him.

1356
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,625
高层震怒,到底怎么回事?
Corporate's having a shit fit.
What the hell happened?

1357
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:51,499
他辞职跑去本地对手台?
He quit to go
to one of our local competitors?

1358
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,003
我们不需要查麦克
We don't need Mike Chadway.

1359
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,403
半调子的山顶洞人到处都是
Halfwit troglodytes
are a dime a dozen.

1360
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:57,669
你最好没说错
You'd better be right.

1361
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,848
本周内要找人取代他,否则停播
Because you gotta find me
another one or else we're canceled.

1362
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,483
我今天之内就能找到
l'll find one by the end of the day.

1363
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:07,280
我是玩笑话啦,各位
Not really. l'm just--
That's just a joke, everybody.

1364
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,787
我竟然让自己对他有感觉
l can't believe l allowed myself
to feel for him.

1365
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:13,427
你有足够的感觉跟柯林分手
抱歉
Well, you felt enough something
to break up with Colin. l'm sorry.

1366
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,653
这些是查麦克的替代人选
Okay, here are the Mike Chadway
replacements.

1367
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:20,301
-行、不行、行、不行…差太多了
-差太多了,好
-Yes, no, yes, no, no, fuck no.
-''Fuck no.'' All right.

1368
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:23,266
新环境不错吧?
So, what do you think
of the new set?

1369
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:25,038
我喜欢
l love it.

1370
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,606

KS XP retained the copyright

1371
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:32,746
所以我们改了名称叫
《麦克疯》
...so we retitled you:
Morning Madness With Mike.

1372
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:35,471
我喜欢
Love it.

1373
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:39,347
-这是小裘,你的新制片
-嗨
-And this is Joe, your new producer.
-Hi.

1374
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:43,351
你知道我最中意你哪一点吗?
You know what l like
best about you, Joe?

1375
01:22:43,558 --> 01:22:45,890
我完全不想跟你嘿咻
ls l don't wanna
have sex with you at all.

1376
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,255
我真是如释重负
l'm relieved to hear that.

1377
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:20,421
我的脸怎样?太油了?
How's my face? ls it too shiny?

1378
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:24,086
哪边好看?右、左、正面
Which side is better?
Right, left, full frontal?

1379
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:28,491
都很帅
能不能再跑一次开场?
They're all great. Can we go over
your intro one more time?

1380
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:34,164
-我是马杰克,欢迎收看…
-《真相挖挖哇》
-''l'm Jack Magnum, and this is....''
-The Ugly Truth.

1381
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:38,512
好,去掉比枪的手势
Okay. Let's maybe lose
the gun thing.

1382
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:40,578
怎么?这是我的招牌动作
What? Gun's my signature move.

1383
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:43,342
除非枪枝协会买广告时段
Unless the NRA is paying
your mortgage this month...

1384
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,109
否则别比枪了
...l say lose the effing gun.

1385
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:49,084
好,倒数五、四、三…
All right,
we're live in five, four, three....

1386
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,587
二、一
Two, one.

1387
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:53,852
-这家伙行吗?
-最好是行
-Think this guy's any good?
-He better be.

1388
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:58,897
我是马杰克
欢迎收看《真相挖挖哇》
I'm Jack Magnum,
and this is The Ugly Truth.

1389
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,263
-和平
-天哪!怎么会走政治路线?
-Peace.
-Oh, Jesus. He's going political.

1390
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,938
好,我们要问气球驾驶几个问题
We'll do a couple questions
with the balloon pilot...

1391
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,405
情侣多常在上面嘿咻,然后结尾
...about how often couples get it on
in-flight, and then we're out.

1392
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,134
了解
Got it.

1393
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:13,707
-快看,你的接班人上了
-马杰克
-Check it out. Your replacement's on.
-Jack Magnum.

1394
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:15,382
-我的什么?
-还好吗?
-My what?
-How's it going, Jack?

1395
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:16,948
你的接班人
Your replacement?

1396
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:20,246
你们看节目是想学习怎么把妹
Most of you are watching this show
so you can learn how to get chicks.

1397
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:24,084
我向各位保证
你们找对人了
Well, let me assure you,
you're in good hands.

1398
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:25,782
你们眼前的人
You're looking at a guy...

1399
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:30,328
曾经跟超过一百三十七个妹嘿咻过
...who personally has had sex
with over 1 3 7 women.

1400
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:31,794
她们大多神智清楚
Most of them conscious.

1401
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:37,161
-这可好玩了
-我们在热气球节现场
-This is beautiful.
-Now, we're at the balloon festival...

1402
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,806
我本该说男人脑袋跟气球一样空
...and l'm supposed to be telling you
about how men are full of hot air.

1403
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:44,240
不过我们都知道,女人脑袋才空
But l think we all know,
it's the ladies that are full of crap.

1404
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,938
当她说不
并不代表她真的不要
Just because she says no,
doesn't mean she means no.

1405
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:52,786
这样的话,我嘿咻记录就只剩
九十个了
lf that were the case,
l'd have only 90 women--

1406
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:55,989
-好吧
-搞什么鬼?
-Okay. All right.
-What the hell?

1407
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:57,818
你有没有…
Did she--?

1408
01:24:58,626 --> 01:24:59,684
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

1409
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:03,420
看来我们碰上一些技术问题
lt looks like we're experiencing
some technical difficulty.

1410
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,997
是啊,红酒节的现场…
Yeah, when you have
a wine festival....

1411
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,998
换我来
Okay, l got it.

1412
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:11,100
-嗨
-播报继续
-Hi.
-We're back.

1413
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:12,936
很抱歉
l'm sorry...

1414
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:17,441
不过马杰克不再主持
《真相挖挖哇》节目
...but Jack Magnum will no longer
be able to do The Ugly Truth.

1415
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:19,947
这没啥大不了的
Which should really
come as no surprise...

1416
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:23,447
因为男人都不可靠
...because men
are completely unreliable.

1417
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,551
她在干嘛?
What is she doing?

1418
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:29,280
喂?哈洛?是的
我知道,我们正在修理
Yes? Yes, Harold? Yes. Yes, l know.
We're fixing it.

1419
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,981
就拿查麦克来说吧
Take Mike Chadway, for instance.

1420
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:34,127
他一声不吭的就不干了
He up and quit the show
without so much as a word.

1421
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:37,059
你以为你知道男人会怎么做
You think you know what men
are gonna do, you think you know...

1422
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:38,630
你以为你知道男人想怎么做
...what men want to do.

1423
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,664
不过当那一刻来临
But when it comes down
to that moment...

1424
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:44,361
那个需要他们勇往直前
采取行动时
...where they actually need to step up
and, I don't know, make a move...

1425
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:45,561
他们却龟缩落跑了
...they chicken out.

1426
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,604
-我受够了
-你去哪?
-l am all over this.
-Where are you going?

1427
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,972
-就快进现场直播了
-很赞吧?
-We're live in two.
-lt's going great, isn't it?

1428
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,581
我们从小在小说上看到
The big, strong, brave men
that we've all been reading about...

1429
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,843
甚至在电影里看到的
...in novels and watching in movies
since we were 9 years old...

1430
01:25:59,053 --> 01:26:01,487
那些高大强壮威猛的男人?
都是假的,根本不存在
...that's a fallacy. They don't exist.

1431
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:04,749
男人既不强壮也不威猛
Men are not strong.
Men are not brave.

1432
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,722
男人胆小如鼠
Men are afraid.

1433
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:10,056
是节目效果,走麻辣呛声风
lt's all part of the show. lt's an
Andy Kaufman thing we're doing.

1434
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:15,834
就算他们在饭店电梯里有机会
Even if they have a moment
in a hotel elevator...

1435
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:19,664
就算气氛浪漫又有搞头
...and it's totally romantic
and full of potential...

1436
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:23,233
男人还是无法面对
...men are incapable of copping to it.

1437
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,469
因为…为什么?
Because why?

1438
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,379
男人很脆弱
Men are weak.

1439
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:31,575
让我来告诉你们女人的真面目吧
Let me tell you something
about women.

1440
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,514
-嘿
-女人让我们相信
-Hey.
-Woman would have us believe...

1441
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:38,556
她们是受害者
说我们喜欢敲碎她们的心
...that they are the victims.
That we break their hearts for sport.

1442
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,250
-我以为他不干了
-胡扯
-l thought he quit.
-That's crap.

1443
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:42,190
我就说我们会把他弄回来
See? l told you we'd get him back.

1444
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:46,527
她们说只要真爱
可是却用条件来筛选对象
They say they want true love,
but all they want is a checklist.

1445
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:50,226
他完美吗?他帅吗?
他是不是医生?
ls he perfect? ls he handsome?
ls he a doctor?

1446
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,065
符合条件的男人们
For you men who fit the criteria...

1447
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,935
别傻了
因为她们不是跟你睡
...don't kid yourselves,
they're not sleeping with you.

1448
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:59,944
她们是跟精密算计的选择睡
They're sleeping with a carefully
calculated set of venal choices.

1449
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:03,049
钱比人重要,外表比内在重要
Money over substance,
looks over soul.

1450
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:05,048
家世比人品重要
Polish over principles.

1451
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,154
任何行动,不论真实或浪漫
No gesture,
no matter how real or romantic...

1452
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:12,156
都比不上符合标准的合格证书
...will ever compensate for a really
impressive list of credentials.

1453
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,828
因为男人只会
This coming from a man
who's never made a gesture...

1454
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,325
采取这个行动
...other than this one.

1455
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,464
所以电梯里的事不算罗?
Oh, so the elevator
wasn't a gesture?

1456
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,634
电梯里发生的是激情
The elevator
was a moment of passion...

1457
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,895
接着很明显地是你不知所措
...followed by a moment of panic
on your part, apparently.

1458
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:28,474
-不知所措?我去了你房间
-对,然后你还是落跑了
-Panic? l came by your room.
-Yes, and then you ran away.

1459
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:30,109
那不是不知所措,宝贝
That wasn't panic, sweetheart.

1460
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,108
是不想跟你…
That was an unwillingness
to compete...

1461
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,907
床上的标准情人比拼
...with the walking checklist
that was in your bed.

1462
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,674
你应该感谢我
You should be thanking me.

1463
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,715
还有十秒
We got 1 0 seconds.

1464
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,911
准备升天了?
Are we ready to soar
up, up and away?

1465
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:43,818
各位,这就是挖出来的真相
Well, there you have it, folks.
That's the ugly truth.

1466
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:45,652
脚踏两条船的女人
A girl in heat for two guys...

1467
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,987
永远都会选条件较好的那个
...will choose the one
with the better resume.

1468
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:49,254
鬼扯
That is bullsh--

1469
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,924
现场结束
And we're out.

1470
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:57,367
天哪,我好恨你
我在直播现场咒骂
God. l hate you so much,
l just swore on live television.

1471
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,630
不,你是恨自己太肤浅
No, you hate yourself
for being so shallow.

1472
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,099
-升天罗
-我们要去哪?
-Off we go.
-Where are we going?

1473
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,938
我才不跟你一起去
l'm not going anywhere with you.

1474
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:10,715
-真吓人啊,你想落跑!
-我可不建议你这么做
-Well, that's a shocker, you're bailing.
-l wouldn't recommend that.

1475
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,510
空中摄影机继续拍
Keep rolling on the onboard camera.

1476
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:20,157
你干嘛?
天哪,你是怎么回事?
What are you doing?
God, what is wrong with you?

1477
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:26,565
他们不知道他们上镜了,对吧?
They don't even know
they're on the air, do they?

1478
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:29,066
有办法告诉他们吗?
ls there any way to tell them
they're on the air?

1479
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,330
-没有
-他们会爆粗口的
-Nope.
-Oh, they're gonna curse. l know it.

1480
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,052
有谁想喝香槟?
So who wants champagne?

1481
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:51,248
我知道了,我有个好主意
Oh, l know. l got a great idea.

1482
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:53,757
干脆告诉我你跟柯林…
Why don't we pass the time
with you telling me...

1483
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:56,828
在洛杉矶的嘿咻高潮
好杀时间
...how much fun you and Colin had
having sex in Los Angeles?

1484
01:28:57,031 --> 01:28:59,397
我在洛杉矶跟他分手了,猪头
l broke up with Colin in Los Angeles,
you jackass.

1485
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,830
左手边可以看到内华达山脉
On our left,
you'll see the High Sierras....

1486
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:04,766
-什么?
-是啊,这你就有兴趣了
-What?
-Oh, yeah. That's got your interest.

1487
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:07,236
你别以为可以继续那天的事
lf you think we're gonna finish
what we started...

1488
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:09,740
你的机会已经没了
...you're out of your mind.
You lost your chance.

1489
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,344
拜托,你根本没给过我机会
Oh, come on.
l never had a chance with you.

1490
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:15,675
右边这里,可以看到沙加缅度河
And to our right here, you'll see
the lovely Sacramento River...

1491
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:18,374
在双色的地形中蜿蜒前进
...winding its way
through the dichromatic landscape.

1492
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,520
拜托你闭嘴好吗?谢谢
Could you please stop talking?
Thank you.

1493
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:23,190
你说的对,我暂时丧失判断力
You're right. l had a momentary
lapse in judgment...

1494
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,258
以为你其实很不错,但显然不是
...when l thought you were
more than you are, but you aren't.

1495
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,190
是吗?这话什么意思?
Oh, yeah?
Well, what does that mean?

Oh, for God's sakes,
there's the first one.

是啊,是很吓人,太恐怖了
Yeah, it is scary. lt's terrifying.

我不是疯女人
I am not a psycho.

1502
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,370
爱?
Love?

1503
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:51,109
我刚刚说我爱你
而你却只听到疯女人
l just told you that l loved you,
and all you heard was ''psycho.''

我刚刚才告诉你我爱上了你
Yet again,
l just told you l'm in love with you...

1508
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:08,493
你却站在这里给我上语文课
...and you're standing here
giving me a vocabulary lesson.

1509
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:21,941
你爱我
You're in love with me.

为什么?
Why?

1511
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:28,679
你彻底问倒我了
Beats the shit out of me...

01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:30,152
但我就是爱
...but l am.

喔,麦克
Oh, Mike.

你好强

-真的?
-天哪!
-Really?
-Oh, God!

01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:20,237
我真有那么厉害?
Am l really that good?

1518
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,068
还是…
Or are you--?

01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,368
你是装的?
Are you just faking it?

你永远不会知道
You'll never know.
