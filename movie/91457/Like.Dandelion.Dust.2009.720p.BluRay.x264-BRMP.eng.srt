1
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,330
Police. Is anybody home?

2
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,601
Sir, could you step to the door?

3
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,946
- Yeah.
- Sir, we received a 911 call.

4
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,349
Is everything okay?

5
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,820
My wife was upset. She might have called.

6
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,949
- Everything's fine now.
- Sir, could you open the door?

7
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,497
What's your name, sir?

8
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,863
It's Porter. Rip Porter.

9
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,632
Mr. Porter, could you step inside?

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,940
Go ahead and have a seat, sir.

11
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,081
Mr. Porter, is your wife here?

12
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,886
I don't know. She might be upstairs.

13
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,416
Wen. Wendy!

14
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,993
Mrs. Porter? Police.

15
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,092
Wendy?

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,095
Mrs. Porter? Police officer.

17
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,002
Mrs. Porter.

18
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,174
Ma'am, are you all right?

19
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,240
- Wen!
- Stop resisting, sir.

20
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,889
Get off! Get off!

21
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,030
Wendy.

22
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,391
Ah.

23
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,432
Just to the right over there.

24
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,445
There you go. Perfect.

25
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,573
See, you want to go
right down the middle of this channel.

26
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,674
Can I drive by myself, Daddy?

27
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,185
You can drive when we
get outside of the marina. Okay, bud?

28
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,744
Okay.

29
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,951
- Hey, Daddy?
- Yep.

30
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,691
Am I just a rookie at this?

31
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,755
What'd you say? A rookie?

32
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,801
- That's a big boat, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,137
It's, like, 200feet.

34
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,336
Think we're gonna see any fish?

35
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,245
I could give you a mask, throw you
in the water. You'd see plenty of fish.

36
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,248
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,983
I love you, boy.

38
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,506
Hey, Joey. Should I sing Mommy a tune?
Yeah?

39
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,703
Yes, please sing a tune, sweetheart.

40
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,246
# Molly #

41
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,044
How's that for an intro?

42
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,642
It'd be good if you knew
a few more chords.

43
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,051
Look, Mommy.

44
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,386
What is this? Is this your story?

45
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,516
Yep.

46
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,084
Sweetie, this is beautiful.

47
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,152
Will you help me with the words?

48
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,826
Um, of course, but not right now
because it's time for bed.

49
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,063
But I have to finish my story.

50
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,265
Nice try, kiddo. Go to bed.
Listen to your mama.

51
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,330
Tomorrow, you can finish your story.

52
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,036
Right now it is 7:00,
and you haven't even had a bath yet.

53
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,601
Get Mr. Growls.

54
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,614
- Will you sing a song first?
- A song?

55
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,508
- Daddy, don't do it.
- Joey.

56
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,420
- Don't do it, Daddy. - This is a little
song I wrote for you about bedtime.

57
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh, no! He did it!

58
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,585
# Joey, Joey, Joey
better get his butt to bed #

59
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,258
# Or Daddy, Daddy, Daddy's
gonna drop him on his head #

60
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,665
- # Come on #
- Whoa, Daddy.

61
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,670
Kiss your son good night.

62
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,728
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night. Night, Mama.

63
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,366
- See you in a second.
- Okay. You win.

64
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,934
That's right, Son. Daddy always wins.

65
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,779
I just want you to know...

66
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,406
You did the right thing.

67
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,778
Okay?

68
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:23,054
# I was making a living#

69
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,857
Okay.

70
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,263
# And I forgot to live#

71
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,302
# I've lost you forever#

72
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,537
Father Logan, when I was leaving today-

73
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,547
He wrote down his number, and...

74
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,052
He said we can call him
anytime we need him if we need anything.

75
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,385
So, I just want-
I want you to- I want you to take that.

76
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,687
I want you to-
I want you to hold on to it.

77
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,524
And if, you know, we need to call him...

78
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,690
You just give it to me-

79
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,326
and I'll call him.

80
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,393
That okay?

81
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,705
Okay.

82
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,274
Last night was so terrifying.

83
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,506
I was afraid that I would come out...

84
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,948
And... you wouldn't be there...

85
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,077
That I'd be alone, you know.

86
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,281
Oh, baby.

87
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,517
I told you I'd be there.

88
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,761
Thank you.

89
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,099
- I love this.
- Yeah?

90
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,901
- Little greasy.
- No.

91
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,635
Is that it?

92
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,783
Is there anything you-
anyplace you want to go? Anything-

93
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,946
You know what I'd really like to do,
actually, is go to a craft store.

94
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,251
You're sweet.

95
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,257
Get some yarn and some beads?

96
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,827
I love your hair like that.

97
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,793
Thanks. It's a little darker.

98
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,359
Little bit.

99
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,072
That's neat.

100
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,391
- Come on.
- All right, Joey.

101
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,957
Come on, Joey. Put it right in the glove.

102
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,867
- Strike.
- Stee-rike!

103
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,598
- Yeah.
- Daddy!

104
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,973
- Very nice.
- Dad. Dad, throw it here.

105
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,309
- All right. Pop-up.
- I got it.

106
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,941
Can you see? Look there, little guy.

107
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,179
Oops! Hey.

108
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,814
Ready? Here I go.

109
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,689
- Want some chicken?
- I'm full, honey.

110
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,525
- Are you sure?
- Enough with the meat.

111
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,327
- No, no. Bring it on.
- So how's business, Bill?

112
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,390
Uh, well, you know, it'll pick up.

113
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,130
Well, my offer stilI stands.
You know that.

114
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,762
I know. Thank you. Appreciate it.

115
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,535
Why don't you let Jack help you out, Bill?
It'd be an investment for us.

116
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,735
Look, we're so good. Thank you.

117
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,905
- Have you thought about my offer?
- What's that?

118
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:32,142
Beth wants to start taking Joey
to church with them.

119
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,151
Really?

120
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,915
Don't you think it's important
that he's raised with good values?

121
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,014
- Sweetheart?
- Excuse me. Need anything?

122
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,559
I got some rib eye coming next.
I'll be right back.

123
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,099
Okay, thanks. Sounds good.

124
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,631
I know. I know.

125
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,603
Hey, buddy.

126
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,749
Hey, buddy, come here. Come on.

127
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,810
Come here.
Hey, look at you! Hey, Camper.

128
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,878
- How you doing?
- Your daddy's home!

129
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,392
Your daddy's home, Camper.

130
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,193
- Honey!
- Phew.

131
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,696
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

132
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,289
- He bit you in the face.
- No, it's-

133
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,460
- Camper, you bad dog!
- He's just doin' his job.

134
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,629
I知 so sorry.
Let's get you cleaned up.

135
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,271
I can't believe that.

136
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,676
What a way to come home, huh?

137
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,406
You know, we're gonna have
two salaries coming in.

138
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,542
We could fix things up a bit here.

139
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,943
- That would be great.
- Yeah.

140
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,089
You know, baby, I was thinking
that once I get settled in...

141
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,720
We save a bit of money...

142
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:57,327
Um, we could start trying again.

143
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,892
You know?

144
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,929
What do you think?

145
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,512
Do you want to start a family?

146
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,877
Let's start a family.

147
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,438
- Really?
- Yeah.

148
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,817
It壇 be that new life we talked about.

149
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,155
He could be the new me.

150
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,719
You want a boy?

151
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,286
Yeah.

152
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,491
I think every man wants a son, right?

153
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,439
Come on. Run, Joey. Run!

154
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,975
It's cold.

155
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,847
I telI you, I should get your sister
to come over more often.

156
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,853
Get some dishes done around here.

157
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,685
That's funny.

158
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,716
- I'm just sick of it.
- What's the big deal? Just let him go to church.

159
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,424
Him going or not going is not the issue.
He's our son.

160
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,490
- She has no right.
- Sweetie. Hey.

161
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,900
She's just jealous.

162
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,940
You got all the looks, the talent.

163
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,498
You got me.

164
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,601
- It's perfectly understandable.
- Really?

165
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,237
I知 glad you think this is amusing,
because I don't.

166
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,986
R & B ]
- Rip. What's up, man? How are you?

167
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,924
Yo, Rip.

168
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,721
Who's that?

169
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,361
- This was a great night.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,525
You look like an angel.

171
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,904
Rip, I need to talk to you
about something.

172
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,304
Yeah?

173
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,166
What?

174
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,307
What is it, baby?

175
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,149
Um-

176
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,212
Whatever it is, it's okay.
You can tell me, you know.

177
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,916
After you went away...

178
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,657
It was so hard for me, Rip.

179
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,666
It was just so hard.

180
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,759
- I know. Honey, I'm sorry.
- No.

181
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,904
I couldn't even find a job at first,
and then, um-

182
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,240
then I-I-

183
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,510
I found out I was pregnant.

184
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,485
You what?

185
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,182
And I didn't want to have an abortion,
because it was-

186
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,590
It was a part of you and me, Rip.

187
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,797
But I just, uh-

188
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,595
I just kept thinking...

189
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,102
About how hard my childhood was...

190
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,695
With- with my father...

191
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,605
And how hard yours was...

192
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:29,613
And with how things were
between you and me at that time.

193
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,943
I just thought it was better for-

194
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,587
So, my mother, she signed for you.

195
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,661
I gave-
I gave the baby up for adoption.

196
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,394
I gave him away.

197
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,435
Please say something, Rip.

198
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,006
You said "him. "

199
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,712
You said "him. " It was a boy?

200
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,321
I gave him away.

201
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,053
I- I gave away our boy.

202
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,927
I知- I'm so sorry.

203
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,666
This is okay.

204
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:33,409
I couldn't have been a father, honey-
not then, not the man I was then.

205
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,176
You don't have to say that, sweetheart.

206
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,345
Honey, don't- don't cry.

207
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,945
Baby, we gotta get him back.

208
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,819
We can't.

209
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,194
- We gave him away.
- No.

210
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,961
Baby, I didn't sign anything.
I didn't sign anything.

211
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,870
We need to get our son back.

212
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,034
Okay? I'm gonna make this right for you.

213
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,109
Okay? Come here.
Come here.

214
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,681
- It's okay.
- Oh.

215
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,740
It's okay. All right?

216
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,055
We'll get him back.

217
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,016
Gotta go!
I gotta go! I gotta go!

218
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,326
Careful, sweetie.
You have the eggs.

219
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,332
- Why'd you give me the eggs?
- 'Cause it was the lightest one.

220
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,961
- I gotta pee!
- Okay. Remember to put the toilet seat down.

221
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,699
Put it up first, and then put it down.

222
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,765
I know how to use the toilet, Mommy.

223
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,885
This is Alyson Bower
of the Ohio Department of Child Services.

224
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,943
I'm calling for Mr. and Mrs. -

225
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,448
Your Honor I'd just like to point out..

226
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,452
That this child is in private school...

227
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,454
And he's very well-adjusted.

228
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,151
Whereas, these people, the birth parents,
have no parental experience.

229
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,026
I appreciate it, Mrs. Bower,
but that doesn't change the forgery.

230
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,202
Have a seat.

231
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,903
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Porter?

232
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,775
Who signed these papers?

233
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,341
Well, I assumed my husband did.

234
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,086
- I can explain, Your Honor-
- I wasn't talking to you.

235
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,579
Mrs. Porter.

236
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,689
After Rip was put away...

237
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,854
I decided to adopt out the baby.

238
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,195
And so I took the papers to the prison...

239
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,061
But because Rip and I
weren't on speaking terms...

240
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,629
I gave them to a guard to give to him...

241
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:20,542
And someone on the inside
must have signed his name.

242
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,707
Let's I find out who did sign those papers,
he's going to the same prison you did.

243
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,272
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,909
You're going to tell me...

245
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,854
That you didn't know
about the pregnancy or the adoption?

246
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:35,085
No, sir, not until a couple weeks ago.

247
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,888
And now you want to be a father?

248
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,023
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,762
Before I was incarcerated,
I was a very different man-

250
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:49,466
certainly not fit to be
a husband or a father.

251
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,709
And, uh, my alcoholism...

252
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,110
Is a progressive illness...

253
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,308
And healing is lifelong.

254
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:05,277
And I've spent the last seven years
rehabilitating.

255
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,814
And the one thing
that I've held on to, sir...

256
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,623
Is- is my hope.

257
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:15,188
My hope for a family...

258
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:20,770
To repair the damage that I've done...

259
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,807
And my desire to be a father.

260
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,469
She's been in court all day?
What's going on?

261
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,106
Just let me try to talk to her.

262
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,021
Allyson Bower.
Jack Campbell returning your call.

263
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,622
What kind of situation?

264
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,567
Living room, uh, kitchen table.

265
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,436
Got a few fish.

266
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,271
Um- And he's got his own room.

267
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,937
I知 doing a bit of work on it.

268
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,242
Uh, we just got some toys today.

269
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,113
- Yeah, we got him a train set.
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,915
Have you given
any thought to schools?

271
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,717
Yes. The public school's
just down the street here...

272
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,418
And it's got a very good
student-teacher ratio.

273
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,483
I actually went there.
It's a good school.

274
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,860
- So you're a local girl.
- Yeah.

275
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,728
All right. What about his diet?

276
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,528
Yeah. Mom?

277
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,069
I致e actually planned out
all of his meals already.

278
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,436
Um, lots of protein and veggies.

279
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,975
Um, no fried. No fried food.

280
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,375
We're cutting that out.
No more fast food.

281
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,073
- Right.
- I've even made a schedule.

282
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,376
Um- Oh.

283
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,849
These are all child safety locks,
by the way.

284
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,045
Yep. Installed them myself.

285
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,751
Well, there's a lot more
to raising a child than toys and locks.

286
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,750
We know.

287
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,563
Look, I can see that
you've worked really hard...

288
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,571
But that doesn't change the fact
that you are ripping this boy away...

289
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,471
From the only life he's ever known.

290
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,807
He's coming from another world.

291
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:11,041
Do you have any idea
what that's going to do to him?

292
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,912
Have you thought about it?

293
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,597
I don't understand why this is our problem.
They made the mistake.

294
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,004
They should have notarized the signature.

295
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,100
You're right. You wanna sue Ohio D.C.S.?
We'll probably win.

296
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:44,410
I don't wanna sue, Tom.
This isn't about money.

297
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,711
But we got a problem.
It's Ohio case law.

298
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,479
It's firm.

299
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,045
There were eight forged adoptions,
all invalidated.

300
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:56,457
And in every case, the child was returned
to the biological parents.

301
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,223
- This judge has no choice.
- You gotta help me, Tom.

302
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,200
Please. There's gotta be somethin'.

303
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,099
Look, Jack. Listen to me.

304
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,868
We won a lot of battles together,
you and me...

305
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,538
But we're not gonna win this one.

306
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,645
So let me tell you
what I would do if it were me.

307
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,948
I would stop wasting my time
talking to lawyers.

308
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,083
Do you follow me?

309
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,303
The interior's good. Yeah.

310
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,182
All right. We got her.

311
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,451
What do you think?

312
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,324
Wow.

313
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,330
I've been thinking a lot about him.

314
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,627
I just, uh-

315
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,736
I'm scared. I want this
to work out so bad, and-

316
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,337
- Honey.
- Huh?

317
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,142
You're gonna be a great father.

318
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,885
- Jack, how are you?
- Thanks for coming. Please, sit down.

319
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:10,653
You're talking about reversing the ruling
of an Ohio judge. I have no legal authority.

320
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,855
Curtis, you're a congressman.

321
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,832
Call in some favors for me.
Twist some arms. I know how it works.

322
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:21,065
It's the state judiciary,
and I can't interfere with that.

323
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,904
What if it was your son?

324
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,413
What if it was Max?
Think about that.

325
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,072
Come on, Jack. That's not fair.

326
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,448
There's a woman coming down here
in three days to take Joey.

327
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,319
- Do you understand that?
- Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

328
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,094
Look, I realize
it's an election year, okay?

329
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,858
- And these aren't popular cases to be associated with.
- What are you talking about?

330
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,333
This has nothing to do with my political career.
Are you kidding me?

331
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,236
I知 asking you to put yourself
on the line for once...

332
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,801
To save my son.

333
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,176
Look.

334
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,239
I know you're under a lot of pressure.
I know that.

335
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:07,943
But I'm sorry. I can't.

336
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,156
I壇 like to help you, Jack, but, um...

337
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,123
It's a state matter.

338
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,126
My hands are tied.

339
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,200
I知 sorry.

340
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,331
Send him to your parents.

341
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,466
That's the first place
they'll look, honey.

342
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,033
Well, if he's not here
when they get here, what-

343
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,807
Then they'll send us to jail.

344
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,712
What good are we then?

345
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,719
We have to send him on the first visit.

346
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,248
Just until I can figure something out.

347
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,495
Let me see these feet.

348
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,627
- Ow!
- Oh!

349
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,001
Hey, you count one, two, three,
all right?

350
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,205
- One-
- Two.

351
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,674
Three.

352
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,835
Oh!

353
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,073
Ouch, Mama.

354
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,308
That was a good one.

355
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,578
It was all-

356
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,382
Crack, crack, crack.

357
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,889
Hey, Joey. Hey, Joe.

358
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,891
I want to telI you something.

359
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,093
You're gonna go on a little trip...

360
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,694
To a place called Ohio.

361
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,066
All right?

362
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,105
Where's Ohio?

363
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,975
It's pretty far,
so you're gonna have to take a plane.

364
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,034
But remember, you love planes, right?

365
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,108
Why do I have to go?

366
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,411
Well...

367
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:53,151
There's this woman,
and she's really nice.

368
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,819
You don't remember her, but she knew you
when you were a little baby.

369
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:01,331
And she asked
if you could come for a visit...

370
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,962
And Daddy and I said yes.

371
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,730
Hey, Joey.

372
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,037
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?

373
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,046
You got nothing to be afraid of.

374
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,241
Look at me, buddy. Hey.

375
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,012
You got nothing to be afraid of.

376
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,611
I want you to come with me.

377
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,290
I can't.

378
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,695
Aah!

379
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,136
I wanna stay here with you.

380
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,208
You listen to me.

381
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,686
Your mother and I
will always be with you...

382
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,745
No matter where you go.

383
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,622
You understand that?

384
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,627
Hmm?

385
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,219
Okay.

386
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,336
I love you.

387
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,233
Ms. Bower.

388
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:34,015
Good morning.

389
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,424
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, I'm very sorry.

390
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,623
I know this must be difficult.

391
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,030
"Difficult"?

392
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,591
Do they teach you to say that,
Ms. Bower?

393
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:58,936
There are a couple of things
I need to go over with you.

394
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:03,468
This has the itinerary
and all of my information in it.

395
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,948
Now, on the first visit...

396
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:11,420
We're gonna tell Joey
that the Porters are just friends.

397
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,288
The next time, we'll refer to them
as "the other Mommy and Daddy. "

398
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:19,386
And on the final visit,
he'll be told the truth.

399
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:22,091
Do you have children, Mrs. Bower?

400
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,765
Yes. Yes, I do.

401
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,929
And I am very sorry.

402
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,837
All right, all right.
What if something happens?

403
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,069
- I'm sorry?
- Ms. Bower.

404
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,509
I know why Rip Porter went to prison.

405
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,515
Mr. Porter's had years of rehabilitation-

406
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,244
and anger management.

407
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,808
Come on.

408
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,821
And the court
has deemed him a fit parent.

409
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,325
Now, I've personally been to their home.

410
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:53,295
- It's a suitable environment.
- A suitable environment?

411
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,425
Joey's not going anywhere.
You can leave now, Ms. Bower.

412
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,297
Good-bye.

413
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,139
Mr. Campbell,
I understand your frustration...

414
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,771
But it's either me...

415
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,248
Or two uniformed police officers.

416
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,080
I致e done it both ways.

417
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,952
Believe me, this way is best for Joey.

418
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,748
Ms. Bower...

419
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,588
If anything happens to my son
while I'm clearing this mess up...

420
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,190
I知 gonna hold you personally responsible.

421
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,896
Jack. Jack.

422
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,406
Come here, baby.

423
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,512
Good morning.
You must be Joey. I'm Allyson.

424
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,640
Hey, sweetie?

425
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:49,049
- Listen to Mom, okay?
- No.

426
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,678
- This is the woman that's
gonna take you to Ohio. - No!

427
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,087
- It's okay, sweetie.
- No!

428
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,888
Baby, it's gonna be okay.
Mommy and Daddy love you so much.

429
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,486
- I don't wanna go! - It's gonna be okay.
We'll be right here when you get back.

430
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:04,466
- Will you give me a moment with my family?
- Of course.

431
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,730
Come here, sweetie.

432
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,204
We have to put your jacket on.

433
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,449
Listen.

434
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,958
I want you to be a big boy, okay?

435
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,454
Okay, you be brave.
I know you can.

436
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,830
I wanna stay with you.

437
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:55,819
Will you come with me to the airplane?

438
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:59,321
We can't go with you to the airplane.

439
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,358
- I'm gonna take you to the car, okay?
- No.

440
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,758
- I'm sorry.
- Please, I don't want to go.

441
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,319
Please don't take me.
I don't wanna go!

442
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,956
No, I don't wanna go!

443
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,535
Rip, they're here.

444
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,101
They're here.

445
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,924
- He's got your eyes.
- Yeah?

446
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,426
- Ain't that somethin'?
- Hello.

447
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,521
Let me get the gate for ya.

448
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,030
Ready?

449
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,379
Mr. and Mrs. Porter, this is Joey.

450
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,848
Hi there.

451
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:04,376
What a big, handsome boy you are.

452
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,116
Welcome to our home.

453
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,885
Can I give you a hug?

454
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,307
This is my wife, Wendy...

455
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,866
And, uh...

456
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,440
My name's Richard.

457
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:35,076
Some people call me Rip.
You can call me whatever you want.

458
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,385
- Nice to meet you.
- Joey?

459
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,357
Rip and Wendy are your new friends.

460
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,657
Now, you need to listen to them
and obey them...

461
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,822
Just as you would your parents.

462
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:49,388
You understand?

463
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,494
Is that your suitcase?
Can I get it for you?

464
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,405
Oh, wow!
You got an elephant in there?

465
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:02,309
You wanna see your room?
I fixed it up myself for you.

466
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:08,479
Oh, hey, we got a dog
in the back named Camper.

467
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,645
- I got a dog named Gus.
- In the backyard there.

468
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,450
Yeah? Well, come on in.

469
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,751
I need you to sign right there.

470
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:20,520
Thank you for everything.

471
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,122
Just remember that he's six
and in a new world.

472
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:25,190
I値l check in tomorrow.

473
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,945
I want their address, Tom.
I want to know where he works.

474
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,504
Give me his rap sheet,
anything else you can get your hands on.

475
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,243
I need this done, and I need it now.

476
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,911
- You understand?
- You need to be careful Court orders-

477
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,945
I've been careful, Tom, and Joey's gone.

478
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,652
- Now, please.
- Okay I'll take care of it

479
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,923
I'm gonna go to Ohio
and see what this guy wants.

480
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,240
- Whoa! This is so cool!
- Yeah?

481
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,973
Wait. Check this out.

482
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,141
For bringing up lunch.

483
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,683
Oh, yeah.

484
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,480
Get up on top.

485
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,849
- Ready?
- Yep.

486
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,118
All right.
Okay, you're gonna put it in up here.

487
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,852
Watch my fingers.

488
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,952
Give her a good smack.
There you go.

489
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,764
- Oh!
- Yeah!

490
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,828
- One, two, three.
- Camper. Go get it!

491
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,805
- Cookies!
- Hey!

492
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,364
Actually, sorry.

493
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,035
No girls allowed.

494
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,103
Aw. I guess I'm gonna
have to take them back then.

495
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,171
You have some cookies, so you can come up.

496
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,047
- I guess you can come up if
you have cookies. - Okay.

497
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,813
So, little Joe, what do you like to do?

498
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,826
I mostly like to sail.

499
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,884
I know how to steer a boat myself.

500
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,329
Do your mom and dad have a boat?

501
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:06,665
Yeah, a big sailboat.
But it also has a motor.

502
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,671
- Mmm.
- You know what we could do?

503
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,866
We could go up to Dillon Lake tomorrow.

504
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,773
They got these little boats
that you can rent. You can steer it.

505
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,312
- How 'bout that?
- Yeah, that could be fun.

506
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,746
I知 done with my cookies now.

507
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,718
So, ready to take a shower, little man?

508
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,782
I don't like showers.

509
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:31,191
Listen, you gotta get cleaned up
before bed, right?

510
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,490
Can't go to bed dirty.

511
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,497
I don't wanna shower.

512
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,124
I just wanna go home.

513
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,066
Can I please go home?

514
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,500
Babe, you know what?

515
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:48,510
What you could do
is go to the bathroom with Wendy...

516
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,512
And just wash up your face and hands...

517
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:54,106
And, you know, maybe that'll
make you feel better.

518
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,118
- Yeah.
- Okay? All right?

519
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,620
That's a great idea.

520
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,850
But, um, next time...

521
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,950
You gotta take a shower, okay?

522
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,360
Okay.

523
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,557
- Hey, let's test the rope swing.
- Yeah!

524
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,895
- All right.
- Oh, boy.

525
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,696
- Ready?
- Have fun.

526
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,430
All right.

527
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:18,065
Yee-haw!

528
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,803
- Whoo!
- That's pretty cool.

529
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,111
Help!

530
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,081
Hoo-hoo! Whoo!

531
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,243
- All right. Your turn.
- Okay.

532
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,309
What a cute nose you have.

533
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,546
Is it kind of upturned?

534
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,525
Kind of like mine.

535
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,396
Hmm.

536
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,179
It's grape juice.

537
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,038
Non-fermented.

538
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,242
A toast...

539
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,646
To my perfect wife...

540
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,750
And my perfect son.

541
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,041
You know...

542
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:04,046
I致e been thinkin' a lot
about the day that he was born...

543
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:08,278
And how I felt when they
took him away from me...

544
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,954
Out of my arms...

545
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,851
And how I was never gonna...

546
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,418
See his little head again...

547
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,293
Or smell his skin.

548
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,458
Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

549
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,024
It's okay.

550
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,938
Nobody-

551
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,966
Nobody's gonna take him
away from us again, okay?

552
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,244
I know.

553
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:39,805
It's okay.

554
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,681
It's just, um...

555
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,654
His mother must be feeling
the same way I did, maybe worse.

556
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,753
Yeah.

557
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:56,488
But, babe, somebody's gonna lose.

558
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,425
It's not gonna be us this time.

559
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,665
You are his mother...

560
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,265
And we are his parents...

561
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,803
And it's right for him to be with us.

562
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,879
Okay?

563
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,886
- Okay.
- Just remember.

564
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,116
Appreciate dinner thank you.

565
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,914
Yeah, of course.

566
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,060
So, did Beth mention that we're going away
in a few weeks to Haiti?

567
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,125
- Mm-mmm.
- Yeah.

568
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,933
What's in Haiti?

569
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,497
- We're gonna take the kids on their
first mission trip. - Oh, yeah?

570
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,804
Yeah, we got our new church
to sponsor an orphanage...

571
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,811
That we've been working with
in Port-au-Prince...

572
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,814
And this year we're gonna help 'em
renovate the compound.

573
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,009
We were thinking that
if you guys wanna come...

574
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,450
It might be a good time to get away.

575
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,823
Or Bill can take the kids,
and I can stay here with you.

576
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,859
- You know, it's really whatever you want.
- Stop!

577
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,587
- What, guys?
- Mom, he's writing on my homework.

578
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,185
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

579
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,164
- Not tonight.
- Yeah, you know what? I think it's time for bed.

580
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,302
Right now, please.

581
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:11,099
- Good night, Uncle Jack.
- Good night.

582
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,672
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.

583
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:19,477
It's really good for them to see
what other parts of the world can be like.

584
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,210
Maybe you should take them to Ohio.

585
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,553
When does he come back?

586
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:32,652
He comes back tomorrow afternoon.

587
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,095
And then he goes again in two weeks...

588
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:37,724
And the next time
he doesn't come back at all.

589
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,797
Hey!

590
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,705
- Hi, buddy!
- What's goin' on, J.?

591
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,772
- Oh! Mmm! I missed you.
- Hi, Dad.

592
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:30,614
- Mmm!
- Look what Wendy gave me.

593
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:32,018
Wow.

594
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,053
He says it went all right.

595
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,968
And we went to a lake,
and I steered a paddleboat all by myself.

596
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,105
And I didn't want to take a shower...

597
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,548
But Wendy said if I did next time...

598
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:05,452
She'd get me my own DVD for my room.

599
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,512
- Was Wendy nice to you?
- Yeah.

600
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,787
Wendy was really nice.
She cooks good too.

601
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:15,162
- How was Rip?
- Good. He's really funny.

602
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,460
We're building a tree house...

603
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:21,629
And we cut part
of Wendy's pillowcase out...

604
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,730
And then we spray-painted
a skull and crossbone.

605
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:29,369
And we have a bucket
that, like, she can put something in...

606
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,243
And then we pull it up with the rope.

607
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:34,408
It's so cool.

608
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,145
They're bribing him.

609
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,881
I never thought
he'd actually want to go back.

610
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:41,617
- What if he wants to be with them?
- He's six years old.

611
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,592
What if he has some deep connection
to these people?

612
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,959
- Like, he feels that-
- He doesn't even know them.

613
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,964
He came from them, Jack.

614
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,091
Mom, I'm done with my bath.

615
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:59,102
All right. I'm gonna go to Ohio
first thing in the morning.

616
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,987
- Yo, Rip.
- Yo!

617
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,546
- See you Sunday.
- See you Sunday.

618
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,554
Peace out, man.

619
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,118
- Take it easy.
- See you later.

620
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,857
See you later.

621
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,772
Mr. Porter.

622
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,405
Yeah.

623
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,245
I知 Jack Campbell, Joey's father.

624
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,331
It's good to meet you, Jack.

625
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,170
How much do you want, Rip?

626
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,567
Come again?

627
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:10,943
This is an amendment
to the original adoption.

628
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:15,314
You sign this,
I give you half a million dollars in cash.

629
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,443
Here.

630
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:29,187
- That's a whole lot of money, Jack.
- Yes, sir.

631
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,126
You sign it, I pay you,
and we walk away.

632
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,864
What do you say?

633
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,642
You come up
with $500,000 in cash, Jack...

634
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,950
I知 betting you could
come up with a million.

635
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,753
Okay. Make it a million.

636
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,762
That was fast.
That was fast, Jack.

637
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,820
- Let's make it a million.
- Yeah?

638
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,231
Boy, you said that so fast...

639
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,462
I figure you can come up with two.

640
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:12,301
Fine. Just sign it.

641
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:17,012
Two million dollars.

642
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:19,674
Then I'd be just like you, Jack.

643
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,910
Big house...

644
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,680
Big boat and big shot, huh?

645
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:27,086
Yeah, that's right.
You can be anything you want, Rip.

646
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,851
Anything at all.

647
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,164
What do you want, Rip?
What do you want?

648
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,396
I want my son, okay?

649
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:44,531
And you can't have him,
not for no money.

650
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,940
Not two million, not 10 million,
'cause my son ain't for sale.

651
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,376
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Rip, listen to me one second.

652
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,813
Just listen to me. Please. Please.

653
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,351
With that kind of money,
you could start over.

654
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:59,149
You could have as many kids as you want.
You understand?

655
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,986
What am I, a dog?
You don't know me.

656
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,287
You don't know me.
What, you can't have any kids?

657
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:07,386
You got no bullets
in your gun, big shot, huh?

658
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,198
You don't know me!
You don't know me!

659
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,670
- You-
- I'll send you back to prison, you hear me?

660
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,178
You're going to prison!
You're the one violating the court order!

661
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:27,011
Either way, you can't have my son.

662
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,830
What happened?

663
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,634
He doesn't want the money.

664
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,102
He wants Joey.

665
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,170
Jack, he can't do this.
He assaulted you.

666
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:07,238
We call the police.
We file a report.

667
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,477
Molly.

668
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,520
It won't work.

669
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,077
Why not?

670
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,248
Because if I report him...

671
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,692
I go to jaiI too.

672
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,825
Okay.

673
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:32,407
What do we do?

674
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,211
I don't know.

675
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:45,550
I don't know.

676
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,184
You don't know?

677
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,060
That's it?

678
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:57,395
You try to buy him off,
it doesn't work, and now you're done?

679
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:01,768
What else do you want me to do?

680
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,465
You tell me.
What else should I do, Molly?

681
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:07,134
I don't know- something, anything.

682
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,837
You're his father.
You don't just give up.

683
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,403
I知 not giving up!
I've done everything!

684
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,540
I don't care what it takes.

685
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,053
I知 not giving up my son.

686
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,487
You know what?
You're something, you know?

687
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,549
- I'm not giving up my son!
- Look at my face!

688
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,925
Look at me!

689
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,521
What a horrible father I am.

690
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,960
I致e done everything, Molly.

691
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,229
Why don't you do something?

692
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,438
Do something.

693
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,382
I知 going to bed.

694
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:03,120
Please! Don't take my baby.

695
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,910
- Oh, baby.
- I know.

696
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,781
- I'm sorry.
- You don't need this, darling.

697
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,988
Baby, don't. I do. I just need it.

698
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,616
- I know. This is not gonna fix things.
- No, no, no, no!

699
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,558
Don't, don't, don't! No, no, no!

700
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,460
Hey! Don't!

701
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:43,700
Honey, you don't need that.
You don't need that anymore.

702
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:44,967
Please, baby? You don't need to.

703
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,066
Please, no.

704
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,614
- Get- Get out.
- No, no. Baby, no. No, please.

705
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:04,251
I love you so much.

706
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,158
Please tell me you've changed, baby.
Please.

707
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,628
Please.

708
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,859
I- I lost seven years.

709
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,899
You gonna be okay, buddy?

710
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,871
Yeah. We're gonna paint my tree house.

711
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,973
- Joey, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

712
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:56,875
Bye, Dad.

713
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,136
I love you.

714
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,308
I love you too.

715
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,789
- Put your seat belt on, bud.
- Okay.

716
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:21,125
Bye, sweetie.

717
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,665
- Paw.
- Nice.

718
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,768
One, two, three!

719
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,743
- Ha, ha!
- Whoo-hoo!

720
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,439
You stacked his deck.

721
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:35,677
Hey, just one thing, so I can remember.

722
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,514
Let's you had a birthday coming up...

723
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,679
What would you want to eat
on your birthday?

724
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:44,354
A- A chicken cake.

725
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,189
Chicken cake?
Chicken-flavored cake?

726
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,821
- Chicken with cake.
- Chicken with cake?

727
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:52,197
- A chicken cake. - You want a cake
made in the shape of a chicken?

728
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,395
- No.
- You want chicken inside the cake?

729
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,064
- Chicken inside the cake.
- All right, I'm gonna file that away.

730
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,697
All right, let's go.

731
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,142
One, two, three.

732
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,040
- Joker! I win.
- I win!

733
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,742
You won? I thought joker
was better than everything.

734
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,284
No. That was before.

735
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,842
- Before what?
- When I had joker.

736
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,291
Reminds me of someone.

737
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,589
All right, card shark,
ready to hop in the shower?

738
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,688
I don't want to take a shower.

739
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,994
Oh, we gotta get you clean somehow.

740
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,160
Look at you. P. U.

741
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,828
P. U. to you.

742
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:32,135
Now, listen, we gotta get you in there
and get you cleaned up.

743
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:35,643
Remember we talked?
We got different rules here.

744
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:39,010
I need you to go
and jump in the shower. Okay?

745
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:43,310
You can do it.

746
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:46,845
You know what?
Why don't I take care of it?

747
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,912
Honey, don't spoil him.

748
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,152
- I'm not spoiling him. It's just that-
- It's fine.

749
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:53,456
- It's just that I think that-
- He's a big boy.

750
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,430
You're a big boy. Come on.
Get your gear. Let's go.

751
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,533
Come on, bud.

752
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:05,536
Hop in the shower.

753
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,439
I don't wanna take a shower.

754
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:12,173
Doesn't work like that
here, buddy. Come on.

755
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:14,011
I need you to obey me...

756
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,108
And I need you to get in the bathroom.

757
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:19,120
You know, I think that you're
really upsetting him now.

758
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:22,282
No, you know what? I'm-I'm-
I'm actually the one who's getting upset.

759
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:23,950
- So would you just-
- Okay.

760
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:26,051
Come here.
Come here, sweetie.

761
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,959
Here, we'll go together, okay?

762
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,759
It'll be fun, all right? Come on.

763
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,468
Let's go, Joey.

764
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:36,902
Please, sweetheart.
It's only water.

765
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,337
It's nothin'.

766
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,500
Come on. What are you doing?

767
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,908
Come on, buddy, in the shower.

768
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,843
- Come on.
- I don't wanna take a shower.

769
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,314
- He's really scared of it.
He's really scared. - It'll be fun.

770
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:49,442
- I don't think we should push him.
- He's a big boy, baby.

771
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:51,281
He's not made of sugar.
He's not gonna melt.

772
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,947
- I don't wanna take a shower.
- Just take your shirt off, and let's get going.

773
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,718
- No.
- You wanna do it together?

774
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:59,488
We'll do it with our clothes on.
Come on. It'll be fun. Whoo!

775
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,052
Come on. You ready?
Whoo-hoo!

776
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,827
Rip, what are you doing?
Rip, stop it!

777
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,061
Stop that!

778
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,627
- Rip, this is not fun! You're scaring him!
- Right?

779
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,604
- It's okay. We're having fun.
- It's not okay!

780
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:13,539
It's not fun. You're scaring him.

781
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,271
- He's okay, baby. He's okay. He's fine.
- He's not!

782
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,439
- Rip, you're hurting him!
Rip, you're hurting him! - Ow!

783
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:20,846
- Stop! You're hurting him!
- Okay.

784
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,043
- This is hurting him. Stop it.
- You okay?

785
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:32,486
- You're okay.
- No!

786
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,189
You hurt him.

787
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,958
Listen, listen.

788
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,025
I need to telI you something, okay?

789
00:57:44,328 --> 00:57:47,400
Wendy- Wendy is your real mommy.

790
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,705
- Rip, not now.
- Shh, baby.

791
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,474
This is not the right time.

792
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:54,345
- And I'm your real daddy, okay?
- No, you're not.

793
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,281
And you came here to live with us.

794
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,547
- No, you're not!
- Yes, I am.

795
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,918
- I'm your real daddy, and this
is your real mommy. - Rip.

796
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:04,050
- I wanna see my daddy!
- I am your daddy.

797
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:07,061
- I wanna go home!
- You are home. You are home.

798
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,119
I wanna go home!

799
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,723
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Rip.

800
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,267
It's okay.

801
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,961
- That's enough. That's enough.
- It's okay.

802
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:17,403
Come here, sweetie.

803
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:20,169
That's enough for one night.
That's enough.

804
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:04,150
The first night we moved,
I sat right here.

805
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,948
Right here with Joey.

806
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:10,523
I remember I asked him- I said, "Son...

807
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,582
How deep do you think the ocean is?"

808
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:17,290
He said, "Daddy, I bet you
it's 50feet deep. "

809
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:35,143
We used to be on the same team.

810
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:40,119
I don't feeI like we are anymore.

811
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,662
You know, honey, you were right.

812
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:55,302
I was disappointed when we-
when we adopted Joey.

813
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:01,973
I wanted my own son.
I wanted my own blood.

814
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:10,712
But from the moment that he came home...

815
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,981
I loved him like he was mine.

816
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:22,789
But he's not mine.

817
01:00:22,853 --> 01:00:26,323
They can just take him-

818
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,137
They could just take him away.

819
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,550
Hey, little man.

820
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,633
Hey, Joey.

821
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,642
Do you know about dandelions-

822
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,769
how you can make wishes on 'em?

823
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:52,779
You just close your eyes, make a wish...

824
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,948
And then... you blow.

825
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,452
Why blow on it?

826
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:04,693
Because there's a wish inside here.

827
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,196
And when you blow on it...

828
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:10,932
That wish gets set free.

829
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,303
And then it can come true.

830
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,980
You wanna try it?

831
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,420
Wishes are important, Joey.

832
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:33,052
You always have to believe that things
can get better than they are now.

833
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,004
Hey.

834
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,411
- What's wrong?
- Hey. What happened?

835
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,347
Well, I think things were
a little more difficult this time.

836
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,385
- Difficult how, Ms. Bower?
- I don't know.

837
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,818
He wouldn't tell me.
Maybe he'll tell you.

838
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,881
Oh. Mrs. Porter offered to give you
an extra week to say your good-byes.

839
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:40,189
- And the judge agreed.
- Okay. Thank you.

840
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,752
Bye, Joey.

841
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,197
- Hey.
- What happened?

842
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,929
Hey, hey. What's the matter?

843
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,702
What happened? Joey?

844
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,106
- Hey, hey. Hey.
- Sweetie?

845
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,601
Joey?

846
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:02,973
Joey?

847
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,611
Joey, what happened?

848
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,677
Joey, come on.
Sit up and talk to me.

849
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,921
- Come here, sweetie.
- What's going on?

850
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,756
- Talk to me. What happened?
- He hurt me.

851
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:16,525
He made me take a shower
in my clothes.

852
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,896
- He what?
- Where, sweetie? Where did he hurt you?

853
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,032
Rip did this to you?

854
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:26,335
He said you're not
my real mommy and daddy.

855
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:29,275
- Is that true?
- No.

856
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,334
No, sweetheart, that's not true.

857
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,674
That's not true.

858
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:37,844
An extra week?
Why would you agree to this?

859
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:40,820
- I didn't agree to it.
- What?

860
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,956
- It was my idea.
- It was your- What?

861
01:04:48,785 --> 01:04:50,093
Why?

862
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:52,861
'Cause you're not ready.
You need more time.

863
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,300
Oh, so you just-
That's your decision, is it?

864
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:59,806
You just go behind my back
and keep me from my son?

865
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,865
You hurt him, Rip.

866
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:03,672
I didn't mean to hurt him. I was trying-

867
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,475
But you did hurt him,
and you terrified him.

868
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,346
I知 just trying to protect him-
and you.

869
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,476
Right. How can you say that?

870
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:15,614
How can you say that when you lie
and you hide these things from me?

871
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,214
I知 not lying. I told you.

872
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,988
I知 telling you.
I'm not hiding anything.

873
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,323
Where you goin'?

874
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,365
I知 gonna go wash my face,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

875
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,562
No! I need to talk to you about this.
You should've told me.

876
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,605
I think you'd better sleep on the couch.

877
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,162
No.

878
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,639
No! Listen.

879
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:36,006
- Call her back and tell her
you made a mistake. - No.

880
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,477
- Baby, listen to me. Just call her.
- No.

881
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:41,311
No! I said no! It wasn't a mistake!

882
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:42,975
Call her!

883
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:06,269
Get the camera.
I want a shot of that bruise right now.

884
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:09,004
- Who are you calling?
- Allyson Bower.

885
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:12,343
Call Dr. Riley and tell him that I'll be
in there in 15 minutes with Joey.

886
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:15,781
All of this is gonna accomplish what? What-
you're gonna file a lawsuit, send Porter to jail?

887
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,911
- I'm gonna send him to prison. - You said it yourself.
That's not gonna do us any good.

888
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,717
We could put Porter away for the rest
of his life. Joey still won't be ours.

889
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:23,348
- This is Jack Campbell for Allyson Bower.
- Jack.

890
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:25,415
What then? What?

891
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,721
We have to leave.

892
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,156
We have to pack our things and go.

893
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:45,640
Look.

894
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,676
We've both been thinking it.
We just haven't wanted to say it.

895
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:56,046
We can't win, Jack.

896
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:04,827
You want to run away?

897
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,836
Listen to me.

898
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:15,934
No one is coming to save us.

899
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,309
Go where?

900
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,579
Out of the country.
Anywhere.

901
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:31,789
You realize what you're saying,
don't you?

902
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:34,718
I do.

903
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,366
All of this would be gone.

904
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:43,331
We'd never be able to come back.

905
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,395
All our friends...

906
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:48,470
Your sister-

907
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:50,910
We'd never be able to contact them again.

908
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:58,108
We'd have Joey.

909
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:07,818
Yeah.

910
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:16,661
- Hey. Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.

911
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,535
- How are you?
- Good. You want some tea?

912
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,869
Sure.

913
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,671
So what's going on?

914
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:24,803
How come you couldn't
tell me on the phone?

915
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:27,109
Curt Golding talked
to the congressman from Ohio...

916
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:31,016
And he's asked D.C.S. for an investigation
by the state commission.

917
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:32,519
What does that mean?

918
01:08:32,576 --> 01:08:34,180
It means the transfer's suspended...

919
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:38,920
And the commission can reverse
the judge's decision- permanently.

920
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:42,293
That's great! Oh, sweetheart!

921
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:44,093
See? I knew something would give.

922
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,724
I knew something would give.

923
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:49,931
Um, listen, Jack and I were talking...

924
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:53,600
And we think we want
to go to Haiti with you.

925
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,165
Really?

926
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:57,041
Yeah. I mean, with everything
that's gone on...

927
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,173
I think it would be great for alI of us to
get away, be together as a family.

928
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:03,741
So, what do you think?

929
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,878
And it's okay to take him
out of the country?

930
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:08,286
- You're allowed?
- Of course it is.

931
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:11,224
The order's suspended.
We can do what we want.

932
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:15,559
Besides, I think it'd be fun,
you know, for the kids, for us.

933
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:19,567
Do you think you can
arrange it with the church?

934
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:22,797
It's a little last-minute,
but-but absolutely.

935
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,703
- We'll work it out.
- Okay.

936
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,679
- Good to see you.
- Hi. Good.

937
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:36,240
We'll see you inside.

938
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:39,887
Hey. Hi there, Molly.

939
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:41,820
It's Joey. You see him?

940
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:43,653
Joey!

941
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:46,091
Wow. Hey, Jack.

942
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:47,787
Hey.

943
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:49,888
- It's good to see you, sir.
- Nice to be back.

944
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:54,268
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

945
01:09:56,393 --> 01:10:00,432
# The Lord bless you #

946
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:04,877
# And keep you #

947
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:11,784
# The Lord lift his countenance
upon you #

948
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:18,954
# And give you peace #

949
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:23,361
# The Lord make his face #

950
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,630
# To shine upon you #

951
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:34,633
# the Lord be gracious #

952
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:41,206
# Gracious unto you #

953
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:49,347
# Amen #

954
01:10:49,412 --> 01:11:05,173
# Amen#

955
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:13,542
# Amen #

956
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:23,012
# Amen #

957
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:32,726
Who is it?

958
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,168
It's Allyson Bower, Mrs. Porter.

959
01:11:36,226 --> 01:11:39,139
I know it's late,
but I need to speak with you.

960
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:43,378
I知 sorry.
I can't come to the door right now.

961
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:48,108
Mrs. Porter,
you haven't returned my calls.

962
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,777
I need to speak with you
just for a moment.

963
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,786
Please, open the door.

964
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:00,354
Mrs. Porter?

965
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:22,542
Something's going on
with Jack and Molly.

966
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:24,551
What do you mean?

967
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:29,115
She says the congressman
is helping her.

968
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,557
But I know her.

969
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:36,392
And the way she's acting,
there's just something that's not right.

970
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:39,332
- How should she be acting?
- Think about it.

971
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:41,232
Suddenly she's going to church with us...

972
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:44,101
And now they want
to leave the country and go to Haiti.

973
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,606
Don't you think it's strange?

974
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:49,803
No, I don't think it's strange.
We invited them, remember?

975
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:53,006
You know what I mean.

976
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:00,477
Honey, you need to be careful.

977
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:07,124
I appreciate you taking my call.

978
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:10,995
I just wanted to thank you personally.

979
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,795
Excuse me?

980
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:15,894
I just wanted to thank you
for what you're doing-

981
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17,700
for Joey, for their son.

982
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:21,334
Ms. Norton, I told Jack weeks ago
there was nothing I could do...

983
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,343
And there is still nothing I can do.

984
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,174
I'm very sorry for his situation...

985
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:27,442
But I really don't appreciate
this phone call.

986
01:13:27,504 --> 01:13:31,350
- I'm- I'm sorry, Congressman.
I must have misunderstood. -It's alright

987
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,320
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-
- That's fine.

988
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:36,323
- Have a good day
- Thank you.

989
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,327
Are you my real dad?

990
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,110
Well.

991
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,679
Let me ask you.

992
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:04,980
What do you think?

993
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,783
I think you are.

994
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,016
Why?

995
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,955
You take care of me...

996
01:14:11,014 --> 01:14:13,187
And you taught me
how to play baseball.

997
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:15,251
And I changed your diapers too.
That was gross.

998
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:23,334
What else?
What else do I do, son?

999
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:25,339
You love me.

1000
01:14:25,395 --> 01:14:27,397
Yeah.

1001
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,774
And that's the most important thing
a father can do.

1002
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:33,212
So why did Rip say he was my dad?

1003
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,454
Listen to me for a second, Joe, okay?
This might be a little confusing.

1004
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,753
But I'm gonna try to explain
something to you, all right?

1005
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:48,159
Wendy is the woman
that gave birth to you, okay?

1006
01:14:48,218 --> 01:14:50,562
And then your mother and I met you...

1007
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,762
And we loved you so much
that we became your real parents-forever.

1008
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,303
Just like Robbie Elwood?

1009
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:59,306
That's right. That's right.
We adopted you, son.

1010
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:01,740
So I'm gonna stay here
with you and Mom?

1011
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:04,074
Is that what you want?

1012
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,635
It is?

1013
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:09,582
Okay.

1014
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:15,555
Then we'll be together,
no matter what. All right?

1015
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:19,092
No matter what.

1016
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,562
- That's it.
- Thanks, babe.

1017
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,980
Ladies and gentlemen...

1018
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,647
Flight 56 is now ready for boarding.

1019
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,054
We'd like to be in first-class
and gold card members...

1020
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:52,753
to board Flight 56, thank you.

1021
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:06,771
Okay.

1022
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:08,502
- Put your seat belt on? That's good.
- Yeah.

1023
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:17,050
Turn around and buckle up.

1024
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:25,893
Ladies and gentlemen,
the boarding door has been closed

1025
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:29,988
Once again, this is Flight 257
with nonstop service to Port-au-Prince.

1026
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:32,693
Before the aircraft moves,
all passengers must be seated..

1027
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:36,498
With your seat belts securely fastened
tray stations stowed and baggage secured

1028
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:38,334
Enjoy your fight

1029
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:31,084
Hey, friend, come with me.
Let me show you your quarters.

1030
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,080
You get any of that on the fence?

1031
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,674
Hey, easy now.

1032
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,620
We were working hard manual labor
while you boys were in town shopping.

1033
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:38,523
- Believe me, you were better off here.
- Bill, you mind taking over?

1034
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:41,323
- Oh, yeah, with pleasure. Can I do that?
- Oh, gladly.

1035
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,523
I値l go get cleaned up.

1036
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,423
Hey.

1037
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:50,494
So, I found a taxi driver
to pick us up tomorrow at 2:00 p. m.

1038
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,301
And our flight's at 4:30.

1039
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,337
Okay. Do you think he'll show?

1040
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:58,401
Yeah. I gave him
a hundred dollars today...

1041
01:18:58,468 --> 01:19:01,642
And I said I'd give him $200 tomorrow
when he gets us to the airport.

1042
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:04,583
Trust me. That's a lot of money
for a guy like that. He'll show.

1043
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,276
You're home early.

1044
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:42,479
Yeah.

1045
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,487
They sent me home.

1046
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,654
I can't concentrate, and I-

1047
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:52,054
I can't eat and I can't sleep.

1048
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:55,933
And I don't understand why you-
you haven't called the police.

1049
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,362
No police.

1050
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,279
So you're leaving me then.

1051
01:20:08,738 --> 01:20:10,240
No.

1052
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:13,415
I don't think so.

1053
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,490
Rip.

1054
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:27,392
We've both made
big mistakes in our lives.

1055
01:20:31,594 --> 01:20:33,699
But I know your heart.

1056
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:37,667
I know, inside, you're good...

1057
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,780
Even if you don't.

1058
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,861
I知 sorry.

1059
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,770
I知 so sorry.

1060
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,070
Sorry.

1061
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,916
I know.

1062
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:22,951
Now, if we're going to try...

1063
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:27,394
There's one thing I-I need.

1064
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,538
You remember?

1065
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:40,335
Father Logan.

1066
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,249
We'll do it together, babe.

1067
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,381
Me and you.

1068
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:25,519
Tackle him.

1069
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:28,580
Okay.

1070
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:31,989
Oh, my gosh!

1071
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:36,360
Oh!

1072
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,490
I'm exhausted.

1073
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:40,261
Nice job, man.

1074
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:42,769
Nice, man.
That's what I like to see.

1075
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:46,432
I値l meet you guys at the bus at noon, and then
we'll head into town with everybody else?

1076
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:49,738
Actually, we were thinking about hanging as
a family and letting you guys do your thing.

1077
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:52,006
We'll come back and have dinner
with you later, if you don't mind.

1078
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:53,741
- It's good by me. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1079
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:56,283
- It's good.
- Okay. You sure?

1080
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:58,410
Yeah. Is that okay?

1081
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,545
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you want.

1082
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,782
Okay.

1083
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:04,586
See you at dinner. I love you.

1084
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,591
Okay.

1085
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:11,530
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1086
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:13,260
Okay.

1087
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,097
- See you later?
- Yeah, man. Have fun. Joey.

1088
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,228
You guys have a good day.

1089
01:23:19,195 --> 01:23:20,469
- Bye.
- Bye, Joey.

1090
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:22,907
- He's a ballplayer, huh?
- Yeah, he is.

1091
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:24,706
- See you tonight.
- All right, Jack.

1092
01:23:24,767 --> 01:23:27,407
Are you hot? Your cheeks are all pink.

1093
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:30,110
- Come on, buddy.
- See you guys.

1094
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:31,674
Poor thing.

1095
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,246
Are you okay?

1096
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:12,754
Come here.

1097
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:26,266
Molly lied.

1098
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:29,669
Curt Golding isn't helping them.

1099
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:35,145
They used us, Bill.

1100
01:24:35,204 --> 01:24:37,445
They used the church, this trip.

1101
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:43,019
They're taking Joey,
and they're running away.

1102
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,149
I know.

1103
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:49,889
What? What do you mean you know?

1104
01:24:49,952 --> 01:24:52,694
It's what I would have done.

1105
01:24:55,891 --> 01:25:00,067
No, Bill. No, it's wrong,
and you know it's wrong.

1106
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:03,303
- If God wanted them to have Joey-
- Beth, stop it! Stop it!

1107
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:07,472
You don't get to decide
what God's will is.

1108
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:10,608
Do you want Joey to be beaten,
maybe killed by this man?

1109
01:25:10,673 --> 01:25:11,981
No.

1110
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,816
The courts are wrong, Beth.

1111
01:25:13,876 --> 01:25:16,083
What other option
do they have at this point?

1112
01:25:19,148 --> 01:25:21,685
Honey, what else is this trip for
if not to save children?

1113
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,230
Right?

1114
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,527
I know you're gonna miss your sister.

1115
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:30,401
But this isn't your choice.
We have to let them go.

1116
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:35,571
Everything's gonna be okay.

1117
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,774
No, it's not.

1118
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:42,338
Why?

1119
01:25:48,978 --> 01:25:52,118
I called Allyson Bower.

1120
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,626
Oh, Beth.

1121
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:04,466
All right, here we go.
Line up. Line up.

1122
01:26:04,527 --> 01:26:07,098
Defense, you're getting burned.

1123
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,244
- Jack.
- What?

1124
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:21,254
You need to get your family
out of here right now.

1125
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:23,722
- What? What are you talking about?
- Now.

1126
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,986
- Bill, what's going on?
- I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

1127
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,289
- What?
- Dad, is everything okay?

1128
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,796
Let's go. Let's go.

1129
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:32,764
Let's go. Let's go.
Walk, walk, walk.

1130
01:26:32,821 --> 01:26:35,131
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys to the jeep.

1131
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,194
Jack. Jack. Here you go.
Take the jeep.

1132
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,570
Where to? Where to?

1133
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:43,840
I got you covered. Go, go, go.

1134
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:46,402
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

1135
01:26:46,468 --> 01:26:47,913
What did you do?

1136
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:49,972
Sit on your mom's lap.

1137
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,947
Come here, baby. Come here.

1138
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:55,579
Just relax, sweetheart. Just relax.

1139
01:26:58,681 --> 01:27:01,059
Mommy, where are we going?

1140
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:20,505
It's okay, baby. Just breathe.

1141
01:27:27,042 --> 01:27:29,852
At the gate,
we'll just go nice and easy, all right?

1142
01:27:40,522 --> 01:27:42,661
- How are you, sir?
- How you doing, man?

1143
01:27:42,725 --> 01:27:44,932
- Where you going?
- We're just going shopping.

1144
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:46,496
That's okay. That's okay.

1145
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:02,413
- Everything's okay?
- Perfect.

1146
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:03,855
Good.

1147
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:13,361
Thanks a lot.

1148
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:19,169
Okay! Stop! Get out of your car!

1149
01:28:19,228 --> 01:28:21,367
- Easy, man.
- Mommy?

1150
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,103
Right now.

1151
01:28:23,165 --> 01:28:25,372
Jack.

1152
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:43,282
Mr. and Mrs. Campbell.

1153
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,620
Where is our son?

1154
01:29:46,682 --> 01:29:48,821
I知 sorry that you had
to be brought back this way...

1155
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:51,387
But I had to stop you
from making a very big mistake.

1156
01:29:51,453 --> 01:29:53,797
- Is Joey all right?
- He's fine.

1157
01:29:53,856 --> 01:29:55,927
- He's just down the hall.
- Ms. Bower, we've done nothing wrong.

1158
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:59,131
Mr. Campbell, please, have a seat.

1159
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:09,515
Now, you did do something wrong.
We both know that.

1160
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,950
And I've spent a lot of hours
trying to keep you out of jail.

1161
01:30:13,008 --> 01:30:14,612
I壇 like to talk to my lawyer.

1162
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:18,283
Mr. Campbell, I am on your side.

1163
01:30:18,347 --> 01:30:20,190
I am.

1164
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:23,458
Now, it's been a really
long night for all of us.

1165
01:30:26,288 --> 01:30:29,963
I have Mrs. Porter with me.
She's right outside.

1166
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:32,505
She wants to talk to you...

1167
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:34,507
So I'm gonna bring her in.

1168
01:30:49,478 --> 01:30:50,650
Hello.

1169
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:56,658
I知 Wendy Porter.

1170
01:31:00,422 --> 01:31:03,232
I know you tried to run away with Joey.

1171
01:31:04,927 --> 01:31:06,668
Ms. Porter...

1172
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:10,969
He had bruises on his body.

1173
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:15,605
I was just trying to protect my son.

1174
01:31:18,774 --> 01:31:21,778
I have to telI you, when you...

1175
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:25,314
Offered my husband money for Joey...

1176
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:30,026
You nearly crushed the man.

1177
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:33,897
Would that be what you
would teach our son? That-

1178
01:31:33,956 --> 01:31:36,300
That poor people can just be bought off?

1179
01:31:36,358 --> 01:31:37,359
No.

1180
01:31:37,426 --> 01:31:41,772
I thought he wanted money.

1181
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,401
And I- I was wrong.

1182
01:31:46,602 --> 01:31:49,048
And I know that now.

1183
01:31:49,104 --> 01:31:53,143
You have no idea how much
that boy means to him.

1184
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:58,381
I made a terrible mistake seven years ago.

1185
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:01,291
I never should have given up my baby.

1186
01:32:02,718 --> 01:32:06,666
But with everything that's happened...

1187
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:09,965
I need to be sure now that
I'm doing the right thing for him.

1188
01:32:20,669 --> 01:32:22,910
Mrs. Porter.

1189
01:32:22,971 --> 01:32:24,644
Wendy.

1190
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:30,688
Joey is our whole world.

1191
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:32,657
He's our boy.

1192
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:37,254
I love him as if
I gave birth to him myself.

1193
01:32:39,354 --> 01:32:43,200
And I can't imagine
spending a day without him.

1194
01:32:48,230 --> 01:32:50,176
But from the moment
we brought him home...

1195
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:54,442
My biggest fear was that
he would wake up one morning...

1196
01:32:54,503 --> 01:32:57,677
And realize that
I'm not really his mother...

1197
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:00,276
That I'm...

1198
01:33:00,342 --> 01:33:04,688
Just some woman who's raising him.

1199
01:33:08,317 --> 01:33:10,820
But he never did.

1200
01:33:20,696 --> 01:33:22,642
And he never will.

1201
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:25,342
Ms. Bower.

1202
01:33:26,368 --> 01:33:30,748
I have the revised adoption papers here.

1203
01:33:30,806 --> 01:33:33,013
Mr. Porter has already signed...

1204
01:33:33,075 --> 01:33:35,988
And I personally
witnessed his signature.

1205
01:34:12,614 --> 01:34:15,390
Thank you.

1206
01:34:16,518 --> 01:34:18,020
Thank you so much.

1207
01:34:19,388 --> 01:34:21,527
I want you both to know that, uh...

1208
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:25,037
Rip really does love Joey.

1209
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:28,939
He just wasn't ready to be a father,
and he knows that.

1210
01:34:31,933 --> 01:34:33,844
Ms. Porter...

1211
01:34:35,937 --> 01:34:38,247
Will you tell your husband
that I apologize?

1212
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:46,890
Is there anything that we can do for you?

1213
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:48,552
And it doesn't have to be money.

1214
01:34:48,617 --> 01:34:51,188
I mean, I-

1215
01:34:51,253 --> 01:34:53,961
We'll be all right.
We're getting help. Thanks.

1216
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:59,605
There is one thing that-
that you could do for me.

1217
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:07,043
I would like Joey to know
that he- he has two mothers-

1218
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:10,777
one that loved him so much
that she couldn't let him go...

1219
01:35:10,839 --> 01:35:13,513
And one that loved him so much
that she had to.

1220
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:26,262
You have my word.

1221
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:30,463
Thank you.

1222
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:39,777
May I- May I say good-bye to him?

1223
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:44,317
Of course.

1224
01:35:54,516 --> 01:35:57,224
Joey, it was real nice...

1225
01:35:57,285 --> 01:35:59,856
Having you come
and spend time with us at our house.

1226
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:03,164
Getting to know you...

1227
01:36:03,225 --> 01:36:07,002
And see what a bright
and beautiful boy you've become...

1228
01:36:08,663 --> 01:36:10,643
Laughing with you and

1229
01:36:10,699 --> 01:36:15,307
have honestly been some
of the happiest moments of my life.

1230
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:17,179
What happened to your face?

1231
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:20,186
Oh, I got hurt, but I'm gonna be okay.

1232
01:36:21,543 --> 01:36:23,420
Am I gonna come see you again?

1233
01:36:23,478 --> 01:36:26,322
No. No, sweetheart.
That was our last visit.

1234
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:28,383
You're not coming back anymore.

1235
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:29,656
Why not?

1236
01:36:31,987 --> 01:36:34,558
Remember I told you
about the dandelion...

1237
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,864
And how we had to set the wish free?

1238
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,200
Sometimes people are like that too, baby.

1239
01:36:43,832 --> 01:36:46,210
Now...

1240
01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:49,613
I want you to remember me...

1241
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:52,117
And try and remember...

1242
01:36:52,174 --> 01:36:55,383
Only the happy times, okay?

1243
01:36:57,512 --> 01:37:02,518
This here... is very special.

1244
01:37:02,584 --> 01:37:05,565
Rip gave it to me
when I was a girl, and...

1245
01:37:07,289 --> 01:37:09,599
I want you to have it.

1246
01:37:09,658 --> 01:37:12,002
Inside is a picture of me and Rip...

1247
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,439
And our address in case you
should ever need anything...

1248
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:18,068
Anything at all.

1249
01:37:18,133 --> 01:37:21,774
Maybe one day when
you're a big, strong man...

1250
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,577
We'll meet again.

1251
01:37:30,045 --> 01:37:31,786
I love you.

1252
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:42,968
This is the final boarding call-

1253
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,526
Mommy! Daddy!

1254
01:37:44,593 --> 01:37:46,937
- Hey.
- Hey!

1255
01:37:46,995 --> 01:37:49,407
Oh! Oh, we missed you.

1256
01:37:49,464 --> 01:37:51,637
- Me too.
- Yeah, you okay?

1257
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,244
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1258
01:37:54,302 --> 01:37:55,804
Okay, good.

1259
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:00,517
So what have you been doing?

1260
01:38:24,499 --> 01:38:26,137
- Yep.
- Amazing.

1261
01:38:26,201 --> 01:38:27,874
Ha, ha!

1262
01:38:27,936 --> 01:38:30,177
Come here, Son. You ready?

1263
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:34,652
Now, hold on tight, okay? All right.

1264
01:38:36,111 --> 01:38:37,954
- Can you steer it?
- Yeah.

1265
01:38:38,013 --> 01:38:39,583
Feels great.

1266
01:38:40,348 --> 01:38:42,385
You stay right there.

1267
01:38:44,019 --> 01:38:45,965
- Is it fun?
- Yeah!

1268
01:38:46,021 --> 01:38:47,591
Good job.

1269
01:38:47,656 --> 01:38:48,964
