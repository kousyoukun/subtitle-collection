片名：最终幻想之灵魂深处

2
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,500
梦已记录  2065年12月13日

3
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,900
每天晚上同样的梦  同样的怪异星球
Every night, the same dream. The same strange planet.   

4
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,900
但是为什么
But why?

5
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,590
他们想告诉我什么
What are they trying to tell me?

6
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,910
他们到这个星球已有34年
It has been 34 years since they arrived in this planet.

7
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,920
被迫移居到堡垒城市的幸存者  没有一天不是在恐惧中度过
And now the days passes, the survivors forced to live in a barrier cities.

8
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,920
我发誓要结束这种恐惧
Do not live in fear. I have vowed to the end that fear.

9
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
我的梦就是解决一切的钥匙
I believe my dreams hold the key.

10
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,220
问题是我还来得及拯救地球吗
The question is, Will I be in time to save the Earth?

11
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,900
旧纽约城

12
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,030
你在哪?
Where are you?

13
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,230
这是限制区域
This is a restricted area.

14
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,230
别动
Do not move!

15
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,240
-她在这做什么  上尉?-我不知道。我们在带她出去。
-What is she doing here, captain? -I don't know, but we are getting her out.

16
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,230
-你跟我们一起走 -在你后面
-You're coming with us. -Behind you!

17
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
抓住它
Hold it right there!

18
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,440
该死的  行动吧
Damn it! Let's move, people.

19
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,250
有两个从墙穿过来
Two, coming through the wall.

20
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,250
别开枪  那些桶容易起火
Alright, hold your fire.

21
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,250
莱恩  尼尔  我们走吧
Ryan, Neil, let's go.

22
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,270
-你究竟在做什么 -这有一种生命形式
-What the hell do you think you are doing? -There is a life form in here.

23
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,870
-这里已经多年没有生命体了 -但是现在有
-There hasn't been life here in years. -There is now.

24
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,280
是不是生命形式  我要带你回去
Life form or not, I'm not leaving without that life form.

25
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,270
逮捕我  但不带上它我是不会走的
Gonna be one of those days.

26
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,270
没办法  算了吧

27
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,300
上尉  交通舰不会等我们那么长时间的
Captain, principal is not going to wait any much longer.

28
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
我明白
I understand that.

29
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
很不好
It's in bad shape.

30
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,310
告诉我我们不是为了这株植物玩命的
Please. Tell me when I am risking for this plant.

31
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,310
我都不会把它叫做植物  一棵野草而已
I won't even call it a plant. It's wheat.

32
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,710
我都不会把它叫做野草
I won't even call it a wheat.

33
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,310
我需要一分钟把它取出来
I need a minute to extract it.

34
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,320
小姐  我们恰好没有这一分钟了
Miss, that's the minute we do not have.

35
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,720
恐怕他是对的
I'm afraid his right about that, ma'am.

36
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
幽灵  我们有敌人了
Captain, we have incomings.

37
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,620
-上尉  我们要行动了 -明白  中士
-Captain, we need to get out from here. -Understood, sergeant.

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,330
-能不能快点  小姐 -完成
-Could you hurry please, miss? -Done

39
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,330
-上尉 -怎么  尼尔
-Captain. -Yes, Neil.

40
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,330
我同意  我们快离开这里
Just all you know, I agree with. Let's get out from here.

41
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,330
非常同意

42
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,330
能给我这个吗?谢谢
Can I have this please? Thank you.

43
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,880
-我们被包围了 -噢  混蛋
-We're surrounded. -No! Shit!

44
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,850
-大家别紧张 -上尉  我们得到高处去
-Alright, everybody. Just relax. -Captain, we got to get to higher ground.

45
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,360
每个人  到上面去
Everyone, up to top.

46
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,550
快  快  快！
Go! Go! Go!

47
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,370
-交通舰  要求立即撤退 -收到
-Transport requesting immediately event. -Confirm.

48
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,360
上这里来
Up here!

49
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,370
-上尉…上尉  快点… -我们就在你后面
-Captain! -We are right behind you.

50
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,250
我抓住你了
I got you.

51
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,390
-你没事吧 -还好
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

52
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,950
大家注意  他们来了
Alright, everybody. Here they come.

53
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,430
你没事吗
Are you okay?

54
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,430
你会没事的

55
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,430
为什么我不能把你抓起来呢
Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't arrest you?

56
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,940
我是阿琪・罗斯博士  我有到这里来的许可
I am Dr. Aki Ross. I have clearance to be here.

57
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,440
不是无限的许可  没有授权…
Not unlimited clearance. And not without authorization.

58
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
我没时间说这些
Captain, I don't have time for this.

59
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,440
你知道吗?你在拿我这班战士的命冒险
Do you realize you have just risk the lives at my squad and me?

60
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,450
听着  我不想说  但事实是
Look. I don't want to talk about it. The fact of the matter is,

61
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,050
牺牲你和你手下这些男人的生命也值得
it was worth the lives of you and your men.

62
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,050
“你和你手下这些男人”?
You and your men?

63
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,550
-她认为你是男人 -我认为她是白痴
-She thinks you are a man. -I think she's an idiot.

64
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,450
-我知道你不是男人 -我认为你也是白痴
-I know you are not a man. -I think you're an idiot too.

65
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,760
有趣
Very funny.

66
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,360
我正想谈谈
But I do want to talk about it.

67
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,460
你就没想过  给我们选择机会  我们会自愿的
Did it occur to you that maybe we are not volunteer to risk our lives?

68
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,760
没人让你救我
Nobody asked you to save me.

69
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,950
我真不敢相信  你一点也没变
I can't believe this. You have not changed a bit.

70
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,460
格雷
Gray?

71
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,470
见到你很高兴
Yeah, nice to see you too.

72
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,770
第42号堡垒城市：纽约市

73
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,840
-欢迎回来  上尉 -我们很干净
-Welcome back, captain. -We're cleaned.

74
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,540
-我们要确定一下 -我讨厌接受扫描
-Let's make sure of this, shall we? -I hate getting scanned.

75
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,550
对我们来说  这也许比幽灵还要糟
Sir, the scan probably worth to us than the phantoms..

76
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,450
有人怀疑这些机器可能会引起不育症
This machine are suspected to causing sterility.

77
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,320
我可还想有朝一日有个小尼尔叫我爸爸
And I want to have a little new junior to call me daddy someday.

78
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,060
-是个大胆的想法 -你为什么总是挖苦我?
-That's a spooky thought. -Why are you always busting my chop?

79
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,560
让我们都来扫描  好吗
People, let's just do this thing. Alright.

80
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,550
-是  长官 -是  长官
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

81
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,580
好  下一位
Okay, next.

82
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,380
你胖了
Looks like you gain some weight.

83
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,780
这叫上身的力量  尼尔  找个女朋友吧
It's called body strength, Neil. Get a girlfriend.

84
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,580
我在努力
I'm working on it.

85
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,550
你知道我的安全级别允许我不用扫描
You know my security rating allows me to bypass this.

86
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,390
今天不行
Not today, it doesn't.

87
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,590
有些不对劲
Something's not right.

88
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,590
-关于这次任务还是那个女人 -都有
-About this mission or that woman? - Both.

89
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,600
下一位
Next.

90
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
听着  上尉  我想…
Listen, captain. I think...

91
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,400
我不管你想什么  博士
I don't care what you think, doctor.

92
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,890
你也要接受检查  就像其他人一样
You're getting scanned just like everybody else.

93
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,610
混蛋
Oh shit!

94
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,610
-上尉 -他感染了幽灵
-Captain! -They got him.

95
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,310
一定出错了
There must be a mistake.

96
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,620
你曾经与幽灵接触过  长官
You came in contact with the phantom, sir.

97
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
请保持镇静
Please remain calm.

98
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,420
启用防护盾
Administering treatment shield.

99
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,010
-他在什么水平 -蓝色  3分半钟后会变到红色
-What level is he? -Blue. He will be coded at 3 1/2 minutes.

100
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,630
我们必须现在给他治疗
We have to treat him now.

101
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,330
抱歉  但是不行  我们要把他转到治疗中心
I'm sorry. That's impossible. We'll transfer him to the treatment center.

102
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,250
没时间了
There's no time for that.

103
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
把他扶到桌子上
Take him to the table.

104
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,730
坚持住  上尉
Hang on, captain.

105
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,550
确定病原体位置
Locating particles.

106
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,700
天哪  看
Jesus! Look at that thing.

107
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,970
还有多少时间
How much more time?

108
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,670
不够了  他到达红色区时  防护盾也不能封锁病原体了
Not enough. When he reaches code red, the treatment shield won't be able to hold the aliens particles

109
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,560
使用生物激光
Engaging bio-ethereal laser.

110
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,690
-出什么事了? -它跑哪去了?
- What's going on? - Where does it go?

111
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,490
究竟出什么事了
What the hell is going on?

112
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,900
失去跟踪了  感染正向深处发展了
We lost contact. Infer station is moving deeper.

113
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,250
-追踪 -没时间了
- Dragging. - There is no time.

114
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,500
-追踪 -没时间了
- Dragging. - There is no time!

115
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,700
你救不活他的
You're gonna lose him.

116
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,710
他的防护盾正在减弱

117
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,700
发现了
Founded.

118
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,710
快点

119
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,960
没事了
It's alright.

120
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,500
不用担心  你很快就会恢复的
Don't worry. You'll be back to normal in no time.

121
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,770
博士我们要检查你是否被感染
Doctor, we need to scan you for in infer station.

122
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,460
那就不必了  我会负责的
That won't be necessary. I'll take responsibility.

123
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,680
博士
Hey, Doc. 

124
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,180
谢谢你救了他
Thanks for saving him.

125
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,480
-你没事吧 -嗯  但军方没收了我的宇航船
-Are you alright? -Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship

126
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,590
她有什么秘密
What's with her?

127
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,590
她和上尉之间有什么秘密
And what's with her with the captain?

128
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,890
她和那傻植物之间有什么秘密
What's with her and the stupid plan?

129
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,780
什么
What?

130
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,100
给我幽灵数据  以及关于五个灵魂  我们到现在为止收集到的一切资料
Forward me the phantom data and everything we got in the file spirits collected so far.

131
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,000
是  博士
Yes, Doctor.

132
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,910
我想我们不应该用复数词
Spirits? I thought we are not suppose to use the S word.

133
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,510
别跟我较真
Don't get smart with me.

134
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,500
现在看看这株植物能为我们做什么
Let's see if the plant does the trick.

135
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,230
提取植物波形

136
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,730
匹配可能的波形

137
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,750
匹配

138
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,830
是匹配的  我们找到了
It's a match. We've found it.

139
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,830
是的  第六个灵魂
Yes, the 6th spirit.

140
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,430
你几乎违反了每个协议
A little scene today brought me every protocol

141
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,840
你认为在堡垒城外它能存活多久
How long do you think this would have survive outside the barrier?

142
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,330
有人正等着把我们排斥在外
Aki, you know there are elements in the Council military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.

143
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,330
10年前谁在幽灵身上发现了这种能量?是你
Look. 1 0 years ago, who discovered the energy and the phantoms? You.

144
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,840
谁证明这种能量存在人类和一切生命形式中
And who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?

145
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,850
还是你  你也使控制这种能量成为可能
You.  You made the possible to harness that energy 

146
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,860
并且用于“卵包”、扫描器甚至堡垒城
for overpacks, scanners, even the barrier.

147
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,850
委员会知道  他们信任你  我们就要证实…
The Council knows that. They trust you, Doctor. We are so close to proving...

148
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
我们还需要这些
We still need this part and this one here.

149
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,870
对  再有两块就揭开谜底了
Exactly. Two more pieces and we solve the puzzle.

150
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,870
我们要解决思想才能找到
We need to be free to find these pieces.

151
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,870
我给你看样东西  阿琪
I want to show you something, Aki.

152
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,880
-这是什么 -念
- What is this? - Read.

153
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,880
所有生命都源于盖亚  每个生命有一个灵魂
All life is born of Gaya and each life has a spirit.

154
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
每种灵魂都有寄存于一个物质的身体… 博士
Each new spirit is housed in physical body. Doctor...

155
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
继续
Go on.

156
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,880
通过他们在地球的经历  每个灵魂会成熟长大
Through their experiences on Earth, the spirits mature and grows.

157
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,890
当肉体死亡
When the physical body dies,

158
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,880
充实了地球上的经历  成熟的灵魂返回盖亚
the mature spirit enrich by it's life on Earth returns to Gaya.

159
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
把经验也随之带走  让盖亚能够存活成长
Bring in with it the experiences, enabling Gaya to live and grow. 

160
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
这是我的日记
To my old diary.

161
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,900
我43年写的  那里我像你现在一样大
I wrote that 43 years ago when I was the age you are now.

162
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,910
希德博士
Dr. Sid!

163
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,920
还记的伽里略吗  被关进监狱
I don't know what happen to Gary Will. They threw him into jail 

164
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,920
只是因为他说地球不是宇宙的中心
because he said that Earth was not descendant of the universe.

165
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
我们也会有同样的遭遇
That could happen to us.

166
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,920
我们的观点并不普及  阿琪
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.

167
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,930
如果你有不利于你的记录
If you have any notes or records, it could be used against you.

168
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,930
销毁掉
Destroy them.

169
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,930
-保存在这里 -好的
-Keep them up here. -Right.

170
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,940
离你那上尉朋友远点
And stay away from your friend, that captain.

171
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,940
他救了你的命  你救了他的  一来二去
He saves your life, you save his life. That's least to that.

172
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
我也曾年轻过
I was once young too, you know.

173
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,640
博士  战争正在进行
Doctor, there is a war going on.

174
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,740
没有人会再年轻了
No one is young anymore.

175
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,310
委员会的女士们、先生们
Could you please explain why Zeus cannon was completed a month ago.

176
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,010
请你们解释一下

177
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,020
宙斯炮一个月前就完成了

178
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,720
如果我们攻击陨星  我们会从根本上消灭幽灵
If we attack their media with this, we will eliminate the phantoms at their source.

179
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
海因将军  冷静
General Hein, calm down.

180
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,020
上次会议我们表决6对2
At our last meeting, we voted 6 to 2 to postpone using the Zeus cannon.

181
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,620
延迟使用宙斯炮攻击狮子座陨星
To attack alienated media.

182
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,030
我们开会就是要再次就此事表决
We have reconvince today to vote on that very issue again.

183
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,040
我要让生物中心的指挥讲一讲
Now I would like to ask the director of the bio-ethereal center to speak.

184
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
希德博士  请
Dr Sid, please.

185
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,340
谢谢

186
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,040
正如你们所知  幽灵的巢在…
As you all know, the phantom nested 

187
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,050
34年前到这里的狮子座陨星
the alienated media that landed here 34 years ago.

188
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,040
你们现在看到的是对陨星的每次攻击记录
What you see now, are the records of assault on the media to date.

189
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,260
物理攻击毫无效果
Physical attacks here had no affect.

190
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,060
这是三月前的一次全面轰炸
This seems to place 3 months ago joining a full scale of art.

191
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,060
请注意陨星以外的幽灵确实被消灭了
Please note that the phantom outside the media are indeed destroyed.

192
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,070
然而许多原来在陨星内部休眠的却被激活了生命
However inside, many that come to live.

193
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,060
如你们看到的  总体上幽灵密度也没有改变
And as you see over all phantom density remains the same.

194
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,080
异星生物应对这种攻击的方法是
The newly recent aliens response to the attack.

195
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,080
潜入地球更深处
By burly, even deeper into the Earth.

196
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,080
我对此很有兴趣  希德博士
Now this is very interesting to me, Dr. Sid.

197
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,080
因为我们看到了在手术中看到同样的事
Because we see the same thing during surgery.

198
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,080
当我们对幽灵分子使用生物激光束不也遇到类似的情况吗?
When using bio-ethereal laser on phantom particles. Do we not?

199
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,090
是的  确实如此
Yes, indeed we do.

200
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,090
受伤的分子逃跑了
You see the injured escape,

201
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:34,100
逃向病人身体深处
burying or digging themselves deeper into the patient body.

202
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,090
我们增加激光能量破坏这些深入的分子时
When we increase the laser power to destroy these deep particles.

203
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:43,110
会导致病人更大的伤害
We have had incidents resulting and further injury to a patient.

204
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,110
有时候  甚至是死亡
And in some cases, death.

205
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,110
这到底意味着什么  博士
And what exactly does that mean, Doctor?

206
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,110
这意味着很有可能
It means there is a very good chance to

207
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:55,120
宙斯炮的光束会烧掉陨星上的幽灵
being from the Zeus cannon built in the phantoms in a media.

208
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
正是这样  谢谢
Exactly. Thank you.

209
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,110
光束能量也许太强  会破坏地球
However, it also means that the being energy maybe too strong injuring the Earth.

210
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,130
破坏地球?
Injure the Earth?

211
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,130
你是说盖亚
You mean the spirit of the Earth?

212
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,120
-我是说… -你是说地球的灵魂?
Yes. The spirit of the Earth.

213
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
是的

214
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
地球的灵魂

215
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,540
他说什么?

216
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,540
你在做什么

217
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,550
我知道我在做什么  闭嘴
I know what I'm doing. And whatever you do, keep you mouth shut.

218
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,550
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

219
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,550
博士  以您所有的威望
Doctor, with all the respect.

220
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,550
你是来谈盖亚理论的吗
You come here just to talk about some Gaya theory?

221
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,560
告诉我们这个星球是活的
Tell us the planet is alive?

222
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
有一个灵魂
Has a spirit?

223
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,560
那是童话  很遗憾我们没有时间
That's a fairy tale, Doctor. Sorry, but we don't have time for that.

224
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,950
那不是童话  是真的
It's not a fairy tale, it's true.

225
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,570
如果我对地球开一枪
So if I point a gun to the Earth and fire, 

226
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,570
我不只打出个洞  而是在杀害地球
I'm not just making a hole on the ground, I am killing the planet.

227
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,580
希德博士  盖亚理论还没证明
Dr. Sid, the Gaya theory has not been proven.

228
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:57,070
即使盖亚存在  我们不是还要把幽灵移走吗
Even the Gaya does exist. We still have to remove the phantoms.

229
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,580
有成功的机会我们就要抓住
I think if there is any chance of success. We should take it.

230
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,590
-你同意吗? -当然
- Don't you agree? - Of course I do.

231
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,590
但是除了太空大炮外  还有种选择
But there is an alternative to this space cannon

232
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,590
另一种
Another method?

233
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,580
-使幽灵失去能力的一种方法  -请说
-Yes, I mean of disabling the phantoms. -Please.

234
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,590
众所周知外星人表现出一种独特的能量形式
we know that the aliens display distinct energy pattern

235
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
两个相对的生物被  互相叠加  彼此削弱 
Now it is a fact that two bio-ethereal waves places one over the other will cancel each other out.

236
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,610
理论上可以合成一种  与幽灵能量正好相反的波形
It's the erectile possible to construct the wave pattern direct opposition to the phantom energy.

237
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,220
我们正合成这种被并且即将完成
We are currently assembling...

238
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,620
诸位委员会成员  从全世界收集植物和动物
Members of the Council, gathering plants and animals

239
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,610
来对抗幽灵实在是一派胡言
from around the world to fight the phantoms is other nonsense.

240
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,630
加农炮是一种已经证实有效的武器
The Zeus cannon is a proven effective weapon.

241
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,630
会杀死幽灵
It will kill phantoms.

242
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,630
我们还能等什么疯狂的发明吗
Can we afford to wait for some crazy inventions

243
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,330
敏感的植物和动物的大军
Some army of touchy feeling plants and animals

244
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,640
而对消灭异星生物根本起不到什么作用
An invention with no solid evidence that will destroy the aliens.

245
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
有证据
There is evidence.

246
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,650
我们部分完成的能量波已经
Our partially completed energy wave has

247
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:08,550
成功阻止了一位持久性感染的病人体内幽灵的扩散
a terminally successfully stopped phantom particles from spreading through a terminally infected patient.

248
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,660
博士  你能证据表明这位病人已经治愈吗
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence that terminally patient has been cured.

249
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,660
没有治愈  波还没完成
Not cured. The wave is not completed.

250
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,750
但我们已经成功将分子控制在病人体内
But we have succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient.

251
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,670
证据在哪里呢
Where is the proof?

252
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,660
这里
Here.

253
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,690
阿琪  也许你为我们争取到一些时间  但是以什么代价呢
You may have bothered sometime, Aki. But I wonder what caused?

254
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,690
博士  你保护我时我也不能总躲在后面
Doctor, I can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me.

255
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,690
我也要让我所剩下的生命有意义
I want what life I have left to mean something.

256
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,700
听着  当我们发现第七第八灵魂
You listen to me. When we find the 7th and 8th spirits...

257
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,700
如果能发现  我们现在需要的是运气
If we find them, what we need now is some luck.

258
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,700
运气一点也没有用
Luck has nothing to do with it.

259
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,710
信念与勤奋  姑娘
Fate and hard work, girl.

260
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,000
因为你要在我之前死去  我会受诅咒的
Cause I'll be damn if you die before me.

261
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,740
委员会决定推迟使用宙斯炮
The Council decided to postpone firing the Zeus cannon.

262
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,740
我猜因我演了场好戏
I guess I put on a good show.

263
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,740
如果我也跟着不介意吧
Mind if I take a look?

264
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,140
你会觉得无聊的
You'll probably get bored.

265
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,750
那么  那你在做什么
So what are you doing?

266
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,770
我明白了  你是无声的抗议
Oh, I see. Giving me the silent treatment.

267
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,760
我在扫描这城市  以寻找第七灵魂
I am scanning the city for the 7th spirit.

268
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
快点  尼尔
Hurry up, Neil.

269
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,790
-差不多了 -你在做什么
-I almost got it. -What do you think you are doing?

270
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,790
我们想让他们一起呆一会
We just gonna strengthen them for a while.

271
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,790
别看我  这是他的主意
Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea.

272
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,790
是你的主意
It's your idea?

273
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,800
我们正在帮助上尉
We just help the captain up a little.

274
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
简  你的浪漫细胞呢
Come on, Jane. Where's your sense of romance?

275
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,790
你看到了上尉看她的样子
You see how the captain looks at her.

276
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,810
懂吗  孩子
It's a more, baby.

277
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,810
发生什么了
What's going on?

278
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,810
也许哪出了点小毛病
Probably just a glint.

279
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,820
-我说  阿琪… -我对你仍然很生气
- Listen, Aki... - I'm still mad at you.

280
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
-你疯了? -你不摘下头盔  也不告诉我你是谁
-You are mad at me? -Leaving your helmet on and not telling me who you were?

281
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,420
那太孩子气了吧
That doesn't seem a little childish.

282
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,810
你去宙斯站时一句话也没说  我很伤心
I was just a little upset when you dispatched and leave the Zeus station without saying a word.

283
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,830
-现在你知道发生什么了 -是的
-Now you know what's going on, alright? -Now I know.

284
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,830
我的工作必须在零重力下进行
My operation had to be done in zero graph, okay?

285
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,830
好
Fine!

286
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,240
我到那去办事时你甚至不来看我
How about the fact that I was sent there on the job and you won't even see me?

287
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,840
我也许正在帮助希德博士收集灵魂波
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collected the spirit wave.

288
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
-现在我知道了 -对不起
-Now I know. -So I'm sorry.

289
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,830
我也是  我俩一样
Well, me too. So we are both sorry.

290
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,850
你能讲讲他们吗
So would you tell me about them?

291
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,850
关于什么
About what?

292
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,860
你收集的灵魂啊
About the spirits you collected.

293
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,860
在一次实验中我被幽灵感染了
I was infected by the phantom during an experiment.

294
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,860
-一般无人会活下来 -你怎么做到的呢
-Normally no one could had survived. -How could you?

295
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,870
西德博士在感染区制造了保护膜  我才活了下来
Dr. Sid created a memory around the infection keeping me alive.

296
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,870
因此第一个灵魂波是我
So the first spirit wave was me.

297
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,870
第二个是条鱼
The second was a fish.

298
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,870
鱼
A fish?

299
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,870
第三个是头鹿  我在莫斯科郊外的野生动物保护区发现的
The third was a deer I found in a wildlife-preserved outside Moscow.

300
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
第四个是只鸟
The fourth was a bird.

301
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,880
你试过在外太空追踪一只麻雀吗  一点也不好玩
Ever try to track a sparrow out of space? It's no fun.

302
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,890
-不管我怎么说  你也许会喜欢上的 -是  我也许会的
-What am I saying? You probably would love that. -You are right. I probably would.

303
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,890
然后就是我从时代广场收集的那植物
And then there was that plant I collected from Time Square.

304
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,890
-我想那是第六个了 -什么
-I thought that was number 6. -What?

305
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,890
你漏了一个
You skipped one.

306
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,390
第五是医院急救室里垂危的一个小女孩
The fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room.

307
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,900
我及时抽取了标本  但她…
I retrieved the disabling time, but she...

308
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,900
我告诉她一切都有灵魂  狗、猫、树、小女孩
I told her everything has a spirit. Dogs, cats, trees, little girls, 

309
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,920
甚至是地球
even the earth.

310
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,120
我说她不会死  只是回到地球的灵魂――盖亚
I told her that she wasn't dying, just returning to the Earth spirit. The Gaya.

311
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,420
她跟我说她准备死
She... told me that she was ready to die.

312
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,520
她说我不必编故事哄她开心
She said I didn't have to make up stories to make her feel better.

313
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,940
只有7岁就要死了
Only 7 years old and ready to die.

314
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,940
对不起
I'm sorry.

315
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,340
我有事要做  我一定要找到第七第八灵魂
I have work to do. I have to find the 7th and the 8th spirits.

316
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,950
请不要
Don't... please....

317
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,960
你一点也不相信这些  是吗
You don't believe any of this, do you?

318
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,950
我只是不知道  阿琪
I just... don't know, Aki.

319
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
这就是为什么你拒绝我
Is this why you shut me out?

320
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,970
你该告诉我
You should have told me.

321
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,970
我不知我还有多少时间
I don't know how much time I left.

322
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,960
谁知道
Who does?

323
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,870
我最好回来继续扫描的工作
I better get back to scanning.

324
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
爱德华上尉
Captain Edwards, 

325
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,790
你几天前从旧纽约救了一个罗丝博士  对吗
you extracted a Dr. Ross from old New York several days ago. Did you not?

326
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,110
-是的  长官 -你对罗丝博士印象如何
What were you impressions of Dr Ross?

327
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,010
她显得非常干练坚毅
She seems very capable and determines.

328
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:11,010
现在给你和深邃眼睛小队暂时分配一个任务
You and the Deep Eyes are being temporary reassigned.

329
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,020
罗丝博士再去荒原时  你保护她
You will guard Dr. Ross when she re-enters the waste land.

330
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
明白  长官
Understood, sir.

331
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,820
你还不明白  上尉
You don't understand yet, Captain.

332
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,710
罗丝博士有任何异常举动  立即报告少校
Report any ebullient behavior in Dr Ross to the Major immediately.

333
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,030
异常行为  长官?
Ebullient behavior, sir?

334
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:29,720
她被这异星生物感染  我们不知这对她有何影响
The woman carries an alien infer station, captain. We don't know what it maybe doing to her.

335
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,040
异星生物的存在也许影响她的判断 
The aliens presence could be effecting her judgement.

336
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,040
也许会控制她以实现它们的目的
And maybe manipulate the Doctor for their very own purposes

337
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,030
将军怀疑罗丝博士是间谍?
Is the General suggesting that Dr Ross is a spy?

338
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,050
将军在奇怪他为什么要亲自向一名上尉解释
The General is wondering why he explains himself to a captain.

339
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,050
她长时间的暴露在幽灵组织下
She separated long exposure to phantom tissue

340
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,050
如果这开始显露
If this begins to manifest itself in anyway,

341
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,530
罗丝博士将会被逮捕并送到这里来观察
Dr Ross is to be placed under arrest. And transport here for observation.

342
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,060
事实上这是为了她好  上尉
It is in fact for her own good, captain.

343
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,060
当然  长官
Of course, sir.

344
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,070
少校  安排一些我们的人看着上尉
Major, send some of our man to keep an eye on our good captain.

345
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,180
我认为这些梦是信息传达的一种方式
I'm convinced these dreams are some form of communication.

346
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,180
只是我还在困惑它们表达什么
The message still elude to me.

347
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,170
但它们来得更快了  这只能意味着一件事
But they are coming faster now. And that can only mean one thing.

348
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,190
我体内的幽灵开始占上风
The phantoms inside me are beginning to win

349
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,190
-我们的目标是图森以西50米 -收到
-Our target is to discrete at two sign. -Roger.

350
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,890
-幽灵密度? -不好  到处都是巨型的
-Phantom concentration. Not good. -We got big minutes everywhere.

351
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,200
将会是场硬仗
So it's gonna be a real picnic.

352
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,200
跟紧我  不要逞英雄  一切按书本
Stick close to me. No heroin today, okay? Everything by the book.

353
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,990
按照书本  是的
By the book, alright.

354
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,590
图森荒原

355
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,210
如果我们丢下能量标在这里  这里  和这里
If we drop energy here, here and here.

356
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,220
我们就能获得目标并在他们发现我们以前离开
We should be able quiet at the target and get out even before the phantoms know we were there.

357
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
能量标会吸引幽灵?
And that would attract the phantoms.

358
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,350
-是的 -只是一会
For a while.

359
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,230
你是从第307号来的  海因将军的部下
So you are from the 307s, right? Under General Hein? 

360
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,230
以前做过荒原侦察吗?可能很难看的
Have you done any wasteland recon before? And get pretty ugly.

361
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,160
长官  撤退的集合点在航线6、坐标279
Captain, rendezvous at sector 6 coded 279.

362
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,850
收到  注意警惕敌人
Roger that. Stellar for hard files.

363
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,280
看来他们中了陷阱
Looks like they are taking a bath.

364
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,310
第七幽灵应该在失事地点附近
The 7th spirit should be just beyond the line.

365
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,320
生物如何在这里生存?
I don't see how any living thing could survive out here.

366
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,720
很快我们就会知道
You'll find out soon enough.

367
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,320
这里曾是清除幽灵战役
This was the phantom cleansing mission.

368
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,320
本来是用来结束战争的
It was supposed the end of war.

369
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,020
我的父亲就在这里的某个地方
My father is in here somewhere.

370
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,340
好了
Alright. 

371
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,130
我们过去吧  各位
Let's move out, people.

372
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,350
我完了
I'll be damn.

373
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,360
一个生存者
A survivor.

374
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
它在这里干什么?
What is it doing out here?

375
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,860
希望生命能回来
Hoping for life to return.

376
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,370
那是我们的灵魂吗  博士? -不
-Is that our spirit, Doc? - No.

377
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,380
我们正在接近那生命形态
We've closing in on a life form.

378
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,780
-距离? -很难说  我们很近了
Distance?Hard to say.We are very close.

379
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,380
我看不到任何东西
I don't see anything.

380
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,390
-你不会告诉我是他吧?-那是不可能的
-You're not gonna tell me it's him. -That's impossible

381
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,410
不是这个士兵  是他的“卵包”
It's not the soldier. It's his overpack.

382
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,410
怎么会?“卵包”给我们的武器和堡垒城市等提供能源
How do you explain that? Packs? Power or weapon? The barrier cities?

383
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,410
这只是生化能源
I mean it's just by with theory energy.

384
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,420
我们是用生物组织来制造能源的  单细胞的生物
And to create that energy, we use living tissue. Single cell organism.

385
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,420
-他的背包就是第七幽灵? -是的
-You're telling me his backpack is the 7th spirit. -Yes.

386
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
有情况  上尉  你听到我吗?
Captain, do you read me?

387
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
再说一次?
Once again.

388
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,430
有敌人来了
Captain, we have incoming.

389
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,420
莱恩  去拿士兵的卵包
Ryan, get the soldier's pack.

390
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,240
我需要帮手  中士
I need a hand, sergeant.

391
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,250
-那些能量标?他们没用了 -是的  谢谢
- Those boys. -Yeah. Thank you.

392
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,460
-你没事吧? -当然
Are you alright? -Of course I am.

393
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,450
我们离开这里吧
Let's get the hell out of here.

394
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,470
有些不对劲  这不应该发生
Something is not right. It should be happening.

395
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,470
有东西在吸引他们
Something are tracking them.

396
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,470
阿琪！
Aki...

397
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,470
-它们正在追我们  靠近得很快 -简  你领路
-There are right on us, sir. -Closing fast.Jane, take the lead.

398
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,490
我要发射啦！
Fire the hole!

399
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,510
带我们离开这里  尼尔
Get us out of here, Neil.

400
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:34,510
-长官  我很想  可是… -快点
Sir, I would love to. But... - Just do it!

401
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,540
好了  原来是这样
- Sir? - Locate that seat.

402
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,550
看上去不好  上尉
That doesn't look good, captain.

403
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,550
我们得把她带去医院
We have to get her to a hospital.

404
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,550
-你必须遵守命令  长官 -到底这么回事?
-You have your order, sir. -What the hell is happening here?

405
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,550
罗斯博士现在被收留了
Dr Ross is to be taken into the custody now.

406
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
放下你的武器  这是命令！
Lower your weapon. That's an order.

407
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,760
长官  我们别无选择  只能撤销你的指挥权
We have no choice but to relief you and your command.

408
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,570
我不会让你这么做的  除非你射击我
I won't let you do this, soldier. You'll gonna have to shoot me.

409
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,560
退后  上尉！
Bend down, captain!

410
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,850
阿琪！
Aki!

411
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:53,650
大家坚持住！
Hang on, everyone!

412
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,350
够了  所有人  把手举到我看得见的地方  现在！
That's enough! Everyone down. 

413
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,670
深遂眼睛  右满舵！

414
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,680
尼尔  尽快把我们送回纽约！
Neil, get us back to New York. Fast.

415
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,700
深遂眼睛小队从荒原回来了  长官
The device are returned from the wasteland, sir.

416
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,710
显然发生了一件事
Apparently there was an incident.

417
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,710
幽灵都被罗斯博士吸引了
It would seem the phantoms were attracted to Dr Ross.

418
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,710
小队人员险些没能逃出
The crew barely escaped with their lives.

419
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,720
而且  长官  爱德华上尉仍然是指挥者
And sir... Captain Edward is still in command.

420
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
发布一个命令
Issue an order.

421
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,720
我要逮捕爱德华和罗斯博士
I want Edward and Dr Ross to be place under arrest.

422
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,520
与希德博士的波理论有关的所有研究资料立即全部没收
All research materials pretending to Dr Sid wave theoryare to be confiscated immediately.

423
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,730
这可能和委员会有冲突
That might not go over too well with the Council, sir.

424
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,730
真是个悲剧啊
What a tragedy that would be.

425
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,720
这真完美  少校  这位好上尉为我们提供了机会
This is perfect, Major. It's too good the captain has opened the door for us.

426
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,740
到明天早上  委员会会服从我们
By tomorrow morning, the Council would bear our feet.

427
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,740
感谢我们揭示出背叛者
Thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us.

428
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,150
并恳求我们从幽灵手中救他们出来
To save them from the phantoms.

429
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,750
她怎么样了  博士?
How is she, Doctor?

430
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,760
-她快死了 -你一定要救她
-She is dying. -There must be something you can do.

431
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,760
阿琪在和6个幽灵作战
Aki is fighting with only the 6th and 8th spirits.

432
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,760
我们得将第七个装置在她的胸板
We have to implant the 7th directly into her chest plate.

433
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,760
那里中了一枪  它可能坏了
It took a bullet. I think it might be damage.

434
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,770
我们得尽快修理这个胸板
We have to appear this panel quickly.

435
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:48,550
她的生命迹象正在减弱  阿琪快离开我们了
Her vital signs are dropping. Aki is slipping away from us.

436
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,170
她需要一个有同情心的灵魂把她留在这个世界
She needs a sympathetic spirit to help her held hold in this world.

437
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,780
我想没有谁比你更合适这任务了  上尉
And I can think of no spirit but to suit for that task but yours, captain.

438
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,770
-我不明白 -你不需要明白
-I don't understand. -You don't have to understand.

439
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,790
现在你只要和她在一起
You just be with her now.

440
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,780
你将她留下来
You'll keep her here with us.

441
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,850
阿琪?我们在哪?
Aki, where are we?

442
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,850
在一个外星球
On an alien planet.

443
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,850
这怎么可能?
How is that possible?

444
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,850
我也不确定
I'm not entirely sure.

445
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,860
你看来很平静
You seem pretty calm.

446
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,860
几个月来我每天做这个梦
I have been having this dream every night for months.

447
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,860
做梦?
Dream?

448
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,860
不管它是什么
Well, whatever it is.

449
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,870
你真的在这里  是吗?
You're really here, aren't you?

450
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,870
我到底发生了什么事?
What's happening to me?

451
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,860
希德在你身上装入第七个幽灵
Dr Sid is implanting the 7th spirit directly into your body.

452
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,880
那你就是我的心灵助手
Then you are my spiritual support.

453
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,880
格雷  你真好
Gray, how sweet of you.

454
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,870
我想你不明白事情有多严重
I don't think you realize how serious this situation is.

455
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:49,880
你应该看这里的东西  长官
Something you should see here, sir.

456
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,900
我看的是什么  少校?
And I am watching... what, major?

457
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,910
罗斯博士好象记录了她的梦
It seems Dr Ross has been recording her dreams.

458
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,910
我为什么要对她的梦感兴趣?
And why would I be interested in it... her dreams?

459
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,910
这就是我们的证据
This is it. This is our evidence.

460
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,910
她在幽灵的控制下
She's under influence of the phantoms.

461
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,710
罗斯博士  这些梦可以让委员会批准宙斯大炮
Dr Ross's dreams should be all the Council needs authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.

462
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,930
委员会宁愿躲在堡垒里面
The Council is contempt to hide powering inside this barrier

463
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,930
坐视世界一天一天的死亡
while the world dies a little more everyday.

464
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,930
我认为需要在正确的方向上推动他们一下
I believe they need a push in the right direction, major.

465
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,930
请你组织一群最可靠的人
Get another a group of your most trusted men.

466
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,990
他们在干什么?他们为什么看着我们?
What are they doing? Why are they staring at us?

467
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,980
不是看我们
Not at us.

468
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,040
欢迎回来  上尉
Welcome back, captain.

469
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,050
结束了吗?
Is it over?

470
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,050
她怎么样  博士?
How is she, Doctor?

471
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,050
她没事  可是这是短期的
She is going to be fine. But this is only temporary.

472
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,050
我们需要找到第八个和最终的灵魂才能救她
We need to find the 8th and final spirit to cure her.

473
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,050
阿琪  听得到我吗?
Aki, can you hear me?

474
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,070
我完成了
I'd finished it.

475
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,070
我知道它的意思

476
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:52,070
我知道幽灵是什么了
I know what the phantoms really are.

477
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:56,070
不许动！你们都被逮捕了！
Nobody move! You are all under arrest!

478
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:09,090
我们已经逮捕他们了  长官
We have them, sir.

479
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,090
长官?
Sir?

480
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:14,090
我的妻子和女儿…
My wife and daughter.

481
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:19,100
在旧金山堡垒城被幽灵杀了
Were killed by phantoms in San Francisco when the city was attacked.

482
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,090
我告诉过你吗?
Did I ever tell you that?

483
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,110
我试着去想象
I try to imagine what...

484
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:32,100
你周围的人没理由的死去
How is that like seeing everyone around you, fall over dead with no apparent reason.

485
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,110
最后  你感到有东西在旁边
And then at the end, you're feeling something next to you.

486
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,120
看不见  触动你
Invisible... touching you.

487
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,120
进到你的身体
Reaching inside your body.

488
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:50,130
你也曾失去了家人  是吗?
You've lost family, haven't you?

489
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,130
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

490
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,140
所以我信任你
That's why I trust you.

491
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,140
你们全部
All for you.

492
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,130
你们知道应该做的事
You know what must be done.

493
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:05,750
堡垒控制中心

494
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,150
覆盖安全限制

495
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,560
侵入周边

496
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,150
出什么事了?

497
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,160
少校  逮捕这些人
Major, arrest these man.

498
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,160
放松点站起来．去

499
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,150
你可以休息了  别问问题

500
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,170
降低到第31区的能源
Reduce power to sector 31.

501
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,170
长官  你应该知道幽灵…
Sir, you do realize that the phantoms...

502
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:31,170
我知道的是  少校…我们得强迫委员会去行动
What I realize, major is that we must force the Council to take action against the enemy.

503
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,190
阿尔法能源通道的25%已转移
25% % of energy redirect.

504
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:49,190
降低到第31区的能源
Over ring power put to sector 31.

505
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,090
第31区的屏障被破坏  将军  他们过来了
Bury the bridge in sector 31, General. They're coming through now.

506
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,190
我们能应付几个在封闭空间里的幽灵
I think we can easily handle a few phantoms in a contain space.

507
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,190
放松  少校  今晚结束后  你就会成为一个英雄
Relax, major. When this night is over, you are going to be a hero.

508
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,210
-阿琪  我不认为… -你在我的梦里  格雷  你看到了
-Aki, I don't think... -You were in my dream, Gray. You saw it. That's just it.

509
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:10,210
我不确定我看到的是什么  你如何确定?
I'm not sure what I saw. How can you be?

510
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,210
上尉  请让她继续
Captain, please. Let her continue.

511
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:16,220
你想我们为何不能知道
Why do you think, we've never been able to determine 

512
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,910
像人一样大的幽灵和在荒原上活动的大幽灵之间的关系?
a relationship between the human size phantoms. And the giant one's roaming away slants.

513
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,230
对不起  博士  究竟是什么关系?
Excuse me, Doc. But frequent relationship.

514
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:29,230
你有像人一样大的幽灵  毛虫一样爬的幽灵
I mean you got your human size phantoms and your creepy caterpillary phantoms.

515
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:32,230
会飞的幽灵  别忘了还有我喜欢的
And your flying phantoms. And let's not forget my personal favorite.

516
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,240
肥大幽灵
The big fat giant phantoms...

517
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,240
-坐下  小子 -他说得对
-Down, boy. - He's right.

518
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,240
如果你像我们在战场时间久了
If you spend as much time in this field as we have.

519
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,240
你就知道没什么关系  那里好象一个动物园
You know there is no relationship. Is like a zoo out there.

520
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,050
正是如此  我想巨型幽灵象我们的鲸鱼或大象
Precisely, I think the giant ones are like our whales along for the ride?

521
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:50,240
那为什么一个军队会带些鲸鱼和大象来入侵?

522
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,260
除非他们的船象疯狂的挪亚方舟?
It must be the ship of some kind crazy known as ark.

523
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,260
我们一直以为陨星是用作交通工具的
We always assume that the media was intended as a form of transportation.

524
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,260
但不是
Perhaps it wasn't.

525
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,670
陨星是它们星球的一部分  当他们毁灭了它们的世界时被抛进了宇宙里
The media is a chunk of their planet. They got thrown into space when they destroyed their world.

526
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,360
可是在外太空旅行时它们如何在一大块石头上生存?
But how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?

527
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:13,260
它们没有生存下来
They didn't.

528
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,280
噢  听上去有些道理了
This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.

529
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
上尉  你认为呢?
What do you think about all this, captain?

530
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,290
我想这就是为什么我们没有机会
I think that explains why we never had a chance.

531
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:27,290
我们所有的策略只是根据一个假定
All our strategies are based on one assumption.

532
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,290
我们是在和外星侵略者作战
That me are fighting alien invaders.

533
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,300
想想那个梦  格雷  他们如何死的
Think of the dream, Gray. How they die?

534
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,300
从那以后  他们只知道受苦
Since then, all they know is suffering.

535
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,300
他们不是侵略的军队
They are not an invading army.

536
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,300
他们是鬼魂
They are ghosts.

537
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,310
有多少幽灵?
How many phantoms?

538
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,310
足够能说服委员会
More than enough to convince the Council, sir.

539
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,300
很好  发一个警报  派一个班去消灭他们
Excellent. Send the squad out to eliminate them.

540
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:50,300
是  长官
Yes, sir.

541
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,320
警报状态：全面部署

542
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,320
长官  我有许多的幽灵接触
Sir, I have numerous phantoms contacts.

543
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,320
当然
Well, of course you do.

544
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,320
在第31号外面  并迅速的移动
Outside sector 31, sir. And moving in incredible speed.

545
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,320
到底发生什么事?
Major, what the hell is going on here?

546
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,330
他们在导管里
They are in the pipes.

547
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,330
他们在利用生化能量来移动

548
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:10,330
不可能  没有生物能在这些导管里生存
That's impossible. No living thing could survive in those pipes.

549
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:14,330
有个大的朝这边过来  巨型的  长官
Well, we got a big one heading this way.

550
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,350
哦  天啊
Oh my god...

551
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:28,340
别开火！
Hold your fire!

552
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:16,390
我做了什么?
What have I done?

553
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:38,410
快点  尼尔  我们需要办法  你是我们可靠的人  快想办法
Come on, Neil. We need to find a way out. Now think.

554
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,430
上尉  这些墙是钛合金做的  这屏障是脉冲激光
Captain, these wall titanium alloy. And the bars are all pole sonic lasers.

555
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:47,420
我不能晃一下魔棒…
I mean is not like I can just wave a magic wont and...

556
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:52,430
-尼尔  我很感动 -我也是
-Neil, I'm impressed. -That makes two of us.

557
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:56,440
前往最近的撤离地点
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.

558
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,440
前往最近的撤离地点
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.

559
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,430
我想我们应该前往最近的撤离地点
I think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.

560
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,470
-他们来了 -还有其他的！希德博士！
-Here they come. -But the others... Dr. Sid!

561
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:33,460
深遂眼睛队员会保护他的  我们走吧
Deep Eyes will take care of him. Come on!

562
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,480
出了什么事?我们为什么现在能看到他们?
What's happening? Why can we see them now?

563
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,480
他们一定是带着屏障上的残留电荷
It must be carry resistible charge passing through the barrier.

564
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:54,490
注意你后面！
Behind you!

565
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,550
全部到齐  上尉
On the board, captain.

566
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,630
我们需要去找我的船
We must find my ship.

567
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:07,630
如果它被拖回来  它应该搁在飞机棚里
If it was towed inside the city, it could be in the military hangar.

568
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:11,620
注意这是很重要的如果
That's a big 'If'.

569
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,630
注意
Look out!

570
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,640
-把我们带到平台上去 -明白
- Get us out of the platform. - You got it.

571
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,670
好了  现在怎么办?
Okay, now what?

572
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,670
我们要穿过车站
We're going through the station.

573
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,670
-什么? -上尉  和所有有关系的
- What? -Captain, with all respect...

574
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:54,680
对不起  长官
- Excuse me, captain...

575
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,680
我们要去的
We're going through it.

576
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,680
这是唯一的路
It's the only way.

577
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,680
我看这是个困难的行程
Should I gather all this will be somehow a rough ride.

578
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,690
你很会低估啊
Doc, you got a talent for understatement.

579
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:08,680
坚持住  各位
Hang on, everybody.

580
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,710
博士?
Doc?

581
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,720
很有意思
Interesting.

582
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,710
-有没有人受伤? -上尉
-Anybody hurt? -Captain!

583
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,730
哦  天  和我说话 中士
Oh God! Talk to me, sergeant.

584
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:49,730
噢！

585
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,730
-帮我一下  简 -好
- Give me a hand, Jane. - No, wait!

586
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:55,740
别动  这太危险了  可能伤得更重要找一些适当的工县  把他弄出来
We're risking for the injury. We need the proper tools to cut him out.

587
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,740
在我的船上有
They are in my ship.

588
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,740
-不  不  博士  别用药 -上尉?
-No! No, Doc.No drugs. - Captain...

589
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,750
你听到了
You heard the man.

590
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,750
我们会找到船的  我们会回来找你
We'll find the ship and we'll be back for you.

591
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,750
-我和他留下 -我也是
- I'll stay with him. - Me too.

592
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,750
谁也别留下
Nobody's staying.

593
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,750
给我一支枪
Just give me a gun.

594
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,750
给他一个武器  去！
You got it. Give him a weapon.Do it!

595
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,760
我们会为你回来
We'll be back for you, sergeant.

596
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,760
你听到没?
You hear me?

597
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,770
我听到了  上尉  现在  离开这里
I hear you, captain. Now get out of here.

598
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:28,760
我们快走吧
Let's move out.

599
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,820
四轮的ATV  这个很棒
Aqua isolated T.V. This is good.

600
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:23,830
它可用来接莱恩  并将他安全带回来
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.

601
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:27,830
但是我们需要换掉这些燃料罐
However we need to replace this plane's fuel

602
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:30,830
在飞机棚里可能些“卵包”
There could be some lives overpack in the hangar.

603
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,840
简  去检查飞机棚  尼尔  准备起飞
Alright, Jane. Check the hangar. Neil, get us ready for take off.

604
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,840
阿琪和希德博士  准备好着陆车
Aki and Dr. Sid prep the quad troll.

605
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,840
我去指挥塔  转航道
I'll go to the tower and rotate the air track.

606
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,830
这城市或许完了  但不是我们  让我们快一点离开
The city maybe lose. But we are not. Let's do this thing and get the hell out of here.

607
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,860
格雷  小心
Gray...Be careful.

608
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,850
你也是
You too.

609
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:43,890
哦  是的
Oh yeah.

610
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,920
尼尔  能听到我吗?
Neil, do you read me?

611
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,920
大而清楚  长官
Loud and clear, captain.

612
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,910
这宝贝能自己起飞
This baby would fly itself.

613
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:10,930
飞行路线安置好了
Flight plane is set.

614
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:14,930
开始旋转
Beginning rotation.

615
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,940
停止航道碟  我们有个问题
This is not the air track. We have a problem.

616
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,940
一个扣押的拖拉机连接在船上
I'm reading an impound tracks detach to the ship.

617
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,950
你能否将它分离?
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?

618
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,950
批准离开到外面去分离连接
No, sir. Permission to go outside and detach the cockpit.

619
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,940
去吧
Do it!

620
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,950
问题就在这里
There is the problem.

621
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:53,960
控制器自己锁住了
The controls are locked naturally.

622
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,980
简  我想问问你  我们可以活着离开这里吗?
Jane, let me ask you something.You think we're going to get out here alive?

623
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,980
我不知道有没有人离开过这里
I mean I'm wondering if anybody is getting out

624
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,990
你认为有人能做到吗?
You think anyone had made it this far?

625
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:06,990
这个第八个灵魂真的能对付幽灵?
You think this 8th spirit stuff is going to work and chase out all the phantoms?

626
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:10,980
如果它们只是一派胡言怎么办?
I mean what if it is all a bunch of mambo jumbo?

627
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:15,990
简  我们能不能停止说话  我需要专心
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking? I gotta concentrate here.

628
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:30,010
下面发生什么事?
What's happening down there.

629
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:34,000
没有不能处理的
Nothing we can't handle.

630
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:48,030
-尼尔  怎么样了? -快好了
- What's your status? - Almost there.

631
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,030
你们俩快回里面来

632
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:54,040
我们很好  长官  简正在带着偏见谈判
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating with the extreme residents.

633
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,040
和我说话  简
Talk to me, Jane.

634
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:01,030
这里没有问题  上尉
No problem here, Captain.

635
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:08,040
好了！上尉  我们可以出发了
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.

636
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:33,450
不！
No!

637
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,090
简  离开那里
Jane, get out of there.

638
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:52,090
现在就离开那里！快走  简！
Get out now! Go!

639
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:56,090
快离开那里！简！
Get the hell out of there! Jane!

640
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,130
防卫屏已经准备好
Unseal the power and ready.

641
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:25,630
你去哪里?
Where are you going?

642
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,630
去驾驶室  船现在是自动驾驶的。
To the cockpit. The ship is set on autopilot

643
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:29,130
起飞已经倒数时了
We are in countdown to leave off.

644
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:33,120
等一下  这太危险  阿琪！
Wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!

645
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,150
这边  畜牲！
Over here. You son of the bitch.

646
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:28,250
格雷  你听得见我吗?怎么回事?
Ryan! Gray, do you read me? What's happening?

647
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,250
你和希德要离开这里
You and Sid are getting out of here now.

648
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:34,260
-不行！我们不能留下大家 -大家都死了
-No! We can't just leave everyone. -Everyone's dead.

649
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:38,750
-我不要离开你 -对不起  你没有选择余地
I'm sorry. But you don't have a choice.

650
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:44,250
再见  阿琪
Goodbye, Aki.

651
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,290
格雷  快点！

652
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:29,430
我只是
I just... 

653
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:33,420
我希望他们能在更好的地方
I wish I could believe they are in a better place.

654
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,370
宙斯

655
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:19,670
目标确认

656
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,570
我放大了扫描范围
I enlarge the scanning parameter to include an area.

657
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,570
包括了以前我们忽略的地点

658
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:50,570
冲击坑
The impact crater.

659
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,570
寻找第八灵魂的奇怪地方
That's the strange place to find the ex-spirit.

660
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:54,580
是很惊人
Yes, really.

661
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:57,580
除了幽灵  没有东西能在那里生存
But nothing can survive there except phantoms.

662
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,580
准确
Precisely.

663
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,580
这说明第八灵魂就是个幽灵
We suggest that the 8th spirit is a phantom spirit.

664
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:05,590
现在我不能做解释  不过当我们下去后…
I can't explain it until that moment. But once we get down there...

665
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,590
-你就会明白 -等等  博士  那是有去无回
-You'll understand... - Wait. That's the one way trip.

666
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:12,590
这就是你对我们机会的评估
Yes. Yes, I expected that's how you'll valuate our chance.

667
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,590
我错了吗?
What am I wrong?

668
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:15,600
不  我同意  我们可能…
No, I agree. We'll probably 

669
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,600
不能活到把第八灵魂取出来
won't live long enough To extract the 8th spirit from the crater...

670
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,600
那为什么要做?
Then why should we try it?

671
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,600
因为我们不需要提取第八灵魂
Because we don't need to extract the 8th spirit.

672
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,010
如果我们不能把这最后的灵魂取到这
We can bring the final spirit here.

673
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,610
我们可以进去和陨石坑里完成波型
We can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.

674
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:29,610
完全正确
Yes. Exactly.

675
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:31,610
那么我们究竟从何做起?
And how do we do that... exactly?

676
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:33,610
我可以建造一个装置
I can construct the device.

677
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:37,610
能够连接到阿琪的胸板并提取第八幽灵  然后…
That would attach to Aki's chest plate together the eight spirits and then...

678
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,620
然后呢?
And then what?

679
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:44,630
然后我们就等一会  看看会发生什么
And then we wait. And see what happens.

680
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,630
就这样?
That's it?

681
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:50,630
这就是你的计划?等待一会?
That's your plan? We wait and see what happens?

682
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:54,640
很好  我也有我的计划
Yes. Oh good. But I got my own plan.

683
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,640
我们从轨道继续扫描它表面
We keep scanning the surface of orbit.

684
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,840
或许我们能在其它地方找到匹配的灵魂
Maybe we'll find the compatible spirit somewhere else.

685
01:14:58,850 --> 01:14:59,630
阿琪
Aki?

686
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,630
我说我们进去吧
I say we go in.

687
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:11,030
海因将军  您可以进入阿尔法01
General Hein, you're clear to go in to the zero one alpha.

688
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:35,670
是什么使屏障失效  海因将军?
What caused the battle failed, General Hein?

689
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:41,680
我想幽灵能产生出对我们屏障的抗体  只是时间的问题
I'm afraid it's only the matter of time before the phantoms develop into immunity to our barriers.

690
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,690
很高兴看到你和委员会
But I'm ready to see you and the rest of the Council

691
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:48,690
能平安撤退到休士顿
to evacuate to Houston without incident.

692
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:51,690
今晚我们损失惨重
It was a terrible suffer this evening.

693
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:54,700
委员会重新考虑你的建议去发射宙斯炮
The Council had reconsidered your proposal fire the Zeus cannon.

694
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,700
我知道了
I see.

695
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,250
我们现在传送密码给你
We are transmitting the access code to you now.

696
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,700
将军  愿我们都好运
And General, best of luck to us all.

697
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:09,710
准备发射大炮
Prepare to fire the cannon.

698
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:12,710
目标  长官?
Target, sir?

699
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:16,720
幽灵陨石坑
The phantom crater.

700
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:27,110
里海山脉：幽灵陨石坑

701
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:45,740
准备投放  三  二  一
Prepare to drop in three, two, one.

702
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,740
启动防护屏障
Powering the shield.

703
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,760
我们已经过了陨星
Okay, we are over the mini one.

704
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,760
你能看见它吗  博士?
Do you have it inside, Doctor.

705
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,760
他们有很多
There are so many of them?

706
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,770
等一下
Wait. 

707
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:09,360
是的  我在弹坑的表面搜寻第八灵魂
Yes. I'm tracking the 8th spirit moving along the crater surface.

708
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:13,760
好的  让我们靠近点去看看
Alright. Now let's take a closer look.

709
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,820
三分钟后发射准备就绪
Ready to fire in 3 minutes.

710
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:59,310
卵包能量最大  自动传送等离子体流
Overpack set maximum. Transferring class to other.

711
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,820
反推进器启动
Counter thrusters are engaged.

712
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,830
流通离散  绿色状况
Locks flow the couple. Status is green.

713
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:08,820
雷达显示陨石冲击处有东西  长官
We have something in the radar over the impact side, sir.

714
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:11,830
是她
It's her.

715
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:13,830
长官?
Sir.

716
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,840
是个受敌人控制的背叛者
Just a traitor on the influence of the enemy.

717
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,840
继续倒计时
Continue the countdown.

718
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,830
我们把他们全部同时全消灭
We'll take them all out at the same time.

719
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:28,840
我们接近幽灵了  30秒后接触
We're closing on the phantom. Contact in 30 seconds.

720
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,850
目标锁定
Target locked.

721
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:35,850
等候你的命令即可发射
Ready to fire on your command.

722
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,860
是匹配的！  完美的匹配！
It's a match. It's a perfect match.

723
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,850
-扫描器就绪 -发射
-Target's cannon is ready, sir. -Fire!

724
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,900
那是什么?
What was that?

725
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,900
是宙斯炮  他们在炸陨石坑
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.

726
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,910
-阿琪  上尉  你们还好吗? -有一点摇晃  等一下…
Aki, Gray, are you alright? -A little shaking. Stand by.

727
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:29,400
希德  第八灵魂不在我们的扫描器上  你有没有?
Sid, the 8th spirit is not on our scanner. Do you have it?

728
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,910
第八灵魂…已经被消灭了
The 8th has been destroyed.

729
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,610
-我们现在怎么办? -任务已经结束了
-What are we going to do now? -Nothing. This mission is over.

730
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,910
-我们离开这里吧 -有情况
-We have to get out of here. -Incoming!

731
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:14,960
那是什么?
What is that?

732
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,950
你如果要让我们出去  最好就是现在
If you gonna get us out of here, you better do it now.

733
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:33,960
等一下
Hold on! 

734
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,970
我不能抓住你
I can't hold on to you.

735
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:50,980
不能保持高度
I'm not able to maintain.

736
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,990
紧急降落程序
Emergency landing procedures.

737
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,030
进来  请进来
Come in, come in, please

738
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,030
阿琪  格雷  你们能听见我吗?
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?

739
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:33,020
希德  我需要和空间站谈话  你能不能帮我们接过去?
Sid, I need to talk to the station. Can you pass us through?

740
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,040
那个是什么东西?我不知道  长官
What is that thing? I don't know, sir.

741
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,040
消息传入  长官
Incoming message, sir.

742
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,040
海因将军  你必须马上停止发射
General Hein, you must cease fire immediately.

743
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,050
你看到的是外星人世界的幽灵
What are you looking at, in the crater is the living spirit of an alien's home world.

744
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:51,050
他们的星球被毁灭了  星球的部分降落在这里
The planet was destroyed and part of the it landed here.

745
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:54,050
这不是入侵  从来就不是
This is not an invasion. It never was.

746
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:59,860
我知道了  我们一直与之战斗是什么  博士?幽灵吗?
Oh, I see. And what we have been fighting all this time, Doctor? Ghosts?

747
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:03,060
是的  迷失  混乱  和生气的灵魂
Yes, spirits that are confused, lost and angry.

748
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:06,070
是的  这些幽灵是从盖亚神而来的
Oh right? And these spirits are coming out of the Gaya,

749
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:08,070
海因将军  你必须听

750
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:12,070
外星的盖亚  地球的盖亚  博士  即使我相信这些
Earth Gaya. Doctor, even if I believe in such nonsense.

751
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:15,080
事实仍然是地球被一个侵略者袭击
The fact remains the Earth is under attack

752
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:18,080
我们必须不惜一切代价消灭它
from aggressor who must be destroyed at all cost.

753
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,080
而这代价可能是整个星球的  长官
The cost maybe the entire planet, sir.

754
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,080
袭击外星的盖亚只会让它更加强大
Fire on the alien Gaya would only make it stronger.

755
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,980
既然你受外星人的影响  博士
Since that you under the alien influence, Doctor.

756
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:30,090
我想你的抗议只能说明我们正在采取正确的行动
I will take your protest to mean, we are in fact persuading the correct course of action.

757
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:35,080
预备好你们最后的时刻准备去见盖亚
I suggest you take your last few months and prepare to meet your Gaya.

758
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:39,050
继续射击直到侵略者被毁灭
Continue to fire until the invaders have been destroyed.

759
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:17,140
将军  系统过热
General, this is the mis-over-hitting.

760
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:21,140
我们继续袭击直到它完全灭亡
We are going to hit again and again. And keep on hitting it, until it's dead.

761
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:24,140
可是我们不确定这是不是有用
But sir, we not even sure if it has any affect on the other creature.

762
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:27,150
没有用? 我们令他们逃跑  军人
No affect. We got them in the run, soldier.

763
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:31,740
这是我们胜利的时刻  我命令你发射
This is the moment of our victory. order you to fire.

764
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:36,150
-系统不允许我们再发射 -让我们看一看吧
-This won't allow us to fire again. We'll see about that.

765
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:41,150
我们的防护屏没了  我们在这是坐以待毙  快点
Now shield is out, we're seeking Doc in here. Come on.

766
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:06,180
这不是个好地方
This is not a good place to be.

767
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:16,200
那是什么?它是我想的东西吗?
What the hell is that? That's something I'm thinking, is it?

768
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,200
是的  是盖亚
Yes! It's Gaya.

769
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:22,200
这决不是个好地方
Definitely not a good place to be.

770
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,200
你没事吧?
Are you alright?

771
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,200
我没事  我必须和希德博士说话
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.

772
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:09,250
希德  你听得到我吗?
Sid, do you read me?

773
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,250
可以  我还在这里
Go ahead. I'm still here.

774
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:16,260
我们看见了盖亚  你听到了吗  希德?盖亚
We are looking at Gaya. You hear me, sir? Gaya!

775
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:20,250
这就是为什么第八灵魂出现在这里
I think this explains why the ex-spirits appeared here.

776
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:25,270
是的  这就对了！
Yes. Yes, that's it.

777
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:28,270
一个幽灵变成了第八灵魂
A phantom must have changed into the 8th spirit

778
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:31,270
从我们的盖亚里出生
when it starts a new life born on our own Gaya.

779
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:35,280
如果是这样  它可以得到一个不同的能源记号
If so, it would have been given a different energy signature

780
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,280
把它和其他幽灵区分开来
that set apart from the other phantoms.

781
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:44,280
这里是找一个新的匹配灵魂最好的地方了
You two could not have hope for better location to find a new compatible spirit.

782
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,280
不管你做什么  别动  停留在那里
Whatever you do, don't move. Stay right where you are.

783
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:53,290
留在这里不是你想的那样容易
Staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sound.

784
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:56,300
不要射击他们！
Don't shoot any of them.

785
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,300
你很可能毁掉我们最后的希望
You could destroy our last hope.

786
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:02,300
你有什么提议?请他们态度好一点吗?
And what do you suggest I do, Doctor? Ask them to play nice?

787
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:06,300
战斗策略是你的专长  上尉  不是我的
Combat strategy is your area of expertise, not mine.

788
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:10,310
我看到在裂缝里有指示  你看到没有?
I have a reading here in official. Do you see it?

789
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:15,300
有的！是一个匹配的幽灵  它一定很靠近你
Yes, a compatible spirit. It must be very near you.

790
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,320
哪一个是它呢?
Where? Which one is it?

791
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,320
哪一个?
Which one?

792
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:23,310
很难看清  请等一下
I'm having difficulty now. Just a moment.

793
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:29,320
这里很拥挤  阿琪  我们没有时间
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here. We don't have much time.

794
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,720
阿琪！阿琪！！
Aki...Aki!

795
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:03,420
为了新生命的希望
With the hope of new life,

796
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:07,420
盖亚有没有改变里面的幽灵?
has Gaya changed the phantom within?

797
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:16,430
我找到它了
I have it.

798
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,440
格雷  进里面来  我需要你
Gray, get in here. I need you.

799
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,450
听见没有  希德?波型图完成了
Do you hear me, Sid?The wave pattern is completed.

800
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:30,450
是的  我听到了  这太棒了
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.

801
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:33,450
我不知道你怎么找到最后的灵魂
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.

802
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:37,460
是它找到我  博士
It found me, Doctor.

803
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,460

我现在知道了  懂了
I see now. I understand.

805
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:46,470
我不明白！怎么回事?
I don't understand. What the hell is going on?

806
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:48,470
给我你的卵包  我需要它来发射完整的波
Give me your overpack. I need to project it in the complete way.

807
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:52,470
-但是我们就会失去防卫 -你就给我吧！
We'll be defenseless.

808
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:56,480
-我希望你知道你在做什么  阿琪 -我们可以用它来发射波
-I hope you know what you are doing, Aki. -We can use the shield to project the wave.

809
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,480
-什么? -希德博士的理论是对的  我找到了  第八幽灵
Dr Sid's theory was right. I have it, the 8th spirit.

810
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
我已经复原了  格雷
I'm cured, Gray.

811
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,490
-你确定你有最后的灵魂吗 -是的  我确定
-Are you sure you have the final spirit? -Yes, yes. I'm sure.

812
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:08,490
-你如何知道? -别担心  一个幽灵告诉我的
-But how? How can you know that? -Don't worry, the phantom told me.

813
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:10,490
哦  很棒
Oh, great.

814
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:14,480
好了  防护屏启动
That's it. Shield on.

815
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,500
它不行了  我们得在太迟之前想点办法
It's not working. We have to do something before it's too late.

816
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,500
如果这个不行  那么就真是太晚了
If this doesn't work, then it's already too late.

817
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:34,510
格雷  相信我
Gray... trust me.

818
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:03,530
我要把你们炸到地狱去

819
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:12,540

-警告  系统超载 -我知道
-Warning system overload. -I know.

822

-警告  系统超载 -我知道
-Warning system overload. -I know!

823
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:44,570
可是必须完成
But it must be done.

824
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,630
发射
Fire! 

825
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:28,630
发射  王八蛋！
Fire! Damn it!

826

不要离开我  格雷
Don't leave me, Gray.

829
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:54,710
早就告诉希德这是有去无回
I told you this was an one-way trip.

830
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:56,720
看来我说对了
Looks like I was right.

831
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:59,720
不  格雷  坚持一下
No, Gray. Hang on, please.

832
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,720
我仍然有波
I still have the wave.

833
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:05,710
我们可以解决的
We can get through this.

834
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:11,730
我们做不到  我们做得到
We are going to make it. We are going to make it.

835
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:15,720
我们都知道那不是真的
We both know that isn't time.

836
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:26,740

You saved my life once. Now I want you to save yourself.

840
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,770
格雷  不要  拜托！

841

让我来吧  阿琪  相信我

不要离开我  格雷

843
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:05,180
你一直在努力告诉我死亡不是结束
You have been trying to tell me death isn't the end.

844

848
01:37:52,350 --> 01:38:01,150
群星落泪

849
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:08,250
天堂叹息

850
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:11,950
世界终了

851
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:17,450
释放内心的梦想

852
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:22,150
神秘莫测

853

歌声在召唤

862
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:43,950
你内心的祈祷

863
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:48,050
将指引你

864
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:53,750
