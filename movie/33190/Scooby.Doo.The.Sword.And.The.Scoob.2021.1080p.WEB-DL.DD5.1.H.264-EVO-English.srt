1
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:25,217
Do you like my toupee,
Barbarian?

2
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:26,483
Demon dogs!

3
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,519
He's taken a piece of
Ookla's mane

4
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:30,588
and used it
to cover his bald spot.

5
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:33,390
Why can't cat people
just grow old gracefully?

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,036
<i>Ariel, Ookla! Ride!</i>

7
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:55,613
Huh?

8
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,631
There's a creature on the wing!
It's attacking the aluminum.

9
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,234
Shaggy!

10
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:18,203
I've got you, Scoob!

11
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:28,179
Like, whatever you do,
don't look behind you.

12
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:30,081
Behind me?

13
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:31,917
No! Don't look behind you.

14
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,488
Well, like,
don't look down either.

15
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:39,723
That's cowardice 101, Scoob.

16
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,003
Now, Scoob!

17
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,710
It worked!

18
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,980
Come on, Velma.
Let's reel him in.

19
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:07,685
Yeah!

20
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:18,762
Wow. A real-life monster
here in my hangar.

21
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,564
I can't believe
you kids caught it.

22
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:22,666
Not an "it," Mr. HB.

23
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,604
Herman Ellinger.

24
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:31,709
That's the rude passenger
from B17. But why?

25
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,879
Why? Because airline tickets
cost an arm and a leg.

26
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,349
I knew if I could scare
your passengers away

27
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:38,984
you'd have to lower
your prices,

28
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,585
and I could fly almost anywhere
for practically nothing.

29
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,923
Yeah! Airline prices
are the real monster.

30
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,790
I don't think
you get discounts for...

31
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,625
And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

32
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:51,396
if it wasn't for you meddling
kids and that mangy mutt of yours.

33
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,696
Hey!

34
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,973
I can't thank you kids enough.

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,541
But I still don't know
how you figured it out.

36
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,378
Easy. With science.

37
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:09,314
After the first sighting
of the monster, I had an idea.

38
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:12,150
I collected scraps from leftover
food served on the airplane

39
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,152
and cross referenced
the DNA samples

40
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,687
against the piece of hair
we found on the plane's wing.

41
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:18,323
Incredible.

42
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,993
DNA? Gee, that doesn't sound
like mystery-solving at all.

43
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,829
The only mystery is why anyone
would try to solve anything

44
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,865
without good old science
to back them up.

45
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:29,600
Say, uh,
there's two other papers here.

46
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,635
Oh, that's because
there were two extra people

47
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:36,007
that ate the food on the plane,
despite us asking them not to.

48
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,380
Uh-oh. What'd we do?

49
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:45,783
It looks like the lab ran your
DNA test along with Ellinger's.

50
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,453
Are you guys curious
where your ancestors came from?

51
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Huh? Denmark?

52
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,526
Well, you are a Great Dane
after all.

53
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:58,229
Emphasis on the "great."

54
00:03:58,296 --> 00:03:59,630
What about you, Shaggy?

55
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,900
It says my ancestors
come from a small village

56
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:05,736
in the north of England called
Norville o'er Morgania.

57
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:07,939
- Huh? What a weird name.
- Hmm.

58
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:10,041
It says here
that Norville o'er Morgania

59
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:14,345
is known to be one of the suspected
locations of the ancient city of Camelot.

60
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:19,217
Also, it says that it has the best fish
and chips in all of the United Kingdom.

61
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:21,119
- Fish?
- And chips?

62
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:27,425
Those were fries,
but I'm still on board.

63
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,060
I wish we could go, gang.

64
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,728
But we didn't go into
mystery solving for the money.

65
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,998
Well, Daphne was right
on one account.

66
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,101
Airline prices
are the real monster.

67
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,735
Well, it's lucky
I have an airline then.

68
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:40,637
What do you mean, Mr. HB?

69
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:42,140
What do I mean?

70
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,843
You just saved my whole airline
from bankruptcy.

71
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:49,147
I'll fly you and your friends
anywhere you wanna go, free of charge.

72
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,182
It's the least I can do.

73
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,785
Well, gang, I guess we're
headed to jolly old England.

74
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,889
That sure
was nice of Mr. HB

75
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,558
to ship over
the Mystery Machine.

76
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,459
It sure was.

77
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:10,929
Say, Fred, the map says you were
supposed to make a left back there.

78
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:15,066
Map? Oh, Daphne,
Jones men don't need maps.

79
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,635
We were born with
an innate sense of direction.

80
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,938
We were made
for the open road.

81
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,606
Fred!

82
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,812
Fred, you do know
that they drive

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,349
on the left side of the road
in England, right?

84
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,284
Boy. They built
the roads wrong...

85
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,120
Is this the one where the toilet
water goes the wrong way, too?

86
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:42,961
Say, look at that.

87
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:48,366
See? I told you
I knew where we were going.

88
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,670
Fred!

89
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,372
I got it.
Just testing you.

90
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,884
Wow. It looks like
they're about to have a party.

91
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,720
Good timing.

92
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:09,820
Party?

93
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,522
Oh, man. That means...

94
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,225
Party food!

95
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,729
"Fish and chips.
Bangers and mash. Toad in the hole."

96
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:22,233
"Welsh rarebit. Spotted dick.
Jam roly-poly."

97
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,935
Are these real?

98
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:27,839
I guess. "Bubble and squeak.
Jellied eels. Angels on horseback."

99
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,808
It's like
a whole new world of food.

100
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,650
Like, Scoob and I
are gonna go grab a snack.

101
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:40,351
We'll be right back.

102
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,254
This place is kind of a dump, gang.
Like, run-down.

103
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,990
Some of the architecture is
left over from medieval times.

104
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:51,729
Dudes, the place we're staying is all that
remains standing of the Kingdom of Camelot.

105
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:53,531
Camelot? Like King Arthur?

106
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,068
Merlin? Knights of the Round Table?
We're standing on history.

107
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,903
Weren't you just calling
this place a dump?

108
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,639
Yeah, but now it's a dump
where knights lived.

109
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:05,643
There's very little evidence that
Camelot or King Arthur even existed.

110
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,211
Oh, but he did.

111
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,647
That's what we're celebrating.

112
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:14,018
Hi. I'm Mr. Saunders,
the mayor of this fine city,

113
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:17,088
and this here is my assistant,
Sandi.

114
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:19,123
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

115
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm Daphne, and these are my
friends, Velma and Fred.

116
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:25,263
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

117
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,800
You seemed awfully sure that
King Arthur really existed.

118
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,034
How can you be certain?

119
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,570
Because of our name, of course.

120
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,907
Norville o'er Morgania.

121
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,212
You don't know the story?
Well, not many do.

122
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,115
But never fear.
Soon, everyone will.

123
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:49,320
It all began a long time ago,
right here, on the site of Camelot.

124
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,122
That's right.
The good King Arthur

125
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,858
came under attack by
the villainous Morgan Le Fey.

126
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:58,763
Everything seemed bleak until a
brave knight appeared. Sir Norville.

127
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,431
Known for his fearlessness,

128
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,534
this knight fought the evil
witch and saved Camelot.

129
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,170
Witches? Wizards? Come on.

130
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,172
Those stories
came out of the Dark Ages,

131
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,241
where nothing
could be accounted for.

132
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:13,678
A disbeliever. That's okay.

133
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:15,380
Stay in this town
a little while

134
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:18,983
and you'll experience
the magic yourselves.

135
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,985
The Mayor
has worked really hard

136
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,054
to make this
the greatest celebration ever.

137
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:25,590
We have horse races,
archery demonstrations,

138
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:29,193
an unbelievable light show
and even a pie-eating contest.

139
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,530
Did someone say pie eating?

140
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:34,499
And who is this?

141
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:38,002
My name's Shaggy,
and this is my pal, Scooby-Doo.

142
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,104
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

143
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:42,073
Shaggy's actually
the reason we're here.

144
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,210
It turns out that Shaggy's ancestors
are from Norville o'er Morgania.

145
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:48,079
Norville is a Shaggy name.

146
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:51,349
Yeah. My name's Norville.
Surname Rogers.

147
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,919
But, uh, nobody calls me "Sir."
That's my dad's name.

148
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:57,121
Oh, really? You're sure?

149
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:00,191
He's been a Norville his whole
life, and the DNA test proves it.

150
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:02,026
Norville's a name
that's been handed down

151
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,762
in our family, like...
Like, forever.

152
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,866
Just like this medallion.

153
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:09,700
My mom gave it to me for luck.

154
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,973
Luck, indeed.

155
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,642
We thought we'd look around.

156
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,411
Who knows? Maybe Shaggy's
ancestors left him something.

157
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:23,147
I'm hoping for some sort of
medieval pizza.

158
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,416
Or jellied eels.

159
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:28,386
Yes. Well, we have to be going.

160
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:33,591
- It can't be.
- Sandi.

161
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:36,160
You'll never guess
what just happened...

162
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,566
Did you hear...

163
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:46,671
- That was strange.
- Small towns are weird.

164
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:48,773
Remember that time
you dyed your hair blond

165
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,175
and everyone in that little
northeastern town was talking about it?

166
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:55,012
Oh, yeah. Being blond was
definitely not more fun that day.

167
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,582
And then they all turned into
fish people and tried to eat us.

168
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:59,484
That's less of
a "small town thing"

169
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,954
than it is
a "Scooby Gang thing."

170
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,088
Come on.
The library is this way.

171
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:05,790
How do you know?

172
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,459
The same way Scooby and Shaggy
always know where the food is.

173
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,902
I don't know, Scooby-Doo.

174
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,839
Are you getting that same sort
of haunted vibe as I am?

175
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:22,240
Uh-huh.

176
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,976
Doesn't everything give you
the haunted vibe?

177
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,143
It's called
managing expectations.

178
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,246
Don't worry, guys.

179
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,884
The only thing scary about this library
is it still uses the Dewey Decimal System.

180
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,619
Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

181
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:36,220
Unbelievable.

182
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:37,956
Next thing
you're gonna tell me,

183
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:40,424
they put the horror and
romance section side by side.

184
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,933
Hi. I was wondering...

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,034
Shh! This is a place of study.

186
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,004
Use your library voice, please.

187
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,071
Of course. I'm sorry.

188
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,711
Is it just me
or is this place dead?

189
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:01,847
Shh!

190
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:03,648
We were visiting and wondered

191
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:05,650
if you can point us to the books
on the history of your town.

192
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:09,487
Near the back,
past the horror and romance section.

193
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,556
Next to the horror
and romance section?

194
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:15,326
Sure. Because those genres
are so similar.

195
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:17,029
Exactly.

196
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:19,965
But you'll need to hurry. We're closing
in 20 minutes for the big party.

197
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,668
Why we should be celebrating such a
preposterous story, I'll never know,

198
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,203
but one must do
what one must do.

199
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,740
Okay. We'll be quick.
Thank you.

200
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,753
Hand luggage... Hobnockers...
Hypermarkets... Ham hocks...

201
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,391
Ooh. You can never know enough
about a subject you love.

202
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,467
Here it is. History of Sir
Norville and Morgan Le Fey.

203
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,814
Huh?
That can't be good.

204
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,249
It never is.

205
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:14,785
This seems to be
some kind of storybook.

206
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,387
Hmm.

207
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:23,194
<i>"Once upon a time,
there was a great ruler named King Arthur.</i>

208
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,431
<i>But this king was under attack
from the evil Morgan Le Fey.</i>

209
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:29,433
<i>She demanded the throne
from King Arthur,</i>

210
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,104
<i>but he would not give it up
to one as evil as her.</i>

211
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,373
<i>Everything was hopeless
until Sir Norville appeared.</i>

212
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,475
<i>Brandishing the mighty sword
Excalibur,</i>

213
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>Norville, through
a mighty tournament,</i>

214
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,146
<i>became the rightful ruler
of Camelot.</i>

215
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:46,183
<i>But no sooner
did he gain the throne</i>

216
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,786
<i>than Morgan Le Fey
attacked again.</i>

217
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:51,023
<i>Norville was whisked away
to Morgan's castle</i>

218
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,524
<i>where the two were
never heard from again.</i>

219
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:57,728
<i>King Arthur decreed that if Sir
Norville or his children ever returned,</i>

220
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,867
he would be crowned the rightful
ruler over all the land."

221
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,702
No wonder it
was called the Dark Ages.

222
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,906
Can you imagine
anyone believing such a story?

223
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,206
Ha! Right, gang?

224
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:11,475
Scooby? Shaggy?

225
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,377
Is the story over?

226
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:20,651
What do you know? The book was right.
This is a great hiding place.

227
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,730
Hey. Where's the party?

228
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,335
If ever you see a party not happening,
that means you're the party.

229
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,705
Come on, gang.
Let's heat this place back up.

230
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,452
Come on. If you dance it,
they will come.

231
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,054
No.

232
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,728
It's working.
Come on, party people.

233
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,566
Like, don't party people
usually arrive by land?

234
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:10,434
Not if it's a skydiving party.

235
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,871
Excuse me. Are you
the skydiving instructor?

236
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:17,109
I am Morgan Le Fey,
rightful ruler of Camelot.

237
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:22,047
And if it wasn't for meddling Sir
Norville, I would be ruler still.

238
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:23,849
Why is she pointing at me?

239
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:25,616
Are you not
the skydiving instructor?

240
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:29,921
Now, I shall finally
have my revenge!

241
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:31,822
You'll have to
catch us first.

242
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:35,593
Come on, gang!

243
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,334
A-ha!

244
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:07,159
That was so not a party person.

245
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,094
What was that thing?

246
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:13,564
She said she was the ghost of Morgan
Le Fey, but that's just preposterous.

247
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:17,002
On a scale of one to...

248
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:19,237
How preposterous
did you think it was?

249
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:21,940
Check it out, gang.
It's an old henge.

250
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:26,278
A circle of stones that once held
some sort of mystical significance.

251
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:27,711
Look at that.

252
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,716
Wow! Who do you think that is?

253
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:37,822
It says this is the statue of
the legendary Sir Norville.

254
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:43,627
Did someone say "Sir Norville"?
I despise Sir Norville.

255
00:16:43,694 --> 00:16:45,997
Well, good news, man.
I'm not him.

256
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:48,900
I'm Shaggy, and, like,
everyone loves me.

257
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,068
No joke.

258
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:53,571
There is no time for love.
Only retribution.

259
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,210
I invoke sorcery's paradigm.

260
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:02,746
With this eldritch and mystical
rhyme, I'll leave them bipedal,

261
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:07,986
but teach them to meddle and send
their butts backward in time.

262
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:13,124
I'm scared, Shaggy.

263
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:18,163
Me too, buddy.

264
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,499
- Is anyone else getting a bit...
- tired?

265
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:26,037
Tired? Oh, yeah.

266
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,422
Shaggy, where are we?

267
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:21,159
Like, I don't know, man.

268
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,261
Shaggy, Scooby, grab my hand.

269
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,171
We appear to be falling at the
standard 9.8 meters per second

270
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,907
as dictated by the Earth's
gravity, but where's the ground?

271
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:38,243
Skydiving's not a party, man.

272
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,177
I found the ground!

273
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:43,480
Brace for impact!

274
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:46,217
Huh?

275
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:48,819
Did we make it in one piece?

276
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:52,523
I can't feel my legs.

277
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,563
Like, I can feel my legs,
but I can't feel my fingers feeling them.

278
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:07,238
Where are we?

279
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:16,081
No bars. We should've gotten
the international plan.

280
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:20,818
Did I leave my curling iron on
in 1,600 years?

281
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:23,188
Morgan Le Fey
cast a spell on us.

282
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,956
Oh, come on.

283
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:28,226
I'm sure that was just some
kids playing some kind of prank.

284
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,995
Velma, look around.

285
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,730
You're telling me that there's
no way time travel could happen?

286
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,968
Well, I mean, wormholes,
black holes, Tipler cylinders.

287
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:39,471
But these are cosmic-level
events we're talking about.

288
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:43,975
So, like not fantasy, but science fiction?
Like Thundarr?

289
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,379
No. Thundarr's more
dumb fantasy than sci-fi.

290
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,947
But you like Thundarr.

291
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:52,083
I like Thundarr's abs, okay?
I watch it for the abs.

292
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,485
Me too.

293
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,353
So, wait. We time-traveled?

294
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,423
Welp, gang, it looks like we
have another mystery on our...

295
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,591
No. Not a mystery.
It's a hoax.

296
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,893
Then how did we time-travel?

297
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,627
We did not time-travel.

298
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:05,864
This is a prank,
or a Japanese game show.

299
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,699
We all just need to chill
and take a deep breath...

300
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,337
...and hold our horses.

301
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,342
Hmm.

302
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:19,411
You gotta admit,
Velma's usually right about this stuff.

303
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:23,915
Let's all just wait here
a bit and see what... Gang.

304
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:26,351
Gang. Gang. Gang. Gang.

305
00:20:26,418 --> 00:20:27,718
Gang.

306
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,121
It's real.

307
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:59,017
This can't be real.
It doesn't make sense.

308
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,219
This shouldn't be possible.

309
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:04,255
If I'd known I was gonna time-travel,
I'd have brought my good ascot.

310
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:07,992
I keep telling y'all,
reality is just a simulation.

311
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,061
Now's not the time
to worry about what's real.

312
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:14,199
That time is in, like, hundreds and
hundreds of years, where we should be.

313
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,800
Well, gang, it looks like we
have another mystery on our...

314
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,203
Ah, just you wait.

315
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:20,004
Any second now,
someone's going to pop out

316
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,140
and yell "Surprise"
or blow a horn.

317
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,011
Ha! Horn!

318
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:31,815
Hear ye! Hear ye!

319
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,384
I, Herald of the court,

320
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:36,653
doth ask you to bow
before the King of Camelot.

321
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,224
The lord of the land.
The knight of the...

322
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,724
Oh, get on with it.

323
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,594
Yes. Um...

324
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,166
Peasants and serfs, I give you
King Arthur and Queen Guinevere.

325
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:54,038
Ohh. He's kinda hunky.

326
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,008
I guess, if you're into
authoritarian dictators.

327
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:59,643
He kinda reminds me
of my dad.

328
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:05,950
Sorry. Sorry. New cape.
Haven't broken it in yet.

329
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,923
Say, he sure looks familiar.

330
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,463
Unwashed common people, I, your king,
and my brave Knights of the Round Table

331
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,968
have with great effort and sacrifice
finally defeated the villainous Saxons

332
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,004
and brought peace
to the isles.

333
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,972
I love your hair.

334
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,409
So, I'm throwing a party!

335
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,482
Uh... It's not a party
for you lot.

336
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:40,485
It's for me. The rightful king
of the Britons,

337
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:43,955
who made you the proud people
you are today.

338
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:47,492
Back straight. Chin up.
Mind the gap.

339
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,694
Now, I'm going to have
my Knights of the Round Table

340
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:53,364
come around
and collect some taxes.

341
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:00,438
Come on. Pony up.

342
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:03,441
Oh, and, Lancelot,
I'll take that pony.

343
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,880
He is like your dad.
A big meanie.

344
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:12,183
The unwashed common people don't
seem to like him very much.

345
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,852
Oh, my gosh.
You're right, Daph.

346
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,588
All right. Good talk.

347
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:18,323
Oh!

348
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:23,528
Oh, not again.

349
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:25,563
Greetings, Arthur.

350
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,099
It is I, Morgan Le Fey.

351
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:32,403
Come to take my rightful place
as ruler of Camelot.

352
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,940
Like, it's her!

353
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,181
Wend home to Avalon,
vile enchantress.

354
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:48,219
You call your folk fair,
yet I judge you anything but.

355
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:53,625
Oh, my gosh. Really? Really?

356
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:56,760
Ah. Ah, sorry. Sorry.

357
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,229
I had butter for lunch.

358
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:01,399
Cede the throne to me,
son of Uther Pendragon,

359
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:04,035
and I shall spare
your miserable life.

360
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:06,704
Uh, my life
is amazing, FYI.

361
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,373
Yeah. Shazing.

362
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:11,376
And also, I'm hiding
behind my knights.

363
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:15,246
You'd have to literally
tear them apart to get to me.

364
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:23,855
Well, if you won't give me the
throne, I'll just have to take it.

365
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:27,759
Oh!

366
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,131
King down. King down, everyone.

367
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,477
Huh?

368
00:24:55,219 --> 00:25:00,124
Soon you will all bow before
me, your true queen!

369
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,229
Huh?

370
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:09,400
It's just like the book
we read in the library.

371
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,668
What do you mean?

372
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,470
Remember when Velma was like,
"Blah blah blah.

373
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:15,907
Morgan Le Fey kept on annoying
Norville o'er Morgania"?

374
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,444
That's right.
Until Sir Norville appeared.

375
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,212
Sir Norville.

376
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,147
- That's it!
- Huh? What's it?

377
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:25,016
Why are you looking
at me like that?

378
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:30,822
Because maybe Sir Norville is
actually Shaggy sent back in time.

379
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:33,491
Me? A knight?
With this goatee?

380
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:36,527
Besides, I don't look
anything like the statue.

381
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:39,464
Oh, so now you're on the
time-travel train too, Velma?

382
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,834
You said it yourself, Daphne.
Science fiction.

383
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,169
Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic.

384
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:47,605
We do seem to have
traveled in time.

385
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,540
We just need
to find out how.

386
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,376
You can say it now.

387
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:55,246
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

388
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:57,215
If we're in the distant past,

389
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:59,450
then we're currently living out the
legend we read about in the future.

390
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,552
Oh, my brain hurts.

391
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,588
And if we're responsible
for the legend,

392
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:05,923
then we have to do
exactly what it said,

393
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,860
or otherwise we'll mess up
the timeline,

394
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:09,727
which could cause us
to cease to exist,

395
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:13,765
or worse, the whole universe may
implode in a quantum paradox.

396
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm telling you,
reality's a simulation, girl.

397
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,569
The universe can't implode
'cause it isn't even real.

398
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:20,938
Daphne, you're not helping
my stomach.

399
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,407
I look at you guys
and I just see

400
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:25,276
zero-one, one-one-zero-
one-one-one-zero.

401
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:28,346
Daph. Daph.
Hand me your phone.

402
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,849
Look.

403
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:32,650
As long as the lock-screen
picture stays the same,

404
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,652
then it means we haven't
changed the timeline.

405
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,722
So, all we have to do is keep
to the legend and we'll be fine.

406
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:40,191
- Mm-hmm.
- So, what do we do next?

407
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:44,228
I've got an idea, but we're going to
need to find more appropriate attire

408
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,731
so we don't stick out
like sore thumbs.

409
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,508
Oh!

410
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:04,115
Funniest thing
I've seen all night.

411
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:15,359
Hear ye! Hear ye!

412
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:20,031
Presenting Sir Norville of
Crystal Covia and his entourage.

413
00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:28,506
Like, I, Sir Norville
of Crystal Cove...

414
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:29,875
Ia!

415
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:34,679
Crystal Covia,
do present myself before thy king.

416
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,481
Crystal Covia? Hmm.

417
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:38,816
Sounds very new-agey.
Very "witchy."

418
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:42,153
Where is it? What do they wear?
Is it clothes?

419
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,056
Uh, Crystal Covia lies
far across the sea.

420
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:49,026
We have great treasures,
like malt shops and Taco Tuesdays.

421
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:50,761
- And...
- Taco Wednesdays.

422
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:52,463
Taco Wednesdays.

423
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,967
And yes, we mostly wear clothes.
But sometimes also food.

424
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,634
They're slobs.

425
00:27:56,701 --> 00:28:01,072
This sounds like witchcraft
to me. Right? Eh? Am I right?

426
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:05,878
Yeah, yeah. All right then.
Show it to me.

427
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:08,412
Let's see it. Bring it on.
Show me the witchcraft.

428
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,281
Your Highness, there is
no such thing as...

429
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:11,850
I know witchcraft.

430
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:16,120
Where I'm from, I was
taught by 1,000 sand-witches.

431
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:19,824
And I'd like to
put you under the spell

432
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:23,628
of a beast from 1,500 years
in your future.

433
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:24,897
The Hoagie!

434
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:27,298
Scooby, let's make history.

435
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:41,345
Now, all we need
is a knife to cut it with.

436
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:43,080
Shaggy.

437
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,050
That'll work perfectly.

438
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,388
I love your knife holder.
Very rustic.

439
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:04,036
And, like, that's what I call
a Super Shaggy Sandwich.

440
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:13,946
Whoa. Hey, I know it's an amazing
sandwich, but come on.

441
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,746
It's just like the legend.

442
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:18,583
You just pulled Excalibur
from the stone.

443
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:21,485
That makes you
the rightful heir to Camelot.

444
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,355
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Whoa there, buster.

445
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:26,223
Pump the horse brakes,
all right?

446
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,561
Pulling an old hunk of metal from
a rock doesn't make one a leader.

447
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:33,497
It literally says,
"Whosoever pulls the sword

448
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,300
from the stone shall be
the rightful king of Camelot."

449
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,537
You come in here with
your sand-witchcraft,

450
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:42,807
steal my sword, and try
to take my throne as well?

451
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:47,111
That, good sir, or madam,
is just plain rude.

452
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:50,481
I ought to give you a taste
of Camelot's just desserts.

453
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:51,816
Hold on, boys.

454
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,019
There has to be
a way we can settle this.

455
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,420
- I'm cool with pie.
- Oh, we will.

456
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,925
We will settle this. Like men!

457
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,425
<i>Hold!</i>

458
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:03,394
Huh?

459
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,068
Who's that?

460
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:12,470
It's me. I'm Merlin.

461
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:13,704
Merlin?

462
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,406
Merlin? Where?

463
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,310
Ah, yes. Me again.

464
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:23,381
I'm Merlin the Magician,
master of knowledge and mystical secrets.

465
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,485
Merlin, you're always spoiling
my fun. Just like my mum.

466
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:30,454
- Beard and all.
- Hmm.

467
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:32,323
If there's one thing
I can't stand,

468
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,792
it's adulty people
acting like children.

469
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:40,899
All this noisy arguing is
what brought me down here.

470
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:44,002
I'm a busy wizard
and I need to focus, right?

471
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,038
Sorry, Mr. Merlin.

472
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:48,539
But our friend Shaggy here pulled the
sword from the stone, so technically...

473
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,744
Yeah. How can there be
two kings at one time?

474
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:57,548
Uh, well, there can't be, can there?
Hmm? You bunch of numpties.

475
00:30:57,615 --> 00:31:00,651
You gotta solve this like
the adulty people you are.

476
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:07,792
With a winner-take-all melee
for the crown!

477
00:31:11,863 --> 00:31:13,397
Hear ye! Hear ye!

478
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:15,100
To determine
the true king,

479
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,569
the prospects must test
their skill upon one another.

480
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:22,273
The champion becoming
the king of Camelot!

481
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:26,711
Like, I'm gonna
have to compete?

482
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:29,948
Because, to be honest,
I'm pretty sure you could take me.

483
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:33,751
We're nobility.

484
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:35,954
Nobility doesn't
fight one another.

485
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:39,690
We get the unwashed commoners
to fight on our behalf.

486
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:41,225
Phew.

487
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:45,362
Us, sweating? Waving our arms around?
Can you imagine?

488
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:46,764
Drumstick?

489
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:48,967
Looks like you boys
have got this sorted.

490
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,335
There's a whole arsenal
down there to choose from.

491
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:54,973
Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal!

492
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:09,286
Right then.
Let's get down to it.

493
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:13,657
I choose, uh, Sir Galahad.

494
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,763
Um, I choose...

495
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,999
Hold on, mate.
I'm not done yet.

496
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:25,636
Sir Percival, Sir Tristan,
Gawain, Sir Kay, Sir Kay, Sir...

497
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:27,738
What if... Could I...
I was... Could I, please...

498
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:29,473
Bedivere,
Sir Kay...

499
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,742
- Sir...
- And I want that pony.

500
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,578
- I'll take...
- Um...

501
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:35,646
- Bors the Younger.
- It would be great...

502
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:36,781
Sir Lamorak...

503
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,482
- I choose...
- And...

504
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:46,657
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

505
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:57,035
Fine. I guess. Sir Lancelot.

506
00:32:57,836 --> 00:32:58,937
Yes!

507
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,909
Like, I'd like a knight
to fight for right,

508
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,310
but there isn't
one in sight.

509
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:10,781
I, Fred of Ascot,

510
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:14,318
do volunteer to fight
on Sir Norville's behalf.

511
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:16,453
Are you sure
you're up for this, Fred?

512
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,989
You're a big tough guy,

513
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:20,758
but those are
crazy-ripped man-men.

514
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:25,964
For sure, Daph.

515
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:28,399
As long as you're there
to cheer me on, we'll be fine.

516
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,803
Besides, the way I figure it,
according to legend, we've already won.

517
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:34,371
What's there
to be afraid of?

518
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:41,512
The Black Plague. Deranged highwaymen.
Giant brown bears.

519
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,748
Dysentery.
Armies of angry orcs...

520
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:53,657
Just the one, eh?

521
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,262
At least your mum thinks
you're cool.

522
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,232
Come on, Velma. Find a way
to get us out of here.

523
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,935
I'm on it. If anyone knows
what's up here, it's Merlin.

524
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:46,744
- Merlin?
- Oh. Hello.

525
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,116
Sorry. I didn't hear you come
in over my burping fire and all.

526
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:59,124
Um, I've come
seeking knowledge.

527
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,929
Oh. You must be my sister Karen's friend.
I can teach you.

528
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:06,998
- Uh...
- Oh, that's fantastic.

529
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,234
You know, Karen's the one
that gave me the idea.

530
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,970
She's like "Can you breathe
fire?" And I'm like "Yes."

531
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:14,005
And then she's like,
"But can you belch the alphabet?"

532
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:16,507
And I'm like,
"Oh, my gosh. Yes, I can."

533
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:20,211
Why has no one ever combined
these two things before?

534
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:25,749
A, B, C, D, E,
F, G.

535
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:28,719
I'm getting stuck on the G.

536
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:33,757
Hey, Merlin, or whoever you want
to call yourself, I'm having a day.

537
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:36,560
That's what
tea's for, my darling.

538
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:43,969
I think you might have
a time machine or something.

539
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:45,569
A device...

540
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:47,305
Okay.
Maybe you call it "magic."

541
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:49,274
Whatever it is,
I need to learn how to use it

542
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:51,876
so I can send my friends
and myself back home.

543
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:55,180
Oh. So you want to be
a sorcerer's assistant, huh?

544
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:59,184
To learn the arcane secrets what
make the world turn like a platter.

545
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,720
Then this is where your quest
for knowledge begins.

546
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:06,958
Uh, what am I supposed
to do with this?

547
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:10,895
When the time comes,
you will know what to do with it.

548
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:14,399
Can't I just have access
to your time machine?

549
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,268
Oh. Is that all you wanted?

550
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:20,804
I call it a "sun dial."

551
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:24,175
Ugh. I'm gonna need magic
just to get through this day.

552
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,714
Well, how do I look?

553
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,584
Like my knight
in shining armor.

554
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,654
Mine, too.

555
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:41,092
Thanks, Scoob.
Well, time to go.

556
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:45,196
Oh, I think not.

557
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:46,697
Morgan!

558
00:36:46,764 --> 00:36:49,800
- Why, I ought to...
- Freeze!

559
00:36:52,437 --> 00:36:54,638
I... I can't move.

560
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,707
Let him go.

561
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:59,044
Don't worry.
It's only temporary.

562
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,080
But long enough
to stop him from competing.

563
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:06,184
Now nothing can stop me from
taking the throne from Arthur.

564
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,126
- What are we gonna do?
- Fred can't joust like this.

565
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:16,660
He'll have to forfeit,

566
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:19,297
and King Arthur will win,
which means we might...

567
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,199
Poof. Disappear.

568
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:25,003
No. We have to give Velma
more time to figure things out.

569
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,407
I've got a plan.
A plan so crazy it might just work.

570
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:33,211
Fred! Fred! Fred!

571
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,048
Uh, where's your knight?

572
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:38,950
Uh, I don't know.

573
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:51,162
Is that
a lady on a horse?

574
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,131
Is that a non-man?

575
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:56,201
No. That's Daphne.
Where's Fred?

576
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,702
Felled by dark magic.
I'm standing in.

577
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:02,207
A non-man
doing sporty man things?

578
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:03,308
That's a laugh, isn't it?

579
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:05,910
Ha! Well, Norville,
after you lose,

580
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:07,846
maybe I can find a job
for you on my staff.

581
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,714
What are your thoughts
on waste removal?

582
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:12,816
I've got a few
ripe buckets of...

583
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:15,453
Actually, King Arthur,
in my land, non-men...

584
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,622
Uh, women can do whatever
they put their minds to.

585
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,492
And some of them
are pretty scary.

586
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:24,255
Smite him, Daph!

587
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,258
Smite that knight
right in the snoot.

588
00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:29,527
Daphne! Daphne!

589
00:39:29,594 --> 00:39:32,430
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!

590
00:39:33,598 --> 00:39:34,933
Daphne, look out!

591
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:46,211
You fight like a girl,
so I'll go easy on you.

592
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,319
Oh, I was just dodging.
Was I supposed to be fighting?

593
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:57,255
Look, little girl, first off,
you're skinny as a...

594
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:05,129
- Stick.
- Don't worry.

595
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:07,098
Those dents will
buff right out.

596
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:09,567
Yes! Yes! Yes!

597
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:14,305
Lancelot just got beat
by a girl!

598
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:16,941
That's a point for you.
But so worth it.

599
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:19,344
- Cheese?
- Cheese.

600
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,311
Mmm.

601
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:24,682
Sir Daphne, you're my
knight in shining armor.

602
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:27,652
Daphne! Daphne!

603
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:48,306
Rah! Huzzah!

604
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:01,919
Yes!

605
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:03,621
Peanuts.
Anybody want peanuts?

606
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:05,822
Gimme two.
I don't carry money.

607
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:22,340
This is it. He's the last
knight on Arthur's side.

608
00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:26,944
I want Daph to win, but, you know,
I also kinda want her to lose.

609
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,513
Go get him, Daph.

610
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,815
Here. For luck.

611
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:36,054
Go get him, Daphne.

612
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:40,091
Oh. I can't look.

613
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:55,573
Oh, no.

614
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,375
- I won!
- You won!

615
00:41:57,442 --> 00:42:00,311
Ugh! This is the worst
thing that's ever happened.

616
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:01,846
At last!

617
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:09,120
Now, with the king chosen, I have
sent an emissary to bring him to me.

618
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:24,502
As I perform this ancient rite,
it will cause a big, terrible fight.

619
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:28,573
As swords clash and clang,
you'll go out with a bang!

620
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:34,145
As you're slain by my wicked Black Knight!

621
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:51,929
Like, what is that?

622
00:42:51,996 --> 00:42:54,031
That is your doom.

623
00:42:54,098 --> 00:42:56,835
Black Knight, attack!

624
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:03,574
Well, that's a bit excessive.

625
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:22,593
Huh?

626
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,066
Finish her!

627
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,002
Not so fast.

628
00:43:35,506 --> 00:43:39,177
Velma, you're back.
And you've learned the wizarding ways.

629
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:41,145
Look. She's got
magic pajamas.

630
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:43,281
Yeah, Merlin gave
me these robes,

631
00:43:43,347 --> 00:43:45,483
but I didn't learn
squat up there.

632
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,985
Magic is nonsense.

633
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:51,857
I'm here to save you the new-fashioned way.
With science.

634
00:43:53,658 --> 00:43:55,293
It's all about physics.

635
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,962
Abra-ka-whatever-
fantasy-nerds-say.

636
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,349
An object in motion stays in motion
with the same speed and direction...

637
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:34,198
...unless acted
upon by an unbalanced force.

638
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:39,737
It's all you, Daph.
Let's unmask our villain.

639
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:41,840
Shaggy, the sword.

640
00:44:41,907 --> 00:44:43,374
The sword?

641
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,446
Daph, catch!

642
00:44:53,852 --> 00:44:56,320
And the Black
Knight is actually...

643
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,128
Gross.

644
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:09,935
Anyone have a spare helmet?
Or, like, a paper bag?

645
00:45:11,602 --> 00:45:14,105
Oh, come on. Come on, come on.
Gimme a break.

646
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:16,207
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

647
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,177
"When apprentices
fail at their quest,

648
00:45:20,244 --> 00:45:21,980
and they just didn't
give it their best.

649
00:45:22,046 --> 00:45:24,983
When there's trouble with
magic, don't let it turn tragic.

650
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:27,385
Just call Merlin.
He's at your behest."

651
00:45:28,954 --> 00:45:30,254
Is all magic limericks?

652
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,698
Ooh. Looks like we've gotten ourselves
into a bit of a barney, haven't we? Hmm?

653
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,768
Heh. Barney.

654
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:45,871
Like Barney Rubble.
It rhymes with trouble.

655
00:45:45,938 --> 00:45:49,574
Wait. How do you know about Barney Rubble?
He's from the future.

656
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,676
He's a caveman.

657
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:57,148
Merlin! Help!

658
00:45:57,214 --> 00:45:58,549
Oh, bother.

659
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:10,494
Whoa!

660
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,263
How do I learn
how to do that?

661
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,598
He says it's magic.

662
00:46:13,664 --> 00:46:15,232
But I'm building a case
that he's actually

663
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:17,635
some sort of super-genius
from the 27th century.

664
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:19,838
Ray guns.
Molecular transportation.

665
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,176
Or, you know...

666
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:26,979
Ah, young apprentice.

667
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:29,714
You must study even harder if
you're to become a proper wizard.

668
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,583
Study what? The stuff in
this book is nonsense.

669
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,752
I just want to
time-travel back home.

670
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:37,055
This is all just bad
limericks and gobbledygook.

671
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:40,859
To a wizard, gobbledygook is
the most important kind of gook.

672
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:45,296
When the time is right, young lad,
you'll know just how to use that book.

673
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:47,032
But, please, Merlin.
I just have to...

674
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,906
Second-hand wizard.
Ought to be illegal.

675
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:56,474
What a show
that guy puts on.

676
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,843
Come on.

677
00:46:57,909 --> 00:46:59,610
We just want to use
your time-travel machine

678
00:46:59,677 --> 00:47:02,279
so we can go home and watch
<i>Thundarr the Barbarian.</i>

679
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:03,714
Ugh! Timeline.

680
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:10,088
Wizard-speak for
"I promise to study harder."

681
00:47:10,154 --> 00:47:11,722
I guess that's that.

682
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,357
I think not!

683
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:16,827
Like, what's happening, man?

684
00:47:18,897 --> 00:47:21,732
Since you are the rightful
king, then you are mine.

685
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:23,768
Farewell, you miscreants.

686
00:47:23,835 --> 00:47:28,205
When next we meet,
it will be your doom!

687
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:33,778
Shaggy!

688
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:40,018
Don't worry, Scoob.
We'll get him back.

689
00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:41,485
We better hurry. Look.

690
00:47:41,552 --> 00:47:43,587
Our future is fading
out of existence.

691
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,590
If we don't find out where Shaggy
went, we'll cease to be,

692
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:49,193
creating a time paradox
that will destroy the world.

693
00:47:50,862 --> 00:47:53,798
Ooh, ooh, ooh. I know this one.
Uh, I know where he went.

694
00:47:53,865 --> 00:47:56,734
To Morgan's Keep.
Not far from here.

695
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,402
Really creepy.

696
00:47:58,469 --> 00:48:00,204
And there's a gauntlet
of deadly traps

697
00:48:00,271 --> 00:48:02,273
before you can even
get inside.

698
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:03,374
Did someone say traps?

699
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:05,376
Deadly traps?

700
00:48:05,443 --> 00:48:09,380
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Deadly traps.
Awesome. Good luck.

701
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:10,815
Hope you get
your mate back.

702
00:48:10,882 --> 00:48:12,349
He's your friend, too.

703
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:17,321
I don't need a mate.
I'm a king. I have hoagies.

704
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:19,557
Uh, hoagies!

705
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,262
How can you eat
at a time like this?

706
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:29,868
Yeah. Even Scooby knows that when a friend's
in trouble, you drop everything for them.

707
00:48:29,935 --> 00:48:31,002
Even snacks.

708
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:35,239
I told you. Shaggy's not my...

709
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,695
Shaggy is my mate.

710
00:48:57,762 --> 00:49:00,531
Or the closest I've got to one.

711
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,203
My whole life is a lie.

712
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:07,438
So you'll join the Scooby
Gang while we rescue him?

713
00:49:07,505 --> 00:49:11,776
No. Are you mad? I'm not leaving this
castle without a bunch of knights.

714
00:49:11,843 --> 00:49:14,146
Oh, no. I think
I broke them all.

715
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:17,182
Hmm.

716
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,282
I've got it.

717
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:20,451
Um, kneel.

718
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:26,958
I, Arthur Pendragon,
King of Camelot,

719
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:30,494
and the rightful
wielder of Excalibur,

720
00:49:30,561 --> 00:49:34,565
do dub thee Knights
of the Round Table.

721
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:43,008
Let's go and save our mate.

722
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:48,213
I love your hair!

723
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:33,959
So, this is it?
Huh. That's strange.

724
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:35,593
What, Velma?

725
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:38,163
Oh, nothing. I just could have
sworn we've been here before.

726
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,766
Oh, you would remember if you had.
Welcome to Morgan's Keep.

727
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:45,871
This cave leads down
into the bowels of the Earth,

728
00:50:45,937 --> 00:50:49,140
where Morgan Le Fey
practices her dark magic.

729
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:51,542
Don't be scared, Scooby.

730
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:53,777
Remember, we're here
to save Shaggy.

731
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:57,448
Say, Arthur, how are we going
to get across that moat?

732
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:01,752
Well,
that's not creepy.

733
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:08,360
There. Down that corridor.

734
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:09,961
What are we waiting for?

735
00:51:10,661 --> 00:51:11,863
Whoa!

736
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,535
Oh, it's the gauntlet
of deadly traps.

737
00:51:18,602 --> 00:51:20,471
Oh, right. I forgot.

738
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:23,774
Velma, can you get us across with
your powers as a student wizard?

739
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:24,976
I can try.

740
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:28,179
So silly.

741
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:33,584
"I call on the powers of fable to
make passage for knights of the table.

742
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:36,487
For this evil hallway
will attempt to fillet,

743
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:39,423
cook or smash us
as long as it's able."

744
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,860
- Did it work?
- I don't know.

745
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:46,797
I guess not.

746
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:48,699
Well, we gave
it a good go.

747
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:51,435
If we head back now, we'll be just
in time for tea and jellied eels.

748
00:51:51,502 --> 00:51:52,736
We can't leave.

749
00:51:52,803 --> 00:51:54,839
Then what are
we gonna do?

750
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:58,542
You're the master of traps, Fred.
You can figure this out.

751
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:26,737
Am I a wizard?
No. Am I an artist?

752
00:52:29,473 --> 00:52:31,376
I, uh, hadn't really
thought about it.

753
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:33,044
Sorry. What does
this do again?

754
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:36,513
I used the bow we brought
with us to make a trebuchet

755
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,285
that will throw a stone through
the hallway, pulling the sled,

756
00:52:40,352 --> 00:52:43,721
which will slide us past the traps
before they're able to do anything.

757
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:46,324
It's an antitrap trap.

758
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:48,659
Brilliant. We're all gonna die.

759
00:52:48,726 --> 00:52:50,962
- Ready, gang?
- Ready!

760
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:45,450
Well, and Bob's your uncle.
We made it.

761
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,253
Sir Fred, you are
a regular anorak.

762
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,257
Actually, I think I'm half-Dutch
or Norway-ese or something.

763
00:53:57,128 --> 00:54:00,065
Huh?

764
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:12,810
I knew you could do it.

765
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:15,579
Thanks, guys, but come on.
We've gotta save Shaggy.

766
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:21,953
Huh?

767
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,239
Sorry. What's that
horrible noise?

768
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:44,309
- More deadly traps?
- It's Shaggy.

769
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:56,254
Scooby-Doo. It's great
to see you, pal.

770
00:54:56,321 --> 00:55:00,391
- Shaggy, are you all right?
- I am now that you're here.

771
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:02,793
Hors d'oeuvres?

772
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:04,596
Come on. We gotta
get out of here.

773
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:08,900
He has a point. Waste not, want not.
That's what I always say.

774
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,035
Stand back.

775
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:23,780
Oh.

776
00:55:52,776 --> 00:55:56,481
- Now can we go?
- Yep. Food's gone.

777
00:55:57,649 --> 00:55:58,883
It's too late.

778
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,052
The picture. It's gone.

779
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,754
Whatever we did,
we just made the timeline worse.

780
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,857
Now the phone
isn't even working,

781
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:08,759
as if the technology
itself was disappearing.

782
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:09,994
We've failed.

783
00:56:10,061 --> 00:56:11,963
Right, you are!

784
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,272
Ha! Finally!

785
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:23,575
Now with Excalibur
in my hand

786
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:26,810
and Sir Norville having granted
me the deed to the throne...

787
00:56:26,878 --> 00:56:28,179
Deed to the throne?

788
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:30,448
Yes. For as much food
as he could eat.

789
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:33,551
It's all here.
Legal and everything.

790
00:56:33,618 --> 00:56:35,253
Shaggy, you didn't?

791
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,222
Why would I want
a seat on the throne

792
00:56:37,288 --> 00:56:39,357
when I've got some tea and a scone?

793
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:42,093
Now, with this deed
and the sword,

794
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,865
I am the rightful ruler
of all of Camelot.

795
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:51,735
Huh?

796
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:54,672
Only if you can
hold onto it.

797
00:56:54,738 --> 00:56:58,176
You think you can
defeat me?

798
00:56:58,243 --> 00:57:01,346
I am the greatest
sorceress of all time,

799
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:04,916
but this battle
is going to drag on.

800
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:07,452
Drag on. Get it?

801
00:57:07,518 --> 00:57:09,220
This is my dumb little joke,

802
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:12,290
since you all seem to like
making dumb little jokes so much.

803
00:57:15,326 --> 00:57:17,929
Uh-oh.
I don't like this pun.

804
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:24,235
Dragon!

805
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,738
Uh-oh. Oh.
That's not good.

806
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:29,474
Oh! Oh!

807
00:57:38,883 --> 00:57:45,023
I am Morgan Le Fey, ruler of
Camelot, and I am hungry.

808
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:52,864
Guys, this table
is built really well,

809
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,899
but I don't think
it can take another blast.

810
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:02,307
We're gonna need some real
magic to get us out of this one.

811
00:58:02,373 --> 00:58:04,142
Have you gotten
good yet, Velma?

812
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:07,145
No. But I know one word that
always works for this gang.

813
00:58:11,649 --> 00:58:15,586
- What's that?
- Run! Follow me!

814
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:20,391
Like, if you can't take the heat,
get out of the dragon's lair.

815
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:40,511
You cannot escape me!

816
00:59:57,922 --> 01:00:01,192
Come on, King Arthur.
Put the dragons right behind us.

817
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:03,995
Go, Shaggy.

818
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:06,564
I can't hold this door forever.

819
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:08,666
Jump, Shaggy!

820
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,541
Demon dogs, Shaggy. Go!

821
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:29,654
King Arthur.

822
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,489
I'm sure he's fine.

823
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:51,709
You thought you could
escape me, you fools.

824
01:00:51,776 --> 01:00:56,882
If you have any last words,
the time has come to use them.

825
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:59,550
<i>When the time
is right, young lad,</i>

826
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:02,453
<i>you'll know just
how to use that book.</i>

827
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:51,435
Thank you. Because of you,
we can wake up to a brighter tomorrow.

828
01:01:51,502 --> 01:01:55,740
Tomorrow? Velma, the picture.
Has it come back?

829
01:01:57,742 --> 01:01:59,310
- Nope.
- Oh, no.

830
01:01:59,377 --> 01:02:01,312
You mean we've destroyed
the future?

831
01:02:01,379 --> 01:02:04,850
No more video games?
No more double cheeseburgers?

832
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:07,019
No more Scooby Snacks?

833
01:02:10,254 --> 01:02:12,991
And no way to return home.

834
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:14,525
Don't worry, Sir Fred.

835
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:17,061
You can join me and
my Knights of the Round Table.

836
01:02:17,128 --> 01:02:18,496
All of you can.

837
01:02:18,563 --> 01:02:22,066
Together, we can make
the world a better place.

838
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:24,569
Create a kingdom
where everyone is welcome

839
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:27,405
as long as they fight
on the side of right.

840
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:31,877
Together, we can make Camelot
a beacon on the hill,

841
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:35,580
shining a light into
the darkest of places.

842
01:02:36,213 --> 01:02:38,884
Bravo. Bravo.

843
01:02:38,951 --> 01:02:40,585
Velma, what are you doing?

844
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:43,688
Oh, just applauding
these fine performers.

845
01:02:43,754 --> 01:02:47,124
I guess that's the end of your
little show then, isn't it?

846
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:58,502
Mrs. Wentworth?

847
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:00,671
Is she trapped
back in time, too?

848
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:04,910
No, Shaggy. She's not back in
time, and neither are we.

849
01:03:04,977 --> 01:03:06,677
But the photo on the phone.

850
01:03:06,744 --> 01:03:09,081
Forgot to charge it.
It just went dead.

851
01:03:09,146 --> 01:03:11,582
But all the magic.
The flying, the lights...

852
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:13,885
Heck, when she did
that spell to freeze me.

853
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:16,554
It's like I thought.
There was no magic.

854
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:18,823
<i>It was all just
wires, sleep gas,</i>

855
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:22,226
<i>and the light show that the mayor said
the town was going to show us later on.</i>

856
01:03:22,293 --> 01:03:24,295
As for the freezing,

857
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:27,365
we all know you're kind of impressionable
when someone yells in your direction.

858
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:29,868
- What? That's not...
- Jump!

859
01:03:30,836 --> 01:03:32,536
Okay. Good to know.

860
01:03:34,472 --> 01:03:37,976
So, the people,
they were what? Actors?

861
01:03:38,043 --> 01:03:39,610
Not just any actors.

862
01:03:39,677 --> 01:03:43,180
This in none other than that
wonderful British thespian,

863
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:44,715
Winston Pilkingstonshire.

864
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:47,119
Winston Pilkingstonshire?

865
01:03:47,184 --> 01:03:51,155
He's the actor who plays
Thundarr the Barbarian on TV.

866
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:52,790
- Right?
- Right.

867
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:55,660
I got even more suspicious
when Arthur said "demon dogs,"

868
01:03:55,726 --> 01:03:57,762
one of Thundarr's
catchphrases.

869
01:03:57,828 --> 01:04:01,632
You know, you say the same lines
for 30 years, they're hard to shake.

870
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:04,002
But what really gave it away
were the abs.

871
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:06,303
I'd know those abs anywhere.

872
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:08,172
Whoa. Will you sign my tunic?

873
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,410
Yes, it's me and my abs.

874
01:04:12,476 --> 01:04:17,248
But we couldn't have done it without this
marvelous medieval Renaissance troupe.

875
01:04:17,314 --> 01:04:20,418
Everyone, please,
take a bow.

876
01:04:22,054 --> 01:04:24,488
Velma, amazing deduction.

877
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:26,590
It's true. I was hired to be
the inaugural actor

878
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:31,429
to play King Arthur in Norville o'er
Morgania's newest tourist attraction,

879
01:04:31,495 --> 01:04:33,664
Camelot Reimagined.

880
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:38,402
Camelot Reimagined?
What is that?

881
01:04:38,469 --> 01:04:40,438
It should be obvious, Daphne.

882
01:04:40,504 --> 01:04:43,207
<i>Do you remember when we first
arrived at Norville o'er Morgania?</i>

883
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:47,344
<i>We reached that roundabout with the
one road blocked off for construction.</i>

884
01:04:47,411 --> 01:04:50,448
This must be some sort of
immersive attraction

885
01:04:50,514 --> 01:04:52,884
built right next to the town
to attract tourists.

886
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:56,054
In fact, with the way that Camelot
is centered in this small valley

887
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:58,957
to obscure what's on the other
side of that stand of trees

888
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:02,493
and how the castle only has
windows facing one side,

889
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,229
I'm willing to bet that
Norville o'er Morgania

890
01:05:05,296 --> 01:05:07,331
is actually only
a couple of miles away.

891
01:05:07,398 --> 01:05:12,403
She's right. And you five are
our first guests to take part

892
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:16,141
in what we hope will be a very
lucrative entertainment experience.

893
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:19,677
Yeah, but did they have to knock
us out to pretend it was real?

894
01:05:19,744 --> 01:05:21,980
Actually, they did, Shaggy.

895
01:05:22,047 --> 01:05:23,982
- All because of you.
- Me?

896
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,484
Do you remember
the legend of Sir Norville?

897
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,353
It said that if Norville
or any of his line returned,

898
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,722
they would lay claim
to the land of Camelot.

899
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:33,992
When the mayor
found out about your lineage

900
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,627
<i>and saw your ancient medallion
with the inscription of Camelot,</i>

901
01:05:36,694 --> 01:05:39,730
<i>he was convinced you were
here to lay claim to the town.</i>

902
01:05:39,797 --> 01:05:42,000
<i>Precisely. After he met Shaggy,</i>

903
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,702
<i>he organized a town meeting
and told everyone</i>

904
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:46,838
<i>they would have to do
whatever it takes</i>

905
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:49,707
<i>to get you to sign over the
deed for the land to the town.</i>

906
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:52,144
Like, I don't wanna
own real estate.

907
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,980
- You don't?
- Ma'am, no way.

908
01:05:55,046 --> 01:05:57,581
Do you know how many
creepy, evil people we've met

909
01:05:57,648 --> 01:06:00,018
that do weird things
just for a piece of land?

910
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:04,256
No offense,
but I'd gladly sign over the deed.

911
01:06:04,321 --> 01:06:06,024
Just give me the paperwork.

912
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,959
That's very sweet, Shaggy.

913
01:06:08,026 --> 01:06:12,030
Luckily, you've already
signed the deed... over to me!

914
01:06:14,065 --> 01:06:15,699
Ha-ha!

915
01:06:15,766 --> 01:06:19,670
Um, this is definitely not
part of the script.

916
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:22,673
I know because I memorized the
entire thing, everyone's parts.

917
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,742
I always do.
It's just a thing.

918
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:28,646
These ignorant townspeople put everything
into this King Arthur experience,

919
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:31,249
wanting to split the profits
between everyone.

920
01:06:31,315 --> 01:06:35,187
But you know what's better than splitting
profits with hundreds of people?

921
01:06:35,253 --> 01:06:37,388
Splitting them with no one!

922
01:06:37,454 --> 01:06:39,824
Once I send this to
the proper authorities,

923
01:06:39,891 --> 01:06:43,261
this town and the money
it makes will be mine!

924
01:06:45,396 --> 01:06:47,698
She's trying to get away.
Get her!

925
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,568
Look out!

926
01:06:58,475 --> 01:07:00,411
And there goes my retirement.

927
01:07:00,477 --> 01:07:03,380
All she has to do is mail that
deed and the town is hers.

928
01:07:03,447 --> 01:07:04,782
We have to stop her.

929
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,584
Where's the nearest mailbox?

930
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,287
Uh, what's a mailbox, Sir Fred?

931
01:07:09,353 --> 01:07:11,256
We're not acting anymore,
you twit.

932
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:13,724
Oh, right, mate.
Sorry, sorry.

933
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,459
It's about two kilometers
that way

934
01:07:15,526 --> 01:07:17,628
in the center
of Norville o'er Morgania.

935
01:07:17,695 --> 01:07:21,498
But she's too far away.
There's no way we can catch up to her.

936
01:07:21,565 --> 01:07:23,134
No, there is a way.

937
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:33,078
Ariel, Ookla, ride!

938
01:07:38,415 --> 01:07:39,851
Do you wanna?

939
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:41,485
No. You be Ariel.

940
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:43,721
I'm Ookla, naturally.

941
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:03,474
Those fools. With this deed,
there's nothing to stop me

942
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:06,777
from owning this town
once and for all.

943
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:07,778
Huh?

944
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:14,752
This is your idea?

945
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:17,122
Don't worry, love.
It's just a converted lorry.

946
01:08:17,188 --> 01:08:18,789
A baby could drive it.

947
01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:23,494
See? What did
I tell you? Easy-peasy.

948
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,430
Like,
this is amazing!

949
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,313
She's getting away!

950
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:42,446
Huh?

951
01:09:05,736 --> 01:09:07,571
We've gotta put her down.

952
01:09:07,638 --> 01:09:09,473
All right. Winston's got it.

953
01:09:20,684 --> 01:09:22,053
Hold on, everyone.

954
01:09:30,694 --> 01:09:33,664
Lords of Light, that was fun!

955
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:36,034
- Oh, let's go again.
- Ariel rules!

956
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:39,037
We made it.
We, like, survived.

957
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:46,244
But you failed in your quest!

958
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:51,249
Not yet we haven't,
vile sorceress.

959
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:56,587
Fly true, my beauty!

960
01:09:59,924 --> 01:10:01,960
And for good measure...

961
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,870
What? No fair!

962
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:15,572
Oh, my.
What's going on here?

963
01:10:15,639 --> 01:10:19,576
Well, Mayor, we know about you and the
town trying to gaslight us into thinking

964
01:10:19,643 --> 01:10:21,046
we were trapped
in the Dark Ages

965
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:23,381
in order to claim this land
as your own.

966
01:10:23,448 --> 01:10:26,151
But, then, you didn't think
your town librarian

967
01:10:26,217 --> 01:10:28,652
would try to steal
the deed for herself.

968
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,554
I would've gotten
away with it, too,

969
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:33,058
if it wasn't for you
meddling kids.

970
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:34,825
And... And...

971
01:10:34,893 --> 01:10:37,694
A little bit of
Scooby Gang magic.

972
01:10:39,397 --> 01:10:43,301
Well, I'm assuming that you'll
want to lay claim to the land then.

973
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,836
No way.

974
01:10:44,903 --> 01:10:47,872
This land belongs to you
and the rest of the town.

975
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:50,275
I'm actually pretty proud
to know my ancestors

976
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:53,311
came from such imaginative
and entrepreneurial people.

977
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,779
Well, then there's only
one thing left to do.

978
01:10:55,847 --> 01:10:57,581
What's that, Mayor?

979
01:10:57,648 --> 01:10:59,284
Party!

980
01:11:03,922 --> 01:11:07,959
Not a bad way to spend our vacation.
Wouldn't you say so, Sir Fred?

981
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:11,062
Not bad at all,
Sir Daphne.

982
01:11:11,129 --> 01:11:14,199
So, was any of it real,
Mr. Pilkingstonshire?

983
01:11:14,265 --> 01:11:17,135
Our budding bromance?
The sandwiches?

984
01:11:17,202 --> 01:11:19,104
- Any of it?
- I'm an actor, Shaggy,

985
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:22,340
but there are some things
you just can't fake.

986
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:25,676
One of those things
is a love of sandwiches.

987
01:11:25,742 --> 01:11:29,080
Watch the sandwich scene in <i>Citizen Kane.</i>
You'll see what I mean.

988
01:11:30,849 --> 01:11:32,984
Friendship is another one,
Shaggy.

989
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:35,286
You kids aren't so bad,
for septics.

990
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:38,857
Uh, septic tanks. Yanks.

991
01:11:38,923 --> 01:11:41,326
I've got a wonderful
beach house in the UK.

992
01:11:41,392 --> 01:11:42,927
You must come sometime.

993
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:45,196
And stay in a hotel
nearby.

994
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:47,298
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

995
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:49,901
I'm still not sure
how you pulled it off.

996
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:52,937
The blasts of cold air,
fireballs, flying...

997
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:54,738
It all felt so real.

998
01:11:54,805 --> 01:11:57,041
Magic is real, Velma.

999
01:11:57,108 --> 01:12:01,179
You just have to look
deep within to find it.

1000
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:05,850
Okay, I get it. A magician never
tells how he did the trick.

1001
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:08,153
Now, young apprentice,
I gotta run.

1002
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:10,054
Remember the lessons
I've taught you, hmm?

1003
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:13,591
Once you suss out magic,
there's nothing you can't get up to.

1004
01:12:13,657 --> 01:12:16,194
Sure. Thank you, "Merlin."

1005
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:18,029
It's been surreal.

1006
01:12:19,663 --> 01:12:21,833
Tatty-bye.

1007
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,736
Where is your friend going?
He's going to miss the fireworks show.

1008
01:12:25,802 --> 01:12:27,771
My friend?
You mean Merlin?

1009
01:12:27,839 --> 01:12:29,706
Isn't he
one of the townspeople?

1010
01:12:29,773 --> 01:12:32,310
No. Never seen him
before in my life.

1011
01:12:32,377 --> 01:12:35,113
- We thought he was with you.
- He's not with me.

1012
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,681
And if he's not
with you, then...

1013
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:40,251
No. It can't be.

1014
01:12:47,824 --> 01:12:50,028
Told you reality
was a simulation.

1015
01:12:50,094 --> 01:12:54,866
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
