00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:25,217
Do you like my toupee,
Barbarian?

4
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:26,483
Demon dogs!

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,519
He's taken a piece of
Ookla's mane

6
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:30,588
and used it
to cover his bald spot.

7
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:33,390
Why can't cat people
just grow old gracefully?

[dramatic music playing]

16
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,631
There's a creature on the wing!
It's attacking the aluminum.

17
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,234
Shaggy!

18
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:18,203
[grunts] I've got you, Scoob!

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,205
[whimpering]

20
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:21,239

[all screaming]

22
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:28,179
Like, whatever you do,
don't look behind you.

23
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:30,081
Behind me?

24
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:31,917
No! Don't look behind you.

25
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,488
Well, like,
don't look down either.

26
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:39,723
That's cowardice 101, Scoob.

27
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,397
[whimpering]

28

[growls]

29
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,003
[Shaggy] Now, Scoob!

30
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,938
[exclaims in surprise]

31
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:55,874
[creature screaming]

32
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,710
[Daphne] It worked!

33
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:01,980
Come on, Velma.
Let's reel him in.

34
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,882
[both straining]

35
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:07,685
[Fred] Yeah!

36
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:10,521
[all whimpering]

37
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:18,762
Wow. A real-life monster
here in my hangar.

38
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,564
I can't believe
you kids caught it.

39
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:22,666
Not an "it," Mr. HB.

40
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,604
[Mr. HB] Herman Ellinger.

41
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:31,709
That's the rude passenger
from B17. But why?

42
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:34,879
Why? Because airline tickets
cost an arm and a leg.

43
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,349
I knew if I could scare
your passengers away

44
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:38,984
you'd have to lower
your prices,

45
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,585
and I could fly almost anywhere
for practically nothing.

46
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,923
Yeah! Airline prices
are the real monster.

47
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,790
I don't think
you get discounts for...

48
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,625
And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

49
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:51,396
if it wasn't for you meddling
kids and that mangy mutt of yours.

50
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,696
Hey!

51
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:54,765
[slurps]

52
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,700
[giggles]

53
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,973
I can't thank you kids enough.

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,541
But I still don't know
how you figured it out.

55
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:06,378
Easy. With science.

56
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:09,314
After the first sighting
of the monster, I had an idea.

57
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:12,150
I collected scraps from leftover
food served on the airplane

58
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,152
and cross referenced
the DNA samples

59
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,687
against the piece of hair
we found on the plane's wing.

60
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:18,323
Incredible.

61
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,993
DNA? Gee, that doesn't sound
like mystery-solving at all.

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,829
The only mystery is why anyone
would try to solve anything

63
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,865
without good old science
to back them up.

64
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:29,600
Say, uh,
there's two other papers here.

65
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,635
Oh, that's because
there were two extra people

66
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:36,007
that ate the food on the plane,
despite us asking them not to.

67
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,177
[both chomping]

68
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:42,380
Uh-oh. What'd we do?

69
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:45,783
It looks like the lab ran your
DNA test along with Ellinger's.

70
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,453
Are you guys curious
where your ancestors came from?

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Huh? Denmark?

72
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,526
Well, you are a Great Dane
after all.

73
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:58,229
Emphasis on the "great."
[giggling]

74
00:03:58,296 --> 00:03:59,630
What about you, Shaggy?

75
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,900
It says my ancestors
come from a small village

76
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:05,736
in the north of England called
Norville o'er Morgania.

77
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:07,939
- Huh? What a weird name.
- Hmm.

78
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:10,041
It says here
that Norville o'er Morgania

79
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:14,345
is known to be one of the suspected
locations of the ancient city of Camelot.

80
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:19,217
Also, it says that it has the best fish
and chips in all of the United Kingdom.

81
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:21,119
- Fish?
- And chips?

82
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:22,087
[slurps]

83
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:24,688
[both drooling]

84
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:27,425
Those were fries,
but I'm still on board.

85
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,060
I wish we could go, gang.

86
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,728
But we didn't go into
mystery solving for the money.

87
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:33,998
Well, Daphne was right
on one account.

88
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,101
Airline prices
are the real monster.

89
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,735
Well, it's lucky
I have an airline then.

90
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:40,637
What do you mean, Mr. HB?

91
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:42,140
[chuckles]
What do I mean?

92
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,843
You just saved my whole airline
from bankruptcy.

93
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:49,147
I'll fly you and your friends
anywhere you wanna go, free of charge.

94
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,182
It's the least I can do.

95
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,785
Well, gang, I guess we're
headed to jolly old England.

96
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:57,322
[all cheering]

97
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:01,259
[theme music playing]

98
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,889
[Fred] That sure
was nice of Mr. HB

99
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,558
to ship over
the Mystery Machine.

100
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,459
It sure was.

101
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:10,929
Say, Fred, the map says you were
supposed to make a left back there.

102
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:15,066
Map? [chuckles] Oh, Daphne,
Jones men don't need maps.

103
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,635
We were born with
an innate sense of direction.

104
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,938
We were made
for the open road.

105
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,606
- [gasps] Fred!
- [horn blaring]

106
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,474
[all screaming]

107
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,777
[tires screeching]

108
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,812
Fred, you do know
that they drive

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,349
on the left side of the road
in England, right?

110
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,284
Boy. They built
the roads wrong...

111
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,120
Is this the one where the toilet
water goes the wrong way, too?

112
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:42,961
Say, look at that.

113
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:48,366
See? I told you
I knew where we were going.

114
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,670
[Daphne] Fred!

115
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:54,372
[Fred] I got it.
Just testing you.

116
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,884
[Fred] Wow. It looks like
they're about to have a party.

117
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,720
[chuckles] Good timing.

118
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:09,820
Party?

119
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,522
Oh, man. That means...

120
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,225
[both] Party food!

121
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,729
[Shaggy] "Fish and chips.
Bangers and mash. Toad in the hole."

122
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,197
[giggles]

123
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:22,233
"Welsh rarebit. Spotted dick.
Jam roly-poly."

124
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,935
Are these real?

125
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:27,839
I guess. "Bubble and squeak.
Jellied eels. Angels on horseback."

126
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,274
[mimics explosion sound]

127
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,808
[Shaggy] It's like
a whole new world of food.

128
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,650
Like, Scoob and I
are gonna go grab a snack.

129
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:40,351
We'll be right back.

130
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,254
This place is kind of a dump, gang.
Like, run-down.

131
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,990
Some of the architecture is
left over from medieval times.

132
00:07:46,057 --> 00:07:51,729
Dudes, the place we're staying is all that
remains standing of the Kingdom of Camelot.

133
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:53,531
Camelot? Like King Arthur?

134
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,068
Merlin? Knights of the Round Table?
We're standing on history.

135
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,903
Weren't you just calling
this place a dump?

136
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,639
Yeah, but now it's a dump
where knights lived.

137
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:05,643
There's very little evidence that
Camelot or King Arthur even existed.

138
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,211
[Mr. Saunders] Oh, but he did.

139
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,647
That's what we're celebrating.

140
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:14,018
Hi. I'm Mr. Saunders,
the mayor of this fine city,

141
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:17,088
and this here is my assistant,
Sandi.

142
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:19,123
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

143
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm Daphne, and these are my
friends, Velma and Fred.

144
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:25,263
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

145
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,800
You seemed awfully sure that
King Arthur really existed.

146
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,034
How can you be certain?

147
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,570
Because of our name, of course.

148
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,907
Norville o'er Morgania.

149
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,212
You don't know the story?
Well, not many do.

150
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,115
But never fear.
Soon, everyone will.

151
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:49,320
It all began a long time ago,
right here, on the site of Camelot.

152
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,122
That's right.
The good King Arthur

153
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,858
came under attack by
the villainous Morgan Le Fey.

154
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:58,763
Everything seemed bleak until a
brave knight appeared. Sir Norville.

155
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,431
Known for his fearlessness,

156
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,534
this knight fought the evil
witch and saved Camelot.

157
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:06,170
Witches? Wizards? Come on.

158
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,172
Those stories
came out of the Dark Ages,

159
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,241
where nothing
could be accounted for.

160
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:13,678
A disbeliever. That's okay.

161
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:15,380
Stay in this town
a little while

162
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:18,983
and you'll experience
the magic yourselves.

163
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,985
The Mayor
has worked really hard

164
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,054
to make this
the greatest celebration ever.

165
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:25,590
We have horse races,
archery demonstrations,

166
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:29,193
an unbelievable light show
and even a pie-eating contest.

167
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,530
Did someone say pie eating?
[chuckles]

168
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:34,499
And who is this?

169
00:09:34,565 --> 00:09:38,002
My name's Shaggy,
and this is my pal, Scooby-Doo.

170
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,104
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

171
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:42,073
[Velma] Shaggy's actually
the reason we're here.

172
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,210
It turns out that Shaggy's ancestors
are from Norville o'er Morgania.

173
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:48,079
Norville is a Shaggy name.

174
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:51,349
Yeah. My name's Norville.
Surname Rogers.

175
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,919
But, uh, nobody calls me "Sir."
That's my dad's name.

176
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:57,121
Oh, really? You're sure?

177
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:00,191
He's been a Norville his whole
life, and the DNA test proves it.

178
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:02,026
Norville's a name
that's been handed down

179
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,762
in our family, like...
Like, forever.

180
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,866
[chuckles]
Just like this medallion.

181
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:09,700
My mom gave it to me for luck.

182
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,103
[bell tolling]

183
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,973
Luck, indeed.

184
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,642
We thought we'd look around.

185
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,411
Who knows? Maybe Shaggy's
ancestors left him something.

186
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:23,147
I'm hoping for some sort of
medieval pizza.

187
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,416
Or jellied eels. [slurps]

188
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:28,386
Yes. Well, we have to be going.

189
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:33,591
- It can't be.
- [Mr. Saunders] Sandi.

190
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:36,160
[whispering] You'll never guess
what just happened...

191
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,362
[mysterious music plays]

192
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,566
[whispering]
Did you hear...

193
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:46,671
- That was strange.
- Small towns are weird.

194
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:48,773
Remember that time
you dyed your hair blond

195
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,175
and everyone in that little
northeastern town was talking about it?

196
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:55,012
Oh, yeah. Being blond was
definitely not more fun that day.

197
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,582
And then they all turned into
fish people and tried to eat us.

198
00:10:57,648 --> 00:10:59,484
That's less of
a "small town thing"

199
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,954
than it is
a "Scooby Gang thing."

200
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,088
Come on.
The library is this way.

201
00:11:04,155 --> 00:11:05,790
How do you know?

202
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,459
The same way Scooby and Shaggy
always know where the food is.

203
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,902
[Shaggy]
I don't know, Scooby-Doo.

204
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,839
Are you getting that same sort
of haunted vibe as I am?

205
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:22,240
Uh-huh.

206
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,976
Doesn't everything give you
the haunted vibe?

207
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,143
It's called
managing expectations.

208
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,246
[Velma] Don't worry, guys.

209
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:31,884
The only thing scary about this library
is it still uses the Dewey Decimal System.

210
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,619
Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

211
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:36,220
[scoffs] Unbelievable.

212
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:37,956
Next thing
you're gonna tell me,

213
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:40,424
they put the horror and
romance section side by side.

214
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:41,792
[gasps]

215
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,395
[clears throat]

216
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,933
Hi. I was wondering...

217
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,034
Shh! This is a place of study.

218
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,004
Use your library voice, please.

219
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,071
Of course. I'm sorry.

220
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,711
Is it just me
or is this place dead?

221
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:01,847
Shh!

222
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:03,648
We were visiting and wondered

223
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:05,650
if you can point us to the books
on the history of your town.

224
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:09,487
[sighs] Near the back,
past the horror and romance section.

225
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,556
Next to the horror
and romance section?

226
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:15,326
Sure. Because those genres
are so similar.

227
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:17,029
Exactly.

228
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:19,965
But you'll need to hurry. We're closing
in 20 minutes for the big party.

229
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,668
Why we should be celebrating such a
preposterous story, I'll never know,

230
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,203
but one must do
what one must do.

231
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,740
Okay. We'll be quick.
Thank you.

232

Ooh. You can never know enough
about a subject you love.

235
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:56,467
Here it is. History of Sir
Norville and Morgan Le Fey.

Huh? [shuddering]
That can't be good.

239
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:12,249
It never is.

240
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:14,785
This seems to be
some kind of storybook.

241
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,387
Hmm.

[yawns] tired?

313
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:26,037
- [Velma yawns]
- [yawns] Tired? Oh, yeah.

314
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:29,573
[cackling]

315
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,675
[all moaning]

316
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:38,649
[all yawning]

[dramatic music plays]

00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,829
[Morgan cackling]

[Morgan cackling]

[thunder rumbles]

321
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,422
Shaggy, where are we?

322
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:21,159
Like, I don't know, man.

323
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,261
Shaggy, Scooby, grab my hand.

324
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:24,695
[grunts weakly]

325
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,399
[all exclaiming]

326
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:30,335
[mimicking airplane sound]

327
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,171
We appear to be falling at the
standard 9.8 meters per second

328
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,907
as dictated by the Earth's
gravity, but where's the ground?

329
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:38,243
Skydiving's not a party, man.

330
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,177
I found the ground!

331
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,080
[all screaming]

332
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:43,480
Brace for impact!

333
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:46,217
[both] Huh?

334
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:48,819
Did we make it in one piece?

335
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:52,523
[grunting]
I can't feel my legs.

336
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,563
Like, I can feel my legs,
but I can't feel my fingers feeling them.

337
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,499
[both whimpering]

338
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,902
[Daphne giggles]

339
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:07,238
Where are we?

340
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,107
[groans]

341
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:16,081
No bars. We should've gotten
the international plan.

342
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:20,818
Did I leave my curling iron on
in 1,600 years?

343
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:23,188
Morgan Le Fey
cast a spell on us.

344
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,956
Oh, come on.

345
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:28,226
I'm sure that was just some
kids playing some kind of prank.

346
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,995
Velma, look around.

347
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,730
You're telling me that there's
no way time travel could happen?

348
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,968
[Velma] Well, I mean, wormholes,
black holes, Tipler cylinders.

349
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:39,471
But these are cosmic-level
events we're talking about.

350
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:43,975
So, like not fantasy, but science fiction?
Like Thundarr?

351
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,379
No. Thundarr's more
dumb fantasy than sci-fi.

352
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,947
But you like Thundarr.

353
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:52,083
I like Thundarr's abs, okay?
I watch it for the abs.

354
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,485
Me too.

355
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,353
So, wait. We time-traveled?

356
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,423
Welp, gang, it looks like we
have another mystery on our...

357
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,591
No. Not a mystery.
It's a hoax.

358
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,893
Then how did we time-travel?

359
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,627
We did not time-travel.

360
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:05,864
This is a prank,
or a Japanese game show.

361
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,699
We all just need to chill
and take a deep breath...

362
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,667
[all breathing deeply]

363
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:12,337
...and hold our horses.

364
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:14,105
- [horse whinnies]
- [exclaims]

365

[all laughing]

366
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,342
- Hmm.
- [Scooby-Doo and Shaggy laugh]

367
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:19,411
You gotta admit,
Velma's usually right about this stuff.

368
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:23,915
Let's all just wait here
a bit and see what... Gang.

369
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:26,351
Gang. Gang. Gang. Gang.

370
00:20:26,418 --> 00:20:27,718
Gang.

371
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,121
- [Shaggy and Daphne gasp]
- It's real.

372
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:38,863
[Shaggy and Scooby-Doo gasp]

373
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,568
[jaunty music playing]

374
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:59,017
This can't be real.
It doesn't make sense.

375
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,219
This shouldn't be possible.

376
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:04,255
If I'd known I was gonna time-travel,
I'd have brought my good ascot.

377
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:07,992
I keep telling y'all,
reality is just a simulation.

378
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,061
Now's not the time
to worry about what's real.

379
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:14,199
That time is in, like, hundreds and
hundreds of years, where we should be.

380
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,800
Well, gang, it looks like we
have another mystery on our...

381
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,203
Ah, just you wait.

382
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:20,004
Any second now,
someone's going to pop out

383
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,140
and yell "Surprise"
or blow a horn.

384
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:25,543
[horn blowing]

385
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:27,011
Ha! Horn!

386
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:31,815
Hear ye! Hear ye!

387
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,384
I, Herald of the court,

388
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:36,653
doth ask you to bow
before the King of Camelot.

389
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,224
The lord of the land.
The knight of the...

390
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,724
[King Arthur]
Oh, get on with it.

391
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,594
- Yes. Um...
- [cat meows]

392
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,166
Peasants and serfs, I give you
King Arthur and Queen Guinevere.

393
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,633
[peasants cheering]

394
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:54,038
Ohh. He's kinda hunky.

395
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,008
I guess, if you're into
authoritarian dictators.

396
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:59,643
He kinda reminds me
of my dad.

397
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,146
[exclaims]

398
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:05,950
Sorry. Sorry. New cape.
Haven't broken it in yet.

399
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:09,653
[peasants exclaiming]

400
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,923
Say, he sure looks familiar.

401
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,463
Unwashed common people, I, your king,
and my brave Knights of the Round Table

402
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,968
have with great effort and sacrifice
finally defeated the villainous Saxons

403
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,004
and brought peace
to the isles.

404
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,972
[woman]
I love your hair.

405
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,409
So, I'm throwing a party!

406
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,112
[cheering]

407
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,482
Uh... It's not a party
for you lot.

408
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:40,485
It's for me. The rightful king
of the Britons,

409
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:43,955
who made you the proud people
you are today.

410
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:47,492
Back straight. Chin up.
Mind the gap.

411
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,694
Now, I'm going to have
my Knights of the Round Table

412
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:53,364
come around
and collect some taxes.

413
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:55,466
[peasants booing]

414
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:00,438
Come on. Pony up.

415
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:03,441
Oh, and, Lancelot,
I'll take that pony.

416
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,880
He is like your dad.
A big meanie.

417
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:12,183
The unwashed common people don't
seem to like him very much.

418
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,852
[gasps] Oh, my gosh.
You're right, Daph.

419
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,588
All right. Good talk.

420
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:18,323
- [thunder rumbling]
- Oh!

421
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:23,528
Oh, not again.

422
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:25,563
Greetings, Arthur.

423
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,099
It is I, Morgan Le Fey.

424
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:32,403
Come to take my rightful place
as ruler of Camelot.

425
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,305
[screaming]

426
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,940
Like, it's her!

427
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,476
[Scooby-Doo whimpering]

428
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,181
Wend home to Avalon,
vile enchantress.

429
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:48,219
You call your folk fair,
yet I judge you anything but.

430
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:53,625
Oh, my gosh. Really? Really?

431
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:56,760
Ah. Ah, sorry. Sorry.

432
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,229
I had butter for lunch.

433
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:01,399
Cede the throne to me,
son of Uther Pendragon,

434
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:04,035
and I shall spare
your miserable life.

435
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:06,704
Uh, my life
is amazing, FYI.

436
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,373
Yeah. Shazing.

437
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:11,376
And also, I'm hiding
behind my knights.

438
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:15,246
You'd have to literally
tear them apart to get to me.

439
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:18,983
[laughs sheepishly]

440
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:23,855
Well, if you won't give me the
throne, I'll just have to take it.

441
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:27,759
- [guards exclaim]
- Oh!

442
00:24:27,824 --> 00:24:28,926
[Queen screams]

[exclaims]

444
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:33,131
King down. King down, everyone.

445
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,868
[laughs]

446
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:39,137

[all gasp]

448
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,477
[all] Huh?

449
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:48,212
- [peasants screaming]
- [Morgan laughs]

450
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:55,153
[laughing]

451
00:24:55,219 --> 00:25:00,124
Soon you will all bow before
me, your true queen!

452
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:01,359
[laughs]

453
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,229
[both] Huh?

454
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:09,400
It's just like the book
we read in the library.

455
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,668
What do you mean?

456
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,470
Remember when Velma was like,
"Blah blah blah.

457
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:15,907
Morgan Le Fey kept on annoying
Norville o'er Morgania"?

458
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,444
That's right.
Until Sir Norville appeared.

459
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,212
Sir Norville.

460
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,147
- That's it!
- Huh? What's it?

461
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:25,016
Why are you looking
at me like that?

462
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:30,822
Because maybe Sir Norville is
actually Shaggy sent back in time.

463
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:33,491
Me? A knight?
With this goatee?

464
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:36,527
Besides, I don't look
anything like the statue.

465
00:25:36,594 --> 00:25:39,464
Oh, so now you're on the
time-travel train too, Velma?

466
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,834
You said it yourself, Daphne.
Science fiction.

467
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,169
Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic.

468
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:47,605
We do seem to have
traveled in time.

469
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,540
We just need
to find out how.

470
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,376
You can say it now.

471
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:55,246
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

472
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:57,215
If we're in the distant past,

473
00:25:57,281 --> 00:25:59,450
then we're currently living out the
legend we read about in the future.

474
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,552
Oh, my brain hurts.

475
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,588
And if we're responsible
for the legend,

476
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:05,923
then we have to do
exactly what it said,

477
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,860
or otherwise we'll mess up
the timeline,

478
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:09,727
which could cause us
to cease to exist,

479
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:13,765
or worse, the whole universe may
implode in a quantum paradox.

480
00:26:13,832 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm telling you,
reality's a simulation, girl.

481
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,569
The universe can't implode
'cause it isn't even real.

482
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:20,938
Daphne, you're not helping
my stomach.

483
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,407
I look at you guys
and I just see

484
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:25,276
zero-one, one-one-zero-
one-one-one-zero.

485
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:28,346
Daph. Daph.
Hand me your phone.

486
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,849
Look.

487
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:32,650
As long as the lock-screen
picture stays the same,

488
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,652
then it means we haven't
changed the timeline.

489
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,722
So, all we have to do is keep
to the legend and we'll be fine.

490
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:40,191
- Mm-hmm.
- So, what do we do next?

491
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:44,228
I've got an idea, but we're going to
need to find more appropriate attire

492
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,731
so we don't stick out
like sore thumbs.

493
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:48,566
[folk music playing]

494
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,508
[Juggler] Oh! [groans]

495
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:04,115
[laughs] Funniest thing
I've seen all night.

496
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:15,359
Hear ye! Hear ye!

497
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:20,031
Presenting Sir Norville of
Crystal Covia and his entourage.

498
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,166
[trumpets playing fanfare]

499
00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:28,506
Like, I, Sir Norville
of Crystal Cove...

500
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:29,875
Ia!

501
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:34,679
Crystal Covia,
do present myself before thy king.

502
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:36,481
Crystal Covia? Hmm.

503
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:38,816
Sounds very new-agey.
Very "witchy."

504
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:42,153
Where is it? What do they wear?
Is it clothes?

505
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,056
Uh, Crystal Covia lies
far across the sea.

506
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:49,026
We have great treasures,
like malt shops and Taco Tuesdays.

507
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:50,761
- And...
- Taco Wednesdays.

508
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:52,463
Taco Wednesdays.

509
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,967
And yes, we mostly wear clothes.
But sometimes also food.

510
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,634
They're slobs.

511
00:27:56,701 --> 00:28:01,072
This sounds like witchcraft
to me. Right? Eh? Am I right?

512
00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:03,140
[both mutter]

513
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:05,878
Yeah, yeah. All right then.
Show it to me.

514
00:28:05,944 --> 00:28:08,412
Let's see it. Bring it on.
Show me the witchcraft.

515
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,281
Your Highness, there is
no such thing as...

516
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:11,850
I know witchcraft.

517
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:16,120
Where I'm from, I was
taught by 1,000 sand-witches.

518
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,688
[Scooby-Doo giggles]

519
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:19,824
[Shaggy] And I'd like to
put you under the spell

520
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:23,628
of a beast from 1,500 years
in your future.

521
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:24,897
The Hoagie!

522
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:27,298
Scooby, let's make history.

523
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:41,345
Now, all we need
is a knife to cut it with.

524
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:43,080
[Scooby-Doo] Shaggy.

525
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,050
That'll work perfectly.

526
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,388
I love your knife holder.
Very rustic.

527
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:55,526
[all gasp]

528
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:04,036
And, like, that's what I call
a Super Shaggy Sandwich.

529
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:05,469
[laughs]

530
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:13,946
Whoa. Hey, I know it's an amazing
sandwich, but come on.

531
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,746
It's just like the legend.

532
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:18,583
You just pulled Excalibur
from the stone.

533
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:21,485
That makes you
the rightful heir to Camelot.

534
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,355
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Whoa there, buster.

535
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:26,223
Pump the horse brakes,
all right?

536
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,561
Pulling an old hunk of metal from
a rock doesn't make one a leader.

537
00:29:30,628 --> 00:29:33,497
It literally says,
"Whosoever pulls the sword

538
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,300
from the stone shall be
the rightful king of Camelot."

539
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,537
You come in here with
your sand-witchcraft,

540
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:42,807
steal my sword, and try
to take my throne as well?

541
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:47,111
That, good sir, or madam,
is just plain rude.

542
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:50,481
I ought to give you a taste
of Camelot's just desserts.

543
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:51,816
[Daphne] Hold on, boys.

544
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,019
There has to be
a way we can settle this.

545
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,420
- I'm cool with pie.
- Oh, we will.

546
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,925
We will settle this. Like men!

547
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,425
[Merlin] <i>Hold!</i>

548
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:03,394
Huh?

549
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,068
Who's that?

550
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:12,470
It's me. I'm Merlin.

551
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:13,704
[Shaggy and Scooby-Doo] Merlin?

552
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,406
Merlin? Where?

553
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:17,642
[all gasp]

554
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,310
Ah, yes. Me again.

555
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:23,381
I'm Merlin the Magician,
master of knowledge and mystical secrets.

556
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,485
Merlin, you're always spoiling
my fun. Just like my mum.

557
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:30,454
- Beard and all.
- Hmm.

558
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:32,323
If there's one thing
I can't stand,

559
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,792
it's adulty people
acting like children.

560
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,861
[blows raspberry]

561
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:38,629
[exclaims]

562
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:40,899
All this noisy arguing is
what brought me down here.

563
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:44,002
I'm a busy wizard
and I need to focus, right?

564
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,038
Sorry, Mr. Merlin.

565
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:48,539
But our friend Shaggy here pulled the
sword from the stone, so technically...

566
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:51,342
[groaning]

567
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,744
Yeah. How can there be
two kings at one time?

568
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:57,548
Uh, well, there can't be, can there?
Hmm? You bunch of numpties.

569
00:30:57,615 --> 00:31:00,651
You gotta solve this like
the adulty people you are.

570
00:31:04,588 --> 00:31:07,792
With a winner-take-all melee
for the crown!

571
00:31:11,863 --> 00:31:13,397
Hear ye! Hear ye!

572
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:15,100
To determine
the true king,

573
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,569
the prospects must test
their skill upon one another.

574
00:31:18,636 --> 00:31:22,273
The champion becoming
the king of Camelot!

575
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,742
[cheering]

576
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:26,711
Like, I'm gonna
have to compete?

577
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:29,948
Because, to be honest,
I'm pretty sure you could take me.

578
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,917
[laughs]

579
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:33,751
We're nobility.

580
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:35,954
Nobility doesn't
fight one another.

581
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:39,690
We get the unwashed commoners
to fight on our behalf.

582
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:41,225
[both] Phew.

583
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:45,362
Us, sweating? Waving our arms around?
Can you imagine?

584
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:46,764
Drumstick?

585
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:48,967
Looks like you boys
have got this sorted.

586
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,335
There's a whole arsenal
down there to choose from.

587
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:54,973
[all chanting]
Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal!

00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:05,516
[exclaims]

590
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:09,286
Right then.
Let's get down to it.

591
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:13,657
I choose, uh, Sir Galahad.

592
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:14,860
[crowd cheering]

593
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,763
Um, I choose...

594
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,999
Hold on, mate.
I'm not done yet.

595
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:25,636
Sir Percival, Sir Tristan,
Gawain, Sir Kay, Sir Kay, Sir...

596
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:27,738
[Shaggy] What if... Could I...
I was... Could I, please...

597
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:29,473
[King Arthur] Bedivere,
Sir Kay...

598
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,742
- Sir...
- And I want that pony.

599
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:32,944
[pony whinnies]

600
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,578
- [Shaggy] I'll take...
- [King Arthur] Um...

601
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:35,646
- Bors the Younger.
- [Shaggy] It would be great...

602
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:36,781
[King Arthur] Sir Lamorak...

603
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:38,482
- [Shaggy] I choose...
- And...

604
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:46,657
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

605
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:54,331
[grunts]

606
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:57,035
Fine. I guess. Sir Lancelot.

607
00:32:57,836 --> 00:32:58,937
Yes!

608
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:01,438
[Shaggy gulps]

609
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,909
Like, I'd like a knight
to fight for right,

610
00:33:03,975 --> 00:33:06,310
but there isn't
one in sight.

611
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:10,781
I, Fred of Ascot,

612
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:14,318
do volunteer to fight
on Sir Norville's behalf.

613
00:33:14,385 --> 00:33:16,453
Are you sure
you're up for this, Fred?

614
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,989
You're a big tough guy,

615
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:20,758
but those are
crazy-ripped man-men.

616
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:25,964
For sure, Daph.

617
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:28,399
As long as you're there
to cheer me on, we'll be fine.

618
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:32,803
Besides, the way I figure it,
according to legend, we've already won.

619
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:34,371
What's there
to be afraid of?

620
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:36,074
[sighs heavily]

621
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:41,512
The Black Plague. Deranged highwaymen.
Giant brown bears.

622
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,748
Dysentery.
Armies of angry orcs...

623
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:47,551
[crowd cheering]

624
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:53,657
Just the one, eh? [laughing]

625
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,262
At least your mum thinks
you're cool. [laughs]

626
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,232
Come on, Velma. Find a way
to get us out of here.

627
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,935
I'm on it. If anyone knows
what's up here, it's Merlin.

628
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:14,946
[growling]

629
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:22,020
[growling continues]

630
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,057
[Velma exclaims]

631
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:27,658
[groans]

632
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,793
[dramatic music playing]

633
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:31,863
[growling]

634
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,465
[gasping]

00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,872
[burps]

636
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:41,873
[Merlin exclaims]

637
00:34:43,741 --> 00:34:46,744
- Merlin?
- Oh. Hello.

638
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,116
Sorry. I didn't hear you come
in over my burping fire and all.

639
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:59,124
Um, I've come
seeking knowledge.

640
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,929
Oh. You must be my sister Karen's friend.
I can teach you.

641
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:06,998
- Uh...
- Oh, that's fantastic.

642
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:09,234
You know, Karen's the one
that gave me the idea.

643
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,970
She's like "Can you breathe
fire?" And I'm like "Yes."

644
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:14,005
And then she's like,
"But can you belch the alphabet?"

645
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:16,507
And I'm like,
"Oh, my gosh. Yes, I can."

646
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:20,211
Why has no one ever combined
these two things before? [laughs]

647
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:25,749
[burping] A, B, C, D, E,
F, G.

648
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:28,719
I'm getting stuck on the G.

649
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:33,757
Hey, Merlin, or whoever you want
to call yourself, I'm having a day.

650
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:36,560
[chuckles] That's what
tea's for, my darling.

651
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:43,969
I think you might have
a time machine or something.

652
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:45,569
- A device...
- [grumbles]

653
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:47,305
Okay.
Maybe you call it "magic."

654
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:49,274
Whatever it is,
I need to learn how to use it

655
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:51,876
so I can send my friends
and myself back home.

656
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:55,180
Oh. So you want to be
a sorcerer's assistant, huh?

657
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:59,184
To learn the arcane secrets what
make the world turn like a platter.

658
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,720
Then this is where your quest
for knowledge begins.

659
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:06,958
Uh, what am I supposed
to do with this?

660
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:10,895
When the time comes,
you will know what to do with it.

661
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:14,399
Can't I just have access
to your time machine?

662
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,268
Oh. Is that all you wanted?

663
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:20,804
I call it a "sun dial."

664
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:24,175
Ugh. I'm gonna need magic
just to get through this day.

665
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,714
Well, how do I look?

666
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,584
Like my knight
in shining armor.

667
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,654
Mine, too.

668
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:41,092
Thanks, Scoob.
Well, time to go.

669
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:45,196
Oh, I think not.

670
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:46,697
Morgan!

671
00:36:46,764 --> 00:36:49,800
- Why, I ought to...
- Freeze!

672
00:36:52,437 --> 00:36:54,638
I... I can't move.

673
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,707
Let him go.

674
00:36:56,774 --> 00:36:59,044
Don't worry.
It's only temporary.

675
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,080
But long enough
to stop him from competing.

676
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:06,184
Now nothing can stop me from
taking the throne from Arthur.

677
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,719
[cackles]

678
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,126
- What are we gonna do?
- Fred can't joust like this.

679
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:16,660
He'll have to forfeit,

680
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:19,297
and King Arthur will win,
which means we might...

681
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,199
Poof. Disappear.

682
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:25,003
No. We have to give Velma
more time to figure things out.

683
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,407
I've got a plan.
A plan so crazy it might just work.

684
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:33,211
[crowd] Fred! Fred! Fred!

685
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,048
Uh, where's your knight?

686
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:38,950
Uh, I don't know.

687

[peasants exclaiming]

689
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:51,162
[female peasant] Is that
a lady on a horse?

690
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,131
Is that a non-man?

691
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:56,201
No. That's Daphne.
Where's Fred?

692
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,702
Felled by dark magic.
I'm standing in.

693
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:02,207
A non-man
doing sporty man things?

694
00:38:02,273 --> 00:38:03,308
That's a laugh, isn't it?

695
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:05,910
Ha! Well, Norville,
after you lose,

696
00:38:05,977 --> 00:38:07,846
maybe I can find a job
for you on my staff.

697
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,714
What are your thoughts
on waste removal?

698
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:12,816
I've got a few
ripe buckets of...

699
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:15,453
Actually, King Arthur,
in my land, non-men...

700
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,622
Uh, women can do whatever
they put their minds to.

701
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,492
And some of them
are pretty scary.

- [Fred] Smite him, Daph!
- [gasps]

713
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,258
Smite that knight
right in the snoot.

00:39:27,325 --> 00:39:29,527

[exclaiming]

You fight like a girl,
so I'll go easy on you.

[grunts]

721
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,319
Oh, I was just dodging.
Was I supposed to be fighting?

722
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:57,255
Look, little girl, first off,
you're skinny as a...

723
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,026
[Daphne exclaims]

724
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:05,129
- Stick.
- Don't worry.

725
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:07,098
Those dents will
buff right out.

726
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:09,567
- [Shaggy laughing]
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

727
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:14,305
Lancelot just got beat
by a girl! [laughing]

728
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:16,941
That's a point for you.
But so worth it.

729
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:19,344
- Cheese?
- Cheese.

730
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,311
[Shaggy] Mmm.

[peasants cheering]

00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:24,682
Sir Daphne, you're my

Yes!

[peanut vendor] Peanuts.
Anybody want peanuts?

741
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:05,822
Gimme two.
I don't carry money.

This is it. He's the last
knight on Arthur's side.

746
00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:26,944
I want Daph to win, but, you know,
I also kinda want her to lose.

747
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,513
Go get him, Daph.

748
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,815
Here. For luck.

749
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:36,054
Go get him, Daphne.

750
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:40,091
Oh. I can't look.

- I won!
- You won!

757
00:41:57,442 --> 00:42:00,311
[both] Ugh! This is the worst
thing that's ever happened.

00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:01,846
[Morgan] At last!

[thunder rumbles]

760
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:09,120
Now, with the king chosen, I have

- [Scooby-Doo gasps]
- [Fred exclaims]

00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:24,502
As I perform this ancient rite,
it will cause a big, terrible fight.

763
00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:28,573
As swords clash and clang,
you'll go out with a bang!

764
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:34,145
As you're slain by my wicked Black Knight!

That is your doom.

768
00:42:54,098 --> 00:42:56,835

[Black Knight grunting]

Huh?

Finish her!

And you've learned the wizarding ways.

Look. She's got
magic pajamas.

780
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:43,281
Yeah, Merlin gave
me these robes,

781
00:43:43,347 --> 00:43:45,483
but I didn't learn
squat up there.

782

- [Black Knight growling]
- Magic is nonsense.

783
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:51,857
I'm here to save you the new-fashioned way.

Shaggy, the sword.

797
00:44:41,907 --> 00:44:43,374
The sword?

Heh. Barney.

It rhymes with trouble.

Wait. How do you know about Barney Rubble?
He's from the future.

How do I learn
how to do that?

He says it's magic.

825

Ah, young apprentice.

831
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:29,714
You must study even harder if
you're to become a proper wizard.

832
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,583
Study what? The stuff in
this book is nonsense.

833
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,752
I just want to
time-travel back home.

834
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:37,055
This is all just bad
limericks and gobbledygook.

835
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:40,859
To a wizard, gobbledygook is
the most important kind of gook.

When the time is right, young lad,
you'll know just how to use that book.

But, please, Merlin.
I just have to...

I think not!

Farewell, you miscreants.

When next we meet,
it will be your doom!

We better hurry. Look.

Our future is fading
out of existence.

If we don't find out where Shaggy
went, we'll cease to be,

Ooh, ooh, ooh. I know this one.
Uh, I know where he went.

863
00:47:53,865 --> 00:47:56,734
To Morgan's Keep.
Not far from here.

864
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,402
Really creepy.

get inside.

00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:05,376
[gulps] Deadly traps?

869
00:48:05,443 --> 00:48:09,380
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Deadly traps.
Awesome. Good luck.

870
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:10,815
Hope you get
your mate back.

871

He's your friend, too.

[exclaims] I don't need a mate.
I'm a king. I have hoagies.

Uh, hoagies!

874
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,262
How can you eat
at a time like this?

875
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:29,868
Yeah. Even Scooby knows that when a friend's
in trouble, you drop everything for them.

876
00:48:29,935 --> 00:48:31,002
Even snacks.

877
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:35,239
I told you. Shaggy's not my...

878

[music playing]

879
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,695
Shaggy is my mate.

880
00:48:57,762 --> 00:49:00,531
Or the closest I've got to one.

881
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,203
My whole life is a lie. [sobs]

882
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:07,438
So you'll join the Scooby
Gang while we rescue him?

883
00:49:07,505 --> 00:49:11,776
No. Are you mad? I'm not leaving this
castle without a bunch of knights.

884
00:49:11,843 --> 00:49:14,146
Oh, no. I think
I broke them all.

Um, kneel.

I, Arthur Pendragon,
King of Camelot,

and the rightful
wielder of Excalibur,

do dub thee Knights
of the Round Table.

I love your hair!

[dramatic music playing]

895
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:33,959
[Velma] So, this is it?
Huh. That's strange.

896
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:35,593
[Daphne] What, Velma?

897
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:38,163
Oh, nothing. I just could have
sworn we've been here before.

898
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,766
Oh, you would remember if you had.
Welcome to Morgan's Keep.

899
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:45,871
This cave leads down
into the bowels of the Earth,

Remember, we're here
to save Shaggy.

903
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:57,448
Say, Arthur, how are we going
to get across that moat?

904
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:01,752
[Velma] Well,
that's not creepy.

905
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:08,360
There. Down that corridor.

906
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:09,961
What are we waiting for?

907
00:51:10,661 --> 00:51:11,863
[Daphne] Whoa!

908
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,535
Oh, it's the gauntlet
of deadly traps.

909
00:51:18,602 --> 00:51:20,471
Oh, right. I forgot.

910
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:23,774
Velma, can you get us across with
your powers as a student wizard?

911
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:24,976
I can try.

912
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:28,179
[sighs] So silly.
[clears throat]

I guess not.

Well, we gave
it a good go.

920

If we head back now, we'll be just
in time for tea and jellied eels.

We can't leave.

922
00:51:52,803 --> 00:51:54,839
Then what are
we gonna do?

923
00:51:54,906 --> 00:51:58,542
You're the master of traps, Fred.
You can figure this out.

No. Am I an artist?

I, uh, hadn't really
thought about it.

Sorry. What does
this do again?

931
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:36,513
I used the bow we brought
with us to make a trebuchet

932
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,285
that will throw a stone through
the hallway, pulling the sled,

which will slide us past the traps
before they're able to do anything.

It's an antitrap trap.

[King Arthur yells]

945
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:45,450
Well, and Bob's your uncle.
We made it.

946
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:48,253
Sir Fred, you are
a regular anorak.

947
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,257
Actually, I think I'm half-Dutch
or Norway-ese or something.

948
00:53:57,128 --> 00:54:00,065
- [King Arthur yells]
- Huh?

949
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:05,736
[grunting]

950
00:54:06,538 --> 00:54:08,139
[straining]

951
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:12,810
I knew you could do it.
[laughs]

952
00:54:12,877 --> 00:54:15,579
Thanks, guys, but come on.
We've gotta save Shaggy.

953
00:54:15,646 --> 00:54:16,713
[King Arthur yells]

954
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:21,953
Huh?

955
00:54:26,925 --> 00:54:28,193
[grunts]

956
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:39,003
[loud munching]

957
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,239
Sorry. What's that
horrible noise?

958
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:44,309
- More deadly traps?
- It's Shaggy.

959
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,376
[Scooby-Doo giggles]

960
00:54:50,215 --> 00:54:53,251
- [Scooby-Doo exclaims]
- [Shaggy laughs]

961
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:56,254
Scooby-Doo. It's great
to see you, pal.

962
00:54:56,321 --> 00:55:00,391
- Shaggy, are you all right?
- I am now that you're here.

963
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:02,793
Hors d'oeuvres?

964
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:04,596
Come on. We gotta
get out of here.

965
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:08,900
He has a point. Waste not, want not.
That's what I always say.

966
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,035
Stand back.

967
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:23,780
- [munching loudly]
- Oh.

968
00:55:35,692 --> 00:55:36,928

- [meows]
- [coins jingling]

971
00:55:52,776 --> 00:55:56,481
- Now can we go?
- Yep. Food's gone.

972
00:55:56,548 --> 00:55:57,582
[burps]

973
00:55:57,649 --> 00:55:58,883
It's too late.

974
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,052
The picture. It's gone.

975
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,754
Whatever we did,
we just made the timeline worse.

976
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,857
Now the phone
isn't even working,

977
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:08,759
as if the technology
itself was disappearing.

978
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:09,994
We've failed.

979
00:56:10,061 --> 00:56:11,963
[Morgan] Right, you are!

980
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,902
[exclaims]

981
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,272
Ha! Finally!

982
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:23,575
Now with Excalibur
in my hand

983
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:26,810
and Sir Norville having granted
me the deed to the throne...

984
00:56:26,878 --> 00:56:28,179
Deed to the throne?

985
00:56:28,246 --> 00:56:30,448
Yes. For as much food
as he could eat.

986
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:33,551
[laughs] It's all here.
Legal and everything.

987
00:56:33,618 --> 00:56:35,253
Shaggy, you didn't?

988
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,222
Why would I want
a seat on the throne

989
00:56:37,288 --> 00:56:39,357
when I've got some tea and a scone?
[laughs]

990
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:42,093
Now, with this deed
and the sword,

991
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,865
I am the rightful ruler
of all of Camelot. [laughs]

992
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:51,735
[Shaggy] Huh?

993
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:54,672
Only if you can
hold onto it.

994
00:56:54,738 --> 00:56:58,176
You think you can
defeat me? [laughs]

995
00:56:58,243 --> 00:57:01,346
I am the greatest
sorceress of all time,

996
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:04,916
but this battle
is going to drag on.

997
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:07,452
Drag on. Get it?

998
00:57:07,518 --> 00:57:09,220
This is my dumb little joke,

999
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:12,290
since you all seem to like
making dumb little jokes so much.

1000
00:57:15,326 --> 00:57:17,929
Uh-oh.
I don't like this pun.

1001
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:22,000
[Scooby-Doo gasps]

1002
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:24,235
- [all gasp]
- Dragon!

1003
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,738
Uh-oh. Oh.
That's not good.

1004
00:57:26,803 --> 00:57:29,474
- Oh! Oh!
- [dragon roars]

[roars]

1007
00:57:38,883 --> 00:57:45,023
I am Morgan Le Fey, ruler of
Camelot, and I am hungry.

1008
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:46,658
- [Shaggy exclaims]
- [Scooby-Doo exclaims]

[dragon roars]

1010
00:57:50,161 --> 00:57:52,864
Guys, this table
is built really well,

1011
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,899
but I don't think
it can take another blast.

1012
00:57:59,604 --> 00:58:02,307
We're gonna need some real
magic to get us out of this one.

1013
00:58:02,373 --> 00:58:04,142
Have you gotten
good yet, Velma?

1014
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:07,145
No. But I know one word that
always works for this gang.

1015
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:09,314
[roars]

1016
00:58:11,649 --> 00:58:15,586
- What's that?
- Run! Follow me!

1017
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:20,391
Like, if you can't take the heat,
get out of the dragon's lair. [whimpers]

1018
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,265

You cannot escape me!

[all panting]

1035
00:59:57,922 --> 01:00:01,192
Come on, King Arthur.
Put the dragons right behind us.

1036
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:03,995
Go, Shaggy. [straining]

1037
01:00:04,061 --> 01:00:06,564
I can't hold this door forever.

1038
01:00:07,198 --> 01:00:08,666
Jump, Shaggy!

1039
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,541
Demon dogs, Shaggy. Go!

1040
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:19,010
[Shaggy yelling]

1041
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:29,654
[gasps] King Arthur.

1042
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,489
- [Daphne gasps]
- I'm sure he's fine.

1043
01:00:37,195 --> 01:00:40,031
- [exclaims]
- [all gasp]

1044
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:51,709
You thought you could
escape me, you fools.

1045
01:00:51,776 --> 01:00:56,882
If you have any last words,
the time has come to use them.

1046
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:59,550
[Merlin] <i>When the time
is right, young lad,</i>

1047
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:02,453
<i>you'll know just
how to use that book.</i>

1048
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:40,124
[cheering]

1049
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:51,435
Thank you. Because of you,
we can wake up to a brighter tomorrow.

1050
01:01:51,502 --> 01:01:55,740
Tomorrow? Velma, the picture.
Has it come back?

1051
01:01:57,742 --> 01:01:59,310
- Nope.
- Oh, no.

1052
01:01:59,377 --> 01:02:01,312
You mean we've destroyed
the future?

1053
01:02:01,379 --> 01:02:04,850
No more video games?
No more double cheeseburgers?

1054
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:07,019
No more Scooby Snacks?

1055
01:02:07,084 --> 01:02:09,086
[both crying]

1056
01:02:10,254 --> 01:02:12,991
And no way to return home.

1057
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:14,525
Don't worry, Sir Fred.

1058
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:17,061
You can join me and
my Knights of the Round Table.

1059
01:02:17,128 --> 01:02:18,496
All of you can.

1060
01:02:18,563 --> 01:02:22,066
Together, we can make
the world a better place.

1061
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:24,569
Create a kingdom
where everyone is welcome

1062
01:02:24,635 --> 01:02:27,405
as long as they fight
on the side of right.

1063
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:31,877
Together, we can make Camelot
a beacon on the hill,

1064
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:35,580
shining a light into
the darkest of places.

1065
01:02:36,213 --> 01:02:38,884
Bravo. Bravo.

1066
01:02:38,951 --> 01:02:40,585
Velma, what are you doing?

1067
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:43,688
Oh, just applauding
these fine performers.

1068
01:02:43,754 --> 01:02:47,124
I guess that's the end of your
little show then, isn't it?

1069
01:02:49,327 --> 01:02:50,728
[crowd stops
cheering, exclaims]

1070
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:58,502
[all] Mrs. Wentworth?

1071
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:00,671
Is she trapped
back in time, too?

1072
01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:04,910
No, Shaggy. She's not back in
time, and neither are we.

1073
01:03:04,977 --> 01:03:06,677
But the photo on the phone.

1074
01:03:06,744 --> 01:03:09,081
Forgot to charge it.
It just went dead.

1075
01:03:09,146 --> 01:03:11,582
But all the magic.
The flying, the lights...

1076
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:13,885
Heck, when she did
that spell to freeze me.

1077
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:16,554
It's like I thought.
There was no magic.

1078
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:18,823
<i>It was all just
wires, sleep gas,</i>

1079
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:22,226
<i>and the light show that the mayor said
the town was going to show us later on.</i>

1080
01:03:22,293 --> 01:03:24,295
As for the freezing,

1081
01:03:24,362 --> 01:03:27,365
we all know you're kind of impressionable
when someone yells in your direction.

1082
01:03:27,431 --> 01:03:29,868
- What? That's not...
- Jump!

1083
01:03:30,836 --> 01:03:32,536
Okay. Good to know.

1084
01:03:34,472 --> 01:03:37,976
So, the people,
they were what? Actors?

1085
01:03:38,043 --> 01:03:39,610
Not just any actors.

1086
01:03:39,677 --> 01:03:43,180
This in none other than that
wonderful British thespian,

1087
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:44,715
Winston Pilkingstonshire.

1088
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:47,119
[together]
Winston Pilkingstonshire?

1089
01:03:47,184 --> 01:03:51,155
[gasps] He's the actor who plays
Thundarr the Barbarian on TV.

1090
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:52,790
- Right?
- Right.

1091
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:55,660
I got even more suspicious
when Arthur said "demon dogs,"

1092
01:03:55,726 --> 01:03:57,762
one of Thundarr's
catchphrases.

1093
01:03:57,828 --> 01:04:01,632
You know, you say the same lines
for 30 years, they're hard to shake.

1094
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:04,002
But what really gave it away
were the abs.

1095
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:06,303
I'd know those abs anywhere.

1096
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:08,172
Whoa. Will you sign my tunic?

1097
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,410
Yes, it's me and my abs.

1098
01:04:12,476 --> 01:04:17,248
But we couldn't have done it without this
marvelous medieval Renaissance troupe.

1099
01:04:17,314 --> 01:04:20,418
Everyone, please,
take a bow.

1100
01:04:22,054 --> 01:04:24,488
Velma, amazing deduction.

1101
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:26,590
It's true. I was hired to be
the inaugural actor

1102
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:31,429
to play King Arthur in Norville o'er
Morgania's newest tourist attraction,

1103
01:04:31,495 --> 01:04:33,664
Camelot Reimagined.

1104
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:38,402
Camelot Reimagined?
What is that?

1105
01:04:38,469 --> 01:04:40,438
It should be obvious, Daphne.

1106
01:04:40,504 --> 01:04:43,207
<i>Do you remember when we first
arrived at Norville o'er Morgania?</i>

1107
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:47,344
<i>We reached that roundabout with the
one road blocked off for construction.</i>

1108
01:04:47,411 --> 01:04:50,448
This must be some sort of
immersive attraction

1109
01:04:50,514 --> 01:04:52,884
built right next to the town
to attract tourists.

1110
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:56,054
In fact, with the way that Camelot
is centered in this small valley

1111
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:58,957
to obscure what's on the other
side of that stand of trees

1112
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:02,493
and how the castle only has
windows facing one side,

1113
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,229
I'm willing to bet that
Norville o'er Morgania

1114
01:05:05,296 --> 01:05:07,331
is actually only
a couple of miles away.

1115
01:05:07,398 --> 01:05:12,403
She's right. And you five are
our first guests to take part

1116
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:16,141
in what we hope will be a very
lucrative entertainment experience.

1117
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:19,677
Yeah, but did they have to knock
us out to pretend it was real?

1118
01:05:19,744 --> 01:05:21,980
Actually, they did, Shaggy.

1119
01:05:22,047 --> 01:05:23,982
- All because of you.
- Me?

1120
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,484
Do you remember
the legend of Sir Norville?

1121
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,353
It said that if Norville
or any of his line returned,

1122
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,722
they would lay claim
to the land of Camelot.

1123
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:33,992
When the mayor
found out about your lineage

1124
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,627
<i>and saw your ancient medallion
with the inscription of Camelot,</i>

1125
01:05:36,694 --> 01:05:39,730
<i>he was convinced you were
here to lay claim to the town.</i>

1126
01:05:39,797 --> 01:05:42,000
[Mrs. Wentworth]
<i>Precisely. After he met Shaggy,</i>

1127
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:44,702
<i>he organized a town meeting
and told everyone</i>

1128
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:46,838
<i>they would have to do
whatever it takes</i>

1129
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:49,707
<i>to get you to sign over the
deed for the land to the town.</i>

1130
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:52,144
Like, I don't wanna
own real estate.

1131
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,980
- You don't?
- Ma'am, no way.

1132
01:05:55,046 --> 01:05:57,581
Do you know how many
creepy, evil people we've met

1133
01:05:57,648 --> 01:06:00,018
that do weird things
just for a piece of land?

1134
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:04,256
[chuckles] No offense,
but I'd gladly sign over the deed.

1135
01:06:04,321 --> 01:06:06,024
Just give me the paperwork.

1136
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,959
That's very sweet, Shaggy.

1137
01:06:08,026 --> 01:06:12,030
Luckily, you've already
signed the deed... over to me!

1138
01:06:14,065 --> 01:06:15,699
Ha-ha!

1139
01:06:15,766 --> 01:06:19,670
Um, this is definitely not
part of the script.

1140
01:06:19,737 --> 01:06:22,673
I know because I memorized the
entire thing, everyone's parts.

1141
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,742
I always do.
It's just a thing.

1142
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:28,646
These ignorant townspeople put everything
into this King Arthur experience,

1143
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:31,249
wanting to split the profits
between everyone.

1144
01:06:31,315 --> 01:06:35,187
But you know what's better than splitting
profits with hundreds of people?

1145
01:06:35,253 --> 01:06:37,388
Splitting them with no one!

1146
01:06:37,454 --> 01:06:39,824
Once I send this to
the proper authorities,

1147
01:06:39,891 --> 01:06:43,261
this town and the money
it makes will be mine!

1148
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,329
[laughing]

1149
01:06:45,396 --> 01:06:47,698
She's trying to get away.
Get her!

1150
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,568
[Fred] Look out!

1151
01:06:58,475 --> 01:07:00,411
And there goes my retirement.

1152
01:07:00,477 --> 01:07:03,380
All she has to do is mail that
deed and the town is hers.

1153
01:07:03,447 --> 01:07:04,782
We have to stop her.

1154
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,584
Where's the nearest mailbox?

1155
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,287
Uh, what's a mailbox, Sir Fred?

1156
01:07:09,353 --> 01:07:11,256
We're not acting anymore,
you twit.

1157
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:13,724
Oh, right, mate.
Sorry, sorry.

1158
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,459
It's about two kilometers
that way

1159
01:07:15,526 --> 01:07:17,628
in the center
of Norville o'er Morgania.

1160
01:07:17,695 --> 01:07:21,498
But she's too far away.
There's no way we can catch up to her.

1161
01:07:21,565 --> 01:07:23,134
No, there is a way.

1162
01:07:26,503 --> 01:07:28,073
[buzzer sounds]

1163
01:07:30,474 --> 01:07:33,078
Ariel, Ookla, ride!

1164
01:07:38,415 --> 01:07:39,851
Do you wanna?

1165
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:41,485
No. You be Ariel.

1166
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:43,721
I'm Ookla, naturally.

1167
01:07:47,391 --> 01:07:48,860
[engine revs]

1168
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:03,474
Those fools. With this deed,
there's nothing to stop me

1169
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:06,777
from owning this town
once and for all.

1170
01:08:06,845 --> 01:08:07,778
Huh?

1171
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:14,752
This is your idea?

1172
01:08:14,818 --> 01:08:17,122
Don't worry, love.
It's just a converted lorry.

1173
01:08:17,188 --> 01:08:18,789
A baby could drive it.

1174
01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:23,494
See? What did
I tell you? Easy-peasy.

1175
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,430
[laughing] Like,
this is amazing!

1176
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:41,313
[Shaggy] She's getting away!

1177
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:42,446
Huh?

1178
01:08:47,986 --> 01:08:49,220
[all exclaiming]

1179
01:08:59,931 --> 01:09:01,498
[shrieks]

1180
01:09:05,736 --> 01:09:07,571
We've gotta put her down.

1181
01:09:07,638 --> 01:09:09,473
All right. Winston's got it.

1182
01:09:12,077 --> 01:09:13,144
[all exclaiming]

1183
01:09:20,684 --> 01:09:22,053
[Winston] Hold on, everyone.

1184
01:09:30,694 --> 01:09:33,664
Lords of Light, that was fun!

1185
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:36,034
- Oh, let's go again.
- Ariel rules!

1186
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:39,037
We made it.
We, like, survived.

1187
01:09:39,104 --> 01:09:40,939
[sighs]

1188
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:42,907
[all exclaiming]

1189
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:46,244
But you failed in your quest!

1190
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:51,249
Not yet we haven't,
vile sorceress. [chuckling]

1191
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:56,587
Fly true, my beauty!

1192
01:09:59,924 --> 01:10:01,960
And for good measure...

1193
01:10:04,029 --> 01:10:05,030
[gasps]

1194
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,870
What? No fair!

1195
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:15,572
Oh, my.
What's going on here?

1196
01:10:15,639 --> 01:10:19,576
Well, Mayor, we know about you and the
town trying to gaslight us into thinking

1197
01:10:19,643 --> 01:10:21,046
we were trapped
in the Dark Ages

1198
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:23,381
in order to claim this land
as your own.

1199
01:10:23,448 --> 01:10:26,151
But, then, you didn't think
your town librarian

1200
01:10:26,217 --> 01:10:28,652
would try to steal
the deed for herself.

1201
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,554
I would've gotten
away with it, too,

1202
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:33,058
if it wasn't for you
meddling kids.

1203
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:34,825
And... And...

1204
01:10:34,893 --> 01:10:37,694
A little bit of
Scooby Gang magic.

1205
01:10:39,397 --> 01:10:43,301
Well, I'm assuming that you'll
want to lay claim to the land then.

1206
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,836
No way.

1207
01:10:44,903 --> 01:10:47,872
This land belongs to you
and the rest of the town.

1208
01:10:47,939 --> 01:10:50,275
I'm actually pretty proud
to know my ancestors

1209
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:53,311
came from such imaginative
and entrepreneurial people.

1210
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:55,779
Well, then there's only
one thing left to do.

1211
01:10:55,847 --> 01:10:57,581
What's that, Mayor?

1212
01:10:57,648 --> 01:10:59,284
Party!

1213
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,119
[lively music playing]

1214
01:11:03,922 --> 01:11:07,959
Not a bad way to spend our vacation.
Wouldn't you say so, Sir Fred?

1215
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:11,062
Not bad at all,
Sir Daphne.

1216
01:11:11,129 --> 01:11:14,199
So, was any of it real,
Mr. Pilkingstonshire?

1217
01:11:14,265 --> 01:11:17,135
Our budding bromance?
The sandwiches?

1218
01:11:17,202 --> 01:11:19,104
- Any of it?
- I'm an actor, Shaggy,

1219
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:22,340
but there are some things
you just can't fake.

1220
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:25,676
One of those things
is a love of sandwiches.

1221
01:11:25,742 --> 01:11:29,080
Watch the sandwich scene in <i>Citizen Kane.</i>
You'll see what I mean.

1222
01:11:30,849 --> 01:11:32,984
Friendship is another one,
Shaggy.

1223
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:35,286
You kids aren't so bad,
for septics.

1224
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:38,857
Uh, septic tanks. Yanks.

1225
01:11:38,923 --> 01:11:41,326
I've got a wonderful
beach house in the UK.

1226
01:11:41,392 --> 01:11:42,927
You must come sometime.

1227
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:45,196
And stay in a hotel
nearby.

1228
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:47,298
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

1229
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:49,901
I'm still not sure
how you pulled it off.

1230
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:52,937
The blasts of cold air,
fireballs, flying...

1231
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:54,738
It all felt so real.

1232
01:11:54,805 --> 01:11:57,041
Magic is real, Velma.

1233
01:11:57,108 --> 01:12:01,179
You just have to look
deep within to find it.

1234
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:05,850
Okay, I get it. A magician never
tells how he did the trick.

1235
01:12:05,917 --> 01:12:08,153
Now, young apprentice,
I gotta run.

1236
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:10,054
Remember the lessons
I've taught you, hmm?

1237
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:13,591
Once you suss out magic,
there's nothing you can't get up to.

1238
01:12:13,657 --> 01:12:16,194
Sure. Thank you, "Merlin."

1239
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:18,029
It's been surreal.

1240
01:12:19,663 --> 01:12:21,833
Tatty-bye.

1241
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,736
Where is your friend going?
He's going to miss the fireworks show.

1242
01:12:25,802 --> 01:12:27,771
My friend?
You mean Merlin?

1243
01:12:27,839 --> 01:12:29,706
Isn't he
one of the townspeople?

1244
01:12:29,773 --> 01:12:32,310
No. Never seen him
before in my life.

1245
01:12:32,377 --> 01:12:35,113
- We thought he was with you.
- He's not with me.

1246
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,681
And if he's not
with you, then...

1247
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:40,251
