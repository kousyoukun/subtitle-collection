1
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:26,123
Listen carefully, my son.

2
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:29,627
By now, Kalel, you are entering

3
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,630
the atmosphere of
the planet known as earth.

4
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:36,133
I pray you have made
a safe journey.

5
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,637
The yellow sun of your new home

6
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:41,639
will give you
great physical powers,

7
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,643
but It cannot
console your spirit.

8
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:49,648
Placed aboard this vessel
Is an energy module,

9
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:54,151
all that remains of
a once powerful civilization...

10
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:57,656
krypton, your mother planet.

11
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,658
It Is my last gift to you.

12
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:03,160
Once removed,

13
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:06,163
the ship will grow
cold and silent,

14
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:09,166
and you will be finally alone.

15
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:15,673
The power In the module
can be used but once.

16
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:19,678
Use It wisely, my son.

17
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,920
Clark, you out here?

18
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:54,921
Clark Kent!

19
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:56,922
Hi, Mr. Hornsby.

20
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:57,923
Over here.

21
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,925
Ah, there you are.

22
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:00,925
How are you, Sir?

23
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:01,928
Oh, I'm fine, Clark,
how are you?

24
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:04,430
Nice to see you.
It's been a long time.

25
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,432
A long time.

26
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,435
I was just tidying up
for when you show the place.

27
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:09,936
Yeah, well, didn't I mention

28
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,937
there's an offer
to buy sight unseen?

29
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:15,441
I won't sell
to a big developer.

30
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:18,444
Anybody who buys it
has to want a real farm.

31
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:19,946
I don't think we need
another shopping center.

32
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:23,449
Darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

33
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,951
Today, nobody wants a farm.

34
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:29,955
You blink your eye,
and they'll all be gone.

35
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,458
That's progress.

36
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,461
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

37
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:41,467
Oh, what a joker
old Jonathan Kent was.

38
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:45,971
I asked him what happened
to the baby's crib,

39
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,474
and he said...

40
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:52,978
"little Clark must have
had a bad dream and kicked it."

41
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,981
yeah, dad liked a good joke.

42
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,483
I was wondering, Mr. Hornsby,

43
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:58,984
maybe you'd like to keep these

44
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:01,487
for your grandchildren.

45
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:04,490
Why, thank you
very much, Clark.

46
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:05,991
Here. Batter up.

47
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,994
Come on, let's hit a few.

48
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,001
Watch out, now.

49
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,003
These will come in pretty fast.

50
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,009
Ha!

51
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,512
You never could
hit a curve ball.

52
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:28,013
Ha ha ha!

53
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:31,016
That's my final decision
about the place.

54
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,520
I'm going to hold out
for a real farmer.

55
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,021
You are?

56
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:40,026
You're just as obstinate
as your father was, too.

57
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,528
I'm sorry.
That's just how It is.

58
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,530
You be careful
when you get back

59
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:45,532
to metropolis, Clark.

60
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,033
It's a long, long way

61
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,035
from where you were born.

62
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:50,537
Yes, Sir.

63
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,039
I never forget that, Sir.

64
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,041
Bye.

65
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,043
Bye, Clark!

66
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:19,231
What Is that god-awful
noise you're making?

67
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:22,735
Mozart, my low-forehead friend.

68
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:25,237
Even this wretched pit
can't diminish

69
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,740
the spirit of true genius.

70
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:31,243
Life itself started
In a murky pit much like this.

71
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:35,748
A true genius like myself
learns to seize the moment.

72
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:38,250
You're the first to know

73
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:42,255
that I now have plans
to recreate life itself.

74
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,758
Hey, Luthor, you better
start breakin' a sweat,

75
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,259
or we'll throw you
to the wolves!

76
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,262
Let's get them duds dirty!

77
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:50,263
Move it, meathead.

78
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,264
Let's see a little sweat.

79
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,266
What's that car doing out here?

80
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,268
?? she ain't fakin'??

81
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,770
?? whole lotta shakin'
goin' on...

82
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:59,773
hey, stop! Hold It there, son!

83
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:03,776
Yo, dudes,
where the hell Is this,

84
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,778
and how the hell
do I get to cedar city?

85
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,281
You're on the wrong
side of the state, boy!

86
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:11,283
No chance. Oh, no.

87
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:15,287
Ooh, you got a fine, fine,

88
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,790
super-fine sound system
here, son.

89
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,292
I guess you dudes
have never seen

90
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,295
one of these sensurround
100s, have you?

91
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,297
I seen one In a magazine.

92
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,800
Come on, get in.

93
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,301
Really?

94
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:30,303
Really?

95
00:11:30,804 --> 00:11:32,304
Only way to hear it. Come on.

96
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,305
All right!

97
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:35,809
Hop in, bubba.
Let's give It a listen.

98
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,813
Hey, this Is groovy.

99
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:43,817
Doors.

100
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:46,318
What's going on?

101
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,319
Windows.

102
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,822
Whoa!

103
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:50,824
The top.

104
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:52,324
Seats.

105
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,327
Whoa! All right!

106
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,328
All right!

107
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,832
Drive away.

108
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,336
Y'all come back
and see us now, hear?

109
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:07,340
Launch.

110
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:10,342
Whoa-oh-oh!

111
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,343
Boom.

112
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,847
All right!

113
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,350
Did I do ok or what, uncle Lex?

114
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:19,352
Lenny, I've always
considered you

115
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:21,353
the Dutch elm disease
In my family tree,

116
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,356
but this time, nephew,
you did fine.

117
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,863
You skipping the country?

118
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:32,365
You pathetic product
of public schools,

119
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:35,367
I've had nothing
on my awesome mind

120
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:38,370
since incarceration
except one thing...

121
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:39,872
destroy Superman.

122
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:41,291
Rock!

123
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:46,880
Sorry.

124
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:52,384
Bonjour, monsieur.

125
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,387
Comment a va aujourd'hui?

126
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,897
Clark!

127
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,400
Oh.

128
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,410
Pardon, monsieur.

129
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:20,412
Ou est la gare pour...

130
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,915
the metropolitan station?

131
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,417
Arghh!

132
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,430
Help!

133
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,432
Help!

134
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:42,936
Help! Somebody get help!

135
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,452
Superman!

136
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:25,478
He'll be all right.
I think he needs a doctor.

137
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:27,980
Superman!

138
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,983
Gentlemen, one moment.

139
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,983
I'd like all the people
back there to know

140
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,486
that our subway system
Is still the safest

141
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,989
and most reliable means
of public transportation.

142
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,490
Thank you.

143
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,496
Thanks.

144
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:46,624
You're late, Kent!

145
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,626
Sorry. Won't happen again.

146
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:50,127
Ha!

147
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:52,129
Where Is everybody?

148
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,131
Boring.

149
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,635
Tedious.

150
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:00,137
Abominable!

151
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:01,138
Regardez.

152
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,140
Voila, monsieur David Warfield.

153
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,143
That tycoon who owns
those sleazy tabloids?

154
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:07,645
Au contraire, mon ami.

155
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,647
He owns those sleazy tabloids

156
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,649
and the daily planet.

157
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,151
Tedious.

158
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,153
Don't tell me
you only read pictures.

159
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:19,657
The fact is, Mr. White,
that I only read the ledger,

160
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:22,660
a ledger which
the previous owners

161
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:24,161
paid so little attention to,

162
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,164
I bought the paper
out from under them.

163
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:29,667
It hasn't made any money
In three years!

164
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:32,170
And the name of the game
Is making money.

165
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:35,673
Ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter,

166
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,174
Lacy Warfield.

167
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,175
Thanks, daddy.

168
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,177
It's very nice
to meet you, Ma'am.

169
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:43,681
Mr. White,
Lacy will be helping you.

170
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:46,183
Helping me? Helping me what?

171
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,185
I have some mock copies

172
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:51,188
of our new layout.
Super, isn't it?

173
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,691
The suit's not right,
but we'll change it.

174
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,693
Excuse me, Mr. Warfield,

175
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:57,695
but the world Isn't
really on the brink.

176
00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:00,197
Isn't that headline
Irresponsible?

177
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,701
Maybe, but It'll sell
a lot of newspapers.

178
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:06,203
Don't do anything rash.

179
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:09,206
I won't let you turn
this grand old lady

180
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,208
into one of your bimbos!

181
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,209
Mr. White.

182
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,712
May I point out that daddy
holds all your contracts,

183
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:17,215
which you will have to honour.

184
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:20,217
Excusez-moi...
your spoiledness.

185
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,720
Why Is Lois trying
to speak French?

186
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,221
I'm flying to Paris

187
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:26,725
for the emergency
ministers conference...

188
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:30,227
not so fast.
All trips are cancelled.

189
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:33,230
My trip to Paris is cancelled?

190
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,733
Mr. White, show me your books.

191
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,736
Everybody else,
get back to work.

192
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:40,738
We're being treated unfairly.

193
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,740
I'll speak to Miss Warfield.

194
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:42,740
Me, too.

195
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:43,742
Excuse me, Miss Warfield?

196
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:44,742
Yes?

197
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,744
I think I speak for
all of us when I say

198
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,746
that we'll all do
our best to cooperate.

199
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,247
Thank you.

200
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:51,749
But a reporter's
first allegiance.

201
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,251
Is to the truth.

202
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:56,253
This city's people
depend on us.

203
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,255
We can't let them down.

204
00:16:58,256 --> 00:16:59,758
Thank you.

205
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:06,263
Is he for real?

206
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:10,267
100%, and I like
him that way, ok?

207
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,770
You have a thing for him?

208
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,272
For Clark? No! Ha ha ha!

209
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,274
He's kind of cute.

210
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,777
Uh, look, Miss Warfield...

211
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:23,280
Clark Is the oldest
living boy scout, ok?

212
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:25,783
He's trustworthy, he's helpful,

213
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,785
he's loyal, he's obedient,

214
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,286
he...

215
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,289
I don't know how
to tell you this.

216
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,794
I just don't think he'd be
attracted to somebody like you.

217
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:39,296
Don't be silly.
All men like me.

218
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:41,299
I'm very, very rich.

219
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,718
Why don't you have
air travel expenses?

220
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,720
I usually get air sick,

221
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,722
especially when It's bumpy.

222
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:51,226
Lois, get In here!

223
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,730
Lois, explain this
column of figures.

224
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,732
Chief, the president's
coming on live.

225
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,234
Oh, he is? oh.

226
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:02,236
I doubt it's good news.

227
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,239
It won't be that terrible.

228
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:06,740
Hopefully,
very terrible, Miss lane.

229
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,742
We could double our circulation

230
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:11,245
with a good
International crisis.

231
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:13,747
And because
the summit has failed,

232
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:15,750
we have no choice

233
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:18,753
but to strive
to be second to none.

234
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:20,755
In the nuclear arms race.

235
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:25,260
Therefore, I am announcing
the following measures...

236
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:31,765
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

237
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:35,769
The best thing we can do
Is think positively.

238
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,273
Now, Is there
anything we can do?

239
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:41,276
Doesn't anyone
have a suggestion?

240
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:44,278
All right.

241
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,281
I'll make a suggestion.

242
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:49,284
Let's write our congressmen.

243
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:51,285
That'll do a lot of good.

244
00:18:51,286 --> 00:18:55,289
Somebody has to be an optimist.

245
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,791
Jeremy?

246
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:01,295
What can we do
about the crisis?

247
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:02,797
He doesn't know
what's happening.

248
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,802
I'd write a letter to someone
that would do some good.

249
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:09,304
Who, Santa Claus?

250
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,805
No! Superman!

251
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:14,308
Superman, the subject
of our newest exhibit,

252
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,312
has graciously donated a strand
of his hair to the museum,

253
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:20,815
so we can see how strong
he really is.

254
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:23,818
Here you can see
a 1,000-pound load

255
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,820
easily suspended
by his single hair.

256
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,323
The museum will
be closing soon,

257
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:31,326
so we should hurry a little.

258
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:35,330
You know what
I can do with that hair?

259
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,833
You can make
a toupee that flies.

260
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,334
That hair Is a sample

261
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:42,337
of Superman's genetic material,

262
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:44,840
the building blocks
of his body.

263
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,343
With enough nuclear power
to mutate the genes,

264
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:53,348
I can create a being who's
more powerful than him,

265
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,852
who has total allegiance to me.

266
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,862
You better stand back.

267
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,364
Keep your eye out.

268
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,811
You wanted to see me?

269
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:43,814
Yeah, hi, Clark.
Please, come in.

270
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:46,817
I've come up with
a brilliant idea.

271
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,319
Oh... really?

272
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,321
Well, daddy thinks
It's brilliant.

273
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,323
You'll write this new series

274
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,325
called metropolis after hours.

275
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:56,327
Who, me? I...

276
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:58,329
It's wonderful.

277
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,331
It's great, Isn't it?

278
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:02,333
I'm not right for this.

279
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,335
You're perfect for it.

280
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:05,336
You're young,

281
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:07,338
you're single,
you're successful.

282
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,840
I'm usually In bed by 10:30.

283
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:12,343
That's just it.
You don't flaunt it.

284
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:14,845
You're no slave
to fashion, although...

285
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:16,848
have you considered
using contacts?

286
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,850
Uh, they, uh,
make my eyes itch.

287
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:23,854
Listen, I thought we
could do this together.

288
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:26,357
I know all the right places.

289
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:28,859
I belong to the right clubs.

290
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,862
We'll start tonight
at the metro club.

291
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:32,363
Oh, tonight?

292
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:33,864
Yeah. It's a date.

293
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,366
A date?

294
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:36,367
A date?

295
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:38,869
Uh, well, It's just
business, actually.

296
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,873
I've got a letter
for Superman, care of me.

297
00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:44,875
Superman gets mail here?

298
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,378
It's probably just
a picture request.

299
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,380
I could look after
It for you, Lois.

300
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,881
I think It's more
than a fan letter.

301
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,883
I think you should read it.

302
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:56,387
"Dear Superman,
my teacher Is speaking

303
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:58,389
"about the president's
speech on the arms race.

304
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,893
"We're all
very unhappy about it,

305
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:05,397
"and I said
we should get Superman

306
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:07,398
"to rid the world
of nuclear arms

307
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:10,902
because only he could do it."

308
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:15,906
"everybody thinks
I'm a space cadet.

309
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,407
"Once you've destroyed
all nuclear missiles,

310
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:18,408
"they'll see I was right.

311
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:19,411
"Superman can make sure

312
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:20,912
"we don't blow ourselves up.

313
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,914
"Thanks a lot. I know
you'll come through.

314
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:25,916
Your friend, Jeremy."

315
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:26,917
poor kid.

316
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:29,420
I'll get back to work.

317
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:31,422
There's an angle In this.

318
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:33,424
An angle? He's just a kid!

319
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:35,426
Daddy loves whipping
up campaigns,

320
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:37,428
and the public loves it!

321
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:39,430
Lacy!

322
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:41,432
We're going to make
this kid a celebrity.

323
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,434
Everybody In the world
will wonder

324
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:45,937
what Superman's reply is.

325
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:51,442
Welcome to metropolis, Jeremy.

326
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:52,944
I'm Mr. Warfield,

327
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:54,946
and this is my daughter Lacy.

328
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:55,947
Hi, Jeremy.

329
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:57,947
Now come along
and meet the press.

330
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:58,950
Have a good trip?

331
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:00,452
Car had a flat.

332
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:01,952
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

333
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:05,456
Here, let everybody
get a picture of you.

334
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,456
That's it, everyone.

335
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:07,459
Jeremy, over here.

336
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,959
What a boy!

337
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,961
Now, come along,

338
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:13,465
and tell the American public
what you told me.

339
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,967
I said I wish Superman
would've said yes!

340
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:17,969
Did you get that?

341
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,969
No, we didn't.

342
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,971
Say It again...

343
00:23:20,472 --> 00:23:21,472
loudly.

344
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:24,976
I said I wish Superman
would've said yes.

345
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:34,985
Miss lane. Miss lane.

346
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,487
Take a look at this.

347
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,489
Hot off the press.

348
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,990
Oh, my god!

349
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,493
This time, he's gone too far.

350
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:44,495
Look, Clark.

351
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,497
Can't wait for
the chief's reaction.

352
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm through
taking It lying down!

353
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,002
Anybody wants me,
I'll be downtown!

354
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:54,505
Chief look different to you?

355
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:58,509
He looks like my father
asking for a loan.

356
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,011
I'll make sure he's all right.

357
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,012
Look, Clark,

358
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:04,515
there's nothing
we can do about it.

359
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:06,517
It's Superman's decision now.

360
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm sure he'll do
the right thing.

361
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:51,062
May the elders
watch over you, my son.

362
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:56,066
Their wisdom
Is all that Is left

363
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:59,070
of a once powerful
and enlightened planet.

364
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:04,075
You must listen to them, Kalel.

365
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:07,579
Listen.

366
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,585
I know I'm forbidden
to interfere,

367
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,087
and yet the earth is threatened

368
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:19,590
by the same fate as krypton's.

369
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:22,593
The earth Is too primitive.

370
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:24,595
You can flee to new worlds

371
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:27,098
where war is long forgotten.

372
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,100
If you teach the earth

373
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:32,102
to put its fate In any one man,

374
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,605
even yourself,

375
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:36,608
you're teaching them
to be betrayed.

376
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:40,612
Betrayed.

377
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:42,113
Betrayed.

378
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:43,615
Betrayed!

379
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:45,575
Betrayed!

380
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:50,664
And because
the summit has failed,

381
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:52,666
we have no choice

382
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:56,670
but to strive
to be second to none.

383
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,673
In the nuclear arms race.

384
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,675
To that end,

385
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:05,178
this administration
has pursued,

386
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,681
and will continue to pursue...

387
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:12,686
therefore...

388
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,691
just a minute.

389
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:22,195
Lois.

390
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,197
There you are! What happened?

391
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:26,199
What do you mean?

392
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,202
"Meet me at 6:00 for
the press awards."

393
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:30,704
Wear something really nice

394
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:32,205
"and don't be late."

395
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:34,708
were we discussing
some other Lois?

396
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,710
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

397
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,212
Ok, get dressed, and we'll go.

398
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:42,215
I'd rather not,
If you don't mind.

399
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,217
I've got thinking to do,

400
00:26:44,718 --> 00:26:46,720
but you go ahead, ok?

401
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:50,222
Clark...

402
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:53,226
something's wrong, isn't it?

403
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,228
Hmm?

404
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:58,732
Is there anything I can do?

405
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:01,234
Yes, as a matter of fact.

406
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:04,237
Could we get some fresh air?

407
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,240
Fresh air?

408
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,242
Fresh air.

409
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:12,745
Fresh air! Sure!
Sure, Clark. Sure.

410
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:14,747
Who needs rubber chicken
and speeches anyway?

411
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:17,750
Come on, let's get
some fresh air.

412
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,752
Breathe really deep.

413
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:22,755
Breathe. Do you feel better?

414
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,758
Clark? Clark! Clark!
Things aren't that bad!

415
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,761
Clark, stop! Oh, Clark!

416
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:30,764
Clark! Clark!

417
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:41,775
Superman!

418
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:02,795
You ok?

419
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:03,797
Great.

420
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:16,810
Hey, look at that.

421
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,823
Ready? There you go! Bye-bye!

422
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,353
How'd you like going solo?

423
00:29:01,354 --> 00:29:02,855
I loved it...

424
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,858
but not as much
as being with you.

425
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:08,861
I needed to be with you, too.

426
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:10,864
You make me laugh.

427
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:15,367
You're the only one
I can talk to.

428
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:19,371
Sometimes, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

429
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:21,874
I'm always here for you.

430
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,375
You know that.

431
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,377
You'll do the right thing,

432
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:27,379
no matter what It is.

433
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,881
You always have.

434
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:30,382
Thank you.

435
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:32,384
You know something?

436
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:33,385
What?

437
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:35,888
You don't even know my name.

438
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,390
Kalel.

439
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:41,394
You remember, don't you?

440
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,396
I remember everything.

441
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:47,900
"Never set one of them
above the rest.

442
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,903
Love all humanity Instead."

443
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:54,407
that's not fair.

444
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:21,934
Lois.

445
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:24,937
Time to go. We'll be late.

446
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:26,438
Huh?

447
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:30,943
What am I doing out here
freezing my butt off?

448
00:30:30,944 --> 00:30:33,946
Oh, you wanted some fresh air.

449
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:34,947
That's ok.

450
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:37,449
I don't want to catch a cold.

451
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,451
I feel kind of weird.

452
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:42,955
I feel like I have jet lag.

453
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:43,956
Jeepers.

454
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:45,457
Isn't that crazy?

455
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,458
Yeah.

456
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,961
How about you? You still down?

457
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:50,963
Nope. Things are pretty clear.

458
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:54,968
Good. Too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

459
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,472
Clark, you got to
go with your gut.

460
00:31:00,473 --> 00:31:01,473
Mmm.

461
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,976
Come on.

462
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,774
Ok, here you go, Jeremy.

463
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:12,277
Mr. Warfield wants shots of you

464
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,279
with lots of local colour.

465
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:16,780
I can't find anything special.

466
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:17,782
Hi, Jeremy.

467
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:19,783
Superman!

468
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:20,785
Jimmy.

469
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:22,786
What a scoop!

470
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,789
Want to take a walk with me?

471
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,791
Sure! ok!

472
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,294
Jimmy, come on.

473
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:44,309
You can't! You'll get towed!

474
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,811
Do you know what
a ticket costs here?

475
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:49,814
Lacy, It's only money!

476
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:00,826
Wait for me upstairs
In the gallery.

477
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:02,327
Sure. ok.

478
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:03,829
Good luck, Superman.

479
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:05,831
Thanks.

480
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:16,341
I saved you a seat.

481
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:18,844
Yay!

482
00:32:20,846 --> 00:32:22,347
All right, Superman!

483
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:26,350
Madame secretary, I don't
represent any country,

484
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:28,853
but I'd like
to address the delegates.

485
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:32,858
In that case,
you will need a sponsor.

486
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,861
I believe that will do.

487
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:37,863
Please.

488
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,368
Thank you.

489
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,871
What's he going to say?

490
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:49,373
Something wonderful.

491
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:51,375
Madam secretary,

492
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:53,878
honourable delegates,

493
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:55,881
ladies and gentlemen.

494
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:57,882
For many years now,

495
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:00,885
I've lived among you
as a visitor.

496
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:03,387
I've seen the beauty
of your many cultures.

497
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:07,892
I've felt great joy In your
magnificent accomplishments.

498
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:11,395
I've also seen
the folly of your wars.

499
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:13,397
As of today, I'm not
a visitor anymore

500
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:18,402
because the earth
Is my home, too.

501
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:19,404
We can't live In fear.

502
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:23,407
I can't stand idly by
and watch us

503
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:26,912
stumble into the madness
of possible nuclear destruction.

504
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:29,413
And so,
I've come to a decision.

505
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:33,417
I'll do what our governments
haven't done.

506
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:34,919
Effective immediately,

507
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,422
I'll rid our planet
of all nuclear weapons.

508
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:40,424
Yay! Yay!

509
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:43,428
Yay, Superman.

510
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,432
Way to go, Superman!

511
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:54,940
Superman!

512
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:06,659
Missile test alpha.
All systems go.

513
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,663
4, 3, 2, 1.

514
00:35:58,897 --> 00:35:59,897
Oh! Hello!

515
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,900
Nice to see you guys!

516
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:06,904
Why don't you just relax there?

517
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:09,406
I'll get on with
the introductions.

518
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:10,908
Dixie...

519
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,410
and Trixie.

520
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:18,916
From the land of the free
and the great cost overrun,

521
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:20,918
Harry howler,
nuclear strategist

522
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,921
from America's top think tank

523
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:25,923
and a great warmonger
In his own right.

524
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:28,426
A hearty bienvenue
to jean Pierre Dubois,

525
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:31,930
nuclear warhead dealer
to the world.

526
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,430
His motto is,

527
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:36,433
"if you didn't
buy It from jean Pierre,

528
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:39,937
you didn't buy it
on ze black market."

529
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:41,438
general Romoff.

530
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:45,943
A lot of people think of you
as the mad Russian.

531
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:50,447
I like to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

532
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:51,950
Please, be seated.

533
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:56,954
I know you guys
are overcome with joy

534
00:36:56,955 --> 00:37:00,958
now that Superman
has ended the arms race,

535
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:03,961
but If we work together,

536
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:06,463
we can make the world safe...

537
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:07,965
for war profits.

538
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:09,466
Make your point.

539
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:10,968
I, Lex Luthor,

540
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,971
the greatest criminal mind
of the modern era,

541
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:15,473
have discovered a way
to destroy Superman.

542
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:18,977
Behold,
my unscrupulous friends.

543
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:22,980
Shut those blinds!

544
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:25,482
The sun is hurting my eyes!

545
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:28,486
Exactly.
You know what the sun is?

546
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:30,488
It's a huge nuclear bomb

547
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,990
with so much radiation In it,

548
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:35,993
It could incinerate
the average man like that!

549
00:37:35,994 --> 00:37:39,997
Yes, but Superman
Is no average man.

550
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:41,500
Aha! Right.

551
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,502
What Is your plan?

552
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:49,006
Boys, old Lex here has
kind of a secret recipe,

553
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:53,010
a genetic stew
In this dish, If you will.

554
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:57,014
If you'll put this
on one of your missiles,

555
00:37:57,015 --> 00:38:01,560
Superman will have the biggest
surprise of his life.

556
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:04,564
I'll introduce him
to his first nightmare...

557
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:06,565
a nuclear man.

558
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:07,567
He'll pierce his skin.

559
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:10,027
He'll make him mortal.
He'll become sick.

560
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:13,030
We'll dance on his grave.

561
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:17,034
Why should we deal
with a scoundrel like you?

562
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:18,577
Remember my motto,

563
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:21,039
"the more fear you make,
the more loot you take,"

564
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,582
and the more missiles
you guys sell.

565
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:27,587
Yes, but what's In It for you?

566
00:38:29,047 --> 00:38:31,049
A tiny commission.

567
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,052
Something appropriate.

568
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:37,054
A number...

569
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:40,058
with a lot of zeros behind it.

570
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:48,607
Lenny.

571
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:50,610
The new genetic material.

572
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:55,072
And now, Leonard...

573
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:57,616
your uncle Lex,
with this protoplasm

574
00:38:57,617 --> 00:39:01,621
that I've grown from
Superman's hair cells...

575
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:06,126
will duplicate creation itself.

576
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:07,627
Ow.

577
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,629
Now the fabric.

578
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:14,634
Uncle Lex, this ain't
gonna cover him.

579
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:20,139
The computer inside will
weave enough material

580
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,142
to maintain
the high moral standards

581
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:26,145
that I've always subscribed to.

582
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:28,647
You know what
this means, uncle Lex?

583
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,149
What?

584
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,652
We're going to be parents!

585
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:04,517
What's your name, sergeant?

586
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:06,018
York, Sir!

587
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:08,021
At ease.

588
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:41,053
Launch control. Yes, Sir?

589
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:42,555
Yes, Sir.

590
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:46,559
There's a weather problem.
We got a hold.

591
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Hold?

592
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,562
What's your name, son?

593
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:50,563
Gorham.

594
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:51,564
Gorham, Sir.

595
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:52,565
Gorham, Sir.

596
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:54,567
You know your code book?

597
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:56,068
Of course, Sir.

598
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:58,571
It's a 2706,
Inclement override.

599
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:00,573
On my command, fire.

600
00:41:00,574 --> 00:41:03,076
Yes, Sir. Standby to launch.

601
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:07,080
10, 9...

602
00:41:19,593 --> 00:41:21,094
Missed us.

603
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,382
Reach out!

604
00:42:41,383 --> 00:42:42,884
Come on!

605
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,386
Down!

606
00:42:45,387 --> 00:42:47,388
Reach out!

607
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:49,390
And stretch!

608
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:50,891
Down!

609
00:42:50,892 --> 00:42:52,393
Up!

610
00:42:52,394 --> 00:42:53,395
Oww! Ahh!

611
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:54,896
Clark, are you ok?

612
00:42:54,897 --> 00:42:56,397
I'll sit this one out.

613
00:42:56,398 --> 00:42:57,898
Oh, are you sure?

614
00:42:57,899 --> 00:43:00,901
But It's great for your series.

615
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:02,903
Let's try It again.
Come on, let's start.

616
00:43:02,904 --> 00:43:04,405
2...

617
00:43:04,406 --> 00:43:06,407
3, 4... 3, 4...

618
00:43:06,408 --> 00:43:08,409
1, 2, 3...

619
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,411
I don't think so.

620
00:43:10,412 --> 00:43:12,414
Clark, are you ok?

621
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:22,423
48.

622
00:43:22,424 --> 00:43:23,924
49.

623
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:25,926
23...done.

624
00:43:25,927 --> 00:43:27,928
Ok, you try It now.

625
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:28,929
Ok.

626
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,933
Let's set it
a little higher for you.

627
00:43:32,934 --> 00:43:34,936
Just push down.

628
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:38,939
Are you ok?

629
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,441
Need some help?

630
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:41,942
Just step down.

631
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:43,444
Thank you.

632
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:46,447
Your friend doesn't
know his own strength.

633
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:48,449
Clark, this Is Paul.

634
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:50,451
He's a trainer here.

635
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:53,454
I got just the thing for you.

636
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:54,955
Over here, Clarkey.

637
00:43:54,956 --> 00:43:56,458
Clarkey?

638
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:02,463
It's nice of him
to help me out.

639
00:44:02,464 --> 00:44:04,466
Here, try this one.

640
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:06,467
Oh, Clark, are you ok?

641
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:07,468
Yeah.

642
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:08,469
Sorry.

643
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,472
No pain, no gain.

644
00:44:12,474 --> 00:44:14,475
Jeez, what a jerk.

645
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:16,477
I never realized It before.

646
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:20,481
I guess a lot of
people I know are jerks.

647
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:23,984
Maybe you think I'm one,
so you avoid me.

648
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:25,986
No, I don't think that.

649
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:28,989
I've just been really
busy, that's all.

650
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,993
You know Lois Is doing
that interview with Superman

651
00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:34,995
about his peace Mission?

652
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:38,999
Maybe the four of us
could meet for high tea.

653
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,001
It's very chic.

654
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:42,504
Could you hand me
those weights, Clark?

655
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:44,004
Uh, excuse me.

656
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:46,006
Wait a minute, Lacy.

657
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,007
Come early.

658
00:44:47,008 --> 00:44:49,009
The view Is so romantic
from my balcony.

659
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,011
See ya.

660
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:53,515
Oh, sure. Here.

661
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:56,016
Not those! The other one!

662
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:58,436
Uh... no pain, no gain?

663
00:45:08,488 --> 00:45:10,490
What was that?

664
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:15,495
Uncle Lex,
you're spooking me out.

665
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:20,000
There.

666
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,002
Madam...

667
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:24,504
thank you very much.

668
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:26,506
Oui, monsieur. Au revoir.

669
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,508
Au revoir.

670
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,530
I'm incredible.

671
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:56,035
Uncle Lex, he's like...

672
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,538
he's beautiful. He's perfect.

673
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,541
Welcome home, nuclear man.

674
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:05,045
Your father's happy to see you.

675
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,064
The sun has given him
Internally generated heat.

676
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,567
I'm, uh...

677
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,569
you are...

678
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,074
I'm... what? I'm a genius?

679
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:37,077
I'm incredible! I'm...

680
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:40,079
you are nothing!

681
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,081
I am the father now.

682
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:43,083
You have my voice.

683
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,585
No, you have my voice.

684
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,088
Just remember, I made you.

685
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:51,591
You're just
an experiment, freako.

686
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:55,595
What's that?

687
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:57,097
Oh, no.

688
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,098
I'm an experiment?

689
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,599
I'm freako?

690
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,602
I was just kidding!

691
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:06,606
If anyone's freako here,
It's got to be me!

692
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:08,607
Oh, wow!

693
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:12,111
Oh, wow!
I'm break dancing! Hey!

694
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:15,115
This rocks! Hey! Oh! Whoa...

695
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:18,617
I made you. I can destroy you.

696
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,120
Destroy.

697
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,122
Destroy Superman now.

698
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:26,626
You sweet thing!
But not quite yet.

699
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:28,128
Come here.

700
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:31,631
We'll discuss
when the proper time is.

701
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:40,140
Uncle Lex.

702
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,647
Oh, no!

703
00:47:48,148 --> 00:47:50,650
He's, like... he's, like, cold.

704
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,652
Of course he is.

705
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:54,654
That's his vulnerability.

706
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:57,156
That's the only way
he can be stopped.

707
00:47:57,157 --> 00:47:59,159
What?

708
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:02,161
Lenny, my loud-mouth nephew,

709
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:04,163
he gets his energy
from the sun.

710
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:07,166
Without it, he's
like you at night...

711
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,168
useless.

712
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,142
Nobody's perfect.

713
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:31,858
You know, I never had
a double date before.

714
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:35,361
This Is fun. How do I look?

715
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:36,862
Illegal...

716
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,866
like the last six
dresses you tried on.

717
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:41,867
Uh, listen, Lacy,

718
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:44,370
I don't want
to burst your bubble,

719
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:47,373
but Clark won't notice
what you're wearing.

720
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:48,874
Yes, he will.

721
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,376
Oh, there's Clark.

722
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,378
You look great.

723
00:48:52,379 --> 00:48:54,380
Oh, maybe It's just Superman.

724
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:55,881
No.

725
00:48:55,882 --> 00:48:59,386
No, Superman makes
a different kind of entrance.

726
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:11,897
Hi, Lacy.

727
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:12,898
Hi, Clark.

728
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:13,900
Could you break a 20?

729
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:15,901
Driver didn't have any change.

730
00:49:15,902 --> 00:49:18,404
Yeah, sure.
Let me get my purse.

731
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:19,905
Hi, Lois.

732
00:49:19,906 --> 00:49:21,407
Hi, Clark.

733
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,909
You won't believe
these questions.

734
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,912
Mr. Warfield gave me
to ask Superman.

735
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:31,417
"Are you part of a plot to
weaken our national defence?"

736
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:33,419
It's his grey matter
that's weakened.

737
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,422
How can I ask Superman
these questions?

738
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:38,424
Uh, well, politely, I guess.

739
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:41,427
Let's see, I have $18 and...

740
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:43,929
Clark, she really likes you,

741
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,432
so notice the dress.

742
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:47,933
My American express card.

743
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:48,934
Dress.

744
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:50,936
Oh, hey! Neat dress!

745
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:52,939
Thanks. Be right back.

746
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:57,944
Hey, what's that?

747
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:02,449
Now, there's a different
kind of entrance.

748
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:07,453
Hi, Lois.

749
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,455
Hello, Superman.

750
00:50:08,456 --> 00:50:09,455
How are you?

751
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:11,457
I'm fine.

752
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:15,461
Oh! Um, Superman,
meet Lacy Warfield.

753
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:16,463
She's the boss' daughter.

754
00:50:16,464 --> 00:50:17,963
How do you do?

755
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:19,965
That's a very
attractive outfit.

756
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:22,968
I think we better
start our interview.

757
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,470
Two's company.

758
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:27,973
Oh, right! Yeah!
I'll go get Clark.

759
00:50:27,974 --> 00:50:31,977
He's probably helping
the cab driver change a flat

760
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:34,981
or some other good deed.

761
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:37,483
Something smells wonderful.

762
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:38,984
Oh, thank you.

763
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:41,487
I'm cooking some
scallops and duck.

764
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:44,490
In this wonderful
mushroom sauce with champagne,

765
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:47,493
In case we got
hungry afterwards.

766
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:49,996
Uh... I mean, later.

767
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:54,501
You shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble.

768
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:02,508
Should we get on
with the interview?

769
00:51:02,509 --> 00:51:05,511
Yes, let's get on with it.

770
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,513
Um...

771
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:09,014
um...

772
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:11,016
have... have you had
any trouble

773
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:13,519
confiscating the missiles?

774
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,521
There always was
the possibility

775
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:16,523
that some warped individuals

776
00:51:16,524 --> 00:51:18,524
would take advantage

777
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:21,027
of the world's good will, but...

778
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:24,030
Is there something wrong?

779
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,035
Oh, my dinner!

780
00:51:30,036 --> 00:51:32,038
Um, I'll be right back!

781
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:48,053
Hi.

782
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:50,055
I Missed you, Clark.

783
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:53,559
It's so boring up there
with Lois and Superman.

784
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,561
Let's go do something wild.

785
00:51:55,562 --> 00:51:57,563
That wouldn't be polite.

786
00:51:57,564 --> 00:51:59,064
Yeah, you're right.

787
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:02,067
How can one man be so square

788
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:05,070
and so delicious?

789
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:06,572
All right. Let's go.

790
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:07,574
If I have to face Superman,

791
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:08,574
so do you.

792
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,578
Oomph! Uh... Lacy.

793
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,080
Oh, Clark.

794
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:18,084
Uh... uh... stop.

795
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:38,103
I don't believe it!

796
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:41,106
I've never had a duck
turn out so perfectly!

797
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:42,108
I'm out here, Lois.

798
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:45,111
Oh.

799
00:52:56,623 --> 00:52:58,124
Isn't It beautiful?

800
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,626
The city's beautiful.

801
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:03,129
The whole world Is beautiful.

802
00:53:05,131 --> 00:53:08,635
I've always felt moments
like this should be shared

803
00:53:09,135 --> 00:53:12,138
with someone you
care a lot about.

804
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:16,643
Isn't that the doorbell?

805
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:18,645
Yes.

806
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:36,663
Lacy.

807
00:53:38,165 --> 00:53:39,166
Where's Clark?

808
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:40,667
Well, the elevator...

809
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:43,170
never mind. It's a long story.

810
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,173
It always is with Clark.

811
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:49,676
Oh, great, that's him!

812
00:53:51,178 --> 00:53:52,179
Clark?

813
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:55,182
Hi. Those bellboys should
look where they're going.

814
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:56,683
Superman?

815
00:53:57,184 --> 00:53:58,185
Superman?

816
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:00,687
Is dinner ready? Can we eat?

817
00:54:01,188 --> 00:54:02,689
Yeah. Let's go sit down.

818
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,691
Oh, great.

819
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:08,695
Ohh! Sorry! Oh, dear.

820
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:10,697
Oh, no, that's ok.

821
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:12,699
Just leave it there, Clark.

822
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,202
Let me just get a rag.

823
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:17,037
Be right back.

824
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,125
Where's Clark?

825
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,129
?? hello, dolly??

826
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,632
?? hello, dolly??

827
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:32,636
?? It's so nice to have
me back where I belong??

828
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,639
Don't be concerned, blue boy.

829
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,140
Only you can hear me.

830
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,141
It's my own private frequency.

831
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,643
You might call this Lex TV.

832
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,647
Look to your left,
tall, dark, and handsome.

833
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,650
I'll blow 20 stories
off that building...

834
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,154
give or take
a floor or two. Peace.

835
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:53,656
Men.

836
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,659
I hope Clark's ok.
I better look.

837
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,661
Ok.

838
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,664
I'm sorry.

839
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,165
An emergency's come up.

840
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,167
My apologies to Miss Warfield.

841
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,669
Oh, but...

842
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,671
Superman!

843
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,172
Take me with you!

844
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:12,174
I could cover the story!

845
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,177
Have you seen Clark? Huh?

846
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,186
Guess who.

847
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,690
It's your old friend Lex.

848
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,192
If you'd planted a bomb,

849
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:33,195
you'd be miles
from here by now.

850
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,198
This Is my nephew Lenny.

851
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,700
He worships me.

852
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,702
The dude of steel.

853
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,204
Boy, are you gonna get it!

854
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:45,708
Silly me, thinking
I could fool the super guy.

855
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:49,211
You're right. No bomb.

856
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,213
It's just
that you're so involved.

857
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,215
In this world peace bit,

858
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,218
you don't have time
for social calls.

859
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,720
I confess.

860
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,721
I tricked you.

861
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,223
You look great.

862
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,726
Enough small talk.
What are you up to?

863
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,229
You know, you're a workaholic.

864
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,733
You're playing a good guy
24 hours a day.

865
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,736
Why don't you stop
and smell the roses?

866
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,739
Get yourself a pet...
a kitten, a puppy.

867
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,741
You hate children and animals.

868
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,242
Why are you In metropolis?

869
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:24,748
I want to introduce you
to the new kid on the block.

870
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,263
Look closely at
the cell structure.

871
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,265
You see anything familiar?

872
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,269
You've already broken
all the laws of man.

873
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,272
Now you've broken
the laws of nature, too.

874
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,274
You must have hidden a device

875
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,777
on a missile
I hurled into the sun.

876
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:58,280
You know, Mr. muscle,
I'll Miss our chats.

877
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,283
You're the only one
that could keep up with me.

878
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,284
Lenny!

879
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,287
What?

880
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,790
I want to propose a toast.

881
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,792
To a nice guy...

882
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,795
who's about to finish last.

883
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,297
Arrr!

884
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,799
Destroy Superman!

885
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,300
Later.

886
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,303
He's a little bit anxious.

887
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:21,805
Can you blame him?

888
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:25,808
Not one of your great thinkers.

889
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,811
But I, In all modesty, am.

890
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,813
The touching thing
about this plan.

891
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,315
Is you helped me devise it.

892
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:36,318
Prison twisted your mind
Into a delusionary state.

893
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,822
No, no, no. Listen.

894
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,825
I escaped from prison
with one thing on my mind...

895
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:44,326
the end of Superman.

896
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:47,329
So there I was,
the first time ever

897
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,832
that I didn't
have a long-range,

898
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,834
truly devious criminal scheme.

899
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,837
And then I came up with it.

900
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,338
With this guy

901
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,840
and you gone,

902
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,843
I'll make a fortune
rearming the world.

903
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:04,346
You'd risk nuclear war
for your financial gain?

904
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,348
Nobody wants war.

905
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:09,352
I just want to keep
the threat alive.

906
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,356
Nifty, huh?

907
00:58:18,236 --> 00:58:20,322
Good night, sweet prince.

908
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,824
Parting is...

909
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:25,327
inevitable.

910
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,829
Destroy Superman!

911
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,333
First, I have fun.

912
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:52,354
Aah!

913
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:33,895
Aah!

914
00:59:35,397 --> 00:59:36,898
Help me!

915
00:59:45,907 --> 00:59:46,908
Thank you, Superman.

916
01:01:09,991 --> 01:01:11,993
Santa Maria...

917
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,041
oh!

918
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:03,043
Oh!

919
01:02:03,044 --> 01:02:05,046
Un gran miracolo. Grazie.

920
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:25,774
Eeyi! Hah!

921
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,777
Aah!

922
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:51,361
Aah!

923
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,882
Oh!

924
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,405
Arrrgh!

925
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:42,913
Arrrgh!

926
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:57,427
Aah!

927
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:09,940
Yaaa!

928
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:22,994
I said I'd get you

929
01:05:23,495 --> 01:05:26,498
to run one
of our papers yourself,

930
01:05:26,998 --> 01:05:28,500
and I meant it.

931
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,502
Congratulations,
Miss publisher.

932
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:34,505
Thank you, daddy.
That's very nice.

933
01:05:34,506 --> 01:05:36,508
Step into your office.

934
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,511
Where'd this come from?

935
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:42,513
Oh, somebody brought It in.

936
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:44,515
We bought It cheap.

937
01:05:44,516 --> 01:05:48,018
Ok. This time you have
both gone too far.

938
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:51,022
You can print your rag
without Lois lane.

939
01:05:54,526 --> 01:05:57,528
And you certainly have
no right to this.

940
01:05:57,529 --> 01:05:59,530
Lois, I'm sorry.

941
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:01,532
Oh, let her go, darling.

942
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:03,534
I mean, she's useless.

943
01:06:03,535 --> 01:06:06,537
And while you're at it,
fire that Clark Kent.

944
01:06:06,538 --> 01:06:08,539
He hasn't been around
or even telephoned.

945
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,041
I know. I'm worried.

946
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:13,544
Oh, kitten,

947
01:06:13,545 --> 01:06:15,546
didn't we have our little talk

948
01:06:15,547 --> 01:06:17,047
about personal Involvement

949
01:06:17,048 --> 01:06:18,048
with the help?

950
01:06:18,049 --> 01:06:20,051
Now that you're the publisher...

951
01:06:20,552 --> 01:06:21,552
daddy...

952
01:06:21,553 --> 01:06:22,553
yes, darling?

953
01:06:22,554 --> 01:06:23,555
Stuff it!

954
01:06:26,057 --> 01:06:28,058
Lois? Lois, I'm sorry.

955
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:32,063
I promise you I had
nothing to do with that.

956
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:40,071
Have you heard from Clark?

957
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:45,577
No.

958
01:07:09,601 --> 01:07:11,602
Just a minute.

959
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:14,605
Oh, Lois. What are
you doing here?

960
01:07:14,606 --> 01:07:16,607
I knew it.

961
01:07:16,608 --> 01:07:17,608
Oh, I've just,

962
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:19,610
uh... just got
a really bad flu.

963
01:07:19,611 --> 01:07:20,612
What do you mean you knew it?

964
01:07:20,613 --> 01:07:22,113
How'd you know?

965
01:07:24,616 --> 01:07:25,617
You haven't been to work.

966
01:07:25,618 --> 01:07:27,618
You haven't called the office.

967
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:29,120
You haven't even
called me back.

968
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:31,623
How could you not call me back?

969
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,126
Whatever It is,

970
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:38,128
I guess you've
got your reasons,

971
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:42,634
but I knew you
were here, you know?

972
01:07:43,635 --> 01:07:45,135
Somehow...

973
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:47,138
somehow something
pulled me here.

974
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:50,141
I always know when
Superman's In trouble.

975
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:53,145
Ha ha! Superman?
Something's happened to him?

976
01:07:53,645 --> 01:07:55,646
Everybody's saying
he's dead, but...

977
01:07:55,647 --> 01:07:58,649
It can't be true.
I just know it.

978
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,152
I feel It In my heart.

979
01:08:01,153 --> 01:08:03,654
I think he just needs help.

980
01:08:03,655 --> 01:08:07,658
Well, wherever he is, Lois,
I'm sure he'll manage.

981
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:10,661
Well, If he can't...

982
01:08:10,662 --> 01:08:12,663
manage...

983
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:15,166
and he really is... In trouble,

984
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:16,667
then there's, uh...

985
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:20,172
there's a few things
I'd like to tell him.

986
01:08:22,174 --> 01:08:24,175
I'd tell him...

987
01:08:24,176 --> 01:08:27,678
that I will always
cherish the time

988
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,680
we spent together,

989
01:08:29,681 --> 01:08:32,683
and I never expected
anything In return

990
01:08:32,684 --> 01:08:36,687
and no matter how few
minutes I saw him for,

991
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:38,689
It always made me happy.

992
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:43,194
And I would tell him...
that I love him,

993
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:46,697
and that I'll always love him,

994
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:49,201
and that... whatever...

995
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:51,702
happens to the world, I...

996
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:53,704
I know that...

997
01:08:53,705 --> 01:08:58,209
that he's doing his best
to make sure

998
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,711
that It'll be all right
for the rest of us.

999
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:03,214
Well, wherever he is, Lois,

1000
01:09:03,215 --> 01:09:05,216
I know that...

1001
01:09:05,217 --> 01:09:07,719
he would want to thank you.

1002
01:09:13,725 --> 01:09:15,726
Listen, I'm, um...

1003
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:17,229
I'm pretty tired, you know,

1004
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:19,730
so I think I'll just rest here

1005
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:21,232
for a while, ok?

1006
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:24,736
I'll be fine. It's ok.

1007
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:26,238
Please?

1008
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:31,242
Well, I hope you
feel better, Clark.

1009
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:34,246
Thanks.

1010
01:09:40,752 --> 01:09:42,253
Um...

1011
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:45,256
if... if you do see him,

1012
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:48,259
um... or... or... or hear from him,

1013
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,763
he might need this.

1014
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,355
Oh, Lex, we're all very pleased

1015
01:10:01,356 --> 01:10:06,861
at all the nuclear missiles
and arms you've helped us sell,

1016
01:10:06,862 --> 01:10:10,865
and, uh, we've decided
to increase your commission.

1017
01:10:10,866 --> 01:10:14,368
Oh, guys, really, that's great.

1018
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:16,871
It's the least we could do.

1019
01:10:16,872 --> 01:10:18,873
Well, I have another idea.

1020
01:10:18,874 --> 01:10:21,876
Gentlemen, I've decided

1021
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:24,379
to assume control
of the company.

1022
01:10:31,386 --> 01:10:34,890
My first official act
Is to say, "you're fired!"

1023
01:10:36,391 --> 01:10:38,392
you're mad.

1024
01:10:38,393 --> 01:10:41,396
Oh, really? Look at this.

1025
01:10:49,404 --> 01:10:52,406
If you want
a reference for work,

1026
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:54,409
forget it!

1027
01:10:57,412 --> 01:10:59,413
That was a good bit.

1028
01:10:59,414 --> 01:11:01,916
You know, with my brains

1029
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:05,419
and your...
frankly, your brawn,

1030
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,422
the possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

1031
01:11:08,423 --> 01:11:10,925
I could be president,
emperor, king.

1032
01:11:10,926 --> 01:11:13,928
Did you see how scared
those guys were?

1033
01:11:13,929 --> 01:11:16,430
And what do you fear?

1034
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:18,432
What? Now?

1035
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:20,935
With Superman dead,
and you're on my team?

1036
01:11:20,936 --> 01:11:22,937
It's like I'm the coach,

1037
01:11:22,938 --> 01:11:25,439
and you're the best
power forward ever.

1038
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,441
What's to fear?

1039
01:11:39,955 --> 01:11:42,957
All that remains
of krypton's energy.

1040
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,959
Is yours.

1041
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,961
After It Is gone,

1042
01:11:46,962 --> 01:11:50,966
you will belong solely
to your new home.

1043
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:56,470
If our dying planet
can save your life, my son,

1044
01:11:56,471 --> 01:11:59,975
we have not died In vain.

1045
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:47,647
Rrraaarr!

1046
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,167
Where Is the woman?

1047
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:09,168
You'll never find her.

1048
01:13:09,169 --> 01:13:13,173
If you will not tell me,
I will hurt people.

1049
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,680
Rooaarr!

1050
01:13:21,681 --> 01:13:25,185
Yaaaah!

1051
01:13:26,186 --> 01:13:29,189
Rooaarr!

1052
01:13:34,694 --> 01:13:36,696
Stop! Don't do it! The people!

1053
01:13:43,703 --> 01:13:44,704
Aah!

1054
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:50,710
Yaaahh!

1055
01:14:15,235 --> 01:14:16,736
Ohh!

1056
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,751
Easy, now, easy.

1057
01:14:32,752 --> 01:14:34,753
Slow, slow, slow.

1058
01:14:34,754 --> 01:14:36,755
Stop! That's enough!

1059
01:14:36,756 --> 01:14:38,757
That's enough.

1060
01:14:38,758 --> 01:14:40,760
You win. I'll take you to her.

1061
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,691
Raaarrgh!

1062
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:57,694
Yaahh!

1063
01:14:58,195 --> 01:15:00,197
Rooaarr!

1064
01:15:12,209 --> 01:15:14,210
Where Is she?

1065
01:15:14,211 --> 01:15:15,212
Far away from here and safe.

1066
01:15:15,213 --> 01:15:17,714
Don't go In there.
She's not In there.

1067
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:27,224
Ah... aahh...

1068
01:16:51,308 --> 01:16:53,810
errr!

1069
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:04,320
Errrr!

1070
01:17:04,321 --> 01:17:07,324
Raarrr!

1071
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:57,874
Grrrrr!

1072
01:17:58,375 --> 01:17:59,875
Aah!

1073
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:02,379
Uugh!

1074
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:06,383
Aah!

1075
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:27,904
Aaaahhh!

1076
01:18:32,909 --> 01:18:36,412
Aaarrrrgh!

1077
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:39,416
Rrrarrrr!

1078
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:21,081
We've got to tone down
these headlines.

1079
01:19:21,082 --> 01:19:22,583
Tone down our headlines?

1080
01:19:22,584 --> 01:19:25,085
Lacy, that's all
the common man reads.

1081
01:19:25,086 --> 01:19:27,588
We could do with
less sensationalism.

1082
01:19:27,589 --> 01:19:30,091
Less sensational papers
go broke.

1083
01:19:30,592 --> 01:19:32,093
I taught you long ago

1084
01:19:32,594 --> 01:19:35,096
that the business of
newspapers Is business.

1085
01:19:35,597 --> 01:19:36,097
No, daddy.

1086
01:19:36,598 --> 01:19:37,599
Our business Is journalism.

1087
01:19:38,099 --> 01:19:39,601
We can't be so irresponsible.

1088
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:40,602
Otherwise,

1089
01:19:41,102 --> 01:19:42,604
we'll lead everyone
Into a disaster.

1090
01:19:43,104 --> 01:19:44,605
Don't be overdramatic.

1091
01:19:44,606 --> 01:19:46,607
What kind of disaster

1092
01:19:46,608 --> 01:19:48,610
could we possibly bring about?

1093
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:51,111
Raaaarr!

1094
01:19:51,112 --> 01:19:52,614
Lacy!

1095
01:20:33,655 --> 01:20:36,658
Aaahh...

1096
01:20:37,659 --> 01:20:38,660
oh!

1097
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:27,209
What's going on?

1098
01:21:43,225 --> 01:21:44,725
Are you sure you know

1099
01:21:44,726 --> 01:21:46,227
what you're doing, Mr. White?

1100
01:21:46,228 --> 01:21:47,228
Well...

1101
01:21:47,229 --> 01:21:49,230
uh... ahem.

1102
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:51,232
Here comes Mr. Warfield.

1103
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:54,235
You'd better have
an explanation, White,

1104
01:21:54,236 --> 01:21:56,738
or you'll talk
to your lawyers from jail.

1105
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,240
You know, I'm not a tycoon.

1106
01:21:59,241 --> 01:22:01,242
I'm just an old reporter,

1107
01:22:01,243 --> 01:22:04,245
but I've read enough
In my own newspaper

1108
01:22:04,246 --> 01:22:06,747
about hostile takeovers
of big companies,

1109
01:22:06,748 --> 01:22:08,749
and you, Mr. Warfield,

1110
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,252
must have been
asleep at the wheel,

1111
01:22:10,752 --> 01:22:13,754
because I convinced
the bankers of this city

1112
01:22:13,755 --> 01:22:16,257
that our daily planet
should be treated

1113
01:22:16,258 --> 01:22:20,261
like a natural resource,
protected from predators,

1114
01:22:20,262 --> 01:22:22,263
so I convinced them
to lend me the money.

1115
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:24,765
I bought up
the outstanding shares,

1116
01:22:24,766 --> 01:22:29,271
and you, Mr. Warfield, are
now a minority shareholder.

1117
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,772
Everyone back to work.

1118
01:22:31,773 --> 01:22:33,774
Way to go, chief!

1119
01:22:33,775 --> 01:22:36,277
Ha ha ha ha ha! Yay!

1120
01:22:36,278 --> 01:22:37,278
I'm sorry.

1121
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:39,280
You win some, you lose some.

1122
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:42,283
Now, this Is what
I call a newspaper.

1123
01:22:42,284 --> 01:22:44,285
Compliments of
the daily planet.

1124
01:22:44,286 --> 01:22:46,287
Have a nice day!

1125
01:22:46,288 --> 01:22:47,789
We did it! We're back!

1126
01:22:50,792 --> 01:22:52,793
Hi, everybody. Am I late?

1127
01:22:52,794 --> 01:22:54,795
Hey, Mr. Kent.
No, he's not here yet.

1128
01:22:54,796 --> 01:22:56,298
It must have been
an effort for you

1129
01:22:56,299 --> 01:22:58,299
to drag yourself
out of bed this morning.

1130
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,301
I'm feeling better.

1131
01:23:00,302 --> 01:23:01,802
Had a visit from a good nurse.

1132
01:23:01,803 --> 01:23:03,305
It must have been some
pretty good medicine,

1133
01:23:03,805 --> 01:23:05,307
because Miss lane said
you were really ill.

1134
01:23:05,807 --> 01:23:07,308
Jimmy, sometimes all you need.

1135
01:23:07,309 --> 01:23:08,310
Is some loving attention

1136
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:09,811
from the right person.

1137
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:11,312
Glad you're back, Clark...

1138
01:23:11,313 --> 01:23:12,813
and remember...

1139
01:23:12,814 --> 01:23:14,815
I am covering
Superman's press conference.

1140
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,817
You just tape crowd reactions.

1141
01:23:16,818 --> 01:23:18,819
Reactions, ok.

1142
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,321
Oh, dear.

1143
01:23:20,322 --> 01:23:21,822
Guess I'll need
a tape recorder.

1144
01:23:21,823 --> 01:23:22,823
Be right back.

1145
01:23:22,824 --> 01:23:24,325
Clark.

1146
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:27,328
Same old Mr. Kent.
He'll never change.

1147
01:23:27,329 --> 01:23:29,330
I hope not.

1148
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:30,832
Whoo!

1149
01:23:36,338 --> 01:23:37,838
Hi, Superman.

1150
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:40,341
Lois, good to see you again.

1151
01:23:40,342 --> 01:23:42,343
Good to see you, too.

1152
01:23:42,344 --> 01:23:43,844
Morning, gentlemen.

1153
01:23:43,845 --> 01:23:45,346
Excuse me.

1154
01:23:45,347 --> 01:23:46,847
Thank you.

1155
01:23:46,848 --> 01:23:49,350
We've survived
the threat of war

1156
01:23:49,351 --> 01:23:51,352
and found a fragile peace.

1157
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:54,855
I thought I could give
you freedom from war.

1158
01:23:54,856 --> 01:23:57,859
I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

1159
01:23:59,361 --> 01:24:01,362
We're still a young planet.

1160
01:24:01,363 --> 01:24:03,364
There are galaxies out there,

1161
01:24:03,365 --> 01:24:05,866
other civilizations
for us to meet,

1162
01:24:05,867 --> 01:24:08,869
to learn from.

1163
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,372
What a brilliant future
we could have.

1164
01:24:11,373 --> 01:24:13,374
And there will be peace

1165
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,377
when the world's people
want It so badly

1166
01:24:16,378 --> 01:24:20,381
that their governments will
have to give It to them.

1167
01:24:20,382 --> 01:24:24,885
I wish you could see
the earth as I do.

1168
01:24:24,886 --> 01:24:28,390
When you really see it,
It's just one world.

1169
01:24:32,227 --> 01:24:33,727
Think he'll find us?

1170
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:37,731
Never. We'll lay low
for a while,

1171
01:24:37,732 --> 01:24:39,233
couple of years.

1172
01:24:39,234 --> 01:24:42,236
I'll come up with a new plan.

1173
01:24:42,237 --> 01:24:45,240
Whoa. Good thing
I brought my drums.

1174
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,751
Oh, no!

1175
01:24:58,253 --> 01:25:00,754
Uncle Lex,
you won't believe this,

1176
01:25:00,755 --> 01:25:02,256
but It's...

1177
01:25:02,257 --> 01:25:03,258
Superman. Superman.

1178
01:25:03,259 --> 01:25:05,259
Oh, wow!

1179
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:06,260
Oh, wow!

1180
01:25:06,261 --> 01:25:10,764
Hey, this rocks! Hey!

1181
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:12,266
Morning, father.

1182
01:25:12,267 --> 01:25:13,766
Lenny's been under
a bad influence.

1183
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:14,769
Think you can help him?

1184
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,770
Every boy can be helped.

1185
01:25:16,771 --> 01:25:18,772
I think you're right.
Good luck, son.

1186
01:25:18,773 --> 01:25:19,774
Come with me, my friend.

1187
01:25:19,775 --> 01:25:22,276
Do you have a drum set?

1188
01:25:22,277 --> 01:25:25,780
Hey! Mozart's back!

1189
01:25:29,784 --> 01:25:31,285
Dwayne, Mozart's back!

1190
01:25:31,286 --> 01:25:33,288
I see him, bubba!

1191
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,791
Shut up!

1192
01:25:38,293 --> 01:25:39,292
Marshal, take him away.

1193
01:25:39,293 --> 01:25:40,293
Thank you kindly, Superman.

1194
01:25:40,294 --> 01:25:41,296
Come on, Luthor.

1195
01:25:41,297 --> 01:25:43,798
One thing... how'd you beat him?

1196
01:25:43,799 --> 01:25:45,300
High school physics.

1197
01:25:45,801 --> 01:25:47,802
I figured that If your creature

1198
01:25:47,803 --> 01:25:49,804
was born from the sun,

1199
01:25:49,805 --> 01:25:51,806
that was his energy source.

1200
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:53,307
Will the world be vaporized?

1201
01:25:53,308 --> 01:25:54,809
No, Luthor.

1202
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:56,310
As always, It's on the brink,

1203
01:25:56,311 --> 01:25:58,312
with good fighting evil.

1204
01:25:58,313 --> 01:25:59,815
See you In 20.

1205
01:27:18,935 --> 01:27:26,935
