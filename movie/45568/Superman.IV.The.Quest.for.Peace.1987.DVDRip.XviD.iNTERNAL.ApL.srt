1
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,594
<i>Listen carefully...</i>

2
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,290
<i>... my son.</i>

3
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:27,600
<i>By now, Kal-El...</i>

4
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:32,366
<i>... you are entering the atmosphere</i>
<i>of the planet known as Earth.</i>

5
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,372
<i>I pray you have made a safe journey.</i>

6
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:41,215
<i>The yellow sun of your new home</i>
<i>will give you great physical powers.</i>

7
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,282
<i>But it cannot console your spirit.</i>

8
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,614
<i>Placed aboard this vessel</i>
<i>is an energy module...</i>

9
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,956
<i>... all that remains</i>
<i>of a once-powerful civilization:</i>

10
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,688
<i>Krypton, your mother planet.</i>

11
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,868
<i>It is my last gift to you.</i>

12
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:05,396
<i>Once removed, the ship will</i>
<i>grow cold and silent...</i>

13
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:09,002
<i>... and you will be finally alone.</i>

14
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:13,647
<i>The power in the module</i>
<i>can be used but once.</i>

15
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:18,581
<i>Use it wisely, my son.</i>

16
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,214
Clark, you out here?

17
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,282
Clark Kent!

18
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:55,991
Hi, Mr. Hornsby.

19
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,155
Over here.

20
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,225
- There you are.
- How are you, sir?

21
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:02,556
- I'm fine, Clark. How are you?
- Nice to see you.

22
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,790
- It's been a long time.
- A long time.

23
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,492
I was tidying up for when
you show the place.

24
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:11,503
Didn't I mention there was
an offer to buy, sight unseen?

25
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,835
I don't want to sell this place
to a big developer.

26
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,877
The buyer has to want a real farm,
not another shopping center.

27
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,016
Now darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

28
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:25,517
Today, nobody wants a farm.

29
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:30,021
You blink your eye and they'll
all be gone. That's progress.

30
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,261
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

31
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,165
Oh, what a joker
old Jonathan Kent was.

32
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,672
You know, I asked him
what happened to the baby's crib.

33
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,465
And he said:

34
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:52,010
"Oh, little Clark must've had
a bad dream and kicked it."

35
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,649
- I swear, Dad liked a good joke.
- Yeah.

36
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:59,644
I was wondering, maybe you'd like
to keep these for your grandchildren.

37
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,483
Why, thank you very much, Clark.

38
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:04,354
Here, batter up.

39
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,458
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

40
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,424
- No, really...
- We'll hit a few.

41
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:16,037
Watch out now, these will
come in pretty fast.

42
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,742
You never could hit a curve ball!

43
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,617
That's my final decision
about the place.

44
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,811
I'm holding out for a real farmer.

45
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,349
You are?

46
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:39,328
And you're just as obstinate
as your father was too.

47
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,689
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

48
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:44,889
You be careful when you get back
to Metropolis, Clark.

49
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,392
It's a long, long way from
where you were born.

50
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:51,630
Yes, sir. I never forget that, sir.

51
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,740
- Bye.
- Bye, Clark.

52
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:18,194
What is that God-awful noise
you're making?

53
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,228
Mozart, my low-forehead friend.

54
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:26,874
Even this wretched pit can't diminish
the spirit of true genius.

55
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,410
Life itself started in a murky pit
much like this.

56
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:34,676
A true genius like myself
learns to seize the moment.

57
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,981
You're the first to know...

58
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:41,623
...that I now have plans
to re-create life itself.

59
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:46,257
Luthor, start breaking a sweat
or we'll throw you to the wolves.

60
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:48,521
Luthor, let's get them duds dirty.

61
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,131
- Move it, meathead.
- Let's see a little sweat.

62
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,733
What's that car doing here?!

63
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,800
Stop that vehicle!

64
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,607
- Hey, stop!
- Hold it there, son.

65
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:05,002
Yo! Where the hell is this and how
the hell do I get to Cedar City?

66
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,247
You on the wrong side
of the state, boy.

67
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,385
- No chance.
- Oh, no.

68
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:16,920
You got a fine, fine super-fine
sound system here, son.

69
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,828
I guess you dudes have never seen
one of these Sensurround 100s?

70
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:24,397
Yeah, I seen one once in a magazine.

71
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,898
Well, heck. Come on, get in.

72
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:28,534
- Really?
- Come on.

73
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:29,670
Really?

74
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:32,567
- You wanted to hear it, come on!
- All right.

75
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:35,867
Hop in, Bubba.
Let's give it a listen.

76
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,908
Hey, this is great!

77
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,740
Doors...

78
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,251
What's going on?

79
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,386
Windows...

80
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:50,048
- What's happening?
- The top.

81
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:51,358
Seats!

82
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,362
Lordy! Lordy!

83
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:57,164
And away!

84
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,194
Y'all come back and see us!

85
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:03,235
Oh, no!

86
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,773
Launch.

87
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,839
All right!

88
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,910
Did I do okay or what, Uncle Lex?

89
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:20,953
Lenny, you've always been the
Dutch elm disease of my family tree.

90
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,590
But this time you did fine.

91
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,597
You gonna skip the country, Uncle Lex?

92
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,992
You pathetic product
of the public schools...

93
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,635
...I've had nothing
on my awesome mind...

94
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,328
...since I've been incarcerated
except one thing:

95
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,041
- Destroy Superman!
- Destroy Superman!

96
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:45,807
Sorry.

97
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,729
Clark!

98
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,362
Help!

99
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,693
Help! Help!

100
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,893
Somebody get help!

101
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,612
Superman!

102
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,540
He's okay. He needs a doctor.

103
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,113
Superman!

104
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,283
Gentlemen, one moment.

105
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,779
I want people to know that
our subway system...

106
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:35,184
...is the safest and most reliable
means of public transit.

107
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,380
Thank you.

108
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:41,521
Thanks.

109
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,665
You're late, Kent.

110
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:48,696
Sorry, Mr. White, won't happen again.

111
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:51,063
Where is everybody?

112
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,365
Boring.

113
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,567
Tedious.

114
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,178
- Hey, what's going on?
- Abominable!

115
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:03,475
<i>- Regardez, voilà</i> David Warfield.
- David Warfield...

116
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,586
...who owns those sleazy tabloids?

117
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:10,589
<i>Au contraire.</i> Who owns all those
sleazy tabloids and <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

118
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,457
Tedious.

119
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,253
You only read the pictures?

120
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,831
The fact is, Mr. White,
that I only read the ledger.

121
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:23,061
A ledger which the previous owners
paid so little attention to...

122
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,297
...I bought the paper from them.

123
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,806
<i>The Daily Planet</i> hasn't made
any money in three years.

124
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,511
And the name of the game
is making money.

125
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:36,077
Ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter, Lacy Warfield.

126
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,310
- Thanks, Daddy.
- It's nice to meet you.

127
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:42,956
Mr. White, Lacy will be helping you.

128
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:45,126
Helping me? Helping me what?

129
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,955
I have some mock copies
of our new layout.

130
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:50,154
It's super.

131
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,630
The suit's not right,
but we can change that.

132
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,393
Excuse me, Mr. Warfield.

133
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:59,097
The world isn't really on the brink.
Isn't that headline irresponsible?

134
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:01,809
Maybe, but it'll sell
a lot of newspapers.

135
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,408
Mr. White, don't do anything rash.

136
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:09,380
I won't let you turn this grand
old lady into one of your bimbos...

137
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:14,284
Mr. White, may I point out that Daddy
holds all of your contracts...

138
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,583
...which you will have to honor.

139
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,192
<i>Excusez-moi,</i> your spoiled-ness...

140
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,056
Why is Lois speaking French?

141
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:26,030
...I have a plane to catch to Paris for
the emergency Ministers' Conference...

142
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,170
Not so fast. All trips are canceled.

143
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,233
You mean my trip to Paris is canceled?

144
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,635
Mr. White, you come with me.

145
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,675
I want to see your books.
Everyone get back to work.

146
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,678
We're not being treated fairly.
I'm speaking to Lacy.

147
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:41,850
Me too.

148
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,575
Excuse me, Miss Warfield.

149
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:47,722
I speak for us all when I say
we'll do our best to cooperate.

150
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,522
Thank you.

151
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,558
But a reporter's first allegiance
is to the truth.

152
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:56,559
The people of this city depend on us
and we can't let them down.

153
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:58,692
Thank you.

154
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:04,896
Is he for real?

155
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,434
100 percent, and I like him that way.

156
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,236
Oh, you have a thing for him.

157
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,142
For Clark?! No!

158
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,249
He's kind of cute.

159
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:19,218
Look, Miss Warfield...

160
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,879
...Clark is the oldest
living boy scout, okay?

161
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,390
He's trustworthy, he's helpful...

162
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:28,256
...he's loyal, he's obedient, he...

163
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,525
I don't know how to tell you this.

164
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:35,432
I just don't think he'd be attracted
to somebody like you.

165
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:40,301
Don't be silly. All men like me.
I'm very, very rich!

166
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,146
Why are there no air travel expenses
for you, Mr. Kent?

167
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,815
I get airsick, especially
when it's bumpy.

168
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,248
Lois, get in here!

169
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:55,115
Lois, explain this column of figures.

170
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:58,955
- The president is coming on live.
- What, right now?

171
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,024
- It won't be very good news.
- You always overreact.

172
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:06,497
- It won't be that terrible.
- Hopefully very terrible, Miss Lane.

173
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:09,728
We can double our circulation
with an international crisis.

174
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:12,600
<i>And because the summit has failed...</i>

175
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:17,944
<i>... we have no choice but</i>
<i>to strive to be second to none...</i>

176
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,047
<i>... in the nuclear arms race.</i>

177
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:24,845
<i>Therefore, I am announcing</i>
<i>the following measures...</i>

178
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:30,521
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

179
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,129
The best thing we can do
is to try to think positively.

180
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:40,301
Now, is there anything we can do?
Doesn't anyone have a suggestion?

181
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,466
All right, I'll make a suggestion.

182
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,341
Why don't we write to our congressman?

183
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,345
- That'll do a lot of good.
- Somebody has to be an optimist.

184
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,179
Jeremy?

185
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:02,189
- What could we do about the crisis?
- He doesn't know what's going on.

186
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,194
I know who I'd write a letter to
that would do some good.

187
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,797
- Who? Santa Claus?
- No, Superman!

188
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,126
Superman, the subject
of our exhibit...

189
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:16,634
...has donated a strand
of his hair to the museum...

190
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:19,831
...so we can have the fun
of seeing how strong he really is.

191
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,203
Here you see a 1000-pound load...

192
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:25,971
...easily suspended
by his single hair.

193
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:30,345
The museum will be closing soon,
so we should hurry a little.

194
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:34,616
Know what I can do with a single
strand of Superman's hair?

195
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,121
You could make a toupee that flies.

196
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:41,291
That hair is a sample
of Superman's genetic material.

197
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:43,726
The building blocks of his body.

198
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:48,332
With my genius and enough nuclear
power to mutate the genes...

199
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,734
...I can create a being
who's more powerful than him.

200
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,075
With total allegiance to me.

201
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,751
You better stand back.
Keep your eye out.

202
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:42,651
- Miss Warfield, you wanted to see me?
- Hi, Clark. Please come in.

203
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:45,853
I've come up with a brilliant idea.

204
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:47,528
Oh, really?

205
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:49,458
Well, Daddy thinks it's brilliant.

206
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,601
I want you to write a new series
called "Metropolis After Hours."

207
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,463
Who, me? I...

208
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,697
It's wonderful. It's great, isn't it?

209
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:03,007
- I don't think I'd be right for this.
- Oh, you're perfect for it.

210
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:06,874
I mean, you're young, you're single,
you're successful.

211
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,743
I'm usually in bed by 10:30.

212
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,647
That's just it, see, you don't
have to flaunt it.

213
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,583
I mean, you're no slave to fashion.
Although...

214
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,851
...have you ever thought of contacts?
- They make my eyes itch.

215
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:22,428
Don't worry about it. I thought
we could do this together.

216
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:24,963
- Oh?
- I know all the right places.

217
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,067
I'm a member of all the right clubs.

218
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,965
We'll start tonight at the opening
of the Metro Club.

219
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:33,141
- Oh, tonight.
- Yeah, it's a date.

220
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:34,309
A date!

221
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,510
A date?

222
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,406
Well, it's just business, actually.

223
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,346
I've got a letter here for Superman,
care of me.

224
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,610
- What?
- Superman gets mail here?

225
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,687
It's probably a picture request.
I can take care of it.

226
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,848
I think it's more than just
a fan letter. You should read it.

227
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:57,390
"Dear Superman, my teacher spoke about
the president's speech on the arms race.

228
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:02,232
We're all very unhappy about it.

229
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:07,608
And I said we should get Superman
to rid the world of nuclear arms...

230
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,507
...because only he could do it.

231
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:17,380
Once you've destroyed all the nuclear
missiles, they'll see I'm right.

232
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,113
Superman can make sure we don't
blow ourselves up, quick and easy.

233
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:24,417
I know you'll come through.
Your friend, Jeremy."

234
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:27,789
Poor kid. Oh, well,
I better get back to work.

235
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,796
- No, there's an angle in this.
- An angle! He's just a kid!

236
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,767
Daddy loves whipping up campaigns.
Oh, boy, and the public loves it!

237
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:38,439
Lacy!

238
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:40,572
We'll make him a celebrity.

239
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,837
Everybody in the world is gonna be
wondering what Superman's reply is.

240
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:50,544
Welcome to Metropolis, Jeremy.

241
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:54,313
I'm Mr. Warfield and this is
my daughter, Lacy Warfield.

242
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:57,253
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Now come along and meet the press.

243
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,927
- Don't you trip.
- The car had a flat.

244
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,993
Sorry to hear that.
Turn around.

245
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:04,461
Let everybody get a picture of you.

246
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,827
- That's it, everyone.
- Here, Jeremy.

247
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,560
What a boy! Now come along...

248
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,934
...and tell the American public
what you told me.

249
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:16,144
I just said I wish Superman
would've said yes.

250
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,005
- Did you get that?
- No, we didn't.

251
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,578
Well, say it again. Loudly.

252
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:23,910
I just said I wish Superman
would've just said yes!

253
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,052
Miss Lane!

254
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:37,297
Miss Lane. Take a look at this.
Hot off the press.

255
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:39,432
Oh, my God!

256
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:43,126
This time he's gone too far.
Look, Clark. Look at that.

257
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,431
Can't wait to see
the chief's reaction.

258
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:48,573
I'm through taking it lying down.

259
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:51,108
Anybody wants me, I'll be downtown.

260
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,310
Chief look different to you?

261
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,516
He looks like my father when he went
to the bank to ask for a loan.

262
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,919
I'm gonna make sure he's all right.

263
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:05,392
There's nothing we can do about it.
It's Superman's decision now.

264
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:08,194
I'm sure he'll do the right thing.

265
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,435
<i>May the elders watch over you...</i>

266
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:50,501
<i>... my son.</i>

267
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,600
<i>Their wisdom is all that is left</i>
<i>of a once powerful...</i>

268
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:58,005
<i>... and enlightened planet.</i>

269
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:03,410
<i>You must listen to them, Kal-El.</i>

270
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:05,945
<i>Listen.</i>

271
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,725
I know I'm forbidden to interfere.

272
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:18,865
And yet the Earth is threatened
by the same fate as Krypton's.

273
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,535
The Earth is too primitive.

274
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,829
You can flee to new worlds...

275
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:27,434
...where war is long forgotten.

276
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:31,307
If you teach the Earth to put
its fate in any one man...

277
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,780
...even yourself, you're teaching them
to be betrayed.

278
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,278
Betrayed... betrayed...

279
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:44,458
...betrayed... betrayed!

280
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,655
<i>And because the summit has failed...</i>

281
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:54,130
<i>... we have no choice but to strive...</i>

282
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:59,273
<i>... to be second to none</i>
<i>in the nuclear arms race.</i>

283
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:01,175
<i>To that end...</i>

284
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:04,401
<i>... this administration has pursued...</i>

285
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,444
<i>... and will continue to pursue...</i>

286
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,776
<i>... the most vigorous policy.</i>

287
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:11,517
<i>Therefore...</i>

288
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,215
Just a minute.

289
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,889
- Lois?
- There you are. What happened?

290
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,931
- What do you mean, what happened?
- Nothing, just:

291
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,602
"Meet in the lobby at 6 for
the awards dinner.

292
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:30,998
Wear something nice
and don't be late."

293
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:35,006
- Was it some other Lois?
- I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

294
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:38,144
Okay, go get your penguin suit on
and we'll go.

295
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:43,175
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.

296
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:45,114
But you go ahead. Okay?

297
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:49,480
Clark?

298
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:52,323
Something's wrong, isn't it?

299
00:26:55,864 --> 00:27:00,096
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, you can, as a matter of fact.

300
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:03,032
- What?
- Could we go get some fresh air?

301
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,534
Fresh air?

302
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:09,875
Fresh air. Fresh air, sure.

303
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:11,909
Sure, Clark. Sure.

304
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,714
Who needs chicken with
all the fixings anyway?

305
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:17,476
Let's go. Come on.
Let's get some fresh air.

306
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,912
Breathe. Do you feel better?

307
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,057
Clark?

308
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:26,022
Clark? Clark, things aren't
that bad! Stop!

309
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,421
Oh, Clark!

310
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:29,891
Clark! Clark!

311
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,874
Superman!

312
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,323
You okay?

313
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,856
Great.

314
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:15,702
Hey, look at that.

315
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:28,951
There you go. Bye-bye!

316
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:02,390
- How'd you like going solo?
- I loved it.

317
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,558
But not as much as being with you.

318
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,626
I needed to be with you too.
You make me laugh.

319
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,829
You're the only one
I can talk to, Lois.

320
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:18,662
See, sometimes I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

321
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,506
I'm always here for you, you know that.

322
00:29:24,112 --> 00:29:27,707
And you'll do the right thing,
no matter what. You always have.

323
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:29,375
Thank you.

324
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:32,382
- You know something?
- What?

325
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:36,653
- You don't even know my name.
- Kal-El.

326
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,652
You remember, don't you?

327
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:43,623
I remember everything.

328
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:48,802
"Never set one of them above the rest.
Love all humanity instead."

329
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,504
That's not fair.

330
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:21,198
Lois.

331
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:24,363
Lois, it's time to go. We'll be late.

332
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,040
What am I doing out here
freezing my butt off?

333
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,043
Oh, you wanted some fresh air.

334
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:37,182
Oh, no that's okay.
I don't want to catch a cold.

335
00:30:37,385 --> 00:30:41,754
I feel kind of weird,
like I'm jetlagged or something.

336
00:30:41,956 --> 00:30:43,924
- Jeepers!
- Like I'm going crazy.

337
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:50,096
- How about you? Are you still down?
- Nope. Things are pretty clear.

338
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:54,432
Good. Too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

339
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,402
Clark, you gotta go with your gut.

340
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:02,035
Come on.

341
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,505
Okay, here you go, Jeremy.

342
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,417
Mr. Warfield wants me to get shots
of you with local color...

343
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,383
...but I can't think of anything.

344
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:18,048
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Superman!

345
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:19,951
Jimmy.

346
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:21,893
What a scoop!

347
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:25,558
- How'd you like to take a walk?
- Sure!

348
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,359
Jimmy, come on.

349
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,483
You can't! You'll get towed.

350
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,151
Do you know how much
a ticket costs?

351
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:48,913
Lacy, it's only money.

352
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,393
Will you wait for me
upstairs in the gallery?

353
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:01,591
Sure, okay.

354
00:32:01,803 --> 00:32:03,964
- Good luck, Superman.
- Thanks.

355
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,478
I saved you a seat.

356
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,281
All right, Superman!

357
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,817
I don't represent any country but
I'd like to address the delegates.

358
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,022
Well, in that case,
you will need a sponsor.

359
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,163
I believe that will do. Please.

360
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:42,233
Thank you.

361
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,978
What's he gonna say?

362
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,512
Something wonderful.

363
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,175
Madam Secretary...

364
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:55,244
...honorable delegates,
ladies and gentlemen.

365
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,516
For many years now
I've lived among you as...

366
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,560
...a visitor. I've seen
the beauty of your many cultures.

367
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,927
I've felt joy in your magnificent
accomplishments.

368
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:09,234
I've also seen the folly of your wars.

369
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:14,108
As of today I'm not a visitor
anymore, because the Earth...

370
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,703
...is my home too.

371
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:20,307
We can't live in fear.
And I can't stand...

372
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:24,042
...idly by and watch us
stumble into the madness...

373
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,243
...of possible nuclear destruction.

374
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,253
I've come to a decision.

375
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,590
I'm going to do what our governments
have been unwilling to do.

376
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:37,994
Effective immediately, I'm going to
rid our planet of all nuclear weapons.

377
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,630
All right, Superman!

378
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,707
Way to go, Superman!

379
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:05,651
Missile test Alpha, all systems go.

380
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,488
<i>- three... two... one.</i>

381
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:58,697
Oh!

382
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,465
Oh. Nice to see you guys!

383
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:07,811
Why don't you just relax there.
I'll get on with the introductions:

384
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,107
Dixie.

385
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:11,146
And Trixie.

386
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:18,518
From the land of the free, the home of
the great cost overrun, Harry Howler:

387
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:22,292
Nuclear strategist from
America's top think tank.

388
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:25,056
And a great little warmonger
in his own right.

389
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,757
A hearty <i>bienvenue</i>
to Jean-Pierre Dubois:

390
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:31,264
Nuclear warhead dealer to the world.

391
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,296
His motto is:

392
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,038
"If you didn't buy it
from Jean-Pierre...

393
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,404
...you didn't buy it
on the black market."

394
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:40,980
General Romoff.

395
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:44,580
A lot of people think of you
as the "Mad Russian."

396
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:49,455
I like to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

397
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:51,124
Please be seated.

398
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:57,296
Look guys. I know you're all choked
up, kind of overcome with joy...

399
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:00,262
...that Superman has ended
the arms race.

400
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:05,397
But if we work together,
we can make the world safe...

401
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,937
...for war profits.

402
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,433
Get to the point.

403
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:12,371
The point is, I, Lex Luthor, greatest
criminal mind of the modern era...

404
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,877
...have found a way
to destroy Superman.

405
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:17,744
Behold, my unscrupulous friends...

406
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:21,585
Shut those blinds.

407
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,384
- The sun is hurting my eyes!
- Exactly.

408
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,318
You know what the sun is?

409
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:30,326
It's nothing more than
a huge nuclear bomb...

410
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:35,161
...a bomb with so much radiation, it'd
incinerate the average man like that!

411
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,964
Yes, but Superman is no average man.

412
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,934
Aha, right!

413
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,810
What is your plan?

414
00:37:44,478 --> 00:37:48,380
Boys, old Lex here
has kind of a secret recipe...

415
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:52,348
...a genetic stew in this dish,
if you will.

416
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:55,820
If you'll help me put this
on one of your missiles...

417
00:37:56,023 --> 00:38:00,653
...I promise you, Superman will have
the biggest surprise of his life.

418
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:05,289
I'll introduce him to his first
nightmare, a "Nuclear Man."

419
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:09,868
He'll pierce his skin. He'll make
him mortal. He'll become sick.

420
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,005
We'll dance on his grave.

421
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,976
Why should we deal with
a notorious scoundrel like you?

422
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,370
Remember my motto:

423
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:20,444
"The more fear you make,
the more loot you take."

424
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:22,707
And the more missiles you guys sell...

425
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:26,375
Yes, but what's in it for you?

426
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,454
A tiny commission.

427
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,883
Something appropriate.

428
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,092
A number...

429
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,996
...with a lot of zeros behind it.

430
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,600
Lenny.

431
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:50,038
The new genetic material.

432
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:54,337
And now, Leonard...

433
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,674
...your Uncle Lex...

434
00:38:56,884 --> 00:39:01,378
...with this protoplasm that I have
grown from Superman's hair cells...

435
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,523
...will duplicate creation itself.

436
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:08,593
Now the fabric.

437
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,422
Uncle Lex, this ain't gonna cover him.

438
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:18,263
The computer inside will...

439
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,835
...leave enough material to maintain
the high moral standards...

440
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:26,478
...that I've always subscribed to.

441
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,545
Know what this means, Uncle Lex?

442
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,007
What?

443
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:31,775
We're gonna be parents.

444
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,648
- What's your name, sergeant?
- York, sir.

445
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,046
At ease.

446
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:40,110
Launch control. Yes, sir.

447
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:42,084
Yes, sir.

448
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:45,216
There's a weather problem.
We gotta hold.

449
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:46,987
Hold?

450
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:49,463
- What's your name, son?
- Goram.

451
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:50,960
"Goram, sir."

452
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:53,531
- Goram, sir.
- Goram, you know your code book?

453
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:55,031
Of course, sir.

454
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:59,400
27-0-6, inclement override.
Fire on my command. Fire.

455
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,200
Yes, sir. Stand by to launch.

456
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,872
Ten... nine...

457
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:20,258
Missed us.

458
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:40,199
Reach out.

459
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,298
Come on.

460
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:44,610
Down.

461
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:46,477
Reach out.

462
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,944
And stretch.

463
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,411
Down.

464
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:52,181
Up.

465
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:55,680
- Clark, are you okay?
- I think I better sit this one out.

466
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:59,791
You sure? This would be great for
your series on the young Metropolis.

467
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,894
Let's try it again. Come on.

468
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:04,826
Two, three, four.

469
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:07,967
One, two, three.

470
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:11,399
- I don't think so.
- What, are you okay?

471
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,111
28.

472
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:22,373
29.

473
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:23,913
23.

474
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,219
- Done. Great.
- Okay, you try it now.

475
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:31,714
- Let's set it a little higher for you.
- Okay.

476
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:33,651
Just push down.

477
00:43:37,598 --> 00:43:41,193
- Are you okay? Just step down.
- Need some help?

478
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,965
Your friend doesn't know
his own strength.

479
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:46,799
Clark, this is Paul.

480
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,872
- He's a trainer here.
- Hi.

481
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:51,339
Hey, I got just the thing for you.

482
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,441
Over here, Clarky.

483
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:55,041
Clarky?

484
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,581
It's real nice of him to help me out.

485
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,287
- He's really good.
- Here, try this one.

486
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:07,688
Clark! Are you okay? Sorry.

487
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,590
No pain, no gain.

488
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,628
Jeez, what a jerk.

489
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,429
Never realized it before.

490
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,336
I guess a lot of people
I know are jerks.

491
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,974
Maybe you think I'm one too.
That's why you keep avoiding me.

492
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:26,711
Oh, no, I don't think that at all.
Just been really busy, that's all.

493
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:28,815
But wait.

494
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:33,645
You know Lois is doing that interview
with Superman about his peace mission.

495
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:38,085
Well, I was thinking the four of us
can get together and have high tea.

496
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:39,758
It's very chic.

497
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,895
- Can you hand me those weights, Clark?
- Excuse me.

498
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,955
Wait a minute, Lacy.

499
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:49,732
Come early. The view is so romantic
from my balcony. See you.

500
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:54,233
- Oh, sure. Here.
- Not those! The other one!

501
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:57,236
No pain, no gain?

502
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:08,249
What was that?

503
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:15,119
Uncle Lex...
You're spooking me out.

504
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,590
There.

505
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:23,826
Madam, thank you very much.

506
00:45:48,128 --> 00:45:49,425
I'm incredible.

507
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:53,431
Uncle Lex, he's like...

508
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,370
He's beautiful. He's perfect.

509
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:01,074
Welcome home, Nuclear Man.

510
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:03,839
Your father's happy to see you.

511
00:46:19,426 --> 00:46:22,953
The power of the sun has given him
internally generated heat.

512
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,497
I'm a...

513
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:29,534
You are...

514
00:46:30,637 --> 00:46:34,164
I'm... What? I'm a genius?

515
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:36,376
I'm incredible. I'm...

516
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,945
You are nothing.

517
00:46:39,513 --> 00:46:41,174
I am the father now.

518
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:42,415
You have my voice.

519
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:45,680
No, you have my voice.

520
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,244
Just remember, I made you.

521
00:46:48,622 --> 00:46:51,523
Yeah, you're just an experiment,
freako.

522
00:46:53,994 --> 00:46:55,188
What is that?

523
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:59,755
- Oh, no.
- I'm an experiment. I'm a freako.

524
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:03,069
I was just kidding about
that freako line!

525
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,330
If anybody's a freako around here,
it's gotta be me!

526
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,237
Oh, wow, I'm break dancing, hey!

527
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:13,343
This rocks. Hey!

528
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:17,910
I made you. I can destroy you.

529
00:47:18,285 --> 00:47:19,809
Destroy.

530
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,379
Destroy Superman now.

531
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:26,088
You sweet thing.
But not quite yet, no.

532
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:30,758
Come here. We'll discuss
when the proper time is.

533
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,733
Uncle Lex.

534
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,744
Oh, no!

535
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,949
He's, like... He's, like, cold.

536
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,640
Of course he is.

537
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,419
That's his vulnerability. That's
the only way he can be stopped.

538
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,749
What?

539
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:03,329
Lenny, my loud-mouthed nephew,
he gets his energy from the sun.

540
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,860
Without it, he's like you at night:

541
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,330
Useless.

542
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:23,143
Well, nobody's perfect.

543
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,649
I never had a double date before.
This is fun. How do I look?

544
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:39,160
Illegal. Like the last six dresses
you tried on.

545
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:43,598
Listen, Lacy? I don't want to
burst your bubble or anything but...

546
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:46,136
...Clark's not gonna notice
what you're wearing.

547
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:48,102
Yes, he will. There's Clark.

548
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,038
Okay, fix that. There you go.
You look great.

549
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:54,270
- Maybe it's just Superman.
- No.

550
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:58,977
No, Superman makes a different
kind of entrance.

551
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:11,858
- Hi, Lacy.
- Hi, Clark.

552
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:14,625
Can you break a 20?
Driver didn't have any change.

553
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:17,400
Yeah, sure. Let me get my purse.

554
00:49:17,604 --> 00:49:19,538
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

555
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,669
- Clark.
- What?

556
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:23,467
You are not gonna believe
this list of questions...

557
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,235
...Mr. Warfield gave me
to ask Superman. Look.

558
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,507
"Aren't you part of a plot
to weaken our national defense?"

559
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,208
- Oh, my goodness.
- I think his gray matter is...

560
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,856
- How will I ask him these questions?
- Well, politely I guess.

561
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,686
Let's see, I have 18 dollars and...

562
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:44,794
Clark, she really likes you,
so notice the dress.

563
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,824
...my American Express card.

564
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:49,434
- Dress.
- Oh, hey, neat dress.

565
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:51,665
Well, thanks. Be right back.

566
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:56,874
What's that?

567
00:49:59,146 --> 00:50:01,614
Now, there's a different
kind of entrance.

568
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:06,917
- Hi, Lois.
- Hello, Superman.

569
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,382
How are you?

570
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:10,152
I'm fine.

571
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:15,488
Oh, Superman, this is Lacy Warfield.
She's the boss' daughter.

572
00:50:15,696 --> 00:50:18,062
How do you do?
That's a very attractive outfit.

573
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,701
- I think we better start our interview.
- Excuse me.

574
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:23,392
Two's company.

575
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,871
Oh, right, yeah.
Yeah, I'll go get Clark.

576
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:33,276
He's probably helping the driver
change a tire, or some other good deed.

577
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,310
That guy.

578
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:38,477
- Something smells wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

579
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:41,279
I'm cooking some scallops
and some duck...

580
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:44,980
...in this wonderful mushroom sauce
with champagne.

581
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:47,524
In case we got hungry afterwards.

582
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,588
I mean, later.

583
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,491
You shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble.

584
00:50:59,005 --> 00:51:01,235
Should we get on with the interview?

585
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,569
Yes, let's. Let's get on
with the interview.

586
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:13,352
Have you had any trouble
confiscating the missiles?

587
00:51:13,787 --> 00:51:16,813
There always was the possibility
that warped individuals...

588
00:51:17,023 --> 00:51:19,856
...would take advantage of
the world's goodwill, but...

589
00:51:21,728 --> 00:51:23,195
Is there something wrong?

590
00:51:26,867 --> 00:51:29,734
Oh! My dinner! My dinner!

591
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:31,665
I'll be right back.

592
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,469
Be right back.

593
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,016
Hi.

594
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,189
- I missed you, Clark.
- Oh. Ah, well...

595
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,190
It's so boring with Lois and Superman.
Let's do something wild.

596
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:57,022
Gee, they're expecting us.
It wouldn't be polite.

597
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,754
Yeah, you're right.

598
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:03,000
How can one man be so square
and so delicious?

599
00:52:04,304 --> 00:52:08,434
All right, let's go chitchat. If I
have to face Superman, so do you.

600
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:10,376
Lacy?

601
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:13,970
Oh, Clark.

602
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:16,105
Stop!

603
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:40,135
I don't believe it! I never had duck
turn out so perfectly. It's amazing!

604
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:41,340
I'm out here, Lois.

605
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,799
Oh.

606
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,722
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, it is beautiful.

607
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,624
The whole world is beautiful.

608
00:53:03,697 --> 00:53:08,293
I've always felt moments like this
should be shared with someone you...

609
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,703
Someone you care a lot about.

610
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:15,732
Isn't that the doorbell?

611
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:17,667
Yes.

612
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:35,623
Lacy!

613
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:38,060
Where's Clark?

614
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:40,426
He started to get in the elevator...

615
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,932
Oh, never mind, it's a long story.

616
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,229
It always is with Clark.

617
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:47,897
Oh, great, that's him.

618
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:51,771
- Clark?
- Hi.

619
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,446
Those bellboys ought to
look where they're going.

620
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,206
Superman?

621
00:53:56,516 --> 00:53:59,815
- I'm so glad you're back.
- Is dinner ready? Can we eat?

622
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,318
- Yeah, let's go sit down.
- Oh, great.

623
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,052
- Sorry!
- My goodness! No, that's okay.

624
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:12,322
Just leave it there, Clark.
It's stuck on your pants.

625
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:15,899
Yeah, let me just get a rag.
Excuse me, be right back.

626
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:21,297
Where's Clark?

627
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:27,745
<i>Hello, Dolly</i>
<i>Hello, Dolly</i>

628
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:31,941
<i>It's so nice to have me back</i>
<i>Where I belong</i>

629
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:36,419
<i>Don't be concerned, Blue Boy.</i>
<i>You're the only one who can hear me.</i>

630
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:39,888
<i>It's my own private frequency.</i>
<i>You might call it "Lex TV."</i>

631
00:54:40,493 --> 00:54:43,257
<i>Look to your left,</i>
<i>tall, dark and handsome.</i>

632
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:48,965
<i>I'm gonna blow 20 stories off that</i>
<i>building, give or take a floor or two.</i>

633
00:54:49,169 --> 00:54:50,261
<i>Peace.</i>

634
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:52,930
Men.

635
00:54:53,173 --> 00:54:55,164
I hope Clark's okay. I better look.

636
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:56,568
Okay.

637
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:03,978
I'm sorry, but an emergency's come up.
My apologies to Miss Warfield.

638
00:55:04,184 --> 00:55:05,378
Oh, but...

639
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:09,418
Superman! Take me with you!
I can cover the story!

640
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:12,914
You seen Clark?

641
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:25,866
Guess who. It's your old friend Lex.

642
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:31,501
I suspect if you'd actually planted
a bomb, you'd be miles away by now.

643
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,175
This is my nephew Lenny.

644
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:35,609
He worships me.

645
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:40,081
The dude of steel.
Boy, are you gonna get it!

646
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:45,786
Silly me, thinking that
I could fool a super guy.

647
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:48,426
You're right. No bomb.

648
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:52,120
It's just that you're so involved
in this world peace bit...

649
00:55:52,332 --> 00:55:54,732
...you don't have time
for social calls.

650
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:57,966
I confess, I tricked you.

651
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,303
You look great.

652
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:02,907
Never mind the small talk.
What are you up to?

653
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:05,773
You know you're a workaholic?

654
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:08,812
You're playing a good guy
24 hours a day.

655
00:56:09,015 --> 00:56:11,176
Why don't you stop and
smell the roses?

656
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:14,581
Get yourself a hobby? A pet?
A kitten, a puppy?

657
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:19,157
I know you hate children and animals.
What are you doing back in Metropolis?

658
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,819
I want to be first to introduce
you to the new kid on the block.

659
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,809
Look closely at the cell structure.

660
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:42,281
You see anything familiar?

661
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,745
You've already broken
all the laws of man.

662
00:56:45,952 --> 00:56:48,648
Now you've broken the laws
of nature too.

663
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:51,187
I can only assume you hid a device...

664
00:56:51,391 --> 00:56:53,689
...in a missile I hurled into the sun.

665
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:57,827
Mr. Muscle, I'm gonna really miss
these little chats we have together.

666
00:56:58,031 --> 00:57:00,261
You're the only one who can
keep up with me.

667
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,862
- Lenny!
- What?

668
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,930
I wanna propose a toast.

669
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:10,775
To a nice guy, who's about
to finish last.

670
00:57:14,147 --> 00:57:15,739
Destroy Superman!

671
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:17,375
Later.

672
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:21,110
He's a little bit anxious.
Can you blame him?

673
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,514
Not one of your great thinkers.

674
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:27,852
But I, in all modesty, am.

675
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:32,395
The touching thing about this plan
is you helped me devise it.

676
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:35,796
Prison has twisted
your mind into a delusional state.

677
00:57:36,002 --> 00:57:38,095
No, no, no. Listen.

678
00:57:38,304 --> 00:57:41,432
When I escaped from prison
I had one thing on my mind:

679
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:43,403
The end of Superman.

680
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,276
So there I was,
the first time in my life...

681
00:57:46,479 --> 00:57:51,178
...that I didn't have a long-range,
truly devious, criminal scheme.

682
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,443
And then I came up with it.

683
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:55,452
With this guy...

684
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:57,279
...and you gone...

685
00:57:57,524 --> 00:58:00,015
...I'll make a fortune
rearming the world.

686
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,821
You'd risk global nuclear war for
your own personal financial gain.

687
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:08,262
Nobody wants war. I just want
to keep the threat alive.

688
00:58:11,204 --> 00:58:12,603
Nifty, huh?

689
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,037
Good night, sweet prince.

690
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:22,772
Parting is...

691
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:24,577
...inevitable.

692
00:58:25,652 --> 00:58:27,711
Destroy Superman!

693
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:30,455
First, I have fun.

694
00:59:34,354 --> 00:59:35,446
Help me!

695
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:46,425
Thanks, Superman!

696
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:25,469
I said I'd get you to run
one of our papers yourself...

697
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,605
...and I meant it.

698
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:31,003
Congratulations, Miss Publisher.

699
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:33,677
Thank you, Daddy, that's very nice.

700
01:05:33,879 --> 01:05:35,369
Step into your office.

701
01:05:38,284 --> 01:05:40,912
- Where'd this come from?
- Somebody brought it in.

702
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,587
We bought it, cheap.

703
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:45,723
Okay...
This time you've gone too far.

704
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:50,128
You can print your stupid rag
without Lois Lane.

705
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:57,167
And you certainly have
no right to this!

706
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,638
- Lois, I'm sorry!
- Let her go, darling.

707
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,568
I mean, she's useless.

708
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,503
And while you're at it,
fire that Clark Kent.

709
01:06:05,745 --> 01:06:08,236
He hasn't been around.
He hasn't even telephoned.

710
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:10,745
I know, I'm worried about him.

711
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,577
Oh, kitten...

712
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:17,279
...didn't we have a talk about
personal involvement with the help?

713
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:20,254
- Now that you're the publisher...
- Daddy.

714
01:06:20,459 --> 01:06:22,518
- Yes, darling.
- Stuff it!

715
01:06:25,264 --> 01:06:28,028
Lois! Lois, I'm sorry.

716
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,930
I promise you I had
nothing to do with that.

717
01:06:37,643 --> 01:06:39,201
Have you heard from Clark?

718
01:06:43,115 --> 01:06:44,343
No.

719
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,306
Just a minute.

720
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:12,308
Oh, Lois.

721
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:15,377
- What are you doing here?
- I knew it.

722
01:07:16,182 --> 01:07:19,982
I just have a really bad flu.
What do you mean you knew it?

723
01:07:20,186 --> 01:07:21,448
How did you know?

724
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,857
You haven't been to work.
You haven't called the office.

725
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:30,495
You haven't even called me back.
How could you not call me back?

726
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,633
Whatever it is,
I guess you've got your reasons.

727
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:41,398
But I knew you were here, you know?

728
01:07:42,775 --> 01:07:44,003
Somehow...

729
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:46,838
...something pulled me here.

730
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:49,172
I always know when Superman's
in trouble.

731
01:07:49,415 --> 01:07:52,509
Superman?
Something's happened to him?

732
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,981
Everybody's saying that
he's dead but...

733
01:07:56,756 --> 01:08:00,749
...that can't be true, I just know it.
I feel it in my heart.

734
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,618
I think he just needs help.

735
01:08:03,729 --> 01:08:06,562
Wherever he is, Lois,
I'm sure he'll manage.

736
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:10,526
Well, if he can't manage...

737
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:14,599
...and if he really is in trouble...

738
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,106
...then there's a few things
I'd like to tell him.

739
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,647
I'd tell him...

740
01:08:23,716 --> 01:08:27,584
...that I will always cherish
the time we spent together.

741
01:08:28,154 --> 01:08:31,612
And that I never expected
anything in return.

742
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,289
And no matter...

743
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:38,494
...how few minutes I saw him for,
it always made me happy.

744
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:42,363
And I would tell him
that I love him...

745
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:45,237
...and that I'll always love him.

746
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:47,130
And that...

747
01:08:47,773 --> 01:08:48,569
...whatever...

748
01:08:50,009 --> 01:08:52,477
...happens to the world...

749
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,611
...I know that...

750
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:59,710
...he's doing his best to make sure
it's all right for the rest of us.

751
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:01,916
Well, wherever he is, Lois...

752
01:09:02,488 --> 01:09:06,322
...I know that he would
want to thank you.

753
01:09:13,532 --> 01:09:16,262
Listen, I'm pretty tired, you know?

754
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:20,336
So I think I'll just rest here
for a while. Okay?

755
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,138
I'll be fine.

756
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,437
It's okay. Please?

757
01:09:28,948 --> 01:09:31,849
- I hope you feel better, Clark.
- Thanks.

758
01:09:41,227 --> 01:09:46,096
If you do see him, or hear from him...

759
01:09:48,701 --> 01:09:50,396
...he might need this.

760
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,534
Oh, Lex.

761
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:03,908
We're all very pleased at all
the nuclear missiles and arms...

762
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,016
...you've helped us sell...

763
01:10:06,218 --> 01:10:10,120
...and we've decided
to increase your commission.

764
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:13,314
Oh, guys, really, that's great.

765
01:10:14,093 --> 01:10:16,357
It is the least we could do.

766
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:19,194
Well, I had another idea.
Gentlemen...

767
01:10:19,398 --> 01:10:23,198
...I've decided to assume
control of the company.

768
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:33,041
My first official act,
of course, is to say:

769
01:10:33,245 --> 01:10:34,610
"You're fired!"

770
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:37,409
You're mad!

771
01:10:37,616 --> 01:10:39,174
Oh, really?

772
01:10:49,061 --> 01:10:51,586
If you want a reference for work...

773
01:10:51,797 --> 01:10:53,321
...forget it!

774
01:10:56,735 --> 01:10:58,293
That's a good bit.

775
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:03,665
You know with my brains, and your...
Frankly, your...

776
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:07,501
...brawn, the possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

777
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:10,806
You know, I could be president,
emperor, king.

778
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,115
See how scared those guys were?

779
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:15,150
And what do you fear?

780
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:20,924
What? Now? With Superman dead,
and you're on my team?

781
01:11:21,393 --> 01:11:25,693
It's like you're the best power
forward ever. What's to fear?

782
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:43,906
<i>All that remains of</i>
<i>Krypton's energy is yours.</i>

783
01:11:44,683 --> 01:11:46,344
<i>After it is gone...</i>

784
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,010
<i>... you will belong solely</i>
<i>to your new home.</i>

785
01:11:51,357 --> 01:11:55,657
<i>If our dying planet can</i>
<i>save your life, my son...</i>

786
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,163
<i>... we have not died in vain.</i>

787
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:08,364
- Where is the woman?
- You'll never find her.

788
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,466
If you will not tell me,
I will hurt people.

789
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:35,956
Stop! Don't do it, the people!

790
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:35,883
All right, stop! That's enough!

791
01:14:36,288 --> 01:14:37,721
That's enough!

792
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:39,982
You win. I'll take you to her.

793
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:14,256
- Where is she?
- Far away from here and safe.

794
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,991
Don't go in, she's not in there!

795
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,933
We've gotta tone down
these headlines.

796
01:19:20,138 --> 01:19:23,938
Tone down our headlines?
That's all the common man reads!

797
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:29,113
- We can do with less sensationalism.
- Less sensational papers go broke.

798
01:19:29,414 --> 01:19:33,714
I thought I taught you long ago that
the business of newspapers is business.

799
01:19:33,919 --> 01:19:35,079
No, Daddy...

800
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:37,346
...our business is journalism.

801
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,051
We can't keep being
so irresponsible...

802
01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:42,453
...or we'll lead everyone
into disaster.

803
01:19:42,661 --> 01:19:44,652
Don't be overdramatic,
young lady.

804
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:48,026
What kind of disaster could
we possibly help bring about?

805
01:19:50,435 --> 01:19:51,424
Lacy!

806
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:26,028
What's going on? Hey!

807
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:45,316
Are you sure you know what
you're doing, Mr. White?

808
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,778
Well...

809
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,251
Here comes Mr. Warfield.

810
01:21:50,889 --> 01:21:52,880
You better have a good explanation...

811
01:21:53,091 --> 01:21:56,060
...or else you'll be talking
to your lawyers from jail.

812
01:21:56,261 --> 01:21:58,752
You know, I'm not a tycoon.

813
01:21:58,964 --> 01:22:00,727
I'm just an old reporter.

814
01:22:00,932 --> 01:22:03,400
But I've read enough
in my own newspaper...

815
01:22:03,602 --> 01:22:06,662
...about hostile takeovers
at big companies.

816
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:09,635
You, Mr. Warfield, must have
been asleep at the wheel.

817
01:22:09,874 --> 01:22:12,502
Because I've convinced
the bankers of this city...

818
01:22:12,744 --> 01:22:17,010
...that our <i>Daily Planet</i> should be
treated like a natural resource...

819
01:22:17,215 --> 01:22:19,206
...protected from predators.

820
01:22:19,517 --> 01:22:23,578
I convinced them to lend me the money.
I bought the outstanding shares.

821
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:28,521
And you, Mr. Warfield,
are now a minority shareholder.

822
01:22:29,728 --> 01:22:31,059
Everyone, back to work.

823
01:22:31,630 --> 01:22:33,029
Way to tell him, chief!

824
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:38,229
Well, I'm sorry.
You win some and you lose some.

825
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:41,200
Now this is what I call a newspaper.

826
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:43,600
Compliments of <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

827
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,704
- Have a nice day. We did it!
- We're back!

828
01:22:51,483 --> 01:22:53,576
- Hi, am I late?
- Hi, how you doing?

829
01:22:53,785 --> 01:22:57,482
It must've been some effort for
you to drag yourself out of bed.

830
01:22:57,689 --> 01:23:01,181
I'm feeling a lot better.
I had a visit from a good nurse.

831
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:04,726
It must've been good medicine because
she said you were really ill.

832
01:23:04,929 --> 01:23:08,695
Sometimes all you need is loving
attention from the right person.

833
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,595
Glad you're back, Clark.

834
01:23:10,802 --> 01:23:13,862
And remember I am covering
Superman's press conference.

835
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:17,735
- Just tape reactions from the crowd.
- Reactions, okay.

836
01:23:18,343 --> 01:23:19,310
Oh, dear.

837
01:23:19,544 --> 01:23:21,341
Guess I need a tape recorder, huh?

838
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:22,535
- Be right back.
- Clark.

839
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:25,648
Same old Mr. Kent.
He'll never change.

840
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:27,511
I hope not.

841
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,458
- How you doing, Superman?
- Lois, good to see you again.

842
01:23:39,664 --> 01:23:41,325
Good to see you too.

843
01:23:41,533 --> 01:23:42,830
Morning, gentlemen.

844
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:44,428
Excuse me.

845
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:45,833
Thank you.

846
01:23:46,504 --> 01:23:50,167
Once more, we survived the threat
of war and found a fragile peace.

847
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:54,044
I thought I could give you
freedom from war but...

848
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:57,112
...I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

849
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:00,481
We're still a young planet.

850
01:24:01,019 --> 01:24:03,852
There are galaxies out there...

851
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:07,649
...other civilizations for us
to meet, to learn from.

852
01:24:08,259 --> 01:24:10,454
What a brilliant future we could have.

853
01:24:10,729 --> 01:24:13,823
And there will be peace when
the people of the world...

854
01:24:14,032 --> 01:24:15,522
...want it so badly...

855
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:18,897
...their governments will
have to give it to them.

856
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:24,139
I wish you could see the Earth
the way that I see it...

857
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:28,038
...because when you really look
at it, it's just one world.

858
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,877
Do you think he'll find us?

859
01:24:34,085 --> 01:24:37,452
Never. We'll lay low for a while...

860
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:40,886
...a couple of years.
I'll come up with a new plan.

861
01:24:41,626 --> 01:24:44,060
Good thing I bought my drums.

862
01:24:57,776 --> 01:25:00,336
Uncle Lex,
you're not gonna believe this...

863
01:25:00,578 --> 01:25:02,546
...but it's Superman!
- Superman!

864
01:25:07,585 --> 01:25:11,248
- Hey, this rocks!
- Morning, Father.

865
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:14,152
This kid's been under a bad
influence. Can you help?

866
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:17,021
- Every boy can be helped.
- I think you're right.

867
01:25:17,228 --> 01:25:19,219
- Good luck, son.
- Come with me, friend.

868
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:21,557
You wouldn't happen
to have a drum set?

869
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:24,599
Hey, Mozart's back!

870
01:25:29,574 --> 01:25:32,475
- Duane, Mozart's back!
- I see him, Bubba!

871
01:25:34,746 --> 01:25:36,111
Shut up!

872
01:25:37,115 --> 01:25:40,312
- All right, take him away.
- Thank you. Come on, Luthor.

873
01:25:41,152 --> 01:25:44,644
- Just one thing, how did you beat him?
- High school physics.

874
01:25:44,923 --> 01:25:46,914
I had time to figure out...

875
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:50,822
...that if it was born from the sun,
that had to be its energy.

876
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:53,998
- Is the world gonna be vaporized?
- No, Luthor.

877
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:57,430
It's as it always was, on the brink,
with good fighting evil.

878
01:25:57,635 --> 01:25:58,897
See you in 20.
