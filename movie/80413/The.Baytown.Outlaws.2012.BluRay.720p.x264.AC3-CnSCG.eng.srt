1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000


2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000


3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,027
Whoo!

4
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,141
Open up!

5
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,648
It's your dog, bro!

6
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,780
We've got a warrant for a Hector De La Taco.

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,691
So send him on out.

8
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,492
You've got the wrong house, ese.

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,333
Why don't you let me worry about that there, snookum?

10
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,389
This is the FBI! Why the fuck don't you open the fucking door? Let's go!

11
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:27,600
- That's cute.  - Look! You putas got ten seconds to get the fuck off my stoop!

12
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,014
- OK?  - "Putas"?

13
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,274
Hey, man! You know what, man? We got off to the wrong foot!

14
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,185
You're damn fucking right we did!

15
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,147
All right, man! Just take a step back

16
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,926
and take another look at our credentials!

17
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,205
Officer McQueen, would you please show this nice young gentleman your badge?

18
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,532
I can't see shit!

19
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,644
You ain't gonna need this no more.

20
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,411
Stop it! If you had bothered to learn the language,

21
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,288
you know what you could be saying to me right now?

22
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,371
Do you know what you could be saying? You could be saying, "Hey, man,

23
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,913
this is a big mistake. I'm a Federale. I've got a wife!

24
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,878
I got a wife and I got a kid at home! Please don't let me die!"

25
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,929
But that's all you want to do! Talk in your jibber-jabber.

26
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,842
That would be like me going to Mexico and expect everybody to speak American.

27
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,229
God Almighty! I mean, what am I...?

28
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,140
You tell me what I'm supposed to do. What am I supposed to do?

29
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,652
All right, you've got a job. Right? You clean toilets, or cut grass,

30
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,984
or whatever the hell it is you do. This is what I do.

31
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,820
I shoot people in the face. You understand?

32
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,488
Somebody wanted you gone, you know who they came to. This guy right here.

33
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,454
You know? So I'm sorry. But just so you know,

34
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,996
this ain't nothing personal. All right?

35
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,165
You ain't gonna believe this.

36
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,084
Yeah?

37
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,048
We got the wrong house.

38
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,974
This shit ain't gonna turn out well!

39
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,357
You don't listen, man! You're like MacGruber! Goddamnit, man!

40
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,608
Well, ain't that some shit.

41
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,668
- Sheriff?  - What's the story?

42
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,805
It's just an all-out massacre. Thirteen dead bodies, mounds of drugs,

43
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,434
- guns, spit and ass. It's a mess.  - So who were these miscreants?

44
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,220
No one appeared to be anybody special.

45
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,264
Just run-of-the-mill dealers and bangers.

46
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,024
- Anybody talking?  - You know how it is.

47
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,107
Nobody heard nothing, nobody saw nothing, and nobody talks to the po-po.

48
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,692
Yeah, that sounds about right.

49
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,449
Fill out all the necessary paperwork, run the bodies through the county.

50
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,734
Have the report on my desk.

51
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,119
Sir, I also took the liberty to go ahead and put it out over the wire.

52
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,749
See if we can get a bead on these shooters.

53
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,583
- Now, why would you go and do that?  - Trying to speed things along.

54
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:26,504
- Oh, you think I can't do my job.  - I just thought...

55
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,295
Don't do that! Don't ever do that.

56
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,713
Just do as you're told.

57
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:41,186
- Nothing?  - Nope!

58
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,145
Not even half?

59
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:51,068
Something's gotta change! Risking our necks for no money.

60
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,952
This some bullshit!

61
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:58,207
I'm about tired of us getting fucked six ways from Sunday, you hear me?

62
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,040
Goddang, man!

63
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,172
I was gonna put a pool in with that money.

64
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,010
Goddang, motherfucker!

65
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:18,432
Stop! Yeah, walk away, bitch!

66
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,688
You lucky I ain't in the mood to whip your ass, boy!

67
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,520
Wasting food, motherfucker.

68
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,810
- Can I help you?  - Shit!

69
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,111
- Sorry. You scared me.  - That's what I do.

70
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:17,703
I'm Celeste. I was hoping to talk to you and your friends.

71
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:21,115
Friends? I ain't got no friends.

72
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,000
I've got my brothers.

73
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,788
Got my house. My car.

74
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,674
I've got a sexy little chica standing in front of me.

75
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,257
But I ain't got no friends.

76
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,097
You wanna be my friend?

77
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,971
I saw you this morning.

78
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,933
I was hoping to acquire your services.

79
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,067
You got the wrong fellas. We was at church this morning.

80
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,102
- Really?  - Yeah.

81
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,487
So there's just three other white boys that looked just like you

82
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,864
that ripped up a whole house on Bacon Street?

83
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,244
Trying to figure out how you guys walked out of there with all those witnesses.

84
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,531
And every cop in the state isn't lined up at your door.

85
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:15,385
So, what's a pretty little girl like you doing in a neighborhood like that?

86
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,214
- Well, I was there to hire muscle...  - Hire him to do what?

87
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,560
Get my godson back from my ex-husband.

88
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,768
Dibs.

89
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,189
Dang it! Cock-blocking motherfucker!

90
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,653
Lady, I'm not sure what it is you think you're doing,

91
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,744
but that's not exactly our line of expertise.

92
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,626
- I got money.  - How much?

93
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,128
Ten thousand.

94
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,710
Yeah, I don't think saving people is really for us.

95
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,128
You know? Why don't you take that shit to the cops?

96
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,764
They'll do it for free.

97
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,971
Twenty-five thousand.

98
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,183
Five thousand up front.

99
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,290
Come on inside and meet the boys.

100
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,390
This is what I'm talking about. Clean lines, nothing to profile.

101
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,143
None of that spinner, hydraulic shit to get you lit up.

102
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,179
What I'm talking about, Sal, is you transporting anything and everything

103
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,100
in this pre-owned Hyundai Sonata. And here's the reason why.

104
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,067
Hidden compartment. Coated with coffee bean and talcum paste

105
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,403
no drug dog on the planet Earth can sniff out.

106
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,944
This space is worry-free, and this time next month,

107
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,203
I'm gonna have a fucking fleet of them.

108
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,707
- Damn, that's tight.  - Hear that, Dad? It's tight.

109
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,270
So, what do you say, boys? You want to take a few road trips for me?

110
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,670
Abso-fucking-lutely, Carlos.

111
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:24,341
We surely don't mind being your fucking little mule, Don Carlos.

112
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,430
But we gotta talk about our cut.

113
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,934
We're the one doing all the risks.

114
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,815
You know, I just remembered something. I need batteries and toilet paper.

115
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,570
And I need to get that Brad Pitt movie.

116
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,607
The one where he turns back into a fucking baby?

117
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,742
Running low on milk, a few things.

118
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,202
I wonder where I could get all these items in one convenient location?

119
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,996
- Walmart.  - Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

120
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,814
I love the way you put "fucking" in the middle of a word like that.

121
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,251
I'm gonna start using that shit.

122
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,423
You see, guys, I kind of...

123
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:09,469
look at my future empire as the Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

124
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,184
But, you know, we can't all be Sam Walton.

125
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,732
That's my job.

126
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,895
And when my foot soldiers start talking about shit like cuts

127
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,782
and percentages and things like that, well, see, that's partner talk.

128
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,865
And I don't need a partner.

129
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:31,282
I need stockers and cashiers and mercenaries and mules.

130
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,325
And in your case, Padre,

131
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,040
dime-bag dealers from the lawn and garden department.

132
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,581
Coincidentally, where I found you.

133
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,343
Now, Padre, I like you. I really do. I like your son too.

134
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,346
I really appreciate all the shit you've done for me, you know,

135
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,598
that God wouldn't be proud of.

136
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:53,934
But some things, you just have to stop them before they start.

137
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,269
See, partnership leads to ambition.

138
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,855
Ambition leads to a word they don't use much any more.

139
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,609
Mutiny.

140
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,218
- Papa, what's that?  - It's bad news.

141
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,680
Listen up, dipshits! This here is Celeste.

142
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,893
And she'd like to give us an assload of money to kidnap her godkid back

143
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,854
from her deadbeat ex-husband. That about cover it?

144
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,110
- I guess so.  - Well, OK.

145
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,521
Let me just find my missing persons report here,

146
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,066
and I'll get you right set up.

147
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,951
You out your damn mind, brother?

148
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,613
The big fellow over there, that's Lincoln.

149
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,373
The mouthy little faggot here is McQueen.

150
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,159
And I'm Brick.

151
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,752
Did you happen to mention that kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

152
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,541
I was there this morning.

153
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,923
You was at church?

154
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,388
When I saw you guys take out that whole house and walk out without a scratch,

155
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,553
I knew I found my guys.

156
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,518
Bull sheet. What the catch?

157
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,653
Yeah. Why didn't you just go to the cops with this?

158
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,489
His voice box was crushed when he was a kid. He can't talk.

159
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,403
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

160
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,164
Why would he go and do a dumb thing like that?

161
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,120
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

162
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,376
I just want to get Rob and take him away from all this shit.

163
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,289
- That window closes Tuesday night.  - Do we look like FedEx to you?

164
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,424
- Shut up.  - You shut up.

165
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,176
- Shut up, man.  - You shut up.

166
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,007
I'm talking to the lady. Shut up, man!

167
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,296
- Shut up!  - I just want peace of mind.

168
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,181
That's something the cops can't give me.

169
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,264
- And you think we can provide that?  - Yeah.

170
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,082
If he's arrested, he'll just get out in 18 months and hunt me down.

171
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,686
This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

172
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:12,155
It is now. She just gave us 25,000 reasons to open up shop.

173
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,280
Five up front.

174
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,081
Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

175
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,754
It's a chance.

176
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,085
You wanted to be the last true family man, Clark.

177
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,669
OK.

178
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:36,513
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

179
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,438
We'll even get your kid back. But if this man, this...

180
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,351
- Carlos.  - If he's as crazy as you say he is,

181
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,567
then why didn't he just kill you in the first place?

182
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,901
He tried.

183
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,654
So when you leave,

184
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,915
it would be great if Lincoln could put a boot through his skull.

185
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,632
You ladies have any other questions?

186
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,342
Henry, there's someone in the back for you. In your office.

187
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,355
- Who?  - Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

188
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,312
- Cute, too.  - Yeah. Thanks for that.

189
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,648
I'll be sure to freshen up before I go in.

190
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,540
Agent Reese. Henry Millard.

191
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,676
- Pleasure, sir.  - Well...

192
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,677
- We don't see suits in here much.  - Yeah, I can see why.

193
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,390
- How do people move in this heat?  - At our own pace.

194
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,056
So... what can I do you for?

195
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,728
Well, I wanted to ask you a few questions regarding the shootout

196
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,521
that occurred earlier today.

197
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,939
We think we may have a lead on some suspects.

198
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,485
- Is that a fact?  - Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

199
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:23,453
It was a... it's an interesting region you have over here.

200
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,914
It seems every few months there's a large number of violent offenders

201
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,706
that go missing or show up dead, but there's never any leads.

202
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:35,298
Cases just... go away. It's very weird.

203
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,927
Well, I guess around here finding justice for murderers

204
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,717
isn't a top priority.

205
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,561
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers?

206
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,269
I know all, son. But I can see you came prepared for show and tell.

207
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,526
So... get with the getting.

208
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,610
All right. Prime suspects!

209
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,949
Case dating back to their father, Jonathan Warren Oodie,

210
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,706
or Johnny Boy Oodie, as he was called.

211
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,207
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

212
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,837
Apparently, in his mid-twenties, Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

213
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,422
Made things very colorful for local law enforcement back in the day.

214
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,963
Flash-forward, KKK just about dumbed themselves out of existence

215
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,883
and Johnny Boy went out in a blaze of glory

216
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,927
during a federal drug raid in March of '86.

217
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,564
No known mother to speak of, which makes these three a Christmas miracle.

218
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,146
Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?

219
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,529
There were no grandparents or kin suitable to take the children in,

220
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,235
so they were sent into foster care.

221
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:43,074
Then, when they became of age, they started to become everyone's problem.

222
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,365
The oldest is Brick. He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.

223
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,955
Can't seem to stay out of trouble. And boy, does he love his guns.

224
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,793
Then it looks as though they tried to go legit for a minute.

225
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,176
So they put their middle brother, Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.

226
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,429
He ended up killing seven men in the ring. And guess what?

227
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,308
Absolutely nothing was done about it. Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,

228
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:10,314
saying it was accidental and part of his neck-breaking gimmick.

229
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,726
And to make this giant fucker even freakier, he cannot talk.

230
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,065
Or at least he couldn't last time anybody checked.

231
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,526
Wrestled under the name the Dixie Reaper.

232
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,488
And then there's McQueen. Practically illiterate.

233
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,622
He's the baby of the brood. He was well on his way

234
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,450
to becoming a real-life G.I.Joe.

235
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,207
But he's got a bit of an issue with authority.

236
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,587
That's a mighty fine detective job you've done, son.

237
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,796
- Thank you, sir.  - But... it ain't as easy as all that.

238
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,635
- So you do know the Oodie Brothers?  - Like I said, I know all.

239
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,473
I can't just bring them boys in 'cause some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

240
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,183
Well, you can if some suit

241
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,149
from Chicago tells you to.

242
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,862
The longer you stay down here, the more you're going to realize,

243
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,743
we don't like being told what to do, son. Now...

244
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,031
if you'll excuse me, I got other work to attend to.

245
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,452
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking for, you know, a little cooperation.

246
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,711
Once this thing gets wrapped up, I'll get out of your hair.

247
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,601
Why don't you let me worry about my county?

248
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,446
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

249
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,404
I'll drive us until I can't drive no more.

250
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,404
Can you believe she went ahead and paid us five grand up front?

251
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,493
I know, right?

252
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,627
I mean, you'd think she'd have some trust issues, right?

253
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,630
- But hey, each to their own.  - Each to their own, man.

254
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,212
Each to their own.

255
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,922
Now, I know we've got an address to Austin,

256
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,308
but shouldn't she have given us like a picture of the kid or something?

257
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,219
How many kids you reckon they got up there?

258
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,478
I mean, they ain't running a day-care center.

259
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,315
- OK.  - Yeah.

260
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,771
What if we get there and Rob's a baby?

261
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,815
Well, if he's a baby, they got baby junk up there.

262
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,073
- That's smart.  - It's not like they're riding around

263
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,663
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing. I mean, come on.

264
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,826
Besides that, them bullet scars didn't look too fresh on Celeste's belly.

265
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,539
- You're right. You're right.  - Yeah.
263

266
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,017
- What if there's more than one kid?  - Why are you asking me so many

267
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,974
goddamn questions, man? We just went over this! What?

268
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,224
What do you want to know?! What do you want to know?!

269
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,726
- How will we know which is Rob?  - I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

270
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,232
How about that? I'm gonna say, "You know what, I don't want Kevin!

271
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,282
I don't want Michael! No, I don't want Stephen!"

272
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,207
If there's a bunch of fucking kids around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!"

273
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,778
How about that? Fucking hell, man!

274
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,034
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

275
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,572
We smash whoever's in front of us and we take Rob!

276
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,285
Damn! Plain and simple! What? Sorry, Lincoln.

277
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,250
- I don't know why you have to yell...  - Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

278
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,755
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

279
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,588
Where'd you learn that word? Inquisitive?

280
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,926
- Where the fuck did you pick that up?  - It's in my lexicon, man!

281
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,011
- Jackass. Yeah?  - I've got it up here.

282
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,665
There's a lot you don't know about me.

283
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:35,847
Are you ready for a potty break?

284
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,541
How many books you read, motherfucker?

285
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,454
- Where are we?  - We're in Crockett.

286
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,867
Davy Crockett. What time is it?

287
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,081
Four.

288
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,257
Hey.

289
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:13,048
I guess there's a little candy in every pinata.

290
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,930
Got some free shit!

291
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,600
Take it easy, Van Damme! Hey.

292
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,395
Hadji at the front desk said we're only a few hours from Austin.

293
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,064
Nice!

294
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,246
- Who that?  - Fuck. Who do you think?

295
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,874
Don't answer that shit, man!

296
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:25,253
Don't answer it. Don't you...

297
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,459
- Hey.  - Hey?

298
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,876
Don't hey me. The hell are you?

299
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,464
Texas.

300
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,424
Texas?

301
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,198
Well, what in the Sam Hill could you possibly have to do in Texas?

302
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,558
Hey, man. Check this out.

303
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,141
Permian Stadium from Friday Night Lights. It's on the way!

304
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,897
I took a job out here.

305
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,230
You took a job! Well, excuse me.

306
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:53,114
What was I thinking? I forgot you guys are freelance artists. So, Mr Brick,

307
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,571
- what job did you take?  - Look, it's not a big deal, man.

308
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,702
All right? It's just a little gig out here. We can handle it.

309
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,073
You're going to handle it like you handled me yesterday?

310
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,472
It's bad enough you can't check a damn address,

311
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,946
but you also got to lay them pork chops out in my backyard?

312
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,748
- Put it on our tab.  - What was that?

313
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,755
- Nothing!  - You watch your mouth, son.

314
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,213
This ain't a joke. This little misstep is gonna be a pain for me,

315
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,378
but you may have just stuck your dick in a hornet's nest.

316
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,138
What are you talking about? What do you mean?

317
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,218
I've got some jackleg ATF agent up my ass,

318
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,475
looking to make a name for locking up you idiots.

319
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,058
The last thing I need is for you dumb shits to draw more unneeded attention.

320
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:29,442
I mean it, Brick. I better not hear shit about your little Texas job.

321
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,897
Keep your ass off the grid.

322
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,028
Don't call my house. Write this number down.

323
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,941
And for the love of God, get rid of that damn cell phone.

324
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,704
- Yes, sir.  - Damn well better.

325
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,412
You mess around and fuck up my pension, that's your ass.

326
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,043
I don't even know you.

327
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,715
Hey!

328
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,385
Check it out, man! Permian Stadium!

329
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,055
It's on the way, man! You want to win, put bubba in!

330
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,098
It's not on the way, jackass.

331
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,984
It is, man! It's Odessa, Texas!

332
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:30,415
Man! Don't take it out on me because you got your ass chewed.

333
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,330
We got work to do, boys.

334
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,090
I'll get my badge.

335
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,093
No. I figured we'd do the old Roosevelt slammer.

336
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,129
Fuck, yeah...

337
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,057
Dibs, bitch!

338
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:47,221
Goddamn it, Montane! I didn't want you to blow the place to hell and back.

339
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,810
I don't give a shit! Would you fucking listen to me every now and then?

340
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,147
Please? Goddamn it. Come here, baby. Come here!

341
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,313
I don't know if your mama told you, but you are hotter than shit.

342
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,858
Goddamn.

343
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,329
Fuck. That's the shit right there, boys!

344
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,662
From now on, no more nickel and diming!

345
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,168
You get it? Only the finest!

346
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,296
- Hey, how come she's not naked?  - Don't know, boss.

347
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,750
Find out.

348
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,590
Hey. I'll call you when I need you.

349
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,095
All right. Bye.

350
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,644
Doesn't anybody know how to use finesse any more?

351
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,501
You all right?

352
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,794
- The helmet ain't work for shit.  - I told you.

353
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,258
All right, you go east, I go west!

354
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,692
Plain and simple. Smash and grab.

355
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,839
Shit.

356
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,716
My bad, lady. You ok?

357
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,759
In my defense, you do work for an asshole.

358
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,191
You Rob?

359
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,164
Brick!

360
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,828
Goddang. Brick!

361
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,761
Goddamn it.

362
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,764
Fuck.

363
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,769
Shit.

364
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,308
Boss! Boss, are you all right?

365
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,154
What the fuck does it look like, Marty?

366
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,949
It looks like a fucking bomb went off.

367
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,705
Denny?

368
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,038
- What the hell happened?  - The kid.

369
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,671
- Say what?  - Three guys come in.

370
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,708
Yes, I know three guys came in! They came all the fucking way in!

371
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,469
- I see that!  - They took the kid.

372
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,848
Fuck! Goddamn it!

373
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,472
They shot my motherfucking maid!

374
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,770
OK, Marty, I know it's over a year ago,

375
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,781
but I need you to fucking think, OK? You did kill Celeste, right?

376
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,339
You wouldn't lie to me about that shit, would you?

377
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,612
I put three bullets in her gut. She looked dead to me.

378
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,406
But you didn't check to see if she was dead, did you?

379
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,208
Guess not.

380
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,496
That was our golden ticket, you stinking fuck!

381
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,506
How am I going to pay for this? You got the dough?

382
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,007
You got a fucking piggy bank in your fat ass?

383
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,843
Sorry, boss.

384
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,510
OK. As long as you're sorry, I guess that's all that matters, isn't it?

385
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,350
I'll take care of it, boss. I'll make sure it's right. I'll take care of it.

386
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,980
Good, good. Thanks, thanks.

387
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,610
Yeah. Hand me my goddamn pills, will you?

388
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,570
You still want to go look at that car?

389
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,457
That Carlos man make you cripple?

390
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,879
Hi, buddy.

391
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,465
I don't think he can talk.

392
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:39,016
- Well, ain't this some shit, man.  - What?

393
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,055
That he's all, you know...

394
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,142
- Don't do that shit!  - What?

395
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,732
'Cause you're being mean! He can't help it.

396
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,822
You ok?

397
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,325
You hurt?

398
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,829
You ok? He can understand us.

399
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,457
How the hell did you get "I'm ok" from that?

400
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,664
Hey, look, buddy. We ain't going to hurt you, all right? Celeste sent us.

401
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,875
You know Celeste?

402
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:16,136
Yeah! There he goes! See? He understands us just fine.

403
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,768
Once again, how the hell do you know what he's saying?

404
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,428
You the tard whisperer?

405
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,937
You say that again, I'm gonna kill you.

406
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,270
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.  - Say it again. You are making fun.

407
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,186
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.  - You are making fun of him.

408
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,481
It's just a little weird that she didn't mention the poor little fella's

409
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,865
- all buggered up, you know?  - It don't matter.

410
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,619
She sent us to get Rob. We got Rob. All right?

411
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,240
You good, buddy?

412
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,123
- I wasn't being mean.  - You were being mean!

413
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,038
You were making fun of him.

414
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:52,464
Bless his heart. He ain't got no control over that.

415
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,592
It's a damn good thing he wasn't in the living room.

416
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,345
I'm just saying.

417
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,896
Yeah, we can do that.

418
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,955
We can get that done.

419
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,744
All right, Carlos. I'm just finishing up a little something here.

420
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:31,458
Then we'll get on the road. Don't you worry about a thing, sweetie.

421
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,093
Excuse me, councilman.

422
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,612
What? He wanted a bath.

423
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,622
Another one already? I didn't even get off.

424
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,758
- It's for Carlos.  - Well, that makes it a bit better.

425
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,124
Doesn't get much better than this, Bill.

426
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:51,333
It'd be better than this if the fish was biting as well as these chiggers.

427
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,426
You gotta be shitting me.

428
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,929
This is where the real police matters are handled?

429
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,308
You mean on private property? Yeah, sometimes it is.

430
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,593
Anthony Reese, ATF.

431
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,184
- Bill Hawkins. Nice to meet you.  - Bill's a representative for the state.

432
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,190
Nice to meet you, sir.

433
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,065
Bill, have you heard about an investigation going on in our area?

434
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,479
No, I haven't.

435
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,649
It seems Agent Reese was sent down here to check up on us.

436
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,488
Seeing as he's an Ivy League grad,

437
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,782
I guess that makes him better at our jobs than we are.

438
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,995
Is he now?

439
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:30,205
No. I'm not trying to intrude, only assist.

440
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,791
Sheriff, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

441
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,582
We're on the same team. I don't want it to feel like

442
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,876
I'm infringing on your territory. I just...

443
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,761
I really think we have something with these Oodies.

444
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,217
We don't talk business when I'm fishing, son.

445
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,678
When I'm about to cast, don't get hooked!

446
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:52,773
We can, however, talk all about it tomorrow at my office.

447
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,025
It don't excite me that some Yankee's come down here

448
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,358
imposing his authority on one of my best friends.

449
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,737
This county has the lowest crime rate in the state, last time I checked.

450
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,276
I know you democrats

451
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,865
think we need your help,

452
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:10,579
but I'm here to tell you that we don't. Bad enough I've gotta fight you in D.C.

453
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:14,791
Now you can just ease your way out of here the same way you eased in.

454
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,956
I'd like to enjoy what's left of my afternoon.

455
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,882
Alrighty, then.

456
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,051
Why don't you go back home to that wife of yours?

457
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,893
It must be hard raising a baby all by herself.

458
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,979
Yeah! Yeah!

459
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:25,108
- Pretty classy joint you've got here.  - Thanks. Nice shirt.

460
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,782
- You Lucky?  - That's right.

461
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,951
Let's see about that.

462
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,336
Hey, man, why don't you turn that shit off back there for me?

463
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,919
That's Mac. He's 98 years old. I think he's earned the right

464
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,300
to watch a little T and A if he wants.

465
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,838
Why? He ain't jerking nothing.

466
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,302
Yeah, well, he's been watching that stuff since I opened the joint,

467
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,309
so I'm gonna keep it that way, all right?

468
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,436
Well, how about this?

469
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:59,772
If I go back there, I'm gonna bust up Mac and your TV. How about that?

470
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,652
Yeah, is that a fact?

471
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,739
- What the fuck?  - See, I got a minor with me.

472
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:13,201
I'd appreciate it if he wouldn't have to listen to that.

473
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,005
Hey, Mac, I'm gonna give it a rest for a second, all right?

474
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,837
I'm looking for a friend of mine. Terry.

475
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,001
Macky?

476
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,215
I'm gonna give it a rest!

477
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,227
Mac.

478
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,731
Say, Mac. Mac?

479
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,356
It looks like Mac finally had enough.

480
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,646
Hey, man.

481
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,410
Let me guess. This is the part where you say

482
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,789
you'll be back. Am I right?

483
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,497
I'll be back.

484
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,041
You know this movie?

485
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,680
I'll be back.

486
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,610
I'll be back.

487
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,281
Well, ain't you full of surprises?

488
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,482
Hey, this is Lucky. Yeah, listen, I need an ambulance down here, OK?

489
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,359
It seems like Mac's passed on, OK?

490
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:13,822
You got anything to eat back there besides the bar food bullshit?

491
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:18,239
- I have to go get it.  - Well, rustle something up, man.

492
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,158
I need something for the kid, please. We're in a big hurry if you don't mind.

493
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,247
Yeah? You running from something?

494
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,343
Goddamn.

495
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,822
How's it going, ladies? Need something to drink?

496
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,484
Don't know what we'd like yet.

497
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,780
All right. Well, you let us know when you do.

498
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,618
Looking real good up in here.

499
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,792
Watch this.

500
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,141
Dibs.

501
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,197
Name's McQueen.

502
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,903
What's your name?

503
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,536
Can I buy you a drink?

504
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:44,371
Her name is Jez. And you can buy us a drink.

505
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:50,290
Lucky? Can I get us some beers for my new friend Jez.

506
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,800
And her ladies. And that kid's still waiting on his food.

507
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,881
I'll be right back.

508
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,221
Figure it out.

509
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:10,275
What's your story? And I'm gonna pretend I'm listening.

510
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,607
Damn bullshit! Don't want the kid seeing porn,

511
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,193
but when some sweet tail walks in, they forget all about that, right?

512
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,362
First time in four years I got some sweet, fresh snapper come in here,

513
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,952
and I'm down here making fucking sandwiches for the road warriors?

514
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:26,582
Kiss my fucking ass!

515
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,715
Wanna dance?

516
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:45,143
About damn time.

517
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,725
Not like that.

518
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,025
Not like that either.

519
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,489
Brick?

520
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,703
Is that the Big Whopper or the Ponytail?

521
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,289
By the way, Marty says hi.

522
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,922
Yeah? Well, tell Marty, "Fuck you." I see you dodged another bullet.

523
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,457
How'd you get this number?

524
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:19,173
These days, baby, I can get just about anything I want to.

525
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,341
For instance, right now I'm getting back my paycheck on wheels

526
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:27,682
- from those amateurs you sent.  - Moneygrubbing piece of shit!

527
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,142
What happened to us, baby? We were good once, weren't we?

528
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,650
Fuck you! We were never good. I got played and that's that.

529
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,530
Hang on a second. Anybody got played, it was me.

530
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,657
I thought I had a bitch that was down with this shit.

531
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,785
You killed his parents, you psycho!

532
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,447
And it makes me sick that I brought you into their world!

533
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,831
Don't you think they're just a bad judge of character?

534
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,992
It ain't my fault all your friends are richer than shit.

535
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,538
And you know something? At the end of the day, I think you knew.

536
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,753
If I knew, I would have lit your gutless ass on fire while you slept!

537
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,919
Now, there's the feisty bitch I know!

538
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,930
I wish it hadn't ended up the way it did.

539
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,344
But what's Clyde gonna do if Bonnie crosses him and goes soft?

540
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,979
And besides, what does that son of a bitch need money for?

541
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,608
I mean, how much can a wheelchair cost? Two or three hundred dollars?

542
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,395
You lost, motherfucker! Rob's coming back with me. Deal with it.

543
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:24,201
Now, girlie, obviously you didn't learn the first time around.

544
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,782
Let me tell you how this shit's gonna end.

545
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,784
I sent some really awful bitches to handle this situation.

546
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,874
Now, once they track down your fellas, it's not gonna be a bloodbath.

547
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,130
It's gonna get fucking sexy.

548
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,305
# Take this gun off of my head, it's turning red #

549
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:46,094
They'll single them out, divide them up, then thin the herd.

550
00:44:46,094 --> 00:45:03,094
# Will you kill me dead, or kiss me instead. #

551
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:12,394
# Take me out or take me back. #

552
00:45:13,394 --> 00:45:20,394
# Make it red, make it black. #

553
00:45:21,394 --> 00:45:31,604
# Take these snakes out of my bed, they're turning red. #

554
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,595
Each one will have forgotten about everything,

555
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,481
except for the fine piece of strange grinding on them.

556
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:42,594
# Make it red, make it black. #

557
00:45:43,594 --> 00:45:56,128
# Take these snakes out of my bed, they're turning red. #

558
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,246
Then, without warning, their lives will be snuffed out

559
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:04,338
and the girls deliver Rob just in time for me to plan the boy's 18th birthday.

560
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,423
You should have stayed dead, darling.

561
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,636
Cause unless your name is Jesus, you had no business coming back.

562
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,676
See you soon.

563
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:25,676
# Will you kill me dead, or kiss me instead. #

564
00:46:29,676 --> 00:46:34,094
# Take me out or take me back. #

565
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:41,094
# Make it red, make it black. #

566
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,020
Why don't you try a taste of me!

567
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,206
Well, hi, big guy. Here's my boom stick.

568
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,508
# If you kill me dead #

569
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,294
Shit!

570
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:43,976
Hey! Hey, don't be fucking around up there!

571
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:52,976
# Make it red, make it black. #

572
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,220
Fuck!

573
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:31,193
Well, those ones were the longest relationship I ever had.

574
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,365
You OK, bud?

575
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,202
All right, come on. Wanna move. Let's go.

576
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,960
Lucky's about to get lucky up in this motherfucker.

577
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:54,095
Do this shit right. I'm gonna do it all night.

578
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,256
I've got to pay to play...

579
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,802
Five girls like that come in there, you've got to pay to play.

580
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,265
That pussy ain't free.

581
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,640
Don't you laugh at me. I'm gonna make you work all this,

582
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,606
all this extra weight off me, because all I've been doing

583
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,440
is eating fried chicken, baby, and fried collards!

584
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,948
Fried! Everything fried! I saw a man fry a Twinkie yesterday.

585
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:18,077
Hill County officials have these renderings to go on.

586
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,113
Baby, let me call you right back.

587
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,781
The assailants are travelling with a minor,

588
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,042
and appear to be highly dangerous. If you see anyone

589
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,170
fitting this description, please contact the local authorities.

590
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,923
- I'll be a motherfucker.  - Back to you with the weather, Bob.

591
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,720
That sexy bitch broke her damn heel off in my back.

592
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,261
- What in the hell was that?  - I don't know.

593
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:45,647
But you can bet I'm gonna call Celeste and find out.

594
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,229
Rambo time.

595
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,510
Now, you ain't gonna get me back for this later?

596
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,341
Promise me now.

597
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,808
Cause I've got a feeling this is gonna hurt.

598
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:28,102
- He's taking it, man.  - Take it like Drago!

599
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,640
Drago.

600
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:34,654
Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago!

601
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:42,241
- Yeah, baby!  - Man! She got you good!

602
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:52,581
Hill County officials have these renderings to go on.

603
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,750
Eyewitness accounts say the assailants are travelling with a minor

604
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:59,216
and appear to be highly dangerous. If you see anyone

605
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,724
- fitting this description, please...  - Fuck me!

606
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,059
Hey!

607
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,727
They did a really good job, didn't they? It looks just like them too.

608
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,522
Look at that. It was all over the news.

609
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,193
Sheriff, this is the first time that evidence

610
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,579
has literally been brought to my doorstep.

611
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:29,117
We were able to pick up an address for them, too.

612
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,536
I'll have a search and seizure here by noon.

613
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,751
And surprise, surprise!

614
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,256
It's located on a piece of residential land

615
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:40,671
here in your county, Sheriff. Can you believe that?

616
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,761
That sounds like a hell of a plan, son. What can I do to help?

617
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,643
Well, I'm guessing half the roads that get me there won't show up on my GPS.

618
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:51,932
So if you could do me a favor and simply escort me to the property,

619
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,602
that would be fantastic.

620
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:01,988
You mean that old-ass condemned shack out on Euleton?

621
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:06,246
Son, you didn't hear? Fire chief let the volunteers burn that up for training.

622
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,782
- Burn it up for training.  - Yeah.

623
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,952
Yeah, I think it was scheduled for early this morning.

624
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,087
Is that right?

625
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,438
- Well, I suggest you better stop them.  - I could call Chief Walters,

626
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,466
but I'm pretty sure ain't nothing left out there but smoke and ash.

627
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,178
My! I'm really sorry about that.

628
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:28,969
It really sounded like you had something there

629
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:36,817
Motherfucker, I'm done with you wasting my time.

630
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,604
I don't ever remember asking for it.

631
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,944
This good-old-boy justice thing you got going on,

632
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,200
letting the trash take out the trash, saving tax dollars

633
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,783
by keeping the bottom feeders out of the system

634
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,199
so you can just go fishing all day,

635
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,459
that's a slippery slope you're playing on.

636
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:56,429
It's gotten to the point where you're no better than they are, Sheriff.

637
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,125
Yeah, I'd be careful if I was you.

638
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,968
Well, I'll take that under advisement.

639
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,513
Shit.

640
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,967
Wake up.

641
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,756
Go get Rob something to eat. I'm gonna call Celeste.

642
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,828
Found the mother lode, boy!

643
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:24,213
I'm gonna pay for it. Don't worry. God.

644
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,931
You see, man, when you open up something in the store...

645
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,980
you have to pay for it.

646
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,527
No one taught me that when I was young.

647
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,778
I learnt that one the hard way.

648
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,946
From the cops.

649
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,786
What?

650
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,006
What's wrong, man?

651
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,503
I don't know you mean by all that squirming.

652
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,389
Help me out, bud. What you need? What you need?

653
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,018
You got to take a piss?

654
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,065
You're hungry. Goddamn, of course you're hungry!

655
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:26,401
Let's get you something to eat? OK. Let's go.

656
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,484
Man!

657
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,906
It's like working out a riddle every time talking to this boy.

658
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,287
Morning, sunshine! You know,

659
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,415
I... I don't remember crazy-ass biker chicks being involved in our deal.

660
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,374
I don't remember leaving Carlos alive in the deal either. Is Rob all right?

661
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,334
Fuck!

662
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,800
Yeah, he's pRobably scared half to death, but he's fine.

663
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,330
- Let me talk to him.  - He's inside getting something to eat with McQueen.

664
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,054
Besides, you and I got something to talk about.

665
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,984
All right? What the hell was that last night?

666
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,685
I told you, Carlos would try to get Rob back if you didn't kill him.

667
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,472
What are you talking about? We killed every motherfucker in that place.

668
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,232
Well, evidently not, Brick!

669
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,564
All right. Why would a guy like Carlos, what would he want to do

670
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,149
with a kid in Rob's condition?

671
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:12,942
Carlos killed Rob's parents, and then lied to me about it.

672
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,703
That might have been something you wanted to mention.

673
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,705
All right, look. I'm sorry.

674
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,959
Rob has a trust that matures when he's 18,

675
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:26,839
and as legal guardians, we would get him and eventually the money.

676
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:31,253
That too might be something that you wanted to mention! Fuck!

677
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:36,175
Rob's trust matures next week and... Carlos will do anything to get it.

678
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,889
- Brick, you're all he's got.  - All right. New plan.

679
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:44,022
- You meet us halfway.  - Fine. Where?

680
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,936
Vicksburg, Mississippi. Big Bayou Campground.

681
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,647
I'll be there as soon as I can.

682
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:56,410
And if you lie to me again, Carlos will be the least of your worries.

683
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,572
I already dropped five bitches. I won't hesitate to make it six.

684
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,964
Now, you may have heard of pig in a blanket,

685
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,595
but this here is a pig in the sun.

686
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:23,346
You want hair on your chest, now, don't you? Strippers like it.

687
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,436
Hand me a napkin, man.

688
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,197
You all right?

689
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,280
Hey. Don't worry.

690
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:44,701
Don't worry, man. Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

691
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,494
He's OK.

692
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,914
Believed to be responsible for the shooting

693
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,298
in a rural Texas bar,

694
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,130
they are travelling with a disabled young man and believed to be

695
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,719
armed and dangerous. Do not approach these men if you see them.

696
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,392
Who wants a Snicker bomb?

697
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,649
Think you can kidnap some kid and get away with it?

698
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,201
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math, five whore assassins

699
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,867
can't trump three retards and a fucking cripple.

700
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,627
I mean... well, according to my calculations,

701
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,879
they should be in your area someplace by now.

702
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,211
But that's not my fucking job to figure out, is it?

703
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:36,377
I mean, isn't owning the road your goddamn job?

704
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,671
That's what I thought. OK.

705
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,432
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do. Just get my boy back.

706
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,592
Yes! Get it done!

707
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,569
- Yeah?  - We're in a world of shit down here.

708
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,446
Yeah, and now it's spilling over into mine.

709
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,323
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg, Mississippi. OK?

710
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,657
- Big Bayou Campground. We could...  - Stop. Stop! Shut up!

711
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:05,198
Just shut the fuck up! The less I know, the better.

712
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,788
- I taught you better than this!  - Look, I just thought that if...

713
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,669
you know, we could run in and do a quick...

714
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:15,379
Don't do that! Don't get ideas! Just do what the fuck I say!

715
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,793
Things ran smooth when we did that, didn't it?

716
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,720
I cleaned up your shit, you took care of mine.

717
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,973
I could have handled this hotshot.

718
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:25,726
But now this shit has gone public.

719
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,638
There's repercussions to working for yourself.

720
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,898
- About time you learned that.  - Meaning what?

721
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,983
I got to cut ties, Brick. I cleaned up everything on my end.

722
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:39,114
So, what you do from now on rests solely on your shoulders.

723
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:43,278
If you come back here, I got no choice but to put you down.

724
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,071
I got a family to protect.

725
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,917
I'll be sure to let the boys know that we're on our own again.

726
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,082
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

727
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,637
Brick! We gots to go!

728
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,768
We made the news!

729
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:22,074
Hood Pirates! Mount up!

730
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,301
Give me that!

731
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:53,434
- You call Millard?  - Yeah.

732
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,104
Well, what did he say?

733
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,998
The suspects in question are believed to be.

734
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,447
- Brick Oodie and his two brothers...  - Nothing.

735
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,904
They hail from the Atmore area, located in Montgomery, Alabama.

736
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,116
They drew you to look like a fag. Look at that.

737
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:11,248
What the fuck you do that for, man?

738
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,423
- What the fuck, man?  - Come on! Come on?

739
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:21,629
- What are you do...  - Come on!

740
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,464
I ain't gonna fucking hurt you, you little faggot!

741
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,130
- Stop, man!  - Come on! Come here!

742
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:27,719
Want some? You want some?

743
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:31,261
- Fuck!  - What the devil got into you?

744
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,348
I fucked us.

745
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,736
How you mean?

746
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:46,197
Let's see. Millard won't have anything to do with us any more

747
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,657
cause he can't clean up that mess with the biker chicks down at the bar.

748
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,539
So now we can't go back to Bama.

749
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,701
And all of them son of bitches we mowed down in Austin.

750
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,962
- Guess what we missed.  - Carlos.

751
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,880
And he ain't gonna stop neither. He's already tracked down Celeste.

752
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:08,218
So now we gotta get him to fucking Vicksburg so they can disappear.

753
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,092
Well...

754
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,806
This is getting better by the minute.

755
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:21,019
Now, I like that little fella just as much as anybody.

756
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:28,739
But tell me something. Just give me one reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

757
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,825
They ain't got no other options.

758
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,161
Hell, we ain't got no other options either.

759
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:40,838
I mean, look at us. We can't even take care of ourselves.

760
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,627
Has it ever crossed your mind

761
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:47,086
that maybe he stands a better chance without us?

762
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,886
- It's just different.  - How's this different?

763
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,552
- It's just different!  - How the fuck is it different?

764
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,558
We had a brother...

765
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,854
who passed away before you can even remember.

766
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,236
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

767
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,240
He was all buggered up, and he was in a wheelchair.

768
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,779
Daddy beat his ass every single day. Treated him like a dog.

769
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:17,826
And there's nothing we could do about it. Different.

770
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,463
Well, he gets a pass. I don't understand why you didn't say nothing.

771
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,224
- How come you never said nothing?  - What do you want me to say to you?

772
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,431
I'm sorry, all right?

773
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,848
But ever since I've seen this fella, I can't stop thinking about it.

774
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,358
How'd he die?

775
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,529
- How'd he die?  - I don't know.

776
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,867
He was there one day and gone the next.

777
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,501
I asked Daddy about it one time, but that went over like a fart in church.

778
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,843
What was his name?

779
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,770
- They never named him.  - Fuck me.

780
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,210
Got them bitches! Dead ahead!

781
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:57,220
And this time, try not to hit the motherfucking baby.

782
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:02,892
Here they come!

783
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,433
I'm giving it all she's got.

784
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,944
Monaco ain't got nothing left! Strap in Rob! Here they come, boys!

785
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,105
What the hell is this motherfucker?

786
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,951
Hey, Rottweiler! You better back the fuck up, mutt!

787
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,998
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

788
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,461
The kid's in the back!

789
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,604
They took the kid! I thought I told you to strap him in!

790
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,621
They took the fucking door, man! I really don't think a fucking seatbelt

791
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,567
would have mattered right now! Go!

792
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,295
- Hey, he all right?  - How in the fuck do I know?

793
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,751
Here they come! Just like you said!

794
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:16,465
Hey! Help the driver. You want to see this.

795
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,971
We're about to fuck your babysitters up.

796
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,733
- Come on, boy!  - Come on!

797
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,151
Welcome to the South, motherfuckers!

798
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:43,330
What you got now, bitches?!

799
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,874
Time out, bitch!

800
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:08,021
No. No, indeed. Hell no.

801
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,307
- Do something, you're the brains!  - We've gotta figure something out!

802
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,101
What?!

803
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,528
- Top rope!  - Top rope!

804
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,579
Motherfuckers!

805
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,915
Get them, Lincoln! Come on!

806
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,427
Go get 'em!

807
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,558
They're slowing down! They're slowing down!

808
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,475
Come on.

809
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,273
Lincoln!

810
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,045
We're good!

811
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,257
You all right, buddy?

812
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:28,226
You're one crazy redneck.

813
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:39,855
Trying to be a tough guy? Running away from us?

814
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,152
You want one of these? You've earned it.

815
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:49,824
- How's Linc?  - Not so good.

816
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,833
- What?  - You better check on him.

817
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:53,914
You got Rob'?

818
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,124
Fuck.

819
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,424
You do all this?

820
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,514
By God.

821
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,394
It ain't your hat, bitch.

822
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:19,361
Good work!

823
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,771
Let me take a look.

824
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,940
Come on. Let me see it.

825
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,286
Shit!

826
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,741
Well, I think it's safe to say that,

827
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:37,083
that surpasses McQueen's level of doctoring.

828
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,631
- Fine.  - You are not fine.

829
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:43,214
We need to get that looked at.

830
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,426
- Fine.  - All right. You're fine.

831
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,550
Fine, my ass.

832
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,940
Fuck!

833
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,240
McQueen!

834
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:26,177
Montane! Montane, where the fuck are you?

835
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:30,848
Shit.

836
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,149
Goddamn it!

837
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,193
Hey, you guys need a ride?

838
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,956
Who are these fucking people?!

839
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,921
Nah, man. We're good. Just keep going.

840
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,344
Son of a bitch.

841
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:12,553
He practically made these monsters, then hung them out to dry.

842
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,264
You gotta be kidding me.

843
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,355
And why aren't they working for me?!

844
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:25,654
Just get in the car. I'm a nurse. I can help.

845
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,359
That ain't such a bad idea.

846
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,988
Bingo.

847
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,996
What happened here?

848
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,496
- I did that.  - The stabbing or the stitches'?

849
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,288
- The stitches.  - Infection is setting in.

850
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,174
I poured whiskey on it.

851
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,255
Let me guess, you saw that in a movie?

852
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:51,091
Yeah. Several.

853
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,652
Hey-Hey, Rob?

854
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:10,149
You hold onto that, all right'? You know that's his prize possession.

855
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,660
He's gonna need it when he gets to feeling better, OK?

856
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:22,202
Chogan, this is Carlos. I'm only calling as a last damn resort.

857
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,792
Some asshole took Rob and I need you to kill him.

858
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:27,326
If you can, bring me back the kid, and if not, then fuck it.

859
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,584
If I can't have him, nobody can.

860
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,385
They're close.

861
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,345
Finish up!

862
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,943
He gonna be all right?

863
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,451
Like I said, it's up to you.

864
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,329
You look really familiar.

865
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,586
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

866
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,748
Do you stay in shitty motels? 'Cause we clean them.

867
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,758
Crockett. That's where I've seen you.

868
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,973
Small world.

869
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,434
So why ain't you a nurse?

870
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:25,899
- Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.  - Why don't you become legal?

871
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,776
Your country doesn't make it that easy for us.

872
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,067
What are you talking about?

873
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,773
Just go down to the place and fill out your paperwork.

874
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,784
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal. I mean, you speak the language.

875
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:39,821
That's more than most of them do out here.

876
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,115
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

877
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,411
Yeah, well, I might be just an ignorant redneck,

878
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:48,876
but at least I know who I am.

879
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:54,052
I mean, you're a nurse. You ought to be helping people.

880
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,337
Not scrubbing toilets.

881
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:02,352
Well, is that why you do what you do? Cause it's who you are?

882
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,726
Let's just say it runs in the family. You know?

883
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:13,647
Well, you're not gonna have much family left at this place.

884
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:24,540
Listen, I really appreciate everything you've done for us.

885
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,873
I can't say that I'd exactly done the same thing, so...

886
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,002
You're welcome.

887
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:38,255
What would you say if... if I offered you two grand

888
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:40,014
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi?

889
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:48,231
What do you say I convince you not to do what you're about to do?

890
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,689
I could take you anywhere else.

891
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:58,492
Nah. This here's one of them kind of deals, you know?

892
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:06,666
We kind of had people controlling what we do our whole lives, you know?

893
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,999
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

894
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:04,136
- Please keep the kid safe for me.  - Nothing bad's gonna happen.

895
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:08,599
- We've just got a job to finish.  - I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

896
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,442
- Thank you.  - See ya.

897
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,571
See you around.

898
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,917
Can we still put a pool in with three grand?

899
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:35,629
What you thinking?

900
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,044
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

901
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,133
But it's gonna be tough with just two of us.

902
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,717
What you mean two?

903
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:56,771
That's fitting.

904
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,485
- You want to go high?  - No.

905
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,586
You go and run in the house.

906
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:25,555
No matter what you hear, no matter what the people say,

907
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:30,218
Papa did what he could to make things better for you than he had. OK?

908
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,512
Go. Run along.

909
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:43,319
Dispatch told me you'd... you'd be here.

910
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,326
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea, but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

911
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,329
It might be too strong for you.

912
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:58,080
You know, of all the Southern idioms and charms,

913
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:02,091
you know which one I find the most helpful?

914
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,002
My extraordinary hospitality'?

915
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:09,516
The fact that nobody ever throws anything away.

916
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,386
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

917
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:19,310
There was nothing in any database that ever connected you to them.

918
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:24,363
Well, no computer files back in the day.

919
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,446
Another perk of Alabama being behind the times.

920
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,327
Paper trail easy as hell to get rid of.

921
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:33,031
Only thing this proves is that a young deputy was doing his job.

922
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,834
Right, right, right. Well, I figured you'd say that,

923
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:43,046
so I did a little further digging, and I found this.

924
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,880
You missed some paper, Henry.

925
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:50,632
You signed for $1,200 dollars on May 26th, 2005,

926
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:53,141
$800 June 15th, 2007,

927
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,895
$1,100 on February 3rd, 2008.

928
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:58,147
And it goes on and on and on.

929
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:01,400
That money was issued for crime scene clean up.

930
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:04,983
And I can hire anybody I damn well please.

931
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:08,900
Well, since when do people get paid to clean up a crime before it happens?

932
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:15,661
You are right though, Sheriff.

933
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,622
You've got the lowest crime rate in the state.

934
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:23,464
You certainly weren't paying them much though, were you'?

935
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:26,467
It's no wonder those dogs turned on you.

936
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:33,012
Now, listen. This story, you know, could end one of two ways.

937
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,722
You could either help me out, cooperate...

938
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,268
or I could just arrest you on the spot.

939
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,729
Take them down myself, eventually.

940
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,823
Look, either way, I've got to take you to prison,

941
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:50,909
but you play nice, I'll see to it that your sentence is shortened.

942
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:54,446
Maybe one day you'll be able to see your granddaughter graduate from high school.

943
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,924
Let's consider it a professional courtesy.

944
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,091
They get big quick on you.

945
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,936
You'll find that out sooner or later.

946
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,233
- Come with me.  - No, no, no. Come on.

947
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,694
- I don't think so.  - Cut that shit out.

948
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:33,200
Fighting's a young man's game.

949
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:40,954
- Where are you going?  - Vicksburg.

950
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:44,541
If anybody's gonna put an end to this, it's going to be me.

951
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,842
You know, I'm the one that ain't supposed to be trusting you.

952
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,219
You all won the damn war.

953
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:04,566
Now this is the same face paint that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

954
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,937
Solidifies you as one of us.

955
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:16,364
You scared?

956
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:21,369
You're an Oodie now. You got to swallow that fear.

957
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,042
For what it's worth,

958
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,713
I think you deserve more than what you've been through.

959
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,053
It ain't right, people taking advantage of you

960
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,185
just because you can't help yourself.

961
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:47,817
I know you may not have had a lot of people in your life you can look up to.

962
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:53,899
Hell, I ain't telling you to look up to us.

963
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:01,698
I just want you to know that we're going to do everything we can

964
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,240
to keep you from getting hurt.

965
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,927
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

966
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,006
My new lookout.

967
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,389
You've been promoted.

968
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,626
Empty...

969
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:06,770
- That ain't much.  - It's gonna have to do.

970
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,192
Lincoln don't look so good.

971
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,156
Yeah, he's been better.

972
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,164
Hey.

973
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:29,828
You think she's gonna come and see this thing through?

974
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,837
Or is she just gonna run for the Hills?

975
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,424
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

976
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,427
Yeah.

977
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:49,355
Why you reckon God would make someone like him?

978
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:53,063
What?

979
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:57,647
Why would God let something be wrong with him like that?

980
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:07,658
I don't know. Hell, man, I don't know.

981
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,546
Hell, why you asking me that, man?

982
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,343
I don't know. Just been thinking about it.

983
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:25,516
I don't ask why God made men like him.

984
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,847
I wonder why he made men like us.

985
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:06,845
How are the boys?

986
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,064
All right.

987
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,192
Hey, Brick?

988
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,735
I'm starting to think we should have finished school.

989
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,988
At least junior high.

990
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:48,344
It's almost over, bud.

991
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,532
- Shit!  - McQueen!

992
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,124
A fucking arrow, man? Fuck!

993
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,602
Come on!

994
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,692
Go!

995
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,226
Move your ass, woman!

996
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,863
- Shit.  - Where's Rob, Brick?

997
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,577
He's safe!

998
01:26:57,838 --> 01:26:59,598
Stay right here. I've gotta go get some ammo.

999
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:00,692
- No! I'm going with you.  - Stay here!

1000
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:03,208
- I'm going with you!  - Fuck!

1001
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,175
- Come on, man!  - Go!

1002
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:16,683
- Grab a gun. Fuck.  - Take me to fucking Rob!

1003
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:18,268
You're keeping your ass here!

1004
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,185
That was a fucking arrow, man!

1005
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,864
Brick!

1006
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:34,825
Brick!

1007
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,083
Time out, motherfucker! This ain't fun no more! Stop!

1008
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:42,497
Fuck me! Shit.

1009
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:05,768
I told you to fucking stay here!

1010
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:07,021
You're really gonna say I told you so right now?

1011
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,610
You mind yourself, woman!

1012
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,151
Shit!

1013
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:18,707
God!

1014
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,799
- Don't fucking move!  - Come out, come out.

1015
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,590
What you gonna do with that?

1016
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:34,886
- McQueen!  - Hey!

1017
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,346
Hey! Hey!

1018
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:57,280
You're about to have a bad day, John Redcorn.

1019
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,256
Remind me again who's gonna have a bad day?

1020
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,246
Ain't that a sight.

1021
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:38,635
So... you and your brothers kidnapped the kid from...

1022
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,766
from Ms Martin, and you were planning on holding him for ransom?

1023
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:46,022
- Yeah? All right.  - That's what I said.

1024
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,855
And what about these other men here? Who are they?

1025
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,575
All right. All right.

1026
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:01,545
You'll have plenty of time to think about your answers in prison. Yeah?

1027
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:14,466
- Agent Reese?  - Special Agent Simmons! Hey!

1028
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,752
- Nice work.  - Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1029
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,843
I'm very impressed with how you navigated these waters.

1030
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,599
I'm putting in a request to have you take over this territory.

1031
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:25,181
- No, no, no, no, sir...  - Don't worry about the details.

1032
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:28,313
We'll get everything handled. Cover the moving expenses and everything.

1033
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,644
- But my wife...  - It's a fine place to raise a family.

1034
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:33,443
- Sir... I...  - I'm sure she'll love it.

1035
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:37,648
Fuck me.

1036
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,988
Hey! Fuck me!

1037
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:48,117
Hey, bud!

1038
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:52,705
I just wanted to say thank you. I'm sorry it came down to all this.

1039
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:55,715
Don't mention it.

1040
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,920
Just make sure you take care of this little guy.

1041
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,306
He's one tough cuss.

1042
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:09,229
Sorry we didn't get the fucker.

1043
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:11,857
That's all right. Carlos will get his.

1044
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:21,572
Hey, man, you think I could have a minute? I ain't going nowhere.

1045
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:23,486
All right.

1046
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,661
Hey, stop that.

1047
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,254
You're an Oodie now.

1048
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:41,170
Make sure this shit didn't go down for nothing.

1049
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:43,429
Yeah.

1050
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,304
Thank you.

1051
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:57,194
Well, ain't that some E.T. shit?

1052
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,778
You know Brick's gay, right?

1053
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,949
See ya, Rob.

1054
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,626
The hits just keep on coming.

1055
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:31,554
No matter how this thing plays out...

1056
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,316
I'm proud of you boys.

1057
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:50,240
You busy? Goddamn it!

1058
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,492
Is there anything I can get you?

1059
01:33:57,257 --> 01:34:00,170
- What?  - I have a package for Carlos Lyman.

1060
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,050
- Please sign here.  - I ain't signing shit.

1061
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,506
- Just give me the package.  - Are you all right, sir?

1062
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,341
Yeah, I'm fine. It's none of your goddamn business.

1063
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:08,007
- You have to sign.  - Isn't that great?

1064
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:12,473
The fucking Postal Service is concerned with my goddamn wellbeing.

1065
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:27,951
This better be a box full of fucking cash.

1066
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,116
You bitch!

1067
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:52,116


1068
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:03,229
What was that letter they gave you?

1069
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:05,522
Some work release bullshit, I...

1070
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,236
No.

1071
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:18,248
"Brick. I told you I'd settle up. The truck's from Rob."

1072
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:21,288
Come to find out, more people could use your help.

1073
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:24,959
"Check the bed and enjoy the toys. Celeste."

1074
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,511
What truck?

1075
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:34,551
Damn!

1076
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:49,232
I guess somebody forgot to tell me

1077
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,401
it was motherfucking Halloween in the South today.

1078
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,536
That Asian one.

1079
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:57,373
Pink eyeliner on.

1080
01:35:57,543 --> 01:36:00,956
I've got something pink, and I'm swinging it real low.

1081
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,997
Swinging it real low. I don't wanna hear any goddamn lip.

1082
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:09,295
It's a fucking bar. You want some McDonald's, go to McDonald's.

1083
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,837
Make me a sandwich!

1084
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:13,757
I don't give a fuck what it is as long as he just get to eat.

1085
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:16,597
Hey, shaggy! Come on get the...

1086
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,531
We're gonna walk in here and cause some shit!

1087
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:23,183
Get the fuck out of here, you dumb, backwards-talking,

1088
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,352
motherfucking Sling Blade-ass motherfucker.

1089
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,238
If my brother was here, you wouldn't be talking that bullshit to me.

1090
01:36:28,408 --> 01:36:30,900
I'll fucking kill your ass and fuck Mac.

1091
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:35,366
