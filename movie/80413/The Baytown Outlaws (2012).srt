1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,206
Whoo!

2
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,309
Open up!

3
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:52,771
It's your dog, bro!

4
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,904
We've got a warrant
for a Hector De la Taco.

5
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:58,860
So send him on out.

6
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:07,628
You've got the wrong house, ese.

7
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:11,457
Why don't you let me worry about
that there, snookum?

8
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:21,491
This is the FBI! Why the fuck don't you
open the fucking door? Let's go!

9
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:27,590
That's cute. Look! You putas got ten
seconds to get the fuck off my stoop!

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,162
- OK?
- Putas?

11
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,421
Hey, man! You know what, man?
We got off to the wrong foot!

12
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:34,356
You're damn fucking right we did!

13
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,318
All right, man! Just take a step back

14
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:39,999
and take another look
at our credentials!

15
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:46,274
Officer McQueen, would you please show
this nice young gentleman your badge?

16
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,715
I can't see shit!

17
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,184
Whoo!

18
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,784
You ain't gonna need this no more.

19
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:07,540
Stop it! If you had bothered
to learn the language,

20
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,463
you know what you could
be saying to me right now?

21
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,500
Do you know what you could be saying?
You could be saying, "Hey, man,

22
00:04:12,776 --> 00:04:16,987
this is a big mistake.
I'm a Federale. I've got a wife!

23
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:20,007
I got a wife and I got a kid at home!
Please don't let me die!"

24
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:26,014
But that's all you want to do!
Talk in your jibber-jabber.

25
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,940
That would be like me going to Mexico
and expect everybody to speak American.

26
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:33,336
God Almighty! I mean, what am I...?

27
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,282
You tell me what I'm supposed to do.
What am I supposed to do?

28
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:39,760
All right, you've got a job. Right?
You clean toilets, or cut grass,

29
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:43,104
or whatever the hell it is you do.
This is what I do.

30
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:45,964
I shoot people in the face.
You understand?

31
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:50,551
Somebody wanted you gone, you know
who they came to. This guy right here.

32
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,541
You know? So I'm sorry.
But just so you know,

33
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:58,106
this ain't nothing personal. All right?

34
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:01,299
You ain't gonna believe this.

35
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:03,261
Yeah?

36
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,226
We got the wrong house.

37
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:14,062
Oh, this shit ain't
gonna turn out well!

38
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:18,432
You don't listen, man! You're
like MacGruber! Goddamnit, man!

39
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,604
Well, ain't that some shit.

40
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:45,813
- Sheriff?
- What's the story?

41
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:49,882
It's just an all-out massacre.
Thirteen dead bodies, mounds of drugs,

42
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:53,534
- guns, spit and ass. It's a mess.
- So who were these miscreants?

43
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,367
No one appeared to be anybody special.

44
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,444
Just run-of-the-mill
dealers and bangers.

45
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:01,158
- Anybody talking?
- Ah, you know how it is.

46
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:04,241
Nobody heard nothing, nobody saw
nothing, and nobody talks to the po-po.

47
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:05,883
Yeah, that sounds about right.

48
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,584
Fill out all the necessary paperwork,
run the bodies through the county.

49
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:10,904
Have the report on my desk.

50
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:16,243
Sir, I also took the liberty to go
ahead and put it out over the wire.

51
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:17,942
See if we can get
a bead on these shooters.

52
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:21,685
- Now, why would you go and do that?
- Trying to speed things along.

53
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:23,234
Oh!

54
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:26,618
- You think I can't do my job.
- I just thought...

55
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,442
Don't do that! Don't ever do that.

56
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:31,873
Just do as you're told.

57
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,276
- Nothing?
- Nope!

58
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,259
- Not even half?
- Mm-mm.

59
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:51,125
Something's gotta change!
Risking our necks for no money.

60
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:54,090
This some bullshit!

61
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:58,286
I'm about tired of us getting fucked
six ways from Sunday, you hear me?

62
00:06:58,615 --> 00:07:02,143
Goddang, man!

63
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:06,299
I was gonna put a pool in
with that money.

64
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,170
Goddang, motherfucker!

65
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:18,525
Stop! Yeah, walk away, bitch!

66
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:21,817
You lucky I ain't in the mood
to whip your ass, boy!

67
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,669
Wasting food, motherfucker.

68
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,972
- Can I help you?
- Oh, shit!

69
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:09,228
- Sorry. You scared me.
- That's what I do.

70
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:17,776
I'm Celeste. I was hoping to talk
to you and your friends.

71
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:21,244
Friends? I ain't got no friends.

72
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:24,143
I've got my brothers.

73
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:27,896
Got my house. My car.

74
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,815
I've got a sexy little chica
standing in front of me.

75
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:34,432
But I ain't got no friends.

76
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,273
You wanna be my friend?

77
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,169
I saw you this morning.

78
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:43,074
I was hoping
to acquire your services.

79
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:48,185
You got the wrong fellas.
We was at church this morning.

80
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,290
- Really?
- Yeah.

81
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:52,652
So there's just three other white boys
that looked just like you

82
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:55,030
that ripped up a whole house
on Bacon Street?

83
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,363
Trying to figure out how you guys walked
out of there with all those witnesses.

84
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:01,662
And every cop in the state
isn't lined up at your door.

85
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:15,471
So, what's a pretty little girl like you
doing in a neighbourhood like that?

86
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:19,359
- Well, I was there to hire muscle...
- Hire him to do what?

87
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:23,704
Get my godson back
from my ex-husband.

88
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,957
Dibs.

89
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:34,321
Dang it! Cock-blocking motherfucker!

90
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:40,753
Lady, I'm not sure what it is
you think you're doing,

91
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:44,843
but that's not exactly
our line of expertise.

92
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:47,770
- I got money.
- How much?

93
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:50,284
Ten thousand.

94
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:55,800
Yeah, I don't think
saving people is really for us.

95
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:58,297
You know? Why don't you
take that shit to the cops?

96
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,920
They'll do it for free.

97
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:03,150
Twenty-five thousand.

98
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,340
Five thousand up front.

99
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:27,460
Come on inside and meet the boys.

100
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,514
This is what I'm talking about.
Clean lines, nothing to profile.

101
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,289
None of that spinner,
hydraulic shit to get you lit up.

102
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,328
What I'm talking about, Sal, is you
transporting anything and everything

103
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,214
in this pre-owned Hyundai Sonata.
And here's the reason why.

104
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,204
Hidden compartment. Coated
with coffee bean and talcum paste

105
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,573
no drug dog on the planet Earth
can sniff out.

106
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,113
This space is worry-free,
and this time next month,

107
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,374
I'm gonna have
a fucking fleet of them.

108
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,833
- Damn, that's tight.
- Hear that, Dad? It's tight.

109
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,366
So, what do you say, boys? You want
to take a few road trips for me?

110
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:17,843
Abso-fucking-lutely, Carlos.

111
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:24,341
We surely don't mind being your
fucking little mule, Don Carlos.

112
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,579
But we gotta talk about our cut.

113
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,095
We're the one doing all the risks.

114
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,918
You know, I just remembered something.
I need batteries and toilet paper.

115
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,765
And I need to get that Brad Pitt movie.

116
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:41,757
The one where he turns back
into a fucking baby?

117
00:11:42,037 --> 00:11:44,882
Running low on milk, a few things.

118
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:49,296
I wonder where I could get all these
items in one convenient location?

119
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:55,033
- Walmart.
- Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

120
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,872
I love the way you put "fucking"
in the middle of a word like that.

121
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:00,424
I'm gonna start using that shit.

122
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,609
You see, guys, I kind of, uh...

123
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:09,529
...look at my future empire as the
Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

124
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,336
But, you know,
we can't all be Sam Walton.

125
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:16,895
That's my job.

126
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:20,048
And when my foot soldiers
start talking about shit like cuts

127
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:23,888
and percentages and things like that,
well, see, that's partner talk.

128
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:27,016
And I don't need a partner.

129
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:31,379
I need stockers and cashiers
and mercenaries and mules.

130
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,524
And in your case, Padre,

131
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:36,204
dime-bag dealers
from the lawn and garden department.

132
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:38,756
Coincidentally, where I found you.

133
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:43,473
Now, Padre, I like you. I really do.
I like your son too.

134
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:46,499
I really appreciate all the shit
you've done for me, you know,

135
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,773
that God wouldn't be proud of.

136
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:53,985
But some things, you just have
to stop them before they start.

137
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:56,444
See, partnership leads to ambition.

138
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:59,987
Ambition leads to a word
they don't use much any more.

139
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:03,797
Mutiny.

140
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:29,361
- Papa, what's that?
- It's bad news.

141
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,812
Listen up, dipshits!
This here is Celeste.

142
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:37,003
And she'd like to give us an assload
of money to kidnap her godkid back

143
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:40,009
from her deadbeat ex-husband.
That about cover it?

144
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,288
- I guess so.
- Well, OK.

145
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:44,700
Let me just find my
missing persons report here,

146
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,244
and I'll get you right set up.

147
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:50,107
You out your damn mind, brother?

148
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,781
The big fellow over there,
that's Lincoln.

149
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:55,528
The mouthy little faggot here
is McQueen.

150
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,371
And I'm Brick.

151
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:01,840
Did you happen to mention that
kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

152
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:04,710
I was there this morning.

153
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:11,137
You was at church?

154
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:14,522
When I saw you guys take out that whole
house and walk out without a scratch,

155
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,745
I knew I found my guys.

156
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:22,642
Bull sheet. What the catch?

157
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:25,798
Yeah. Why didn't you just
go to the cops with this?

158
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,646
His voice box was crushed
when he was a kid. He can't talk.

159
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:33,607
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

160
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,320
Why would he go and do
a dumb thing like that?

161
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,324
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

162
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:40,556
I just want to get Rob
and take him away from all this shit.

163
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:44,415
- That window closes Tuesday night.
- Do we look like FedEx to you?

164
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:46,617
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

165
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,381
- Shut up, man.
- You shut up.

166
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,211
I'm talking to the lady.
Shut up, man!

167
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:51,522
- Shut up!
- I just want peace of mind.

168
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:53,384
That's something the cops can't give me.

169
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:00,434
- And you think we can provide that?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:00,702 --> 00:15:03,182
If he's arrested, he'll just get out
in 18 months and hunt me down.

171
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,857
This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

172
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:12,167
It is now. She just gave us
25,000 reasons to open up shop.

173
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,497
Five up front.

174
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:22,263
Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

175
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:24,960
It's a chance.

176
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,234
You wanted to be the last
true family man, Clark.

177
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,886
OK.

178
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:36,594
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

179
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:42,555
We'll even get your kid back.
But if this man, this, uh...

180
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:46,479
- Carlos.
- If he's as crazy as you say he is,

181
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,716
then why didn't he just kill
you in the first place?

182
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,108
He tried.

183
00:15:56,552 --> 00:15:57,883
So when you leave,

184
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:01,066
it would be great if Lincoln
could put a boot through his skull.

185
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,806
You ladies have any other questions?

186
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:18,516
Henry, there's someone
in the back for you. In your office.

187
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:23,426
- Who?
- Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

188
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,475
- Cute, too.
- Yeah. Thanks for that.

189
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,833
I'll be sure to freshen up
before I go in.

190
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:50,716
Agent Reese. Henry Millard.

191
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:53,829
- Pleasure, sir.
- Well...

192
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:57,840
- We don't see suits in here much.
- Yeah, I can see why.

193
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:02,485
- How do people move in this heat?
- At our own pace.

194
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,199
So...
what can I do you for?

195
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:10,825
Well, I wanted to ask you a few
questions regarding the shootout

196
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,742
that occurred earlier today.

197
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,128
We think we may have a lead
on some suspects.

198
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,661
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

199
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,539
It was a... It's an interesting region
you have over here.

200
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:27,057
It seems every few months there's
a large number of violent offenders

201
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:30,838
that go missing or show up dead,
but there's never any leads.

202
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:35,396
Cases just... go away.
It's very weird.

203
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:40,082
Well, I guess around here
finding justice for murderers

204
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,940
isn't a top priority.

205
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,738
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers?

206
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,403
I know all, son. But I can see you
came prepared for show and tell.

207
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:52,683
So... get with the getting.

208
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,776
All right. Prime suspects!

209
00:17:56,052 --> 00:18:01,014
Case dating back to their father,
Jonathan Warren Oodie,

210
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:04,838
or Johnny Boy Oodie, as he was called.

211
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:07,387
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

212
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:10,970
Apparently, in his mid-twenties,
Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

213
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:15,520
Made things very colourful for local
law enforcement back in the day.

214
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,098
Flash-forward, KKK just about
dumbed themselves out of existence

215
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:23,062
and Johnny Boy went out
in a blaze of glory

216
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,096
during a federal drug raid
in March of '86.

217
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:29,698
No known mother to speak of, which
makes these three a Christmas miracle.

218
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,326
Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?

219
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,674
There were no grandparents or kin
suitable to take the children in,

220
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,415
so they were sent into foster care.

221
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:43,164
<i>Then, when they became of age, they
started to become everyone's problem</i>

222
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,524
The oldest is Brick.
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.

223
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:50,101
Can't seem to stay out of trouble.
And boy, does he love his guns.

224
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:53,985
Then it looks as though they tried
to go legit for a minute.

225
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:58,289
So they put their middle brother,
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.

226
00:18:58,618 --> 00:19:01,588
He ended up killing
seven men in the ring. And guess what?

227
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,432
Absolutely nothing was done about it.
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,

228
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,392
saying it was accidental and part
of his neck-breaking gimmick.

229
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,885
And to make this giant fucker
even freakier, he cannot talk.

230
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:16,257
Or at least he couldn't
last time anybody checked.

231
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:19,674
Wrestled under the name
the Dixie Reaper.

232
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,658
And then there's McQueen.
Practically illiterate.

233
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,699
He's the baby of the brood.
He was well on his way

234
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:26,666
to becoming a real-life G.I. Joe.

235
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:29,377
<i>But he's got a bit of an issue
with authority.</i>

236
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:32,441
Whoo!

237
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:34,781
That's a mighty fine
detective job you've done, son.

238
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,922
- Thank you, sir.
- But... it ain't as easy as all that.

239
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,773
- So you do know the Oodie Brothers?
- Like I said, I know all.

240
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,611
I can't just bring them boys in 'cause
some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

241
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:54,344
Well, you can if some suit

242
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:58,276
from Chicago tells you to.

243
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:03,034
The longer you stay down here,
the more you're going to realise,

244
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,915
we don't like being
told what to do, son. Now...

245
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,193
...if you'll excuse me,
I got other work to attend to.

246
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:13,568
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking
for, you know, a little cooperation.

247
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:15,907
Once this thing gets wrapped up,
I'll get out of your hair.

248
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:17,807
Why don't you let me
worry about my county?

249
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,643
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

250
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,578
I'll drive us
until I can't drive no more.

251
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,579
Can you believe she went ahead
and paid us five grand up front?

252
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:51,702
I know, right?

253
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:56,825
I mean, you'd think she'd have
some trust issues, right?

254
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,805
- But hey, each to their own.
- Each to their own, man.

255
00:21:00,077 --> 00:21:02,399
Each to their own.

256
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:07,075
Now, I know we've got
an address to Austin,

257
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:10,460
but shouldn't she have given us like
a picture of the kid or something?

258
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:12,439
How many kids you reckon
they got up there?

259
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,676
I mean,
they ain't running a day-care centre.

260
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:18,513
- OK.
- Yeah.

261
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,959
What if we get there
and Rob's a baby?

262
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:25,991
Well, if he's a baby,
they got baby junk up there.

263
00:21:26,272 --> 00:21:28,240
- Oh, that's smart.
- It's not like they're riding around

264
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:31,805
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing.
I mean, come on.

265
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:35,958
Besides that, them bullet scars didn't
look too fresh on Celeste's belly.

266
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:37,773
- You're right. You're right.
- Yeah.

267
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,184
- What if there's more than one kid?
- Why are you asking me so many

268
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,151
goddamn questions, man?
We just went over this! What?

269
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:54,347
What do you want to know?!
What do you want to know?!

270
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:57,882
- How will we know which is Rob?
- I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

271
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,421
How about that? I'm gonna say,
"You know what, I don't want Kevin!

272
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:02,491
I don't want Michael!
No, I don't want Stephen!"

273
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:05,253
If there's a bunch of fucking kids
around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!

274
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:07,968
How about that?
Fucking hell, man!

275
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:10,234
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

276
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:13,728
We smash whoever's in front of us
and we take Rob!

277
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:18,419
Damn! Plain and simple!
What? Sorry, Lincoln.

278
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:21,427
- I don't know why you have to yell...
- Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

279
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:23,946
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

280
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,778
Where'd you learn that word?
Inquisitive?

281
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:31,049
- Where the fuck did you pick that up?
- It's in my lexicon, man!

282
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,224
- Jackass. Yeah?
- I've got it up here.

283
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:34,878
There's a lot you
don't know about me.

284
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:36,094
Are you ready for a potty break?

285
00:22:36,303 --> 00:22:37,748
How many books you read, motherfucker?

286
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:54,599
- Where are we?
- We're in Crockett.

287
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,991
Davy Crockett. What time is it?

288
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:01,295
Four.

289
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,507
Hey.

290
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:13,161
Hm... I guess there's
a little candy in every pinata.

291
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:24,684
Shh.

292
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:02,113
Got some free shit!

293
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:05,762
Take it easy, Van Damme! Hey.

294
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:08,590
Hadji at the front desk said
we're only a few hours from Austin.

295
00:24:08,858 --> 00:24:11,259
- Nice!
- Whoo! Ow!

296
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:19,431
- Who that?
- Fuck. Who do you think?

297
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,070
Don't answer that shit, man!

298
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,413
Don't answer it. Don't you...

299
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:27,677
- Hey.
- Hey?

300
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,048
Don't hey me.
The hell are you?

301
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,706
Texas.

302
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:34,654
Texas?

303
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:37,366
Well, what in the Sam Hill could
you possibly have to do in Texas?

304
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:39,765
Hey, man. Check this out.

305
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:43,304
Permian Stadium from
Friday Night Lights. It's on the way!

306
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:45,127
I took a job out here.

307
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:48,403
Oh, you took a job!
Well, excuse me.

308
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:53,221
What was I thinking? I forgot you guys
are freelance artists. So, Mr Brick,

309
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:56,735
- what job did you take?
- Look, it's not a big deal, man.

310
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,922
All right? It's just a little gig
out here. We can handle it.

311
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:01,209
Oh, you're going to handle it
like you handled me yesterday?

312
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:02,695
It's bad enough you can't
check a damn address,

313
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,122
but you also got to lay them
pork chops out in my backyard?

314
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,979
- Put it on our tab.
- What was that?

315
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,942
- Nothing!
- You watch your mouth, son.

316
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:13,377
This ain't a joke. This little misstep
is gonna be a pain for me,

317
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:15,599
but you may have just stuck
your dick in a hornet's nest.

318
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,371
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

319
00:25:17,597 --> 00:25:19,440
I've got some jackleg
ATF agent up my ass,

320
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:21,684
looking to make a name
for locking up you idiots.

321
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:25,222
The last thing I need is for you dumb
shits to draw more unneeded attention.

322
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:29,572
I mean it, Brick. I better not hear shit
about your little Texas job.

323
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,141
Keep your ass off the grid.

324
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:33,250
Don't call my house.
Write this number down.

325
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:37,096
And for the love of God,
get rid of that damn cell phone.

326
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,893
- Yes, sir.
- Damn well better.

327
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:45,567
You mess around and fuck up
my pension, that's your ass.

328
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,277
I don't even know you.

329
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,915
Hey!

330
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:03,585
Check it out, man!
Permian Stadium!

331
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,221
It's on the way, man!
You want to win, put bubba in!

332
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:09,332
It's not on the way, jackass.

333
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,174
It is, man! It's Odessa, Texas!

334
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,131
Huh?

335
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,549
Man! Don't take it out on me
because you got your ass chewed.

336
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,565
We got work to do, boys.

337
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,326
I'll get my badge.

338
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,283
No. I figured we'd do
the old Roosevelt slammer.

339
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,366
Fuck, yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

340
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,282
Dibs, bitch! Whoo!

341
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,365
Goddamn it, Montane! I didn't want you
to blow the place to hell and back.

342
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,979
I don't give a shit! Would you fucking
listen to me every now and then?

343
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,327
Please? Goddamn it.
Come here, baby. Come here!

344
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:57,505
I don't know if your mama told you,
but you are hotter than shit.

345
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,071
Goddamn.

346
00:27:02,665 --> 00:27:05,509
Fuck.
That's the shit right there, boys!

347
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,842
From now on,
no more nickel and diming!

348
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,371
You get it? Only the finest!

349
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,476
- Hey, how come she's not naked?
- Don't know, boss.

350
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,977
Find out.

351
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,794
Hey. I'll call you when I need you.

352
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:22,344
All right. Bye.

353
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:28,835
Doesn't anybody know how
to use finesse any more?

354
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:57,763
You all right?

355
00:27:57,972 --> 00:28:00,976
- The helmet ain't work for shit.
- I told you. Aah!

356
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:03,475
All right, you go east, I go west!

357
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:24,854
Plain and simple. Smash and grab.

358
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:39,081
Oh, shit.

359
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:40,957
My bad, lady. You OK?

360
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:45,955
In my defence,
you do work for an asshole.

361
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,444
You Rob?

362
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:12,395
Brick!

363
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,003
Goddang. Brick!

364
00:29:24,855 --> 00:29:26,983
Goddamn it.

365
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,997
Fuck.

366
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,979
Oh, shit.

367
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,528
Boss! Boss, are you all right?

368
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:44,388
What the fuck
does it look like, Marty?

369
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:47,193
It looks like a fucking bomb went off.

370
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:53,973
Denny?

371
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:57,226
- What the hell happened?
- The kid.

372
00:29:57,513 --> 00:30:00,836
- Say what?
- Three guys come in.

373
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:03,908
Yes, I know three guys came in!
They came all the fucking way in!

374
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:07,634
- I see that!
- They took the kid.

375
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:11,025
Fuck! Goddamn it!

376
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:17,637
They shot my motherfucking maid!

377
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,959
OK, Marty,
I know it's over a year ago,

378
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,937
but I need you to fucking think, OK?
You did kill Celeste, right?

379
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:29,460
You wouldn't lie to me about that shit,
would you?

380
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:32,802
I put three bullets in her gut.
She looked dead to me.

381
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,618
But you didn't check to see
if she was dead, did you?

382
00:30:37,054 --> 00:30:38,466
Guess not.

383
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,686
That was our golden ticket,
you stinking fuck!

384
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:44,707
How am I going to pay for this?
You got the dough?

385
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,219
Hm?

386
00:30:47,024 --> 00:30:49,231
You got a fucking piggy bank
in your fat ass?

387
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:52,056
Sorry, boss.

388
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:56,713
OK. As long as you're sorry, I guess
that's all that matters, isn't it?

389
00:30:56,993 --> 00:30:59,564
I'll take care of it, boss. I'll make
sure it's right. I'll take care of it.

390
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,239
Good, good. Thanks, thanks.

391
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:04,778
Yeah. Hand me my goddamn pills,
will you?

392
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:14,807
You still want to go look at that car?

393
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:26,694
That Carlos man make you cripple?

394
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:32,129
Hi, buddy.

395
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:34,725
I don't think he can talk.

396
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:39,219
- Well, ain't this some shit, man.
- What?

397
00:31:39,494 --> 00:31:41,304
That he's all, you know...

398
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:45,381
- Don't do that shit!
- What?

399
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,947
'Cause you're being mean!
He can't help it.

400
00:31:50,047 --> 00:31:51,095
You OK?

401
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,563
You hurt?

402
00:31:54,553 --> 00:31:57,033
You OK? He can understand us.

403
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:00,628
How the hell did you get
"I'm OK" from that?

404
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:06,813
Hey, look, buddy. We ain't going
to hurt you, all right? Celeste sent us.

405
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:10,126
You know Celeste?

406
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,567
Huh?

407
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:16,261
Yeah! There he goes!
See? He understands us just fine.

408
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:19,940
Once again, how the hell do you
know what he's saying?

409
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:21,691
You the tard whisperer?

410
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:23,200
You say that again,
I'm gonna kill you.

411
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:25,497
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- Say it again. You are making fun.

412
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:28,403
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- You are making fun of him.

413
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:31,675
It's just a little weird that she didn't
mention the poor little fella's

414
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:34,095
- all buggered up, you know?
- It don't matter.

415
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:37,791
She sent us to get Rob.
We got Rob. All right?

416
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,480
You good, buddy?

417
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:45,387
- I wasn't being mean.
- You were being mean!

418
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:47,290
You were making fun of him.

419
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:52,625
Bless his heart.
He ain't got no control over that.

420
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:59,799
It's a damn good thing
he wasn't in the living room.

421
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:03,621
I'm just saying.

422
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,103
Hm-mm.
Yeah, we can do that.

423
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,198
Oh, we can get that done.

424
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:26,885
All right, Carlos. I'm just
finishing up a little something here.

425
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:31,611
Then we'll get on the road.
Don't you worry about a thing, sweetie.

426
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:38,301
Excuse me, councilman.

427
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:01,834
What? He wanted a bath.

428
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:10,822
Another one already?
I didn't even get off.

429
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:14,911
- It's for Carlos.
- Well, that makes it a bit better.

430
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:47,370
Doesn't get much better
than this, Bill.

431
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,500
It'd be better than this if the fish
was biting as well as these chiggers.

432
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,661
You gotta be shitting me.

433
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:01,153
This is where the real police matters
are handled, huh?

434
00:35:01,414 --> 00:35:04,498
Oh, you mean on private property?
Yeah, sometimes it is.

435
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:06,842
Anthony Reese, ATF.

436
00:35:07,086 --> 00:35:10,374
- Bill Hawkins. Nice to meet you.
- Bill's a representative for the state.

437
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:12,439
Ah, nice to meet you, sir.

438
00:35:14,094 --> 00:35:16,301
Bill, have you heard about an
investigation going on in our area?

439
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:17,761
No, I haven't.

440
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:20,864
It seems Agent Reese was sent
down here to check up on us.

441
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:22,747
Seeing as he's an Ivy League grad,

442
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:24,980
I guess that makes him
better at our jobs than we are.

443
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:26,278
Oh, is he now?

444
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:30,374
No. I'm not trying to intrude,
only assist.

445
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,983
Sheriff, I feel
like we got off on the wrong foot.

446
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:36,808
We're on the same team.
I don't want it to feel like

447
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:39,125
I'm infringing on your territory.
I just...

448
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,020
I really think we have something
with these Oodies.

449
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,454
We don't talk business
when I'm fishing, son.

450
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,916
When I'm about to cast.
Don't get hooked!

451
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:52,920
We can, however, talk all
about it tomorrow at my office.

452
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,230
It don't excite me that some
Yankee's come down here

453
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:58,596
imposing his authority
on one of my best friends.

454
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:02,930
This county has the lowest crime rate
in the state, last time I checked.

455
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,559
- Uh-huh.
- I know you Democrats

456
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,136
think we need your help,

457
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,727
but I'm here to tell you that we don't.
Bad enough I've gotta fight you in D.C.

458
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,961
Now you can just ease your way out
of here the same way you eased in.

459
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:18,175
I'd like to enjoy what's left
of my afternoon.

460
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,133
Alrighty, then.

461
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:29,280
Why don't you go back home
to that wife of yours?

462
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:33,075
It must be hard raising
a baby all by herself.

463
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:18,219
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

464
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:25,270
- Pretty classy joint you've got here
- Thanks. Nice shirt.

465
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:34,002
- You Lucky?
- That's right.

466
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:36,205
Let's see about that.

467
00:37:36,451 --> 00:37:38,580
Hey, man, why don't you
turn that shit off back there for me?

468
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:42,117
That's Mac. He's 98 years old.
I think he's earned the right

469
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:44,543
to watch a little T and A if he wants.

470
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:47,080
Why? He ain't jerking nothing.

471
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:49,545
Yeah, well, he's been watching that
stuff since I opened the joint,

472
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:52,529
so I'm gonna keep it that way,
all right?

473
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:54,691
Well, how about this?

474
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:59,889
If I go back there, I'm gonna bust
up Mac and your TV. How about that?

475
00:38:00,267 --> 00:38:02,873
Yeah, is that a fact?

476
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,972
- What the fuck?
- See, I got a minor with me.

477
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:13,398
I'd appreciate it if he wouldn't
have to listen to that.

478
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:22,216
Hey, Mac, I'm gonna give it
a rest for a second, all right?

479
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:25,104
I'm looking for
a friend of mine. Terry.

480
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:26,302
Macky?

481
00:38:30,424 --> 00:38:32,472
I'm gonna give it a rest!

482
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,495
Mac.

483
00:38:35,722 --> 00:38:39,886
Say, Mac. Mac?

484
00:38:41,643 --> 00:38:43,612
It looks like Mac finally
had enough.

485
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,902
Hey, man.

486
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:52,656
Let me guess.
This is the part where you say

487
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:55,989
<i>you'll be back. Am I right?</i>

488
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,731
I'll be back.

489
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:06,300
You know this movie?

490
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,916
I'll be back.

491
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:29,881
I'll be back.

492
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:37,517
Well, ain't you full of surprises?

493
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:03,651
Hey, this is Lucky. Yeah, listen,
I need an ambulance down here, OK?

494
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:06,586
It seems like Mac's passed on, OK?

495
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:13,981
You got anything to eat back there
besides the bar food bullshit?

496
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:18,410
- I have to go get it.
- Well, rustle something up, man.

497
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:21,396
I need something for the kid, please.
We're in a big hurry if you don't mind.

498
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:23,509
Oh, yeah? You running from something?

499
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,605
Goddamn.

500
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:52,994
How's it going, ladies?
Need something to drink?

501
00:40:53,323 --> 00:40:55,724
Don't know what we'd like yet.

502
00:40:55,993 --> 00:40:58,998
All right. Well,
you let us know when you do.

503
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:00,891
Looking real good up in here.

504
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:08,044
Watch this.

505
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:20,428
Dibs.

506
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:34,461
Name's McQueen.

507
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,145
What's your name?

508
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:40,823
Can I buy you a drink?

509
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,567
Her name is Jez.
And you can buy us a drink.

510
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:50,407
Lucky? Can I get us some beers
for my new friend Jez.

511
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,010
And her ladies. And that kid's
still waiting on his food.

512
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,147
I'll be right back.

513
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,474
Figure it out.

514
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,461
What's your story?
And I'm gonna pretend I'm listening.

515
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,862
Damn bullshit!
Don't want the kid seeing porn,

516
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:16,403
but when some sweet tail walks in,
they forget all about that, right?

517
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:21,504
First time in four years I got
some sweet, fresh snapper come in here,

518
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:25,162
and I'm down here making fucking
sandwiches for the Road Warriors?

519
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,872
Kiss my fucking ass!

520
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,371
Hm...

521
00:42:40,935 --> 00:42:42,016
Wanna dance?

522
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,411
About damn time.

523
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:52,005
Not like that.

524
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,485
Um...

525
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:00,316
Not like that either.

526
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,768
Brick?

527
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:07,972
Is that the Big Whopper
or the Ponytail?

528
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:10,535
By the way, Marty says hi.

529
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,122
Yeah? Well, tell Marty, "Fuck you. "
I see you dodged another bullet.

530
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:15,759
How'd you get this number?

531
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:19,375
These days, baby,
I can get just about anything I want to.

532
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:23,530
For instance, right now I'm
getting back my paycheque on wheels

533
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:27,861
- from those amateurs you sent.
- Moneygrubbing piece of shit!

534
00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:30,401
What happened to us, baby?
We were good once, weren't we?

535
00:43:30,654 --> 00:43:33,863
Fuck you! We were never good.
I got played and that's that.

536
00:43:34,157 --> 00:43:38,686
Whoa. Hang on a second.
Anybody got played, it was me.

537
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:41,882
I thought I had a bitch
that was down with this shit.

538
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:44,056
You killed his parents, you psycho!

539
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:46,695
And it makes me sick that
I brought you into their world!

540
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:49,090
Don't you think they're just
a bad judge of character?

541
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,263
It ain't my fault all your
friends are richer than shit.

542
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,753
And you know something? At the end
of the day, I think you knew.

543
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:57,979
If I knew, I would have lit your
gutless ass on fire while you slept!

544
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:01,156
Now, there's
the feisty bitch I know!

545
00:44:01,435 --> 00:44:04,167
I wish it hadn't
ended up the way it did.

546
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:08,524
But what's Clyde gonna do
if Bonnie crosses him and goes soft?

547
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:12,228
And besides, what does that
son of a bitch need money for?

548
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,857
I mean, how much can a wheelchair cost?
Two or three hundred dollars?

549
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:18,598
You lost, motherfucker!
Rob's coming back with me. Deal with it.

550
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:24,370
Now, girlie, obviously you
didn't learn the first time around.

551
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:27,032
Let me tell you
how this shit's gonna end.

552
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,999
I sent some really awful bitches
to handle this situation.

553
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:35,111
Now, once they track down your fellas,
it's not gonna be a bloodbath.

554
00:44:35,388 --> 00:44:38,359
It's gonna get fucking sexy.

555
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:46,286
They'll single them out,
divide them up, then thin the herd.

556
00:45:31,947 --> 00:45:33,871
Each one will have
forgotten about everything,

557
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:36,723
except for the fine piece
of strange grinding on them.

558
00:45:56,472 --> 00:45:59,476
Then, without warning,
their lives will be snuffed out

559
00:45:59,768 --> 00:46:04,491
and the girls deliver Rob just in time
for me to plan the boy's 18th birthday.

560
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:06,700
You should have stayed dead, darling.

561
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:10,834
'Cause unless your name is Jesus,
you had no business coming back.

562
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:12,964
See you soon.

563
00:46:57,037 --> 00:46:58,323
Why don't you try a taste of me?

564
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:21,430
Well, hi, big guy.
Here's my boom stick.

565
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:26,587
Oh, shit!

566
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:44,144
Hey! Hey, don't be
fucking around up there!

567
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:17,523
Fuck!

568
00:48:27,255 --> 00:48:31,385
Well, those girls were the longest
relationship I ever had.

569
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:36,637
You OK, bud? Huh?

570
00:48:41,186 --> 00:48:43,473
All right, come on.
I wanna move. Let's go.

571
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:51,164
Lucky's about to get lucky
up in this motherfucker.

572
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:54,334
Do this shit right.
I'm gonna do it all night.

573
00:48:54,618 --> 00:48:56,541
I've got to pay to play.

574
00:48:56,786 --> 00:49:00,029
Five girls like that come in there,
you've got to pay to play.

575
00:49:00,332 --> 00:49:01,572
That pussy ain't free.

576
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,874
Don't you laugh at me.
I'm gonna make you work all this,

577
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:05,892
all this extra weight off me,
because all I've been doing

578
00:49:06,129 --> 00:49:09,656
is eating fried chicken, baby
and fried collards!

579
00:49:09,966 --> 00:49:14,131
Fried! Everything fried!
I saw a man fry a Twinkie yesterday.

580
00:49:14,472 --> 00:49:18,272
Hill County officials
have these renderings to go on.

581
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,409
Baby, let me call you right back.

582
00:49:20,644 --> 00:49:22,090
...the assailants are travelling
with a minor,

583
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:25,283
and appear to be highly dangerous.
If you see anyone

584
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:28,410
fitting this description,
please contact the local authorities.

585
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:31,175
- I'll be a motherfucker.
- Back to you with the weather, Bob.

586
00:49:33,992 --> 00:49:36,962
That sexy bitch broke
her damn heel off in my back.

587
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,781
Whoo!

588
00:49:39,497 --> 00:49:42,502
- What in the hell was that?
- I don't know.

589
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:45,876
But you can bet I'm gonna
call Celeste and find out.

590
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:53,516
Rambo time.

591
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:16,765
Now, you ain't gonna
get me back for this later?

592
00:50:17,038 --> 00:50:18,642
Promise me now.

593
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:23,051
'Cause I've got a feeling
this is gonna hurt.

594
00:50:24,294 --> 00:50:28,300
- He's taking it, man.
- Take it like Drago!

595
00:50:28,633 --> 00:50:29,964
Drago.

596
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:34,818
Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago!

597
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,450
- Yeah, baby!
- Man! She got you good! Whoo!

598
00:50:48,694 --> 00:50:52,779
Hill County officials
have these renderings to go on.

599
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:56,006
Eyewitness accounts say the assailants
are travelling with a minor

600
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:59,449
and appear to be highly dangerous.
If you see anyone

601
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:02,957
- fitting this description, please...
- Fuck me!

602
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:10,383
Hey!

603
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:14,940
They did a really good job, didn't they?
It looks just like them too.

604
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:17,789
Look at that.
It was all over the news.

605
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:21,461
Sheriff, this is the first time
that evidence

606
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:24,812
has literally been
brought to my doorstep.

607
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:29,341
We were able to pick up
an address for them, too.

608
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,816
I'll have a search and seizure
here by noon.

609
00:51:32,073 --> 00:51:34,041
And surprise, surprise!

610
00:51:34,284 --> 00:51:36,525
It's located on a piece
of residential land

611
00:51:36,787 --> 00:51:40,873
here in your county, Sheriff.
Can you believe that?

612
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:44,019
That sounds like a hell of a plan, son.
What can I do to help?

613
00:51:44,294 --> 00:51:47,855
Well, I'm guessing half the roads that
get me there won't show up on my GPS.

614
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:52,145
So if you could do me a favour
and simply escort me to the property,

615
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:55,838
that would be fantastic.

616
00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:02,178
Oh... You mean that old-ass
condemned shack out on Euleton?

617
00:52:02,522 --> 00:52:06,448
Son, you didn't hear? Fire chief let the
volunteers burn that up for training.

618
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:10,065
- Burn it up for training.
- Yeah.

619
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:13,211
Yeah, I think it was scheduled
for early this morning.

620
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:15,381
Is that right?

621
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:19,649
- Well, I suggest you better stop them.
- I could call Chief Walters,

622
00:52:19,915 --> 00:52:22,725
but I'm pretty sure ain't nothing
left out there but smoke and ash.

623
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:26,404
My! I'm really sorry about that.

624
00:52:26,714 --> 00:52:29,240
It really sounded like you had
something there.

625
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:37,022
Motherfucker,
I'm done with you wasting my time.

626
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,876
I don't ever remember asking for it.

627
00:52:40,143 --> 00:52:42,225
This good-old-boy justice thing
you got going on,

628
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:45,450
letting the trash take out the trash,
saving tax dollars

629
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:48,054
by keeping the bottomfeeders
out of the system

630
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,449
so you can just go fishing all day,

631
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:53,741
that's a slippery slope
you're playing on.

632
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:56,393
It's gotten to the point where
you're no better than they are, Sheriff.

633
00:52:57,996 --> 00:53:00,397
Yeah, I'd be careful if I was you.

634
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:06,195
Well, I'll take
that under advisement.

635
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:13,809
Shit.

636
00:53:42,251 --> 00:53:44,253
Wake up.

637
00:53:44,503 --> 00:53:47,986
Go get Rob something to eat.
I'm gonna call Celeste.

638
00:54:07,736 --> 00:54:11,058
Ooh...
Found the mother lode, boy!

639
00:54:20,915 --> 00:54:24,443
I'm gonna pay for it.
Don't worry. God.

640
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,141
You see, man, when you
open up something in the store...

641
00:54:37,016 --> 00:54:39,257
...you have to pay for it.

642
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:47,759
No one taught me that
when I was young.

643
00:54:49,529 --> 00:54:52,056
I learnt that one the hard way.

644
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:54,248
From the cops.

645
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:00,110
What?

646
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:05,331
What's wrong, man?

647
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,781
I don't know you mean
by all that squirming.

648
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,612
Help me out, bud. What you need, huh?
What you need?

649
00:55:14,555 --> 00:55:16,319
You got to take a piss?

650
00:55:18,727 --> 00:55:21,333
You're hungry. Goddamn,
of course you're hungry!

651
00:55:21,604 --> 00:55:26,565
Let's get you something to eat, eh?
OK. Let's go.

652
00:55:26,943 --> 00:55:28,787
Man!

653
00:55:30,614 --> 00:55:33,185
It's like working out a riddle
every time talking to this boy.

654
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,578
Morning, sunshine! You know,

655
00:55:35,827 --> 00:55:38,672
I don't remember crazy-ass biker chicks
being involved in our deal.

656
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:42,597
I don't remember leaving Carlos alive
in the deal either. Is Rob all right?

657
00:55:42,918 --> 00:55:44,647
Fuck!

658
00:55:46,214 --> 00:55:48,103
Yeah, he's probably scared
half to death, but he's fine.

659
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:50,469
- Let me talk to him.
- He's inside getting something to eat

660
00:55:50,718 --> 00:55:52,368
with McQueen. Besides,
you and I got something to talk about.

661
00:55:52,595 --> 00:55:54,245
All right? What the hell
was that last night?

662
00:55:54,472 --> 00:55:57,920
I told you, Carlos would try to get
Rob back if you didn't kill him.

663
00:55:58,226 --> 00:56:00,752
What are you talking about? We killed
every motherfucker in that place.

664
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,500
Well, evidently not, Brick!

665
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:05,856
All right. Why would a guy like
Carlos, what would he want to do

666
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,431
with a kid in Rob's condition?

667
00:56:08,695 --> 00:56:13,145
Carlos killed Rob's parents,
and then lied to me about it.

668
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:15,972
That might have been something
you wanted to mention.

669
00:56:16,245 --> 00:56:18,009
All right, look. I'm sorry.

670
00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:22,219
Rob has a trust
that matures when he's 18,

671
00:56:22,502 --> 00:56:27,030
and as legal guardians, we would
get him and eventually the money.

672
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:31,467
That too might be something that
you wanted to mention! Fuck!

673
00:56:31,803 --> 00:56:36,365
Rob's trust matures next week and...
Carlos will do anything to get it.

674
00:56:36,724 --> 00:56:40,126
- Brick, you're all he's got.
- All right. New plan.

675
00:56:40,436 --> 00:56:44,237
- You meet us halfway.
- Fine. Where?

676
00:56:45,692 --> 00:56:48,218
Vicksburg, Mississippi.
Big Bayou Campground.

677
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,942
I'll be there as soon as I can.

678
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,602
And if you lie to me again,
Carlos will be the least of your worries.

679
00:56:56,953 --> 00:56:59,844
I already dropped five bitches.
I won't hesitate to make it six.

680
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:12,190
Now, you may have heard
of pig in a blanket,

681
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,879
but this here is a pig in the sun.

682
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,644
Whoo!

683
00:57:19,852 --> 00:57:23,573
You want hair on your chest,
now, don't you? Strippers like it.

684
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,766
Hand me a napkin, man.

685
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,526
You all right?

686
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,576
Hey. Don't worry.

687
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:44,919
Don't worry, man.
Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

688
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:46,825
He's OK.

689
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,233
...believed to be
responsible for the shooting

690
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:51,629
in a rural Texas bar.

691
00:57:51,845 --> 00:57:54,417
They are travelling with a disabled
young man and believed to be

692
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:58,925
armed and dangerous. Do not
approach these men if you see them.

693
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:10,702
Who wants a Snicker bomb, huh?

694
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,913
Think you can kidnap
some kid and get away with it?

695
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:23,466
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math,
five whore assassins

696
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:26,154
can't trump three retards
and a fucking cripple.

697
00:58:26,422 --> 00:58:28,902
I mean, well,
according to my calculations,

698
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:31,177
they should be in your
area someplace by now.

699
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,510
But that's not my fucking job
to figure out, is it?

700
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:36,653
I mean, isn't owning
the road your goddamn job?

701
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:38,982
That's what I thought. OK.

702
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:41,708
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do.
Just get my boy back.

703
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:43,937
Yes! Get it done!

704
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:53,811
- Yeah?
- We're in a world of shit down here.

705
00:58:54,118 --> 00:58:55,768
Yeah, and now it's
spilling over into mine.

706
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:58,601
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg,
Mississippi. OK?

707
00:58:58,873 --> 00:59:02,878
- Big Bayou Campground. We could...
- Stop. Stop! Shut up!

708
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:05,498
Just shut the fuck up!
The less I know, the better.

709
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:09,043
- I taught you better than this!
- Look, I just thought that if,

710
00:59:09,343 --> 00:59:10,993
you know,
we could run in and do a quick...

711
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:15,588
Don't do that! Don't get ideas!
Just do what the fuck I say!

712
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:18,095
Things ran smooth when we did that,
didn't it?

713
00:59:18,894 --> 00:59:21,022
<i>I cleaned up your shit,
you took care of mine.</i>

714
00:59:21,272 --> 00:59:23,274
I could have handled this hotshot.

715
00:59:23,523 --> 00:59:26,004
But now this shit has gone public.

716
00:59:26,277 --> 00:59:28,928
There's repercussions
to working for yourself.

717
00:59:29,196 --> 00:59:32,166
- About time you learned that.
- Meaning what?

718
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:36,217
<i>I got to cut ties, Brick.
I cleaned up everything on my end</i>

719
00:59:36,538 --> 00:59:39,382
So, what you do from now on
rests solely on your shoulders.

720
00:59:39,665 --> 00:59:43,512
If you come back here,
I got no choice but to put you down.

721
00:59:44,962 --> 00:59:46,407
I got a family to protect.

722
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:54,174
I'll be sure to let the boys know
that we're on our own again.

723
00:59:54,473 --> 00:59:56,396
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

724
01:00:02,857 --> 01:00:05,906
Brick! We gots to go!

725
01:00:06,193 --> 01:00:08,082
We made the news!

726
01:00:19,498 --> 01:00:22,343
Hood Pirates! Mount up!

727
01:00:43,023 --> 01:00:44,513
Whoo!

728
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:48,640
Give me that!

729
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:53,683
- You call Millard?
- Yeah.

730
01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:56,442
Well, what did he say?

731
01:00:56,663 --> 01:00:58,267
The suspects
in question are believed to be

732
01:00:58,498 --> 01:01:01,707
- Brick Oodie and his two brothers...
- Nothing.

733
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:05,164
They hail from the Atmore area,
located in Montgomery, Alabama.

734
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:08,387
They drew you to look like a fag.
Look at that.

735
01:01:08,676 --> 01:01:11,520
What the fuck you do that for, man?

736
01:01:18,477 --> 01:01:20,718
- What the fuck, man?
- Come on! Come on, huh?

737
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:21,980
- What are you do...?
- Come on!

738
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:23,793
I ain't gonna fucking hurt you,
you little faggot!

739
01:01:24,025 --> 01:01:26,426
- Stop, man!
- Come on! Come here!

740
01:01:26,694 --> 01:01:28,059
Want some? You want some?

741
01:01:28,279 --> 01:01:31,522
- Fuck!
- What the devil got into you?

742
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:36,678
I fucked us.

743
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:41,019
How you mean?

744
01:01:41,293 --> 01:01:46,380
Uh, let's see. Millard won't have
anything to do with us any more

745
01:01:46,756 --> 01:01:49,919
'cause he can't clean up that mess
with the biker chicks down at the bar.

746
01:01:50,218 --> 01:01:52,825
So now we can't go back to 'Bama.

747
01:01:53,097 --> 01:01:55,987
And all of them son of bitches
we mowed down in Austin?

748
01:01:56,267 --> 01:01:59,237
- Guess what we missed.
- Carlos.

749
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:04,154
And he ain't gonna stop neither.
He's already tracked down Celeste.

750
01:02:04,442 --> 01:02:08,447
So now we gotta get him to fucking
Vicksburg so they can disappear.

751
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,424
Well...

752
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:14,104
This is getting better by the minute.

753
01:02:17,288 --> 01:02:21,260
Now, I like that little fella
just as much as anybody.

754
01:02:23,462 --> 01:02:28,913
But tell me something. Just give me one
reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

755
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:33,157
They ain't got no other options.

756
01:02:33,388 --> 01:02:35,470
Hell, we ain't got
no other options either.

757
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:41,034
I mean, look at us.
We can't even take care of ourselves.

758
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:43,903
Has it ever crossed your mind

759
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:47,352
that maybe he stands
a better chance without us?

760
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:52,185
- It's just different.
- How's this different?

761
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:54,851
- It's just different!
- How the fuck is it different?

762
01:02:56,287 --> 01:02:57,891
We had a brother...

763
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:02,154
...who passed away
before you can even remember.

764
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:05,536
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

765
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:08,529
He was all buggered up,
and he was in a wheelchair.

766
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,010
Daddy beat his ass every single day.
Treated him like a dog.

767
01:03:13,346 --> 01:03:18,035
And there's nothing
we could do about it. Different.

768
01:03:27,362 --> 01:03:30,730
Well, he gets a pass. I don't
understand why you didn't say nothing.

769
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:34,480
- How come you never said nothing?
- What do you want me to say to you?

770
01:03:36,037 --> 01:03:37,766
I'm sorry, all right?

771
01:03:37,997 --> 01:03:41,127
But ever since I've seen this fella,
I can't stop thinking about it.

772
01:03:49,885 --> 01:03:51,695
How'd he die?

773
01:03:52,721 --> 01:03:53,768
- How'd he die?
- I don't know.

774
01:03:53,972 --> 01:03:56,179
He was there one day and gone the next.

775
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:01,758
I asked Daddy about it one time,
but that went over like a fart in church.

776
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,158
What was his name?

777
01:04:15,954 --> 01:04:20,005
- They never named him.
- Fuck me.

778
01:04:44,692 --> 01:04:47,503
Got them bitches! Dead ahead!

779
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:57,456
And this time, try not to hit
the motherfucking baby.

780
01:05:01,876 --> 01:05:03,241
Here they come!

781
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:05,749
I'm giving it all she's got.

782
01:05:06,006 --> 01:05:09,215
Monaco ain't got nothing left!
Strap in Rob! Here they come, boys!

783
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,433
What the hell is this motherfucker?

784
01:05:14,391 --> 01:05:17,235
Hey, Rottweiler!
You better back the fuck up, mutt!

785
01:05:20,313 --> 01:05:22,316
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

786
01:05:25,777 --> 01:05:26,824
The kid's in the back!

787
01:05:41,961 --> 01:05:44,248
Aah!

788
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:51,922
They took the kid!
I thought I told you to strap him in!

789
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:54,831
They took the fucking door, man!
I really don't think a fucking seatbelt

790
01:05:55,099 --> 01:05:56,908
would have mattered right now! Go!

791
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,570
- Hey, he all right?
- How in the fuck do I know?

792
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:11,105
Here they come! Just like you said!

793
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:16,740
Hey! Help the driver.
You want to see this.

794
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,280
We're about to fuck
your babysitters up.

795
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,041
- Come on, boy!
- Whoo! Come on!

796
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:35,461
Welcome to the South, motherfuckers!

797
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:43,627
Whoo! What you got now, bitches?!

798
01:06:46,194 --> 01:06:47,241
Time out, bitch!

799
01:07:05,465 --> 01:07:08,309
No. No, indeed. Hell no.

800
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,639
- Do something, you're the brains!
- We've gotta figure something out!

801
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:12,457
What?!

802
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:15,862
- Top rope!
- Top rope!

803
01:07:23,024 --> 01:07:24,913
Motherfuckers!

804
01:07:26,694 --> 01:07:28,583
Whoo!

805
01:07:32,701 --> 01:07:35,227
Get them, Lincoln! Come on!

806
01:07:38,665 --> 01:07:40,475
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

807
01:07:40,793 --> 01:07:42,761
Go get 'em!

808
01:07:43,003 --> 01:07:45,847
They're slowing down!
They're slowing down!

809
01:07:48,342 --> 01:07:49,832
Come on.

810
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:56,619
Lincoln!

811
01:08:12,743 --> 01:08:14,393
We're good!

812
01:08:15,705 --> 01:08:17,594
You all right, buddy?

813
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:28,551
You're one crazy redneck.

814
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:40,102
Trying to be a tough guy? Huh?
Running away from us?

815
01:08:42,941 --> 01:08:45,467
You want one of these?
You've earned it.

816
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:50,059
- How's Linc?
- Not so good.

817
01:08:50,406 --> 01:08:52,171
- What?
- You better check on him.

818
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,253
You got Rob?

819
01:08:58,166 --> 01:08:59,497
Fuck.

820
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:06,751
You do all this?

821
01:09:09,135 --> 01:09:10,865
By God.

822
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:15,744
It ain't your hat, bitch.

823
01:09:17,059 --> 01:09:19,666
Good work!

824
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:22,100
Let me take a look.

825
01:09:22,357 --> 01:09:24,280
Come on. Let me see it.

826
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:29,604
Shit!

827
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,081
Well, I think it's safe
to say that, uh,

828
01:09:33,327 --> 01:09:37,332
that surpasses McQueen's
level of doctoring.

829
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:40,995
- Fine.
- You are not fine.

830
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,531
We need to get that looked at.

831
01:09:43,796 --> 01:09:46,720
- Fine.
- All right. You're fine.

832
01:09:48,844 --> 01:09:50,892
Fine, my ass.

833
01:09:55,516 --> 01:09:57,281
Fuck!

834
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,604
McQueen!

835
01:10:22,003 --> 01:10:26,407
Montane! Montane,
where the fuck are you?

836
01:10:30,177 --> 01:10:31,224
Shit.

837
01:10:40,771 --> 01:10:43,457
Goddamn it!

838
01:10:45,319 --> 01:10:46,559
Hey. you guys need a ride?

839
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,288
Who are these fucking people?!

840
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:05,264
Nah, man. We're good.
Just keep going.

841
01:11:06,674 --> 01:11:08,676
Son of a bitch.

842
01:11:08,925 --> 01:11:12,817
He practically made these monsters,
then hung them out to dry.

843
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,586
You gotta be kidding me.

844
01:11:16,935 --> 01:11:19,667
And why aren't they working for me?!

845
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:25,929
Just get in the car.
I'm a nurse. I can help.

846
01:11:26,236 --> 01:11:27,727
That ain't such a bad idea.

847
01:11:29,741 --> 01:11:31,345
Bingo.

848
01:11:32,951 --> 01:11:35,318
What happened here?

849
01:11:36,372 --> 01:11:39,775
- I did that.
- The stabbing or the stitches?

850
01:11:40,084 --> 01:11:43,566
- The stitches.
- Infection is setting in.

851
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:46,532
I poured whiskey on it.

852
01:11:46,758 --> 01:11:48,601
Let me guess,
you saw that in a movie?

853
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:51,414
Yeah. Several.

854
01:12:03,233 --> 01:12:05,965
Hey-Hey,Rob?

855
01:12:07,196 --> 01:12:10,439
You hold onto that, all right?
You know that's his prize possession.

856
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:13,951
He's gonna need it when
he gets to feeling better, OK?

857
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:22,495
Chogan, this is Carlos.
I'm only calling as a last damn resort.

858
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:25,117
Some asshole took Rob
and I need you to kill him.

859
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,510
<i>If you can, bring me back the kid,
and if not, then fuck it.</i>

860
01:12:27,759 --> 01:12:29,921
If I can't have him, nobody can.

861
01:12:33,389 --> 01:12:34,754
They're close.

862
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,704
Finish up!

863
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,292
He gonna be all right?

864
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,777
Like I said, it's up to you.

865
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,689
You look really familiar.

866
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,912
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

867
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:09,065
Do you stay in shitty motels?
'Cause we clean them.

868
01:13:10,513 --> 01:13:14,040
Crockett.
That's where I've seen you.

869
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,323
Small world.

870
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:20,773
So why ain't you a nurse?

871
01:13:21,983 --> 01:13:26,148
- Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.
- Why don't you become legal?

872
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:29,093
Your country doesn't
make it that easy for us.

873
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:30,365
What are you talking about?

874
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:33,100
Just go down to the place
and fill out your paperwork.

875
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:37,101
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal.
I mean, you speak the language.

876
01:13:37,374 --> 01:13:40,139
That's more than most
of them do out here.

877
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,465
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

878
01:13:44,088 --> 01:13:46,740
Yeah, well, I might
be just an ignorant redneck,

879
01:13:47,008 --> 01:13:49,215
but at least I know who I am.

880
01:13:50,888 --> 01:13:54,336
I mean, you're a nurse.
You ought to be helping people.

881
01:13:54,641 --> 01:13:56,689
Not scrubbing toilets.

882
01:13:57,686 --> 01:14:02,567
Well, is that why you do what you do?
'Cause it's who you are?

883
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:09,022
Let's just say it runs in the family.
You know?

884
01:14:10,574 --> 01:14:13,943
Well, you're not gonna have
much family left at this pace.

885
01:14:21,878 --> 01:14:24,848
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for us.

886
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:28,180
I can't say that I'd exactly
done the same thing, so...

887
01:14:30,637 --> 01:14:32,366
You're welcome.

888
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:38,518
What would you say if...
if I offered you two grand

889
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:40,379
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi?

890
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:48,506
What do you say I convince you not
to do what you're about to do?

891
01:14:50,575 --> 01:14:53,021
I could take you anywhere else.

892
01:14:54,078 --> 01:14:58,721
Nah. This here's one of them
kind of deals, you know?

893
01:15:01,879 --> 01:15:06,886
We kind of had people controlling
what we do our whole lives, you know?

894
01:15:08,384 --> 01:15:10,352
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

895
01:15:59,772 --> 01:16:04,381
- Please keep the kid safe for me.
- Nothing bad's gonna happen.

896
01:16:04,736 --> 01:16:08,866
- We've just got a job to finish.
- I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

897
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,777
- Thank you.
- See ya.

898
01:16:17,915 --> 01:16:18,962
See you around.

899
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:31,217
Can we still put a pool in
with three grand?

900
01:16:33,974 --> 01:16:35,976
What you thinking?

901
01:16:39,605 --> 01:16:41,414
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

902
01:16:41,648 --> 01:16:43,491
But it's gonna be tough
with just two of us.

903
01:16:46,028 --> 01:16:48,077
What you mean two?

904
01:16:56,163 --> 01:16:57,165
That's fitting.

905
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:05,823
- You want to go high?
- No.

906
01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:19,936
You go and run in the house.

907
01:17:21,524 --> 01:17:25,814
No matter what you hear,
no matter what the people say,

908
01:17:26,153 --> 01:17:30,477
Papaw did what he could to make things
better for you than he had. OK?

909
01:17:30,825 --> 01:17:32,873
Go. Run along.

910
01:17:40,085 --> 01:17:43,613
Dispatch told me you'd, uh...
you'd be here.

911
01:17:43,923 --> 01:17:47,609
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea,
but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

912
01:17:47,926 --> 01:17:50,657
It might be too strong for you.

913
01:17:50,929 --> 01:17:52,056
Ah...

914
01:17:52,264 --> 01:17:58,271
You know, of all
the Southern idioms and charms,

915
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:02,374
you know which one
I find the most helpful?

916
01:18:02,693 --> 01:18:04,377
My extraordinary hospitality?

917
01:18:06,737 --> 01:18:09,821
The fact that nobody
ever throws anything away.

918
01:18:11,827 --> 01:18:13,750
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

919
01:18:13,996 --> 01:18:19,527
There was nothing in any database
that ever connected you to them.

920
01:18:21,837 --> 01:18:24,681
Wasn't no computer
files back in the day.

921
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:27,775
Another perk of Alabama
being behind the times.

922
01:18:28,052 --> 01:18:29,702
Paper trail easy as hell
to get rid of.

923
01:18:30,847 --> 01:18:33,373
Only thing this proves is that
a young deputy was doing his job.

924
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:37,165
Right, right, right.
Well, I figured you'd say that,

925
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:43,239
so I did a little further digging,
and I found this.

926
01:18:43,651 --> 01:18:45,255
You missed some paper, Henry.

927
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:50,896
You signed for $1,200 dollars
on May 26th, '05,

928
01:18:51,242 --> 01:18:53,483
$800 June 15th, '07

929
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:56,226
$1,100 on February 3rd, '08.

930
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,500
And it goes on and on and on.

931
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:01,721
That money was issued
for crime scene clean up.

932
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,292
And I can hire anybody
I damn well please.

933
01:19:05,591 --> 01:19:09,198
Well, since when do people get paid
to clean up a crime before it happens?

934
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:16,027
You are right though, Sheriff.

935
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:18,953
You've got the lowest
crime rate in the state.

936
01:19:20,815 --> 01:19:23,786
You certainly weren't paying
them much though, were you?

937
01:19:24,069 --> 01:19:26,800
It's no wonder
those dogs turned on you.

938
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:33,276
Now, listen. This story,
you know, could end one of two ways.

939
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:36,066
You could either help me out,
cooperate...

940
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:39,623
...or I could just arrest you
on the spot.

941
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:43,040
Take them down myself, eventually.

942
01:19:43,339 --> 01:19:45,148
Look, either way,
I've got to take you to prison,

943
01:19:45,382 --> 01:19:51,106
but you play nice, I'll see to it
that your sentence is shortened.

944
01:19:51,514 --> 01:19:54,757
Maybe one day you'll be able to see your
granddaughter graduate from high school.

945
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:11,270
Let's consider it
a professional courtesy.

946
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:15,448
They get big quick on you.

947
01:20:16,915 --> 01:20:19,283
You'll find that out sooner or later.

948
01:20:26,132 --> 01:20:28,579
- Come with me.
- No, no, no. Come on.

949
01:20:28,845 --> 01:20:31,052
- I don't think so.
- Cut that shit out.

950
01:20:31,305 --> 01:20:33,546
Fighting's a young man's game.

951
01:20:37,354 --> 01:20:41,245
- Where are you going, huh?
- Vicksburg.

952
01:20:41,565 --> 01:20:44,853
If anybody's gonna put an end to this,
it's going to be me.

953
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:50,167
You know, I'm the one that ain't
supposed to be trusting you.

954
01:20:50,451 --> 01:20:52,579
Y'all won the damn war.

955
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:04,845
Now this is the same face paint
that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

956
01:21:06,509 --> 01:21:09,274
Solidifies you as one of us.

957
01:21:15,019 --> 01:21:16,748
You scared?

958
01:21:18,396 --> 01:21:21,685
You're an Oodie now.
You got to swallow that fear.

959
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,392
For what it's worth,

960
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:35,028
I think you deserve more
than what you've been through.

961
01:21:36,081 --> 01:21:38,402
It ain't right,
people taking advantage of you

962
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:41,511
just because you can't help yourself.

963
01:21:44,048 --> 01:21:48,098
I know you may not have had a lot of
people in your life you can look up to.

964
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:54,181
Hell, I ain't telling you
to look up to us.

965
01:21:58,271 --> 01:22:01,993
I just want you to know that we're
going to do everything we can

966
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:03,649
to keep you from getting hurt.

967
01:22:12,786 --> 01:22:15,266
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

968
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:18,392
My new lookout.

969
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,764
You've been promoted.

970
01:22:46,947 --> 01:22:48,028
Hm.

971
01:22:50,408 --> 01:22:52,012
Empty-

972
01:23:02,505 --> 01:23:07,033
- That ain't much.
- It's gonna have to do.

973
01:23:14,976 --> 01:23:16,580
Lincoln don't look so good.

974
01:23:19,438 --> 01:23:21,521
Yeah, he's been better.

975
01:23:23,652 --> 01:23:25,541
Hey.

976
01:23:25,779 --> 01:23:30,104
You think she's gonna come
and see this thing through?

977
01:23:30,451 --> 01:23:32,215
Or is she just gonna run
for the hills?

978
01:23:33,412 --> 01:23:35,779
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

979
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:38,805
Yeah.

980
01:23:44,841 --> 01:23:49,609
Why you reckon God
would make someone like him?

981
01:23:51,973 --> 01:23:53,463
What?

982
01:23:54,476 --> 01:23:57,959
Why would God let something
be wrong with him like that?

983
01:24:03,985 --> 01:24:07,957
I don't know. Hell, man, I don't know.

984
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:14,892
Hell, why you asking me that, man?

985
01:24:16,207 --> 01:24:19,654
I don't know.
Just been thinking about it.

986
01:24:22,755 --> 01:24:25,839
I don't ask
why God made men like him.

987
01:24:28,553 --> 01:24:31,204
I wonder why he made men like us.

988
01:25:06,008 --> 01:25:07,248
How are the boys?

989
01:25:11,056 --> 01:25:13,423
All right.

990
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,574
- Hey, Brick?
- Hm?

991
01:25:19,106 --> 01:25:20,950
I'm starting to think we should
have finished school.

992
01:25:23,902 --> 01:25:25,392
At least junior high.

993
01:25:46,384 --> 01:25:48,706
It's almost over, bud.

994
01:26:10,618 --> 01:26:12,905
- Oh, shit!
- McQueen!

995
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:18,498
A fucking arrow, man? Fuck!

996
01:26:32,473 --> 01:26:33,999
Come on!

997
01:26:37,688 --> 01:26:40,055
Go!

998
01:26:40,315 --> 01:26:41,646
Move your ass, woman!

999
01:26:51,327 --> 01:26:53,250
- Shit.
- Where's Rob, Brick?

1000
01:26:53,496 --> 01:26:54,986
He's safe!

1001
01:26:58,292 --> 01:26:59,862
Stay right here.
I've gotta go get some ammo.

1002
01:27:00,086 --> 01:27:01,087
- No! I'm going with you.
- Stay here!

1003
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:03,583
- I'm going with you!
- Fuck!

1004
01:27:04,174 --> 01:27:05,585
- Come on, man!
- Go!

1005
01:27:13,599 --> 01:27:17,001
- Grab a gun. Fuck.
- Take me to fucking Rob!

1006
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:18,678
You're keeping your ass here!

1007
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:22,550
That was a fucking arrow, man!

1008
01:27:26,112 --> 01:27:28,241
Brick!

1009
01:27:34,247 --> 01:27:35,248
Brick!

1010
01:27:35,456 --> 01:27:38,427
Time out, motherfucker!
This ain't fun no more! Stop!

1011
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:42,840
Fuck me! Oh, shit.

1012
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,152
I told you to fucking stay here!

1013
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,445
You're really gonna say
I told you so right now?

1014
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:09,021
You mind yourself, woman!

1015
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:11,528
Shit!

1016
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:19,051
God!

1017
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,121
- Don't fucking move!
- Come out, come out.

1018
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:30,992
What you gonna do with that, huh?

1019
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:35,277
- McQueen!
- Hey!

1020
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:36,759
Hey! Hey!

1021
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,660
You're about to have
a bad day, John Redcorn.

1022
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,648
Remind me again who's
gonna have a bad day?

1023
01:29:38,501 --> 01:29:40,629
Ain't that a sight.

1024
01:30:34,685 --> 01:30:38,929
So, uh... you and your brothers
kidnapped the kid from, uh...

1025
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:42,118
...from Ms Martin, and you were
planning on holding him for ransom?

1026
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:46,326
- Yeah? All right.
- That's what I said.

1027
01:30:46,655 --> 01:30:50,183
And what about these other men here?
Who are they? Huh?

1028
01:30:51,536 --> 01:30:52,742
Hm?

1029
01:30:55,456 --> 01:30:58,904
- Oh...
- All right. All right.

1030
01:30:59,211 --> 01:31:01,657
You'll have plenty of time to think
about your answers in prison. Yeah?

1031
01:31:11,974 --> 01:31:14,818
- Agent Reese?
- Special Agent Simmons! Hey!

1032
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:17,150
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1033
01:31:17,397 --> 01:31:20,207
I'm very impressed
with how you navigated these waters.

1034
01:31:20,483 --> 01:31:22,963
I'm putting in a request to have
you take over this territory.

1035
01:31:23,236 --> 01:31:25,558
- No, no, no, no, sir...
- Don't worry about the details.

1036
01:31:25,822 --> 01:31:28,666
We'll get everything handled. Cover
the moving expenses and everything.

1037
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,952
- But my wife...
- It's a fine place to raise a family.

1038
01:31:31,202 --> 01:31:33,808
- Sir... I...
- I'm sure she'll love it.

1039
01:31:35,124 --> 01:31:38,014
Oh... fuck me.

1040
01:31:39,669 --> 01:31:41,398
Hey! Fuck me!

1041
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:48,528
Hey, bud!

1042
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:53,038
I just wanted to say thank you.
I'm sorry it came down to all this.

1043
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:56,081
Don't mention it.

1044
01:31:57,522 --> 01:32:00,287
Just make sure
you take care of this little guy.

1045
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:03,696
He's one tough cuss.

1046
01:32:07,113 --> 01:32:09,593
Sorry we didn't get the fucker.

1047
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:12,235
That's all right.
Carlos will get his.

1048
01:32:16,499 --> 01:32:21,825
Hey, man, you think I could have
a minute? I ain't going nowhere.

1049
01:32:22,214 --> 01:32:23,898
All right.

1050
01:32:25,843 --> 01:32:29,006
Hey, stop that.

1051
01:32:33,393 --> 01:32:35,634
You're an Oodie now.

1052
01:32:38,146 --> 01:32:41,515
Make sure this shit
didn't go down for nothing.

1053
01:32:41,818 --> 01:32:43,820
Yeah.

1054
01:32:48,659 --> 01:32:50,707
Thank you.

1055
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:57,541
Well, ain't that some E.T. shit?

1056
01:33:00,713 --> 01:33:03,159
You know Brick's gay, right?

1057
01:33:04,883 --> 01:33:07,330
See ya, Rob.

1058
01:33:18,355 --> 01:33:21,006
The hits just keep on coming.

1059
01:33:29,284 --> 01:33:31,935
No matter how this thing plays out...

1060
01:33:34,706 --> 01:33:36,708
...I'm proud of you boys.

1061
01:33:46,593 --> 01:33:50,564
You busy? Goddamn it!

1062
01:33:50,972 --> 01:33:53,863
Is there anything I can get you?

1063
01:33:57,729 --> 01:34:00,540
- What?
- I have a package for Carlos Lyman.

1064
01:34:00,817 --> 01:34:02,467
- Please sign here.
- I ain't signing shit.
