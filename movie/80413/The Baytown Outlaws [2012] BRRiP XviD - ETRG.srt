4
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,046
Whoo!

5
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,164
Open up!

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,644
It's your dog, bro!

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,806
We've got a warrant
for a Hector De la Taco.

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,724
So send him on out.

9
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,525
You've got the wrong house, <i>ese.</i>

10
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,364
Why don't you let me worry about
that there, snookum?

11
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,408
This is the FBI! Why the fuck don't you
open the fucking door? Let's go!

12
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,602
That's cute. Look! You putas got ten
seconds to get the fuck off my stoop!

13
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,047
<i>- OK?
- "Putas"?</i>

14
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,282
Hey, man! You know what, man?
We got off to the wrong foot!

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,204
You're damn fucking right we did!

16
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,169
All right, man! Just take a step back

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,845
and take another look
at our credentials!

18
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,205
Officer McQueen, would you please show
this nice young gentleman your badge?

19
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,565
I can't see shit!

20
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,005
Whoo!

21
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,641
You ain't gonna need this no more.

22
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,404
Stop it! If you had bothered
to learn the language,

23
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,284
you know what you could
be saying to me right now?

24
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,364
Do you know what you could be saying?
You could be saying, "Hey, man",

25
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,929
this is a big mistake.
I'm a <i>Federale.</i> I've got a wife!

26
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,890
"I got a wife and I got a kid at home!
Please don't let me die!"

27
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,926
But that's all you want to do!
Talk in your jibber-jabber.

28
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,846
That would be like me going to Mexico
and expect everybody to speak American.

29
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,249
God Almighty! I mean, what am I...?

30
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,165
You tell me what I'm supposed to do.
What am I supposed to do?

31
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,642
All right, you've got a job. Right?
You clean toilets, or cut grass,

32
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,003
or whatever the hell it is you do.
This is what I do.

33
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,845
I shoot people in the face.
You understand?

34
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,483
Somebody wanted you gone, you know
who they came to. This guy right here.

35
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,480
You know? So I'm sorry.
But just so you know,

36
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,008
this ain't nothing personal. All right?

37
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,164
You ain't gonna believe this.

38
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,089
Yeah?

39
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,044
We got the wrong house.

40
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, this shit ain't
gonna turn out well!

41
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,370
You don't listen, man! You're
like MacGruber! Goddamnit, man!

42
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,521
Well, ain't that some shit.

43
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,686
- Sheriff?
- What's the story?

44
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,811
It's just an all-out massacre.
Thirteen dead bodies, mounds of drugs,

45
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,442
- guns, spit and ass. It's a mess.
- So who were these miscreants?

46
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,251
No one appeared to be anybody special.

47
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,289
Just run-of-the-mill
dealers and bangers.

48
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,046
- Anybody talking?
- Ah, you know how it is.

49
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,124
Nobody heard nothing, nobody saw
nothing, and nobody talks to the po-po.

50
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,691
Yeah, that sounds about right.

51
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,451
Fill out all the necessary paperwork,
run the bodies through the county.

52
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,762
Have the report on my desk.

53
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,123
Sir, I also took the liberty to go
ahead and put it out over the wire.

54
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,770
See if we can get
a bead on these shooters.

55
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,606
- Now, why would you go and do that?
- Trying to speed things along.

56
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,046
Oh!

57
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,522
- You think I can't do my job.
- I just thought...

58
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,331
Don't do that! Don't ever do that.

59
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,721
Just do as you're told.

60
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,205
- nothing?
' Nope!

61
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,162
- Not even half?
- Mm-mm.

62
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,087
Something's gotta change!
Risking our necks for no money.

63
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,971
This some bullshit!

64
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,205
I'm about tired of us getting fucked
six ways from Sunday, you hear me?

65
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,046
Goddang, man!

66
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,170
I was gonna put a pool in
with that money.

67
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,007
Goddang, motherfucker!

68
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,440
Stop! Yeah, walk away, bitch!

69
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,683
You lucky I ain't in the mood
to whip your ass, boy!

70
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,525
Wasting food, motherfucker.

71
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,807
- Can I help you?
- Oh, shit!

72
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,129
- Sorry. You scared me.
- That's what I do.

73
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,723
I'm Celeste. I was hoping to talk
to you and your friends.

74
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,123
Friends? I ain't got no friends.

75
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,011
I've got my brothers.

76
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,801
Got my house. My car.

77
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,691
I've got a sexy little chica
standing in front of me.

78
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,288
But I ain't got no friends.

79
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,123
You wanna be my friend?

80
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,965
I saw you this morning.

81
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,925
I was hoping
to acquire your services.

82
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,088
You got the wrong fellas.
We was at church this morning.

83
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,129
- Really?
- Yeah.

84
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,487
So there's just three other white boys
that looked just like you

85
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,881
that ripped up a whole house
on Bacon Street?

86
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,249
Trying to figure out how you guys walked
out of there with all those witnesses.

87
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,563
And every cop in the state
isn't lined up at your door.

88
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,411
So, what's a pretty little girl like you
doing in a neighbourhood like that?

89
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,250
- Well, I was there to hire muscle...
- Hire him to do what?

90
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,564
Get my godson back
from my ex-husband.

91
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,764
Dibs.

92
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,209
Dang it! Cock-blocking motherfucker!

93
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,691
Lady, I'm not sure what it is
you think you're doing,

94
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,765
but that's not exactly
our line of expertise.

95
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,651
- I got money.
- How much?

96
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,121
Ten thousand.

97
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,724
Yeah, I don't think
saving people is really for us.

98
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,121
You know? Why don't you
take that shit to the cops?

99
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,766
They'll do it for free.

100
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,968
Twenty-five thousand.

101
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,205
Five thousand up front.

102
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,287
Come on inside and meet the boys.

103
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,409
This is what I'm talking about.
Clean lines, nothing to profile.

104
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,166
None of that spinner,
hydraulic shit to get you lit up.

105
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,210
What I'm talking about, Sal, is you
transporting anything and everything

106
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,126
in this pre-owned Hyundai Sonata.
And here's the reason why.

107
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,089
Hidden compartment. Coated
with coffee bean and talcum paste

108
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,402
no drug dog on the planet Earth
can sniff out.

109
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,961
This space is worry-free,
and this time next month,

110
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,202
I'm gonna have
a fucking fleet of them.

111
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,728
- Damn, that's tight.
- Hear that, Dad? It's tight.

112
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,206
So, what do you say, boys? You want
to take a few road trips for me?

113
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,687
Abso-fucking-lutely, Carlos.

114
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,371
We surely don't mind being your
fucking little mule, Don Carlos.

115
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,444
But we gotta talk about our cut.

116
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,971
We're the one doing all the risks.

117
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,845
You know, I just remembered something.
I need batteries and toilet paper.

118
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,570
And I need to get that Brad Pitt movie.

119
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,604
The one where he turns back
into a fucking baby?

120
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,770
Running low on milk, a few things.

121
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,209
I wonder where I could get all these
items in one convenient location?

122
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,003
- Walmart.
- Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

123
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,731
I love the way you put "fucking"
in the middle of a word like that.

124
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,281
I'm gonna start using that shit.

125
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,443
You see, guys, I kind of, uh...

126
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,491
...look at my future empire as the
Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

127
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,210
But, you know,
we can't all be Sam Walton.

128
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,721
That's my job.

129
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,924
And when my foot soldiers
start talking about shit like cuts

130
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,801
and percentages and things like that,
well, see, that's partner talk.

131
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,884
And I don't need a partner.

132
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,284
I need stockers and cashiers
and mercenaries and mules.

133
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,329
And in your case, Padre,

134
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,046
dime-bag dealers
from the lawn and garden department.

135
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,601
Coincidentally, where I found you.

136
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,368
Now, Padre, I like you. I really do.
I like your son too.

137
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,364
I really appreciate all the shit
you've done for me, you know,

138
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,602
that God wouldn't be proud of.

139
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,971
But some things, you just have
to stop them before they start.

140
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,282
See, partnership leads to ambition.

141
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,887
Ambition leads to a word
they don't use much any more.

142
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,603
Mutiny.

143
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,249
- Papa, what's that?
- It's bad news.

144
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,688
Listen up, dipshits!
This here is Celeste.

145
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,925
And she'd like to give us an assload
of money to kidnap her godkid back

146
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,890
from her deadbeat ex-husband.
That about cover it?

147
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,122
- I guess so.
- Well, OK.

148
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,521
Let me just find my
missing persons report here,

149
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,081
and I'll get you right set up.

150
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,971
You out your damn mind, brother?

151
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,646
The big fellow over there,
that's Lincoln.

152
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,371
The mouthy little faggot here
is McQueen.

153
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,164
And I'm Brick.

154
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,769
Did you happen to mention that
kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

155
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,571
I was there this morning.

156
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,924
You was at church?

157
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,408
When I saw you guys take out that whole
house and walk out without a scratch,

158
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,562
I knew I found my guys.

159
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,526
<i>Bull sheet. What the catch?</i>

160
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,650
Yeah. Why didn't you just
go to the cops with this?

161
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,484
His voice box was crushed
when he was a kid. He can't talk.

162
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,409
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

163
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,171
Why would he go and do
a dumb thing like that?

164
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,129
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

165
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,408
I just want to get Rob
and take him away from all this shit.

166
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,326
- That window closes Tuesday night.
- Do we look like FedEx to you?

167
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,448
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

168
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,170
- Shut up, man.
- You shut up.

169
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,010
I'm talking to the lady.
Shut up, man!

170
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,326
- Shut up!
- I just want peace of mind.

171
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,209
That's something the cops can't give me.

172
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,285
- And you think we can provide that?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,046
If he's arrested, he'll just get out
in 18 months and hunt me down.

174
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,680
This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

175
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,161
It is now. She just gave us
25,000 reasons to open up shop.

176
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,284
Five up front.

177
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,082
Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

178
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,764
It's a chance.

179
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,089
You wanted to be the last
true family man, Clark.

180
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,685
OK.

181
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,528
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

182
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,446
We'll even get your kid back.
But if this man, this, uh...

183
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,366
- Carlos.
- If he's as crazy as you say he is,

184
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,569
then why didn't he just kill
you in the first place?

185
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,929
He tried.

186
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,691
So when you leave,

187
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,923
it would be great if Lincoln
could put a boot through his skull.

188
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,640
You ladies have any other questions?

189
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,365
Henry, there's someone
in the back for you. In your office.

190
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,367
- Who?
- Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

191
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,330
- Cute, too.
- Yeah. Thanks for that.

192
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,642
I'll be sure to freshen up
before I go in.

193
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,565
Agent Reese. Henry Millard.

194
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,690
- Pleasure, sir.
- Well...

195
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,690
- We don't see suits in here much.
- Yeah, I can see why.

196
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,402
- How do people move in this heat?
- At our own pace.

197
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,087
So...
what can I do you for?

198
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,723
Well, I wanted to ask you a few
questions regarding the shootout

199
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,524
that occurred earlier today.

200
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,967
We think we may have a lead
on some suspects.

201
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,486
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

202
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,447
It was a... It's an interesting region
you have over here.

203
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,928
It seems every few months there's
a large number of violent offenders

204
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,721
that go missing or show up dead,
but there's never any leads.

205
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,329
Cases just... go away.
It's very weird.

206
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,929
Well, I guess around here
finding justice for murderers

207
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,724
isn't a top priority.

208
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,561
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers?

209
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,281
I know all, son. But I can see you
came prepared for show and tell.

210
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,523
So... get with the getting.

211
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,604
All right. Prime suspects!

212
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,966
Case dating back to their father,
Jonathan Warren Oodie,

213
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,727
or Johnny Boy Oodie, as he was called.

214
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,201
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

215
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,842
Apparently, in his mid-twenties,
Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

216
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,449
<i>Made things very colourful for local
law enforcement back in the day.</i>

217
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,961
<i>Flash-forward, KKK just about
dumbed themselves out of existence</i>

218
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,891
<i>and Johnny Boy went out
in a blaze of glory</i>

219
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,924
<i>during a federal drug raid
in March of '86.</i>

220
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,567
<i>No known mother to speak of, which
makes these three a Christmas miracle.</i>

221
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,166
<i>Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?</i>

222
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,529
<i>There were no grandparents or kin
suitable to take the children in,</i>

223
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,251
<i>so they were sent into foster care.</i>

224
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,088
<i>Then, when they became of age, they
started to become everyone's problem.</i>

225
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,369
<i>The oldest is Brick.
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.</i>

226
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,962
<i>Can't seem to stay out of trouble.
And boy, does he love his guns.</i>

227
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,802
<i>Then it looks as though they tried
to go legit for a minute.</i>

228
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,170
<i>So they put their middle brother,
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.</i>

229
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,443
<i>He ended up killing
seven men in the ring. And guess what?</i>

230
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,321
<i>Absolutely nothing was done about it.
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,</i>

231
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,327
<i>saying it was accidental and part
of his neck-breaking gimmick.</i>

232
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,723
<i>And to make this giant fucker
even freakier, he cannot talk.</i>

233
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,082
<i>Or at least he couldn't
last time anybody checked.</i>

234
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,528
<i>Wrestled under the name
the Dixie Reaper.</i>

235
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,485
<i>And then there's McQueen.
Practically illiterate.</i>

236
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,489
<i>He's the baby of the brood.
He was well on his way</i>

237
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,444
<i>to becoming</i> a <i>real-life G. I. Joe.</i>

238
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,211
<i>But he's got a bit of an issue
with authority.</i>

239
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,200
Whoo!

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,607
That's a mighty fine
detective job you've done, son.

241
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,810
- Thank you, sir.
- But... it ain't as easy as all that.

242
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,646
- So you do know the Oodie Brothers?
- Like I said, I know all.

243
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,486
I can't just bring them boys in 'cause
some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

244
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,203
Well, you can if some suit

245
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,160
from Chicago tells you to.

246
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,890
The longer you stay down here,
the more you're going to realise,

247
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,771
we don't like being
told what to do, son. Now...

248
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,049
...if you'll excuse me,
I got other work to attend to.

249
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,489
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking
for, you know, a little cooperation.

250
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,722
Once this thing gets wrapped up,
I'll get out of your hair.

251
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,609
Why don't you let me
worry about my county?

252
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,447
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

253
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,410
I'll drive us
until I can't drive no more.

254
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,410
Can you believe she went ahead
and paid us five grand up front?

255
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,523
I know, right?

256
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,647
I mean, you'd think she'd have
some trust issues, right?

257
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,644
- But hey, each to their own.
- Each to their own, man.

258
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,201
Each to their own.

259
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,922
Now, I know we've got
an address to Austin,

260
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,323
but shouldn't she have given us like
a picture of the kid or something?

261
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,244
How many kids you reckon
they got up there?

262
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,482
I mean,
they ain't running a day-care centre.

263
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,322
- OK.
- Yeah.

264
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,806
What if we get there
and Rob's a baby?

265
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,850
Well, if he's a baby,
they got baby junk up there.

266
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,048
- Oh, that's smart.
- It's not like they're riding around

267
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,682
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing.
I mean, come on.

268
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,845
Besides that, them bullet scars didn't
look too fresh on Celeste's belly.

269
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,570
- You're right. You're right.
- Yeah.

270
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,963
- What if there's more than one kid?
- Why are you asking me so many

271
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,970
goddamn questions, man?
We just went over this! What?

272
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,162
What do you want to know?!
What do you want to know?!

273
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,722
- How will we know which is Rob?
- I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

274
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,241
How about that? I'm gonna say,
"You know what, I don't want Kevin!

275
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,289
I don't want Michael!
No, I don't want Stephen!"

276
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,091
If there's a bunch of fucking kids
around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!"

277
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,811
How about that?
Fucking hell, man!

278
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,042
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

279
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,602
We smash whoever's in front of us
and we take Rob!

280
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,285
Damn! Plain and simple!
What? Sorry, Lincoln.

281
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,245
- I don't know why you have to yell...
- Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

282
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,761
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

283
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,605
Where'd you learn that word?
Inquisitive?

284
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,924
- Where the fuck did you pick that up?
- It's in my lexicon, man!

285
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,009
- Jackass. Yeah?
- I've got it up here.

286
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,645
There's a lot you
don't know about me.

287
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,847
Are you ready for a potty break?

288
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,530
How many books you read, motherfucker?

289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,447
- Where are we?
- We're in Crockett.

290
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,884
Davy Crockett. What time is it?

291
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,088
Four

292
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,286
Hey.

293
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,043
Hm... I guess there's
a little candy in every piñata.

294
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,440
Shh.

295
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,970
Got some free shit!

296
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,602
Take it easy, Van Damme! Hey.

297
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,411
Hadji at the front desk said
we're only a few hours from Austin.

298
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,086
- Nice!
- Whoo! Ow!

299
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,251
- Who that?
- Fuck. Who do you think?

300
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,880
Don't answer that shit, man!

301
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,249
Don't answer it. Don't you...

302
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,488
- Hey.
- Hey?

303
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,883
Don't hey me.
The hell are you?

304
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,485
<i>Texas</i>

305
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,449
Texas?

306
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,206
Well, what in the Sam Hill could
you possibly have to do in Texas?

307
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,567
Hey, man. Check this out.

308
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,167
<i>Permian Stadium from
Friday Night Lights. It's on the</i> way!

309
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,924
I took a job out here.

310
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,243
Oh, you took a job!
Well, excuse me.

311
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,122
What was I thinking? I forgot you guys
are freelance artists. So, Mr Brick,

312
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,568
<i>- what job did you take?
- Look, it's not a big deal, man.</i>

313
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,728
All right? It's just a little gig
out here. We can handle it.

314
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,008
<i>Oh, you're going to handle it
like you handled me yesterday?</i>

315
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,446
<i>It's bad enough you can't
check a damn address,</i>

316
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,927
<i>but you also got to lay them
pork chops out in my backyard?</i>

317
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,764
<i>- Put it on our tab.
- What was that?</i>

318
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,764
- Nothing!
- You watch your mouth, son.

319
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,242
This ain't a joke. This little misstep
is gonna be a pain for me,

320
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,402
but you may have just stuck
your dick in a hornet's nest.

321
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,164
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

322
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,243
<i>I've got some jackleg
ATF agent up my ass,</i>

323
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,482
looking to make a name
for locking up you idiots.

324
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,087
The last thing I need is for you dumb
shits to draw more unneeded attention.

325
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,450
I mean it, Brick. I better not hear shit
about your little Texas job.

326
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,931
Keep your ass off the grid.

327
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,048
<i>Don't call my house.
Write this number down.</i>

328
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,966
<i>And for the love of God,
get rid of that damn cell phone.</i>

329
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,724
- Yes, sir.
- Damn well better.

330
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,407
You mess around and fuck up
my pension, that's your ass.

331
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,049
I don't even know you.

332
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,720
Hey!

333
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,406
Check it out, man!
Permian Stadium!

334
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,087
It's on the way, man!
You want to win, put bubba in!

335
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,129
It's not on the way, jackass.

336
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,011
It is, man! It's Odessa, Texas!

337
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,924
Huh?

338
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,444
Man! Don't take it out on me
because you got your ass chewed.

339
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,364
We got work to do, boys.

340
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,084
I'll get my badge.

341
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,090
No. I figured we'd do
the old Roosevelt slammer.

342
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,169
Fuck, yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

343
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,088
Dibs, bitch! Whoo!

344
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,245
Goddamn it, Montane! I didn't want you
to blow the place to hell and back.

345
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,802
I don't give a shit! Would you fucking
listen to me every now and then?

346
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,163
Please? Goddamn it.
Come here, baby. Come here!

347
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,324
I don't know if your mama told you,
but you are hotter than shit.

348
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,881
Goddamn.

349
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,330
Fuck.
That's the shit right there, boys!

350
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,689
From now on,
no more nickel and diming!

351
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,161
You get it? Only the finest!

352
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,324
- Hey, how come she's not naked?
- Don't know, boss.

353
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,762
Find out.

354
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,605
Hey. I'll call you when I need you.

355
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,091
All right. Bye.

356
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,651
Doesn't anybody know how
to use finesse any more?

357
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,527
You all right?

358
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,809
- The helmet ain't work for shit.
- I told you. Aah!

359
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,281
All right, you go east, I go west!

360
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,721
Plain and simple. Smash and grab.

361
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,844
Oh, shit.

362
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,729
My bad, lady. You OK?

363
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,764
In my defence,
you do work for an asshole.

364
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,210
You Rob?

365
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,168
Brick!

366
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,848
Goddang. Brick!

367
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,767
Goddamn it.

368
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,763
Fuck.

369
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,766
Oh, shit.

370
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,327
Boss! Boss, are you all right?

371
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,168
What the fuck
does it look like, Marty?

372
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,969
It looks like a fucking bomb went off.

373
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,721
Denny?

374
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,043
- What the hell happened?
- The kid.

375
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,682
- Say what?
- Three guys come in.

376
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,730
Yes, I know three guys came in!
They came all the fucking way in!

377
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,487
- I see that!
- They took the kid.

378
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,849
Fuck! Goddamn it!

379
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,481
They shot my motherfucking maid!

380
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,808
OK, Marty,
I know it's over a year ago,

381
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,806
but I need you to fucking think, OK?
You did kill Celeste, right?

382
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,200
You wouldn't lie to me about that shit,
would you?

383
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,648
I put three bullets in her gut.
She looked dead to me.

384
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,406
But you didn't check to see
if she was dead, did you?

385
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,205
Guess not.

386
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,523
That was our golden ticket,
you stinking fuck!

387
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,524
How am I going to pay for this?
You got the dough?

388
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,966
Hm?

389
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,007
You got a fucking piggy bank
in your fat ass?

390
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,851
Sorry, boss.

391
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,524
OK. As long as you're sorry, I guess
that's all that matters, isn't it?

392
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,365
I'll take care of it, boss. I'll make
sure it's right. I'll take care of it.

393
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,010
Good, good. Thanks, thanks.

394
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,607
Yeah. Hand me my goddamn pills,
will you?

395
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,602
You still want to go look at that car?

396
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,482
That Carlos man make you cripple?

397
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,884
<i>Hi, buddy.</i>

398
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,490
I don't think he can talk.

399
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,044
- Well, ain't this some shit, man.
- What?

400
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,089
That he's all, you know...

401
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,162
- Don't do that shit!
- What?

402
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,721
'Cause you're being mean!
He can't help it.

403
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,841
You OK?

404
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,323
You hurt?

405
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,846
You OK? He can understand us.

406
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,482
How the hell did you get
"I'm OK" from that?

407
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,683
Hey, look, buddy. We ain't going
to hurt you, all right? Celeste sent us.

408
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,889
You know Celeste?

409
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,326
Huh?

410
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,168
Yeah! There he goes!
See? He understands us just fine.

411
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,767
Once again, how the hell do you
know what he's saying?

412
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,445
You the tard whisperer?

413
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,965
You say that again,
I'm gonna kill you.

414
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,282
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- Say it again. You are making fun.

415
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,205
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- You are making fun of him.

416
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,489
It's just a little weird that she didn't
mention the poor little fella's

417
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,881
- all buggered up, you know?
- It don't matter.

418
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,647
She sent us to get Rob.
We got Rob. All right?

419
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,242
You good, buddy?

420
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,131
- I wasn't being mean.
- You were being mean!

421
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,044
You were making fun of him.

422
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,490
Bless his heart.
He ain't got no control over that.

423
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,610
It's a damn good thing
he wasn't in the living room.

424
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,366
I'm just saying.

425
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,924
Hm-mm.
Yeah, we can do that.

426
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,968
Oh, we can get that done.

427
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,762
All right, Carlos. I'm just
finishing up a little something here.

428
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,489
Then we'll get on the road.
Don't you worry about a thing, sweetie.

429
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,130
Excuse me, councilman.

430
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,646
What? He wanted a bath.

431
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,649
Another one already?
I didn't even get off.

432
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,771
- It's for Carlos.
- Well, that makes it a bit better.

433
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,123
Doesn't get much better
than this, Bill.

434
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,330
It'd be better than this if the fish
was biting as well as these chiggers.

435
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,442
You gotta be shitting me.

436
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,921
This is where the real police matters
are handled, huh?

437
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,323
Oh, you mean on private property?
Yeah, sometimes it is.

438
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,608
Anthony Reese, ATF.

439
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,207
- Bill Hawkins. Nice to meet you.
- Bill's a representative for the state.

440
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,203
Ah, nice to meet you, sir.

441
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,081
Bill, have you heard about an
investigation going on in our area?

442
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,480
No, I haven't.

443
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,689
It seems Agent Reese was sent
down here to check up on us.

444
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,490
Seeing as he's an Ivy League grad,

445
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,762
I guess that makes him
better at our jobs than we are.

446
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,001
Oh, is he now?

447
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,210
No. I'm not trying to intrude,
only assist.

448
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,807
Sheriff, I feel
like we got off on the wrong foot.

449
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,611
We're on the same team.
I don't want it to feel like

450
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,888
I'm infringing on your territory.
I just...

451
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,769
I really think we have something
with these Oodies.

452
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,241
We don't talk business
when I'm fishing, son.

453
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,687
When I'm about to cast.
Don't get hooked!

454
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,769
We can, however, talk all
about it tomorrow at my office.

455
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,043
It don't excite me that some
Yankee's come down here

456
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,362
imposing his authority
on one of my best friends.

457
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,762
This county has the lowest crime rate
in the state, last time I checked.

458
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,285
- Uh-huh.
- I know you Democrats

459
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,885
think we need your help,

460
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,602
but I'm here to tell you that we don't.
Bad enough I've gotta fight you in D.C.

461
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,810
Now you can just ease your way out
of here the same way you eased in.

462
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,964
I'd like to enjoy what's left
of my afternoon.

463
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,883
Alrighty, then.

464
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,086
Why don't you go back home
to that wife of yours?

465
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,881
It must be hard raising
a baby all by herself.

466
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,001
<i>Oh, yeah! Yeah!</i>

467
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,124
- Pretty classy joint you've got here.
- Thanks. Nice shirt.

468
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,804
- You Lucky?
- That's right.

469
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,962
Let's see about that.

470
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,361
Hey, man, why don't you
turn that shit off back there for me?

471
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,922
That's Mac. He's 98 years old.
I think he's earned the right

472
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,321
to watch a little T and A if he wants.

473
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,847
Why? He ain't jerking nothing.

474
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,321
Yeah, well, he's been watching that
stuff since I opened the joint,

475
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,324
so I'm gonna keep it that way,
all right?

476
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,448
Well, how about this?

477
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,766
If I go back there, I'm gonna bust
up Mac and your TV. How about that?

478
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,645
Yeah, is that a fact?

479
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,771
- What the fuck?
- See, I got a minor with me.

480
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,208
I'd appreciate it if he wouldn't
have to listen to that.

481
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,003
Hey, Mac, I'm gonna give it
a rest for a second, all right?

482
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,849
<i>I'm looking for
a friend of mine. Terry.</i>

483
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,001
Macky?

484
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,248
I'm gonna give it a rest!

485
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,244
Mac.

486
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,724
Say, Mac. Mac?

487
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,368
It looks like Mac finally
had enough.

488
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,648
Hey, man.

489
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,402
<i>Let me guess.
This is the part where you say</i>

490
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,809
<i>you'll be back. Am I right?</i>

491
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,526
<i>I'll be back.</i>

492
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,042
You know this movie?

493
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,681
<i>I'll be back.</i>

494
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,610
<i>I'll be back.</i>

495
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,285
Well, ain't you full of surprises?

496
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,485
Hey, this is Lucky. Yeah, listen,
I need an ambulance down here, OK?

497
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,371
It seems like Mac's passed on, OK?

498
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,842
You got anything to eat back there
besides the bar food bullshit?

499
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,244
- I have to go get it.
- Well, rustle something up, man.

500
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,165
I need something for the kid, please.
We're in a big hurry if you don't mind.

501
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,243
Oh, yeah? You running from something?

502
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,363
Goddamn.

503
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,851
How's it going, ladies?
Need something to drink?

504
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,480
Don't know what we'd like yet.

505
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,809
All right. Well,
you let us know when you do.

506
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,644
Looking real good up in here.

507
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,802
Watch this.

508
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,170
Dibs.

509
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,208
Name's McQueen.

510
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,926
What's your name?

511
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,570
Can I buy you a drink?

512
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,361
Her name is Jez.
And you can buy us a drink.

513
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,329
Lucky? Can I get us some beers
for my new friend Jez.

514
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,802
And her ladies. And that kid's
still waiting on his food.

515
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,883
I'll be right back.

516
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,247
Figure it out.

517
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,281
What's your story?
And I'm gonna pretend I'm listening.

518
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,602
Damn bullshit!
Don't want the kid seeing porn,

519
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,202
but when some sweet tail walks in,
they forget all about that, right?

520
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,366
First time in four years I got
some sweet, fresh snapper come in here,

521
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,967
and I'm down here making fucking
sandwiches for the Road Warriors?

522
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,610
Kiss my fucking ass!

523
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,084
Hm...

524
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,726
Wanna dance?

525
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,168
About damn time.

526
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,729
Not like that.

527
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,211
Um...

528
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,050
Not like that either.

529
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,524
Brick?

530
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,728
<i>Is that the Big Whopper
or the Ponytail?</i>

531
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,281
<i>- By the way, Marty says hi.</i>

532
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,927
Yeah? Well, tell Marty, "Fuck you."
I see you dodged another bullet.

533
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,491
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

534
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,201
These days, baby,
I can get just about anything I want to.

535
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,365
For instance, right now I'm
getting back my paycheque on wheels

536
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,684
<i>- from those amateurs you sent.
- Moneygrubbing piece of shit!</i>

537
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,161
What happened to us, baby?
We were good once, weren't we?

538
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,642
Fuck you! We were never good.
I got played and that's that.

539
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,528
Whoa. Hang on a second.
Anybody got played, it was me.

540
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,690
I thought I had a bitch
that was down with this shit.

541
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,808
<i>You killed his parents, you psycho!</i>

542
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,440
And it makes me sick that
I brought you into their world!

543
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,847
Don't you think they're just
a bad judge of character?

544
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,002
It ain't my fault all your
friends are richer than shit.

545
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,562
<i>And you know something? At the end
of the day, I think you knew.</i>

546
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,769
If I knew, I would have lit your
gutless ass on fire while you slept!

547
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,924
Now, there's
the feisty bitch I know!

548
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,924
I wish it hadn't
ended up the way it did.

549
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,364
But what's Clyde gonna do
if Bonnie crosses him and goes soft?

550
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,007
And besides, what does that
son of a bitch need money for?

551
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,606
I mean, how much can a wheelchair cost?
Two or three hundred dollars?

552
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,401
You lost, motherfucker!
Rob's coming back with me. Deal with it.

553
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,204
Now, girlie, obviously you
didn't learn the first time around.

554
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,806
Let me tell you
how this shit's gonna end.

555
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,807
<i>I sent some really awful bitches
to handle this situation.</i>

556
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,884
<i>Now, once they track down your fellas,
it's not gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

557
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,123
<i>It's gonna get fucking sexy.</i>

558
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,120
<i>They'll single them out,
divide them up, then thin the herd.</i>

559
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,602
<i>Each one will have
forgotten about everything,</i>

560
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,491
<i>except for the fine piece
of strange grinding on them.</i>

561
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,249
<i>Then, without warning,
their lives will be snuffed out</i>

562
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,367
<i>and the girls deliver Rob just in time
for me to plan the boy's 18th birthday.</i>

563
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,443
<i>You should have stayed dead, darling.</i>

564
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,650
<i>'Cause unless your name is Jesus,
you had no business coming back.</i>

565
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,689
<i>See you soon.</i>

566
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,045
Why don't you try a taste of me?

567
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,208
Well, hi, big guy.
Here's my boom stick.

568
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,329
Oh, shit!

569
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:44,001
Hey! Hey, don't be
fucking around up there!

570
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,250
Fuck!

571
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,209
Well, those girls were the longest
relationship I ever had.

572
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,367
You OK, bud? Huh?

573
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,207
All right, come on.
I wanna move. Let's go.

574
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,970
Lucky's about to get lucky
up in this motherfucker.

575
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,090
Do this shit right.
I'm gonna do it all night.

576
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,282
I've got to pay to play.

577
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,808
Five girls like that come in there,
you've got to pay to play.

578
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,291
That pussy ain't free.

579
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,602
Don't you laugh at me.
I'm gonna make you work all this,

580
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,603
all this extra weight off me,
because all I've been doing

581
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,446
is eating fried chicken, baby,
and fried collards!

582
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,969
Fried! Everything fried!
I saw a man fry a Twinkie yesterday.

583

her damn heel off in my back.

But you can bet I'm gonna
call Celeste and find out.

593

Rambo time.

594
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,531
Now, you ain't gonna
get me back for this later?

595
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,364
Promise me now.

this is gonna hurt.

Drago.

<i>and appear to be highly dangerous.
If you see anyone</i>

604
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,722
<i>- fitting this description, please...
- Fuck me!</i>

605
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,087
Hey!

606
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,726
They did a really good job, didn't they?
It looks just like them too.

607
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,526
Look at that.
It was all over the news.

608
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,211
Sheriff, this is the first time
that evidence

609
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,603
has literally been
brought to my doorstep.

610
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,126
We were able to pick up
an address for them, too.

611
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,567
I'll have a search and seizure
here by noon.

612
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,768
And surprise, surprise!

613
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,287
It's located on a piece
of residential land

614
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,684
here in your county, Sheriff.
Can you believe that?

615
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,764
That sounds like a hell of a plan, son.
What can I do to help?

616
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,641
Well, I'm guessing half the roads that
get me there won't show up on my GPS.

617
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,964
So if you could do me a favour
and simply escort me to the property,

618
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,602
that would be fantastic.

619
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,002
Oh... You mean that old-ass
condemned shack out on Euleton?

620
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,245
Son, you didn't hear? Fire chief let the
volunteers burn that up for training.

621
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,801
- Burn it up for training.
- Yeah.

622
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,964
Yeah, I think it was scheduled
for early this morning.

623
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,088
Is that right?

624
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,405
- Well, I suggest you better stop them.
- I could call Chief Walters,

625
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,484
but I'm pretty sure ain't nothing
left out there but smoke and ash.

626
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,201
My! I'm really sorry about that.

627
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,966
It really sounded like you had
something there.

628
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,845
Motherfucker,
I'm done with you wasting my time.

629
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,606
I don't ever remember asking for it.

630
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,962
This good-old-boyjustice thing
you got going on,

631
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,203
letting the trash take out the trash,
saving tax dollars

632
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,806
by keeping the bottomfeeders
out of the system

633
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,203
so you can just go fishing all day,

634
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,488
that's a slippery slope
you're playing on.

635
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,120
It's gotten to the point where
you're no better than they are, Sheriff.

636
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,120
Yeah, I'd be careful if I was you.

637
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,961
Well, I'll take
that under advisement.

638
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,522
Shit.

639
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,962
Wake up.

640
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,761
Go get Rob something to eat.
I'm gonna call Celeste.

641
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,842
Ooh...
Found the mother lode, boy!

642
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,201
I'm gonna pay for it.
Don't worry. God.

643
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,929
You see, man, when you
open up something in the store...

644
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,007
...you have to pay for it.

645
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,527
No one taught me that
when I was young.

646
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,811
I learnt that one the hard way.

647
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,962
From the cops.

648
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,810
What?

649
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,011
What's wrong, man?

650
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,525
I don't know you mean
by all that squirming.

651
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,401
Help me out, bud. What you need, huh?
What you need?

652
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,043
You got to take a piss?

653
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,091
You're hungry. Goddamn,
of course you're hungry!

654
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:26,406
Let's get you something to eat, eh?
OK. Let's go.

655
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,483
Man!

656
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,925
It's like working out a riddle
every time talking to this boy.

657
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,287
Morning, sunshine! You know,

658
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,410
I don't remember crazy-ass biker chicks
being involved in our deal.

659
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,400
I don't remember leaving Carlos alive
in the deal either. ls Rob all right?

660
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,369
Fuck!

661
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,808
Yeah, he's probably scared
half to death, but he's fine.

662
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,201
- <i>Let</i> me talk to him.
- He's inside getting something to eat

663
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,044
with McQueen. Besides,
you and I got something to talk about.

664
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,924
<i>All right? What the hell
was that last night?</i>

665
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,681
I told you, Carlos would try to get
Rob back if you didn't kill him.

666
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,491
<i>What are you talking about? We killed
every motherfucker in that place.</i>

667
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,246
Well, evidently not, Brick!

668
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,562
All right. Why would a guy like
Carlos, what would he want to do

669
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,166
<i>with a kid in Rob's condition?</i>

670
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,962
Carlos killed Rob's parents,
and then lied to me about it.

671
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,726
<i>That might have been something
you wanted to mention.</i>

672
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,723
All right, look. I'm sorry.

673
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,963
Rob has a trust
that matures when he's 18,

674
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,842
and as legal guardians, we would
get him and eventually the money.

675
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,289
That too might be something that
you wanted to mention! Fuck!

676
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,207
Rob's trust matures next week and...
Carlos will do anything to get it.

677
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,887
<i>- Brick, you're all he's got.
- All right. New plan.</i>

678
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,051
- You meet us halfway.
- Fine. Where?

679
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,971
Vicksburg, Mississippi.
Big Bayou Campground.

680
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,641
I'll be there as soon as I can.

681
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,402
And if you lie to me again,
Carlos will be the least of your worries.

682
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,604
I already dropped five bitches.
I won't hesitate to make it six.

683
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,970
Now, you may have heard
of pig in a blanket,

684
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,600
but this here is a pig in the sun.

685
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,321
Whoo!

686
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,371
You want hair on your chest,
now, don't you? Strippers like it.

687
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,451
Hand me a napkin, man.

688
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,206
You all right?

689
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,287
Hey. Don't worry.

690
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,729
Don't worry, man.
Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

691
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,530
He's OK.

692
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,929
<i>...believed to be
responsible for the shooting</i>

693
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,320
<i>in a rural Texas bar.</i>

694
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,131
<i>They are travelling with a disabled
young man and believed to be</i>

695
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,723
<i>armed and dangerous. Do not
approach these men if you see them.</i>

696
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,408
Who wants a Snicker bomb, huh?

697
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,649
Think you can kidnap
some kid and get away with it?

698
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,203
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math,
five whore assassins

699
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,886
can't trump three retards
and a fucking cripple.

700
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,646
I mean, well,
according to my calculations,

701
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,882
they should be in your
area someplace by now.

702
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,202
But that's not my fucking job
to figure out, is it?

703
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,404
I mean, isn't owning
the road your goddamn job?

704
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,688
That's what I thought. OK.

705
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,446
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do.
Just get my boy back.

706
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,605
Yes! Get it done!

707
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,567
- Yeah?
- We're in a world of shit down here.

708
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,449
Yeah, and now it's
spilling over into mine.

709
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,331
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg,
Mississippi. OK?

710
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,690
- Big Bayou Campground. We could...
- Stop. Stop! Shut up!

711
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,207
Just shut the fuck up!
The less I know, the better.

712
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,807
- I taught you better than this!
- Look, I just thought that if,

713
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,689
you know,
we could run in and do a quick...

714
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,402
Don't do that! Don't get ideas!
Just do what the fuck I say!

715
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,801
Things ran smooth when we did that,
didn't it?

716
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,727
<i>I cleaned up your shit,
you took care of mine.</i>

717
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,962
I could have handled this hotshot.

718
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,731
But now this shit has gone public.

719
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,645
There's repercussions
to working for yourself.

720
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,929
- About time you learned that.
- Meaning what?

721
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,005
<i>I got to cut ties, Brick.
I cleaned up everything on my end.</i>

722
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,130
<i>So, what you do from now on
rests solely on your shoulders.</i>

723
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,285
<i>If you come back here,
I got no choice but to put you down.</i>

724
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,090
I got a family to protect.

725
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,928
I'll be sure to let the boys know
that we're on our own again.

726
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,082
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

727
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,643
Brick! We gots to go!

728
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,768
We made the news!

729
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,090
Hood Pirates! Mount up!

730
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,210
Whoo!

731
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,330
Give me that!

732
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,441
- You call Millard?
- Yeah.

733
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,131
Well, what did he say?

734
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,964
<i>The suspects
in question are believed to be.</i>

735
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,442
<i>- Brick Oodie and his two brothers...
- Nothing.</i>

736
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,922
<i>They hail from the Atmore area,
located in Montgomery, Alabama.</i>

737
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:08,129
They drew you to look like a fag.
Look at that.

738
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,250
What the fuck you do that for, man?

739
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,447
- What the fuck, man?
- Come on! Come on, huh?

740
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,647
- What are you do...?
- Come on!

741
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,484
I ain't gonna fucking hurt you,
you little faggot!

742
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,166
- Stop, man!
- Come on! Come here!

743
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,731
Want some? You want some?

744
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,282
- Fuck!
- What the devil got into you?

745
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,369
I fucked us.

746
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,731
How you mean?

747
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:46,211
Uh, let's see. Millard won't have
anything to do with us any more

748
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,682
'cause he can't clean up that mess
with the biker chicks down at the bar.

749
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,571
So now we can't go back to 'Bama.

750
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,724
And all of them son of bitches
we mowed down in Austin?

751
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,963
- Guess what we missed.
- Carlos.

752
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,883
And he ain't gonna stop neither.
He's already tracked down Celeste.

753
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,250
So now we gotta get him to fucking
Vicksburg so they can disappear.

754
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,124
Well...

755
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,806
This is getting better by the minute.

756
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,050
Now, I like that little fella
just as much as anybody.

757
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:28,769
But tell me something. Just give me one
reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

758
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,844
They ain't got no other options.

759
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,162
Hell, we ain't got
no other options either.

760
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,841
I mean, look at us.
We can't even take care of ourselves.

761
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,561
Has it ever crossed your mind

762
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,088
that maybe he stands
a better chance without us?

763
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,881
- It's just different.
- How's this different?

764
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,560
- It's just different!
- How the fuck is it different?

765
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,564
We had a brother...

766
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,891
...who passed away
before you can even remember.

767
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,241
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

768
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,244
He was all buggered up,
and he was in a wheelchair.

769
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,803
Daddy beat his ass every single day.
Treated him like a dog.

770
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,841
And there's nothing
we could do about it. Different.

771
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,487
Well, he gets a pass. I don't
understand why you didn't say nothing.

772
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,247
- How come you never said nothing?
- What do you want me to say to you?

773
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,449
I'm sorry, all right?

774
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,843
But ever since I've seen this fella,
I can't stop thinking about it.

775
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,369
How'd he die?

776
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,401
- How'd he die?
- I don't know.

777
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,887
He was there one day and gone the next.

778
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,527
I asked Daddy about it one time,
but that went over like a fart in church.

779
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,847
What was his name?

780
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,770
- They never named him.
- Fuck me.

781
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,204
Got them bitches! Dead ahead!

782
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,244
And this time, try not to hit
the motherfucking baby.

783
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,891
Here they come!

784
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,447
I'm giving it all she's got.

785
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,968
Monaco ain't got nothing left!
Strap in Rob! Here they come, boys!

786
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,122
What the hell is this motherfucker?

787
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,970
Hey, Rottweiler!
You better back the fuck up, mutt!

788
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,002
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

789
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,481
The kid's in the back!

790
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,961
Aah!

791
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,607
They took the kid!
I thought I told you to strap him in!

792
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,531
They took the fucking door, man!
I really don't think a fucking seatbelt

793
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,563
would have mattered right now! Go!

794
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,282
- Hey, he all right?
- How in the fuck do I know?

795
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,770
Here they come! Just like you said!

796
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,487
Hey! Help the driver.
You want to see this.

797
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,961
We're about to fuck
your babysitters up.

798
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,721
- Come on, boy!
- Whoo! Come on!

799
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,165
Welcome to the South, motherfuckers!

800
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,324
Whoo! What you got now, bitches?!

801
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,881
Time out, bitch!

802
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,050
No. No, indeed. Hell no.

803
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,328
- Do something, you're the brains!
- We've gotta figure something out!

804
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,130
What?!

805
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,523
- Top rope!
- Top rope!

806
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,608
Motherfuckers!

807
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,248
Whoo!

808
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,931
Get them, Lincoln! Come on!

809
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,169
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

810
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,448
Go get 'em!

811
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,570
They're slowing down!
They're slowing down!

812
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,490
Come on.

813
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,289
Lincoln!

814
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,049
We're good!

815
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,288
You all right, buddy?

816
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,242
You're one crazy redneck.

817
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,883
Trying to be a tough guy? Huh?
Running away from us?

818
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,171
You want one of these?
You've earned it.

819
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,848
- How's Linc?
- Not so good.

820
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,843
- What?
- You better check on him.

821
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,923
You got Rob?

822
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,125
Fuck.

823
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,441
You do all this?

824
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,529
By God.

825
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,409
It ain't your hat, bitch.

826
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,371
Good work!

827
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,807
Let me take a look.

828
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,962
Come on. Let me see it.

829
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,281
Shit!

830
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,768
Well, I think it's safe to say that, uh,

831
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,084
that surpasses McQueen's
level of doctoring.

832
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,651
<i>- Fine.
- You are not fine.</i>

833
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,246
We need to get that looked at.

834
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,449
- <i>Fine.</i>
- All right. You're fine.

835
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,568
Fine, my ass.

836
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,963
Fuck!

837
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,251
McQueen!

838
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,208
Montane! Montane,
where the fuck are you?

839
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,841
Shit.

840
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,170
Goddamn it!

841
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,206
Hey, you guys need a ride?

842
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,967
Who are these fucking people?!

843
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,928
Nah, man. We're good.
Just keep going.

844
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,362
Son of a bitch.

845
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:12,570
He practically made these monsters,
then hung them out to dry.

846
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,291
You gotta be kidding me.

847
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,364
And why aren't they working for me?!

848
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,647
Just get in the car.
I'm a nurse. I can help.

849
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,365
That ain't such a bad idea.

850
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,004
Bingo.

851
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,000
What happened here?

852
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,521
- I did that.
- The stabbing or the stitches?

853
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,287
- The stitches.
- Infection is setting in.

854
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,164
I poured whiskey on it.

855
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,283
Let me guess,
you saw that in a movie?

856
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,091
Yeah. Several.

857
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,644
Hey Hey, Rob?

858
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,168
You hold onto that, all right?
You know that's his prize possession.

859
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,688
He's gonna need it when
he gets to feeling better, OK?

860
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:22,202
<i>Chogan, this is Carlos.
I'm only calling as a last damn resort.</i>

861
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,801
<i>Some asshole took Rob
and I need you to kill him.</i>

862
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,167
<i>If you can, bring me back the kid,
and if not, then fuck it.</i>

863
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,601
<i>If I can't have him, nobody can.</i>

864
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,405
They're close.

865
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,369
Finish up!

866
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,968
He gonna be all right?

867
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,446
Like I said, it's up to you.

868
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,324
You look really familiar.

869
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,607
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

870
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,764
Do you stay in shitty motels?
'Cause we clean them.

871
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,766
Crockett.
That's where I've seen you.

872
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,968
Small world.

873
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,442
So why ain't you a nurse?

874
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,929
- Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.
- Why don't you become legal?

875
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,811
Your country doesn't
make it that easy for us.

876
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,007
What are you talking about?

877
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,811
Just go down to the place
and fill out your paperwork.

878
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,804
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal.
I mean, you speak the language.

879
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,850
That's more than most
of them do out here.

880
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,128
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

881
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,445
Yeah, well, I might
be just an ignorant redneck,

882
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,887
but at least I know who I am.

883
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,041
I mean, you're a nurse.
You ought to be helping people.

884
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,368
Not scrubbing toilets.

885
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,366
Well, is that why you do what you do?
'Cause it's who you are?

886
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,728
Let's just say it runs in the family.
You know?

887
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,642
Well, you're not gonna have
much family left at this pace.

888
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,569
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for us.

889
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,883
I can't say that I'd exactly
done the same thing, so...

890
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,009
You're welcome.

891
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,289
What would you say if...
if I offered you two grand

892
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,010
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi?

893
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,246
What do you say I convince you not
to do what you're about to do?

894
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,686
I could take you anywhere else.

895
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:58,487
Nah. This here's one of them
kind of deals, you know?

896
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,685
We kind of had people controlling
what we do our whole lives, you know?

897
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,008
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

898
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,161
- Please keep the kid safe for me.
- Nothing bad's gonna happen.

899
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,609
- We've just got a job to finish.
- I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

900
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,441
- Thank you.
- See ya.

901
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:18,561
See you around.

902
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,929
Can we still put a pool in
with three grand?

903
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,642
What you thinking?

904
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,049
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

905
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,163
But it's gonna be tough
with just two of us.

906
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,728
What you mean two?

907
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,767
That's fitting.

908
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,480
- You want to go high?
- No.

909
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,607
You go and run in the house.

910
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:25,563
No matter what you hear,
no matter what the people say,

911
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:30,248
Papaw did what he could to make things
better for you than he had. OK?

912
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,528
Go. Run along.

913
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,326
Dispatch told me you'd, uh...
you'd be here.

914
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:47,326
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea,
but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

915
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,324
It might be too strong for you.

916
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,686
Ah...

917
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:58,086
You know, of all
the Southern idioms and charms,

918
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,086
you know which one
I find the most helpful?

919
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,009
My extraordinary hospitality?

920
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,529
<i>The fact that nobody
ever throws anything away.</i>

921
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,402
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

922
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:19,329
There was nothing in any database
that ever connected you to them.

923
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,370
<i>Wasn't no computer
files back in the day.</i>

924
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,444
<i>Another perk of Alabama
being behind the times.</i>

925
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,324
<i>Paper trail easy as hell
to get rid of.</i>

926
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,051
Only thing this proves is that
a young deputy was doing his job.

927
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,844
Right, right, right.
Well, I figured you'd say that,

928
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:43,042
so I did a little further digging,
and I found this.

929
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,884
You missed some paper, Henry.

930
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,642
You signed for $1,200 dollars
on May 26th, '05,

931
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,167
$800 June 15th, '07,

932
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,891
$1,100 on February 3rd, '08.

933
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,162
And it goes on and on and on.

934
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,403
<i>That money was issued
for crime scene clean up.</i>

935
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:05,007
<i>And I can hire anybody
I damn well please.</i>

936
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,926
Well, since when do people get paid
to clean up a crime before it happens?

937
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,688
<i>You are right though, Sheriff.</i>

938
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,650
<i>You've got the lowest
crime rate in the state.</i>

939
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,483
You certainly weren't paying
them much though, were you?

940
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,484
It's no wonder
those dogs turned on you.

941
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:33,003
<i>Now, listen. This story,
you know, could end one of two ways.</i>

942
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,726
<i>You could either help me out,
cooperate...</i>

943
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,287
...or I could just arrest you
on the spot.

944
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,728
Take them down myself, eventually.

945
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,809
Look, either way,
I've got to take you to prison,

946
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:50,922
but you play nice, I'll see to it
that your sentence is shortened.

947
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,448
Maybe one day you'll be able to see your
granddaughter graduate from high school.

948
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,931
Let's consider it
a professional courtesy.

949
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,127
They get big quick on you.

950
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,926
You'll find that out sooner or later.

951
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,251
- Come with me.
- No, no, no. Come on.

952
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,721
- I don't think so.
- Cut that shit out.

953
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,201
Fighting's a young man's game.

954
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,970
- Where are you going, huh?
- Vicksburg.

955
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,567
If anybody's gonna put an end to this,
it's going to be me.

956
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,843
You know, I'm the one that ain't
supposed to be trusting you.

957
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,241
Y'all won the damn war.

958
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,570
Now this is the same face paint
that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

959
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,970
Solidifies you as one of us.

960
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,369
You scared?

961
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,362
You're an Oodie now.
You got to swallow that fear.

962
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,051
For what it's worth,

963
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,722
I think you deserve more
than what you've been through.

964
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,086
It ain't right,
people taking advantage of you

965
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,210
just because you can't help yourself.

966
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,844
I know you may not have had a lot of
people in your life you can look up to.

967
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,923
Hell, I ain't telling you
to look up to us.

968
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,731
I just want you to know that we're
going to do everything we can

969
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,245
to keep you from getting hurt.

970
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,931
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

971
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,009
My new lookout.

972
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,402
You've been promoted.

973
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,646
Hm.

974
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,644
Empty-

975
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,768
- That ain't much.
- It's gonna have to do.

976
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,204
Lincoln don't look so good.

977
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,162
Yeah, he's been better.

978
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,168
Hey.

979
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,848
You think she's gonna come
and see this thing through?

980
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,843
Or is she just gonna run
for the hills?

981
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,440
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

982
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,443
Yeah.

983
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,361
Why you reckon God
would make someone like him?

984
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,090
What?

985
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,647
Why would God let something
be wrong with him like that?

986
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,684
I don't know. Hell, man, I don't know.

987
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,571
Hell, why you asking me that, man?

988
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,367
I don't know.
Just been thinking about it.

989
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,529
I don't ask
why God made men like him.

990
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,851
I wonder why he made men like us.

991
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,846
How are the boys?

992
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,080
All right.

993
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,203
- Hey, Brick?
- Hm?

994
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,563
I'm starting to think we should
have finished school.

995
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,010
At least junior high.

996
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,366
It's almost over, bud.

997
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,561
- Oh, shit!
- McQueen!

998
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,127
A fucking arrow, man? Fuck!

999
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,610
Come on!

1000
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,686
Go!

1001
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,245
Move your ass, woman!

1002
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,882
- Shit.
- Where's Rob, Brick?

1003
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,610
He's safe!

1004
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,490
Stay right here.
I've gotta go get some ammo.

1005
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,687
- No! I'm going with you.
- Stay here!

1006
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,207
- I'm going with you!
- Fuck!

1007
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,165
- Come on, man!
- Go!

1008
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,687
- Grab a gun. Fuck.
- Take me to fucking Rob!

1009
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,285
You're keeping your ass here!

1010
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,206
That was a fucking arrow, man!

1011
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,881
Brick!

1012
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,847
Brick!

1013
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,083
Time out, motherfucker!
This ain't fun no more! Stop!

1014
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,528
Fuck me! Oh, shit.

1015
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,720
I told you to fucking stay here!

1016
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,046
You're really gonna say
I told you so right now?

1017
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,611
You mind yourself, woman!

1018
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,167
Shit!

1019
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,730
God!

1020
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,807
- Don't fucking move!
- Come out, come out.

1021
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,604
What you gonna do with that, huh?

1022
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,888
- McQueen!
- Hey!

1023
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:36,366
Hey! Hey!

1024
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,287
You're about to have
a bad day, John Redcorn.

1025
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,282
Remind me again who's
gonna have a bad day?

1026
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,247
Ain't that a sight.

1027
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:38,643
So, uh... you and your brothers
kidnapped the kid from, uh...

1028
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,770
...from Ms Martin, and you were
planning on holding him for ransom?

1029
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:46,050
- Yeah? All right.
- That's what I said.

1030
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:49,886
And what about these other men here?
Who are they? Huh?

1031
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,320
Hm?

1032
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,561
- Oh...
- All right. All right.

1033
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,286
You'll have plenty of time to think
about your answers in prison. Yeah?

1034
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,490
- Agent Reese?
- Special Agent Simmons! Hey!

1035
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,768
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1036
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,844
I'm very impressed
with how you navigated these waters.

1037
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,606
I'm putting in a request to have
you take over this territory.

1038
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,206
- No, no, no, no, sir...
- Don't worry about the details.

1039
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,330
We'll get everything handled. Cover
the moving expenses and everything.

1040
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,562
- But my wife...
- It's a fine place to raise a family.

1041
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,451
- Sir... I...
- I'm sure she'll love it.

1042
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,644
Oh... fuck me.

1043
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,009
Hey! Fuck me!

1044
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,129
Hey, bud!

1045
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,726
I just wanted to say thank you.
I'm sorry it came down to all this.

1046
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,724
Don't mention it.

1047
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,930
Just make sure
you take care of this little guy.

1048
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,321
He's one tough cuss.

1049
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,246
Sorry we didn't get the fucker.

1050
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,880
That's all right.
Carlos will get his.

1051
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:21,570
Hey, man, you think I could have
a minute? I ain't going nowhere.

1052
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,489
All right.

1053
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,682
Hey, stop that.

1054
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:35,241
You're an Oodie now.

1055
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:41,207
Make sure this shit
didn't go down for nothing.

1056
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,442
Yeah.

1057
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,328
<i>Thank you.</i>

1058
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,202
Well, ain't that some E.T. shit?

1059
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,811
You know Brick's gay, right?

1060
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,971
See ya, Rob.

1061
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:20,645
The hits just keep on coming.

1062
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,565
No matter how this thing plays out...

1063
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,322
...I'm proud of you boys.

1064
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:50,250
You busy? Goddamn it!

1065
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,524
Is there anything I can get you?

1066
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:00,164
- What?
- I have a package for Carlos Lyman.

1067
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,044
- Please sign here.
- I ain't signing shit.

1068
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,526
- Just give me the package.
- Are you all right, sir?

1069
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,364
Yeah, I'm fine. It's none
of your goddamn business.

1070
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,000
- You have to sign.
- Isn't that great?

1071
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:12,489
The fucking Postal Service is
concerned with my goddamn wellbeing.

1072
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,963
This better be a box
full of fucking cash.

1073
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:34,122
You bitch!

1074
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,247
What was that letter they gave you?

1075
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,528
Some work release bullshit, I...

1076
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,245
No.

1077
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:18,248
"Brick. I told you I'd settle up.
The truck's from Rob."

1078
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:21,284
Come to find out,
more people could use your help.

1079
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,962
"Check the bed and enjoy the toys.
Celeste."

1080
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,529
What truck?

1081
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,564
Damn!

1082
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:35,881
Whoo!

1083
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,245
I guess somebody forgot to tell me

1084
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,402
it was motherfucking Halloween
in the South today.

1085
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,562
That Asian one.

1086
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,367
Pink eyeliner on.

1087
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,962
I've got something pink,
and I'm swinging it real low.

1088
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:04,010
Swinging it real low.
I don't wanna hear any goddamn lip.

1089
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:09,326
It's a fucking bar. You want some
McDonald's, go to McDonald's.

1090
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:10,845
Make me a sandwich!

1091
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,765
I don't give a fuck what it is
as long as he just get to eat.

1092
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,605
Hey, shaggy!
Come on get the...

1093
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,524
We're gonna walk in here
and cause some shit!

1094
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,204
Get the fuck out of here,
you dumb, backwards-talking,

1095
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,362
motherfucking
<i>Sling</i> Blade-ass motherfucker.

1096
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,251
If my brother was here, you wouldn't
be talking that bullshit to me.

1097
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,926
I'll fucking kill your ass
and fuck Mac.

1098
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:35,369
Turn that porn off for me. I don't give
a fuck! Make a sandwich for you.

1099
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:38,530
Yeah, I'll be the biggest Jew-kicking,
motherfucking ass motherfucker

1100
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:41,365
you gonna ever see. Oh,
I ain't never seen a Jew that big!

1101
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:45,007
What the fuck am I gonna do with
him, Chuckabee? I don't know.

1102
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:48,323
When was the last time you went
to the dentist, motherfucker?

1103
01:36:48,648 --> 01:36:50,648
