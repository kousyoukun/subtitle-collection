17
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,212
为什么要替我们担心里面没有什么呢

Hey, man! You know what, man? We got off to the wrong foot!

你不需要它了
You ain't gonna need this no more.

35
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:58,546
消停点! 好好学学怎么说话
Stop it! If you had bothered to learn the language,

36
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,345
你知道你可以对我说什么吗
you know what you could be saying to me right now?

37
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,023
你知道你能说什么吗
Do you know what you could be saying?

38
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,305
你可以说,"嘿 老兄
You could be saying, "Hey, man,

39
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:05,325
这是个天大的误会

But that's all you want to do! Talk in your jibber-jabber.

43
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,738

全能的主啊! 我是说 我该怎么办...
God Almighty! I mean, what am I...?

46
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:26,109
你告诉我我该怎么办 我应该干嘛?
You tell me what I'm supposed to do. What am I supposed to do?

47
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:27,599
没错 你有工作

对吧? 你清理厕所 你割草
Right? You clean toilets, or cut grass,

49
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:32,668
你干什么都行 而我的工作

是爆头 懂吗
I shoot people in the face. You understand?

51
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,040
有人希望你永远地离开
Somebody wanted you gone,

52
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,863
你知道他们是冲谁来的 就是在这的那个家伙

53
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,661

You know? So I'm sorry. But just so you know,

54
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,063
这无关个人 好吗
this ain't nothing personal. All right?

55
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,111
你不会相信的
You ain't gonna believe this.

56
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,945
什么
Yeah?

57
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:54,790
我们真的找错了
We got the wrong house.

58
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:02,383
这破事要怎么解决
Oh, this shit ain't gonna turn out well!

59
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:03,525
没听见吗
You don't listen, man!

60
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:06,592
你就不靠谱得像百战天虫一样 该死!
You're like MacGruber! Goddamnit, man!

61
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:07,585
可不是么
Well, ain't that some shit.

62
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:32,786
- 警长   - 怎么回事
- Sheriff? - What's the story?

63
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,621
一个不留的大屠杀
It's just an all-out massacre.

64
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:36,746
十三具尸体 一堆堆的毒品
Thirteen dead bodies, mounds of drugs,

65
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:38,643
枪支 唾液还有混球 一团糟
guns, spit and ass. It's a mess.

66
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:40,228
什么人干的?
So who were these miscreants?

67
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:42,913
没人有什么可疑的地方
No one appeared to be anybody special.

68
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,876
只有几个普通的店家和几辆破车
Just run-of-the-mill dealers and bangers.

69
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,507
- 有证人吗   - 呃 你知道的
- Anybody talking? - Ah, you know how it is.

70
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,289
什么也没听见 什么也没看见
Nobody heard nothing, nobody saw nothing,

71
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,477
没人跟警察说话
and nobody talks to the po-po.

72
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:51,993
好吧 这听起来倒像那么回事
Yeah, that sounds about right.

73
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,440
写好必要的文件
Fill out all the necessary paperwork,

74
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:54,628
把尸体运走
run the bodies through the county.

75
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,836
报告放我桌上
Have the report on my desk.

76
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:00,185
长官 恕我擅自行动
Sir, I also took the liberty

77
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:01,998
继续查案以解决事件去了
to go ahead and put it out over the wire.

78
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,560
看看我们能不能揪出凶手
See if we can get a bead on these shooters.

79
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:05,604
为什么要这样做
Now, why would you go and do that?

80
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,236
加快案件的审理啊
Trying to speed things along.

81
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,629
哟
Oh!

82
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,857
你是说我的工作做不好咯
You think I can't do my job.

83
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:11,953
我只是想...
I just thought...

84
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,636
不要自作主张 什么都别做!
Don't do that! Don't ever do that.

85
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,952
就照我说的做
Just do as you're told.

86
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:26,037
- 什么事都没有?   - 是的!
- Nothing? - Nope!

87
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:30,795
- 一点都没追究?   - 嗯哼
- Not even half? - Mm-mm.

88
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:35,515
这不太对! 豁出了老命却一毛钱都拿不到
Something's gotta change! Risking our necks for no money.

89
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:38,279
胡说
This some bullshit!

90
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,059
这样的日子我已经厌烦了
I'm about tired of us getting

91
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,358
每天都在折腾却一无所获 听见没
fucked six ways from Sunday, you hear me?

92
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:46,041
该死
Goddang, man!

93
00:06:47,154 --> 00:06:49,998
我本来想泡在钱堆里的
I was gonna put a pool in with that money.

94
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,522
该死 混账东西
Goddang, motherfucker!

95
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:01,757
别吵了 走开 狗娘养的
Stop! Yeah, walk away, bitch!

96
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,886
小子 你该庆幸我现在没心情抽你屁股吧！
You lucky I ain't in the mood to whip your ass, boy!

97
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:07,607
又浪费粮食 混账
Wasting food, motherfucker.

98
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,288
- 需要帮忙吗?   - 噢 见鬼
- Can I help you? - Oh, shit!

99
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,364
- 抱歉 你吓到我了   - 效果不错
- Sorry. You scared me. - That's what I do.

100
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:55,299
我是Celeste
I'm Celeste.

101
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,611
我想跟你和你的朋友们谈谈
I was hoping to talk to you and your friends.

102
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,891
朋友们? 我可没什么朋友
Friends? I ain't got no friends.

103
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:04,649
只有一帮兄弟
I've got my brothers.

104
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:08,285
房子 车
Got my house. My car.

105
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:11,049
还有在我面前的面前迷人的小Chica
I've got a sexy little chica standing in front of me.

106
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,492
可我没朋友
But I ain't got no friends.

107
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,208
你想做我朋友吗
You wanna be my friend?

108
00:08:18,484 --> 00:08:19,974
今天早上的事我都看见了
I saw you this morning.

109
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,810
我想让你们也帮我做点事情
I was hoping to acquire your services.

110
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,734
那你找错人了 今天早上我们在教堂
You got the wrong fellas. We was at church this morning.

111
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:29,695
- 是吗   - 没错
- Really? - Yeah.

112
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:31,974
所以今天早上在Bacon街横扫整幢房子的
So there's just three other white boys that looked just like you

113
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:34,254
那三个白人小子只是长得像你们咯
that ripped up a whole house on Bacon Street?

114
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:35,512
好好想想 怎么多的证人
Trying to figure out how you

115
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:37,489
你们要怎么走出这个地方
guys walked out of there with all those witnesses.

116
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:40,651
还有那么多的警察 你们应付得来么
And every cop in the state isn't lined up at your door.

117
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,445
那么 你这么漂亮的女孩
So, what's a pretty little

118
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,928
在那么乱的街区去又是有何贵干呢
girl like you doing in a neighbourhood like that?

119
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,132
我是想去雇个壮汉...
Well, I was there to hire muscle...

120
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,614
雇他去干嘛
Hire him to do what?

121
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,780
从我前夫那要回我的儿子
Get my godson back from my ex-husband.

122
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,819
我先来的
Dibs.

123
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,974
畜生!混账!
Dang it! Cock-blocking motherfucker!

124
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:18,172
女士 我想你并不清楚你在做什么
Lady, I'm not sure what it is you think you're doing,

125
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:22,098
但那确实不是我们擅长的方向
but that's not exactly our line of expertise.

126
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:24,858
- 我付得起钱   - 多少
- I got money. - How much?

127
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,253
一万
Ten thousand.

128
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:32,618
而且我也觉得救人这种事不太适合我们
Yeah, I don't think saving people is really for us.

129
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,935
你干嘛不把这事交给警察去做呢
You know? Why don't you take that shit to the cops?

130
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:37,460
他们可不收钱
They'll do it for free.

131
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:39,582
两万五
Twenty-five thousand.

132
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:43,625
先付五千
Five thousand up front.

133
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:02,904
进来见见弟兄们吧
Come on inside and meet the boys.

134
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:18,245
这就是我要说的 流畅的线条 剖面光滑
This is what I'm talking about. Clean lines, nothing to profile.

135
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,041
也没有那种旋扣器
None of that spinner,

136
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:20,675
该死的会抬升汽车的液压装置
hydraulic shit to get you lit up.

137
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,228
Sal 我的意思是
What I'm talking about, Sal,

138
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,904
所有东西你都可以用这辆二手的现代索纳塔运
is you transporting anything and everything

139
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,666
这就是原因
in this pre-owned Hyundai Sonata. And here's the reason why.

140
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:32,424
隐藏的隔间 上面涂有咖啡豆粉和滑石膏
Hidden compartment. Coated with coffee bean and talcum paste

141
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,662
缉毒犬是闻不出来的
no drug dog on the planet Earth can sniff out.

142
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,107
完全不用担心 下个月的这个时候
This space is worry-free, and this time next month,

143
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,262
我要生产出一批这样的车
I'm gonna have a fucking fleet of them.

144
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,011
真是紧
Damn, that's tight.

145
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,630
听见了吗 爸 时间很紧
Hear that, Dad? It's tight.

146
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,321
那么 你们怎么想 弟兄们
So, what do you say, boys?

147
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:48,867
能帮我跑跑腿吗
You want to take a few road trips for me?

148
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,229
当他妈然啦 Carlos
Abso-fucking-lutely, Carlos.

149
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:54,308
我们当然不介意当你的骡子
We surely don't mind being your fucking little mule,

150
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:57,628
Don Carlos
Don Carlos.

151
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,593
我们得讨论讨论分成
But we gotta talk about our cut.

152
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,909
我们总是冒风险的那个
We're the one doing all the risks.

153
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,811
我刚刚想起点事
You know, I just remembered something.

154
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:09,590
我要电池和厕纸
I need batteries and toilet paper.

155
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,269
我还要那部布拉德皮特的电影
And I need to get that Brad Pitt movie.

156
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:14,189
大概是他变回婴儿的那部
The one where he turns back into a fucking baby?

157
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:17,189
没有足够的奶喝 之类的
Running low on milk, a few things.

158
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:18,901
我想知道我能上哪很方便地弄到
I wonder where I could get

159
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:21,475
所有的这些东西
all these items in one convenient location?

160
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,392
沃尔玛
Walmart.

161
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:27,030
沃他妈尔玛 就是这个
Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

162
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,001
我很喜欢你们这样
I love the way you put

163
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:29,632
把"他妈"放在每个词里
"Fucking" In the middle of a word like that.

164
00:11:29,786 --> 00:11:32,073
我以后也要这样说话
I'm gonna start using that shit.

165
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,110
你瞧 朋友们 我有点,呃...
You see, guys, I kind of, uh...

166
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,834
看我的未来帝国
...look at my future empire

167
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:40,914
就像看待沃尔玛的零售犯罪
as the Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

168
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:42,574
但我们不可能每个人都成为
But, you know, we can't all be

169
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:42,952
山姆沃尔顿
Sam Walton.

170
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,635
{\pos(192,26)}沃尔玛的开办人

171
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:46,207
那是我的大业
That's my job.

172
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:50,919
当我的步兵开始谈论像分成
And when my foot soldiers start talking about shit like cuts

173
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:53,006
诸如此类的鬼话题时
and percentages and things like that,

174
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,630
这可是合伙人的谈话
well, see, that's partner talk.

175
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:57,599
我需要的不是合伙人
And I don't need a partner.

176
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:59,301
我要的是装料工 出纳员
I need stockers and cashiers and

177
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,835
雇佣兵 还有苦力们
mercenaries and mules.

178
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,799
想当初 我发现你的时候
And in your case, Padre,

179
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,396
Padre 你只是我在园艺部门碰巧遇到的
dime-bag dealers from the lawn and garden department.

180
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,838
廉价包经营商
Coincidentally, where I found you.

181
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,618
现在呢 Padre 我很喜欢你 真的
Now, Padre, I like you. I really do.

182
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:13,400
我也喜欢你儿子
I like your son too.

183
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,636
我真的很感激你们父子为我做的那些破事
I really appreciate all the shit you've done for me,

184
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:16,282
你懂得
you know,

185
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,434
上帝不想看见的那些事
that God wouldn't be proud of.

186
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:23,553
可是有些事 你还是掐灭苗头
But some things, you just have to stop them before they start.

187
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:25,794
合作可是野心的祸端
See, partnership leads to ambition.

188
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,241
而野心通向的是一个人们鲜少用到的词语了
Ambition leads to a word they don't use much any more.

189
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:32,836
叛乱
Mutiny.

190
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,405
- 爸爸 那是什么   - 是坏消息
- Papa, what's that? - It's bad news.

191
00:12:57,556 --> 00:13:00,719
听好了 笨蛋们 这是Celeste
Listen up, dipshits! This here is Celeste.

192
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:02,266
她要给我们
And she'd like to give us

193
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:04,768
一大笔钱去把她儿子从她那个游手好闲的前夫
an assload of money to kidnap her godkid back

194
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,602
手里拐回来 这样说对吗
from her deadbeat ex-husband. That about cover it?

195
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:09,760
- 我想是吧   - 好吧
- I guess so. - Well, OK.

196
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:12,080
让我先找找这里的失踪人员报导
Let me just find my missing persons report here,

197
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,525
再给你个方案
and I'll get you right set up.

198
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,284
你心思暴露了 老兄
You out your damn mind, brother?

199
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,840
那边的大家伙 是Lincoln
The big fellow over there, that's Lincoln.

200
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,479
说大话的笨蛋是McQueen
The mouthy little faggot here is McQueen.

201
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,209
我是Brick
And I'm Brick.

202
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,966
你跟她提过
Did you happen to mention

203
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,604
绑架不是我们真正的营生吧
that kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

204
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,286
我早上也在那
I was there this morning.

205
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,411
你在教堂?
You was at church?

206
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:38,726
当我看见你们几个把整座屋子都
When I saw you guys take out

207
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:40,724
摆平后毫发无伤地出来时
that whole house and walk out without a scratch,

208
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:42,804
我就知道你们就是我要找的人
I knew I found my guys.

209
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:48,529
狗屁 一定有内幕
Bull sheet. What the catch?

210
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:51,526
是啊 你干嘛不去找警察呢
Yeah. Why didn't you just go to the cops with this?

211
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:57,133
他小时候喉头被毁坏了 不能说话
His voice box was crushed when he was a kid. He can't talk.

212
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:58,967
因为我跟她说过我们能做到
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

213
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:01,603
为什么他要做这么件傻事呢
Why would he go and do a dumb thing like that?

214
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,493
因为你们是我唯一能找到的帮手了
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

215
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,646
我只想要回Rob 带他离开这一切
I just want to get Rob and take him away from all this shit.

216
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,716
周二晚上就没有办法了
That window closes Tuesday night.

217
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,411
我们看起来像联邦快递吗
Do we look like FedEx to you?

218
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,454
- 闭嘴   - 你闭嘴
- Shut up. - You shut up.

219
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,130
- 你才闭嘴   - 你闭嘴
- Shut up, man. - You shut up.

220
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,889
我在跟这位女士说话 闭上你的嘴
I'm talking to the lady. Shut up, man!

221
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:16,126
- 闭嘴!   - 我只想彻底解脱出来
- Shut up! - I just want peace of mind.

222
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:17,935
而警察给不了我
That's something the cops can't give me.

223
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,737
- 你觉得我们可以?   - 是的
- And you think we can provide that? - Yeah.

224
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:25,524
要是他被捕了
If he's arrested,

225
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,366
18个月后他出来然后又找到我
he'll just get out in 18 months and hunt me down.

226
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:29,928
我们又不是Oodie兄弟公司
This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

227
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,981
现在是了
It is now.

228
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:36,129
她给了我们两万五的理由开张
She just gave us 25,000 reasons to open up shop.

229
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,098
预付的五千
Five up front.

230
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:45,650
弟兄们 这就是我们一直在等的
Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

231
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,214
这是个机会
It's a chance.

232
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:50,546
你不是想成为最后一个顾家好男人么
You wanted to be the last true family man,

233
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,373
Clark
Clark.

234
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:54,854
好吧
Ok.

235
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,493
好吧 女士 你的钱我们收下了
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

236
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,405
我们会把你的孩子弄回来
We'll even get your kid back.

237
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,177
但这个男人 这个 呃
But if this man, this, uh...

238
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:06,236
Carlos
Carlos.

239
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,938
要是他像你说的这么疯狂
If he's as crazy as you say he is,

240
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,015
他干嘛不一早就杀了你
then why didn't he just kill you in the first place?

241
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,141
他试过
He tried.

242
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,062
所以你们走的时候
So when you leave,

243
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:20,311
如果Lincoln
it would be great

244
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,903
能爆了他的头那是再好不过了
if Lincoln could put a boot through his skull.

245
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,301
女士们 还有疑问吗
You ladies have any other questions?

246
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:39,626
Henry 有人在后面等你 办公室里
Henry, there's someone in the back for you. In your office.

247
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,276
谁啊
Who?

248
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,063
Anthony Reese 是ATF的探员
Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

249
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:44,005
{\pos(192,26)}烟酒、火器与爆炸物管理局

250
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,005
- 还很可爱   - 多谢
- Cute, too. - Yeah. Thanks for that.

251
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:49,498
我进门之前会整理一番的
I'll be sure to freshen up before I go in.

252
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:08,549
Reese探员
Agent Reese.

253
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,088
我是Henry Millard
Henry Millard.

254
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:13,502
- 荣幸之至 先生   - 好吧
- Pleasure, sir. - Well...

255
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:15,934
我们这儿穿正装的可不多见
We don't see suits in here much.

256
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:17,344
是啊 我想我明白为什么
Yeah, I can see why.

257
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:19,460
人们怎样能生活在这么热的地方
How do people move in this heat?

258
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,868
我们一直如此
At our own pace.

259
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,388
那么...我能帮你什么呢
So... what can I do you for?

260
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,864
我想问几个问题
Well, I wanted to ask you a few questions regarding the shootout

261
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,591
是关于今天早上的枪战
that occurred earlier today.

262
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,903
我们认为可以确定几个嫌疑人
We think we may have a lead on some suspects.

263
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:37,307
- 那是真的?   - 是的 先生 没错
- Is that a fact? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

264
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:42,070
这原来...这是个很有意思的地方
It was a... It's an interesting region you have over here.

265
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:43,384
每隔几个月
It seems every few months

266
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,385
这里都有一大批暴力的罪犯
there's a large number of violent offenders

267
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:49,025
要么失踪 要么被发现死亡 没有任何征兆
that go missing or show up dead, but there's never any leads.

268
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:53,427
案件就...那么了断了 真是离奇呢
Cases just... go away. It's very weird.

269
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,868
我觉得现在为杀人犯谋求正义
Well, I guess around here finding justice for murderers

270
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:59,594
不是当务之急吧
isn't a top priority.

271
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:03,265
也对 你知道 Oodie兄弟吗
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers?

272
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:04,558
我都知道 孩子
I know all, son. But I

273
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,827
但我能看出你准备好要演说一番啊
can see you came prepared for show and tell.

274
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,955
所以...开始吧
So... get with the getting.

275
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:12,915
好吧 头号嫌犯!
All right. Prime suspects!

276
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,978
案子始于他们的父亲
Case dating back to their father,

277
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:18,027
Jonathan Warren Oodie
Jonathan Warren Oodie,

278
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:19,681
或者Johnny Boy Oodie吧
or Johnny Boy Oodie,

279
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,633
大家这样叫他的
as he was called.

280
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:24,028
我猜你会很喜欢他
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

281
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:25,705
显然 在他二十几岁时
Apparently, in his mid-twenties,

282
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:27,509
Johnny Boy加入了3K党
Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

283
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,289
对当时的地方法的执行来说
Made things very colourful

284
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,911
真是添了不少看点
for local law enforcement back in the day.

285
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,949
提前说一句 3K党就要销声匿迹的时候
Flash-forward, KKK just about dumbed themselves out of existence

286
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:36,813
Johnny Boy
and Johnny Boy

287
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,906
在86年3月的一次联邦毒品突击中
went out in a blaze of glory

288
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,994
带着荣誉死亡了
during a federal drug raid in March of '86.

289
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,440
没人知道孩子的母亲是谁
No known mother to speak of,

290
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,471
他们三个的来历成了圣诞奇迹
which makes these three a Christmas miracle.

291
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,950
听起来熟悉么 Sheriff? 没有吗
Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?

292
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,323
没有爷爷奶奶
There were no grandparents

293
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:51,193
或者亲戚可以适合带孩子的
or kin suitable to take the children in,

294
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,796
所以他们被送到寄养者家里了
so they were sent into foster care.

295
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,844
然后 当他们越来越大时
Then, when they became of age,

296
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:58,433
他们成为所有人的麻烦了
they started to become everyone's problem

297
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,348
年龄最大的是Brick
The oldest is Brick.

298
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,595
简直就是他父亲的翻版
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.

299
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,470
似乎天生就无法与麻烦绝缘
Can't seem to stay out of trouble.

300
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,039
而且这小子爱极了他的枪
And boy, does he love his guns.

301
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,714
来他们似乎想试试遵守下法律
Then it looks as though they tried to go legit for a minute.

302
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,728
就把中间那个兄弟
So they put their middle brother,

303
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,922
Lincoln留在了环形拳击场的南方
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.

304
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,042
他最终在拳击场杀了7名男子 你猜怎么着
He ended up killing seven men in the ring. And guess what?

305
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,997
绝对什么都没有了
Absolutely nothing was done about it.

306
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,754
也不是 发起人并没有起诉他
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,

307
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:21,538
说这只是一场意外
saying it was accidental

308
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,555
而他脖子被扭断的那部分是骗人的玩意
and part of his neck-breaking gimmick.

309
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,379
然后这个人渣从此变得更加捉摸不定
And to make this giant fucker even freakier,

310
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:27,843
他不能说话了
he cannot talk.

311
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:30,076
至少上次检查的时候是不能的
Or at least he couldn't last time anybody checked.

312
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,033
那时他正以Dixie Reaper的名号
Wrestled under the name

313
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:33,397
纵横摔跤界
the Dixie Reaper.

314
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:36,240
再有就是McQueen  他几乎是文盲
And then there's McQueen. Practically illiterate.

315
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,159
他在内心深处就是个婴儿 他想他自己的方式
He's the baby of the brood. He was well on his way

316
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:38,721
成为现实中的"特种部队"
to becoming a real-life G.I. Joe.

317
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:40,044
{\pos(192,26)}美国90年代动画，讲述反恐部队和恐怖组织对抗的故事

318
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,675
但是很明显他和权威不能相溶
But he's got a bit of an issue with authority.

319
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,515
真是漂亮的侦查工作 孩子
That's a mighty fine detective job you've done, son.

320
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:48,313
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

321
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:51,888
但是 做起来可没有你说说那么容易
But... it ain't as easy as all that.

322
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:55,424
所以你知道Oodie兄弟么
So you do know the Oodie Brothers?

323
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,484
我说过 我全知道
Like I said, I know all.

324
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,903
我不能把男孩们带过来
I can't just bring them boys

325
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,165
仅仅因为某个费城来的制服男想要我这么做
in 'cause some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

326
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,647
嗯 如果某个从芝加哥来的制服男要求你
Well, you can if some suit

327
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,440
你就会这么做了吧
from Chicago tells you to.

328
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,964
你呆在这里的时间越长 你就越会明白
The longer you stay down here, the more you're going to realise,

329
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,279
我们不喜欢被要求要做什么 孩子
we don't like being told what to do, son.

330
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,725
现在...
Now...

331
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:18,658
... 如果你不介意
...if you'll excuse me,

332
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,884
我还有其他工作要处理
I got other work to attend to.

333
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,366
不 Sheriff  听着 我只是想要些
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking for,

334
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,125
你懂的 一个小小的合作
you know, a little cooperation.

335
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,283
一旦这个事情告一段落 我就不再缠着你了
Once this thing gets wrapped up, I'll get out of your hair.

336
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,091
你为什么就不能让我把心思放在我的小镇呢
Why don't you let me worry about my county?

337
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,931
午夜的时候我们能到Dallas
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

338
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,769
我可以开到开不下去为止
I'll drive us until I can't drive no more.

339
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:58,047
你能想象她就这么走向前
Can you believe she went ahead

340
00:19:58,204 --> 00:19:59,609
然后预付了我5000块么
and paid us five grand up front?

341
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:01,607
我知道 不是么
I know, right?

342
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:04,433
我是说
I mean,

343
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:06,533
你会认为她有一些信任方面的问题 对吧
you'd think she'd have some trust issues, right?

344
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,218
嘿 是他们中的每一个人
But hey, each to their own.

345
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:09,133
他们中的每一个人都有 伙计
Each to their own, man.

346
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,315
他们中的每一个人
Each to their own.

347
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,414
现在 我知道我们有到Austin的地址
Now, I know we've got an address to Austin,

348
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,799
但是难道她不应该给我们
but shouldn't she have given

349
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,650
那个孩子的画像或者别的什么吗
us like a picture of the kid or something?

350
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,491
你以为那里能有几个孩子
How many kids you reckon they got up there?

351
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,649
我的意思是 他们不是在开日托中心
I mean, they ain't running a day-care centre.

352
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,329
- 好的   - 是啊
- OK. - Yeah.

353
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,609
如果我们到那了以后发现Rob是个婴儿呢
What if we get there and Rob's a baby?

354
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:34,533
呃 如果他是婴儿 他们就会留下婴儿的垃圾
Well, if he's a baby, they got baby junk up there.

355
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:35,210
哦 那很有才
Oh, that's smart.

356
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:36,656
我是说 他们不可能
I mean, it's not like they're riding around

357
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:37,650
带着个放在鞋盒子里的婴儿跑了
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing.

358
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:40,108
我是说 拜托
I mean, come on.

359
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:41,624
除了那个 留在
Besides that, the bullet

360
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,461
Celeste肚子上的子弹的痕迹
scars didn't look too fresh

361
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,135
看起来也不太新鲜了
on Celeste's belly.

362
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,780
- 你说的对  你说得对   - 是啊
- You're right. You're right. - Yeah.

363
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:55,918
如果不止一个孩子呢
What if there's more than one kid?

364
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,735
你干嘛问我这么多
Why are you asking me so many

365
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,622
该死的问题 伙计 我们能不谈这个了吗
goddamn questions, man? We just went over this! What?

366
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:01,694
你想知道什么  你到底想知道什么
What do you want to know?! What do you want to know?!

367
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:03,355
我们怎么知道哪个是Rob
How will we know which is Rob?

368
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,140
我会去问哪个是Rob
I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

369
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,326
这个怎么样 我会说
How about that? I'm gonna say,

370
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:07,533
"你知道什么 我不想要Kevin
"You know what, I don't want Kevin!

371
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:08,199
我不想要Michael
I don't want Michael!

372
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:09,501
不 我不想要Stephen"
No, I don't want Stephen!"

373
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:10,432
如果周围有
If there's a bunch of

374
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,179
一堆该死的孩子 我就会说 我想要Rob
fucking kids around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!

375
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,779
怎么样 他妈的 伙计
How about that? Fucking hell, man!

376
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,935
这是一个该死的简单的入侵和掠夺
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

377
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:20,336
谁在我们面前我们就弄死谁 然后带走Rob
We smash whoever's in front of us and we take Rob!

378
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,306
该死的 简单又清晰
Damn! Plain and simple!

379
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,860
什么  抱歉 Lincoln
What? Sorry, Lincoln.

380
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:26,374
我不知道你为什么鬼叫鬼叫的
I don't know why you have to yell...

381
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,699
我的娘娘腔兄弟是不会闭嘴的
Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

382
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,096
我很好奇 你知道的
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

383
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,826
你从哪儿学到这个词的 好奇?
Where'd you learn that word? Inquisitive?

384
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,153
你他妈从哪儿学来的
Where the fuck did you pick that up?

385
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:36,980
就在我的字典里 伙计
It's in my lexicon, man!

386
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,979
- 蠢货 对么   - 它就在我的脑海里
- Jackass. Yeah? - I've got it up here.

387
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,547
你们不了解我的地方可多了
There's a lot you don't know about me.

388
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:41,697
你准备好方便的时间了吗
Are you ready for a potty break?

389
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:43,301
你又读过多少书 操他妈的
How many books you read, motherfucker?

390
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:56,966
我们在哪儿
Where are we?

391
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,540
我们在Crockett
We're in Crockett.

392
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:03,783
Davy Crockett  几点了
Davy Crockett. What time is it?

393
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:05,907
4点了
Four.

394
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:11,826
嘿
Hey.

395
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,384
额... 我猜每个皮纳塔里都有一个小糖果
Hm... I guess there's a little candy in every pinata.

396
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,270
有免费的呦
Got some free shit!

397
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,794
放轻松 Van Damme  嘿
Take it easy, Van Damme! Hey.

398
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:08,783
Hadji在前台说
Hadji at the front desk said

399
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,472
我们离Austin只有几个小时的距离
we're only a few hours from Austin.

400
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:13,027
很好
Nice!

401
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:20,873
- 谁   - 该死  你觉得还有谁
- Who that? - Fuck. Who do you think?

402
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:23,394
别接电话 伙计
Don't answer that shit, man!

403
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:26,631
别接 你怎么...
Don't answer it. Don't you...

404
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:28,756
- 嘿   - 嘿?
- Hey. - Hey?

405
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,037
别跟我打招呼  你在哪里
Don't hey me. The hell are you?

406
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:33,554
德克萨斯
Texas.

407
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,438
德克萨斯?
Texas?

408
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:36,390
你他妈怎么
Well, what in the Sam

409
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,069
会在德克萨斯呢
Hill could you possibly have to do in Texas?

410

就在这途中
It's on the way!

414
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,475
我有份工作要到这儿
I took a job out here.

415
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,679
哦 你找到工作了 好吧 原谅我
Oh, you took a job! Well, excuse me.

416
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,604
我之前在想什么 我忘了
What was I thinking? I forgot

417
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:51,378

Oh, you're going to handle it like you handled me yesterday?

423
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:00,895
你们没能检查一次
It's bad enough

424
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,312
那个该死的地址已经够糟的了
you can't check a damn address,

425
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:04,679
你们居然还把那些猪肉搁在我的后院里?
but you also got to lay them pork chops out in my backyard?

426
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,436
- 计在我们的账上好了   - 那是什么

这不是开玩笑

429
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:12,636
这个小过失对我来说将会很痛苦
This little misstep is gonna be a pain for me,

430
00:24:12,793 --> 00:24:13,580
但是对你来说

431
00:24:13,748 --> 00:24:14,716
你可能已经他妈的捅了马蜂窝了

432
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:16,399
你在说什么 你什么意思
What are you talking about? What do you mean?

433
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,397
有一个ATF的探员找上我了
I've got some jackleg ATF agent up my ass,

434
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:20,556
指望找个罪名把你们关起来
looking to make a name for locking up you idiots.

435
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:21,941
我最不希望看到的就是
The last thing I need is for

436
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:24,002
你们这群白痴又在引起不必要的注意
you dumb shits to draw more unneeded attention.

437
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:25,702
我认真的 Brick 我最好
I mean it, Brick. I better

438
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:28,205
不要听到你在德克萨斯那个白痴工作的事
not hear shit about your little Texas job.

439
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:29,595
保持你的屁股不要触电
Keep your ass off the grid.

440
00:24:29,755 --> 00:24:31,644
不要打我家里的电话  把这个号码记下来
Don't call my house. Write this number down.

441
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:35,403
而且看在上帝的份上 丢掉那该死的手机
And for the love of God, get rid of that damn cell phone.

442
00:24:37,236 --> 00:24:39,967

You mess around and fuck up my pension, that's your ass.

444
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,767

Man! Don't take it out on me because you got your ass chewed.

453
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,526
我们有活干了 男孩子们
We got work to do, boys.

454

就没有人知道如何使用策略了么
Doesn't anybody know how to use finesse any more?

475
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:50,212
你还好么
You all right?

476
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,746
头盔他妈的不太适合
The helmet ain't work for shit.

477

My bad, lady. You OK?

482
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:36,506
为我辩护下 这都是因为你为一个混蛋工作
In my defence, you do work for an asshole.

483

It looks like a fucking bomb went off.

492
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:41,671
Denny?

493
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:44,873

OK, Marty, I know it's over a year ago,

501
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,305
但是我需要你想想 好吗

502
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:13,979
你确实杀了Celeste 对不对
You did kill Celeste, right?

503
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:15,714
你不会骗我吧 你会吗
You wouldn't lie to me about that shit, would you?

504
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,171
我把三颗子弹射入了她的内脏
I put three bullets in her gut.

505
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,997
她看起来死了
She looked dead to me.

506
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,674
但是你没检查她是否真的死了 你没有吧
But you didn't check to see if she was dead, did you?

507
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:24,360
应该是没有
Guess not.

508
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:27,513
那可是我们的金票啊 我操你妈
That was our golden ticket, you stinking fuck!

509
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:30,400

How am I going to pay for this? You got the dough?

510

You got a fucking piggy bank in your fat ass?

511
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,441

512
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,186

OK. As long as you're sorry,

513
00:29:40,187 --> 00:29:41,921
我想这才是重要的 不是吗
I guess that's all that matters, isn't it?

514
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,996

你还想去看看那辆车吗
You still want to go look at that car?

519
00:30:08,714 --> 00:30:10,637
那个Carlos让你变残废了?
That Carlos man make you cripple?

520
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:15,839
嗨 伙计
Hi, buddy.

521
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:18,325
我不认为他能说话
I don't think he can talk.

522
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:22,685
- 嗯 不会这么惨吧 伙计   - 什么
- Well, ain't this some shit, man. - What?

523

That he's all, you know...

524
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:28,559
- 别那么做   - 什么
- Don't do that shit! - What?

525
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:31,037
因为你太刻薄了 他不会受得了的
'Cause you're being mean! He can't help it.

526
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,004
你还好吧
You OK?

527
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:36,401
你受伤了吗
You hurt?

528
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:39,757
你没事吧  他能听的懂我们
You OK? He can understand us.

529
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:43,240
你是怎么明白他的意思是"我很好"的?
How the hell did you get "I'm OK" From that?

530
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:47,629
嘿 听着 伙计  我们不会伤害你
Hey, look, buddy. We ain't going to hurt you,

531
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,208
好么 Celeste让我们来的
all right? Celeste sent us.

532
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:52,288
你知道Celeste吗
You know Celeste?

533
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,282
是啊 他动了 看到没 他听得懂我们的
Yeah! There he goes! See? He understands us just fine.

534
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,762
再说一次 你怎么知道他的意思是什么
Once again, how the hell do you know what he's saying?

535
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,365
你是温情大姐姐吗
You the tard whisperer?

536
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,806
你再说一遍 我就杀了你
You say that again, I'm gonna kill you.

537
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,043
我没在戏弄他 我就是说说
I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.

538
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,042
再说一遍 你就是在戏弄他
Say it again. You are making fun.

539
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,726
我真没在戏弄他 我只是说说的
I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.

540
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:09,852
你就在戏弄他
You are making fun of him.

541
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,016
只是有点奇怪
It's just a little weird

542
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:13,005
她没有提到这个可怜的小伙子
that she didn't mention the poor little fella's

543
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:14,287
已经残废了 你知道么
all buggered up, you know?

544
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:15,289
它不重要
It don't matter.

545
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:16,315
她让我们来带走Rob
She sent us to get Rob.

546
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:17,143
我们已经带走Rob了
We got Rob.

547
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:18,604
好吗
All right?

548
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:20,793
伙计 你还好吧
You good, buddy?

549
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:25,494
我不是在说风凉话
I wasn't being mean.

550
00:31:25,495 --> 00:31:26,088
你就是在说风凉话
You were being mean!

551
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,927
你把他当做笑柄
You were making fun of him.

552
00:31:29,243 --> 00:31:33,134
上帝保佑  他没法控制这些
Bless his heart. He ain't got no control over that.

553
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:39,969
他不在客厅里真他妈太好了
It's a damn good thing he wasn't in the living room.

554
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,566
我只是随便说说
I'm just saying.

555
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:51,775
嗯 我们可以那么做
Yeah, we can do that.

556
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,416
哦 我们能做到的
Oh, we can get that done.

557
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:02,357
好的 Carlos
All right, Carlos.

558
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:06,016
我只是还要完成一点小事
I'm just finishing up a little something here.

559
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:08,118
然后我们就上路
Then we'll get on the road.

560
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,533
你难道不担心么 甜心
Don't you worry about a thing, sweetie.

561
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,893
抱歉 议员
Excuse me, councilman.

562
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:39,452
什么 他想要洗澡
What? He wanted a bath.

563
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:48,096
另一个准备好了么? 我都没脱光呢
Another one already? I didn't even get off.

564
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:48,787
为了Carlos
It's for Carlos.

565
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,052
嗯 这就好多了
Well, that makes it a bit better.

566
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,100
不会有比这感觉更好的了 Bill
Doesn't get much better than this, Bill.

567
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,695
要是鱼能像这些恙螨一样
It'd be better than this if

568
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:27,147
赶紧咬钩的话就好了
the fish was biting as well as these chiggers.

569
00:33:31,937 --> 00:33:33,939
你要害到我了
You gotta be shitting me.

570
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,338
这就是真正的警察事要处理的事情吗
This is where the real police matters are handled, huh?

571
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:37,959
哦 你是说动用私人财产?
Oh, you mean on private property?

572
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:39,581
是啊 有些时候是要
Yeah, sometimes it is.

573
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:41,786
我是Anthony Reese 是ATF特工
Anthony Reese, ATF.

574
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,424
Bill Hawkins 很高兴见到你
Bill Hawkins. Nice to meet you.

575
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:45,226
Bill是一名州议员
Bill's a representative for the state.

576
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:47,143
啊 很高兴见到你 先生
Ah, nice to meet you, sir.

577
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:49,089
Bill 你听说过
Bill, have you heard about

578
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:50,866
在我们这里有个正在进行的调查吗
an investigation going on in our area?

579
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:51,631
不 我没有听说过
No, I haven't.

580
00:33:52,273 --> 00:33:52,968
看来Reese探员
It seems Agent Reese

581
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:55,270
是上面派来检查我们的工作的
was sent down here to check up on us.

582
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,024
鉴于他是常青藤盟校毕业的
Seeing as he's an Ivy League grad,

583
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,182
我想 这让他比我们更胜任这份工作
I guess that makes him better at our jobs than we are.

584
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,387
哦 是吗
Oh, is he now?

585
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,638
别这么说 我无意插手你们的工作
No. I'm not trying to intrude,

586
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,432
只是想从旁协助
only assist.

587
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:07,869
警长 我觉得我们一开始就把关系搞砸了
Sheriff, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

588
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:10,547
我们是一个阵营的 我不想让你觉得
We're on the same team. I don't want it to feel like

589
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,750
我侵犯你的地盘 我只是...
I'm infringing on your territory. I just...

590
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:14,552
我真的觉得那三兄弟跟案情有关
I really think we have something with these Oodies.

591
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:16,909
我们钓鱼的时候不谈工作的事儿 伙计
We don't talk business when I'm fishing, son.

592
00:34:17,062 --> 00:34:19,269
我要抛鱼钩啦 当心鱼钩
When I'm about to cast. Don't get hooked!

593
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:22,522
当然
We can, however,

594
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:26,072
明天在我办公室 我们可以谈论所有事情
talk all about it tomorrow at my office.

595
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:28,836
看到你们北方佬来到这儿 仗着当局的权威
It don't excite me that some Yankee's come down here

596
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:29,798
在我好朋友面前作威作福
imposing his authority

597
00:34:29,955 --> 00:34:31,426
可让我高兴不起来啊
on one of my best friends.

598
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:33,622
上次我查的时候
This county has the lowest

599
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:35,627
整个州我们这个县的犯罪率是最低的
crime rate in the state, last time I checked.

600
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,115
- 就是   - 我知道你们民主党
- Uh-huh. - I know you Democrats

601
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:38,629
认为我们需要你们的帮助
think we need your help,

602
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,969
但你听好了 我们不需要
but I'm here to tell you that we don't.

603
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,154
要在哥伦比亚特区跟你对抗 我可真够倒霉
Bad enough I've gotta fight you in D.C.

604
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:44,792
现在你可以
Now you can just ease your

605
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:47,196
像你进来那样 从这儿出去
way out of here the same way you eased in.

606
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:50,236
好让我享受剩下的午后时光
I'd like to enjoy what's left of my afternoon.

607
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:55,909
那...好吧
Alrighty, then.

608
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,868
你为什么不回家 去你老婆身边待着呢
Why don't you go back home to that wife of yours?

609
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:04,554
她一个人抚养孩子多辛苦啊
It must be hard raising a baby all by herself.

610
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:51,757
你的俱乐部真不错
Pretty classy joint you've got here

611
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,638
谢谢 你的衬衫不错
Thanks. Nice shirt.

612
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,964
- 你就是Lucky   - 是的
- You Lucky? - That's right.

613
00:36:03,114 --> 00:36:05,037
我们看看那个
Let's see about that.

614
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:07,323
嘿 家伙 帮我把后面那该死的关掉好吗
Hey, man, why don't you turn that shit off back there for me?

615
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:08,112
那是Mac
That's Mac.

616
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:09,647
他98岁高龄
He's 98 years old.

617
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:10,763
我觉得他有权利看一些色情的东西
I think he's earned the right

618
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:13,043
如果他想的话
to watch a little T and A if he wants.

619
00:36:13,195 --> 00:36:15,483
是吗 可他一动不动的
Why? He ain't jerking nothing.

620
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:16,338
呃 是这样 但是自从
Yeah, well, he's been

621
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:16,873
我开创这家俱乐部以来
watching that stuff

622
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:17,843
他就一直在看那些玩意儿
since I opened the joint,

623
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:20,727
所以我就让他看咯 这没问题吧
so I'm gonna keep it that way, all right?

624
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:22,765
哦 那这样吧
Well, how about this?

625
00:36:22,916 --> 00:36:24,570
我过去那儿
If I go back there, I'm

626
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,878
我就弄死Mac 打碎你的电视 怎样
gonna bust up Mac and your TV. How about that?

627
00:36:28,037 --> 00:36:29,585
呃 你不是开玩笑的吧
Yeah, is that a fact?

628
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:35,274
怎么回事儿
What the fuck?

629
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:37,444
看到了吗 我这儿有个未成年呢
See, I got a minor with me.

630
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:40,761
我可不希望他听到那些东西
I'd appreciate it if he wouldn't have to listen to that.

631
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,209
嘿 Mac 我要把电视关了 好吧
Hey, Mac, I'm gonna give it a rest for a second, all right?

632
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,929
我来找一个朋友 Terry
I'm looking for a friend of mine. Terry.

633
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,047
Macky
Macky?

634
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
我要关了电视
I'm gonna give it a rest!

635
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,886

00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:06,205
说话啊 Mac Mac
Say, Mac. Mac?

637
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:09,690
看来Mac终于看够了
It looks like Mac finally had enough.

638
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:11,890
嘿 伙计
Hey, man.

639
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:18,365
让我猜猜 这就是你说你会回来的部分
Let me guess. This is the part where you say

640
00:37:18,523 --> 00:37:21,606
我说的对吗
you'll be back. Am I right?

641
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:25,164
我会回来的
I'll be back.

642
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:31,447
你看过这个电影吗
You know this movie?

643
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,806
我会回来的
I'll be back.

644
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:54,051
我会回来的
I'll be back.

645
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:01,419
哦 你是不是觉得很神奇啊
Well, ain't you full of surprises?

646
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,074
嘿 我是Lucky 嗯
Hey, this is Lucky. Yeah,

647
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:26,535
听着 帮我叫辆救护车过来 好吗
listen, I need an ambulance down here, OK?

648
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,297
Mac好像过世了 好吧
It seems like Mac's passed on, OK?

649
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:36,461
你这儿除了酒吧小吃 没有别的吃的了吗
You got anything to eat back there besides the bar food bullshit?

650
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:37,254
我得去拿
I have to go get it.

651
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,697
好的 搞点好吃的 伙计
Well, rustle something up, man.

652
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:41,863
给这孩子弄点东西吃
I need something for the kid,

653
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,503

654
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:45,496

还不知道想喝什么呢
Don't know what we'd like yet.

658
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:19,581
没问题 想到了就告诉我们

665
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:03,309
她叫Jez 你可以给我们买杯饮料吗
Her name is Jez. And you can buy us a drink.

666
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:05,779

I'll be right back.

670
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:20,425
自己想办法
Figure it out.

671
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:28,145
说说你的故事 我会假装在认真听的
What's your story? And I'm gonna pretend I'm listening.

672
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:30,387
狗娘养的 说什么不想让那孩子看色情片
Damn bullshit! Don't want the kid seeing porn,

673
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:32,189
但是那些小妖精一进来
but when some sweet tail walks in,

674
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,833
他们却忘得一干二净了 不是吗
they forget all about that, right?

675
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:36,907
四年来头一次有几个长相甜美
First time in four years I got some sweet,

676

687
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,239
那是个骗子还是同性恋的名字?
Is that the Big Whopper or the Ponytail?

688
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:25,712
对了 Marty跟你问好
By the way, Marty says hi.

689
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,532

Yeah? Well, tell Marty, "Fuck you.

690
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:29,193
我看你怎么躲过下一颗子弹
" I see you dodged another bullet.

691
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:30,682
你怎么知道我电话号码的
How'd you get this number?

692
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:34,234
宝贝 现在我想要的东西 就没有得不到的
These days, baby, I can get just about anything I want to.

693
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:38,238
比如 现在我要开车去拿回我的钱
For instance, right now I'm getting back my paycheque on wheels

694
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:39,499
从你派出的那堆业余人员手里
from those amateurs you sent.

695
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:41,296
你个爱财如命的混蛋
Moneygrubbing piece of shit!

696
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:43,546
我们怎么了 宝贝
What happened to us, baby?

697
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:44,760
我们之前很甜蜜 不是吗
We were good once, weren't we?

698
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:47,277
去你的 我们从来没有甜蜜过
Fuck you! We were never good.

699
00:41:47,278 --> 00:41:48,122
我被你耍了
I got played and that's that.

700
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:49,464
喔 等等
Whoa. Hang on a second.

701
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,802
要是真有谁被耍了 那个人是我
Anybody got played, it was me.

702
00:41:52,954 --> 00:41:55,798
被你这个婊子耍了
I thought I had a bitch that was down with this shit.

703
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:57,844
你杀了他父母 你个神经病
You killed his parents, you psycho!

704
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:00,396
还是我带你介入他们的生活的 想想就恶心
And it makes me sick that I brought you into their world!

705
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:02,683
你不觉得是因为他们看人的眼光太差么
Don't you think they're just a bad judge of character?

706
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:04,758
这又不是我的错 谁让你的朋友太有钱了
It ain't my fault all your friends are richer than shit.

707
00:42:04,915 --> 00:42:06,401
难道你一点也不知道么
And you know something?

708
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:08,159
想来想去 我觉得你是知道的
At the end of the day, I think you knew.

709
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:09,305
如果我知道 我会
If I knew, I would have

710
00:42:09,306 --> 00:42:11,240
在你睡觉的时候烧死你这个窝囊废
lit your gutless ass on fire while you slept!

711
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:14,286
现在的你 才是我认识的那个易怒的婊子
Now, there's the feisty bitch I know!

712
00:42:14,436 --> 00:42:17,168
我真心希望事情的结果不是这样
I wish it hadn't ended up the way it did.

713
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:18,194
但是Clyde会怎么做呢
But what's Clyde gonna do

714
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,048
如果Bonnie发起狂来惹他生气
if Bonnie crosses him and goes soft?

715
00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:24,879
再说了 那个狗娘养的要钱干嘛
And besides, what does that son of a bitch need money for?

716
00:42:25,038 --> 00:42:26,395
我是说 一个轮椅能要多少钱
I mean, how much can a wheelchair cost?

717
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:27,405
两三百美元吗
Two or three hundred dollars?

718
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:28,976
你个没良心的混账东西
You lost, motherfucker!

719
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:30,395
我会把Rob带回来的
Rob's coming back with me.

720
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:31,040
你看着办吧
Deal with it.

721
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:33,595
哦 小妞
Now, girlie,

722
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:36,603
看来你经历一次之后还没学乖
obviously you didn't learn the first time around.

723
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:39,080
我来告诉你这事儿会怎么结束
Let me tell you how this shit's gonna end.

724
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,888
我派了一些可怕的女人去解决这件事
I sent some really awful bitches to handle this situation.

725
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,973
现在 一旦她们找到你的同伙
Now, once they track down your fellas,

726
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:46,690
不会是一场血腥屠杀
it's not gonna be a bloodbath.

727
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,971
而是一场性感表演
It's gonna get fucking sexy.

728
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:57,602
把他们一个个 分散开来
They'll single them out, divide them up, then thin the herd.

729
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:43,170
每个人都会忘乎所以
Each one will have forgotten about everything,

730
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:45,933
只能看到眼前挑逗他们的陌生女郎
except for the fine piece of strange grinding on them.

731
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:07,773
然后 毫无预兆 他们就死翘翘了
Then, without warning, their lives will be snuffed out

732
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:09,769
最后那些女人会把Rob送过来
and the girls deliver Rob just

733
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,652
我刚好能为他的18岁生日做好准备
in time for me to plan the boy's 18th birthday.

734
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,653
你本应该老老实实待着的 亲爱的
You should have stayed dead, darling.

735
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,785
因为 除非你的名字是耶稣
'Cause unless your name is Jesus,

736
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:18,702
否则根本没必要重返人世
you had no business coming back.

737
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:20,660
回见
See you soon.

738
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:04,142
怎么不试试我的厉害
Why don't you try a taste of me?

739
00:45:23,218 --> 00:45:23,846
哦 你们好啊 大家伙

五个如花似玉的美人儿来到这儿
Five girls like that come in there,

751
00:46:58,617 --> 00:46:59,876

那些猫咪们可不是免费的

00:50:09,811 --> 00:50:11,285
那么 我建议你最好阻止他们
Well, I suggest you better stop them.

820
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:12,382
我可以打电话给Walters长官问问情况
I could call Chief Walters,

821
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:13,595
不过我很确信
but I'm pretty sure ain't

822
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:15,341
那儿只剩下烟和灰尘了
nothing left out there but smoke and ash.

823
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:18,894
哦 我感到很抱歉
My! I'm really sorry about that.

824
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:21,578
刚刚听起来好像真有什么事儿呢
It really sounded like you had something there.

825
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:29,093
混蛋 我受够了你这样浪费我的时间
Motherfucker, I'm done with you wasting my time.

826
00:50:29,253 --> 00:50:31,779
这可是你自找的
I don't ever remember asking for it.

827
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:34,015
你现在在做的这些 扮演老好人
This good-old-boy justice thing you got going on,

828
00:50:34,173 --> 00:50:37,144
让垃圾去处理垃圾
letting the trash take out the trash, saving tax dollars

829
00:50:37,294 --> 00:50:39,615
把生活在最底层的人排除在体制外来节省税收
by keeping the bottomfeeders out of the system

830
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:42,903
好让自己能够整天去钓鱼
so you can just go fishing all day,

831
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:45,057
要知道你是在玩火
that's a slippery slope you're playing on.

832
00:50:45,215 --> 00:50:46,038
现在
It's gotten to the point

833
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:47,616
你不比那些垃圾好到哪儿去 警长
where you're no better than they are, Sheriff.

834
00:50:49,055 --> 00:50:51,456
没错 我要是你 我就会格外当心
Yeah, I'd be careful if I was you.

835
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:57,063
哦 我会慎重考虑你的意见的
Well, I'll take that under advisement.

836
00:51:02,377 --> 00:51:04,300
放屁
Shit.

837
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,502
起来
Wake up.

838
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,174
去给Rob弄些吃的
Go get Rob something to eat.

839
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,143
我去打电话给Celeste
I'm gonna call Celeste.

840
00:51:55,943 --> 00:51:59,265
噢 找到一顶好帽子 伙计
Ooh... Found the mother lode, boy!

841
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:12,112
我会付钱的 别担心 真是的
I'm gonna pay for it. Don't worry. God.

842
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:22,396
要知道 伙计 当你在商店打开某样东西
You see, man, when you open up something in the store...

843
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:26,267
你就得付钱
...you have to pay for it.

844
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:34,469
我小的时候没人告诉我
No one taught me that when I was young.

845
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,554
我历经艰难才懂得这个道理
I learnt that one the hard way.

846
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,631
从警察那里
From the cops.

847
00:52:44,668 --> 00:52:46,239
怎么了
What?

848
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,235
怎么了 伙计
What's wrong, man?

849
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:54,600
你只是那样扭动 我不知道啥意思
I don't know you mean by all that squirming.

850
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:58,311
帮帮我 伙计 你要什么 嗯 要什么
Help me out, bud. What you need, huh? What you need?

851
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,794
你要小便吗
You got to take a piss?

852
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:06,637
你饿啦 天 你当然是饿了
You're hungry. Goddamn, of course you're hungry!

853
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:11,752
给你弄点吃的吧 好的 我们走
Let's get you something to eat, eh? OK. Let's go.

854
00:53:11,911 --> 00:53:13,755
天哪
Man!

855
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:18,003
每次和这小男孩说话都像在猜谜
It's like working out a riddle every time talking to this boy.

856
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:20,280
早上好 美女 那啥
Morning, sunshine! You know,

857
00:53:20,432 --> 00:53:21,552
我不记得我们的交易里面
I don't remember crazy-ass

858
00:53:21,553 --> 00:53:23,277
还包括了那些疯狂的小妖精
biker chicks being involved in our deal.

859
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,613
我也不记得我们的交易里
I don't remember leaving

860
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:27,074
要让Carlos活着 Rob没事吧
Carlos alive in the deal either. Is Rob all right?

861
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:28,962
操
Fuck!

862
00:53:30,394 --> 00:53:32,283
嗯 他可能被吓得半死 不过他很好
Yeah, he's probably scared half to death, but he's fine.

863
00:53:32,434 --> 00:53:33,604
让我跟他谈谈
Let me talk to him.

864
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:34,562
他在里面吃东西
He's inside getting something to eat

865
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:36,364
跟McQueen一起 另外 我们得谈谈
with McQueen. Besides, you and I got something to talk about.

866
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:38,164
好吧 昨晚究竟是怎么回事
All right? What the hell was that last night?

867
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:39,549
我跟你说过了 Carlos会
I told you, Carlos would

868
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,814
想尽办法把Rob弄回去
try to get Rob back

869
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:41,762
如果你不杀了他的话
if you didn't kill him.

870
00:53:41,915 --> 00:53:42,889
你到底在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

871
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,441
我们杀了那里的所有混蛋
We killed every motherfucker in that place.

872
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:47,075
很明显你没有 Brick
Well, evidently not, Brick!

873
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:49,318
好吧 像Carlos那样的家伙
All right. Why would a guy like Carlos, what would he want to do

874
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,797
对Rob那种情况的孩子会有什么企图
with a kid in Rob's condition?

875
00:53:51,956 --> 00:53:52,789
Carlos杀了Rob的父母
Carlos killed Rob's parents,

876
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:54,997
而且还瞒着我
and then lied to me about it.

877
00:53:56,557 --> 00:53:59,037
这些事难道不该早点告诉我么
That might have been something you wanted to mention.

878
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:00,961
好吧 听着 我很抱歉
All right, look. I'm sorry.

879
00:54:02,077 --> 00:54:05,048
Rob满18岁的时候会有一笔信托基金
Rob has a trust that matures when he's 18,

880
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:06,800
和他一起
and as legal guardians,

881
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,726
被托付给法定监护人
we would get him and eventually the money.

882
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:13,964
你早就该告诉我这些了 操
That too might be something that you wanted to mention! Fuck!

883
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:16,465
Rob的信托基金下周就可以兑现了
Rob's trust matures next week and...

884
00:54:16,466 --> 00:54:18,681
Carlos会不择手段的
Carlos will do anything to get it.

885
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,026
Brick 他现在只有你了
Brick, you're all he's got.

886
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:22,241
好吧  新的方案
All right. New plan.

887
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:24,933
你在半路跟我们碰头
You meet us halfway.

888
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:26,200
好吧 在哪
Fine. Where?

889
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,966
密西西比州维克斯堡的大河口野营地
Vicksburg, Mississippi. Big Bayou Campground.

890
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:33,523
我会尽快到的
I'll be there as soon as I can.

891
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:35,429
还有如果你敢再骗我
And if you lie to me again,

892
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,084
Carlos会是你这辈子担心的最后一件事
Carlos will be the least of your worries.

893
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:39,831
我已经杀了五个婊子
I already dropped five bitches.

894
00:54:39,832 --> 00:54:41,132
杀第六个眼都不用眨
I won't hesitate to make it six.

895
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:53,014
你可能听过小热狗卷
Now, you may have heard of pig in a blanket,

896
00:54:53,163 --> 00:54:55,530
但这货是烤小热狗
but this here is a pig in the sun.

897
00:55:00,204 --> 00:55:02,507
你想要把头发搭在胸脯上吗
You want hair on your chest, now, don't you?

898
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,925
脱衣舞女喜欢这样
Strippers like it.

899
00:55:05,524 --> 00:55:06,890
把餐纸递给我 哥们儿
Hand me a napkin, man.

900
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:17,206
你还好吗
You all right?

901
00:55:17,886 --> 00:55:20,173
别担心
Hey. Don't worry.

902
00:55:20,326 --> 00:55:21,858
别担心 哥们儿
Don't worry, man.

903
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:24,412
没有什么能伤害Lincoln的
Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

904
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:26,137
他很好
He's OK.

905
00:55:27,607 --> 00:55:29,416
...确认与乡下的德克萨斯酒吧
...believed to be responsible for the shooting

906
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:30,728
枪击案有关
in a rural Texas bar.

907
00:55:30,887 --> 00:55:33,459
他们带着一位残障少年 并确定携带武器
They are travelling with a disabled young man and believed to be

908
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:37,852
且非常危险  如果您发现他们千万不要靠近
armed and dangerous. Do not approach these men if you see them.

909
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:49,057
有人想要一颗窃笑炸弹吗
Who wants a Snicker bomb, huh?

910
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,094
你以为你能用它拐骗小孩离开这吗
Think you can kidnap some kid and get away with it?

911
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:01,340
好吧 你要是会数数的话 五个杀手婊子
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math, five whore assassins

912
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,892
还不如三个傻子和一个瘸子吧
can't trump three retards and a fucking cripple.

913
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:06,531
我是说 照我的估计
I mean, well, according to my calculations,

914
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:08,694
他们现在应该已经到你的地盘上了
they should be in your area someplace by now.

915
00:56:08,852 --> 00:56:10,934
但这是你们的该干的活 不是吗
But that's not my fucking job to figure out, is it?

916
00:56:11,092 --> 00:56:13,982
拦路抢劫不是你们老本行吗
I mean, isn't owning the road your goddamn job?

917
00:56:14,132 --> 00:56:16,180
我就是这么想的  好吧
That's what I thought. OK.

918
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:17,395
我不管你怎么做
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do.

919
00:56:17,396 --> 00:56:18,813
把那小子带回来给我就对了
Just get my boy back.

920
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:20,904
对 搞定它
Yes! Get it done!

921
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,456
- 喂   - 我们搞得一团糟
- Yeah? - We're in a world of shit down here.

922
00:56:30,614 --> 00:56:32,264
嗯 然后现在要连我牵扯进来么
Yeah, and now it's spilling over into mine.

923
00:56:32,414 --> 00:56:33,779
听着 我们准备去密西西比州的维克斯堡
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg, Mississippi.

924
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:34,453
行吗
OK?

925
00:56:35,175 --> 00:56:36,674
大河口野营地  我们准备
Big Bayou Campground. We could...

926
00:56:36,675 --> 00:56:38,707
停 停 闭嘴
Stop. Stop! Shut up!

927
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:41,260
快他妈闭嘴  我知道的越少越好
Just shut the fuck up! The less I know, the better.

928
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:42,134
我教过你更聪明的办法吧
I taught you better than this!

929
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,060
我只是想
Look, I just thought that if,

930
00:56:44,505 --> 00:56:46,499
你知道 如果我们可以跑进去 然后很快搞定
you know, we could run in and do a quick...

931
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,014
别  别想那些有的没有的
Don't do that! Don't get ideas!

932
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,385
只要照老子说的做就好
Just do what the fuck I say!

933
00:56:51,536 --> 00:56:53,699
照我说的做 事情就一帆风顺 不是吗
Things ran smooth when we did that, didn't it?

934
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,505
我帮你擦屁股 你也得照看好我的
I cleaned up your shit, you took care of mine.

935
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:58,659
我本来能很快搞定这个
I could have handled this hotshot.

936
00:56:58,817 --> 00:57:01,298
但现在却曝光了
But now this shit has gone public.

937
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:04,109
这得怪你们自己瞎干
There's repercussions to working for yourself.

938
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:06,337
现在你学到教训了吧
About time you learned that.

939
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:07,228
什么意思
Meaning what?

940
00:57:07,378 --> 00:57:11,145
我可不管了 Brick  我得明哲保身
I got to cut ties, Brick. I cleaned up everything on my end

941
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:14,143
所以 从现在起你得靠自己了
So, what you do from now on rests solely on your shoulders.

942
00:57:14,299 --> 00:57:18,146
如果你敢回来 我就不得不摆平你们了
If you come back here, I got no choice but to put you down.

943
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,825
我得保护我的家人
I got a family to protect.

944
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,344
我会确保告诉小伙子们我们又自由了
I'll be sure to let the boys know that we're on our own again.

945
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:30,424
再说吧 Sheriff
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

946
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:39,591
Brick  我们得走了
Brick! We gots to go!

947
00:57:39,742 --> 00:57:41,631
我们要红了
We made the news!

948
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:55,348
Hood海盗们  走着
Hood Pirates! Mount up!

949
00:58:18,946 --> 00:58:20,517
把这个给我
Give me that!

950
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:24,599
- 你给Millard打电话吗  - 嗯
- You call Millard?   - Yeah.

951
00:58:26,747 --> 00:58:27,987
他怎么说
Well, what did he say?

952
00:58:28,148 --> 00:58:29,752
现确定犯罪嫌疑人是
The suspects in question are believed to be

953
00:58:29,908 --> 00:58:32,543
Brick Oodie和他的两兄弟
Brick Oodie and his two brothers...

954
00:58:32,544 --> 00:58:33,117
没什么
Nothing.

955
00:58:33,268 --> 00:58:36,431
他们来自亚拉巴马州蒙哥马利的阿特摩地区
They hail from the Atmore area, located in Montgomery, Alabama.

956
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:39,513
他们把你画得像个傻逼  瞧
They drew you to look like a fag. Look at that.

957
00:58:39,669 --> 00:58:42,513
你他妈吃错药了吗 老兄
What the fuck you do that for, man?

958
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,496
操 你干嘛啊 老兄
What the fuck, man?

959
00:58:50,497 --> 00:58:51,311
来啊  来啊
Come on! Come on, huh?

960
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:52,471
- 你是要怎样   - 来啊
- What are you do...? - Come on!

961
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,234
我才不会揍你呢 你这个废柴
I ain't gonna fucking hurt you, you little faggot!

962
00:58:54,391 --> 00:58:56,792
- 住手 老兄   - 来啊 来这儿啊
- Stop, man! - Come on! Come here!

963
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:58,316
想怎样  你想怎样
Want some? You want some?

964
00:58:58,471 --> 00:59:01,714
- 操   - 你吃错药了啊
- Fuck! - What the devil got into you?

965
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,601
我害死我们了
I fucked us.

966
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:10,792
你什么意思
How you mean?

967
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:12,352
呃 我说
Uh, let's see.

968
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:15,641
Millard不会再罩我们了
Millard won't have anything to do with us any more

969
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:16,629
因为他没法摆平
'cause he can't clean up

970
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:18,471
摩托女在酒吧大干后造成的后果
that mess with the biker chicks down at the bar.

971
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,592
所以现在我们不能回亚拉巴马了
So now we can't go back to 'Bama.

972
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,935
还有我们在奥斯丁撂倒的那些狗娘养的
And all of them son of bitches we mowed down in Austin?

973
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:25,524
猜猜看我们忘了哪一个
Guess what we missed.

974
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:26,669
Carlos
Carlos.

975
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:31,433
而且他也不会罢休的
And he ain't gonna stop neither.

976
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,004
他早就开始追着Celeste了
He's already tracked down Celeste.

977
00:59:33,155 --> 00:59:34,550
所以现在我们得带他
So now we gotta get him

978
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:37,160
直到该死的维克斯堡 这样他们就能消失了
to fucking Vicksburg so they can disappear.

979
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:39,920
好吧
Well...

980
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,522
船到桥头自然直
This is getting better by the minute.

981
00:59:45,476 --> 00:59:49,448
我喜欢那个小家伙 就像其他人一样
Now, I like that little fella just as much as anybody.

982
00:59:51,397 --> 00:59:53,283
但跟我说说吧
But tell me something. Just

983
00:59:53,284 --> 00:59:56,848
给我个理由为什么我们为什么不能抛下他不管
give me one reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

984
00:59:59,158 --> 01:00:00,762
他们没得选择
They ain't got no other options.

985
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:03,000
切 我们也没得选择好吧
Hell, we ain't got no other options either.

986
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:06,165
我的意思是 你瞧我们
I mean, look at us.

987
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:08,446
我们甚至不能照顾好自己
We can't even take care of ourselves.

988
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:11,046
你有没有想过
Has it ever crossed your mind

989
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:14,443
或许没有我们 他能过得更好
that maybe he stands a better chance without us?

990
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,948
这不一样
It's just different.

991
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,041
怎么不一样了
How's this different?

992
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,343
就是不一样
It's just different!

993
01:00:20,344 --> 01:00:21,601
怎么操蛋的不一样了
How the fuck is it different?

994
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:24,485
我有过一个哥哥
We had a brother...

995
01:00:26,161 --> 01:00:28,607
在我记事之前就已经死了
...who passed away before you can even remember.

996
01:00:29,601 --> 01:00:31,843
他的状况和Rob差不多
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

997
01:00:32,002 --> 01:00:34,733
他状况糟透了 而且还得坐在轮椅上
He was all buggered up, and he was in a wheelchair.

998
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:37,110
老爸每天都揍他
Daddy beat his ass every single day.

999
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:39,092
把他当狗一样对待
Treated him like a dog.

1000
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:43,931
而我却什么也做不了  有不一样吗
And there's nothing we could do about it. Different.

1001
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,142
好吧 不提他了
Well, he gets a pass.

1002
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,026
我不知道为什么你什么都没说
I don't understand why you didn't say nothing.

1003
01:00:55,186 --> 01:00:56,632
你怎么从来没跟我们说起过
How come you never said nothing?

1004
01:00:57,879 --> 01:00:59,652
你想要我怎么说
What do you want me to say to you?

1005
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:02,734
对不起 行了吧
I'm sorry, all right?

1006
01:01:02,885 --> 01:01:04,566
但自从我见到这个小伙子开始
But ever since I've seen this fella,

1007
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:06,015
我就止不住的想起这件事
I can't stop thinking about it.

1008
01:01:14,286 --> 01:01:16,096
他怎么死的
How'd he die?

1009
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:17,705
他怎么死的
How'd he die?

1010
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:20,414
不知道 他就在那 然后死了
I don't know. He was there one day and gone the next.

1011
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:23,878
我问过老爸一次
I asked Daddy about it one time,

1012
01:01:23,879 --> 01:01:25,815
但他就当放屁一样什么也没听见
but that went over like a fart in church.

1013
01:01:32,649 --> 01:01:34,777
他叫什么
What was his name?

1014
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:43,340
- 他们没给他起名字   - 我操
- They never named him. - Fuck me.

1015
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:09,663
发现那几个狗杂种的了  就在前面
Got them bitches! Dead ahead!

1016
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:19,264
这次 尽量别伤着那个小兔崽子
And this time, try not to hit the motherfucking baby.

1017
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:24,699
他们来了
Here they come!

1018
01:02:24,855 --> 01:02:27,142
我给了所有她需要的
I'm giving it all she's got.

1019
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:28,776
Monaco什么也没留下
Monaco ain't got nothing left!

1020
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:30,504
绑紧Rob  他们来了 小伙子们
Strap in Rob! Here they come, boys!

1021
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,578
我操这些狗杂种要干嘛
What the hell is this motherfucker?

1022
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:36,928
嘿 Rottweiler
Hey, Rottweiler!

1023
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:38,180
你最好退到后面去 傻逼
You better back the fuck up, mutt!

1024
01:02:41,016 --> 01:02:43,019
圣诞快乐 混蛋
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

1025
01:02:46,257 --> 01:02:47,304
那孩子在后座上
The kid's in the back!

1026
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,283
他们把孩子带走了
They took the kid!

1027
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:11,427
我说了叫你绑紧他的啊
I thought I told you to strap him in!

1028
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,588
他们把门都给拉走了
They took the fucking door,

1029
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:14,231
老兄 我现在真的觉得
Man! I really don't think a fucking seatbelt

1030
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,189
重点不在安全带  快追啊
would have mattered right now! Go!

1031
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:26,004
他怎么样了
Hey, he all right?

1032
01:03:26,005 --> 01:03:27,431
谁他妈知道啊
How in the fuck do I know?

1033
01:03:28,302 --> 01:03:29,792
他们追来了  就像你说的
Here they come! Just like you said!

1034
01:03:31,982 --> 01:03:35,271
来副驾驶座这边  你会感兴趣的
Hey! Help the driver. You want to see this.

1035
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,664
看我们怎么操了你的保姆们
We're about to fuck your babysitters up.

1036
01:03:46,704 --> 01:03:48,945
- 来啊 小伙儿   - 来啊
- Come on, boy! - Whoo! Come on!

1037
01:03:50,624 --> 01:03:53,196
欢迎来到南部 狗杂种
Welcome to the South, motherfuckers!

1038
01:03:58,305 --> 01:04:01,036
怎么样啊 狗娘养的
Whoo! What you got now, bitches?!

1039
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:04,433
没时间了 贱人
Time out, bitch!

1040
01:04:21,868 --> 01:04:24,712
不是吧  真是的  不要
No. No, indeed. Hell no.

1041
01:04:24,868 --> 01:04:25,877
想想办法啊 你是军师
Do something, you're the brains!

1042
01:04:25,878 --> 01:04:26,916
我们必须得想想办法
We've gotta figure something out!

1043
01:04:27,068 --> 01:04:28,639
什么
What?!

1044
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:31,913
- 从顶上   - 从顶上
- Top rope! - Top rope!

1045
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,599
狗日的
Motherfuckers!

1046
01:04:47,991 --> 01:04:50,517
干了他们 Lincoln  上啊
Get them, Lincoln! Come on!

1047
01:04:55,752 --> 01:04:57,720
快干了他们
Go get 'em!

1048
01:04:57,872 --> 01:05:00,716
他们减速了  他们减速了
They're slowing down! They're slowing down!

1049
01:05:02,993 --> 01:05:04,483
上
Come on.

1050
01:05:09,273 --> 01:05:11,002
Lincoln
Lincoln!

1051
01:05:26,395 --> 01:05:28,045
我们没事
We're good!

1052
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:31,125
你还好吗 哥们
You all right, buddy?

1053
01:05:39,637 --> 01:05:41,639
你真是条汉子
You're one crazy redneck.

1054
01:05:48,598 --> 01:05:50,469
翅膀硬了是吗
Trying to be a tough guy? Huh?

1055
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,808
想从我们眼皮底下开溜
Running away from us?

1056
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,885
想来一根吗  你应得的
You want one of these? You've earned it.

1057
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:00,997
Linc怎么样了
How's Linc?

1058
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,363
不太乐观
Not so good.

1059
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:03,291
什么
What?

1060
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,284
你最好去看看他
You better check on him.

1061
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,283
你看好Rob了
You got Rob?

1062
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,291
操
Fuck.

1063
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:18,288
都是你干的吗
You do all this?

1064
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:22,211
老天爷干的
By God.

1065
01:06:25,162 --> 01:06:26,891
这可不是你的帽子 贱货
It ain't your hat, bitch.

1066
01:06:28,082 --> 01:06:30,689
干得好
Good work!

1067
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:33,005
让我看看
Let me take a look.

1068
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,086
来吧  让我看看
Come on. Let me see it.

1069
01:06:37,963 --> 01:06:40,205
靠
Shit!

1070
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:43,532
不夸张地说
Well, I think it's safe to say that, uh,

1071
01:06:43,684 --> 01:06:47,689
这已经远远超过McQueen能处理的范围
that surpasses McQueen's level of doctoring.

1072
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:50,517
- 我很好    - 你不好
- Fine.   - You are not fine.

1073
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:53,566
我们得检查检查
We need to get that looked at.

1074
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:55,101
我很好
Fine.

1075
01:06:55,102 --> 01:06:56,649
好吧  你很好
All right. You're fine.

1076
01:06:58,566 --> 01:07:00,614
好个屁
Fine, my ass.

1077
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:06,731
操
Fuck!

1078
01:07:17,168 --> 01:07:18,533
McQueen
McQueen!

1079
01:07:30,369 --> 01:07:34,773
Montane  你他妈死哪去了
Montane! Montane, where the fuck are you?

1080
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:39,257
狗屎
Shit.

1081
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:51,057
操你妈
Goddamn it!

1082
01:07:52,732 --> 01:07:53,972
嘿 要搭你们一程吗
Hey. You guys need a ride?

1083
01:08:06,813 --> 01:08:09,101
他妈的这些人搞什么鬼
Who are these fucking people?!

1084
01:08:09,974 --> 01:08:11,942
不用了 老兄 我们很好  走吧
Nah, man. We're good. Just keep going.

1085
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,216
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

1086
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:17,434
他制造了这些怪物
He practically made these monsters,

1087
01:08:17,435 --> 01:08:19,266
然后把他们晾出来
then hung them out to dry.

1088
01:08:19,415 --> 01:08:21,861
你玩儿我是吧
You gotta be kidding me.

1089
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:25,787
他们为什么没在为老子工作
And why aren't they working for me?!

1090
01:08:28,496 --> 01:08:31,818
快进到车里  我是个护士  我能帮上忙
Just get in the car. I'm a nurse. I can help.

1091
01:08:31,976 --> 01:08:33,467
这个主意不错
That ain't such a bad idea.

1092
01:08:35,337 --> 01:08:36,941
找到了
Bingo.

1093
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:40,784
发生什么事了
What happened here?

1094
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:43,308
那个是我干的
I did that.

1095
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:45,100
你指刺伤还是缝合
The stabbing or the stitches?

1096
01:08:45,258 --> 01:08:46,781
缝合
The stitches.

1097
01:08:46,782 --> 01:08:48,740
伤口已经感染了
Infection is setting in.

1098
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:51,509
我淋了威士忌在上面
I poured whiskey on it.

1099
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:53,502
我猜你是在电影里学的吧
Let me guess, you saw that in a movie?

1100
01:08:53,659 --> 01:08:56,230
是的  大部分
Yeah. Several.

1101
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:10,192
Rob
Hey-Hey,Rob?

1102
01:09:10,711 --> 01:09:11,588
这由你来保管 好吗
You hold onto that, all right?

1103
01:09:12,025 --> 01:09:13,856
你知道这是他最珍视的东西
You know that's his prize possession.

1104
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:16,336
等他好了他会需要的 好吗
He's gonna need it when he gets to feeling better, OK?

1105
01:09:22,702 --> 01:09:23,348
Chogan 我是Carlos
Chogan, this is Carlos.

1106
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:25,624
这是我给你下的最后通牒
I'm only calling as a last damn resort.

1107
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:27,684
有几个混蛋绑走了Rob 你给我去做了他们
Some asshole took Rob and I need you to kill him.

1108
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:28,750
把那小子给我带回来 如果可能的话
If you can, bring me back the kid,

1109
01:09:28,946 --> 01:09:30,038
否则就把他们全做了
and if not, then fuck it.

1110
01:09:30,182 --> 01:09:31,568
如果我得不到他 别人也休想
If I can't have him, nobody can.

1111
01:09:36,384 --> 01:09:37,749
他们没走远
They're close.

1112
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:39,633
走了
Finish up!

1113
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,634
他会好起来吗
He gonna be all right?

1114
01:09:54,626 --> 01:09:56,993
我说过 这取决于你
Like I said, it's up to you.

1115
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:04,556
你看起来很眼熟
You look really familiar.

1116
01:10:05,427 --> 01:10:06,310
- 是吗   - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1117
01:10:06,554 --> 01:10:08,079
你住过廉价汽车旅馆吧
Do you stay in shitty motels?

1118
01:10:08,253 --> 01:10:09,095
我是打扫的
'Cause we clean them.

1119
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:15,515
Crockett  我在那见过你
Crockett. That's where I've seen you.

1120
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,598
这世界真小
Small world.

1121
01:10:19,909 --> 01:10:21,911
你为什么不去当护士呢
So why ain't you a nurse?

1122
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:25,403
医院不雇用非法移民
Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.

1123
01:10:25,404 --> 01:10:27,154
为什么不是合法的
Why don't you become legal?

1124
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,916
你们国家的政策可没那么容易让我们合法
Your country doesn't make it that easy for us.

1125
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:31,071
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

1126
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:33,756
只要到那填好文件就行了
Just go down to the place and fill out your paperwork.

1127
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,356
告诉他们你想被法律认可就好了
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal.

1128
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,602
我是说 你不是会英语吗
I mean, you speak the language.

1129
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:40,516
在那每个人都说英语
That's more than most of them do out here.

1130
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:42,719
你的无知真是难以置信
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

1131
01:10:44,191 --> 01:10:46,843
好吧 没错 我只是个无知的硬汉
Yeah, well, I might be just an ignorant redneck,

1132
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:49,199
但至少我知道自己是什么样的人
but at least I know who I am.

1133
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,627
我是说 你是护士
I mean, you're a nurse.

1134
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:54,160
你就应该帮助别人
You ought to be helping people.

1135
01:10:54,313 --> 01:10:56,361
而不是刷马桶
Not scrubbing toilets.

1136
01:10:57,233 --> 01:11:00,487
这就是为什么你那么随心所欲吗
Well, is that why you do what you do?

1137
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:02,114
因为你是这样的人
'Cause it's who you are?

1138
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:08,237
我们就当是一家人在聊天吧
Let's just say it runs in the family. You know?

1139
01:11:09,594 --> 01:11:12,963
走上这一步你就别想有什么家人了
Well, you're not gonna have much family left at this pace.

1140
01:11:20,436 --> 01:11:23,406
听着 我真的很感激你为我们所做的一切
Listen, I really appreciate everything you've done for us.

1141
01:11:23,556 --> 01:11:26,605
我不能保证我能报答你 所以
I can't say that I'd exactly done the same thing, so...

1142
01:11:28,837 --> 01:11:30,566
不客气
You're welcome.

1143
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:36,562
如果 如果我说付你两千美元
What would you say if... if I offered you two grand

1144
01:11:36,717 --> 01:11:38,243
送我们到密西西比州的维克斯堡 你怎么说
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi?

1145
01:11:42,438 --> 01:11:46,125
如果我要说服你别去做你将要去做的事呢
What do you say I convince you not to do what you're about to do?

1146
01:11:47,959 --> 01:11:50,405
我能带你去任何别的地方
I could take you anywhere else.

1147
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:55,962
算了 我们必须去那里把事情解决 知道吗
Nah. This here's one of them kind of deals, you know?

1148
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,302
我们生命里的大部分时间
We kind of had people

1149
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:03,807
都由别人在掌控 你知道吗
controlling what we do our whole lives, you know?

1150
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:07,009
是时候让我们自己来掌握命运了
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

1151
01:12:53,921 --> 01:12:55,193
照顾好那孩子
Please keep the kid safe for me.

1152
01:12:57,027 --> 01:12:57,773
不会再出事了
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

1153
01:12:58,578 --> 01:13:00,079
不过我们得先把事情做个了结
We've just got a job to finish.

1154
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:01,793
我是外来的 但是我不傻啊
I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

1155
01:13:07,528 --> 01:13:09,769
- 谢谢你   - 再见
- Thank you. - See ya.

1156
01:13:11,728 --> 01:13:12,775
再见
See you around.

1157
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:24,613
我们还能用三千块钱填满个池塘吗
Can we still put a pool in with three grand?

1158
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,132
你在想什么啊
What you thinking?

1159
01:13:32,531 --> 01:13:34,340
在想打地鼠游戏啊
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

1160
01:13:34,491 --> 01:13:36,334
以后就两个人的话 情况会有点棘手啊
But it's gonna be tough with just two of us.

1161
01:13:38,691 --> 01:13:40,740
什么叫就两个人了
What you mean two?

1162
01:13:48,412 --> 01:13:49,414
这个正好
That's fitting.

1163
01:13:55,373 --> 01:13:57,775
- 想不想我再推高点   - 不用了
- You want to go high?  - No.

1164
01:14:09,095 --> 01:14:11,302
去吧 你跑回家去
You go and run in the house.

1165
01:14:12,735 --> 01:14:14,737
不管听到什么
No matter what you hear,

1166
01:14:14,738 --> 01:14:15,270
也不管别人怎么说
no matter what the people say,

1167
01:14:16,426 --> 01:14:17,408
爸爸做的 只是在尽我所能
Papaw did what he could to

1168
01:14:17,535 --> 01:14:18,684
为你创造更好的生活  明白吗
make things better for you than he had. OK?

1169
01:14:21,484 --> 01:14:22,190
去吧  跑过去
Go. Run along.

1170
01:14:30,537 --> 01:14:34,065
派遣员说你在这儿
Dispatch told me you'd, uh... you'd be here.

1171
01:14:34,218 --> 01:14:35,893
是吗 我倒很想给你倒杯茶
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea,

1172
01:14:35,894 --> 01:14:36,625
不过我习惯喝超浓的那种 都能杀死一头驴
but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

1173
01:14:37,231 --> 01:14:38,402
你大概会接受不了
It might be too strong for you.

1174
01:14:42,098 --> 01:14:46,937
你猜在所有南方人的习惯和优点中
You know, of all the Southern idioms and charms,

1175
01:14:47,611 --> 01:14:50,605
我觉得哪个最有价值
you know which one I find the most helpful?

1176
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:52,906
似火的热情吗
My extraordinary hospitality?

1177
01:14:55,428 --> 01:14:57,646
大家把什么东西都留着
The fact that nobody ever throws anything away.

1178
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:01,458
警长 我得把这个给你
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

1179
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,026
没有任何资料显示
There was nothing in any

1180
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:07,458
你跟他们有关系
database that ever connected you to them.

1181
01:15:09,993 --> 01:15:11,524
白天又没有收到电脑档案
Wasn't no computer files back in the day.

1182
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:14,501
阿拉巴马州的却已经过时了
Another perk of Alabama being behind the times.

1183
01:15:15,287 --> 01:15:17,225
书面记录太容易弄丢了
Paper trail easy as hell to get rid of.

1184
01:15:18,173 --> 01:15:20,969
所以这只能代表一件事 负责的是个黄毛小子
Only thing this proves is that a young deputy was doing his job.

1185
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:24,606
对对对 我就知道你会这么说
Right, right, right. Well, I figured you'd say that,

1186
01:15:24,769 --> 01:15:26,831
所以我仔细研究了
so I did a little further digging,

1187
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:29,157
然后找到了这个
and I found this.

1188
01:15:30,105 --> 01:15:32,333
Henry 你漏掉了一些文件
You missed some paper, Henry.

1189
01:15:33,573 --> 01:15:37,545
05年5月26日 你签了1200美元账单
You signed for $1,200 dollars on May 26th, '05,

1190
01:15:38,037 --> 01:15:40,161
07年6月15日 800美元
$800 June 15th, '07

1191
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:43,131
08年2月3日 1100美元
$1,100 on February 3rd, '08.

1192
01:15:43,382 --> 01:15:44,939
后面诸如此类
And it goes on and on and on.

1193
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:47,987
那些钱是用来清理犯罪现场的
That money was issued for crime scene clean up.

1194
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:50,182
我乐意雇谁做这事就雇谁
And I can hire anybody I damn well please.

1195
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:52,703
是吗 案件还没发生
Well, since when do people

1196
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:55,527
怎么就能清理现场了
get paid to clean up a crime before it happens?

1197
01:15:59,676 --> 01:16:01,236
警长 你确实是对的
You are right though, Sheriff.

1198
01:16:02,003 --> 01:16:04,601
你把犯罪率控制在全国最低
You've got the lowest crime rate in the state.

1199
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:08,455
所以你也就不用给他们太多钱了吧
You certainly weren't paying them much though, were you?

1200
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,419
难怪那些小崽子们都来找你
It's no wonder those dogs turned on you.

1201
01:16:14,423 --> 01:16:17,601
这样吧  这件事可以有两个结果
Now, listen. This story, you know, could end one of two ways.

1202
01:16:18,867 --> 01:16:21,225
要么 你帮我解决这事 跟我合作
You could either help me out, cooperate...

1203
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:24,010
要么 我现在就逮捕你
...or I could just arrest you on the spot.

1204
01:16:24,785 --> 01:16:26,120
然后我自己把他们一网打尽
Take them down myself, eventually.

1205
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,037
不管是哪个法子 我都得把你送进监狱
Look, either way, I've got to take you to prison,

1206
01:16:30,209 --> 01:16:31,393
但你要是表现良好
but you play nice,

1207
01:16:33,269 --> 01:16:34,677
你吃牢饭的日子就可以减少点
I'll see to it that your sentence is shortened.

1208
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:37,213
搞不好你还会有机会
Maybe one day you'll be able to

1209
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:39,237
看到你孙女从高中毕业呢
see your granddaughter graduate from high school.

1210
01:16:53,074 --> 01:16:55,645
我这可是出于职业的好意
Let's consider it a professional courtesy.

1211
01:16:57,474 --> 01:16:59,636
他们很快就会报复你的
They get big quick on you.

1212
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:03,322
你迟早会知道的
You'll find that out sooner or later.

1213
01:17:09,795 --> 01:17:12,242
- 跟我来   - 别 别这样
- Come with me. - No, no, no. Come on.

1214
01:17:12,396 --> 01:17:14,603
- 这样可不好   - 你省省吧
- I don't think so. - Cut that shit out.

1215
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:16,997
反抗是小孩子玩的把戏
Fighting's a young man's game.

1216
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:24,448
- 那你要去哪里   - 维克斯堡
- Where are you going, huh? - Vicksburg.

1217
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:27,885
这件事必须要我亲自了结
If anybody's gonna put an end to this, it's going to be me.

1218
01:17:29,998 --> 01:17:32,968
我才是有理由不相信你的人
You know, I'm the one that ain't supposed to be trusting you.

1219
01:17:33,118 --> 01:17:35,246
但是你赢了
Y'all won the damn war.

1220
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,573
Lincoln以前摔跤的时候
Now this is the same face

1221
01:17:44,574 --> 01:17:47,090
就会在脸上画这个
paint that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

1222
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,285
这样你跟我们就是一家人了
Solidifies you as one of us.

1223
01:17:55,597 --> 01:17:56,899
害怕吗
You scared?

1224
01:17:59,369 --> 01:18:00,324
现在你是Oodie家的一份子了
You're an Oodie now.

1225
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:01,899
你得克服恐惧
You got to swallow that fear.

1226
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:09,994
不过不管如何
For what it's worth,

1227
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:14,316
你承受过太多 该得到更好的回报
I think you deserve more than what you've been through.

1228
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:18,795
这不公平 就因为你不能自理
It ain't right, people taking advantage of you

1229
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:20,720
他们都利用你
just because you can't help yourself.

1230
01:18:23,918 --> 01:18:25,308
我知道在你的一生当中
I know you may not have had a

1231
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:27,746
可能不会出现多少值得尊敬的人
lot of people in your life you can look up to.

1232
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:33,342
该死的 我不是要你尊敬我们
Hell, I ain't telling you to look up to us.

1233
01:18:37,784 --> 01:18:38,856
我只是想让你知道
I just want you to know that

1234
01:18:39,762 --> 01:18:41,282
我们会尽我们所能
we're going to do everything we can

1235
01:18:41,444 --> 01:18:42,733
护你周全
to keep you from getting hurt.

1236
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:52,829
这个给你
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

1237
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:56,334
这是我的新装备
My new lookout.

1238
01:19:02,884 --> 01:19:04,168
你已经有了很大进步
You've been promoted.

1239
01:19:28,171 --> 01:19:29,775
空的
Empty-

1240
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:42,360
这不够
That ain't much.

1241
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,301
形势所迫
It's gonna have to do.

1242
01:19:51,734 --> 01:19:53,338
Lincoln情况不大妙
Lincoln don't look so good.

1243
01:19:56,014 --> 01:19:58,097
谁说的 他好多了
Yeah, he's been better.

1244
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:06,420
你觉得她会不会过来查看这件事
You think she's gonna come and see this thing through?

1245
01:20:06,576 --> 01:20:08,340
还是跑得远远的
Or is she just gonna run for the hills?

1246
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:11,783
这个到时候我们就会知道了
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

1247
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:14,660
是啊
Yeah.

1248
01:20:20,377 --> 01:20:25,145
你觉得上帝为什么要创造他那样的人
Why you reckon God would make someone like him?

1249
01:20:27,218 --> 01:20:28,708
什么
What?

1250
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:33,101
上帝为什么要让那么残忍的事发生在他身上
Why would God let something be wrong with him like that?

1251
01:20:38,739 --> 01:20:42,711
不知道  见鬼 我怎么会知道
I don't know. Hell, man, I don't know.

1252
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,306
该死的 干嘛要问我这个
Hell, why you asking me that, man?

1253
01:20:50,461 --> 01:20:53,908
不知道  只是好奇
I don't know. Just been thinking about it.

1254
01:20:56,741 --> 01:20:59,825
我不好奇上帝为什么要创造他那样的人
I don't ask why God made men like him.

1255
01:21:02,302 --> 01:21:04,953
我好奇上帝为什么要创造我们这样的人
I wonder why he made men like us.

1256
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,466
他们怎么样
How are the boys?

1257
01:21:43,067 --> 01:21:45,434
好吧
All right.

1258
01:21:47,627 --> 01:21:49,391
- 喂 Brick   - 怎么了
- Hey, Brick? - Hm?

1259
01:21:50,787 --> 01:21:52,631
我觉得我们当初应该把书念完的
I'm starting to think we should have finished school.

1260
01:21:55,388 --> 01:21:56,878
好歹我们也把初中念完了
At least junior high.

1261
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:19,272
马上就会结束了
It's almost over, bud.

1262
01:22:40,193 --> 01:22:42,480
- 该死的   - McQueen
- Oh, shit! - McQueen!

1263
01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:47,841
操他妈的箭  该死的
A fucking arrow, man? Fuck!

1264
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:02,681

01:23:18,384 --> 01:23:18,909

Shit.

1268
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,433
Brick Rob在哪里
Where's Rob, Brick?

1269
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:21,317
他没事
He's safe!

1270
01:23:25,407 --> 01:23:26,604
在这儿别动
Stay right here.

1271
01:23:26,605 --> 01:23:27,488
我得去补充点儿弹药
I've gotta go get some ammo.

1272
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:28,640
- 不行 我跟你一起去  - 你待在这儿
- No! I'm going with you.   - Stay here!

1273
01:23:28,799 --> 01:23:31,086
- 我要跟你一起去   - 操
- I'm going with you! - Fuck!

1274
01:23:31,559 --> 01:23:32,970
- 快啊   - 走
- Come on, man! - Go!

1275
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,301
该死的 拿把枪
Grab a gun. Fuck.

1276
01:23:42,302 --> 01:23:44,002
快他妈带我去找Rob
Take me to fucking Rob!

1277
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,526
你给我老实待在这儿
You're keeping your ass here!

1278
01:23:46,881 --> 01:23:49,282
有箭 我操
That was a fucking arrow, man!

1279
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:54,730
Brick

Time out, motherfucker! This ain't fun no more! Stop!

1282
01:24:05,643 --> 01:24:08,772
该死的 见鬼
Fuck me! Oh, shit.

1283
01:24:29,846 --> 01:24:31,052
我他妈不是叫你待这儿的吗
I told you to fucking stay here!

1284
01:24:31,206 --> 01:24:32,287
不准说什么早告诉你了之类的话
You're really gonna say I told you so right now?

1285
01:24:32,446 --> 01:24:33,811
你管好你自己的事吧
You mind yourself, woman!

1286
01:24:33,966 --> 01:24:36,253
该死的
Shit!

1287
01:24:40,647 --> 01:24:43,491
我的天
God!

1288
01:24:47,928 --> 01:24:49,676
不准再动了
Don't fucking move!

1289
01:24:49,677 --> 01:24:51,250
出来吧 出来呀
Come out, come out.

1290
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,892
你拿那个干嘛啊
What you gonna do with that, huh?

1291
01:24:57,049 --> 01:24:59,017
- McQueen   - 当心

1292

John Redcorn 你今天走霉运了
You're about to have a bad day, John Redcorn.

1293
01:25:31,933 --> 01:25:33,901
现在是谁在走霉运啊
Remind me again who's gonna have a bad day?

1294
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:01,704
真是稀奇
Ain't that a sight.

1295
01:26:53,462 --> 01:26:53,978
也就是说
So, uh...

1296
01:26:55,087 --> 01:26:56,845
你和你哥哥们绑架了这个孩子
you and your brothers kidnapped the kid from, uh...

1297
01:26:56,957 --> 01:26:57,846
这孩子是Martin女士的吧
...from Ms Martin, and

1298
01:26:58,025 --> 01:26:59,857
你们是不是打算借此索要赎金
you were planning on holding him for ransom?

1299
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:00,681
是不是
Yeah? All right.

1300
01:27:02,459 --> 01:27:03,235
没错
That's what I said.

1301
01:27:03,775 --> 01:27:06,940
那其他的那些人呢 他们是什么人
And what about these other men here? Who are they? Huh?

1302
01:27:12,443 --> 01:27:15,864
- 啊   - 好吧 算了
- Oh... - All right. All right.

1303
01:27:16,051 --> 01:27:16,847
反正以后再监狱里
You'll have plenty of time

1304
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:18,566
有的是时间思考答案
to think about your answers in prison. Yeah?

1305
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:30,518
你是Reese特工吗
Agent Reese?

1306
01:27:30,519 --> 01:27:32,070
你是特工Simmons吧 幸会啊

I'm very impressed with how you navigated these waters.

I'm putting in a request to have you take over this territory.

1311

这个地方很养人啊
It's a fine place to raise a family.

1317
01:27:47,668 --> 01:27:48,606
长官 我

我敢保证 她一定会喜欢这里的
I'm sure she'll love it.

1319

Hey! Fuck me!

1321
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,359

事情变成这样我很抱歉
I'm sorry it came down to all this.

1324
01:28:08,911 --> 01:28:11,642
没关系
Don't mention it.

1325
01:28:12,911 --> 01:28:15,676
只要把这小家伙照顾好就行了
Just make sure you take care of this little guy.

1326
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,920
他可是很难缠的啊
He's one tough cuss.

1327
01:28:22,112 --> 01:28:24,592
我们没干掉那混蛋 对不起啊
Sorry we didn't get the fucker.

1328
01:28:24,752 --> 01:28:27,120
没关系的  Carlos难逃一劫
That's all right. Carlos will get his.

1329
01:28:31,113 --> 01:28:34,917
那个 老兄 我能不能跟他单独相处一会儿
Hey, man, you think I could have a minute?

1330
01:28:34,918 --> 01:28:36,439
我哪儿也不会去的
I ain't going nowhere.

1331
01:28:36,594 --> 01:28:38,278
好吧
All right.

1332
01:28:40,074 --> 01:28:43,237
别哪样
Hey, stop that.

1333
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:55,244
要继承我们的优良传统哦
Make sure this shit didn't go down for nothing.

Well, ain't that some E.T. Shit?

1336
01:29:13,518 --> 01:29:15,964
你也知道Brick很别扭的 对吧
You know Brick's gay, right?

1337
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,965
Rob 再见
See ya, Rob.

1338
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,091
真是一波未平一波又起
The hits just keep on coming.

1339
01:29:40,921 --> 01:29:43,572
不过不管结果如何
No matter how this thing plays out...

1340
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:48,124
我为你们感到骄傲
...I'm proud of you boys.

Yeah, I'm fine. It's none of your goddamn business.

1350
