into a fucking baby?

Running low on milk, a few things.

137
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,209
I wonder where I could get all these
items in one convenient location?

138
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:55,007
– Walmart.
– Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

139

in the middle of a word like that.

I'm gonna start using that shit.

You see, guys, I kind of, uh…

142
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:09,479
…look at my future empire as the
Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

143
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,191
But, you know,

00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,785
and percentages and things like that,
well, see, that's partner talk.

from the lawn and garden department.

I like your son too.

00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,350

But some things, you just have
to stop them before they start.

156
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,276
See, partnership leads to ambition.

157
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,863
Ambition leads to a word
they don't use much any more.

158
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,617

– It's bad news.

162
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:32,688
Listen up, dipshits!
This here is Celeste.

163
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,900
And she'd like to give us an assload
of money to kidnap her godkid back

164
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,861
from her deadbeat ex-husband.
That about cover it?

165
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,114
– I guess so.
– Well, OK.

166
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,533
Let me just find my
missing persons report here,

167
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,077
and I'll get you right set up.

[giggles]
You out your damn mind, brother?

169
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,624
The big fellow over there,
that's Lincoln.

170
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,377
The mouthy little faggot here
is McQueen.

171
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,170
And I'm Brick.

172
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,758
Did you happen to mention that
kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

173
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,553
I was there this morning.

174
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,934
You was at church?

175
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,396
When I saw you guys take out that whole
house and walk out without a scratch,

176
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,565
I knew I found my guys.

[computer voice]
Bull sheet. What the catch?

178
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,657
Yeah. Why didn't you just
go to the cops with this?

179
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,496
His voice box was crushed
when he was a kid. He can't talk.

180
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,415
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

181
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,168
Why would he go and do
a dumb thing like that?

182
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,128
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

183
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,380
I just want to get Rob
and take him away from all this shit.

184
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:44,301
– That window closes Tuesday night.
– Do we look like FedEx to you?

185
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,428
– Shut up.
– You shut up.

186
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,180
– Shut up, man.
– You shut up.

187
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,015
I'm talking to the lady.
Shut up, man!

188
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,308
– Shut up!
– I just want peace of mind.

189
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,185
That's something the cops can't give me.

190
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,275
– And you think we can provide that?
– Yeah.

191
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:03,028
If he's arrested, he'll just get out
in 18 months and hunt me down.

This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

It is now. She just gave us

Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

197
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,758
It's a chance.

198
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,096
You wanted to be the last
true family man, Clark.

199
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,681
OK.

200
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:36,520
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

201
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,442
We'll even get your kid back.
But if this man, this, uh…

202
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,363
– Carlos.
– If he's as crazy as you say he is,

203
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,574
then why didn't he just kill
you in the first place?

204
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,913
He tried.

205
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,666
So when you leave,

206
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,919
it would be great if Lincoln
could put a boot through his skull.

You ladies have any other questions?

208
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,353
Henry, there's someone
in the back for you. In your office.

209
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,358
– Who?
– Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

210
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,319
– Cute, too.
– Yeah. Thanks for that.

211
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,655
I'll be sure to freshen up
before I go in.

212
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,552
Agent Reese. Henry Millard.

213
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,680
– Pleasure, sir.
– Well… [chuckles]

214
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,684
– We don't see suits in here much.
– Yeah, I can see why.

215
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,397
– How do people move in this heat?
– At our own pace.

216
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:06,067
So… [sighs]
what can I do you for?

217
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,739
Well, I wanted to ask you a few
questions regarding the shootout

218
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,532
that occurred earlier today.

219
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,951
We think we may have a lead
on some suspects.

220
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,496
– Is that a fact?
– Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

221
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:23,460
It was a… It's an interesting region
you have over here.

222
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,922
It seems every few months there's
a large number of violent offenders

223
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,717
that go missing or show up dead,
but there's never any leads.

224
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,305
Cases just… Go away.
It's very weird.

225
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,935
Well, I guess around here
finding justice for murderers

226
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,728
isn't a top priority.

227
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,565
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers?

228
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,277
I know all, son. But I can see you
came prepared for show and tell.

229
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:52,530
So… Get with the getting.

230
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,617
All right. Prime suspects!

231
00:17:55,784 --> 00:18:00,956
Case dating back to their father,
Jonathan Warren Oodie,

232
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,709
or Johnny Boy Oodie, as he was called.

233
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,212
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

234
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,840
Apparently, in his mid-twenties,
Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

235
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,428
Made things very colourful for local
law enforcement back in the day.

236
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:19,975
Flash-forward, KKK just about
dumbed themselves out of existence

237
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,894
and Johnny Boy went out
in a blaze of glory

238
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,939
during a federal drug raid
in March of '86.

239
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,567
No known mother to speak of, which
makes these three a Christmas miracle.

240
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,153
Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?

241
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,532
There were no grandparents or kin
suitable to take the children in,

242
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,243
so they were sent into foster care.

243
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,081
Then, when they became of age, they
started to become everyone's problem.

244
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,376
The oldest is Brick.
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.

245
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,963
Can't seem to stay out of trouble.
And boy, does he love his guns.

246
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,464
[gunfire]

247
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,800
Then it looks as though they tried
to go legit for a minute.

248
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:58,179
So they put their middle brother,
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.

249
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,433
He ended up killing
seven men in the ring. And guess what?

250
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,312
Absolutely nothing was done about it.
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,

251
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:10,316
saying it was accidental and part
of his neck-breaking gimmick.

252
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,737
And to make this giant fucker
even freakier, he cannot talk.

253
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,072
Or at least he couldn't
last time anybody checked.

254
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,534
Wrestled under the name
the Dixie Reaper.

255

He was well on his way

to becoming a real-life G. L. Joe.

258
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,210
But he's got a bit of an issue
with authority.

259
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,213
Whoo! [laughs]

260
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,591
That's a mighty fine
detective job you've done, son.

– Thank you, sir.
– But… It ain't as easy as all that.

262
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,642
– So you do know the Oodie Brothers?
– Like I said, I know all.

263
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,480
I can't just bring them boys in 'cause
some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

Well, you can if some suit

The longer you stay down here,
the more you're going to realise,

we don't like being
told what to do, son. Now…

…if you'll excuse me,
I got other work to attend to.

269

No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking
for, you know, a little cooperation.

270

Once this thing gets wrapped up,
I'll get out of your hair.

We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

I'll drive us

I know, right?

I mean, you'd think she'd have
some trust issues, right?

– But hey, each to their own.
– Each to their own, man.

Now, I know we've got
an address to Austin,

but shouldn't she have given us like
a picture of the kid or something?

How many kids you reckon
they got up there?

– OK.
– Yeah.

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,782
What if we get there
and Rob's a baby?

286
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,827
Well, if he's a baby,
they got baby junk up there.

– Oh, that's smart.
– It's not like they're riding around

– Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,760
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:26,596
Where'd you learn that word?
Inquisitive?

305

– Where the fuck did you pick that up?
– It's in my lexicon, man!

– Jackass. Yeah?
– I've got it up here.

There's a lot you
don't know about me.

you possibly have to do in Texas?

I took a job out here.

337
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:48,237
Oh, you took a job!
Well, excuse me.

338
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:53,117
What was I thinking? I forgot you guys
are freelance artists. So, Mr Brick,

339
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,579
– what job did you take?
– Look, it's not a big deal, man.

340
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,706
All right? It's just a little gig
out here. We can handle it.

341
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, you're going to handle it
like you handled me yesterday?

It's bad enough you can't
check a damn address,

343
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:04,921
but you also got to lay them
pork chops out in my backyard?

344
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,756
– Put it on our tab.
– What was that?

345
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,759
– Nothing!
– You watch your mouth, son.

346
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:13,221
This ain't a joke. This little misstep
is gonna be a pain for me,

I mean it, Brick. I better not hear shit
about your little Texas job.

Keep your ass off the grid.

Don't call my house.
Write this number down.

And for the love of God,
get rid of that damn cell phone.

I'll get my badge.

to blow the place to hell and back.

listen to me every now and then?

– He's inside getting something to eat

All right? What the hell
was that last night?

725
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,688

Rob back if you didn't kill him.

Well, evidently not, Brick!

Carlos, what would he want to do

with a kid in Rob's condition?

730
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:12,954
Carlos killed Rob's parents,
and then lied to me about it.

731
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,706
That might have been something
you wanted to mention.

All right, look. I'm sorry.

733
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,963
Rob has a trust
that matures when he's 18,

734
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:26,842
and as legal guardians, we would
get him and eventually the money.

That too might be something that
you wanted to mention! Fuck!

Rob's trust matures next week and…
Carlos will do anything to get it.

737
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:39,897
– Brick, you're all he's got.
– All right. New plan.

738
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:44,026
– You meet us halfway.
– Fine. Where?

be there as soon as I can.

741
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:56,414
And if you lie to me again,
Carlos will be the least of your worries.

742
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:59,584

now, don't you? Strippers like it.

Hand me a napkin, man.

Hey. Don't worry.

751
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:44,712
Don't worry, man.
Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,660
Think you can kidnap
some kid and get away with it?

760
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:23,209
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math,
five whore assassins

761
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,878
can't trump three retards
and a fucking cripple.

762
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:28,631
I mean, well,
according to my calculations,

763
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:30,883
they should be in your
area someplace by now.

764
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,219
But that's not my fucking job
to figure out, is it?

765
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:36,389
I mean, isn't owning
the road your goddamn job?

766
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,683
That's what I thought. OK.

767
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,435
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do.
Just get my boy back.

768
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,604
Yes! Get it done!

– We're in a world of shit down here.

772
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,449
Yeah, and now it's
spilling over into mine.

773
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:58,327
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg,
Mississippi. OK?

774
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:02,665
– Big Bayou Campground. We could…
– Stop. Stop! Shut up!

775
00:59:02,832 --> 00:59:05,209
Just shut the fuck up!
The less I know, the better.

776
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:08,796
– I taught you better than this!
– Look, I just thought that if,

777
00:59:08,963 --> 00:59:10,673
you know,
we could run in and do a quick…

778
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,386
Don't do that! Don't get ideas!
Just do what the fuck I say!

779
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,805
Things ran smooth when we did that,
didn't it?

780
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:20,725
I cleaned up your shit,
you took care of mine.

781
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,977
could have handled this hotshot.

782
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:25,730
But now this shit has gone public.

783
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,649
There's repercussions
to working for yourself.

784
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:31,902
– About time you learned that.
– Meaning what?

785
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,990
I got to cut ties, Brick.
I cleaned up everything on my end.

786
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:39,118
So, what you do from now on
rests solely on your shoulders.

787
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:43,289
If you come back here,
I got no choice but to put you down.

788
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,083
I got a family to protect.

789
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,924
I'll be sure to let the boys know
that we're on our own again.

790
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,093
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

Brick! We gots to go!

– You call Millard?
– Yeah.

799
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,111
Well, what did he say?

800
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,947
[male newscaster] The suspects
in question are believed to be

801
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:01,450
– Brick Oodie and his two brothers…
– Nothing.

802
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:04,912
They hail from the Atmore area,
located in Montgomery, Alabama.

803
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:08,123
They drew you to look like a fag.
Look at that.

– Come on! Come on, huh?

01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:21,637
– What are you do…?
– Come on!

I ain't gonna fucking hurt you,
you little faggot!

01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:26,141
– Stop, man!
– Come on! Come here!

– Fuck!
– What the devil got into you?

811
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:36,360

812
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,739
How you mean?

813
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:46,203
Uh, let's see. Millard won't have
anything to do with us any more

814
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,665
'cause he can't clean up that mess
with the biker chicks down at the bar.

815
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:52,543
So now we can't go back to 'Bama.

816
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,713
And all of them son of bitches
we mowed down in Austin?

817
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,966
– Guess what we missed.
– Carlos.

818
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:03,888
And he ain't gonna stop neither.
He's already tracked down Celeste.

819
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:08,225
So now we gotta get him to fucking
Vicksburg so they can disappear.

820
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,103
Well…

821
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,814
This is getting better by the minute.

822
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:21,030
Now, I like that little fella
just as much as anybody.

823
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:28,746
But tell me something. Just give me one
reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

824
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,833
They ain't got no other options.

825
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,169
Hell, we ain't got
no other options either.

826
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:40,841
I mean, look at us.
We can't even take care of ourselves.

827
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:43,552
Has it ever crossed your mind

828
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:47,097
that maybe he stands
a better chance without us?

829
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:51,894
– It's just different.
– How's this different?

830
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,563
– It's just different!
– How the fuck is it different?

831
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:57,566
We had a brother…

832
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:01,862
…who passed away
before you can even remember.

833
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:05,240
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

834
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,243
He was all buggered up,
and he was in a wheelchair.

835
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,790
Daddy beat his ass every single day.
Treated him like a dog.

836
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:17,836
And there's nothing
we could do about it. Different.

837
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:30,474
Well, he gets a pass. I don't
understand why you didn't say nothing.

838
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:34,228
– How come you never said nothing?
– What do you want me to say to you?

839
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,439
I'm sorry, all right?

840
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:40,859
But ever since I've seen this fella,
I can't stop thinking about it.

How'd he die?

842
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,414
– How'd he die?
– I don't know.

843
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,874
He was there one day and gone the next.

844
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:01,505
I asked Daddy about it one time,
but that went over like a fart in church.

845
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,848
What was his name?

846
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:19,773
– They never named him.
– Fuck me.

[gasps]

915
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,562
Fine, my ass.

916
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:54,941
[hissing]

917
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,943
Fuck!

918
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,247
McQueen!

919
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:26,181
Montane! Montane,
where the fuck are you?

920
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:30,852
Shit.

921
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:43,156
– [radio static]
– Goddamn it!

922
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,201
Hey, you guys need a ride?

923
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,967
Who are these fucking people?!

924
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,928
Nah, man. We're good.
Just keep going.

925
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:08,348
[Reese] Son of a bitch.

926
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:12,561
He practically made these monsters,
then hung them out to dry.

927
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,272
You gotta be kidding me.

928
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:19,359
And why aren't they working for me?!

929
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:25,657
Just get in the car.
I'm a nurse. I can help.

930
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:27,367
That ain't such a bad idea.

931
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,996
Bingo.

932
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:35,000
What happened here?

933
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:39,504
– I did that.
– The stabbing or the stitches?

934
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:43,300
– The stitches.
– Infection is setting in.

935
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,178
I poured whiskey on it.

936
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,263
Let me guess,
you saw that in a movie?

937
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:51,099
Yeah. Several.

938
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,655
Hey. Hey, Rob?

939
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:10,160
You hold onto that, all right?
You know that's his prize possession.

940
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:13,663
He's gonna need it when
he gets to feeling better, OK?

941
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:22,214
Chogan, this is Carlos.
I'm only calling as a last damn resort.

942
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,799
Some asshole took Rob
and I need you to kill him.

943
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:27,177
If you can, bring me back the kid,
and if not, then fuck it.

944
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:29,596
If I can't have him, nobody can.

945
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,392
They're close.

946
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,353
Finish up!

947
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,939
[engine revving]

948
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:50,951
He gonna be all right?

949
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,454
Like I said, it's up to you.

950
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,337
You look really familiar.

951
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:05,590
– Yeah?
– Yeah.

952
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:08,760
Do you stay in shitty motels?
'Cause we clean them.

953
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:13,765
Crockett.
That's where I've seen you.

954
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,977
Small world.

955
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:20,438
So why ain't you a nurse?

956
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:25,902
– Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.
– Why don't you become legal?

957
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,780
Your country doesn't
make it that easy for us.

958
01:13:28,947 --> 01:13:29,990
What are you talking about?

959
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:32,784
Just go down to the place
and fill out your paperwork.

960
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:36,788
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal.
I mean, you speak the language.

961
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:39,833
That's more than most
of them do out here.

962
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,127
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

963
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:46,423
Yeah, well, I might
be just an ignorant redneck,

964
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,883
but at least I know who I am.

965
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:54,055
I mean, you're a nurse.
You ought to be helping people.

966
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:56,349
Not scrubbing toilets.

967
01:13:57,267 --> 01:14:02,355
Well, is that why you do what you do?
'Cause it's who you are?

968
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,737
Let's just say it runs in the family.
You know?

969
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:13,658
Well, you're not gonna have
much family left at this pace.

970
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:24,544
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for us.

971
01:14:24,711 --> 01:14:27,881
I can't say that I'd exactly
done the same thing, so…

972
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,010
You're welcome.

973
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:38,266
What would you say if…
if I offered you two grand

974
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:40,018
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi?

975
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:48,234
What do you say I convince you not
to do what you're about to do?

976
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:52,697
I could take you anywhere else.

977
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:58,495
Nah. This here's one of them
kind of deals, you know?

978
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:06,670
We kind of had people controlling
what we do our whole lives, you know?

979
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,006
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

980
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:04,144
– Please keep the kid safe for me.
– Nothing bad's gonna happen.

981
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:08,606
– We've just got a job to finish.
– I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

982
01:16:13,111 --> 01:16:15,447
– Thank you.
– See ya.

983
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,575
See you around.

984
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:30,920
Can we still put a pool in
with three grand?

985
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:35,633
What you thinking?

986
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:41,055
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

987
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,141
But it's gonna be tough
with just two of us.

988
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,729
What you mean two?

989
01:16:55,737 --> 01:16:56,780
That's fitting.

990
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:05,497
– You want to go high?
– No.

991
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,594
You go and run in the house.

992
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:25,558
No matter what you hear,
no matter what the people say,

993
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:30,230
Papaw did what he could to make things
better for you than he had. OK?

994
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,524
Go. Run along.

995
01:17:39,656 --> 01:17:43,326
Dispatch told me you'd, uh…
you'd be here.

996
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:47,330
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea,
but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

997
01:17:47,497 --> 01:17:50,333
– It might be too strong for you.
– [chuckles]

998
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,668
Ah...

999
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:58,091
You know, of all
the Southern idioms and charms,

1000
01:17:58,258 --> 01:18:02,095
you know which one
I find the most helpful?

1001
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:04,013
My extraordinary hospitality?

1002
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:09,519
[Reese] The fact that nobody
ever throws anything away.

1003
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:13,398
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

1004
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:19,320
There was nothing in any database
that ever connected you to them.

1005
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:24,367
[Henry] Wasn't no computer
files back in the day.

1006
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,453
Another perk of Alabama
being behind the times.

1007
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,330
Paper trail easy as hell
to get rid of.

1008
01:18:30,415 --> 01:18:33,042
Only thing this proves is that
a young deputy was doing his job.

1009
01:18:34,002 --> 01:18:36,838
Right, right, right.
Well, I figured you'd say that,

1010
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:43,052
so I did a little further digging,
and I found this.

1011
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,887
You missed some paper, Henry.

1012
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:50,643
You signed for $1,200 dollars
on May 26th, '05,

1013
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,146
$800 June 15th, '07,

1014
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:55,899
$1,100 on February 3rd, '08.

1015
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:58,151
And it goes on and on and on.

1016
01:18:58,318 --> 01:19:01,404
[Henry] That money was issued
for crime scene clean up.

1017
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:04,991
And I can hire anybody
I damn well please.

1018
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:08,912
Well, since when do people get paid
to clean up a crime before it happens?

1019
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:15,668
You are right though, Sheriff.

1020
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:18,630
You've got the lowest
crime rate in the state.

1021
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:23,468
You certainly weren't paying
them much though, were you?

1022
01:19:23,635 --> 01:19:26,471
It's no wonder
those dogs turned on you.

1023
01:19:28,598 --> 01:19:33,019
Now, listen. This story,
you know, could end one of two ways.

1024
01:19:33,186 --> 01:19:35,730
You could either help me out,
cooperate…

1025
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:39,275
…or I could just arrest you
on the spot.

1026
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:42,737
Take them down myself, eventually.

1027
01:19:42,904 --> 01:19:44,781
Look, either way,
I've got to take you to prison,

1028
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:50,912
but you play nice, I'll see to it
that your sentence is shortened.

1029
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:54,457
Maybe one day you'll be able to see your
granddaughter graduate from high school.

1030
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,932
Let's consider it
a professional courtesy.

1031
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,103
They get big quick on you.

1032
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,940
You'll find that out sooner or later.

1033
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:28,241
– Come with me.
– No, no, no. Come on.

1034
01:20:28,408 --> 01:20:30,702
– I don't think so.
– Cut that shit out.

1035
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:33,204
Fighting's a young man's game.

1036
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:40,962
– Where are you going, huh?
– Vicksburg.

1037
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:44,549
If anybody's gonna put an end to this,
it's going to be me.

1038
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,846
You know, I'm the one that ain't
supposed to be trusting you.

1039
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:52,223
Y'all won the damn war.

1040
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:04,569
Now this is the same face paint
that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

1041
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,948
Solidifies you as one of us.

1042
01:21:14,579 --> 01:21:16,372
You scared?

1043
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:21,377
You're an Oodie now.
You got to swallow that fear.

1044
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:31,053
For what it's worth,

1045
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,724
I think you deserve more
than what you've been through.

1046
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,061
It ain't right,
people taking advantage of you

1047
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,189
just because you can't help yourself.

1048
01:21:43,608 --> 01:21:47,820
I know you may not have had a lot of
people in your life you can look up to.

1049
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:53,910
Hell, I ain't telling you
to look up to us.

1050
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:01,709
I just want you to know that we're
going to do everything we can

1051
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:03,252
to keep you from getting hurt.

1052
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,931
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

1053
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:18,017
My new lookout.

1054
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,400
You've been promoted.

1055
01:22:46,504 --> 01:22:47,630
Hm.

1056
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:51,634
Empty.

1057
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:06,774
– That ain't much.
– It's gonna have to do.

1058
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:16,200
Lincoln don't look so good.

1059
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:21,163
Yeah, he's been better.

1060
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,167
Hey.

1061
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:29,839
You think she's gonna come
and see this thing through?

1062
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:31,841
Or is she just gonna run
for the hills?

1063
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:35,428
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

1064
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:38,431
Yeah.

1065
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:49,358
Why you reckon God
would make someone like him?

1066
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:53,070
