251
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,950
×ÖÄ»
Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?

252
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,323
×ÖÄ»
There were no grandparents

253
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:51,193
×ÖÄ»
or kin suitable to take the children in,

254
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,796
×ÖÄ»
so they were sent into foster care.

255
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,844
×ÖÄ»
Then, when they became of age,

256
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:58,433
×ÖÄ»
they started to become everyone's problem

257
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,595
×ÖÄ»
The oldest is Brick. He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.

258
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,470
×ÖÄ»
Can't seem to stay out of trouble.

259
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,039
×ÖÄ»
And boy, does he love his guns.

260
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,714
×ÖÄ»
Then it looks as though they tried to go legit for a minute.

261
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,728
×ÖÄ»
So they put their middle brother,

262
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,922
×ÖÄ»
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.

263
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,042
×ÖÄ»
He ended up killing seven men in the ring. And guess what?

264
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:17,997
×ÖÄ»
Absolutely nothing was done about it.

265
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,754
×ÖÄ»
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,

266
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:24,555
×ÖÄ»
saying it was accidental and part of his neck-breaking gimmick.

267
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:27,843
×ÖÄ»
And to make this giant fucker even freakier, he cannot talk.

268
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:30,076
×ÖÄ»
Or at least he couldn't last time anybody checked.

269
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,397
×ÖÄ»
Wrestled under the name the Dixie Reaper.

270
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:36,240
×ÖÄ»
And then there's McQueen. Practically illiterate.

271
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:38,159
×ÖÄ»
He's the baby of the brood. He was well on his way

272
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:40,044
×ÖÄ»
to becoming a real-life G.I. Joe.

273
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,675
×ÖÄ»
But he's got a bit of an issue with authority.

274
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,562
×ÖÄ»
Whoo!

275
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,844
×ÖÄ»
That's a mighty fine detective job you've done, son.

276
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:51,888
×ÖÄ»
- Thank you, sir. - But... it ain't as easy as all that.

277
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:57,484
×ÖÄ»
- So you do know the Oodie Brothers? - Like I said, I know all.

278
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,903
×ÖÄ»
I can't just bring them boys

279
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,165
×ÖÄ»
in 'cause some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

280
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,647
×ÖÄ»
Well, you can if some suit

281
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,440
×ÖÄ»
from Chicago tells you to.

282
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:14,964
×ÖÄ»
The longer you stay down here, the more you're going to realise,

283
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,725
×ÖÄ»
we don't like being told what to do, son. Now...

284
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:20,884
×ÖÄ»
...if you'll excuse me, I got other work to attend to.

285
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,366
×ÖÄ»
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking for,

286
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,125
×ÖÄ»
you know, a little cooperation.

287
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,283
×ÖÄ»
Once this thing gets wrapped up, I'll get out of your hair.

288
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,091
×ÖÄ»
Why don't you let me worry about my county?

289
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,931
×ÖÄ»
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

290
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,769
×ÖÄ»
I'll drive us until I can't drive no more.

291
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:59,609
×ÖÄ»
Can you believe she went ahead and paid us five grand up front?

292
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:01,607
×ÖÄ»
I know, right?

293
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:06,533
×ÖÄ»
I mean, you'd think she'd have some trust issues, right?

294
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,416
×ÖÄ»
- But hey, each to their own. - Each to their own, man.

295
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:11,887
×ÖÄ»
Each to their own.

296
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,414
×ÖÄ»
Now, I know we've got an address to Austin,

297
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,799
×ÖÄ»
but shouldn't she have given

298
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,650
×ÖÄ»
us like a picture of the kid or something?

299
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:21,491
×ÖÄ»
How many kids you reckon they got up there?

300
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,649
×ÖÄ»
I mean, they ain't running a day-care centre.

301
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,329
×ÖÄ»
- OK. - Yeah.

302
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,609
×ÖÄ»
What if we get there and Rob's a baby?

303
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:34,533
×ÖÄ»
Well, if he's a baby, they got baby junk up there.

304
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:36,656
×ÖÄ»
- Oh, that's smart. - It's not like they're riding around

305
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:40,131
×ÖÄ»
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing. I mean, come on.

306
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:41,624
×ÖÄ»
Besides that, them bullet

307
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,135
×ÖÄ»
scars didn't look too fresh on Celeste's belly.

308
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:45,780
×ÖÄ»
- You're right. You're right. - Yeah.

309
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:55,918
×ÖÄ»
- What if there's more than one kid?

310
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,735
×ÖÄ»
- Why are you asking me so many

311
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,622
×ÖÄ»
goddamn questions, man? We just went over this! What?

312
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:01,694
×ÖÄ»
What do you want to know?! What do you want to know?!

313
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:05,140
×ÖÄ»
- How will we know which is Rob? - I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

314
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,326
×ÖÄ»
How about that? I'm gonna say,

315
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:07,533
×ÖÄ»
"You know what, I don't want Kevin!

316

×ÖÄ»
I don't want Michael! No, I don't want Stephen!"

317
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:10,432

If there's a bunch of

fucking kids around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!

×ÖÄ»
How about that? Fucking hell, man!

320
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,935
×ÖÄ»
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

321
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:20,336
×ÖÄ»
We smash whoever's in front of us and we take Rob!

Damn! Plain and simple! What? Sorry, Lincoln.

- Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

325
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,096
×ÖÄ»
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

326
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,826
×ÖÄ»
Where'd you learn that word? Inquisitive?

327
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:36,980
×ÖÄ»
- Where the fuck did you pick that up? - It's in my lexicon, man!

- Jackass. Yeah? - I've got it up here.

There's a lot you don't know about me.

Are you ready for a potty break?

Shh.

It's bad enough you can't check a damn address,

×ÖÄ»
Guess not.
