00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:11,431

消停点! 好好学学怎么说话
Stop it! If you had bothered to learn the language,

37
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:09,395
你知道你可以对我说什么吗
you know what you could be saying to me right now?

38
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,145
你知道你能说什么吗
Do you know what you could be saying?

39
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:12,482
你可以说,"嘿 老兄
You could be saying, "Hey, man,

40
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:14,588

有人希望你永远地离开
Somebody wanted you gone,

53

You know? So I'm sorry. But just so you know,

55
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:58,109
这无关个人 好吗
this ain't nothing personal. All right?

56
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:01,287
你不会相信的
You ain't gonna believe this.

57
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:03,199
什么

我们真的找错了
We got the wrong house.

59
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:14,083
这破事要怎么解决
Oh, this shit ain't gonna turn out well!

60
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:15,274
没听见吗 
You don't listen, man!

61
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:18,472

You're like MacGruber! Goddamnit, man!

62
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:19,507
可不是么
Well, ain't that some shit.

63
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,785
- 警长   - 怎么回事
- Sheriff? - What's the story?

64
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,698
一个不留的大屠杀
It's just an all-out massacre.

65
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,914
十三具尸体 一堆堆的毒品

66
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,892
枪支 唾液还有混球 一团糟
guns, spit and ass. It's a mess.

67
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,544
什么人干的?
So who were these miscreants?

68
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,344
没人有什么可疑的地方
No one appeared to be anybody special.

69
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:58,391
只有几个普通的店家和几辆破车
Just run-of-the-mill dealers and bangers.

70
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:01,134
- 有证人吗   - 呃 你知道的
- Anybody talking? - Ah, you know how it is.

71
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:02,992
什么也没听见 什么也没看见
Nobody heard nothing, nobody saw nothing,

72
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:04,231
没人跟警察说话
and nobody talks to the po-po.

73
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:05,812
好吧 这听起来倒像那么回事
Yeah, that sounds about right.

74
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,321
写好必要的文件
Fill out all the necessary paperwork,

75
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:08,559
把尸体运走
run the bodies through the county.

76
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,862
报告放我桌上
Have the report on my desk.

77
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:14,354
长官 恕我擅自行动
Sir, I also took the liberty

78
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,244
继续查案以解决事件去了
to go ahead and put it out over the wire.

79
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:17,873
看看我们能不能揪出凶手
See if we can get a bead on these shooters.

80
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,004
为什么要这样做
Now, why would you go and do that?

81
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,706
加快案件的审理啊
Trying to speed things along.

82
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,158
哟
Oh!

83
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:24,439
你是说我的工作做不好咯   
You think I can't do my job.

84
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,624
我只是想...
I just thought...

85
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,422
不要自作主张 什么都别做!
Don't do that! Don't ever do that.

86
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,837
就照我说的做
Just do as you're told.

87
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:41,310
- 什么事都没有?   - 是的!
- Nothing? - Nope!

88
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,271
- 一点都没追究?   - 嗯哼
- Not even half? - Mm-mm.

89
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:51,193
这不太对! 豁出了老命却一毛钱都拿不到
Something's gotta change! Risking our necks for no money.

90
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:54,075
胡说
This some bullshit!

91
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:55,931
这样的日子我已经厌烦了
I'm about tired of us getting

92
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,328
每天都在折腾却一无所获 听见没
fucked six ways from Sunday, you hear me?

93
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,168
该死
Goddang, man!

94
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,294
我本来想泡在钱堆里的
I was gonna put a pool in with that money.

95
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:14,140
该死 混账东西
Goddang, motherfucker!

96
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:18,555
别吵了 走开 狗娘养的
Stop! Yeah, walk away, bitch!

97
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,818
小子 你该庆幸我现在没心情抽你屁股吧！
You lucky I ain't in the mood to whip your ass, boy!

98
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,655
又浪费粮食 混账
Wasting food, motherfucker.

99
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,946
- 需要帮忙吗?   - 噢 见鬼
- Can I help you? - Oh, shit!

100
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:09,238
- 抱歉 你吓到我了   - 效果不错
- Sorry. You scared me. - That's what I do.

101
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:14,384
我是Celeste  
I'm Celeste.

102
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,838
我想跟你和你的朋友们谈谈
I was hoping to talk to you and your friends.

103
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:21,258
朋友们? 我可没什么朋友
Friends? I ain't got no friends.

104
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:24,134
只有一帮兄弟
I've got my brothers.

105
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:27,925
房子 车
Got my house. My car.

106
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,807
还有在我面前的面前迷人的小Chica
I've got a sexy little chica standing in front of me.

107
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,397
可我没朋友
But I ain't got no friends.

108
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,229
你想做我朋友吗
You wanna be my friend?

109
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,113
今天早上的事我都看见了
I saw you this morning.

110
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,070
我想让你们也帮我做点事情
I was hoping to acquire your services.

111
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,205
那你找错人了 今天早上我们在教堂
You got the wrong fellas. We was at church this morning.

112
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,249
- 是吗   - 没错
- Really? - Yeah.

113
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,626
所以今天早上在Bacon街横扫整幢房子的
So there's just three other white boys that looked just like you

114
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:55,003
那三个白人小子只是长得像你们咯
that ripped up a whole house on Bacon Street?

115
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,315
好好想想 怎么多的证人
Trying to figure out how you

116
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,376
你们要怎么走出这个地方
guys walked out of there with all those witnesses.

117
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,673
还有那么多的警察 你们应付得来么
And every cop in the state isn't lined up at your door.

118
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:12,928
那么 你这么漂亮的女孩
So, what's a pretty little

119
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,517
在那么乱的街区去又是有何贵干呢
girl like you doing in a neighbourhood like that?

120
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:17,815
我是想去雇个壮汉...   
Well, I was there to hire muscle...

121
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,361
雇他去干嘛
Hire him to do what?

122
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:23,705
从我前夫那要回我的儿子
Get my godson back from my ex-husband.

123
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:27,916
我先来的
Dibs.

124
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:34,334
畜生!混账!
Dang it! Cock-blocking motherfucker!

125
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:40,797
女士 我想你并不清楚你在做什么
Lady, I'm not sure what it is you think you're doing,

126
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:44,890
但那确实不是我们擅长的方向
but that's not exactly our line of expertise.

127
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,768
- 我付得起钱   - 多少
- I got money. - How much?

128
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,266
一万
Ten thousand.

129
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:55,860
而且我也觉得救人这种事不太适合我们
Yeah, I don't think saving people is really for us.

130
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:58,276
你干嘛不把这事交给警察去做呢
You know? Why don't you take that shit to the cops?

131
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,908
他们可不收钱
They'll do it for free.

132
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,121
两万五
Twenty-five thousand.

133
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:07,337
先付五千
Five thousand up front.

134
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,439
进来见见弟兄们吧
Come on inside and meet the boys.

135
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:43,435
这就是我要说的 流畅的线条 剖面光滑
This is what I'm talking about. Clean lines, nothing to profile.

136
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,265
也没有那种旋扣器 
None of that spinner,

137
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:45,969
该死的会抬升汽车的液压装置
hydraulic shit to get you lit up.

138
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,588
Sal 我的意思是
What I'm talking about, Sal,

139
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,336
所有东西你都可以用这辆二手的现代索纳塔运
is you transporting anything and everything

140
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:53,259
这就是原因
in this pre-owned Hyundai Sonata. And here's the reason why.

141
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,220
隐藏的隔间 上面涂有咖啡豆粉和滑石膏
Hidden compartment. Coated with coffee bean and talcum paste

142
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,554
缉毒犬是闻不出来的
no drug dog on the planet Earth can sniff out.

143
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:03,103
完全不用担心 下个月的这个时候
This space is worry-free, and this time next month,

144
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,350
我要生产出一批这样的车
I'm gonna have a fucking fleet of them.

145
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:06,131
真是紧   
Damn, that's tight.

146
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,862
听见了吗 爸 时间很紧
Hear that, Dad? It's tight.

147
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:13,753
那么 你们怎么想 弟兄们
So, what do you say, boys?

148
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,365
能帮我跑跑腿吗
You want to take a few road trips for me?

149
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:17,828
当他妈然啦 Carlos
Abso-fucking-lutely, Carlos.

150
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:21,039
我们当然不介意当你的骡子 
We surely don't mind being your fucking little mule,

151
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,500
Don Carlos
Don Carlos.

152
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:27,592
我们得讨论讨论分成
But we gotta talk about our cut.

153
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:32,092
我们总是冒风险的那个
We're the one doing all the risks.

154
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:35,118
我刚刚想起点事
You know, I just remembered something.

155
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,973
我要电池和厕纸
I need batteries and toilet paper.

156
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:38,724
我还要那部布拉德皮特的电影
And I need to get that Brad Pitt movie.

157
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,769
大概是他变回婴儿的那部
The one where he turns back into a fucking baby?

158
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,897
没有足够的奶喝 之类的
Running low on milk, a few things.

159
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,682
我想知道我能上哪很方便地弄到
I wonder where I could get

160
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:49,366
所有的这些东西
all these items in one convenient location?

161
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:50,322
沃尔玛  
Walmart.

162
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:55,158
沃他妈尔玛 就是这个
Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

163
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:56,171
我很喜欢你们这样
I love the way you put

164
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:57,871
把"他妈"放在每个词里
"Fucking" In the middle of a word like that.

165
00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:00,417
我以后也要这样说话
I'm gonna start using that shit.

166
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,583
你瞧 朋友们 我有点,呃...
You see, guys, I kind of, uh...

167
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:06,424
看我的未来帝国
...look at my future empire

168
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,635
就像看待沃尔玛的零售犯罪
as the Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

169
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:11,366
但我们不可能每个人都成为
But, you know, we can't all be

170
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,346
山姆沃尔顿
Sam Walton.

171
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,515
{\pos(192,26)}沃尔玛的开办人

172
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,154
那是我的大业
That's my job.

173
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:20,067
当我的步兵开始谈论像分成
And when my foot soldiers start talking about shit like cuts

174
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:22,244
诸如此类的鬼话题时
and percentages and things like that,

175
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,937
这可是合伙人的谈话
well, see, that's partner talk.

176
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:27,033
我需要的不是合伙人
And I don't need a partner.

177
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:28,807
我要的是装料工 出纳员 
I need stockers and cashiers and

178
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,450
雇佣兵 还有苦力们
 mercenaries and mules.

179
00:12:31,611 --> 00:12:33,498
想当初 我发现你的时候
And in your case, Padre,

180
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36,205
Padre 你只是我在园艺部门碰巧遇到的
dime-bag dealers from the lawn and garden department.

181
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:38,752
廉价包经营商
Coincidentally, where I found you.

182
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:41,650
现在呢 Padre 我很喜欢你 真的 
Now, Padre, I like you. I really do.

183
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,509
我也喜欢你儿子
I like your son too.

184
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,840
我真的很感激你们父子为我做的那些破事 
I really appreciate all the shit you've done for me,

185
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:46,514
你懂得
you know,

186
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,758
上帝不想看见的那些事
that God wouldn't be proud of.

187
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:54,095
可是有些事 你还是掐灭苗头
But some things, you just have to stop them before they start.

188
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:56,432
合作可是野心的祸端
See, partnership leads to ambition.

189
00:12:56,598 --> 00:13:00,026
而野心通向的是一个人们鲜少用到的词语了
Ambition leads to a word they don't use much any more.

190
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,775
叛乱
Mutiny.

191
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:29,393
- 爸爸 那是什么   - 是坏消息
- Papa, what's that? - It's bad news.

192
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,849
听好了 笨蛋们 这是Celeste
Listen up, dipshits! This here is Celeste.

193
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,462
她要给我们
And she'd like to give us

194
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,070
一大笔钱去把她儿子从她那个游手好闲的前夫
an assload of money to kidnap her godkid back

195
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:40,025
手里拐回来 这样说对吗
from her deadbeat ex-husband. That about cover it?

196
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,276
- 我想是吧   - 好吧
- I guess so. - Well, OK.

197
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,695
让我先找找这里的失踪人员报导
Let me just find my missing persons report here,

198
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,244
再给你个方案
and I'll get you right set up.

199
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:50,121
你心思暴露了 老兄
You out your damn mind, brother?

200
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:52,786
那边的大家伙 是Lincoln
The big fellow over there, that's Lincoln.

201
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,538
说大话的笨蛋是McQueen
The mouthy little faggot here is McQueen.

202
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:57,342
我是Brick
And I'm Brick.

203
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:59,174
你跟她提过
Did you happen to mention

204
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:01,924
绑架不是我们真正的营生吧
that kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

205
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:04,721
我早上也在那
I was there this morning.

206
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,108
你在教堂?
You was at church?

207
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:12,479
当我看见你们几个把整座屋子都
When I saw you guys take out

208
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,562
摆平后毫发无伤地出来时
that whole house and walk out without a scratch,

209
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:16,731
我就知道你们就是我要找的人
I knew I found my guys.

210
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:22,700
狗屁 一定有内幕
Bull sheet. What the catch?

211
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,825
是啊 你干嘛不去找警察呢
Yeah. Why didn't you just go to the cops with this?

212
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,672
他小时候喉头被毁坏了 不能说话
His voice box was crushed when he was a kid. He can't talk.

213
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,584
因为我跟她说过我们能做到
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

214
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,333
为什么他要做这么件傻事呢
Why would he go and do a dumb thing like that?

215
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,304
因为你们是我唯一能找到的帮手了
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

216
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,549
我只想要回Rob 带他离开这一切
I just want to get Rob and take him away from all this shit.

217
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,707
周二晚上就没有办法了
That window closes Tuesday night.

218
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,474
我们看起来像联邦快递吗
Do we look like FedEx to you?

219
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,605
- 闭嘴   - 你闭嘴
- Shut up. - You shut up.

220
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,352
- 你才闭嘴   - 你闭嘴
- Shut up, man. - You shut up.

221
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,186
我在跟这位女士说话 闭上你的嘴
I'm talking to the lady. Shut up, man!

222
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,476
- 闭嘴!   - 我只想彻底解脱出来
- Shut up! - I just want peace of mind.

223
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,362
而警察给不了我
That's something the cops can't give me.

224
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:00,455
- 你觉得我们可以?   - 是的
- And you think we can provide that? - Yeah.

225
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,275
要是他被捕了
If he's arrested,

226
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,196
18个月后他出来然后又找到我
he'll just get out in 18 months and hunt me down.

227
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,868
我们又不是Oodie兄弟公司
This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

228
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,008
现在是了 
It is now.

229
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:12,333
她给了我们两万五的理由开张
She just gave us 25,000 reasons to open up shop.

230
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:16,472
预付的五千
Five up front.

231
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,261
弟兄们 这就是我们一直在等的
Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

232
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,935
这是个机会
It's a chance.

233
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:27,366
你不是想成为最后一个顾家好男人么 
You wanted to be the last true family man,

234
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,271
Clark
Clark.

235
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,858
好吧
Ok.

236
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:36,695
好吧 女士 你的钱我们收下了
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

237
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:39,732
我们会把你的孩子弄回来 
We'll even get your kid back.

238
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:42,622
但这个男人 这个 呃
But if this man, this, uh...

239
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:43,726
Carlos   
Carlos.

240
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,544
要是他像你说的这么疯狂
If he's as crazy as you say he is,

241
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:49,752
他干嘛不一早就杀了你
then why didn't he just kill you in the first place?

242
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,097
他试过
He tried.

243
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:57,100
所以你们走的时候
So when you leave,

244
00:15:57,287 --> 00:15:58,402
如果Lincoln
it would be great

245
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:01,105
能爆了他的头那是再好不过了
if Lincoln could put a boot through his skull.

246
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,819
女士们 还有疑问吗
You ladies have any other questions?

247
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,542
Henry 有人在后面等你 办公室里
Henry, there's someone in the back for you. In your office.

248
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:19,220
谁啊   
Who?

249
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:23,538
Anthony Reese 是ATF的探员
Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

250
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,108
{\pos(192,26)}烟酒、火器与爆炸物管理局

251
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:24,151
- 还很可爱   - 多谢
- Cute, too. - Yeah. Thanks for that.

252
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:28,836
我进门之前会整理一番的
I'll be sure to freshen up before I go in.

253
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,701
Reese探员 
Agent Reese.

254
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:50,305
我是Henry Millard
Henry Millard.

255
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,865
- 荣幸之至 先生   - 好吧
- Pleasure, sir. - Well...

256
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,401
我们这儿穿正装的可不多见   
We don't see suits in here much.

257
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:57,871
是啊 我想我明白为什么
Yeah, I can see why.

258
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,078
人们怎样能生活在这么热的地方   
How do people move in this heat?

259
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,588
我们一直如此
At our own pace.

260
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:06,259
那么...我能帮你什么呢
So... what can I do you for?

261
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:10,926
我想问几个问题
Well, I wanted to ask you a few questions regarding the shootout

262
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,727
是关于今天早上的枪战
that occurred earlier today.

263
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:15,137
我们认为可以确定几个嫌疑人
We think we may have a lead on some suspects.

264
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,687
- 那是真的?   - 是的 先生 没错
- Is that a fact? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

265
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,653
这原来...这是个很有意思的地方
It was a... It's an interesting region you have over here.

266
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,023
每隔几个月
It seems every few months

267
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:27,110
这里都有一大批暴力的罪犯
there's a large number of violent offenders

268
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:30,905
要么失踪 要么被发现死亡 没有任何征兆
that go missing or show up dead, but there's never any leads.

269
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,495
案件就...那么了断了 真是离奇呢
Cases just... go away. It's very weird.

270
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:40,126
我觉得现在为杀人犯谋求正义
Well, I guess around here finding justice for murderers

271
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:41,926
不是当务之急吧
isn't a top priority.

272
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,754
也对 你知道 Oodie兄弟吗
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers?

273
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,102
我都知道 孩子
I know all, son. But I

274
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:49,468
但我能看出你准备好要演说一番啊
can see you came prepared for show and tell.

275
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:52,729
所以...开始吧
So... get with the getting.

276
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:55,816
好吧 头号嫌犯!
All right. Prime suspects!

277
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:57,967
案子始于他们的父亲 
Case dating back to their father,

278
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:01,146
Jonathan Warren Oodie
Jonathan Warren Oodie,

279
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:02,871
或者Johnny Boy Oodie吧 
or Johnny Boy Oodie,

280
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:04,906
大家这样叫他的
as he was called.

281
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:07,403
我猜你会很喜欢他
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

282
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:09,152
显然 在他二十几岁时
Apparently, in his mid-twenties,

283
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:11,033
Johnny Boy加入了3K党
Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

284
00:18:11,198 --> 00:18:12,889
对当时的地方法的执行来说
Made things very colourful

285
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,623
真是添了不少看点
for local law enforcement back in the day.

286
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:19,833
提前说一句 3K党就要销声匿迹的时候
Flash-forward, KKK just about dumbed themselves out of existence

287
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:20,734
Johnny Boy
and Johnny Boy

288
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,917
在86年3月的一次联邦毒品突击中
went out in a blaze of glory

289
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,137
带着荣誉死亡了
during a federal drug raid in March of '86.

290
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:27,644
没人知道孩子的母亲是谁
No known mother to speak of,

291
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:29,762
他们三个的来历成了圣诞奇迹
which makes these three a Christmas miracle.



292
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,347
听起来熟悉么 Sheriff? 没有吗
Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?

293
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,779
没有爷爷奶奶
There were no grandparents

294
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,728
或者亲戚可以适合带孩子的
or kin suitable to take the children in,

295
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:38,443
所以他们被送到寄养者家里了
so they were sent into foster care.

296
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:40,578
然后 当他们越来越大时
Then, when they became of age,

297
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,278
他们成为所有人的麻烦了
they started to become everyone's problem

298
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,232
年龄最大的是Brick 
The oldest is Brick.

299
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:46,575
简直就是他父亲的翻版
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.

300
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:48,530
似乎天生就无法与麻烦绝缘
Can't seem to stay out of trouble.

301
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:50,166
而且这小子爱极了他的枪
And boy, does he love his guns.

302
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,998
来他们似乎想试试遵守下法律
Then it looks as though they tried to go legit for a minute.

303
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:56,098
就把中间那个兄弟
So they put their middle brother,

304
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,386
Lincoln留在了环形拳击场的南方
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.

305
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:01,639
他最终在拳击场杀了7名男子 你猜怎么着
He ended up killing seven men in the ring. And guess what?

306
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:03,677
绝对什么都没有了
Absolutely nothing was done about it.

307
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,509
也不是 发起人并没有起诉他
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,

308
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,370
说这只是一场意外 
saying it was accidental

309
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,515
而他脖子被扭断的那部分是骗人的玩意
and part of his neck-breaking gimmick.

310
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,417
然后这个人渣从此变得更加捉摸不定 
And to make this giant fucker even freakier,

311
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:13,944
他不能说话了
he cannot talk.

312
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,272
至少上次检查的时候是不能的
Or at least he couldn't last time anybody checked.

313
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:17,270
那时他正以Dixie Reaper的名号
Wrestled under the name

314
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,735
纵横摔跤界
the Dixie Reaper.

315
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,699
再有就是McQueen  他几乎是文盲
And then there's McQueen. Practically illiterate.

316
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,700
他在内心深处就是个婴儿 他想他自己的方式
He's the baby of the brood. He was well on his way

317
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,666
成为现实中的"特种部队"
to becoming a real-life G.I. Joe.

318
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:26,666
{\pos(192,26)}美国90年代动画，讲述反恐部队和恐怖组织对抗的故事

319
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:29,409
但是很明显他和权威不能相溶
But he's got a bit of an issue with authority.

320
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,456
真是漂亮的侦查工作 孩子
That's a mighty fine detective job you've done, son.

321
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,288
谢谢 先生   
Thank you, sir.

322
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:39,016
但是 做起来可没有你说说那么容易
But... it ain't as easy as all that.

323
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:42,703
所以你知道Oodie兄弟么   
So you do know the Oodie Brothers?

324
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,851
我说过 我全知道
Like I said, I know all.

325
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,330
我不能把男孩们带过来
I can't just bring them boys

326
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:48,689
仅仅因为某个费城来的制服男想要我这么做
in 'cause some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

327
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:54,405
嗯 如果某个从芝加哥来的制服男要求你
Well, you can if some suit

328
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:58,360
你就会这么做了吧
from Chicago tells you to.

329
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:03,077
你呆在这里的时间越长 你就越会明白
The longer you stay down here, the more you're going to realise,

330
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,448
我们不喜欢被要求要做什么 孩子  
we don't like being told what to do, son.

331
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:05,956
现在...
Now...

332
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:06,929
... 如果你不介意 
...if you'll excuse me,

333
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,250
我还有其他工作要处理
I got other work to attend to.

334
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:11,838
不 Sheriff  听着 我只是想要些
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking for,

335
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,672
你懂的 一个小小的合作
you know, a little cooperation.

336
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,922
一旦这个事情告一段落 我就不再缠着你了
Once this thing gets wrapped up, I'll get out of your hair.

337
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:17,808
你为什么就不能让我把心思放在我的小镇呢
Why don't you let me worry about my county?

338
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,666
午夜的时候我们能到Dallas
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

339
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,625
我可以开到开不下去为止
I'll drive us until I can't drive no more.

340
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,000
你能想象她就这么走向前 
Can you believe she went ahead

341
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,629
然后预付了我5000块么
and paid us five grand up front?

342
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,712
我知道 不是么
I know, right?

343
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:54,659
我是说 
I mean,

344
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,849
你会认为她有一些信任方面的问题 对吧
you'd think she'd have some trust issues, right?

345
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,606
嘿 是他们中的每一个人   
But hey, each to their own.

346
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,560
他们中的每一个人都有 伙计
Each to their own, man.

347
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,878
他们中的每一个人
Each to their own.

348
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,152
现在 我知道我们有到Austin的地址
Now, I know we've got an address to Austin,

349
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,596
但是难道她不应该给我们
but shouldn't she have given

350
00:21:08,597 --> 00:21:10,526
那个孩子的画像或者别的什么吗
us like a picture of the kid or something?

351
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,446
你以为那里能有几个孩子
How many kids you reckon they got up there?

352
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,696
我的意思是 他们不是在开日托中心
I mean, they ain't running a day-care centre.

353
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,533
- 好的   - 是啊
- OK. - Yeah.

354
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,996
如果我们到那了以后发现Rob是个婴儿呢
What if we get there and Rob's a baby?

355
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:26,045
呃 如果他是婴儿 他们就会留下婴儿的垃圾
Well, if he's a baby, they got baby junk up there.

356
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:26,751
哦 那很有才   
Oh, that's smart.

357
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,258
我是说 他们不可能
I mean, it's not like they're riding around

358
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,295
带着个放在鞋盒子里的婴儿跑了 
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing.

359
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,858
我是说 拜托
I mean, come on.

360
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:33,438
除了那个 留在
Besides that, the bullet

361
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,311
Celeste肚子上的子弹的痕迹
scars didn't look too fresh

362
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:36,057
看起来也不太新鲜了
on Celeste's belly.

363
00:21:36,217 --> 00:21:37,772
- 你说的对  你说得对   - 是啊
- You're right. You're right. - Yeah.

364
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:48,343
如果不止一个孩子呢
What if there's more than one kid?

365
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:49,195
你干嘛问我这么多
Why are you asking me so many

366
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:52,205
该死的问题 伙计 我们能不谈这个了吗
goddamn questions, man? We just went over this! What?

367
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,366
你想知道什么  你到底想知道什么
What do you want to know?! What do you want to know?!

368
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:56,098
我们怎么知道哪个是Rob   
How will we know which is Rob?

369
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:57,959
我会去问哪个是Rob
I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

370
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,195
这个怎么样 我会说
How about that? I'm gonna say,

371
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:00,454
"你知道什么 我不想要Kevin
"You know what, I don't want Kevin!

372
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,148
我不想要Michael 
I don't want Michael!

373
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:02,506
不 我不想要Stephen"
No, I don't want Stephen!"

374
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:03,477
如果周围有
If there's a bunch of

375
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:05,298
一堆该死的孩子 我就会说 我想要Rob
fucking kids around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!

376
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,010
怎么样 他妈的 伙计
How about that? Fucking hell, man!

377
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,258
这是一个该死的简单的入侵和掠夺
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

378
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:13,804
谁在我们面前我们就弄死谁 然后带走Rob
We smash whoever's in front of us and we take Rob!

379
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:15,858
该死的 简单又清晰  
Damn! Plain and simple!

380
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:18,521
什么  抱歉 Lincoln
What? Sorry, Lincoln.

381
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:20,100
我不知道你为什么鬼叫鬼叫的
I don't know why you have to yell...

382
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:21,481
我的娘娘腔兄弟是不会闭嘴的
Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

383
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:23,981
我很好奇 你知道的
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

384
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:26,827
你从哪儿学到这个词的 好奇?
Where'd you learn that word? Inquisitive?

385
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:28,211
你他妈从哪儿学来的   
Where the fuck did you pick that up?

386
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:31,159
就在我的字典里 伙计
It's in my lexicon, man!

387
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,243
- 蠢货 对么   - 它就在我的脑海里
- Jackass. Yeah? - I've got it up here.

388
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:34,878
你们不了解我的地方可多了
There's a lot you don't know about me.

389
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,077
你准备好方便的时间了吗
Are you ready for a potty break?

390
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:37,750
你又读过多少书 操他妈的
How many books you read, motherfucker?

391
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:51,998
我们在哪儿   
Where are we?

392
00:22:52,642 --> 00:22:54,682
我们在Crockett
We're in Crockett.

393
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:59,106
Davy Crockett  几点了
Davy Crockett. What time is it?

394
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:01,321
4点了
Four.

395
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:07,493
嘿
Hey.

396
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:13,288
额... 我猜每个皮纳塔里都有一个小糖果
Hm... I guess there's a little candy in every pinata.

397
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:02,177
有免费的呦
Got some free shit!

398
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:05,851
放轻松 Van Damme  嘿
Take it easy, Van Damme! Hey.

399
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:06,883
Hadji在前台说
Hadji at the front desk said

400
00:24:07,036 --> 00:24:08,644
我们离Austin只有几个小时的距离
we're only a few hours from Austin.

401
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:11,308
很好
Nice!

402
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:19,489
- 谁   - 该死  你觉得还有谁
- Who that? - Fuck. Who do you think?

403
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:22,118
别接电话 伙计
Don't answer that shit, man!

404
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:25,493
别接 你怎么...
Don't answer it. Don't you...

405
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:27,709
- 嘿   - 嘿?
- Hey. - Hey?

406
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:31,130
别跟我打招呼  你在哪里
Don't hey me. The hell are you?

407
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:32,712
德克萨斯
Texas.

408
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,676
德克萨斯?
Texas?

409
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,669
你他妈怎么

就在这途中
It's on the way!

415
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,142
我有份工作要到这儿

416
00:24:45,303 --> 00:24:48,482
哦 你找到工作了 好吧 原谅我
Oh, you took a job! Well, excuse me.

417
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,490
我之前在想什么 我忘了
What was I thinking? I forgot

418
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:51,297
你们是自由职业的艺术家

Oh, you're going to handle it like you handled me yesterday?

424
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:01,220
你们没能检查一次
It's bad enough

425
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:02,698
那个该死的地址已经够糟的了
you can't check a damn address,

426
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:05,166
你们居然还把那些猪肉搁在我的后院里?
but you also got to lay them pork chops out in my backyard?

427
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:06,998
- 计在我们的账上好了   - 那是什么
- Put it on our tab. - What was that?

428
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:10,009
- 没什么   - 注意你说的话 孩子

这不是开玩笑  
This ain't a joke.

430
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:13,463
这个小过失对我来说将会很痛苦
This little misstep is gonna be a pain for me,

431
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:14,447
但是对你来说

432
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:15,632
你可能已经他妈的捅了马蜂窝了
may have just stuck your dick in a hornet's nest.

433
00:25:15,795 --> 00:25:17,386
你在说什么 你什么意思
What are you talking about? What do you mean?

434
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:19,470
有一个ATF的探员找上我了
I've got some jackleg ATF agent up my ass,

435
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,721
指望找个罪名把你们关起来
looking to make a name for locking up you idiots.

436
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:23,165
我最不希望看到的就是
The last thing I need is for

437
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,314
你们这群白痴又在引起不必要的注意
you dumb shits to draw more unneeded attention.

438
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:27,087
我认真的 Brick 我最好
I mean it, Brick. I better

439
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:29,697
不要听到你在德克萨斯那个白痴工作的事
not hear shit about your little Texas job.

440
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:31,146
保持你的屁股不要触电
Keep your ass off the grid.

441
00:25:31,313 --> 00:25:33,282
不要打我家里的电话  把这个号码记下来
Don't call my house. Write this number down.

442
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,202
而且看在上帝的份上 丢掉那该死的手机
And for the love of God, get rid of that damn cell phone.

443
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:41,961
- 是的 先生   - 最好这样 
- Yes, sir. - Damn well better.

You mess around and fuck up my pension, that's your ass.

445
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,308

446
00:25:58,468 --> 00:26:00,972

伙计 别因为你被骂了就把气出在我身上
Man! Don't take it out on me because you got your ass chewed.

454
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:32,594
我们有活干了 男孩子们
We got work to do, boys.

455

就没有人知道如何使用策略了么
Doesn't anybody know how to use finesse any more?

476
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:57,769
你还好么
You all right?

477
00:27:57,934 --> 00:27:59,368
头盔他妈的不太适合   
The helmet ain't work for shit.

478

My bad, lady. You OK?

483
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,040

In my defence, you do work for an asshole.

484
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:05,478

It looks like a fucking bomb went off.

493
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:53,988
Denny?

494
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:57,327

OK, Marty, I know it's over a year ago,

502
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,930
但是我需要你想想 好吗  
but I need you to fucking think, OK?

503
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,676
你确实杀了Celeste 对不对
You did kill Celeste, right?

504
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,485
你不会骗我吧 你会吗
You wouldn't lie to me about that shit, would you?

505
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,004
我把三颗子弹射入了她的内脏  
I put three bullets in her gut.

506
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:32,908
她看起来死了
She looked dead to me.

507
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:35,699
但是你没检查她是否真的死了 你没有吧
But you didn't check to see if she was dead, did you?

508
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:38,500
应该是没有
Guess not.

509
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:41,788
那可是我们的金票啊 我操你妈
That was our golden ticket, you stinking fuck!

How am I going to pay for this? You got the dough?

511

You got a fucking piggy bank in your fat ass?

512
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:52,140

我想这才是重要的 不是吗
I guess that's all that matters, isn't it?

515
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:57,932

你还想去看看那辆车吗
You still want to go look at that car?

520
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,754
那个Carlos让你变残废了?
That Carlos man make you cripple?

521
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,178
嗨 伙计
Hi, buddy.

522
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,770
我不认为他能说话
I don't think he can talk.

523
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:39,316
- 嗯 不会这么惨吧 伙计   - 什么
- Well, ain't this some shit, man. - What?

524

- 别那么做   - 什么
- Don't do that shit! - What?

526
00:31:45,605 --> 00:31:48,025
因为你太刻薄了 他不会受得了的
'Cause you're being mean! He can't help it.

527
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:51,119
你还好吧
You OK?

528
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,618
你受伤了吗
You hurt?

529
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:57,117
你没事吧  他能听的懂我们
You OK? He can understand us.

530
00:31:57,284 --> 00:32:00,749
你是怎么明白他的意思是"我很好"的?
How the hell did you get "I'm OK" From that?

531
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:05,326
嘿 听着 伙计  我们不会伤害你
Hey, look, buddy. We ain't going to hurt you,

532
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:06,972
好么 Celeste让我们来的

533
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:10,184
你知道Celeste吗
You know Celeste?

534
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,434

Yeah! There he goes! See? He understands us just fine.

535
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:20,062
再说一次 你怎么知道他的意思是什么
Once again, how the hell do you know what he's saying?

536
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:21,734
你是温情大姐姐吗
You the tard whisperer?

537
00:32:21,895 --> 00:32:23,236
你再说一遍 我就杀了你
You say that again, I'm gonna kill you.

538
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:24,526
我没在戏弄他 我就是说说
I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.

539
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,568
再说一遍 你就是在戏弄他
Say it again. You are making fun.

540
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:27,324
我真没在戏弄他 我只是说说的
I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.

541
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:28,498
你就在戏弄他
You are making fun of him.

542
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:29,711
只是有点奇怪
It's just a little weird

543
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:31,785
她没有提到这个可怜的小伙子
that she didn't mention the poor little fella's

544
00:32:31,948 --> 00:32:33,122
已经残废了 你知道么   
all buggered up, you know?

545
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:34,167
它不重要
It don't matter.

546
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:35,237
她让我们来带走Rob 
She sent us to get Rob.

547
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,100
我们已经带走Rob了
We got Rob.

548
00:32:36,494 --> 00:32:37,624
好吗
All right?

549
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:39,906
伙计 你还好吧
You good, buddy?

550
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:44,808
我不是在说风凉话   
I wasn't being mean.

551
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:45,427
你就是在说风凉话
You were being mean!

552
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,345
你把他当做笑柄
You were making fun of him.

553
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,774
上帝保佑  他没法控制这些
Bless his heart. He ain't got no control over that.

554
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,901
他不在客厅里真他妈太好了
It's a damn good thing he wasn't in the living room.

555
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,652
我只是随便说说
I'm just saying.

556
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:12,211
嗯 我们可以那么做
Yeah, we can do that.

557
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:22,264
哦 我们能做到的
Oh, we can get that done.

558
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:23,245
好的 Carlos 
All right, Carlos.

559
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:27,060
我只是还要完成一点小事
I'm just finishing up a little something here.

560
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,252
然后我们就上路
Then we'll get on the road.

561
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:31,770
你难道不担心么 甜心
Don't you worry about a thing, sweetie.

562
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:38,402
抱歉 议员
Excuse me, councilman.

563
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:01,924
什么 他想要洗澡
What? He wanted a bath.

564
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:10,938
另一个准备好了么? 我都没脱光呢
Another one already? I didn't even get off.

565
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,658
为了Carlos   
It's for Carlos.

566
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,063
嗯 这就好多了
Well, that makes it a bit better.

567
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:47,437
不会有比这感觉更好的了 Bill
Doesn't get much better than this, Bill.

568
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,100
要是鱼能像这些恙螨一样
It'd be better than this if

569
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:51,656
赶紧咬钩的话就好了
the fish was biting as well as these chiggers.

570
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:58,739
你要害到我了
You gotta be shitting me.

571
00:34:58,903 --> 00:35:01,240
这就是真正的警察事要处理的事情吗
This is where the real police matters are handled, huh?

572
00:35:01,406 --> 00:35:02,930
哦 你是说动用私人财产? 
Oh, you mean on private property?

573
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:04,622
是啊 有些时候是要
Yeah, sometimes it is.

574
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:06,921
我是Anthony Reese 是ATF特工
Anthony Reese, ATF.

575
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,629
Bill Hawkins 很高兴见到你
Bill Hawkins. Nice to meet you.

576
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,508
Bill是一名州议员 
Bill's a representative for the state.

577
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,507
啊 很高兴见到你 先生
Ah, nice to meet you, sir.

578
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:14,536
Bill 你听说过
Bill, have you heard about

579
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:16,389
在我们这里有个正在进行的调查吗
an investigation going on in our area?

580
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:17,186
不 我没有听说过
No, I haven't.



581
00:35:17,856 --> 00:35:18,580
看来Reese探员
It seems Agent Reese

582
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,981
是上面派来检查我们的工作的
was sent down here to check up on us.

583
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:22,810
鉴于他是常青藤盟校毕业的
Seeing as he's an Ivy League grad,

584
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:25,060
我想 这让他比我们更胜任这份工作
I guess that makes him better at our jobs than we are.

585
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,316
哦 是吗
Oh, is he now?

586
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,663
别这么说 我无意插手你们的工作 
No. I'm not trying to intrude,

587
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:30,534
只是想从旁协助
only assist.

588
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:34,118
警长 我觉得我们一开始就把关系搞砸了
Sheriff, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

589
00:35:34,276 --> 00:35:36,910
我们是一个阵营的 我不想让你觉得
We're on the same team. I don't want it to feel like

590
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:39,207
我侵犯你的地盘 我只是...
I'm infringing on your territory. I just...

591
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,086
我真的觉得那三兄弟跟案情有关
I really think we have something with these Oodies.

592
00:35:41,243 --> 00:35:43,544
我们钓鱼的时候不谈工作的事儿 伙计
We don't talk business when I'm fishing, son.

593
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:46,005
我要抛鱼钩啦 当心鱼钩
When I'm about to cast. Don't get hooked!

594
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:49,397
当然 
We can, however,

595
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:53,098
明天在我办公室 我们可以谈论所有事情
talk all about it tomorrow at my office.

596
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:55,980
看到你们北方佬来到这儿 仗着当局的权威
It don't excite me that some Yankee's come down here

597
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:56,983
在我好朋友面前作威作福 
imposing his authority

598
00:35:57,147 --> 00:35:58,681
可让我高兴不起来啊
on one of my best friends.

599
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:00,971
上次我查的时候
This county has the lowest

600
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:03,061
整个州我们这个县的犯罪率是最低的
crime rate in the state, last time I checked.

601
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:04,613
- 就是   - 我知道你们民主党
- Uh-huh. - I know you Democrats

602
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:06,191
认为我们需要你们的帮助
think we need your help,

603
00:36:06,354 --> 00:36:08,631
但你听好了 我们不需要
but I'm here to tell you that we don't.

604
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:10,910
要在哥伦比亚特区跟你对抗 我可真够倒霉
Bad enough I've gotta fight you in D.C.

605
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:12,618
现在你可以
Now you can just ease your

606
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,124
像你进来那样 从这儿出去
way out of here the same way you eased in.

607
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,294
好让我享受剩下的午后时光
I'd like to enjoy what's left of my afternoon.

608
00:36:22,288 --> 00:36:24,209
那...好吧
Alrighty, then.

609
00:36:26,877 --> 00:36:29,380
你为什么不回家 去你老婆身边待着呢
Why don't you go back home to that wife of yours?

610
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:33,224
她一个人抚养孩子多辛苦啊
It must be hard raising a baby all by herself.

611
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:22,443
你的俱乐部真不错   
Pretty classy joint you've got here

612
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:25,447
谢谢 你的衬衫不错
Thanks. Nice shirt.

613
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:34,128
- 你就是Lucky   - 是的
- You Lucky? - That's right.

614
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,290
我们看看那个
Let's see about that.

615
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,674
嘿 家伙 帮我把后面那该死的关掉好吗
Hey, man, why don't you turn that shit off back there for me?

616
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:39,496
那是Mac 
That's Mac.

617
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,097
他98岁高龄 
He's 98 years old.

618
00:37:41,262 --> 00:37:42,260
我觉得他有权利看一些色情的东西
I think he's earned the right

619
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:44,638
如果他想的话
to watch a little T and A if he wants.

620
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,182
是吗 可他一动不动的
Why? He ain't jerking nothing.

621
00:37:47,342 --> 00:37:48,074
呃 是这样 但是自从
Yeah, well, he's been

622
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:48,631
我开创这家俱乐部以来 
watching that stuff

623
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:49,643
他就一直在看那些玩意儿
since I opened the joint,

624
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:52,650
所以我就让他看咯 这没问题吧
so I'm gonna keep it that way, all right?

625
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:54,775
哦 那这样吧
Well, how about this?

626
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:56,657
我过去那儿
If I go back there, I'm

627
00:37:56,658 --> 00:38:00,106
我就弄死Mac 打碎你的电视 怎样
gonna bust up Mac and your TV. How about that?

628
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:01,886
呃 你不是开玩笑的吧
Yeah, is that a fact?

629
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,818
怎么回事儿   
What the fuck?

630
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:10,081
看到了吗 我这儿有个未成年呢
See, I got a minor with me.

631
00:38:10,242 --> 00:38:13,540
我可不希望他听到那些东西
I'd appreciate it if he wouldn't have to listen to that.

632
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:22,348
嘿 Mac 我要把电视关了 好吧
Hey, Mac, I'm gonna give it a rest for a second, all right?

633
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:25,185
我来找一个朋友 Terry
I'm looking for a friend of mine. Terry.

634
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,350
Macky
Macky?

635
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,566
我要关了电视
I'm gonna give it a rest!

636
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,567
Mac

637
00:38:35,728 --> 00:38:40,070
说话啊 Mac Mac
Say, Mac. Mac?

638
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:43,704
看来Mac终于看够了
It looks like Mac finally had enough.

639
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,998
嘿 伙计
Hey, man.

640
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,750
让我猜猜 这就是你说你会回来的部分
Let me guess. This is the part where you say

641
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,129
我说的对吗
you'll be back. Am I right?

642
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,839
我会回来的
I'll be back.

643
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,390
你看过这个电影吗
You know this movie?

644
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,021
我会回来的
I'll be back.

645
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:29,960
我会回来的
I'll be back.

646
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:37,642
哦 你是不是觉得很神奇啊
Well, ain't you full of surprises?

647
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:01,265
嘿 我是Lucky 嗯
Hey, this is Lucky. Yeah,

648
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,831
听着 帮我叫辆救护车过来 好吗
listen, I need an ambulance down here, OK?

649
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:06,711
Mac好像过世了 好吧
It seems like Mac's passed on, OK?

650
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:14,181
你这儿除了酒吧小吃 没有别的吃的了吗
You got anything to eat back there besides the bar food bullshit?

651
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:15,008
我得去拿   
I have to go get it.

652
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,598
好的 搞点好吃的 伙计
Well, rustle something up, man.

653
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,814
给这孩子弄点东西吃
I need something for the kid,

654
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:21,524

还不知道想喝什么呢
Don't know what we'd like yet.

659
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:59,143
没问题 想到了就告诉我们

665
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:40,904
可以为你买杯饮料吗

我马上回来
I'll be right back.

671
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:02,585
自己想办法
Figure it out.

672
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:10,635
说说你的故事 我会假装在认真听的
What's your story? And I'm gonna pretend I'm listening.

673
00:42:10,801 --> 00:42:12,973
狗娘养的 说什么不想让那孩子看色情片
Damn bullshit! Don't want the kid seeing porn,

674
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:14,852
但是那些小妖精一进来
but when some sweet tail walks in,

675
00:42:14,853 --> 00:42:16,566
他们却忘得一干二净了 不是吗
they forget all about that, right?

676
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:19,771
四年来头一次有几个长相甜美
First time in four years I got some sweet,

677
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:21,732

679
00:42:23,164 --> 00:42:25,326
给那帮公路武士们做他妈的三文治
fucking sandwiches for the Road Warriors?

680
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:26,956

681
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:37,466
嗯...
Hm...

682
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,087
想跳舞吗
Wanna dance?

683
00:42:43,546 --> 00:42:45,516

About damn time.

00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,866
Brick?
Brick?

688
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:08,082
那是个骗子还是同性恋的名字?
Is that the Big Whopper or the Ponytail?

689
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:10,661
对了 Marty跟你问好
By the way, Marty says hi.

690
00:43:10,826 --> 00:43:12,558
是吗 那你告诉Marty "去你妈的
Yeah? Well, tell Marty, "Fuck you.

691
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:14,290
我看你怎么躲过下一颗子弹
" I see you dodged another bullet.

692
00:43:14,455 --> 00:43:15,843
你怎么知道我电话号码的
How'd you get this number?

693
00:43:15,998 --> 00:43:19,547
宝贝 现在我想要的东西 就没有得不到的
These days, baby, I can get just about anything I want to.

694
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:23,722
比如 现在我要开车去拿回我的钱
For instance, right now I'm getting back my paycheque on wheels

695
00:43:23,882 --> 00:43:25,037
从你派出的那堆业余人员手里   
from those amateurs you sent. 

696
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:26,910
你个爱财如命的混蛋
Moneygrubbing piece of shit!

697
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:29,256
我们怎么了 宝贝 
What happened to us, baby? 

698
00:43:29,257 --> 00:43:30,522
我们之前很甜蜜 不是吗
We were good once, weren't we?

699
00:43:30,682 --> 00:43:33,147
去你的 我们从来没有甜蜜过 
Fuck you! We were never good. 

700
00:43:33,148 --> 00:43:34,028
我被你耍了
I got played and that's that.

701
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:35,427
喔 等等 
Whoa. Hang on a second. 

702
00:43:35,428 --> 00:43:38,908
要是真有谁被耍了 那个人是我
Anybody got played, it was me.

703
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:42,032
被你这个婊子耍了
I thought I had a bitch that was down with this shit.

704
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:44,165
你杀了他父母 你个神经病
You killed his parents, you psycho!

705
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,826
还是我带你介入他们的生活的 想想就恶心
And it makes me sick that I brought you into their world!

706
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,211
你不觉得是因为他们看人的眼光太差么
Don't you think they're just a bad judge of character?

707
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:51,374
这又不是我的错 谁让你的朋友太有钱了
It ain't my fault all your friends are richer than shit.

708
00:43:51,538 --> 00:43:53,088
难道你一点也不知道么 
And you know something? 

709
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,921
想来想去 我觉得你是知道的
At the end of the day, I think you knew.

710
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,116
如果我知道 我会
If I knew, I would have

711
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:58,133
在你睡觉的时候烧死你这个窝囊废
lit your gutless ass on fire while you slept!

712
00:43:58,296 --> 00:44:01,309
现在的你 才是我认识的那个易怒的婊子
Now, there's the feisty bitch I know!

713
00:44:01,466 --> 00:44:04,314
我真心希望事情的结果不是这样
I wish it hadn't ended up the way it did.

714
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,384
但是Clyde会怎么做呢 
But what's Clyde gonna do 

715
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:07,317
如果Bonnie发起狂来惹他生气
if Bonnie crosses him and goes soft?

716
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:12,355
再说了 那个狗娘养的要钱干嘛
And besides, what does that son of a bitch need money for?

717
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,935
我是说 一个轮椅能要多少钱
I mean, how much can a wheelchair cost?

718
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:14,989
两三百美元吗
Two or three hundred dollars?

719
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:16,627
你个没良心的混账东西 
You lost, motherfucker! 

720
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:18,106
我会把Rob带回来的 
Rob's coming back with me. 

721
00:44:18,107 --> 00:44:18,779
你看着办吧
Deal with it.

722
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:21,443
哦 小妞 
Now, girlie, 

723
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:24,579
看来你经历一次之后还没学乖
obviously you didn't learn the first time around.

724
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:27,162
我来告诉你这事儿会怎么结束
Let me tell you how this shit's gonna end.

725
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:32,176
我派了一些可怕的女人去解决这件事
I sent some really awful bitches to handle this situation.

726
00:44:32,334 --> 00:44:33,307
现在 一旦她们找到你的同伙
Now, once they track down your fellas,

727
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:35,097
不会是一场血腥屠杀
it's not gonna be a bloodbath.

728
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,518
而是一场性感表演
It's gonna get fucking sexy.

729
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:46,475
把他们一个个 分散开来
They'll single them out, divide them up, then thin the herd.

730
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,989
每个人都会忘乎所以
Each one will have forgotten about everything,

731
00:45:34,153 --> 00:45:36,870
只能看到眼前挑逗他们的陌生女郎
except for the fine piece of strange grinding on them.

732
00:45:56,511 --> 00:45:59,643
然后 毫无预兆 他们就死翘翘了
Then, without warning, their lives will be snuffed out

733
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:01,724
最后那些女人会把Rob送过来
and the girls deliver Rob just

734
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,731
我刚好能为他的18岁生日做好准备
in time for me to plan the boy's 18th birthday.

735
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,817
你本应该老老实实待着的 亲爱的
You should have stayed dead, darling.

736
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:09,040
因为 除非你的名字是耶稣
'Cause unless your name is Jesus,

737
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:11,039
否则根本没必要重返人世
you had no business coming back.

738
00:46:11,194 --> 00:46:13,081
回见
See you soon.

739
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:58,420
怎么不试试我的厉害
Why don't you try a taste of me?

740
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:18,965
哦 你们好啊 大家伙 
Well, hi, big guy. 

741

Here's my boom stick.

742
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:26,704

Well, those girls were the longest relationship I ever had.

746
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,781
你没事吧 伙计
You OK, bud? Huh?

747
00:48:41,236 --> 00:48:43,621

All right, come on. I wanna move. Let's go.

748

Do this shit right. I'm gonna do it all night.

750

我可是花了钱的
I've got to pay to play.

751

五个如花似玉的美人儿来到这儿 
Five girls like that come in there, 

752
00:48:57,784 --> 00:48:59,097
你就得花钱

753
00:49:00,382 --> 00:49:01,675
那些猫咪们可不是免费的

754

00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:09,582
是啊
Yeah.

818
00:52:10,386 --> 00:52:13,399
是啊 我记得是定在今天早上呢
Yeah, I think it was scheduled for early this morning.

819
00:52:13,556 --> 00:52:15,526
真是那样吗
Is that right?

820
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:18,681
那么 我建议你最好阻止他们
Well, I suggest you better stop them.

821
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:19,824
我可以打电话给Walters长官问问情况
I could call Chief Walters,

822
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,089
不过我很确信
but I'm pretty sure ain't

823
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,910
那儿只剩下烟和灰尘了
nothing left out there but smoke and ash.

824
00:52:23,066 --> 00:52:26,615
哦 我感到很抱歉
My! I'm really sorry about that.

825
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:29,413
刚刚听起来好像真有什么事儿呢
It really sounded like you had something there.

826
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:37,249
混蛋 我受够了你这样浪费我的时间
Motherfucker, I'm done with you wasting my time.

827
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:40,050
这可是你自找的
I don't ever remember asking for it.

828
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,381
你现在在做的这些 扮演老好人
This good-old-boy justice thing you got going on,

829
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:45,644
让垃圾去处理垃圾 
letting the trash take out the trash, saving tax dollars

830
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,221
把生活在最底层的人排除在体制外来节省税收
by keeping the bottomfeeders out of the system

831
00:52:48,386 --> 00:52:51,649
好让自己能够整天去钓鱼
so you can just go fishing all day,

832
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:53,895
要知道你是在玩火
that's a slippery slope you're playing on.

833
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:54,918
现在
It's gotten to the point

834
00:52:54,919 --> 00:52:56,563
你不比那些垃圾好到哪儿去 警长
where you're no better than they are, Sheriff.

835
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:00,567
没错 我要是你 我就会格外当心
Yeah, I'd be careful if I was you.

836
00:53:02,736 --> 00:53:06,414
哦 我会慎重考虑你的意见的
Well, I'll take that under advisement.

837
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,960
放屁
Shit.

838
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:44,409
起来
Wake up.

839
00:53:44,574 --> 00:53:46,152
去给Rob弄些吃的 
Go get Rob something to eat. 

840
00:53:46,153 --> 00:53:48,206
我去打电话给Celeste
I'm gonna call Celeste.

841
00:54:07,808 --> 00:54:11,272
噢 找到一顶好帽子 伙计
Ooh... Found the mother lode, boy!

842
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:24,668
我会付钱的 别担心 真是的
I'm gonna pay for it. Don't worry. God.

843
00:54:31,084 --> 00:54:35,391
要知道 伙计 当你在商店打开某样东西
You see, man, when you open up something in the store...

844
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:39,428
你就得付钱
...you have to pay for it.

845
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:47,980
我小的时候没人告诉我
No one taught me that when I was young.

846
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:52,239
我历经艰难才懂得这个道理
I learnt that one the hard way.

847
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,405
从警察那里
From the cops.

848
00:54:58,614 --> 00:55:00,253
怎么了
What?

849
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:05,462
怎么了 伙计
What's wrong, man?

850
00:55:06,206 --> 00:55:08,971
你只是那样扭动 我不知道啥意思
I don't know you mean by all that squirming.

851
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:12,840
帮帮我 伙计 你要什么 嗯 要什么
Help me out, bud. What you need, huh? What you need?

852
00:55:14,633 --> 00:55:16,472
你要小便吗
You got to take a piss?

853
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:21,522
你饿啦 天 你当然是饿了
You're hungry. Goddamn, of course you're hungry!

854
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:26,855
给你弄点吃的吧 好的 我们走
Let's get you something to eat, eh? OK. Let's go.

855
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,944
天哪
Man!

856
00:55:30,692 --> 00:55:33,373
每次和这小男孩说话都像在猜谜
It's like working out a riddle every time talking to this boy.

857
00:55:33,529 --> 00:55:35,747
早上好 美女 那啥
Morning, sunshine! You know,

858
00:55:35,906 --> 00:55:37,074
我不记得我们的交易里面
I don't remember crazy-ass

859
00:55:37,075 --> 00:55:38,872
还包括了那些疯狂的小妖精
biker chicks being involved in our deal.

860
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,266
我也不记得我们的交易里
I don't remember leaving

861
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:42,832
要让Carlos活着 Rob没事吧
Carlos alive in the deal either. Is Rob all right?

862
00:55:42,997 --> 00:55:44,800
操
Fuck!

863
00:55:46,293 --> 00:55:48,263
嗯 他可能被吓得半死 不过他很好
Yeah, he's probably scared half to death, but he's fine.

864
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:49,641
让我跟他谈谈   
Let me talk to him. 

865
00:55:49,642 --> 00:55:50,639
他在里面吃东西
He's inside getting something to eat

866
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:52,518
跟McQueen一起 另外 我们得谈谈
with McQueen. Besides, you and I got something to talk about.

867
00:55:52,675 --> 00:55:54,395
好吧 昨晚究竟是怎么回事
All right? What the hell was that last night?

868
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:55,839
我跟你说过了 Carlos会
I told you, Carlos would

869
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,158
想尽办法把Rob弄回去 
try to get Rob back 

870
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,147
如果你不杀了他的话
if you didn't kill him.

871
00:55:58,306 --> 00:55:59,322
你到底在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

872
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,940
我们杀了那里的所有混蛋
We killed every motherfucker in that place.

873
00:56:01,101 --> 00:56:03,687
很明显你没有 Brick
Well, evidently not, Brick!

874
00:56:03,854 --> 00:56:06,026
好吧 像Carlos那样的家伙
All right. Why would a guy like Carlos, what would he want to do

875
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,611
对Rob那种情况的孩子会有什么企图
with a kid in Rob's condition?

876
00:56:08,776 --> 00:56:09,645
Carlos杀了Rob的父母 
Carlos killed Rob's parents, 

877
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:11,947
而且还瞒着我
and then lied to me about it.

878
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:16,160
这些事难道不该早点告诉我么
That might have been something you wanted to mention.

879
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:18,166
好吧 听着 我很抱歉
All right, look. I'm sorry.

880
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:22,427
Rob满18岁的时候会有一笔信托基金
Rob has a trust that matures when he's 18,

881
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:24,254
和他一起
and as legal guardians,

882
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,305
被托付给法定监护人
we would get him and eventually the money.

883
00:56:27,464 --> 00:56:31,724
你早就该告诉我这些了 操
That too might be something that you wanted to mention! Fuck!

884
00:56:31,886 --> 00:56:34,332
Rob的信托基金下周就可以兑现了
Rob's trust matures next week and...

885
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,643
Carlos会不择手段的
Carlos will do anything to get it.

886
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:39,088
Brick 他现在只有你了   
Brick, you're all he's got. 

887
00:56:39,089 --> 00:56:40,355
好吧  新的方案
All right. New plan.

888
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,162
你在半路跟我们碰头   
You meet us halfway. 

889
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:44,483
好吧 在哪
Fine. Where?

890
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:48,410
密西西比州维克斯堡的大河口野营地
Vicksburg, Mississippi. Big Bayou Campground.

891
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,119
我会尽快到的
I'll be there as soon as I can.

892
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,106
还有如果你敢再骗我
And if you lie to me again,

893
00:56:54,107 --> 00:56:56,874
Carlos会是你这辈子担心的最后一件事
Carlos will be the least of your worries.

894
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,696
我已经杀了五个婊子  
I already dropped five bitches. 

895
00:56:58,697 --> 00:57:00,053
杀第六个眼都不用眨
I won't hesitate to make it six.

896
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:12,442
你可能听过小热狗卷
Now, you may have heard of pig in a blanket,

897
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:15,066
但这货是烤小热狗
but this here is a pig in the sun.

898
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:22,341
你想要把头发搭在胸脯上吗 
You want hair on your chest, now, don't you? 

899
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:23,819
脱衣舞女喜欢这样
Strippers like it.

900
00:57:25,486 --> 00:57:26,911
把餐纸递给我 哥们儿
Hand me a napkin, man.

901
00:57:36,374 --> 00:57:37,667
你还好吗
You all right?

902
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:40,761
别担心
Hey. Don't worry.

903
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:42,518
别担心 哥们儿  
Don't worry, man. 

904
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:45,181
没有什么能伤害Lincoln的
Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

905
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:46,980
他很好
He's OK.

906
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:50,399
...确认与乡下的德克萨斯酒吧
...believed to be responsible for the shooting

907
00:57:50,556 --> 00:57:51,767
枪击案有关
in a rural Texas bar.

908
00:57:51,933 --> 00:57:54,614
他们带着一位残障少年 并确定携带武器
They are travelling with a disabled young man and believed to be

909
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:59,195
且非常危险  如果您发现他们千万不要靠近
armed and dangerous. Do not approach these men if you see them.

910
00:58:08,743 --> 00:58:10,879
有人想要一颗窃笑炸弹吗
Who wants a Snicker bomb, huh?

911
00:58:12,998 --> 00:58:16,131
你以为你能用它拐骗小孩离开这吗
Think you can kidnap some kid and get away with it?

912
00:58:20,506 --> 00:58:23,686
好吧 你要是会数数的话 五个杀手婊子
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math, five whore assassins

913
00:58:23,844 --> 00:58:26,347
还不如三个傻子和一个瘸子吧
can't trump three retards and a fucking cripple.

914
00:58:26,513 --> 00:58:29,099
我是说 照我的估计
I mean, well, according to my calculations,

915
00:58:29,266 --> 00:58:31,354
他们现在应该已经到你的地盘上了
they should be in your area someplace by now.

916
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:33,690
但这是你们的该干的活 不是吗
But that's not my fucking job to figure out, is it?

917
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,868
拦路抢劫不是你们老本行吗
I mean, isn't owning the road your goddamn job?

918
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:39,160
我就是这么想的  好吧
That's what I thought. OK.

919
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:40,427
我不管你怎么做  
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do. 

920
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:41,905
把那小子带回来给我就对了
Just get my boy back.

921
00:58:42,698 --> 00:58:44,086
对 搞定它
Yes! Get it done!

922
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:54,046
- 喂   - 我们搞得一团糟
- Yeah? - We're in a world of shit down here.

923
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:55,931
嗯 然后现在要连我牵扯进来么
Yeah, and now it's spilling over into mine.

924
00:58:56,087 --> 00:58:57,511
听着 我们准备去密西西比州的维克斯堡 
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg, Mississippi. 

925
00:58:57,689 --> 00:58:58,213
行吗
OK?

926
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,529
大河口野营地  我们准备   
Big Bayou Campground. We could... 

927
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,649
停 停 闭嘴
Stop. Stop! Shut up!

928
00:59:02,854 --> 00:59:05,311
快他妈闭嘴  我知道的越少越好
Just shut the fuck up! The less I know, the better.

929
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:06,223
我教过你更聪明的办法吧   
I taught you better than this! 

930
00:59:06,995 --> 00:59:08,231
我只是想
Look, I just thought that if,

931
00:59:08,695 --> 00:59:10,774
你知道 如果我们可以跑进去 然后很快搞定
you know, we could run in and do a quick...

932
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:13,396
别  别想那些有的没有的  
Don't do that! Don't get ideas! 

933
00:59:13,747 --> 00:59:14,826
只要照老子说的做就好
Just do what the fuck I say!

934
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:18,281
照我说的做 事情就一帆风顺 不是吗
Things ran smooth when we did that, didn't it?

935
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,207
我帮你擦屁股 你也得照看好我的
I cleaned up your shit, you took care of mine.

936
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:23,453
我本来能很快搞定这个
I could have handled this hotshot.

937
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:26,205
但现在却曝光了
But now this shit has gone public.

938
00:59:26,372 --> 00:59:29,136
这得怪你们自己瞎干
There's repercussions to working for yourself.

939
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,459
现在你学到教训了吧   
About time you learned that. 

940
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,388
什么意思
Meaning what?

941
00:59:32,545 --> 00:59:36,473
我可不管了 Brick  我得明哲保身
I got to cut ties, Brick. I cleaned up everything on my end

942
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:39,599
所以 从现在起你得靠自己了
So, what you do from now on rests solely on your shoulders.

943
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:43,773
如果你敢回来 我就不得不摆平你们了
If you come back here, I got no choice but to put you down.

944
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:46,566
我得保护我的家人
I got a family to protect.

945
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:54,406
我会确保告诉小伙子们我们又自由了
I'll be sure to let the boys know that we're on our own again.

946
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,575
再说吧 Sheriff
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

947
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:06,133
Brick  我们得走了
Brick! We gots to go!

948
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:08,261
我们要红了
We made the news!

949
01:00:19,597 --> 01:00:22,563
Hood海盗们  走着
Hood Pirates! Mount up!

950
01:00:47,169 --> 01:00:48,807
把这个给我
Give me that!

951
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,064
- 你给Millard打电话吗  - 嗯
- You call Millard?   - Yeah.

952
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:56,596
他怎么说
Well, what did he say?

953
01:00:56,764 --> 01:00:58,437
现确定犯罪嫌疑人是
The suspects in question are believed to be

954
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:01,347
Brick Oodie和他的两兄弟   
Brick Oodie and his two brothers... 

955
01:01:01,348 --> 01:01:01,946
没什么
Nothing.

956
01:01:02,103 --> 01:01:05,401
他们来自亚拉巴马州蒙哥马利的阿特摩地区
They hail from the Atmore area, located in Montgomery, Alabama.

957
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:08,615
他们把你画得像个傻逼  瞧
They drew you to look like a fag. Look at that.

958
01:01:08,777 --> 01:01:11,743
你他妈吃错药了吗 老兄
What the fuck you do that for, man?

959
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,067
操 你干嘛啊 老兄   
What the fuck, man? 

960
01:01:20,068 --> 01:01:20,917
来啊  来啊
Come on! Come on, huh?

961
01:01:21,082 --> 01:01:22,126
- 你是要怎样   - 来啊
- What are you do...? - Come on!

962
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,964
我才不会揍你呢 你这个废柴
I ain't gonna fucking hurt you, you little faggot!

963
01:01:24,128 --> 01:01:26,632
- 住手 老兄   - 来啊 来这儿啊
- Stop, man! - Come on! Come here!

964
01:01:26,797 --> 01:01:28,221
想怎样  你想怎样
Want some? You want some?

965
01:01:28,382 --> 01:01:31,764
- 操   - 你吃错药了啊
- Fuck! - What the devil got into you?

966
01:01:34,973 --> 01:01:36,860
我害死我们了
I fucked us.

967
01:01:38,644 --> 01:01:41,230
你什么意思
How you mean?

968
01:01:41,266 --> 01:01:42,856
呃 我说  
Uh, let's see. 

969
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:46,286
Millard不会再罩我们了
Millard won't have anything to do with us any more

970
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,316
因为他没法摆平
'cause he can't clean up

971
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:49,237
摩托女在酒吧大干后造成的后果
that mess with the biker chicks down at the bar.

972
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:51,448
所以现在我们不能回亚拉巴马了
So now we can't go back to 'Bama.

973
01:01:51,644 --> 01:01:54,934
还有我们在奥斯丁撂倒的那些狗娘养的
And all of them son of bitches we mowed down in Austin?

974
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:56,591
猜猜看我们忘了哪一个   
Guess what we missed. 

975
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:57,785
Carlos
Carlos.

976
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:02,752
而且他也不会罢休的
And he ain't gonna stop neither.

977
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:04,390
他早就开始追着Celeste了
He's already tracked down Celeste.

978
01:02:04,548 --> 01:02:06,002
所以现在我们得带他
So now we gotta get him

979
01:02:06,003 --> 01:02:08,724
直到该死的维克斯堡 这样他们就能消失了
to fucking Vicksburg so they can disappear.

980
01:02:09,846 --> 01:02:11,602
好吧
Well...

981
01:02:11,764 --> 01:02:14,315
船到桥头自然直
This is getting better by the minute.

982
01:02:17,395 --> 01:02:21,537
我喜欢那个小家伙 就像其他人一样
Now, I like that little fella just as much as anybody.

983
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:25,535
但跟我说说吧
But tell me something. Just

984
01:02:25,536 --> 01:02:29,253
给我个理由为什么我们为什么不能抛下他不管
give me one reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

985
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:33,334
他们没得选择
They ain't got no other options.

986
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:35,667
切 我们也没得选择好吧
Hell, we ain't got no other options either.

987
01:02:36,374 --> 01:02:38,968
我的意思是 你瞧我们  
I mean, look at us. 

988
01:02:38,969 --> 01:02:41,346
我们甚至不能照顾好自己
We can't even take care of ourselves.

989
01:02:42,965 --> 01:02:44,057
你有没有想过
Has it ever crossed your mind

990
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:47,599
或许没有我们 他能过得更好
that maybe he stands a better chance without us?

991
01:02:49,973 --> 01:02:51,254
这不一样   
It's just different. 

992
01:02:51,255 --> 01:02:52,393
怎么不一样了
How's this different?

993
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,751
就是不一样   
It's just different! 

994
01:02:53,752 --> 01:02:55,063
怎么操蛋的不一样了
How the fuck is it different?

995
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,070
我有过一个哥哥
We had a brother...

996
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,368
在我记事之前就已经死了
...who passed away before you can even remember.

997
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,742
他的状况和Rob差不多
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

998
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:08,756
他状况糟透了 而且还得坐在轮椅上
He was all buggered up, and he was in a wheelchair.

999
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,234
老爸每天都揍他  
Daddy beat his ass every single day. 

1000
01:03:11,235 --> 01:03:13,301
把他当狗一样对待
Treated him like a dog.

1001
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:18,347
而我却什么也做不了  有不一样吗
And there's nothing we could do about it. Different.

1002
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,951
好吧 不提他了  
Well, he gets a pass. 

1003
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,915
我不知道为什么你什么都没说
I don't understand why you didn't say nothing.

1004
01:03:30,082 --> 01:03:31,590
你怎么从来没跟我们说起过
How come you never said nothing?

1005
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,739
你想要我怎么说
What do you want me to say to you?

1006
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,953
对不起 行了吧
I'm sorry, all right?

1007
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,863
但自从我见到这个小伙子开始
But ever since I've seen this fella,

1008
01:03:39,864 --> 01:03:41,374
我就止不住的想起这件事
I can't stop thinking about it.

1009
01:03:49,998 --> 01:03:51,885
他怎么死的
How'd he die?

1010
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:53,563
他怎么死的   
How'd he die? 

1011
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:56,388
不知道 他就在那 然后死了
I don't know. He was there one day and gone the next.

1012
01:03:58,424 --> 01:04:00,000
我问过老爸一次
I asked Daddy about it one time,

1013
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,019
但他就当放屁一样什么也没听见
but that went over like a fart in church.

1014
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,364
他叫什么
What was his name?

1015
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:20,293
- 他们没给他起名字   - 我操
- They never named him. - Fuck me.

1016
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:47,740
发现那几个狗杂种的了  就在前面
Got them bitches! Dead ahead!

1017
01:04:53,444 --> 01:04:57,751
这次 尽量别伤着那个小兔崽子
And this time, try not to hit the motherfucking baby.

1018
01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:03,418
他们来了
Here they come!

1019
01:05:03,581 --> 01:05:05,966
我给了所有她需要的
I'm giving it all she's got.

1020
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:07,669
Monaco什么也没留下
Monaco ain't got nothing left!

1021
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,471
绑紧Rob  他们来了 小伙子们
Strap in Rob! Here they come, boys!

1022
01:05:09,629 --> 01:05:11,634
我操这些狗杂种要干嘛
What the hell is this motherfucker?

1023
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,170
嘿 Rottweiler  
Hey, Rottweiler! 

1024
01:05:16,171 --> 01:05:17,475
你最好退到后面去 傻逼
You better back the fuck up, mutt!

1025
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:22,521
圣诞快乐 混蛋
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

1026
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:26,989
那孩子在后座上
The kid's in the back!

1027
01:05:49,757 --> 01:05:50,949
他们把孩子带走了  
They took the kid! 

1028
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,142
我说了叫你绑紧他的啊
I thought I told you to strap him in!

1029
01:05:52,302 --> 01:05:53,353
他们把门都给拉走了
They took the fucking door,

1030
01:05:53,354 --> 01:05:55,066
老兄 我现在真的觉得
Man! I really don't think a fucking seatbelt

1031
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:57,107
重点不在安全带  快追啊
would have mattered right now! Go!

1032
01:06:05,482 --> 01:06:07,342
他怎么样了   
Hey, he all right? 

1033
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:08,830
谁他妈知道啊
How in the fuck do I know?

1034
01:06:09,738 --> 01:06:11,291
他们追来了  就像你说的
Here they come! Just like you said!

1035
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:17,004
来副驾驶座这边  你会感兴趣的
Hey! Help the driver. You want to see this.

1036
01:06:17,163 --> 01:06:19,500
看我们怎么操了你的保姆们
We're about to fuck your babysitters up.

1037
01:06:28,926 --> 01:06:31,262
- 来啊 小伙儿   - 来啊
- Come on, boy! - Whoo! Come on!

1038
01:06:33,013 --> 01:06:35,695
欢迎来到南部 狗杂种
Welcome to the South, motherfuckers!

1039
01:06:41,022 --> 01:06:43,870
怎么样啊 狗娘养的
Whoo! What you got now, bitches?!

1040
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,412
没时间了 贱人
Time out, bitch!

1041
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:08,557
不是吧  真是的  不要
No. No, indeed. Hell no.

1042
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,772
想想办法啊 你是军师
Do something, you're the brains!

1043
01:07:09,773 --> 01:07:10,855
我们必须得想想办法
We've gotta figure something out!

1044
01:07:11,014 --> 01:07:12,652
什么
What?!

1045
01:07:14,226 --> 01:07:16,065
- 从顶上   - 从顶上
- Top rope! - Top rope!

1046
01:07:23,153 --> 01:07:25,122
狗日的
Motherfuckers!

1047
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:35,464
干了他们 Lincoln  上啊
Get them, Lincoln! Come on!

1048
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,975
快干了他们
Go get 'em!

1049
01:07:43,133 --> 01:07:46,099
他们减速了  他们减速了
They're slowing down! They're slowing down!

1050
01:07:48,473 --> 01:07:50,027
上
Come on.

1051
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:56,824
Lincoln
Lincoln!

1052
01:08:12,874 --> 01:08:14,595
我们没事
We're good!

1053
01:08:15,837 --> 01:08:17,806
你还好吗 哥们
You all right, buddy?

1054
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:28,769
你真是条汉子
You're one crazy redneck.

1055
01:08:36,026 --> 01:08:37,977
翅膀硬了是吗  
Trying to be a tough guy? Huh? 

1056
01:08:37,978 --> 01:08:40,415
想从我们眼皮底下开溜
Running away from us?

1057
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:45,709
想来一根吗  你应得的
You want one of these? You've earned it.

1058
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:48,954
Linc怎么样了   
How's Linc? 

1059
01:08:48,955 --> 01:08:50,379
不太乐观
Not so good.

1060
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:51,346
什么   
What? 

1061
01:08:51,347 --> 01:08:52,382
你最好去看看他
You better check on him.

1062
01:08:52,544 --> 01:08:54,466
你看好Rob了
You got Rob?

1063
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,688
操
Fuck.

1064
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,984
都是你干的吗
You do all this?

1065
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,074
老天爷干的
By God.

1066
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,954
这可不是你的帽子 贱货
It ain't your hat, bitch.

1067
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:19,914
干得好
Good work!

1068
01:09:20,075 --> 01:09:22,329
让我看看
Let me take a look.

1069
01:09:22,494 --> 01:09:24,499
来吧  让我看看
Come on. Let me see it.

1070
01:09:27,499 --> 01:09:29,837
靠
Shit!

1071
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,306
不夸张地说
Well, I think it's safe to say that, uh,

1072
01:09:33,464 --> 01:09:37,640
这已经远远超过McQueen能处理的范围
that surpasses McQueen's level of doctoring.

1073
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:40,589
- 我很好    - 你不好
- Fine.   - You are not fine.

1074
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,768
我们得检查检查
We need to get that looked at.

1075
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,369
我很好   
Fine. 

1076
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:46,983
好吧  你很好
All right. You're fine.

1077
01:09:48,982 --> 01:09:51,117
好个屁
Fine, my ass.

1078
01:09:55,655 --> 01:09:57,496
操
Fuck!

1079
01:10:08,378 --> 01:10:09,802
McQueen
McQueen!

1080
01:10:22,143 --> 01:10:26,735
Montane  你他妈死哪去了
Montane! Montane, where the fuck are you?

1081
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:31,411
狗屎
Shit.

1082
01:10:40,914 --> 01:10:43,715
操你妈
Goddamn it!

1083
01:10:45,461 --> 01:10:46,754
嘿 要搭你们一程吗
Hey. You guys need a ride?

1084
01:11:00,144 --> 01:11:02,529
他妈的这些人搞什么鬼
Who are these fucking people?!

1085
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,492
不用了 老兄 我们很好  走吧
Nah, man. We're good. Just keep going.

1086
01:11:06,818 --> 01:11:08,906
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

1087
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,218
他制造了这些怪物 
He practically made these monsters, 

1088
01:11:11,219 --> 01:11:13,129
然后把他们晾出来
then hung them out to dry.

1089
01:11:13,284 --> 01:11:15,834
你玩儿我是吧
You gotta be kidding me.

1090
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:19,928
他们为什么没在为老子工作
And why aren't they working for me?!

1091
01:11:22,753 --> 01:11:26,217
快进到车里  我是个护士  我能帮上忙
Just get in the car. I'm a nurse. I can help.

1092
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:27,936
这个主意不错
That ain't such a bad idea.

1093
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:31,558
找到了
Bingo.

1094
01:11:33,098 --> 01:11:35,566
发生什么事了
What happened here?

1095
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:38,197
那个是我干的 
I did that. 

1096
01:11:38,198 --> 01:11:40,066
你指刺伤还是缝合
The stabbing or the stitches?

1097
01:11:40,231 --> 01:11:41,819
缝合   
The stitches. 

1098
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,861
伤口已经感染了
Infection is setting in.

1099
01:11:45,027 --> 01:11:46,749
我淋了威士忌在上面
I poured whiskey on it.

1100
01:11:46,905 --> 01:11:48,827
我猜你是在电影里学的吧
Let me guess, you saw that in a movie?

1101
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,671
是的  大部分
Yeah. Several.

1102
01:12:03,381 --> 01:12:06,230
Rob
Hey-Hey,Rob?

1103
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:07,685
这由你来保管 好吗
You hold onto that, all right?

1104
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:10,050
你知道这是他最珍视的东西
You know that's his prize possession.

1105
01:12:10,142 --> 01:12:12,636
等他好了他会需要的 好吗
He's gonna need it when he gets to feeling better, OK?

1106
01:12:19,274 --> 01:12:19,947
Chogan 我是Carlos  
Chogan, this is Carlos. 

1107
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:22,321
这是我给你下的最后通牒
I'm only calling as a last damn resort.

1108
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:24,469
有几个混蛋绑走了Rob 你给我去做了他们
Some asshole took Rob and I need you to kill him.

1109
01:12:24,642 --> 01:12:25,580
把那小子给我带回来 如果可能的话 
If you can, bring me back the kid, 

1110
01:12:25,785 --> 01:12:26,923
否则就把他们全做了
and if not, then fuck it.

1111
01:12:27,073 --> 01:12:28,519
如果我得不到他 别人也休想
If I can't have him, nobody can.

1112
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,964
他们没走远
They're close.

1113
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,928
走了
Finish up!

1114
01:12:49,474 --> 01:12:51,527
他会好起来吗
He gonna be all right?

1115
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:55,029
我说过 这取决于你
Like I said, it's up to you.

1116
01:13:01,113 --> 01:13:02,915
你看起来很眼熟
You look really familiar.

1117
01:13:03,824 --> 01:13:04,744
- 是吗   - 是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1118
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:06,589
你住过廉价汽车旅馆吧  
Do you stay in shitty motels? 

1119
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:07,648
我是打扫的
'Cause we clean them.

1120
01:13:10,665 --> 01:13:14,343
Crockett  我在那见过你
Crockett. That's where I've seen you.

1121
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:17,557
这世界真小
Small world.

1122
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:21,012
你为什么不去当护士呢
So why ain't you a nurse?

1123
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:24,653
医院不雇用非法移民
Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.

1124
01:13:24,654 --> 01:13:26,479
为什么不是合法的
Why don't you become legal?

1125
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:29,359
你们国家的政策可没那么容易让我们合法
Your country doesn't make it that easy for us.

1126
01:13:29,519 --> 01:13:30,563
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

1127
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:33,363
只要到那填好文件就行了
Just go down to the place and fill out your paperwork.

1128
01:13:34,524 --> 01:13:36,074
告诉他们你想被法律认可就好了
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal.

1129
01:13:36,075 --> 01:13:37,373
我是说 你不是会英语吗
I mean, you speak the language.

1130
01:13:37,528 --> 01:13:40,411
在那每个人都说英语
That's more than most of them do out here.

1131
01:13:40,573 --> 01:13:42,708
你的无知真是难以置信
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

1132
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:47,009
好吧 没错 我只是个无知的硬汉
Yeah, well, I might be just an ignorant redneck,

1133
01:13:47,164 --> 01:13:49,465
但至少我知道自己是什么样的人
but at least I know who I am.

1134
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:53,040
我是说 你是护士  
I mean, you're a nurse. 

1135
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:54,638
你就应该帮助别人
You ought to be helping people.

1136
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:56,933
而不是刷马桶
Not scrubbing toilets.

1137
01:13:57,842 --> 01:14:01,235
这就是为什么你那么随心所欲吗  
Well, is that why you do what you do? 

1138
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,932
因为你是这样的人
'Cause it's who you are?

1139
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:09,316
我们就当是一家人在聊天吧
Let's just say it runs in the family. You know?

1140
01:14:10,731 --> 01:14:14,244
走上这一步你就别想有什么家人了
Well, you're not gonna have much family left at this pace.

1141
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:25,133
听着 我真的很感激你为我们所做的一切
Listen, I really appreciate everything you've done for us.

1142
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:28,469
我不能保证我能报答你 所以
I can't say that I'd exactly done the same thing, so...

1143
01:14:30,796 --> 01:14:32,599
不客气
You're welcome.

1144
01:14:34,592 --> 01:14:38,851
如果 如果我说付你两千美元
What would you say if... if I offered you two grand

1145
01:14:39,013 --> 01:14:40,604
送我们到密西西比州的维克斯堡 你怎么说
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi?

1146
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:48,822
如果我要说服你别去做你将要去做的事呢
What do you say I convince you not to do what you're about to do?

1147
01:14:50,735 --> 01:14:53,285
我能带你去任何别的地方
I could take you anywhere else.

1148
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:59,080
算了 我们必须去那里把事情解决 知道吗 
Nah. This here's one of them kind of deals, you know?

1149
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,605
我们生命里的大部分时间
We kind of had people

1150
01:15:03,606 --> 01:15:07,260
都由别人在掌控 你知道吗
controlling what we do our whole lives, you know?

1151
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,598
是时候让我们自己来掌握命运了
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

1152
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:00,840
照顾好那孩子   
Please keep the kid safe for me. 

1153
01:16:02,753 --> 01:16:03,530
不会再出事了
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

1154
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,935
不过我们得先把事情做个了结   
We've just got a job to finish. 

1155
01:16:06,343 --> 01:16:07,722
我是外来的 但是我不傻啊
I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

1156
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:16,039
- 谢谢你   - 再见
- Thank you. - See ya.

1157
01:16:18,081 --> 01:16:19,173
再见
See you around.

1158
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:31,517
我们还能用三千块钱填满个池塘吗
Can we still put a pool in with three grand?

1159
01:16:34,141 --> 01:16:36,229
你在想什么啊
What you thinking?

1160
01:16:39,773 --> 01:16:41,659
在想打地鼠游戏啊
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

1161
01:16:41,817 --> 01:16:43,738
以后就两个人的话 情况会有点棘手啊
But it's gonna be tough with just two of us.

1162
01:16:46,196 --> 01:16:48,333
什么叫就两个人了
What you mean two?

1163
01:16:56,332 --> 01:16:57,377
这个正好
That's fitting.

1164
01:17:03,591 --> 01:17:06,095
- 想不想我再推高点   - 不用了
- You want to go high?  - No.

1165
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,200
去吧 你跑回家去
You go and run in the house.

1166
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:23,782
不管听到什么 
No matter what you hear, 

1167
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:24,337
也不管别人怎么说
no matter what the people say,

1168
01:17:25,543 --> 01:17:26,567
爸爸做的 只是在尽我所能
Papaw did what he could to

1169
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:27,897
为你创造更好的生活  明白吗
make things better for you than he had. OK?

1170
01:17:30,817 --> 01:17:31,553
去吧  跑过去
Go. Run along.

1171
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:43,935
派遣员说你在这儿
Dispatch told me you'd, uh... you'd be here.

1172
01:17:44,095 --> 01:17:45,841
是吗 我倒很想给你倒杯茶
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea,

1173
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:46,604
不过我习惯喝超浓的那种 都能杀死一头驴
but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

1174
01:17:47,236 --> 01:17:48,457
你大概会接受不了
It might be too strong for you.

1175
01:17:52,311 --> 01:17:57,357
你猜在所有南方人的习惯和优点中
You know, of all the Southern idioms and charms,

1176
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:01,181
我觉得哪个最有价值
you know which one I find the most helpful?

1177
01:18:02,146 --> 01:18:03,581
似火的热情吗
My extraordinary hospitality?

1178
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:08,523
大家把什么东西都留着
The fact that nobody ever throws anything away.

1179
01:18:11,702 --> 01:18:12,498
警长 我得把这个给你 
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

1180
01:18:14,377 --> 01:18:15,176
没有任何资料显示
There was nothing in any

1181
01:18:15,347 --> 01:18:18,754
你跟他们有关系
database that ever connected you to them.

1182
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:22,994
白天又没有收到电脑档案
Wasn't no computer files back in the day.

1183
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:26,098
阿拉巴马州的却已经过时了
Another perk of Alabama being behind the times.

1184
01:18:26,918 --> 01:18:28,938
书面记录太容易弄丢了
Paper trail easy as hell to get rid of.

1185
01:18:29,927 --> 01:18:32,842
所以这只能代表一件事 负责的是个黄毛小子
Only thing this proves is that a young deputy was doing his job.

1186
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:36,635
对对对 我就知道你会这么说
Right, right, right. Well, I figured you'd say that,

1187
01:18:36,805 --> 01:18:38,955
所以我仔细研究了 
so I did a little further digging, 

1188
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,380
然后找到了这个
and I found this.

1189
01:18:42,368 --> 01:18:44,692
Henry 你漏掉了一些文件
You missed some paper, Henry.

1190
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:50,126
05年5月26日 你签了1200美元账单
You signed for $1,200 dollars on May 26th, '05,

1191
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:52,854
07年6月15日 800美元
$800 June 15th, '07

1192
01:18:53,277 --> 01:18:55,951
08年2月3日 1100美元
$1,100 on February 3rd, '08.

1193
01:18:56,213 --> 01:18:57,836
后面诸如此类
And it goes on and on and on.

1194
01:18:58,528 --> 01:19:01,014
那些钱是用来清理犯罪现场的
That money was issued for crime scene clean up.

1195
01:19:01,196 --> 01:19:03,303
我乐意雇谁做这事就雇谁
And I can hire anybody I damn well please.

1196
01:19:05,043 --> 01:19:05,932
是吗 案件还没发生
Well, since when do people

1197
01:19:06,096 --> 01:19:08,876
怎么就能清理现场了
get paid to clean up a crime before it happens?

1198
01:19:13,202 --> 01:19:14,829
警长 你确实是对的
You are right though, Sheriff.

1199
01:19:15,629 --> 01:19:18,338
你把犯罪率控制在全国最低
You've got the lowest crime rate in the state.

1200
01:19:20,282 --> 01:19:22,356
所以你也就不用给他们太多钱了吧
You certainly weren't paying them much though, were you?

1201
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:25,447
难怪那些小崽子们都来找你
It's no wonder those dogs turned on you.

1202
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:31,893
这样吧  这件事可以有两个结果
Now, listen. This story, you know, could end one of two ways.

1203
01:19:33,213 --> 01:19:35,672
要么 你帮我解决这事 跟我合作
You could either help me out, cooperate...

1204
01:19:36,874 --> 01:19:38,576
要么 我现在就逮捕你
...or I could just arrest you on the spot.

1205
01:19:39,384 --> 01:19:40,776
然后我自己把他们一网打尽
Take them down myself, eventually.

1206
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,860
不管是哪个法子 我都得把你送进监狱
Look, either way, I've got to take you to prison,

1207
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:46,274
但你要是表现良好
but you play nice,

1208
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,698
你吃牢饭的日子就可以减少点
I'll see to it that your sentence is shortened.

1209
01:19:50,984 --> 01:19:52,343
搞不好你还会有机会
Maybe one day you'll be able to

1210
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,453
看到你孙女从高中毕业呢
see your granddaughter graduate from high school.

1211
01:20:08,881 --> 01:20:11,562
我这可是出于职业的好意
Let's consider it a professional courtesy.

1212
01:20:13,469 --> 01:20:15,723
他们很快就会报复你的
They get big quick on you.

1213
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:19,567
你迟早会知道的
You'll find that out sooner or later.

1214
01:20:26,316 --> 01:20:28,868
- 跟我来   - 别 别这样
- Come with me. - No, no, no. Come on.

1215
01:20:29,028 --> 01:20:31,330
- 这样可不好   - 你省省吧
- I don't think so. - Cut that shit out.

1216
01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:33,826
反抗是小孩子玩的把戏
Fighting's a young man's game.

1217
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:41,595
- 那你要去哪里   - 维克斯堡
- Where are you going, huh? - Vicksburg.

1218
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,179
这件事必须要我亲自了结
If anybody's gonna put an end to this, it's going to be me.

1219
01:20:47,382 --> 01:20:50,479
我才是有理由不相信你的人
You know, I'm the one that ain't supposed to be trusting you.

1220
01:20:50,635 --> 01:20:52,854
但是你赢了
Y'all won the damn war.

1221
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:02,580
Lincoln以前摔跤的时候
Now this is the same face

1222
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:05,204
就会在脸上画这个
paint that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

1223
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,578
这样你跟我们就是一家人了
Solidifies you as one of us.

1224
01:21:14,074 --> 01:21:15,432
害怕吗
You scared?

1225
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:19,003
现在你是Oodie家的一份子了   
You're an Oodie now. 

1226
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:20,645
你得克服恐惧
You got to swallow that fear.

1227
01:21:28,346 --> 01:21:29,086
不过不管如何
For what it's worth,

1228
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,593
你承受过太多 该得到更好的回报
I think you deserve more than what you've been through.

1229
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:38,263
这不公平 就因为你不能自理
It ain't right, people taking advantage of you

1230
01:21:38,402 --> 01:21:40,270
他们都利用你
just because you can't help yourself.

1231
01:21:43,605 --> 01:21:45,054
我知道在你的一生当中
I know you may not have had a

1232
01:21:45,246 --> 01:21:47,596
可能不会出现多少值得尊敬的人
lot of people in your life you can look up to.

1233
01:21:49,075 --> 01:21:53,431
该死的 我不是要你尊敬我们
Hell, I ain't telling you to look up to us.

1234
01:21:58,063 --> 01:21:59,181
我只是想让你知道 
I just want you to know that 

1235
01:22:00,126 --> 01:22:01,711
我们会尽我们所能
we're going to do everything we can

1236
01:22:01,879 --> 01:22:03,223
护你周全
to keep you from getting hurt.

1237
01:22:12,339 --> 01:22:13,751
这个给你
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

1238
01:22:16,303 --> 01:22:17,405
这是我的新装备
My new lookout.

1239
01:22:24,235 --> 01:22:25,574
你已经有了很大进步
You've been promoted.

1240
01:22:50,602 --> 01:22:52,275
空的
Empty-

1241
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,397
这不够   
That ain't much. 

1242
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:07,421
形势所迫
It's gonna have to do.

1243
01:23:15,171 --> 01:23:16,844
Lincoln情况不大妙
Lincoln don't look so good.

1244
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:21,806
谁说的 他好多了
Yeah, he's been better.

1245
01:23:25,975 --> 01:23:30,485
你觉得她会不会过来查看这件事
You think she's gonna come and see this thing through?

1246
01:23:30,647 --> 01:23:32,487
还是跑得远远的
Or is she just gonna run for the hills?

1247
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:36,077
这个到时候我们就会知道了
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

1248
01:23:37,237 --> 01:23:39,077
是啊
Yeah.

1249
01:23:45,038 --> 01:23:50,009
你觉得上帝为什么要创造他那样的人
Why you reckon God would make someone like him?

1250
01:23:52,171 --> 01:23:53,725
什么
What?

1251
01:23:54,673 --> 01:23:58,305
上帝为什么要让那么残忍的事发生在他身上
Why would God let something be wrong with him like that?

1252
01:24:04,184 --> 01:24:08,326
不知道  见鬼 我怎么会知道
I don't know. Hell, man, I don't know.

1253
01:24:12,485 --> 01:24:15,202
该死的 干嘛要问我这个
Hell, why you asking me that, man?

1254
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:20,001
不知道  只是好奇
I don't know. Just been thinking about it.

1255
01:24:22,955 --> 01:24:26,171
我不好奇上帝为什么要创造他那样的人
I don't ask why God made men like him.

1256
01:24:28,753 --> 01:24:31,518
我好奇上帝为什么要创造我们这样的人
I wonder why he made men like us.

1257
01:25:06,212 --> 01:25:07,505
他们怎么样
How are the boys?

1258
01:25:11,259 --> 01:25:13,728
好吧
All right.

1259
01:25:16,014 --> 01:25:17,854
- 喂 Brick   - 怎么了
- Hey, Brick? - Hm?

1260
01:25:19,309 --> 01:25:21,232
我觉得我们当初应该把书念完的
I'm starting to think we should have finished school.

1261
01:25:24,107 --> 01:25:25,660
好歹我们也把初中念完了
At least junior high.

1262
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:49,011
马上就会结束了
It's almost over, bud.

1263
01:26:10,825 --> 01:26:13,210
- 该死的   - McQueen
- Oh, shit! - McQueen!

1264
01:26:16,499 --> 01:26:18,800
操他妈的箭  该死的
A fucking arrow, man? Fuck!

1265
01:26:32,683 --> 01:26:34,274
快

1266
01:26:37,897 --> 01:26:39,322

跑啊
Move your ass, woman!

1268
01:26:50,647 --> 01:26:51,195
该死   
Shit. 

1269
01:26:51,632 --> 01:26:52,784
Brick Rob在哪里
Where's Rob, Brick?

1270
01:26:52,953 --> 01:26:53,706
他没事
He's safe!

1271
01:26:57,970 --> 01:26:59,218
在这儿别动  
Stay right here. 

1272
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:00,140
我得去补充点儿弹药
I've gotta go get some ammo.

1273
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:01,341
- 不行 我跟你一起去  - 你待在这儿
- No! I'm going with you.   - Stay here!

1274
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:03,892
- 我要跟你一起去   - 操
- I'm going with you! - Fuck!

1275
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:05,856
- 快啊   - 走
- Come on, man! - Go!

1276
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:15,586
该死的 拿把枪   
Grab a gun. Fuck. 

1277
01:27:15,587 --> 01:27:17,359
快他妈带我去找Rob
Take me to fucking Rob!

1278
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:18,949
你给我老实待在这儿
You're keeping your ass here!

1279
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:22,865
有箭 我操
That was a fucking arrow, man!

1280
01:27:26,326 --> 01:27:28,546
Brick
Brick!

1281
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,504
Brick
Brick!

1282
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:38,767
混蛋 这一点也不好玩  给我住手
Time out, motherfucker! This ain't fun no more! Stop!

1283
01:27:39,925 --> 01:27:43,187
该死的 见鬼
Fuck me! Oh, shit.

1284
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:06,419
我他妈不是叫你待这儿的吗
I told you to fucking stay here!

1285
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:07,707
不准说什么早告诉你了之类的话
You're really gonna say I told you so right now?

1286
01:28:07,873 --> 01:28:09,296
你管好你自己的事吧
You mind yourself, woman!

1287
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:11,842
该死的
Shit!

1288
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:19,389
我的天
God!

1289
01:28:24,016 --> 01:28:25,838
不准再动了   
Don't fucking move! 

1290
01:28:25,839 --> 01:28:27,480
出来吧 出来呀
Come out, come out.

1291
01:28:29,605 --> 01:28:31,277
你拿那个干嘛啊
What you gonna do with that, huh?

1292
01:28:33,526 --> 01:28:35,578
- McQueen   - 当心
- McQueen! - Hey!

1293
01:28:55,592 --> 01:28:57,977
John Redcorn 你今天走霉运了
You're about to have a bad day, John Redcorn.

1294
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,952
现在是谁在走霉运啊
Remind me again who's gonna have a bad day?

1295
01:29:38,724 --> 01:29:40,943
真是稀奇
Ain't that a sight.

1296
01:30:34,911 --> 01:30:35,449
也就是说 
So, uh... 

1297
01:30:36,606 --> 01:30:38,439
你和你哥哥们绑架了这个孩子
you and your brothers kidnapped the kid from, uh...

1298
01:30:38,555 --> 01:30:39,482
这孩子是Martin女士的吧
...from Ms Martin, and

1299
01:30:39,669 --> 01:30:41,579
你们是不是打算借此索要赎金
you were planning on holding him for ransom?

1300
01:30:41,749 --> 01:30:42,439
是不是   
Yeah? All right. 

1301
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:45,102
没错
That's what I said.

1302
01:30:45,665 --> 01:30:48,965
那其他的那些人呢 他们是什么人
And what about these other men here? Who are they? Huh?

1303
01:30:54,703 --> 01:30:58,270
- 啊   - 好吧 算了
- Oh... - All right. All right.

1304
01:30:58,465 --> 01:30:59,295
反正以后再监狱里
You'll have plenty of time

1305
01:30:59,591 --> 01:31:01,087
有的是时间思考答案
to think about your answers in prison. Yeah?

1306
01:31:12,203 --> 01:31:13,550
你是Reese特工吗   
Agent Reese? 

1307
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:15,168
你是特工Simmons吧 幸会啊
Special Agent Simmons! Hey!

1308
01:31:15,331 --> 01:31:16,399
干得不错   
Nice work. 

1309

谢谢夸奖 长官
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1310

你处理这片地方的动力让我深感佩服
I'm very impressed with how you navigated these waters.

1311

I'm putting in a request to have you take over this territory.

1312
01:31:23,465 --> 01:31:25,051

Don't worry about the details.

1314

我们会帮你处理好的
We'll get everything handled.

1315

但是我的妻子   
But my wife... 

1317

这个地方很养人啊
It's a fine place to raise a family.

1318
01:31:31,432 --> 01:31:32,410
长官 我   
Sir... I... 

1319
01:31:32,411 --> 01:31:34,150
我敢保证 她一定会喜欢这里的
I'm sure she'll love it.

1320
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:38,367
不是吧 我操
Oh... fuck me.

1321
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:41,703

Hey! Fuck me!

1322
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:48,836
喂 老兄
Hey, bud!

我是来跟你说谢谢的
I just wanted to say thank you.

1324
01:31:51,428 --> 01:31:53,423
事情变成这样我很抱歉
I'm sorry it came down to all this.

1325
01:31:53,583 --> 01:31:56,430
没关系
Don't mention it.

1326
01:31:57,753 --> 01:32:00,637
只要把这小家伙照顾好就行了
Just make sure you take care of this little guy.

1327
01:32:01,799 --> 01:32:04,019
他可是很难缠的啊
He's one tough cuss.

1328
01:32:07,347 --> 01:32:09,933
我们没干掉那混蛋 对不起啊
Sorry we didn't get the fucker.

1329
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,569
没关系的  Carlos难逃一劫
That's all right. Carlos will get his.

1330
01:32:16,733 --> 01:32:20,699
那个 老兄 我能不能跟他单独相处一会儿 
Hey, man, you think I could have a minute? 

1331
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,286
我哪儿也不会去的
I ain't going nowhere.

1332
01:32:22,448 --> 01:32:24,204
好吧
All right.

1333
01:32:26,077 --> 01:32:29,375
别哪样
Hey, stop that.

1334
01:32:38,382 --> 01:32:41,894
要继承我们的优良传统哦
Make sure this shit didn't go down for nothing.

1335

谢谢
Thank you.

1336
01:32:54,566 --> 01:32:57,914

Well, ain't that some E.T. Shit?

1337
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:03,499
你也知道Brick很别扭的 对吧
You know Brick's gay, right?

1338
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,671
Rob 再见
See ya, Rob.

1339
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:21,358
真是一波未平一波又起
The hits just keep on coming.

1340
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:32,287
不过不管结果如何
No matter how this thing plays out...

1341
01:33:34,945 --> 01:33:37,033
我为你们感到骄傲
...I'm proud of you boys.

1342

Is there anything I can get you?

1344
01:33:57,430 --> 01:33:58,111

1348
01:34:02,197 --> 01:34:02,898
包裹给我   
Just give me the package. 

1349
01:34:02,899 --> 01:34:03,480
你还好吧 先生
Are you all right, sir?

1350
01:34:03,559 --> 01:34:05,236
我好得很  不关你的事
Yeah, I'm fine. It's none of your goddamn business.

1351
01:34:05,536 --> 01:34:06,281
你得签字啊   
You have to sign. 

1352
01:34:07,526 --> 01:34:08,114
是不是很有意思
Isn't that great?

1353
01:34:08,402 --> 01:34:09,260
现在该死的邮递员
The fucking Postal Service

1354
01:34:09,448 --> 01:34:11,558
关系到我的安宁了

1355
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,347
这最好是一整盒现金
This better be a box full of fucking cash.

1356
01:34:32,843 --> 01:34:34,598
操你妈的
You bitch!
