这是一个很好的目标

都是在同一条路上的交叉路口吗？

这样会危及逃生路线

试着回忆那九月的

当草是绿色的......

醒醒吧，亲爱的 告别你的父亲

God, I got to work on that acronym.

An extremely costly method, of hijacking the hippocampus

138
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,730
去清除旧时的创伤记忆

139
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,410
但是它不会改变我们父母没有成功到达机场
It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport,

140
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,000
还有我做出的那些逃避悲痛的事情
or the things I did to avoid processing my grief.

141
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,620
另外，我已经投入了6.11亿美元在这个心理治疗的小实验
Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment.

142
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,230
在这世界上没有一个正常人会资助这个项目
No one in the right mind would ever funded it.

143
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,850
问你们一下，记得什么是MIT的办学宗旨吗？
Help me out. What's the MIT admission statement.

144
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,490
要生成，传播和保护知识，
To generate, disseminate and preserve knowledge,

145
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,170
并与他人合作，
and work with others,

146
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,400
把解决全球的巨大挑战
to bring to bear on the world's great challenges.

147
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,790
那么，你或其他人
Well, you, or the others.

148
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,270
虽然前方困难重重
And quite as it kept the challenges facing you

149
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,150
但是你们是全球最顶尖的人才
are the greatest mankind has ever known.

150
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,620
虽然你们大部分都是穷逼
Plus, most of you are broke.

151
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,710
但是，我愿意和你们同行
also, I rather you work.

152
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,500
在这一刻，每一个学生都将成为这个项目的受益者
As of this moment, every student has been made an equal recipient

153
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,770
首届九月基金会资助
of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant.

154
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,570
你们所有的项目都会被无条件批准和资助
As in, all of your projects have just been approved and funded.

155
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,010
没有任何限制 也不会收税
No strings. No taxes.

156
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,430
只是......重新塑造未来
Just... reframe the future.

157
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,180
现在已经开始了
Starting now.

158
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,890
去打破樊笼吧
Go break some eggs.

159
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,340
这...太令人惊呼
That uh... That took my breathe away.

160
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,820
托尼，这么大方，这么多钱
Tony, so generous, so much money.

161
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,080
哇！我......出于好奇问一下
Wow! I... Out of curiosity and...

162
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,950
这部分资金会有任何部分提供给教师吗？
Will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty?

163
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,450
我知道听起来有点势力，但听我说完
I know, ooo, gross, but hear me out.

164
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,610
我有一个屌炸天的想法关于自制热狗
I have got this killer idea for a self cooking hotdog.

165
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,000
简单来说，通过化学雷管嵌入式...
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...

166
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,380
- 厕所在这边，是吗？ - 嗯啊 嵌入在肉轴上
- The Restroom this way, yeah? - Yeah. Embedding in the meat shaft.

167
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,610
斯塔克先生，我对提字器的小意外赶到非常抱歉
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the telepromter.

168
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,600
我不知道波茨小姐已经取消 他们没有时间去改字幕
I didn't know Miss Potts has canceled. They didn't have time to fix it.

169
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,860
没关系 我有点事要先走开
It's... fine. I'll be right back.

170
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,550
我们后续再聊
We'll catch up later.

171
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,210
你为那群年轻人做的事情太贴心了
That was really sweet, what you did for the young people.

172
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,260
哦，他们应得的
Oh, they deserve it.

173
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,660
“因为这一切有助于让我良心过得去
'Cos it helps to ease my conscious.

174
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,910
他们说，在慷慨和内疚之间的有必然的联系
They say, there's a correlation between generosity and guilt.

175
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,510
但是，你有钱
But, you got the money.

176
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,380
你就可以肆意打破“樊笼”
Break as many eggs as you like.

177
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,500
说的好
It's brilliant.

178
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,600
你要上去吗？
Are you going up?

179
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,090
我就呆着这里了
I'm right where I wanted to be.

180
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,210
好吧好吧 唉唉唉!
Okay, okay. Hey!

181
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,850
对不起 这是我的职业病
I'm sorry. It's my occupation hazard.

182
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,180
我为国务院工作人力资源部门工作
I work for the State department. Human resources.

183
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,940
我知道这很无聊
I know it's boring.

184
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,960
但是，它使我能够养大我的
But, it enabled me to raise a son.

185
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,270
我很自豪的把他带大成人
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

186
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,090
他的名字叫查理·斯宾塞
His name was Charlie Spencer.

187
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,420
但是你杀了他
Your murdered him.

188
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,170
在Sokovia
In Sokovia.

189
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
对于你来说毫不相干
Not that it matters in the least to you.

190
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,180
你以为你为我们而战
You think you fight for us.

191
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,070
你只是争取自己
You just fight for yourself.

192
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,540
谁去替我的儿子报仇，斯塔克先生？
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

193
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,180
他死了 这都是你惹的祸
He's dead. And I blame you.

194
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,540
11 个瓦甘达平民在那场袭击中遇害
11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation

195
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,850
就在复仇者和那群雇佣兵的战斗中
between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries

196
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,030
上个月，就在尼日利亚的拉各斯城市
in Lagos, Nigeria, last month.

197
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,950
与世无争的瓦甘达居民
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans

198
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,210
在拉各斯城市的那次任务中丧生
were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.

199
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,160
我国人民的鲜血洒在异国他乡
Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil.

200
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,370
不仅仅这些任务的动机是非法的，
Not only the cause of the actions are criminals,

201
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,160
而且
but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them.

202
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,660
牺牲无辜的性命取得的成功是一种失败
Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.

203
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,550
瓦甘达国王将会
The Wakanda king went on to...

204
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,530
这些超能力的家伙有什么执法权
What legal authority does an enhanced individual

205
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,320
像绯红女巫在尼日利亚那样去杀人呢？
like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeria?

206
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,420
- 都是我的错  - 错不在你
- It's my fault. - That's no true.

207
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,140
如果是这样打开电视继续听，他们说的就是我
Then turn the TV back on, you're being very specific.

208
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,800
我应该早点注意到那颗炸弹了
I should've grabbed that bomb as I'm the leader to deal with it.

209
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,910
但是当Rumlow提到巴基的时候.
Rumlow said 'Bucky' and...

210
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,180
一瞬间，我就像一个在布鲁克林16岁的小孩呆在那里
All of a sudden, I was a 16 year old kid again in Brooklyn.

211
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,910
群众死亡
People died.

212
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,800
- 这错在我身上  - 我们都有错
- It's on me. - It's on both of us.

213
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,880
这个工作...
This job...

214
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,510
我们试图挽救尽可能多的人
We try to save as many people as we can.

215
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,390
有时候，这并不意味着每个人，
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody,

216
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,530
但是，如果我们不能找到一种方法，住在一起，
but, if we can't find a way to live with that,

217
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,290
下次危机来临...
Next time...

218
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,950
那么没人出手相救就会血流成河
maybe nobody can be saved.

219
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,600
幻视，我们之前有说过你吧
Vis, we talked about this.

220
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,680
是的 但大门被打开了，所以我认为...
Yes. But the door was opened so I assumed...

221
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,390
罗杰斯队长希望当斯塔克先生抵达，我来通知他
Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.

222
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,360
谢谢 我马上下去
Thank you. I'll be right down.

223
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,210
那我还是大门吧
I'll... use the door.

224
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,840
哦，对了，他还带来了一个客人
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.

225
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,600
带了哪位客人？
You know who it is?

226
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,890
国务卿
The secretary of State.

227
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,920
5年前，我心脏病发作
Oh. 5 years ago, I had a heart attack.

228
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,470
那时候我正挥杆打高尔夫球
I dropped right in the middle of my batting swing.

229
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,870
后来，那是我一生中最好的一杆
Turned out, it was the best round of my life

230
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,790
因为经过13个小时的手术及心脏搭桥，
because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass.

231
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,830
我学会40年军队生涯从来没有教过我的东西
I found something 40 years in the army never taught me:

232
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,860
远见
Perspective.

233
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,260
全世界都亏欠了复仇者联盟
The world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt.

234
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,150
你...为我们而战，拯救了我们
You've... fought for us.

235
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,530
冒着你们的生命保护我们
Protected us. Risked your lives.

236
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,560
虽然很多人认为你是英雄
While a great many people see you as heroes.

237
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
但是也有很多人
There are some...

238
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,770
选择用“义务特警”这个词来形容你们
would prefer the word "vigilantes."

239
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,520
你会用什么词形容我们，国务卿先生
And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary.

240
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,280
我会用“危险”这个词来形容你们
How about "Dangerous?"

241
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,510
如果是你，你用什么词来形容这样一批在美国本土的超级英雄，
What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals,

242
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,490
一群经常忽略了主权边界并强加自己的意志在他人身上
who routinely ignores sovereign borders and inflict their will

243
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,340
一群肆意任为的家伙
wherever they choose and who, frankly,

244
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,750
完全不用去考虑任何的后果
seem unconcerned about what they leave behind them.

245
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,270
纽约（复联1中的复仇者大战外星人场景）
New York.

246
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,370
华盛顿（美队2中大战九头蛇场景）
Washington DC.

247
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,150
索科维亚（复联2中的大战奥创场景）
Sokovia.

248
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,180
拉各斯（片头中大战骷髅战士场景）
Lagos.

249
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,040
- 好吧，够了
Okay. That's enough.

250
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,860
在过去的4年中，你们滥用职权，毫无监管和纪律
For the past 4 years, you operated with unlimited power and no supervision.

251
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,510
世界各国政府再也无法忍受你们这样子，这是一份协议
That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate.

252
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,090
但我认为，我们还有一个解决方案
But I think we have a solution.

253
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,350
索科维亚超级英雄监管协议
The Sokovia accords.

254
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,560
由117个国家批准
Approved by 117 countries.

255
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,230
协议明确指出，复仇者联盟不得不再是一个私人组织
It states, that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization.

256
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,900
相反，他们会一个联合国专家小组的监督下运作，
Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations Panel,

257
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:25,590
由这个小组去评估和指挥
only when and if that Panel deems it necessary.

258
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,840
复仇者联盟的创立初衷是使世界变得更加安全
The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place.

259
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,630
我觉得我们做到了这一点
I feel we've done that.

260
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,420
队长请你告诉我，你知道雷神和绿巨人现在身处何方吗？
Tell me captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?

261
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,330
如果我把一份30万公吨核武器投错了地方，
If I misplaced a couple of 30 mega tonne nukes,

262
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,040
你知道这绝逼会有后果的
you can bet there'd be consequences

263
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,310
妥协 重组 这就是世界运作的规则
Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works.

264
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,390
相信我，这已经是折衷方案了
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

265
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,350
所以，会有突发情况
So, there are contingencies

266
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,040
3天后，联合国在维也纳开会批准该协定
3 days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.

267
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,140
所以，你们内部商量一下
So, talk it over.

268
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,790
如果我们不喜欢这样的决定呢？
And if we come to a decision you don't like?

269
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,510
那你们就可以退休了
Then you retire.

270
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,970
克利夫兰
CLEVELAND

271
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,700
你好？
Hello?

272
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,190
门口的是你的车吗？
Is this your car out front?

273
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,680
我不小心冲上路边撞到了
I jumped the curb.

274
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,270
也许我们可以私了
Maybe we could, take care of it ourselves.

275
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,080
如果你不想私了的话也可以报警，我没关系
If you prefer to call the cops, then, that's okay too, I guess.

276
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,420
不
No.

277
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,420
不要报警
No cops.

278
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,700
谢谢
Thank you.

279
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,560
你看起来真年轻，上校
You kept your looks, colonel.

280
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,330
祝贺你.

283
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,810
我的名字是泽莫
My name is Zemo.

284

我会重复我的问题
I will repeat my question.

285

行动报告  1991年12月16日
Mission report. December 16, 1991

286
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,470
你如何找到我？
How did you find me?

287
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,710
当神盾局陷落的时候，
When SHIELD fell,

288
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,270
黑寡妇发布的九头蛇文件向公众开放
Black widow released HYDRA files to the public.

289
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,290
数以百万计的文件，大部分是加密的，
Millions of pages much of it encrypted,

290
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,120
不容易破译
not easy to decipher.

291
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,550
可是
But,

292
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,410
我有经验
I have experience.

293
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,000
和耐心
And patience.

294
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,860
世事无难事，只怕有心人
A man can do anything if he has those.

295
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,020
你要什么？
What do you want?

296
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,790
行动报告  1991年12月16日
Mission report. December 16, 1991

297
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,310
见你的鬼去
Go to hell.

298
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,430
九头蛇组织早该烟飞烟灭
HYDRA deserves its place on the ashtray,

299
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,160
所以我根本不关心你的生死
so your death would not bother me.

300
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,660
但是我必须使用这本书，
But I have to use this book,

301
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,340
和其他血腥的方法来达到我的目的
and other bloodier methods to find what I need.

302
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,710
我也不想这样
I don't look forward to that.

303
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,110
你知道，也许你死 你的骄傲
You know, maybe you're dying for... your pride.

304
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,630
九头蛇万岁！
Hail, HYDRA.

305
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,560
国务卿罗斯，有国会荣誉勋章，比你获得的荣誉都多
Secretary Ross, has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is 1 more than you have.

306
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,140
所以，假设我们签了这协议
So, let's say we agree to this thing.

307
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,040
不久他们就会囚禁和限制我们
How long is it gonna be before they lo-jack us

308
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,370
就像一群普通罪犯那样
like a bunch of common criminals?

309
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,940
117个国家要署名了这份协议
A 117 countries want to sign this.

310
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,180
117，山姆，你看起来好像觉得很好玩的样子
117, Sam, and you're just like, "No, it's cool."

311
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,650
你什么时候变墙头草了？
How long are you going to play both sides?

312
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,240
- 我有一个公式  - 哦，这将算出一些东西
- I have an equation. - Oh, this will clear it up.

313
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,580
自从8年前，斯塔克先生宣布自己是钢铁侠，
In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man,

314
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:03,120
超级英雄的人数已成倍增长
the number of noted enhanced persons has grown exponentially.

315
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,330
而在同一时期，
And during the same period,

316
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,380
潜在的世界级灾难的数量
the number of potentially world-ending events

317
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,210
也在成倍地
has risen at a commissive rate.

318
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,900
你是说这是我们的错吗？
Are you saying it's our fault?

319
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,730
我说有可能是因果关系
I'm saying there maybe a causality.

320
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,040
我们这些超级英雄吸引了的极大的挑战
Our very strength invites challenge.

321
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,950
挑战煽动冲突
Challenge incites conflict.

322
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,500
和冲突......孕育着灾难
And conflict... breeds catastrophe.

323
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,620
监管
Oversight.

324
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,570
监管是不是一个随手拈来的想法
Oversight is not an idea that could be dismissed out-of-hand.

325
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,870
B ！
Boom.

326
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,520
托尼，你这是一反常态的安静
Tony, you're being uncharacteristically non-hyper verbal.

327
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,060
这是因为他已经打定了主意
That's because he's already made up his mind.

328
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,870
小子，你这么了解我
Boy, you know me so well.

329
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,330
事实上，我在缓解我的电磁头疼
Actually, I'm nursing my electromagnetic headache.

330
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,590
这是怎么回事，队长
That's what's going on, Cap.

331
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,820
这只是痛苦......说汉弗莱
It's just pain... says Humphrey.

332
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,590
谁在把咖啡渣的随便倒掉水槽的？
Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal?

333
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,510
我都和一群什么的人在一起？
Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?

334
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,050
哦，顺带一提，那是查尔斯·斯宾塞
Oh, that's Charles Spencer by the way.

335
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,400
他是一个不错的孩子 计算机工程学士学位
He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree.

336
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,330
GPA 3.5 3.6 GPA.

337
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,210
在因特尔有不错的职位 正在筹备秋季旅游计划
Had a floor level gig. An Intel plan for the fall.

338
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,820
他想放空一下心灵
But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul.

339
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,630
然后再回办公室努力工作
Before he park it behind then desk.

340
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,460
体验世界，或做点善事
See the world, maybe be of service.

341
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,530
查理不想去拉斯维加斯，如果换成是我我会这么做
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas which is what I would do.

342
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,840
他没有去巴黎或阿姆斯​​特丹 听起来很有趣
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam. Sounds fun.

343
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,320
他决定花他的夏季去为穷人建筑可持续的住房
He decided to spend his summer, building sustainable housing for the poor.

344
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,480
猜猜在哪里，Sokovia
Guess where, Sokovia.

345
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,020
他想有所作为，我想 我的意思是，我们不会知道
He want to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know

346
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,600
因为我们在和奥创大战的时候，整栋大楼砸向了他
because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass.

347
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,670
没有任何的决策过程
There's no decision making process here.

348
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,080
我们需要被监管
We need to be put in check.

349
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,230
无论什么样的形式，我都愿意接受
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

350
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,270
如果我们不能接受的限制，我们为所欲为，
If we can't accept limitations, we're bounderless,

351
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,810
那我们和那群恶棍有什么差别
we're no better than the bad guys.

352
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,410
托尼，有人死在你看顾下，但是你不要放弃
Tony, someone dies on you watch, you don't give up.

353
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,580
是谁说过我们要放弃？
Who said we're giving up?

354
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,240
我们不为自己的所作所为负责
We are, for not taking responsibility for our actions.

355
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,870
- 这些文件只是转移了罪责  - 对不起 史蒂夫，这...
- These documents just shifts the blames. - Sorry. Steve, that...

356
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,550
这是危险的自大
That is dangerously arrogant.

357
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,640
这可是联合国大会啊
This is the United Nations we're talking about.

358
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,410
这不是世界上安理会，这不是神盾局，这不是九头蛇
It's not the world security council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.

359
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,260
是的，但它是由人的议事日程和动机来运行
No, but it's run by people with agendas and agendas change.

360
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,200
那很好 这就是为什么我在这里
That's good. That's why I'm here.

361
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,250
当我意识到我是什么人的武器能够在他人之手，
When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands,

362
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,610
我将它关闭并停止制造它们
I shut it down and stop manufacturing them.

363
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,290
托尼 你选择这样做
Tony. You chose to do that.

364
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,710
如果我们签署这些，我们放弃我们的选择权
If we sign these, we surrender our right to choose.

365
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,580
万一这个小组派我们去一些我们不认为我们应该去的地方，
What if this Panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go.

366
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,510
万一真的某个地方出事了，我们需要去的，他们不让我们
What if it's somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us.

367
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,660
我们也许不是完美的，但最安全的手仍然是我们自己
We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.

368
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,210
如果我们现在不签署这协议，迟早他们会用方法让我们签署的
If we don't do this now, it's going to be done to us later.

369
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,900
这是一个不争的现实
That's a fact. That won't be pretty.

370
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,910
- 你说他们会来找我  - 我们会保护你
- You're saying they will come for me. - We will protect you.

371
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,820
也许托尼是正确的
Maybe Tony is right.

372
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,150
如果我们有一个手仍然可以操纵方向盘
If, we have one hand on the wheel that can still steer.

373
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,880
这是前几年告诉告诉我要和政府作对的黑寡妇所的话吗？
Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss our ass a few years ago.

374
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,810
我只是...监控
I'm just... monitoring.

375
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,220
我们已经犯了一些非常公开的错误
We have made some very public mistakes.

376
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,420
我们需要赢得我们的信任了
We need to win our trust back.

377
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,260
我很抱歉，我刚听错，你还是你同意我的意见
I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me.

378
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,830
- 哦，我希望把它收回  - 不不不 你不能收回它
- Oh, I want to take it back. - No, no, no. You can't retract it.

379
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,530
谢谢 我对你所作的刮目相看
Thank you. I'm impress by what you did.

380
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,300
好吧，就先这样吧
Okay, case close.

381
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,430
- 我赢了  - [她已经去世，在安稳的梦中 ]
- I win. - [She's gone. In her sleep.]

382
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,200
我得走了.
I have to go.

383
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,460
伦敦
LONDON

384
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,790
MARGARET“PEGGY”卡特
MARGARET "PEGGY" CARTER

385
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,010
现在
And now,

386
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,300
我想邀请莎朗·卡特上来，说了几句话
I would like to invite Sharon Carter, to come up and say a few words.

387
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,370
玛格丽特·卡特被称为大多数作为神盾局的创始人
Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD.

388
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,760
但在我心目中，我只知道她是佩吉阿姨
But I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

389
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,400
她在她的办公室的照片
She had a photograph in her office.

390
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,860
佩吉阿姨站在旁边的肯尼迪总统
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

391
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,430
作为一个孩子，感觉这很酷
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

392
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,690
但是，这是一个身负重任的工作
But, it was a lot to live up to.

393
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,030
这就是为什么我从来没有告诉任何人我们是亲戚
Which is why I never told anyone we were related.

394
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,910
有一次我问她怎么设法掌握外交和间谍活动
I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage

395
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,720
在那个个女性备受歧视的年代，
at a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either.

396
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,600
她说，当你觉得可以妥协的时候，要适时妥协
And she said, compromise when you can.

397
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,110
当你觉得不能妥协，那么就要坚守你的信念
When you can't, don't.

398
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,520
即使每个人都告诉你，你认为正确的事情是错的
Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right.

399
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,720
即使全世界都在告诉叫你挪开
Even if the whole world is telling you to move.

400
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,740
但是这是你的责任，像一棵树那样去坚守
It is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree,

401
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,500
看着他们的眼睛，他们说：“不......
look them in they eye and say, " No...

402
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,390
... 你挪开

403
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,010
当我从冰船里复活，
When I came out of the ice,

404
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,540
我以为她已经离世
thought I wanted to ignore she was gone.

405
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,610
当我发现她还活着，
When I found out that she was alive,

406
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,420
我很幸运地拥有她

407

她很庆幸你回来了

飞机上很多位置
There is plenty of room on the jet.

415
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:16,850
只是因为它是最小阻力并不意味着它是在错误的道路
Just because it's the path of least resistance does mean it's the wrong path.

416
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,110
我们坚守在一起才是最重要的
Staying together is more important than how we stay together.

417
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,890
什么是我们放弃去签署这协议呢？
What are we giving up to do it?

418

对不起，小娜 我不能签字

你做的挺不错的

考虑到你上次去国会山的表现

好吧，我不是

That alone, makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.

436
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,440
为什么？你不赞成的这一切？

该协定，是的 政治，不是真的
The Accords, yes. The politics, not really.

我们不会再让厄运降临到我们身上

如果他已经做到这个地步

我就应该亲手抓他

我只是想确保我们考虑周全
I just want to make sure we considered all our options.

532
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,800
我会做的 我会做的 不要担心
I'll do it. I'll do it. Don't worry.

533
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:01,090
布加勒斯特
BUCHAREST

534
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,770

你是史蒂夫

539
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,450
我在博物馆了解你

他们已经开始设置防线了

我知道你很紧张

542

你有充足的理由

543
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,790
但是，你在撒谎
But you're lying.

544
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,620
我没在维也纳 我已经金盆洗手

他们进入大楼
They're entering the building.

546

Well, the people who think you did are coming here now.

547
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,510
他们不打算让你还活着
And they're not planning on taking you alive.

548
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:52,100
这是聪明的策略
That's smart. Good strategy.

549
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,360
他们在屋顶上 我被曝光了
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.

550
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,400
这没必要武力来解决，巴克
This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.

551
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,470

552
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,310
你从河里救了我 为什么？

我不会杀死任何人

559
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,280
犯罪嫌疑人逃脱 抓住他！

560
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:46,940
来吧

我正在找

563
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,060
- 山姆  - 得到它了

564
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,220
举手投降！

565
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,260
举手投降

566
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,750
- 山姆，我甩不掉这家伙  - 就在你后面
- Sam, I can't shake this guy. - Right behind you.

567
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:06,010
马上举手投降
Stand down. Now.

568
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,500
恭喜你，队长 你已经是个罪犯
Congratulations, Captain. You're a criminal.

569
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,700
殿下
Your highness.

570
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,390
少许辣椒叶
A pinch of paprika.

571
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,300
少许是多少？
A pinch.

572
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,180
那是红椒鸡吗？
Is that Paprikash?

573
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,580
我想这可以提提神
I thought it might... lift your spirits.

574
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,440
提神
Spirits lifted.

575
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:19,340
我得解释一下，我其实...
In my defense, I haven't actually...

576
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,950
- 在之前没吃过任何东西，所以...  - 明白，明白
- eaten anything before, so... - Aye, aye.

577
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,400
请.
Please.

578
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:31,760
- 旺达  - 嗯
- Wanda. - Hmm.

579
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,170
大家都喜欢你，旺达

580
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,680
- 谢谢  - 哦，不客气
- Thanks. - Oh, you're welcome.

581
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,420
不，这是在他们的大脑里杏仁核一...不自觉的反应
No. It's a... involuntary response in their amygdala

582
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,620
他们不禁怕你
they can't help but be afraid of you.

583
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,870
你会怕我吗？
Are you?

584
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,600
我的扁桃体是合成的，所以...
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

585
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:53,240
我曾一度自以为是
I used to think of myself one way.

586
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:57,550
但是，在这事之后
But, after this.

587
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,870
我变成另一个人了
I am something else.

588
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:02,810
也许还是我自己，我想
And still me, I think.

589
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:08,840
但是......这不是其他人看到的我
But... that's not what everyone else sees.

590
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,570
嗯，我不知道这是什么
Do you know, I don't know what this is.

591
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,990
真的不知道
Not really.

592
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,670
我知道这不是来自这个世界的
I know it's not of this world.

593
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,990
他是由于洛基（雷神的弟弟）所赋予的能力
But it powered Loki staff, gave you your abilities. But...

594
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:28,750
它真正的本质是一个谜 然而，这是我的一部分
its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.

595
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,500
你怕它吗？
Are you afraid of it?

596
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:32,860
我想了解它
I wish to understand it.

597
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,320
我了解的越多，它越 控制了我
The more I do, the less it controls me.

598
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:40,580
有一天，谁知道，我可能甚至控制它
One day, who knows, I may even control it.

599
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,150
我不知道这是什么，但它绝不是辣椒
I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika.

600
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:52,170
我去会商店，20分钟回来
I'm gonna go to the store, I'll be back in 20 minutes.

601
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,780
或者，我们可以叫外卖比萨？
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

602
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,000
幻视，你不让我离开？
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

603
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,410
- 这是安全性的问题  - 我能保护自己
- It's a question of safety. - I can protect myself.

604
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,040
不是为了
Not yours.

605
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:14,130
斯塔克先生想避免其它突发公共事件的可能性
Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident.

606
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,660
直到协议达到一定阶段
Until the Accords are a... more secured foundation.

607
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,160
那你自己想干什么？
And what do you want?

608
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,040
让人们看到我眼中的你
For people to see you... as I do.

609
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,150
柏林

610
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,050
- 所以，你喜欢猫？ - 山姆
- So, you like cats? - Sam.

611
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,160
一个穿得黑猫警长的制服的家伙，你不想知道为什么吗？
What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?

612
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,370
你的装备 是钒合金制作的？
Your suit. A Vibranium?

613
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:19,010
黑豹一直在瓦甘达世世代代保护着人们
The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations.

614
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,180
一代一代的战士相传
A mantle passed from warrior to warrior.

615
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,730
而现在，因为你的朋友杀害我的父亲，
And now because your friend murdered my father,

616
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,640
我就只有继承黑豹这衣钵
I also wear the mantle of king.

617
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:36,480
所以我问你，我作为黑豹和国王的双重身份，
So I ask you, as both warrior and king,

618
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:41,350
你觉得你的朋友还可以安全多久？
how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?

619
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,930
会发生什么事情呢?
What's going to happen?

620
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,940
这应该同样的事情发生在你身上

我不希望看到窗外有人到处乱飞在
I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that.

627
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,880
你们在办公室里好好呆着，就不用在监狱里

628
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,180
并帮我一个忙，好好呆着

我不打算在去任何地方

630
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,830
说多一句 这就是让事情变得更糟

从技术上讲，这是政府的财产

我想，你怎么称呼它？

很抱歉，托尼 我不知道

几年前，我几乎失去了她，为了她我丢掉了所有的盔甲
Few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits.

Cause the truth is I don't wanna stop.

664
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,900
我不想失去这条线索
I don't want to lose her.

665
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:48,370
我想也许该协定可以解决这样的分歧
I thought maybe the Accords can split the difference.

666
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:53,920
在她的话来说，我是她的难以驾驭的男人
In her defense, I'm her handful.

667
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:59,260
然而，我爸爸也是一个难以驾驭的家伙，但他和妈妈似乎相处不错
Yet, dad was a pain in the ass, but he and mom always made it work.

668
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,590
我很高兴霍华德结婚了
You know, I'm glad Howard got married.

669
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,490
我只知道他当时很年轻，单身
I only knew him when he was young and single.

670
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,840
真的吗？你们两个知道对方？
Oh really? You two know each other?

671
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:10,100
他从来没有提到 也许只有一千倍
He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times.

672
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,600
上帝，我恨你
God, I hated you.

673
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,480
我并不想为难
I don't mean to make things difficult.

674
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,010
我知道 因为你是一个很有礼貌的人
I know. Because you're a very polite person.

675
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,510
如果我看到有事发生，我不能忽视它
If I see a situation pointed south, I can't ignore it.

676
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:26,300
- 有时候我希望我能  - 不，你不能
- Sometimes I wish I could. - No, you don't.

677
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,250
对，我不能 有时...
No, I don't. Sometimes...

678
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,700
有时我想一拳打掉你那排完美的牙齿
Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth.

679
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,190
但我不希望看到你也走了
But I don't wanna see you gone.

680
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,820
我们需要你，队长
We need you, Cap.

681
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,110
别等到事情无法挽回了，请签下吧
Until further nothing's happen that can't be undone, please... sign.

682
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,360
我们可以在过去24小时内所作所为都合法化
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

683
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,970
巴恩斯被转移到美国精神康复中心，而不是瓦甘达的监狱
Barnes gets transferred to an American psych center instead of a Wakanda prison.

684
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,040
我不是说这是不可能的 但必须有所保障
I'm not saying it's impossible. But there would have to be safeguards

685
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,370
当然
Sure.

686
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,470
一旦我们先解决了群众的公关问题，这些文件可以修改的
Once we put out the PR fire, these documents can be amended.

687
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,560
我提出一项动议，让你你和旺达恢复自由
I filed a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated.

688
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,270
- 旺达？旺达怎么了？ - 她很好
- Wanda? What about Wanda? - She's fine.

689
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:18,170
她被限制在我的居所  幻视在陪她
She's confined in a compound currently. Vision's keeping her company.

690
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,270
哦，上帝，托尼！每次
Oh God, Tony! Every time.

691
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,380
每当我以为你想明白了
Every time I think you're seeing things the right way...

692
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,850
什么？我居所有100亩，和一个游泳池
What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool.

693
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,880
它有一个放映室 还有更差的方式来保护大家吗？
It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.

694
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,370
保护？你眼里觉得这是保护吗？
Protection? Is that how you see this?

695
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,470
这是保护？这是拘留，托尼
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

696
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,770
她不是美国公民
She's not a US Citizen

697
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,840
- 哦，少来这套吧，托尼  - 他们不会发放签证给“大规模杀伤性武器”
- Oh, come on, Tony. - and they don't grant visas to Weapons of Mass Destruction.

698
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,350
- 她是一个孩子！ - 别这样好吗！
- She's a kid! - GIVE ME A BREAK!

699

我只是做我所该做的

帮助大家

701
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,770
你一直对自己这样说
You keep telling yourself that.

702
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,860
抱歉打断一下
Hate to break up the set.

703
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,980
您好，巴恩斯先生

704
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,060
我一直由联合国送到这里来给你做鉴定
I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you.

705
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,830
介意我坐在这吗？
Do you mind if I sit?

706

708

Bird costume? Come on.

709
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,760
又不是我写的
I didn't write it.

710
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,870
我不是来这里审判你的
I'm not here to judge you.

711
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,640
我只想问你几个问题

712
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,580
你知道你在哪里，詹姆斯？
Do you know where you are, James?

713
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,980
我不能帮你，如果你不跟我说话，詹姆斯
I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.

714

Here. Just sign here.

719
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,470
- 这里？ - 是啊
- Here? - Yeah.

720
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:25,010
为什么会专案组在一开始就发布这张照片？
Why would the task force release this photo to begin with?

721
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,350
传播出去，尽量让更多人知道？
Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?

722
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,620
对
Right.

723
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,440
这是一个动员全世界找出特定的人的绝佳办法
It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding.

724
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,440

725
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,660
让7亿人在寻找冬兵
It got 7 million people looking for the Winter soldier.

726
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,510
你是说有人为了找到了他去陷害他
You're saying someone framed him to find him.

727
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,080
史蒂夫，我们找了这个家伙2年，一无所获
Steve, we looked for the guy for 2 years and found nothing.

728
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:41,310
我们没有轰炸了联合国 这可以动员全世界
We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.

729
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,450
所以这就是说无论是谁陷害了他
So? That doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him

730
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,790
那个人都保证我们找不到他
would get him a guarantees that we would.

731
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,610
恩
Yeah.

732

告诉我，巴基
Tell me Bucky.

733
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,940
你已经见多了大场面，不是吗？
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

734
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,680
我不说.
I don't want to talk about it.

735
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:04,920
你觉得...
You feel that...

736
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:08,740
如果你打开​​你的嘴，恐怖可能永远不会停下来
if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop.

737
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,770
不用担心

- What the hell is this? - Why don't we discuss your home?

不罗马尼亚 当然不是布鲁克林，没有

那个医生费了那么多功夫只是为了和你呆10分钟
The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you.

799
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:42,070
我希望你除了不知道还有其他的可以想起
I need you to do better than "I don't know."

800
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,720
他想知道西伯利亚
He wanted to know about Siberia.

801
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:52,100
我被关押的那个地方
Where I was kept.

802
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:57,480
- 他想确切地知道在哪里  - 他为什么要知道？
- He wanted to know exactly where. - Why would he need to know that?

803
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,000
因为我不是唯一的冬兵
Because I'm not the only Winter soldier.

804
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,790
1991年
1991

805
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:36,830
干得好
Good job.

806
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,830
放我出去
Get me out of here.

807
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:05,990
- 他们是谁？ - 最精锐的敢死队
- Who were they? - The most elite death squad.

808
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:08,360
在九头蛇组织里杀人无数
More kills than anyone in the HYDRA history.

809
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:11,090
- 这就是没注射血清前  - 他们都变成和你一样的吗？
- And that was before the serum. - They all turned out like you?

810
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,490
比我更恐怖
Worse.

811
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:15,390
那个医生，他可以控制他们？
The doctor, can he control them?

812
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,970
绝对可以
Enough.

813
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,900
- 他说他希望看到一个帝国陷落  - 控制了这些家伙，他能​​做到这一点
- He said he wanted to see an empire fall. - With these guys he can do it.

814
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,220
他们说30种语言，可以在众目睽睽下隐藏，
They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight,

815
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,590
渗透，暗杀，破坏，
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize,

816
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,720
他们可以在1夜直接攻陷任何国家
They can take a whole country down in 1 night.

817
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,930
然而你却一点都察觉不到
You'd never see them coming.

818
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,970
如果我们能寻找帮助.
This would be a lot easier if we could...

819
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:35,170
如果我们通知东尼
If we call Tony.

820
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,920
- 算了，他不会相信我们  - 即使他相信了
- Oh, he won't believe us. - Even if he did.

821
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,110
天知道协议让不让他帮忙
Who knows if the Accords will let him help.

822
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,500
我们要靠自己了
We're on our own.

823
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:44,670
这不一定
Maybe not.

824
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,620
我认识一个人（此处指蚁人）
I know a guy.

825
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:51,640
我想你也不知道他们在哪里吧
And I don't suppose you have any idea where they are.

826
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,990
我们很快找出  GSG-9已经覆盖了整个区域
We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered.

827
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:56,400
监查机全天候排查
Recons flying 24/7.

828
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:57,860
一旦有线索，我们将马上处理
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it

829
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:59,760
你不明白，斯塔克 这是不是你来处理
You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle.

830
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:03,670
这显然​​你不能做到客观 我已经派出了特别行动
It's clearly you can't be objective. I'm putting special ops on this.

831
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,450
如果他们交锋了，你会让他们杀史蒂夫·罗杰斯？
And what happens when the shooting starts, let them kill Steve Rogers?

832
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,010
如果他肆意要挑起事端的话，是的
If we are provoked.

833
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,580
如果不是因为罗杰斯，巴恩斯本来在罗马尼亚被歼灭了
Barnes would have been eliminate in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

834
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:15,840
那么多无辜的人就不会
There are dead people who would be alive now.

835
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:17,870
你自己算一算这笔账
Feel free to check my math.

836
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:21,130
恕我直言，你不可能通过一群穿防弹服的家伙就把事情解决了
All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullet vest.

837
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,440
你得让我们带他进来
You got to let us bring him in.

838
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:24,410
那会和上一次有什么不同？
And how will that end any differently from the last time.

839
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:28,440
因为这次我不会只穿平底便鞋和普通西装
Because this time I won't be wearing Loafers and a silk suit.

840
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:30,790
我保证只需要72个小时
72 hours, guaranteed.

841
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,940
36小时
36 hours.

842
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:35,920
巴恩斯
Barnes.

843
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,000
罗杰斯 威尔逊
Rogers. Wilson.

844
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,750
谢谢你
Thank you, sir.

845
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,310
我的左臂麻木，是正常​​的吗？
My left arm is numb, is that normal?

846
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:52,560
你还好吗？
You alright?

847
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,110
一直很好
Always.

848
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,710
36个小时，天哪
36 hours, jeez.

849
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,950
- 我们严重人手不足  - oh,yeah
- We're seriously understaffed. - Oh, yeah.

850
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:06,670
如果有绿巨人相助的话 胜算会大一点吗？
It would be great if we have a hulk, right about now. Any shot?

851
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,040
不
No.

852
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,910
你真的认为他会站在我们这一边？
You really think he'd be on our side?

853
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,080
我知道
I know.

854
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:15,040
- 我有一个想法  - 我也是
- I've an idea. - Me too.

855
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,050
- 你的是啥呢？ - 下楼
- What's yours? - Downstairs.

856
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,890
你的是啥？
What's yours?

857
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,490
皇后区
QUEENS

858
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,060
- 嘿，梅婶婶  - 嘿
- Hey, Aunt May. - Hey.

859
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,200
- 今天在学校怎么样？ - 好的
- How was school today? - Okay.

860
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:52,140
有一辆叼炸天的车停在外面.
This crazy car parked outside...

861
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,550
- 哦，帕克先生  - 嗯
- Oh, Mr. Parker. - Umm.

862
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,170
你又在做什么？
What. What are you doing...?

863

嘿 我 - 我 - 我彼得
Hey. I'm-I'm-I'm Peter.

- Tony. - What are...

865
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,550
你，你， 你在这里做什么？
What are you-What are you- What are you doing here?

866
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,770
我们是时候见面了 你已经收到我的电子邮件，对不对？
It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?

867
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:11,850
- 对？ - 是啊 是啊
- Right? - Yeah. Yeah.

868
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,220
- 关于...  - 你没告诉我关于什么
- Regarding the... - You didn't tell me about the grant.

869
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,750
- 关于资金补助  - 九月基金会
- About the grant. - The September Foundation.

870
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,240
- 对  - 对对，申请过那个
- Right. - Yeah. Remember when you applied.

871
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,900
- 是啊  - 我批准了
- Yeah. - I approved.

872
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:22,410
所以，现在，我们可以来聊聊这笔生意
So now, we're in business.

873
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,330
你没有告诉我这些 怎么回事？
You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that?

874
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,750
- 你为啥没告诉我呢？ - 为什么，我只是，我只是...
- You're keeping secrets from me? - Why, I just, I just...

875
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:27,290
我只想让你惊喜一下嘛
I just know how much you love surprises,

876
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,410
所以我想我会让你知道... ...
so I thought I would let you know... wh...

877
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,360
- 反正，我申请了什么？ - 我们就在这里敲定
- Anyway, what did I apply for? - That's what I'm here to hash out.

878
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:34,190
好的 赶紧赶紧
Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.

879
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,680
她是如此火辣我很难相信她已经是你的阿姨了
It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.

880
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,870
我们有各种形状和大小，你知道
We come in all shapes and sizes, you know.

881
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:41,970
这种核桃烘烤面包是例外
This walnut bake loaf is exceptional.

882
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,560
- 让我打断一下  - 啊？
- Let me just stop you there. - Yeah?

883
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:47,580
难道这笔款项一样，得到了资金介入或什么？没有？
Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?

884
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,740
- 是啊  - 是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

885
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,320
- 这是相当充足的资金  - 哇
- It's pretty well funded. - Wow.

886
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:52,160
看看你在和谁说话
Look who you're talking to.

887
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,830
- 我可以和他聊5分钟吗？ - 当然
- Can I have 5 minutes with him? - Sure.

888
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,710
至于核桃烘烤面包，还好吧
As walnut bake loaves go, that wasn't bad.

889
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:07,470
哦 你在这里搞复古的高科技，是吧？
Oh. What do we have here, retro tech, huh?

890
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:10,540
- 在哪里弄来的？旧货店？淘宝？ - 呃，其实垃圾
- Thrift store? Salvation army? - Uh, the garbage actually.

891
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,650
- 你是一个垃圾箱潜水员  - 是啊，我是...
- You're a dumpster diver. - Yeah, I was...

892
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,210
Anyway，听着
Anyway, look. Umm.

893
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:15,970
我绝对没有申请拨款的
I definitely did not apply for your grant.

894
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:17,700
- 诶，诶，诶 我先  - 好的
- Uh,uh. Me first. - Okay.

895
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,430
先来简单的几个小问题
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

896
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,860
这就是你，对不对？
That's you, right?

897
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:24,910
不
Um, no.

898
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,750
- 你在干嘛？ - 啊
- What do you. What do you... - Yeah.

899
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,180
看那样子
Look at you go.

900
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,550
哇，好一手！ 3000英镑  40英里一个小时
Wow, nice catch! 3000 pounds. 40 miles an hour.

901
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:35,370
这并不容易 你的技能挺牛逼  It’s not easy.
You got mad skills.

902
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,230
这一切，这一切都在Youtube上被P过的
That's all-That's all on Youtube though right.

903
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,030
我是说你看到这些的时候
I mean that's where you found it.

904
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,480
因为你知道那都是假的 这一切都被P过了
Cause' you know that's all fake. It's all done on a computer?

905
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:42,820
嗯哼
Mm-Hmm.

906
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,100
这就像那些奇异视频......
It's like that video that records...

907
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,900
对对.....你的意思是像在凤凰城上空的UFO？
Yea yea yea yea...oh you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?

908
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,090
完全正确！
Exactly!

909
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,740
要不然还有什么？
What have we here?

910
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,310
呃...这是一个...
Uh... That's a...

911
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,190
那么
So.

912
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:00,720
你这个... ...蜘蛛精
You're this... Spider... ling.

913
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:03,430
打击犯罪蜘蛛......你是蜘蛛孩？
Crime fighting Spider... You're Spider-Boy?

914
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,320
小号...蜘蛛侠
S... Spider-Man.

915
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,360
不是那些在奇装怪服里，不是那种
Not in that wanzie, you're not.

916
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:11,780
这不是奇装怪服
It's not a wanzie.

917
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,330
你不会相信我今天过得挺好的，斯塔克先生
You won't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark.

918
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:20,130
别错过我的火车 这完好无损的DVD播放机只是放在那里，... Didn’t miss my trains. This perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there and...

919
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:23,330
代数测试 搞定了！
Algebra test. Nailed it!

920
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,920
还有谁知道？
Who else knows? Anybody?

921
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,190
没人知道
Nobody.

922
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:31,340
- 即使你的......非常迷人的阿姨？ - 她也不知道
- Not even your...unusually attractive Aunt? - No.

923
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,310
不不 不不 如果她知道，她会被吓坏
No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out.

924
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:36,180
而当她吓坏了，我也会吓坏了
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

925
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,320
你知道吗，我认为这织带是真的很酷？
You know what I think is really cool? This webbing.

926
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,400
拉伸强度爆表了
Tensile strength is off the charts

927
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:45,650
- 谁制造的呢？ - 我
- Who manufactured them? - I did.

928
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:47,400
飞檐走壁
Climbing the walls.

929
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,490
你是如何做的呢？粘性手套
How are you doing that? Cohesive gloves.

930
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,240
说来话长 我呃...
It's a long story. I was uh...

931
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:53,500
！你有透视功能吗？
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

932
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,380
是 我有！我有
Yes. Yes, I can! I can.

933
01:19:56,950 --> 01:20:00,390
我可以透视 好嘛？这只是因为...
I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that...

934
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:04,740
当那时...发生了那些事，我的感官灵敏度变得超强
when...whatever happened happened, it's like my senses have been dialed to 11.

935
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:09,260
有太多的信息摄入，所以......他们可以帮助我集中
There's way too much input, so... they just kinda help me focus.

936
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,930
你的装备急需升级
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

937
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,600
全面性的升级
Systemic, top to bottom.

938
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:16,120
100%的恢复 这就是为什么我在这里
100-point restoration. That's why I'm here

939
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,180
那你在这干嘛？
Why are you doing this?

940
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,130
我想知道你的动机是什么？
I got to know. What's your MO.

941
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,740
是什么驱使你早上起床？
What gets you out of that twin bed in the morning?

942
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,270
是因为...
Because...

943
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,130
......因为我一直在做自己想做的， 
... because I’ve been me my whole life,

944
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:35,230
- 我拥有这些超能力有6个月  - 嗯  
- and I’ve had these powers for 6 months.- Mm-Hm.

945
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:38,160
我读书，我装电脑...
I read books, I build computers...

946
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:41,590
和，是的 我喜欢踢足球
And-And yeah. I would love to play football.

947
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,310
但因为我的超能力我不能踢足球了
But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.

948
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,140
- 当然  因为你是不同的  - 没错
- Sure. 'Cause you're different. - Exactly.

949
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,950
但我不能告诉任何人说，所以我不是
But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not.

950
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,290
当你拥有这些能力，
When you can do the things that I can,

951
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,900
但是你不
but you don't...

952
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,400
不去阻止坏事的发生
and then the bad things happen,

953
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:03,600
那么将会归咎于你
they happen because of you.

954
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:10,790
所以，你去帮你的小伙伴 你想尽一份责任
So you wanna look out for the little guy. You wanna do your part.

955
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:12,520
让世界一切变得更美好，对不对？
Make the world a better place all that, right?

956
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:16,060
是啊 只能帮助一下自己的小伙伴
Yeah. Yeah just looking out... for the little guy.

957
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,400
就是这么多了
That's-That's what it is.

958
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:28,000
我要坐在这里，你移开你的腿
I'm going to sit here, so you move the leg.

959
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,030
- 你有护照吗？ - 没有
- You got passport? - Uh, no.

960
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,610
- 我甚至不具备驾驶执照  - 你去过德国？
- I don't even have a driving license. - You ever been to Germany?

961
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,820
- 没 - 哦，你会爱上它
- No. - Oh, you'll love it.

962
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,570
- 我不能去德国！ - 为什么？
- I can't go to Germany! - Why?

963
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,350
我...要做功课
I got... homework.

964
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,760
好吧，我会假装你没有说过
Alright, I gonna pretend you didn't say that.

965
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:52,370
我 - 我是认真的！我不能就这样辍学！
I'm-I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!

966
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:53,700
是有点危险的
Might be a little dangerous.

967
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,560
最好告诉你火辣的阿姨我带你实地考察
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.

968
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,160
别告诉伯母  Don’t tell Aunt May.

969
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,890
好吧，蜘蛛侠
Alright, Spider-Man.

970
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,970
- 帮我弄开这些啊  - 对不起，马上
- Get me out of this. - I'm sorry, I'll get that.

971
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:24,360
- 发生了什么？ - 请呆在这
- What is it? - Stay here, please.

972
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:34,090
- 我想我应该敲门  - 哦，我的上帝
- Guess I should have knocked. - Oh my god.

973
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,050
- 你在这里做什么？ - 来让我的孩子失望
- What are you doing here? - Disappointing my kids.

974
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,970
我应该和他们去滑水
I'm suppose to go water skiing.

975
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:46,110
队长需要我们的帮助，来吧
Cap needs our help, come on.

976
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,630
克林特！
Clint!

977
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,740
你不应该在这里
You should not be here.

978
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,010
真的？
Really?

979
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:57,300
我退休了不到5分钟呢？而这一切就乱成翔了
I retired for, what, like 5 minutes? And it all goes to shit.

980
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,870
请考虑你的行为的后果
Please consider the consequences of your actions.

981
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:01,850
好吧，我已经考虑过了
Okay, they're considered.

982
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,360
好吧，我们得走了
Okay, we got to go.

983
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,040
它是这样的
It's this way.

984
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,540
我已经造成了够多麻烦了
I've caused enough problems.

985
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,920
你得帮我，旺达
You got to help me, Wanda.

986
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,710
...您可以去高中
... you can go to high school.

987
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:23,390
你想弥补过错
You want to make amends. You get off your ass.

988
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,860
该死
Shit.

989
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,830
早知道先做一下热身
I know I should have stretch.

990
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,580
- 克林特，你打不过我的  - 我知道我打不过
- Clint, you can't overpower me. - I know I can't

991
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,880
但是，她可以
But, she can.

992
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,720
幻视 够了，放了他
Vision. That's enough, let him go.

993
01:23:58,110 --> 01:24:01,210
- 我要走了  - 我不能让你走
- I'm leaving. - I can't let you.

994
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:07,160
对不起
I'm sorry.

995
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:12,390
如果你这样做，
If you do this,

996
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:16,140
大家将永远害怕你
they will never stop being afraid of you.

997
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:20,870
我无法控制自己的恐惧，只有我自己
I can't control their fear, only my own.

998
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:34,180
啊...
Oh...

999
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,770
来吧 我们得赶去下一站
Come on. We got one more stop.

1000
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,670
这只是时间问题
It's just a matter of time.

1001
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:46,120
我们的卫星正在运行的面部，生物和行为模式扫描
Our satellites are running facial, biometric and behavioral pattern scans.

1002
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:52,560
滚开，别挡着
Move, or you will be moved.

1003
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,160
听起来真有意思，
As entertaining as that would be.

1004
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:58,500
你真的以为你能找到他吗？
You really think you can find him?

1005
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,630
我们的资源是相当大的
Our resources are considerable.

1006
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,140
是啊 世界花了70年才找到巴恩斯
Yeah. It took the world 70 years to find Barnes.

1007
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:06,190
所以，你可以只花大概一半的时间比他们做得更好
So, you could probably do better than them by half that time.

1008
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,610
你知道他们在哪里
You know where they are.

1009
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:10,750
我知道有人知道
I know someone who does.

1010
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:15,970
我不知道你理解了全身而退的概念
I'm not sure you understand the concept of a get away car.

1011
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,680
它的低调
It's low profile.

1012
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:21,030
很好，因为这东西往往会吸引观众
Good, 'cause this stuff tends to draw a crowd.

1013
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:25,390
- 你能移前一下你的座位吗？ - 不能
- Can you move your seat up? - No.

1014
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:26,900
我又欠你的
I owe you again.

1015
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,830
我得记下来
I'm keeping a list.

1016
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,100
你知道，他差点杀死我
You know, he kind of try to kill me.

1017
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,450
对不起，我会记下来的
Sorry, I'll put it on the list.

1018
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:42,410
他们会来找你
They're going to come looking for you.

1019
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,610
我知道
I know.

1020
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,330
谢谢你，莎伦
Thank you, Sharon.

1021
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,730
- 这是...  - 太晚了
- That was... - Late.

1022
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,410
太他妈正确了
Damn right.

1023
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,320
- 我应该走了  - 好的
- I should go. - Okay.

1024
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:39,220
队长
Cap.

1025
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:41,160
你知道我如果有选择也不会找你了
You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.

1026
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:45,410
嗨，老兄，你帮我个忙 再说......我站在你这边
Hey man, you're doing me a favour. Besides... I'm on your team.

1027
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,290
- 感谢你帮了我  - 是时候动起来了
- Thanks for having my back. - It was time to get off my ass.

1028
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,120
我们新的小伙伴呢？
About our other recruit.

1029
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,050
他准备好了
He's ready to go.

1030
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,750
我应该让他喝一点咖啡，不过
I have to put a little coffee in him, but...

1031
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,850
..他应该是不错的
.. he should be good.

1032
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,150
这是什么鬼地方？
What timezone is this?

1033
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,440
起来了！走！
Come on. Come on.

1034
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:09,680
- 美国队长  - 郎先生
- Captain America. - Mr. Lang.

1035
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:13,350
这是一种荣誉 我握你的手时间太长
It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long.

1036
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:15,930
哇 这太棒了 美国队长
Wow. This is awesome. Captain America.

1037
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:18,250
我认识你，你也不错的
I know you too, you're great.

1038
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,680
天呐
Jeez.

1039
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,080
听着，我想说
Look, I wanted to say.

1040
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:26,950
我知道你知道很多叼炸天的人，所以...
I know you know a lot of super people, so...

1041
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,250
感谢邀请我来
Thanks for thinking of me.

1042
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,620
- 嗨，老兄  - 嗨，小子
- Hey, man. - What's up tic-tac.

1043
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,010
很高兴见到你 看 上次那次...（指的是蚁人中猎鹰被蚁人完虐）
Good to see you. Look. What happened last time was a...

1044
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,400
那次是一个不错初面，但它......它永远不会再发生
It was a great audition, but it'll... it'll never happen again.

1045
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,600
他有没有告诉你我们的敌人是谁了？
Did he tell you what we're up against?

1046
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:43,200
好像是一些精神有问题的杀手
Something about some... psycho assassins.

1047
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:45,520
你和我们在一起，你就是触犯法律了
We're outside the law on this one.

1048
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:47,970
所以，如果你和我们一起去，你就成为一名通缉犯
So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.

1049
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,540
嗯啊，要不然还能成为 ？
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1050
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,720
- 我们应该动起来了  - 有一辆直升机来了
- We should get moving. - I got a chopper lining up.

1051
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:59,170
他们在撤离机场
They're evacuating the airport.

1052
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,630
- 斯塔克  - 斯塔克？
- Stark. - Stark?

1053
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,340
武装起来
Suit up.

1054
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:26,840
哇，这太奇怪了，你怎么碰上的老熟人在机场
Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport.

1055
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:28,700
- 难道你不觉得不可思议？ - 绝对不可思议
- Don't you just feel weird? - Definitely weird.

1056
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,940
听我说完，托尼
Hear me out, Tony.

1057
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:33,950
那医生，心理医生，他是幕后黑手
That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.

1058
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:39,350
- 队长  - 殿下
- Captain. - Your highness.

1059
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,670
无论如何
Anyway.

1060
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,930
罗斯给了我36小时带你进去
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.

1061
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,760
已经过了24小时
That was 24 hours ago.

1062
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:47,320
- 你能帮一下兄弟吗？ - 你们抓错人了
- Can you help a brother out? - You're after the wrong guy.

1063
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,660
你的判断颠倒是非
Your judgment is askew.

1064
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:52,060
你的战友打死昨天无辜的人
Your war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.

1065
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,030
还有5个超级士兵和他一样
And there are 5 more super soldiers just like him.

1066
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,660
我不能让医生在我们之前找到那些士兵，托尼 我不能
I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.

1067
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,160
史蒂夫
Steve.

1068
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:02,220
你知道即将发生的事情
You know, what's about to happen.

1069
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,340
你真的想杀出一条血路吗？
Do you really want to punch your way out of this one?

1070
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:10,750
好吧，我已经失去耐心
All right, I've run out of patience.

1071
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:12,500
小屁孩！
Underoos!

1072
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,720
做得好，孩子
Nice job, kid.

1073
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,860
谢谢 好吧，我应该降落更好一点
Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better.

1074
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:22,150
这...因为新衣服不太适应......
It's... just the new suit...

1075
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:24,610
恩，没什么大不了，斯塔克先生，衣服挺好的，谢谢
Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark It's-It's perfect, thank you.

1076
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,260
是嘛，我们不需要在这里细聊
Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.

1077
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,720
好的 队..队长
Okay. Cap... Captain.

1078
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:30,350
我是你的大粉丝，我是蜘蛛侠
Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.

1079
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,120
是吗，我晚点会谈论它 只是...
Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just...

1080
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,100
- 嘿大家  - ... 做得好
- Hey, everyone. - ... good job.

1081
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,120
- 你一直很忙  - 你一直就是个白痴
- You've been busy. - And you've been a complete idiot.

1082
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,310
拉上克林特
Dragging in Clint.

1083
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:40,480
把旺达从她不想离开的地方拉出来
Rescuing Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave.

1084
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,620
安全的地方 我试图保持....
A safe place. I'm trying to keep....

1085
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:47,780
我试图让你从分裂复仇者联盟
I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.

1086
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,150
你签署协议的时候就已经撕裂了
You did that when you signed.

1087
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:52,980
好吧，我说完了
Alright, I'm done.

1088
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:55,350
你过要去抓住巴恩斯还有你会和我们一起去
You're gonna turn Barnes over and you're gonna come with us.

1089
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,510
现在！因为我们是一个团队！
NOW! Because it's us!

1090
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:01,650
我们是总统的特别行动小组，伙计们，没有关于不礼貌的内疚
We're squaded JSOC, guys, with no compunction about being impolite.

1091
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:07,500
我们创立了它
We found it.

1092
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:11,940
飞机在左边第五北跑道
The quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.

1093
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,880
Alright，郎
Alright, Lang.

1094
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,240
大家好
Hey, guys. Something...

1095
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:20,950
哇 什么，到底是什么？
Whoa. What-What the hell was that?

1096
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:22,850
我相信这是你的了，美国队长
I believe this is yours, Captain America.

1097
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,370
哦，太好了 好吧，有两个在停机坪上
Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck.

1098
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,480
其中之一是Maximoff，我会抓住她
One of them is Maximoff, I'm going to grab her.

1099
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:28,670
Rhodey，你想拿下队长？
Rhodey, you want to take Cap?

1100
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:30,920
有两个在那边 威尔逊和巴恩斯
Got two in the terminal. Wilson and Barnes.

1101
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,800
巴恩斯是我的！
Barnes is mine!

1102
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,670
嘿，斯塔克先生，我该怎么办？
Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?

1103
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,700
像我们之前讨论的 保持距离 网起他们
What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web em up.

1104
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:38,530
好的，收到！
Okay, copy that!

1105
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,600
走开，队长
Move, Captain.

1106
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:47,170
我不会再问第二次
I won't ask a second time.

1107
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:52,880
- 你看，我真的不想伤害你  - 我不会强调这件事
- Look, I really don't want to hurt you. - I wouldn't stress about it.

1108
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:08,540
- 这是什么东西？ - 每个人的现在得到一个噱头
- What the hell was that? - Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1109
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:18,310
你有一个金属的手臂？这是真棒，伙计！
You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!

1110
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,910
你有权保持沉默的权利！
You have the right to remain silent!

1111
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:39,060
对不起，队长 这不会杀你，但它也不会让你挠痒
Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1112
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:46,940
- 旺达，我觉得你受伤了幻视的感受  - 你把我锁在房间
- Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings. - You locked me in my room.

1113
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:48,810
好的 首先，这是一个夸张
Okay. First, that's an exaggeration.

1114
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:51,000
其次，我这样做是为了保护你
Second, I did it to protect you.

1115
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:52,640
- 嘿，克林特  - 嗨，老兄
- Hey, Clint. - Hey, man.

1116
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:56,130
显然，退休不适合你，厌倦了打高尔夫？
Clearly retirement doesn't suit you, get tired of shooting golf?

1117
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:59,300
好吧，我打18杆，结果18杆全中
Well, I played 18, I shot 18.

1118
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,720
好像不能不中
Just can't seem to miss.

1119
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:06,560
- 第一次做的一切  - 让你看
- First time for everything. - Made you look.

1120
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:20,570
- 发现多处挫伤  - 是啊，我发现这一点
- Multiple contusions detected. - Yeah, I detected that too.

1121
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,090
噢 上帝啊
Oh god.

1122
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:32,390
嘿，伙计，我想你漏了这个！
Hey buddy, I think you lost this!

1123
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,320
- 那些是翅膀的碳纤维？ - 难道这东西出来的吗？
- Are those wings carbon fiber? - Is this stuff coming out of you?

1124
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:48,430
这可以解释的这东西刚性和灵活性
That would explain the rigidity flexibility ratio

1125
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:50,100
不得不说，这真棒
which, gotta say, that's awesome man.

1126
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,620
我不知道如果你以前打过仗没 
I don’t know if you’ve been a fight before

1127
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:55,360
- 但通常没有这么多说话  - 好吧，对不起，是我不好
- but there's usually not this much talking. - Alright, sorry, my bad.

1128
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:01,080
伙计们，看看 我喜欢这样保持下去
Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up

1129
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,840
但我今天只有一个任务，今天在这里我要让斯塔克先生刮目相看
but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,

1130
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:06,430
所以，我真的很抱歉  
so, I’m really sorry.

1131
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:09,540
Wwahhhh！
Wwahhhh !

1132
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,920
你不可能早点做到吗？
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1133
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:14,090
我恨你
I hate you.

1134
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,840
队长，打起精神来！
Captain, heads up!

1135
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:25,960
在朝着这个扔它
Throw it at this.

1136
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:27,370
快点！
Now!

1137
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:32,560
不是吧！
Oh, come on!

1138
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:37,690
天啊 我认为这是一个水车
Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck.

1139
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:40,040
嗯对不起
Uh... sorry.

1140
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:43,970
好吧 现在，我生气
Alright. Now, I'm pissed.

1141
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:45,590
这是该计划的一部分？
Is this, part of the plan?

1142
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:49,050
好了，我的计划是去温柔对他们 现在要强硬一点了
Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You want to switch it up?

1143
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,840
那是我们的飞机
There's our ride.

1144
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,780
来啊！
Come on!

1145
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:06,180
罗杰斯队长
Captain Rogers.

1146
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:10,050
我知道你相信你在做什么是正确的
I know you believe what you're doing is right.

1147
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:14,840
但是，对于集体利益，必须立即投降
But, for the collective good, you must surrender now.

1148
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:33,430
我们该怎么办，队长？
What do we do, Cap?

1149
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,840
我们战斗
We fight.

1150
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:39,400
这是不会有好下场
This isn't going to end well.

1151
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,200
他们不会停止
They're not stopping.

1152
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:48,820
我们也是，
Neither are we.

1153
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:22,840
- 我们仍然是朋友，不是吗？ - 取决于你打我多用力
- We're still friends, right? - Depends on how hard you hit me.

1154
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:33,140
你放水了
You're pulling your punches.

1155
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:40,580
- 我没有杀死你的父亲  - 那你为什么跑？
- I didn't kill your father. - Then why did you run?

1156
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:49,430
接招吧
Take that!

1157
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,350
那东西不服从物理定律的
That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.

1158
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:02,500
小屁孩 有很多事情在这里，你不明白
Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.

1159
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,390
斯塔克说你会这么说
Stark said you'd say that.

1160
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:16,250
他还表示，攻击你的腿
He also said to go for your legs.

1161
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:29,440
克林特，你可以让他离开我吗？
Clint, can you get him off me?

1162
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:32,080
- 抓稳了吗？ - 啊，还没抓稳
- Grapple in? - Yeah. No, I'm good.

1163
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:34,870
我很好，射箭的家伙 出发吧 出发吧！
I'm good, arrow-guy. Let's go. Let's go!

1164
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:57,210
斯塔克有没有告诉你什么吗？
Did Stark tell you anything else?

1165
01:36:57,230 --> 01:37:00,420
那就是你就错了 你以为你是对的
That you're wrong. You think you're right.

1166
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:02,550
这使你变得很危险了
And that makes you dangerous.

1167
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,120
我猜他说的不无道理
I guess he had a point.

1168
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,480
你很有热情，孩子 你从哪里来？
You got heart, kid. Where're you from?

1169
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:18,130
皇后区
Queens.

1170
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,570
布鲁克林
Brooklyn.

1171
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:28,720
- 周五？ - 我们有一些武器系统下线
- Friday? - We have some weapon systems offline.

1172
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:29,780
啥？
They what?

1173
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:32,260
哦，你得拿去店里修修了
Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.

1174
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:35,700
- 谁在讲话？ - 这是你的良心
- Who's speaking? - It's your conscience.

1175
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:37,650
我们很久没聊天了
We don't talk a lot these days.

1176
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:38,970
周五
Friday?

1177
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:42,940
哦，哦
Oh oh.

1178
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,020
天啦...
Oh boy.

1179
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:56,950
- 我们得走了  - 那家伙现在可能是在西伯利亚
- We got to go. - That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1180
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,520
我要挡住所有会飞的
I'm gonna draw all the fliers.

1181
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,140
我对付幻视 你去飞机那边
I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.

1182
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:03,740
不，你们去飞机那！你们俩！
No, you get to the jet! Both of you!

1183
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:06,920
我们其余的人都不会离开这里
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1184
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:09,690
虽然我不愿意承认多，如果我们要赢得这场之一，
As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one,

1185
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,370
我们中的一些可能会牺牲
some of us might have to lose it.

1186
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,770
这不是真打，史蒂夫
This isn't the real fight, Steve.

1187
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:18,400
- 好吧，山姆，有什么计划？ - 我们需要用障眼法，一件大的东西分散注意

Right?

1319
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:53,610
它不是用来指我，还是山姆或旺达
It ain't used to mean me, or Sam, or Wanda.

1320
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:56,670
- 但是，我们在这里  - 因为你违反了法律
- But, here we are. - 'Cause you broke the law.

1321
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:58,720
- 是啊  - 我没强迫你
- Yeah. - I didn't make you.

1322
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:01,060
- 法律 法律  - 你知法犯法了
- The law. The law. - You read it, you broke it.

1323
01:53:01,090 --> 01:53:02,120
法律 法律 法律
The law. The law. The law.

1324
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:05,010
好吧，你都这么大了 你有老婆孩子
Alright, you're all grown ups. You got a wife and kids.

1325
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:08,740
我听不懂 你为什么不想想他们，当你选择了错误的一方吗？
I don't understand. Why didn't you think about them before you choose the wrong side?

1326
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:11,880
你最好小心这个家伙了
You better watch your back on this guy.

1327
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,910
他很有可能去破坏
Chances are he's going to break it.

1328
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,970
汉克·皮姆总是说，你永远不可以信任斯塔克
Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.

1329
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:21,880
你是谁？
Who are you?

1330
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:24,260
得了吧，伙计
Come on, man.

1331
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:26,850
怎么样罗德？
How's Rhodes?

1332
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,450
我们明天打算飞到他的哥伦比亚医疗
We're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow.

1333
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:31,840
所以......祈祷吧
So... Fingers cross.

1334
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:35,040
你需要什么？他们喂你吃了吗？
What do you need? They feed you yet?

1335
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:38,500
你现在在唱红脸咯？
You're the good cop now?

1336
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,390
我什么脸都不唱，我要知道队长去哪里了
I'm just a guy who needs to know where Steve went.

1337
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:42,230
好吧，那你最好去找一个黑脸，
Well, you better go get a bad cop,

1338
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:44,130
因为你在我身上
because you would have to go Mark 'Terminal' on my ass

1339
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:46,470
一点信息都得不到
to get information out of me.

1340
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,770
哦，我现在暂时干扰了他们的监控
Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'.

1341
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:52,340
还有30秒就会恢复正常
We got about 30 seconds before they realized it's not their equipment.

1342
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:55,600
你做了什么？回来！
What did you do? Get it back up!

1343
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:58,100
听着
Just look.

1344
01:53:58,450 --> 01:54:03,180
这个是询问巴恩斯的家伙
Because that is the fellow who is suppose to interrogate Barnes.

1345
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:06,270
很显然，我犯了一个错误 山姆，我错了
Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.

1346
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:07,740
这是首回
That's a first.

1347
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:12,210
队长绝对是在重要关头，所以他是需要帮助
Cap is definitely off the reservation and he's about to need all the help he can get.

1348
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,030
我们不太熟 你不必...
We don't know each other very well. You don't have to...

1349
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:16,200
嘿 没关系
Hey. It's alright.

1350
01:54:23,970 --> 01:54:25,860
好吧，我会告诉你
Look, I will tell you.

1351
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:29,530
但是你必须单独一个人去，以朋友的身份去
But you have to go alone and as a friend.

1352
01:54:30,650 --> 01:54:32,200
吁~~~
Easy.

1353
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,640
斯塔克，他刚才和你说了罗杰斯的下落吗？
Stark, did he give you anything on Rogers?

1354
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:40,160
不，他叫我去吃翔 我要回我的大厦
No, he told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead.

1355
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:43,290
但是，你可以随时打电话给我
But, you can call me anytime.

1356
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:46,240
我会搁置你的电话，我喜欢看行闪烁
I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink.

1357
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:56,050
你还记得那个时候我们骑着
You remember that time we had to ride back from

1358
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,320
在洛克威海滩跟着冷冻卡车后面？
Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?

1359
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:01,990
那个时候我们用火车资金的买热狗？
Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?

1360
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:06,000
你就想3块钱就试图赢得了毛绒熊给那个红头发的妹子
You blew 3 bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1361
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:09,060
- 是她叫什么名字来着？ - 多洛雷斯 你叫她
- What was her name again? - Dolores. You called her Da.

1362
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:10,980
她现在应该有100多岁了
She's got to be a hundred years old by now.

1363
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:13,130
我们也是如此，伙计
So are we, pal.

1364
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:23,990
他应该几小时前才到这里
He can't have been here more than a few hours.

1365
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:26,180
已经有足够长的时间来唤醒他们
Long enough to wake them up.

1366
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:09,490
走吧
You ready?

1367
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:11,050
恩
Yeah.

1368
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,550
你看起来充满敌意
You seem more defensively.

1369
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,280
今天经历太多了
It's been a long day.

1370
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:31,220
淡定，士兵 我目标不是你
At ease, soldier. I'm not currently after you.

1371
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:33,340
那么你为什么在这里？
Then why are you here?

1372
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:35,980
也许，你的故事没那么疯狂了
Maybe, your story is not so crazy.

1373
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,130
或许吧
Maybe.

1374
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:42,160
罗斯不知道我在这里，我想保持这种方式
Ross has no idea I'm here, I like to keep it that way.

1375
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:45,560
否则，我得自己逮捕自己
Otherwise, I got to arrest myself.

1376
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:48,670
嗯，这听起来你有很多报告要写
Well, that sounds like a lot of paper work.

1377
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:54,790
- 这是很高兴见到你，托尼  - 我也是，队长
- It's good to see you, Tony. - Me too, Cap.

1378
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:57,230
满洲候选人，你玩死我了
Manchurian candidate, you're killing me.

1379
01:57:57,260 --> 01:57:59,950
有一个休战这里，你可以放下来
There's a truce here, you can drop it.

1380
01:58:19,410 --> 01:58:22,380
- 热能扫描  - 多少个敌人？
- I got heat signatures. - How many?

1381
01:58:23,150 --> 01:58:25,770
呃，一个
Uh, one.

1382
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:48,420
他们都在梦中已经舒适地死去
If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.

1383
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:57,800
你真的认为我想要更多的冬兵吗？
Did you really think I wanted more of you?

1384
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:00,970
什么鬼东西？
What the hell?

1385
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:06,680
我很感谢他们，因为他们把你带到这里
I'm grateful to them though, they brought you here.

1386
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:12,260
队长，请
Please, Captain.

1387
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:15,280
苏联建立了这个墙能够承受的万吨冲击
The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of

1388
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:17,120
百颗火箭的轰炸
a few a 100 rockets.

1389
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:19,000
我敢打赌我可以打穿
I'm betting I can beat that.

1390
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:21,340
哦，我敢肯定你可以，斯塔克先生
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark.

1391
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:23,130
如果你有时间
Given time.

1392
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:25,120
但你永远不会知道你为什么来了
But then you'll never know why you came.

1393
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:28,480
你杀了在维也纳无辜的人只是把我们带到这里？
You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?

1394
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:38,620
我花了整整一年什么也没干
I thought about nothing else for over a year.

1395
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:43,280
那一年我就研究你，我 你
I studied you, I followed you.

1396
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:47,320
但现在，你站在这里，我才意识到......
But now that you are standing here, I just realized...

1397
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:52,660
你的蓝色的眼睛有点绿色
There's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes.

1398
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,940
找到一个缺陷真好
How nice to find a flaw.

1399
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:59,150
你是塞科维亚人？
You're Sokovian.

1400
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:01,500
你是为了报仇？
Is that what this is about?

1401
02:00:01,530 --> 02:00:05,030
就算你们没在那大战，塞科维亚迟早都是一个陷落的国家
Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell.

1402
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:06,560
不
No.

1403
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:10,730
我来这里是因为我做了一个承诺
I'm here because I made a promise.

1404
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:15,910
你已经失去了一个人
You've lost someone.

1405
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:21,710
我已经失去了所有人
I've lost everyone.

1406
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:24,900
你也会
And so will you.

1407
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:29,100
1991年12月16日
16 December 1991

1408
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:34,840
一个在外部力量摧毁的帝国可以崛起
An empire topple by its enemies can rise again.

1409
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:38,040
但是一个内部分裂的帝国.
But one which crumples from within...

1410
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:40,830
将永远灭亡
that's dead

1411
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:43,440
...永远
... forever.

1412
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:53,220
我知道这条道路
I know that road.

1413
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,540
16 December 1991 [ 16 December 1991 ]

1414
02:00:55,570 --> 02:00:57,410
这是什么？
What is this?

1415
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:21,520
帮助我的妻子
Help my wife.

1416
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:25,290
请帮她
Please. Help her.

1417
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,550
巴恩斯
Sergeant Barnes.

1418
02:01:33,170 --> 02:01:34,940
霍华德中士！
Howard.

1419
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:43,870
霍华德中士！
Howard!

1420
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:04,760
救我.
Help.

1421
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,430
托尼 托尼
Tony. Tony.

1422
02:02:31,390 --> 02:02:33,200
你知道吗？
Did you know?

1423
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,400
我不知道是他
I didn't know it was him.

1424
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:39,970
别废话了我，罗杰斯！你知道吗？
Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?

1425
02:02:43,330 --> 02:02:44,880
说
Yes.

1426
02:03:40,730 --> 02:03:42,440
离开！
Get out of here!

1427
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:55,610
这是不是他，托尼 九头蛇控制了他的大脑！
It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had controlled of his mind!

1428
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:56,820
滚开！
Move!

1429
02:03:56,850 --> 02:03:58,340
不是他
It wasn't him!

1430
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,810
左启动喷射失败
Left boot-jet failing.

1431
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,310
飞行系统受到损害
Flight systems compromised.

1432
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:13,190
那不是废话
Ain't that a crap.

1433
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:28,730
他是不会停止 走
He's not going to stop. Go.

1434
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:53,990
- 来吧 来吧  - 瞄准系统不准确的，老板
- Come on. Come on. - Targeting systems inaccurate, Boss.

1435
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:55,650
我用人眼瞄准
I'm eye balling it.

1436
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:15,560
你还记得他们吗？
Do you even remember them?

1437
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:17,770
我记得他们
I remember all of them.

1438
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:42,240
这是不会改变的发生了什么
This isn't going to change what happened.

1439
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:46,260
我不在乎 他杀了我妈
I don't care. He killed my mom.

1440
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:50,240
你应该已经看到了他的小脸 再试试，好吗？
You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay?

1441
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:54,220
我去睡觉了 爱你
I'm going to bed. I love you.

1442
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:04,700
我差点杀错了人
I almost kill the wrong man.

1443
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:07,860
杀错一个无辜的人
Hardly an innocent one.

1444
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:10,010
这是你想要的吗？
Is this what you wanted?

1445
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:13,250
看到他们内部四分五裂
To see them ripped each other apart.

1446
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:19,860
我父亲住在城外
My father lived outside the city.

1447
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:23,070
我以为我们在那里会是安全的
I thought we would be safe there.

1448
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:25,410
我的儿子很兴奋
My son was excited.

1449
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:28,750
他可以从车窗外看到了钢铁侠
He could see the Iron Man from the car window.

1450
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:32,630
我告诉我的妻子，“别担心 ”
And I told my wife, "Don't worry."

1451
02:07:32,650 --> 02:07:36,980
“他们是战斗在城市，我们离那里有几公里“
"They are fighting in the city. We are miles from harm."

1452
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:44,900
当尘埃落定，尖叫停止
When the dust cleared, and the screaming stopped.

1453
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:49,880
我花了两天时间找到他们的尸体
It took me two days after I found their bodies.

1454
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:53,320
我的父亲
My father...

1455
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:58,010
还握着我的妻子和儿子在他的怀里
still holding my wife and son in his arms.

1456
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:03,960
然而复仇者联盟...
And the Avengers...

1457
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:06,800
他们就回家了
they went home.

1458
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,980
我知道我不能杀了他们
I knew I couldn't kill them.

1459
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,030
比我还厉害的人都试过了
More powerful men than me have tried.

1460
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:18,960
但是，如果我可以让他们互相残杀？
But, if I could get them to kill each other?

1461
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:25,130
我对你的父亲的事情感到难过
I'm sorry about your father.

1462
02:08:25,690 --> 02:08:27,750
他似乎是个好人
He seemed a good man.

1463
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:31,750
有你这样一个孝子
With a dutiful son.

1464
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:38,500
复仇已经吞噬了你
Vengeance has consumed you.

1465
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:42,280
复仇已经吞噬了他们
It's consuming them.

1466
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:49,230
我不会让这吞噬了我
I'm not letting it consume me.

1467
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:55,200
公义会到来
Justice will come soon enough.

1468
02:08:57,750 --> 02:08:59,780
和那些死去的人说吧
Tell that to the dead.

1469
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:06,960
那些活的人还没和你算账呢
The living are not done with you yet.

1470
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:12,250
你不能击败他肉搏
You can't beat him hand to hand.

1471
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:15,130
分析他的战斗模式
Analyse his fighting pattern.

1472
02:09:15,150 --> 02:09:16,810
4 扫描
Scanning!

1473
02:09:20,610 --> 02:09:22,570
对策准备
Countermeasures ready.

1474
02:09:23,690 --> 02:09:25,460
打到他落花流水
Let's kick his ass.

1475
02:09:38,440 --> 02:09:40,600
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

1476
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:42,360
我也是
So was I.

1477
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:51,280
停手 最后的警告
Stay down. Final warning.

1478
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:07,220
我能这样打一天
I can do this all day.

1479
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:15,590
那个盾不属于你
That shield does not belong to you.

1480
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:21,570
你不值得了！我父亲制作了那个盾！
You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!

1481
02:11:57,100 --> 02:11:58,800
早八晚五吃饭
Meals at eight and five.

1482
02:11:58,830 --> 02:12:01,490
马桶特权，每天两次
Toilet privileges, twice a day.

1483
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:05,740
大声点，攻击
Raise your voice, zap.

1484
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:08,020
触摸玻璃，攻击
Touch the glass, zap.

1485
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,240
你越线了，你对付我
You step out of line, you deal with me.

1486
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:13,480
麻烦一下，越线了 嗯？
Please, step out of line. Hm?

1487
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:16,500
觉得如何？
So, how's it feel?

1488
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:19,660
花所有的时间，所有的努力
Spending all that time, all that effort.

1489
02:12:20,230 --> 02:12:24,310
而且，你计划失败，
And, you scheme fail,

1490
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:27,170
失败的一塌涂地
so spectacularly.

1491
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:32,060
是吗？
Did it?

1492
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:59,280
- 这只是第一次测试  - 是啊
- That's just a first test. - Yeah.

1493
02:12:59,310 --> 02:13:01,540
给我一些反馈 任何你能想到的
Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of.

1494
02:13:01,570 --> 02:13:04,850
减震 横向运动
Shock absorption. Lateral movement.

1495
02:13:05,050 --> 02:13:06,260
杯架？
Cup holder?

1496
02:13:06,290 --> 02:13:08,910
不，我想在下面装空调
No, I'm thinking about some AC down there.

1497
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:12,760
我们走吧 我帮帮你
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1498
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:15,020
不，不，不 别帮我 别帮我
No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me.

1499
02:13:30,610 --> 02:13:35,310
138. 138作战任务
138. 138 combat missions.

1500
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,500
这是我飞过的次数，托尼
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1501
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,760
每一次都可能最后一次，但我都飞完了
Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew em.

1502
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:44,690
为了那些不得不战的战斗
To the fight needed to be fought.

1503
02:13:44,710 --> 02:13:46,790
这和协议一样
It's the same with these Accords.

1504
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:50,650
我签，因为这是应该做的正确的事情
I signed because it was the right thing to do.

1505
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:54,940
和，是啊，这很糟糕 这是...
And, yeah, this sucks. This is...

1506
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:57,510
这是一个坏事
This is a bad beat.

1507
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:02,050
但它并没有改变我的想法
But it hadn't change my mind.

1508
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:04,200
那你怎么看？
What do you think?

1509
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:16,620
- 你没事吧？ - 哦耶
- You okay? - Oh yeah.

1510
02:14:19,330 --> 02:14:22,200
你是托尼“大屎”？ （Stank臭屎，和Stark差一个字母，此处故意拼错作为一个梗）
Are you Tony "Stank"?

1511
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:26,660
没错，这就是 - 这是托尼“大屎”！你来对地方了
Yes, this is-this is Tony "Stank"! You're in the right place.

1512
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:28,580
谢谢你.
Thank you for that!

1513
02:14:28,610 --> 02:14:30,550
- 我从来没有拉屎  - 哦，天啊
- I'm never dropping that, by the way. - Oh my god.

1514
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:34,730
签这里，“大屎”先生 浴室这边请
Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.

1515
02:14:40,900 --> 02:14:42,390
Tony
Tony.

1516
02:14:42,740 --> 02:14:44,640
我很高兴你回到大厦
I'm glad you're back at the compound.

1517
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:48,070
我不喜欢你自己在大厦四处乱撞的样子
I don't like the idea of you rattling around in a mansion by yourself

1518
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:49,930
我们都需要的家庭
We all need family.

1519
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:54,810
和我比起来，复仇者联盟更像是你的家庭
The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine.

1520
02:14:55,290 --> 02:14:58,490
18岁以来，我一直孤身一人
I've been on my own since I was 18.

1521
02:14:58,650 --> 02:15:03,370
我从来没有真正适应任何地方 即使是在军队
I never really fit in anywhere. even in the army.

1522
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:10,060
我的命运在于......人，我想，每个人，
My fate's in... people, I guess. Individuals.

1523
02:15:10,270 --> 02:15:13,440
而且，我很高兴地说在大多数情况下，
And, I am happy to say for the most part,

1524
02:15:13,570 --> 02:15:15,560
他们没有让我失望
they haven't let me down.

1525
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:20,170
这就是为什么我不能让他们失望
Which is why I can't let them down either.

1526
02:15:23,650 --> 02:15:27,190
生命可以重来，但是，也许他们不行
Lives can be replaced, but, maybe they shouldn't.

1527
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,200
我知道我伤害了你，托尼
I know I hurt you, Tony.

1528
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:36,760
我想我不告诉你关于你的父母的事情是想让你过得好点，事实上，
I guessed I thought by not telling you about your parents, I was sparing you. But...

1529
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:40,080
我现在才明白，我是想让我自己过得好点
I can see now that I was really sparing myself.

1530
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:42,190
我十分抱歉
And I'm sorry.

1531
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:44,690
希望有一天你能理解
Hopefully one day you can understand.

1532
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:48,740
我想我们会在协定达成一致，我真的这样认为
I wished we'd agree on the Accords, I really do.

1533
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:50,220
我知道你在做你坚信的事情，
I know you're doing what you believe in.

1534
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:53,330
这是我们所有人都可以做 这也是是我们任何人应该做的
And that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should.

1535
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:55,510
从局长罗斯优先级呼叫
Priority call from Secretary Ross.

1536
02:15:55,530 --> 02:15:58,160
还有的是在监狱RAFT违约
There's been a breach at the RAFT prison.

1537
02:15:59,110 --> 02:16:00,870
好的，接通
Yeah, put him through.

1538
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:04,250
- 托尼，我们有大问题  - 啊，请稍等
- Tony, we have a problem. - Ah, please hold.

1539
02:16:04,270 --> 02:16:06,540
- 不，不！
No. Don't...

1540
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:10,290
所以，不管是什么
So, no matter what.

1541
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:14,050
我答应你，如果你需要我们，
I promise you, if you need us,

1542
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:16,580
如果你需要我，
if you need me,

1543
02:16:21,430 --> 02:16:23,080
我会在那
I'll be there.

1544
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:29,510


1545
02:18:21,970 --> 02:18:23,860
你确定吗？
You sure about this?

1546
02:18:24,620 --> 02:18:27,260
我不能相信我自己的头脑
I can't trust my own mind.

1547
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:32,200
所以，直到他们弄清楚如何得到这个东西出来我的头
So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head

1548
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:35,040
我想回去下是最好的东西，
I think going back under is the best thing,

1549
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:37,470
... 为所有人
... for everybody.

1550
02:18:59,110 --> 02:19:01,190
感谢你为这个
Thank you for this.

1551
02:19:02,990 --> 02:19:05,250
您的朋友和我的父亲，
Your friend and my father,

1552
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:08,460
他们都是受害者
they are both victims.

1553
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:13,060
如果我能够帮助他们中的一个寻求和平...
If I can help one of them to find peace...

1554
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:18,180
要知道，如果他们发现他在这里，
You know, If they find out he's here,

1555
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:20,440
他们会来找他
they'll come for him.

1556
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:24,330
那就让他们试试
Then, let them try.

1557
02:19:35,970 --> 02:19:42,010
Aorion  - 通过创建字幕 -
Subtitle created by - Aorion -

1558
02:26:04,850 --> 02:26:07,920
所以 他是谁？谁打你？
So. Who was it? Who hit you?

1559

有些家伙

那么痒了，伙计 缝补
So itchy, man. Darn

1561
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:13,670
- 什么是某些人的名字？ - 嗯，史蒂夫
- What's some guy's name? - Uh, Steve.

1562
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:14,720
史蒂夫
Steve?

1563
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:16,260
哎呀！
Yikes.

1564
02:26:16,290 --> 02:26:17,470
难道他自己的自行车吗？
Does he own a bike?

1565
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:20,050
不不不 你不知道他，他是来自布鲁克林
No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn.

1566
02:26:22,830 --> 02:26:24,130
哎哟
Ouch...

1567
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:25,660
你好
Well.

1568
02:26:25,710 --> 02:26:27,410
希望你有几个好机会
Hope you got a few good licks in.

1569
02:26:27,450 --> 02:26:29,460
是啊，我得到了真正不少
Yeah, I got quite a few in actually.

1570
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,520
好的
Okay.

1571
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:34,320
他的朋友是巨大的 像巨大的
His friend was huge. Like huge.

1572
02:26:36,250 --> 02:26:38,490
这太好了 谢谢
That's way better. Thank you.

1573
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:40,770
好吧，硬汉
Okay, tough guy.

1574
02:26:43,470 --> 02:26:46,800
爱你，梅婶婶 嘿，你可以关上了门
Love you, Aunt May. Hey, can you shut the door.

1575
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:05,150
蜘蛛侠将返回
Spider-Man will return
