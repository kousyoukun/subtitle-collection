00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,480
天哪  这缩写还得好好想想
God, I got to work on that acronym.

144
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,150
一种极其昂贵的通过控制海马体
An extremely costly method, of hijacking the hippocampus

145
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,650
清除创伤记忆的手段
to clear... traumatic memories.

146
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,570
这无法改变
It doesn't change the fact

147
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,430
他们根本没能到达机场的事实
that they never made it to the airport,

148
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,850
或是我为了逃避悲伤所做的那些事  但是
or the things I did to avoid processing my grief. But...

149
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,610
再者  我这个治疗实验花费了6.11亿美元
Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment.

150
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,260
任何一个正常人都不会赞助这个项目
No one in their right mind would ever funded it.

151
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,110
提醒我一下  麻省理工的宗旨是什么
Help me out. What's the MIT mission statement.

152
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,630
创造  传播和保护知识
To generate, disseminate and preserve knowledge,

153
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,290
与他人协作
and work with others,

154
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,420
尽全力去挑战世界的极限
to bring to bear on the world's great challenges.

155
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,740
你们  就是他人
Well, you, are the others.

156
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,650
尽管没有大肆宣传  你们所面临的挑战
And quiet as it's kept the challenges facing you

157
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,660
也是人类所遭遇的严峻的
are the greatest mankind has ever known.

158
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,500
另外  你们大多数都破产了
Plus, most of you are broke.

159
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,780
或者说  你们之前是
Also, rather you were.

160
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,960
即刻生效  在座各位都将得到
As of this moment, every student has been made an equal recipient

161
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,110
九月基金的拨款
of the inaugural September Foundation Grant.

162
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,550
就是说  你们所有人的项目都得到批准资助了
As in, all of your projects have just been approved and funded.

163
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,540
没有附加条款  不收税
No strings. No taxes.

164
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,330
放手去  改变未来吧
Just... reframe the future.

165
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,140
从现在开始
Starting now.

166
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,240
<b>现在我要请出基金负责人  派珀·波茨</b>

167
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,030
别怕犯错  放手做吧
Go break some eggs.

168
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,510
我简直  真是要窒息了
That uh... That took my breathe away.

169
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,430
托尼  太慷慨了  那么多钱
Tony, so generous, so much money.

170
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,600
我出于好奇问一句
I... Out of curiosity and...

171
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,480
拨款会有一部分给教职工吗
Will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty?

172
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,950
我知道  真没品  但听我说
I know, ew, gross, but hear me out.

173
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,310
我有个关于自熟热狗的绝妙点子
I have got this killer idea for a self cooking hotdog.

174
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,650
基本上就是嵌入化学引燃剂
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...

175
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,630
洗手间在这边吗
Restroom's this way, yeah?

176
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,780
是的  嵌在肉架中
Yeah. Embedding in the meat shaft.

177
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,210
斯塔克先生  提词器的事很抱歉
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the telepromter.

178
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,670
我不知道波茨女士不来了
I didn't know Miss Potts has canceled.

179
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,290
他们没来得及改
They didn't have time to fix it.

180
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,310
这
It's...

181
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
没事  我马上回来
fine. I..I..I'll be right back.

182
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,600
我们等下再聊
We'll catch up later.

183
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,990
你为那些年轻人做的事真是不错
That was nice, what you did for those young people.

184
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,340
他们应得的
Oh, they deserve it.

185
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
也让我的良心好过些
Plus it helps ease my conscious.

186
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,870
据说慷慨与内疚是有关联的
They say, there's a correlation between generosity and guilt.

187
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,500
但你有的是钱
But, you got the money.

188
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,500
可以尽情犯错
Break as many eggs as you like.

189
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,680
对吧
Right?

190
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,820
你要上去吗
Are you going up?

191
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,860
我就想待在这里
I'm right where I want to be.

192
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,580
行了  别动
Okay, okay.

193
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,990
对不起  职业病
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.

194
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,320
我在国务院工作  人力资源部
I work for the State department. Human resources.

195
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,250
我知道这很无聊
I know it's boring.

196
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,900
但这让我能养活我的儿子
But, it enabled me to raise a son.

197
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,220
我很为他的成长骄傲
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.

198
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,990
他叫查理·斯宾塞
His name was Charlie Spencer.

199
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,540
你杀了他
Your murdered him.

200
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,500
在索科威亚
In Sokovia.

201
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,240
当然  这对你来说毫不重要
Not that that matters in the least to you.

202
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,350
你以为你为我们而战
You think you fight for us?

203
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,230
其实你只是为自己
You just fight for yourself.

204
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,620
谁会为我儿子复仇  斯塔克
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

205
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,070
他死了  都怪你
He's dead. And I blame you.

206
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,170
上月  在尼日利亚拉各斯  11名瓦坎达公民
11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation

207
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,540

在复仇者联盟与雇佣兵的冲突中
between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries

208

in Lagos, Nigeria, last month.

210

were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.

213
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,200
瓦坎达国王特查卡要求问责复仇者联盟
我国人民的鲜血洒在了外国领土上
Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil.

214
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,840
不仅是因为犯罪行为
Not only because of the actions of criminals,

215
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,830
还因为阻止犯罪的人的冷漠
but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them.

216
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,430
牺牲无辜者取得的胜利  根本算不上胜利
Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.

217
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,310
瓦坎达国王接着...
The Wakanda King went on to...

218
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,330
他们不受国际法的限制
They are operating outside and above the international law.

219
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,680
如果我们不回应此类行为  就会变成这样
Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.

220
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,160

Then turn the TV back on, they're being very specific.

224
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,250
我早该拆除那件炸弹背心
I should've clocked that bomb vest

225
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,140
而不是让你不得不动手

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,250
朗姆洛提到"巴基"

All of a sudden, I was a 16 year old kid again in Brooklyn.

228

我们尽可能救下更多的人
We try to save as many people as we can.

232
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,110
有时并不能救每个人
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody,

233
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,200
但如果我们无法接受这一点
but, if we can't find a way to live with that,

Vis, we talked about this.

Yes. But the door was opened so I assumed that...

238

罗杰斯队长说斯塔克先生回来让我通知他
Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.

国务卿
The Secretary of State.

244

五年前  我心脏病发作
5 years ago, I had a heart attack.

245
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,790
打高尔夫球后挥杆时昏了过去
and dropped right in the middle of my backswing.

246
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,760
结果  那成了我人生最大的幸事
Turned out, it was the best round of my life

247
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,960
因为经历了13小时的手术和三重搭桥术之后
because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass.

248
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,920
我发现了四十年军队生涯没教过我的东西
I found something 40 years in the army never taught me:

虽然有很多人把你们当成英雄
But while a great many people see you as heroes.

更愿意用"义务警员"这个词
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."

256
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,380
你会用哪个词  国务卿先生
And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary.

257
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,900
"危险"怎么样
How about "dangerous?"

258
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,420
你会如何形容一群驻扎在美国的能力增强者
What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals,

259
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,180
习惯性地无视主权国家边界
who routinely ignores sovereign borders

260
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,520
去哪  做什么  全凭自己意愿
and inflict their will wherever they choose

261
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,020
而且老实说  对造成的后果也似乎毫不关心
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind.

262
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,550
纽约

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,320
而是
Instead,

277
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,930
要在一个联合国小组的监督下行动
they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations Panel,

278
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,630
且是否出动要由该小组决定
only when and if that Panel deems it necessary.

279
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,320
复仇者联盟的成立是为了让世界更安全
The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place.

280
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,180
我觉得我们做到了
I feel we've done that.

281
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,640
队长  你知道托尔和班纳现在在哪吗
Tell me Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?

282
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,290
我要是搞丢了两个30兆吨级的核武器
If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes,

283
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,570
肯定会有后果
you can bet there'd be consequences.

284
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,340
妥协  保证  世界就是这样运转的
Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works.

285
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,530
相信我  这就是中间立场
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

286
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,350
有应急预案的吧
So, there are contingencies.

287
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,700
三天后  联合国将在维也纳召开会议
3 days from now, the UN meets in Vienna

288
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,400
批准《协议》
to ratify the Accords.

289
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,610
你们好好谈谈吧
Well, talk it over.

290
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,310
要是我们的决定你不喜欢呢
And if we come to a decision you don't like?

291
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,020
那你们就退休
Then you retire.

292
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,900
<b>克利夫兰</b>

293
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,340

Hello?

294
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,620
外面停的是你的车吗
Is this your car out front?

295
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,280
我开到人行道上了
I jumped the kerb.

296
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,300
也许我们可以私了
Maybe we could, take care of it ourselves.

297
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,550
要是你想打电话叫警察
I mean, if you want to call the cops,

298
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,070
那也可以
that...that's okay too, I guess.

299
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,870
不
No.

300
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,930
不用叫警察
No cops.

301
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,280
谢谢
Thank you.

302

你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

310
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,300
神盾局陷落时
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell,

311
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,050
黑寡妇公布了九头蛇文件

有数百万页  大都加了密

很难破译
Not easy to decipher.

314
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,170
但是
But,

315
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,160
我有经验
I have experience.

316

也有耐心
And patience.

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,620
有这两样就什么都能做成
A man can do anything if he has those.

318
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,840
你想要什么

320
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,130
见鬼去吧
Go to hell.

321
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,360
九头蛇活该灰飞烟灭
Hydra deserves its place on the ashheap,

322
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,760
所以  我不介意杀你
so your death would not bother me.

323
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,790
但你不说  我就得用这本书
But I'd have to use this book,

324
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,560
和其他更血腥的手段  来找到我要的
and other bloodier methods to find what I need.

325
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,470
我并不想那样
I don't look forward to that.

326
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,880
而你的死  也只是保住了自尊
You'd only be dying for... your pride.

327
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,530
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

328
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,230
国务卿罗斯有一枚国会荣誉勋章

329
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,790
比你多一枚
which is one more than you have.

330
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,440
那么假设我们同意签字
So, let's say we agree to this thing.

331
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,430
政府过多久就会像追踪普通罪犯那样
How long does it gonna be before they LoJack us

332
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,540
追踪我们
like a bunch of common criminals?

333
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,010
117个国家要签这份协议
117 countries want to sign this.

334
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,450
117个  山姆
117, Sam,

335
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,620
你就完全不当回事吗
and you're just like, "No, that's cool. We got it."

336
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,030
你还要做多久两面派
How long are you gonna play both sides?

337
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,990
-我有个方程式  -这样就明白了
- I have an equation. - Oh, this will clear it up.

338
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,670
斯塔克先生宣布他是钢铁侠后的八年里
In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man,

00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:20,310
能力增强者的数量一直呈指数增长
the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially.

340
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,470
同一段时期里
And during the same period,

341
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,560
可能引发世界末日的事件数量
the number of potentially world-ending events

342
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,520
也在同时上升
has risen at a commensurate rate.

343
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,000
你是说  这是我们的错吗
You saying it's our fault?

344
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,340
我是说  这可能有因果关系
I'm saying there maybe a causality.

345
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,410
我们的超能力招来挑战
Our very strength invites challenge.

346
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,900
挑战激发冲突
Challenge incites conflict.

347
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,470
而冲突
And conflict...

348
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,230
会引发灾难
breeds catastrophe.

349
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,410
监管
Oversight.

350
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,880
是我们应该给予考虑的
Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.

351
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,850
说到点上了
Boom.

352
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,840
托尼  你安静得出奇啊
Tony, you're being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal.

353
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,320
因为他已经决定好了
It's because he's already made up his mind.

354
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,730
天呐  你真懂我
Boy, you know me so well.

355
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,850
实际上  是电磁头痛犯了
Actually, I'm nursing my electromagnetic headache.

356
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,780
所以我才沉默  队长
That's what's going on, Cap.

357
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,140
就是疼
It's just pain...

358
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,130
不舒服
it's discomfort.

359
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,640
是谁把咖啡渣倒进垃圾处理器了
Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal?

360
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,250
我是给机车党开了家旅馆吗
Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?

361
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,920
那是查尔斯·斯宾塞
Oh, that's Charles Spencer by the way.

362
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,660
是个好孩子  计算机工程专业
He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree.

363
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,630
平均成绩3.6
3.6 GPA.

364
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,520
计划秋天去因特尔基层上班
Had a floor-level gig at Intel planned for the fall.

365
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,170
但是  他想趁窝在办公室里之前
But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul,

366
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,900
先去积累阅历
before he park it behind a desk.

367
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,110
看看世界  做做义工
See the world, maybe be of service.

368
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,220
查理不想去维加斯或劳德尔堡
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale

369
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,010
要我就会选那些地方
which is what I would do.

370
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,920
也没去巴黎或阿姆斯特丹  那儿多有趣
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun.

371
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,980
他想利用暑假
He decided to spend his summer,

372
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,720
给穷人建生态住宅
building sustainable housing for the poor.

373
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,320
猜猜是哪  索科威亚
Guess where, Sokovia.

374
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,780
他可能是想做出些改变
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.

375
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,520
但我们无从得知了
I mean, we won't know

376
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,760
因为我们打得正高兴时
cause we dropped a building on him

377
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,510
向他身上砸了一栋楼
while we were kicking ass.

378
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,540
我们完全没有决策程序
There's no decision making process here.

379
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,360
我们需要受到管制
We need to be put in check.

380
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,160
不管以什么形式  我都接受
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

381
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,670
如果不受限制  我们就会无法无天
If we can't accept limitations, if we're bounderless,

382
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,050
比坏人好不到哪去
we're no better than the bad guys.

383
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,230
托尼  有人死在你眼皮下
Tony, someone dies on your watch,

384
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,770
你不能就此放弃
you don't give up.

385
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,650
谁说我们要放弃了
Who said we're giving up?

386
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,450
如果不对自己的行为负责  就是放弃
We are, for not taking responsibility for our actions.

387
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,090
这些文件只是在推卸责任
These documents just shifts the blames.

388
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,580
对不起  史蒂夫
I'm sorry, Steve, that...

389
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,930
这话自负得危险
That is dangerously arrogant.

390
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,980
这可是联合国啊
This is the United Nations we're talking about.

391
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,550
不是世界安全理事会
It's not the World Security Council,

392
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,920
不是神盾局  也不是九头蛇
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not Hydra.

393
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,940
对  但管理者仍是人  人有目的
No, but it's run by people with agendas

394
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,710
而目的会变
and agendas change.

395
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,710
那是好事  所以我才会在这儿
That's good. That's why I'm here.

396
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,600
当我意识到我的武器落入敌手
When I realized what my weapons were capable of

397
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,660
后果会多不堪设想时
in the wrong hands,

398
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,350
我就停止生产了
I shut it down, stopped manufacturing...

399
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,770
托尼  那是你的选择
Tony. You chose to do that.

400
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,280
如果我们签字  就放弃了选择权
If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose.

401
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,020
如果小组派我们去不该去的地方
What if this Panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go.

402
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,890
或是不许我们去该去的地方呢
What if there's somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us.

403
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,150
我们也许不完美  但仍是最可靠的人
We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.

404
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:06,340
如果现在不签  将来他们会强迫我们签
If we don't do this now, it's going to be done to us later.

405
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,210
事实就是如此  到时会闹得很不好看
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

406
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,340
-你是说他们会来抓我  -我们会保护你的
- You're saying they'll come for me. - We would protect you.

407
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,820
或许托尼是对的
Maybe Tony's right.

408
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,960
如果我们稍作妥协  就还有回旋余地
If, we have one hand on the wheel we can still steer.

409
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,230
但如果彻底决裂...
If we take it off...

410
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,120
你还是不是
Aren't you the same woman

411
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,330
几年前跟政府叫板的那个女人了
who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?

412
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,260
我这是...审时度势
I'm just... reading the terrain.

413
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,620
我们在公众面前犯了些大错
We have made some very public mistakes.

414
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,170
我们需要重获他们的信任
We need to win their trust back.

415
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,980
慢着
Focus up.

416
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,720
抱歉  是我听错了吗  你是在支持我吗
I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me.

417
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,210
-我想反悔了  -不不  不能收回
- Oh, I want to take it back. - No, no, no. You can't retract it.

418
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,380
谢谢啊  真是破天荒
Thank you. Unprecedented.

419
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,560
好了  这事结了
Okay, case close.

420
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,500
她在睡梦中去世了
我赢了
I win.

421
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,570
她在睡梦中去世了
.
.

422
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,020
我得走了
I have to go.

423
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,920
<b>伦敦</b>

424
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:25,620
<b>玛格丽特·佩吉·卡特</b>

425
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,460
现在
And now,

426
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,170
我想请莎伦·卡特
I would like to invite Sharon Carter,

427
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,290
上台说几句
to come up and say a few words.

428
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,410
玛格丽特·卡特为人熟知的身份是神盾局创始人
Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D.

429
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,830
但对我来说  她只是佩吉姑妈
But I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.

430
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,990
她办公室有张相片
She had a photograph in her office.

431
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,860
佩吉姑妈跟肯尼迪并肩而站
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

432
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,960
作为孩子  这让我觉得很酷
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

433
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,120
但这也是很大的压力
But, it was a lot to live up to.

434
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,230
所以我从不告诉别人我们是亲戚
Which is why I never told anyone we were related.

435
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,360
有一次我问她
I asked her once

436
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,600
在女性饱受歧视的时代
how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage

437
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,560
她是如何成为一名成功的外交官和间谍的
in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either.

438
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,530
她回答说  能妥协就妥协
She said, compromise where you can.

439
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,230
不能妥协就坚持己见
But where you can't, don't.

440
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,480
即使你身边所有人
Even if everyone is telling you

441
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,850
都把错的说成对的
that something wrong is something right.

442
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,060
即使全世界都叫你让开
Even if the whole world is telling you to move.

443
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,250
你必须如大树般稳稳站住
It is your duty, to plant yourself like a tree,

444
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,370
直视他们的眼睛说  "不...
look them in they eye and say, "No...

445
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,500
你让开"
... you move."

446
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,910
被解冻后
When I came out of the ice,

447
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,420
我以为我认识的人都死了
I thought everyone I had known was gone.

448
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,730
后来知道她还活着
When I found out that she was alive,

449
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,610
只觉得还有她在很幸运
I was just lucky to have her.

450
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,920
有你也是她的幸运
She had you back too.

451
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,360
还有谁签字了
Who else signed it.

452
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,080
托尼  罗德  幻视
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.

453
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,950
克林特呢
Clint?

454
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,310
他说自己退休了
Says he's retired.

455
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,530
-旺达呢  -待定
- Wanda? - TBD.

456
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,700
我要去维也纳签《协议》
I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords.

457
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,610
飞机上还有好多空位
There's plenty of room on the jet.

458
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,110
这虽然是最轻松的路
Just because it's the path of least resistance

459
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,330
不代表就是错的路
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.

460
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,160
团结比团结的方式更重要
Staying together is more important than how we stay together.

461
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,950
那我们要为此放弃什么
What are we giving up to do it?

462
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,870
抱歉  小娜  我不能签
I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.

463
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,200
我知道
I know.

464
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,210
那你来干吗
Then what are you doing here?

465
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,000
我不想让你一个人面对
I didn't want you to be alone.

466
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,800

Come here.

我们俩似乎都不习惯成为焦点人物
I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.

474
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,270
毕竟这不总是好事
Well, it's not always so flattering.

475

你到目前表现得还好嘛
You seem to be doing alright so far.

476
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,620
考虑到你之前在国会山的经历

477
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:48,050
想必你跟这些人待在一起不会很自在
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly comfortable in this company.

478
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,380
确实如此
Well, I'm not.

光是这一点就让我感激你能来  罗曼诺夫小姐
And that alone makes me glad you are here, Ms Romanoff.

为什么  你不赞成此举吗
Why? You don't approve of all this?

481

《协议》我支持  政治方面就不敢苟同
The Accords, yes. The politics, not really.

482

Two people, in a room, can get more done than a 100.

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,060
你向芭丝特与塞赫麦特伸出双手
You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet,

546
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,570
他们带你走进绿草原  在那里
they lead you into the green veldt where....

547
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,460
你可以永远奔跑下去
you can run forever.

548
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,850
听起来非常安宁
That sounds very peaceful.

549
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,860
我父亲也这样认为
My father thought so.

550
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,730
但是我不是我的父亲
I am not my father.

551
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,370
特查拉
T'Challa.

552
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,920
特遣队会决定谁去抓巴恩斯

553
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,560
不用麻烦了  罗曼诺夫小姐
Don't bother, Miss. Romanoff.

554
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,820
我会亲手杀了他
I'll kill him myself.

555
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,060
-喂  -你还好吗
- Yeah? - Are you alright?

556
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,210
还行  谢谢关心  我挺幸运的
Ah, yeah, thanks. I..I got lucky.

557
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,690
我知道你多在乎巴恩斯  真的
I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do.

558
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,170
待在家里  别出来
Stay home.

559
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,720
你只会让局面更糟  让我们都不好做  求你
You'll only make this worse for all of us. Please.

560
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,610
-你是说你要逮捕我吗  -不
- Are you saying you'll arrest me? - No.

561
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,720
如果你出手  会有人抓你的  现在就是这样了
Someone will, if you interfere. That's how it works now.

562
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,570
要是他都变成这样了  小娜
If he's this far gone, Nat,

563
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,260
那就该由我去抓他
I should be the one to bring him in.

564
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,110
为什么
Why?

565
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,430
因为我是最不可能因此丧命的人
Because I'm the one least likely to die trying.

566
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,390
该死
Shit.

567
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,970
她叫你别插手吗
She tell you to stay out of it?

568
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,390
-她或许有些道理  -他也会为我出手的
- Might have a point. - He'd do it for me.

569
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,140
要在1945年  有可能
1945, maybe.

570
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,630
我只是想确认我们考虑周全了
I just want to make sure we consider all our options.

571
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,530
冲你开枪的人  通常最终也会冲我开枪
The people that shoot at you, usually wind up shooting at me.

572
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,490
录像公布后收到了很多线报
Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public.

573
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,080

Everybody thinks the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.

574
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,030
大部分线索都没有价值  除了这一条
Most of it is noise, except for this.

575
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,430
我的上司现在就要简报
My boss expects a briefing pretty much now,

576
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,330
只能给你这么多情报了
so that's all the answer you're gonna get.

577
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,160
-谢谢  -你得抓紧时间
- Thank you. - And you're going to have to hurry.

578
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,090

We have orders to shoot on sight.

隔着门就闻到了
I could smell it before I opened the door.

586
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,020
熏猪肋肉和黑咖啡

00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,720
如果您需要  我可以做点儿别的
I can make you something different, if you like.

589

这就很好
This is wonderful...

590
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,820
我帮您端到...
I will just put this on your...

591

没关系  我自己来就好
It's okay, I can manage!

592
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,820
-这个怎么样  -很好的

593
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,050

那我要六个

595
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,480
给你  谢谢

我在博物馆里了解过你

604

他们设置了警戒线
They've set the perimeter.

605
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,550
我知道你有点紧张
I know you're nervous.

606
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,820
你也有理由紧张
And you have plenty of reason to be.

607
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,390
但你在撒谎
But you're lying.

608
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,890
我没去维也纳  我不做那种事了

他们没准备留你活口
And they're not planning on taking you alive.

612
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,950
很聪明  这招不错

613

他们上楼顶了  我得撤了
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.

This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.

-山姆  去西南屋顶  -另一个人是谁

马上就知道了
About to find out.

629
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,100

立刻投降
Stand down. Now.

635
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,810
恭喜你  队长  你是罪犯了
Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal.

国王殿下
Your Highness.

637
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,780
放少许辣椒粉
A pinch of paprika.

638
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,710
少许是多少
A pinch.

639
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,690
那是辣椒粉吗
Is that paprikash?

640
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,800
我想这或许能让你振奋精神
I thought it might... lift your spirits.

641
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,910
精神振奋了
Spirits lifted.

642
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,660
不好意思  我从来没有
In my defense, I..I haven't actually ever...

643
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,640
-没吃过东西  -能让我来吗
- ...eaten anything before, so... - May I.

644
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,750
请吧
Please.

-谢谢  -不客气
- Thanks. - Oh, you're welcome.

648
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,950
我的意思是
No. It's a...

649
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:00,290
这是杏仁体的一种下意识反应
involuntary response in their amygdala

650
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,580
他们控制不住害怕你
they can't help but be afraid of you.

651
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,790
你也怕我吗
Are you?

652
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,910
我的杏仁体是人造的  所以
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

653
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,820
我以前对自己有一定的看法
I used to think of myself one way.

654
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,850
但是  自从有了异能
But, after this.

655
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,640
我就变了
I am something else.

656
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,810
我还是那个我
I'm still me, I think.

657
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,420
但世人不这么看了
But... that's not what everyone else sees.

658
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,850
我不知道这是什么东西
Do you know, I don't know what this is.

659
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,580
并不清楚
Not really.

660
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,710
它不属于这个世界
I know it's not of this world.

661
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,130
它给洛基的权杖供能
But it powered Loki staff,

662
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,230
也让你拥有了异能  但是
gave you your abilities. But...

663
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,510
它的真正属性依然未知
its true nature is a mystery.

664
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,610
而它是我的一部分
And yet, it is part of me.

665
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,170
你怕它吗
Are you afraid of it?

666
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,210
我想了解它
I wish to understand it.

667
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,300
我越了解它  它对我的控制就越小
The more I do, the less it controls me.

668
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,200
或许有天  我还能控制它
One day, who knows, I may even control it.

669
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:05,630
我不知道这是什么  但肯定不是辣椒粉
I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika.

670
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,840
我去趟商店  20分钟就回来
I'm gonna go to the store, I'll be back in 20 minutes.

671
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,080
或者  我们可以订披萨
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

幻视  你是不让我离开吗
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

673
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,850
-是为了安全起见  -我能保护自己
- It is a question of safety. - I can protect myself.

674
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,420
不是你的安全
Not yours.

675

斯塔克先生想避免
Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility

until the Accords are of a... more secured foundation.

678
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,750
那你想要什么
And what do you want?

679
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,750
世人像我那样看待你
For people to see you... as I do.

686
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,690
是战士代代相传的衣钵
A mantle passed from warrior to warrior.

687
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:46,220
现在  因为你朋友杀了我父亲
And now because your friend murdered my father,

688
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,420
我也继承了国王的衣钵
I also wear the Mantle of King.

689
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,750
我倒要问你
So I ask you,

690
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
既作为战士  又是国王
as both warrior and King,

691
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,210
你觉得你还能保护你朋友多久
how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?

692
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,760
要怎么处置他
What's gonna happen?

693
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,710
按说你们也该跟他一样
Same thing that ought to happen to you.

694
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,520
进行心理评估  然后引渡

697
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,650
-那律师呢  -律师  真可笑

698
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:33,190
把他们的武器锁好
See their weapons are placed in lock up.

699
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,160
我们会给你写收据的

700
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,710
最好别让我看到
I better not look out the window

701
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,090
有人穿着我的装备在飞
and see anybody flying around in that.

702
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:48,160
我们会为您提供办公室  不会让您进牢房
You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell.

703
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,290
拜托您留在办公室里
And do me a favour, stay in it.

704
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,820
我哪也不打算去
I don't intend on going anywhere.

705
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:56,760
顺便说一句  这就是更糟的局面
For the record. This is what making things worse looks like.

706
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,910
至少他还活着
He's alive.

707
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:59,040
不不
No.

708
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,760
罗马尼亚不受《协议》保护

罗德中校在监督善后工作

710
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,550
我们处理问题期间别再惹麻烦了
Try not to break anything while we fix this.

711
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,190
问责吗  当然要问责了
Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences.

712
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,990
你当然可以引用我刚刚说的话
Obviously you can quote me on that cause I just said it.

713
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,530
还有事吗  谢谢你  先生
Anything else? Thank you, sir.

714
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,500
问责
Consequences?

715
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,160
国务卿罗斯想起诉你们俩
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.

716
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,490
我总得拿点什么嘟他的嘴
Had to give him something.

717
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,480
我拿不回盾牌了吧
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?

718
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,710
严格说  那是政府财产
Technically, it's the government's property.

719
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,450
-鹰翼也是  -太冷酷了

720
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,170
总比监狱温暖
Warmer than jail.

721
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,730
不会吧  搞什么

722
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,370
你想看点厉害的东西吗
Hey, you want to see something cool?

723
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,430
我从老爸的档案馆里找到的

726
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,750
为急需帮助的盟军提供了支持
Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.

727
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,250
有人会说这让我们国家靠近了战争
Someone would say it brought our country closer to war.

728
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,680
如果不是因为这对笔  你就不会在这儿了
See, if not for these, you wouldn't be here.

729
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:23,440
我是想  该怎么说
I'm trying to, what do you call it?

730
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,440
这是橄榄枝  是这么说的吗
That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?

731
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,730
派珀来了吗  我没见着她
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

732
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,800
我们算是...
We are... kinda...

733
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,830
-好吧  其实就是  -有喜了
- well not kinda... - Pregnant?

734
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:40,810
不  绝对没有  我们分手了
No, definitely not. We're taking a break.

735
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,180
谁都没有错
It's nobody's fault.

736
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,580
抱歉  托尼  我不知道
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

737
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,040
几年前我差点失去她
A few years ago, I almost lost her,

738
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,970
于是我毁了我所有的战甲
so I trashed all my suits.

739
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,410
然后我们不得不对付九头蛇
Then, we had to mop up Hydra.

740
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,510
之后又是奥创  这怪我
And then Ultron, my fault.

741
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:58,550
之后事情一件又一件  我一直没停下
And then, and then, and then. I never stopped.

742
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,880
因为事实就是我不想停
Cause the truth is I don't wanna stop.

743
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,050
我不想失去她
I don't want to lose her.

744
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:07,040
我想或许《协议》是个折衷的办法
I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.

745
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,700
替她说一句  我很难搞
In her defense, I'm a handful.

746
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:16,400
但我爸也不让人省心
Yet, dad was a pain in the ass, but

747
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,530
可他和我妈却很美满
he and mom always made it work.

748
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,670
我很高兴霍华德结婚了
You know, I'm glad Howard got married.

749
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:23,040
我只见过年轻单身的他
I only knew him when he was young and single.

750
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:24,740
真的吗  你们认识啊
Oh really? You two knew each other?

751
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,890
他从没提过  可能就提过一千次吧
He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times.

752
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,540
天啊  我以前真恨你
God, I hated you.

753
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,800
我不是有意让你为难
I don't mean to make things difficult.

754
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,040
我知道  因为你是个非常有礼貌的人
I know. Because you're a very polite person.

755
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:42,410
如果我觉得情况不妙  我没法无视
If I see a situation pointed south, I can't ignore it.

756
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,330
-有时我希望我能  -你才不呢
- Sometimes I wish I could. - No, you don't.

757
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,600
是啊  我不
No, I don't.

758
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:51,560
有时
Sometimes...

759
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,690
有时我真想一拳揍在你完美的牙上
Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth.

760
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:57,070
但我不希望你离开
But I don't wanna see you gone.

761
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,840
我们需要你  队长
We need you, Cap.

762
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,420
现在还没出什么不可挽回的事
So far nothing's happened that can't be undone,

763
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,900
只要你签字
if you sign.

764
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,810
我们可以把这24小时的行动合法化
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

765
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,770
巴恩斯会被转移到一家美国精神病中心
Barnes gets transferred to an American psych center

766
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,700
而不是瓦坎达监狱
instead of a Wakandan prison.

767
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,780
也不是绝对不行  但是
I'm not saying it's impossible. But

768
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,370
得有保障措施
there would have to be safeguards.

769
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,300
当然
Sure.

770
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:30,370
等公关处理好了  这些文件都可以修订
Once we put out the PR fire, these documents can be amended.

我已经提议让你和旺达复职
I filed a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated.

772
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,570
-旺达  旺达怎么了  -她很好
- Wanda? What about Wanda? - She's fine.

773
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,280
她现在被禁足在基地

774

幻视在陪着她

775
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,390
天哪  托尼  总是这样
Oh, God, Tony! Every time.

776
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,530
每次我以为你

777
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:41,790

- see things the right way... - What? It's a 100 acres

778
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,840
还带小泳池

779
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,440
放映室  这样保护人已经很好了
It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.

780
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,050
保护  你是这么觉得吗
Protection? Is that how you see this?

781
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:50,000
这是保护吗  这是拘禁  托尼
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

782
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,960
她不是美国公民
She's not a US citizen.

783
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,010
-拜托  托尼  -他们可不会给
- Oh, come on, Tony. - And they don't grant visas

784
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,300
大规模杀伤性武器批签证

785
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,280
-她还是个孩子  -饶了我吧
- She's a kid! - Give me a break!

786
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,180
只有这样做
I'm doing what has to be done

787
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,920
才能避免我们更糟的处境
... to stave off something worse.

788
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,690
你就继续自欺欺人吧
You keep telling yourself that.

789
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,930
一对儿的别分开
Hate to break up the set.

790
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,230
你好  巴恩斯先生

我是受联合国指派来评估你的
I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you.

792
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,970

797
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,370

798
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,160
我不是来指责你的

我只想问你几个问题

-这里吗  -对

808
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,550
特遣队为什么要公布这张照片
Why would the task force release this photo to begin with?

809
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,630
把消息传出去  让更多人来找
Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?

810
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,880
是啊
Right.

811
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,010
这是逼的人没法藏身的好方法
It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding.

812
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,000
引爆炸弹  被人拍到
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.

813
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,170
让七百万人寻找冬日战士
Get 7 billion people looking for the Winter soldier.

814
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,240
你是说有人为找他而陷害他
You're saying someone framed him to find him.

815
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,840
史蒂夫  我们找了他两年都一无所获
Steve, we looked for the guy for 2 years and found nothing.

816
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,840
我们没炸联合国  这可非常引人注目
We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.

817
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,910
对  但这不能保证
Yeah. But that doesn't guarantee

818
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,510
陷害他的人能找到他
that whoever framed him would get him,

819
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:04,940
只能保证我们会找到他
it guarantees that we would.

820
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:12,640
是啊
Yeah.

821
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,380
告诉我  巴基
Tell me Bucky.

822
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,030
你目睹了很多事  对吧
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

823
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,730
我不想说
I don't want to talk about it.

824
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,720
你觉得
You feel that...

825
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,730
你一旦开口  恐怖就无法停止了
if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop.

826
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,100
别担心
Don't worry.

827
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,450
<b>包裹已送达</b>

828
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,200
我们只谈一件事
We only have to talk about one.

829
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,580
这是什么
What is this?

830
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:03,850
赶紧的  各位  让我看到巴恩斯
Alright. Come on, guys. Get me eyes on Barnes.

831
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:04,900
快  快
Go. Go.

832
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,040
星期五  能查到电力中断的源头吗

东地下5层
Sub-level 5, east wing.

834
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:18,040
-怎么回事  -我们来谈谈你的家乡吧
- What the hell is this? - Why don't we discuss your home?

835
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,210
不是罗马尼亚  也不是布鲁克林
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

836
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,040
我是说  你真正的家

起来
Get up.

856
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,710
你是谁  你想干什么

857
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,320
毁灭一个帝国
To see an empire fall.

858

疏散所有民众

859
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,900
在大楼周围拉起警戒  派出武装直升机
Get me a perimeter around the building and gunships in the air.

860
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,290
你带战衣[西装]了吧
Please tell me you brought a suit.

861
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,920
当然带了 汤姆·福特的
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,

862
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,110
三件套  两扣
three-Piece, 2 button...

863
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:55,010
我现在是现役非战斗人员
I'm a active duty, non combatant.

864
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,380
跟我来
Follow me.

865
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,040
我们就位了
We're in position.

866
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,370
你至少还认得我吧
You could at least recognise me.

867
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,130
该死
Damn it.

868
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,690
他又问了我一次  你会不会来
He asked me again if you're going to be there?

869
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,940
我说我不知道
I said I wasn't sure.

870
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,760
你真该看到他那张小脸  尽量赶回来  好吗
You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay?

871
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,660
我要睡了  我爱你
I'm going to bed. I love you.

872
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:38,900
维也纳联合国爆炸案的嫌疑人詹姆斯·巴恩斯

873
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,110
今日脱逃羁押

同时失踪的还有复仇者史蒂夫·罗杰斯队长
Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers...

875
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,760
和山姆·威尔逊
and Sam Wilson.

876
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:51,820
<b>莫斯科</b>

877
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,700
队长
Hey, Cap!

878
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,570
史蒂夫
Steve.

879
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:27,290
是哪一个巴基在说话
Which Bucky am I talking to?

880
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,330
你妈妈的名字叫萨拉
Your mom's name is Sarah.

881
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:39,070
你以前会往鞋里垫报纸
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.

882
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:41,560
博物馆里可不会讲这个
Can't read that in a museum.

883
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,720
这就行了  就没事了
Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?

884
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,100
-我做了什么  -不少
- What did I do? - Enough.

885
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:48,060
天哪  我就知道会这样
Oh god, I knew this would happen.

886
01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,500
九头蛇给我灌输的东西都还在
Everything Hydra put inside me is still there.

887
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,710
他只要说几个词就能激发
All he had to do was say the god damn words.

888
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,460
-他是谁  -我不知道
- Who was he? - I don't know.

889
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,950
那场陷害你的爆炸  害死了很多人
People are dead. The bombing. The set up.

890
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:59,060
那个医生大费周章  就为跟你待上10分钟
The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you.

891
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,440
你不能只说句"我不知道"
I need you to do better than "I don't know."

892
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:07,100
他想知道西伯利亚的事
He wanted to know about Siberia.

893
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:11,650
我被关押的地方
Where I was kept.

894
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,670
他想知道具体位置
He wanted to know exactly where.

895
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:17,110
他为什么要知道这个
Why would he need to know that?

896
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,190
因为冬日战士不止我一个
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.

897
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,640
很好
Good work.

898
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,630
带我出去
Get me out of here.

899
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,120
-他们是谁  -精英敢死队
- Who were they? - Their most elite death squad.

900
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,660
九头蛇史上杀人数最多的
More kills than anyone in Hydra history.

901
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,840
那还是在注射血清之前
And that was before the serum.

902
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,240
他们都变得跟你一样吗
They all turned out like you?

903
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,250
更糟
Worse.

904
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,950
那个医生能控制他们吗
The doctor, can he control them?

905
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,740
八九不离十
Enough.

906
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,830
他说他想毁灭一个帝国
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

907
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:40,400
有那些人的帮助  他就做得到
With these guys he could do it.

908
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:43,250
他们会30种语言  来去不着痕迹
They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight,

909
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,700
渗透  暗杀  颠覆
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize,

910
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,880
他们能在一夜之间毁灭一个国家
they can take a whole country down in one night.

911
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,730
打得你措手不及
You'd never see them coming.

912
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,020
搁在一周前这事会简单得多
This would've been a lot easier a week ago.

913
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,520
如果我们告诉托尼
If we call Tony.

914
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,120
-他不会相信的  -即便他信
- No, he won't believe us. - Even if he did...

915
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,410
谁知道《协议》会不会允许他帮忙
Who knows if the Accords would let him help.

916
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,060
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own.

917
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,330
未必
Maybe not.

918
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:07,270
我认识一个人
I know a guy.

919
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:11,990
我猜你不知道他们在哪吧
I don't suppose you have any idea where they are.

920
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:14,320
会知道的  边防9队守着国界
We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered.

921
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,330
侦察机也在全天候搜查
Recons flying 24/7.

922
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,820
他们会有发现  我们就去处理
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

923
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,000
你不明白  斯塔克  这事不归你处理
You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle.

924
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,360
你显然无法客观对待此事
It's clear you can't be objective.

925
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,020
我要让特种部队负责
I'm putting special ops on this.

926
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,500
如果交上了火怎么办
And what happens when the shooting starts?

927
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:26,660
你要杀了史蒂夫·罗杰斯吗
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

928
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,290
如果他不乖乖就范
If we're provoked.

929
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,320
要不是罗杰斯  我们在罗马尼亚
Barnes would've been eliminate in Romania

930
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,880
就能消灭巴恩斯了
if it wasn't for Rogers.

931
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,520
有些本不该死的人因此丧命
There are dead people who would be alive now.

932
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:38,140
你倒想想我说没说错
Feel free to check my math.

933
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:38,920
无意冒犯
All due respect,

934
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,520
这事凭武力是解决不了的  罗斯
you're not gonna solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.

935
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,600
你得让我们去抓他
You got to let us bring him in.

936
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,750
这次和上次又会有什么不同
How would that end any differently than last time?

937
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,370
这次我不会穿便装行动
Because this time I won't be wearing Loafers and a silk shirt.

938
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,970
72小时  我保证
72 hours, guarantee.

939
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:52,540
36小时
36 hours.

940
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,830
巴恩斯
Barnes.

941
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:58,470
罗杰斯
Rogers.

942
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,310
威尔逊
Wilson.

943
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,530
多谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

944
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,160
我左手臂麻了  这是正常现象吗
My left arm is numb, is that normal?

945
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,420
你还好吗
You alright?

946
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:14,040
没事
Always.

947
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:19,610
36小时  天啊
36 hours, jeez.

948
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:23,060
-我们人手严重不足  -是啊
- We're seriously understaffed. - Oh, yeah.

949
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:26,650
如果绿巨人在就好了  有他的线索吗
It would be great if we had a hulk, right about now. Any shot?

950
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,940
你真觉得他会站我们这边吗
You really think he'd be on our side?

951
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,430
不会
No.

952
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,970
-我有个主意  -我也是
- I have an idea. - Me too.

953
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,710
-你的在哪  -楼下
- Where's yours? - Downstairs.

954
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,580
你的呢
Where's yours?

955
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:46,790
<b>皇后区</b>

957
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:09,280
-今天学校顺利吗  -还不错
- How was school today? - It was okay.

我们该见见了  你收到我邮件了吧

970
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,540
这事现在就算成了
So now, we're in business.

971
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,800
你都没告诉过我  这是怎么回事
You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that?

972
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,120
-你现在还瞒我事了吗  -我只是...
- You're keeping secrets from me? - Why, I just...

973
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,690
我知道你很喜欢惊喜
I just know how much you love surprises,

974
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:50,600
所以我想等回头再告诉你
so I thought I would let you know... wh...

975
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,950
话说回来  我申请了什么
Anyway, what did I apply for?

976
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:52,770
这就是我来要解决的事
That's what I'm here to hash out.

977
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,630
好  解决  好吧
Okay, hash, hash out, okay.

978
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:57,440
她居然都当婶婶了  简直难以置信
It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.

979
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,300
对啊  什么样的婶婶都有嘛
Yeah well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know.

980
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,450
这个核桃红枣面包太好吃了
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

981
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,010
-能先停停吗  -怎么了
- Let me just stop you there. - Yeah?

982
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:08,130
这个基金  是跟钱有关的吗
Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?

983
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:08,630
没错
Yeah.

984
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,360
-没错  -资金非常充足
- Yeah. - It's pretty well funded.

985
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:12,060
也不看看我是谁
Look who you're talking to.

986
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,650
-我能跟他谈五分钟吗  -请便
- Can I have 5 minutes with him? - Sure.

987
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:23,690
作为核桃红枣面包  这味道还不错了
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.

988
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,910
这是什么  复古科技吗
What do we have here, retro tech, huh?

989
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:30,990
-二手店  救世军  -捡的垃圾

随便了  那个
Anyway, look.

992
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:36,560
我绝对没申请过你的基金
I definitely did not apply for your grant.

993
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:38,050
-我先说  -好吧
- Me first. - Okay.

994
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:40,530
有个反问的问题要问你
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

995
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:43,910
这是你吧
That's you, right?

996
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,390
不是
Um, no.

997
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,860
-你什么意思  -就是你
- What do you. What do you... - Yeah.

998
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,420
看你的动作
Look at you go.

999
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:52,840
接得漂亮  时速40英里  三千磅的车
Wow, nice catch! 3000 pounds. 40 miles an hour.

1000
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:55,820
这可不容易  你很厉害啊
It's not easy. You got mad skills.

1001
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,820
这是油管上的吧  对吗
That's all-That's all on Youtube though, right?

1002
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,420
你是在那儿找到的吧
I mean that's where you found it.

1003
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,090
这些可都是假的  是电脑特效
Cause' you know that's all fake. It's all done on a computer?

1004
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,730
就像那个视频一样  什么来着
It's like that video, what is it?

1005
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:07,420
对对  就像凤凰城上空的飞碟吗
Yeah yeah yeah... you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?

1006
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,420
没错
Exactly!

1007
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,540
这是什么
What have we here?

1008
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,820
这是...
That's a...

1009
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,090

1013
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,440
就穿这连体睡衣  还叫侠
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1014
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,660
这不是连体睡衣
It's not a onesie.

1015
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:34,120
难以置信
I don't believe this.

1016
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,690
我今天其实还真挺顺利的呢  斯塔克先生
I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark.

1017
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:37,790
没误地铁
Didn't miss my trains.

1018
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:40,560
毫不费力地捡到一台质量很好的DVD机
This perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and...

1019
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:43,330
代数考试也轻松搞定
Algebra test. Nailed it!

1020
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,830
还有谁知道  有人知道吗
Who else knows? Anybody?

1021
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,660
没人了
Nobody.

1022
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,830
连你那位异常迷人的婶婶也不知道吗
Not even your... unusually attractive Aunt?

1023
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:51,520
不
No.

1024
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,180
不知道
No, no. No, no.

1025
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,920
如果她知道  她会抓狂的
If she knew, she would freak out.

1026
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,740
她抓狂  我就慌乱
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1027
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,190
知道我觉得什么很厉害吗  这个网
You know what I think is really cool? This webbing.

1028

抗拉强度简直爆表
Tensile strength is off the charts.

1029
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,410
-是谁制造的  -我
- Who manufactured them? - I did.

1030
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,010
爬墙
Climbing the walls.

1031
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,070
怎么做到的  粘性手套吗
How are you doing that? Adhesive gloves?

1032
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,790
说来话长  我...
It's a long story. I was uh...

1033
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:14,100
老天爷  戴这东西还能看见吗
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1034
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,290
-是的  我能看见  -我瞎了
- Yes. Yes, I can! I can. - I'm blind!

1035
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,910
能看见的  好吗  就是...
I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that...

1036
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,470
那件事发生之后
when...whatever happened happened,

1037
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,790
我的感官变得超级敏感
it's like my senses have been dialed to 11.

1038
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:28,020
接收的信息实在太多
There's... There's way too much input, so...

1039
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,860
所以戴那个能帮我集中注意
they... they just kinda help me focus.

1040
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:31,980
你继续升级装备
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1041
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,120
从头到脚  系统化地升级
Systemic, top to bottom.

1042
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,090
全部翻新  我就是为此而来
100-point restoration. That's why I'm here.

1043
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:40,220
你为什么要做这个
Why are you doing this?

1044
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,470
我必须要问问  你的动力是什么
I got to know. What's your M.O.

1045
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,600
是什么激励你早上起床
What gets you out of that twin bed in the morning?

1046
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,450
因为
Because...

1047
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:52,200
因为我这辈子一直都是平凡的自己
because I've been me my whole life,

1048
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,620
六个月前我得到了这些能力
and I've had these powers for 6 months.

1049
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,940
我读书  搭建电脑
I read books, I build computers...

1050
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,750
还有  我很想去打橄榄球
And-And yeah. I would love to play football.

1051
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:03,920
但我之前打不了  所以现在又不能去
But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.

1052
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,670
-是啊  因为你变了  -没错
- Sure. 'Cause you're different. - Exactly.

1053
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,800
但我不能说出去  所以我没说
But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not.

1054
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,500
如果你有了这份能力
Look, when you can do the things that I can,

1055
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:17,030
却不作为
but you don't...

1056
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,440
之后发生的坏事
and then the bad things happen,

1057
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:23,730
就是你的责任
they happen because of you.

1058
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:31,510
你想帮助小人物  你想尽一份力
So you wanna look out for the little guy. You wanna do your part.

1059
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:33,200
让这世界更美好什么的  是吗
Make the world a better place all that, right?

1060
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,910
是啊  就是帮助小人物
Yeah. Yeah just looking out... for the little guy.

1061
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,380
就是这样
That's-That's what it is.

1062
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:47,950
我要坐这儿  腿移开
I'm going to sit here, so you move the leg.

1063
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,740
-有护照吗  -没有
- You got a passport? - Uh, no.

1064
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,970
我连驾照都没有
I don't.. don't even have a driving license.

1065
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,190
去过德国吗
You ever been to Germany?

1066
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:02,460
-没有  -你会喜欢那里的
- No. - Oh, you'll love it.

1067
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,570
-我不能去德国  -为什么
- I can't go to Germany! - Why?

1068
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,850
我还有作业呢
I got... homework.

1069
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:10,470
好吧  我会当你没说那话
Alright, I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1070
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:13,160
不  我认真的  我不能就辍学
No. I'm-I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!

1071
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,200
可能会有点危险
Might be a little dangerous.

1072
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,970
最好跟漂亮婶婶说一声我要带你出去
Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.

1073
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,550
别告诉梅婶婶
Don't tell Aunt May.

1074
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,280
好吧  蜘蛛侠

- What is it? - Stay here, please.

1077
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,350
-看来我该敲门的  -天呐
- Guess I should have knocked. - Oh my god.

1078
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:58,060
-你来做什么  -放孩子的鸽子
- What are you doing here? - Disappointing my kids.

1079
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,000
我本该带他们去滑水的
I'm suppose to go water skiing.

1080
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:06,300
但是队长需要我们帮忙  走吧

1084
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:18,110
我才退休了5分钟  世界就乱套了
I retired for, what, like 5 minutes? And it all goes to shit.

1085
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,640
请考虑一下你行为的后果
Please consider the consequences of your actions.

1086
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:21,970

1094
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,320
就知道我该先活动下筋骨的
I know I should have stretched.

1095
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:10,730
-克林特  你打不过我  -我知道
- Clint, you can't overpower me. - I know I can't

1096
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:13,020
但她能
But, she can.

1097
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,060
幻视  够了  放了他
Vision. That's enough, let him go.

1098
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:21,310
-我要走了  -我不能让你走
- I'm leaving. - I can't let you.

1099
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,850
对不起
I'm sorry.

1100
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:32,770
如果你这么做
If you do this,

1101
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:36,210
世人会永远害怕你
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1102
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:41,150
他们的恐惧我控制不了  但我的可以
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1103
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:59,100
走吧  还有一站呢
Come on. We got one more stop.

1104
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,380
早晚会找到的
It's just a matter of time.

1105
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,450
我们的卫星在进行面部识别
Our satellites are running facial,

1106
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:06,390
生物识别和行为模式扫描
biometric and behavioral pattern scans.

1107
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:13,080
闪开  别逼我动手
Move, or you will be moved.

1108
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,690
虽然那会很有看头
As entertaining as that would be.

1109
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,800
你真觉得你能找到他吗
You really think you can find him?

1110
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,490
我的资源很可观
My resources are considerable.

1111
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,870
是啊  世界花了70年时间才找到巴恩斯
Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes...

1112
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:26,470
你大概花一半时间就能做到了
So, you could probably do that in about half the time.

1113
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:29,000
你知道他们在哪
You know where they are.

1114
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:31,040
我认识一个知道的人
I know someone who does.

1115
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:36,850
你恐怕不太明白什么叫逃跑车吧
I'm not sure you understand the concept of a get-away car.

1116
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:38,390
这车低调
It's low profile.

1117
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:41,190
很好  这些东西可是很招眼
Good, 'cause this stuff tends to draw a crowd.

1118
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:45,820
-你能把座椅往前点吗  -不能
- Can you move your seat up? - No.

1119
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:47,580
我又欠你个人情
I owe you again.

1120
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,180
我记着呢
Keeping a list.

1121
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,480
他之前可企图杀我呢
You know, he kind of tried to kill me.

1122
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:57,880
抱歉  那个我也会记着的
Sorry, I'll put it on the list, too.

1123
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:02,770
他们会来找你的
They're gonna come looking for you.

1124
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:04,880
我知道
I know.

1125
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:08,790
谢谢你  莎伦
Thank you, Sharon.

1126
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,520
-这真是  -早该了
- That was... - Late.

1127
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:27,850
可不是
Damn right.

1128
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,860
-我该走了  -好
- I should go. - Okay.

1129
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,760
队长
Cap.

1130
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,140
你知道我不是别无选择也不会找你
You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.

1131
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:03,810
你是帮我忙呢
Hey man, you're doing me a favour.

1132
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:06,340
再说  我还要还债
Besides... I owed a debt.

1133
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:10,060
-多谢支持我  -我该行动起来了
- Thanks for having my back. - It was time to get off my ass.

1134
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,890
另一个新人呢
How about our other recruit.

1135
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:13,280
他迫不及待呢
He's raring to go.

1136
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,230
我给了他点咖啡
Had to put a little coffee in him... but

1137
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,170
他应该没问题
he should be good.

1138
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,130
这是哪个时区
What timezone is this?

1139
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,000
去吧  去吧
Come on. Come on.

1140
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:30,080
-美国队长  -朗先生
- Captain America. - Mr. Lang.

1141
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,210
真是荣幸  我握得太久了
It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long.

1142
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,090
这太赞了  美国队长啊
This is awesome. Captain America.

1143
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,740
你我也认识  你好棒
I know you too, you're great.

1144
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:43,230
天呐
Jeez.

1145
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,070
我想说
Look, I wanted to say.

1146
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:47,470
我知道你认识很多厉害人物
I know you know a lot of super people, so...

1147
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:49,890
多谢想到我
Thanks for thinking of me.

1148
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,530
-伙计  -好啊  小豆子
- Hey, man. - What's up tic-tac.

1149
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:54,800
见到你很高兴  那个  上次的事
Good to see you. Look. Look, what happened last time when I...

1150
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,460
是场很棒的面试  但绝不会再有下次了
It was a great audition, but it'll... it'll never happen again.

1151
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,910
他们告诉你我们要对付什么了吗
They tell you what we're up against?

1152
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,880
好像是几个疯子刺客
Something about some... psycho assassins.

1153
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:06,290
这次我们的行动不合法
We're outside the law on this one.

1154
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:08,560
如果你跟我们来  就是通缉犯了
So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.

1155
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,470
早习惯了
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1156
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:13,330
-我们该走了  -有架直升机等着我们呢
- We should get moving. - We got a chopper lined up.

1157
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,240
他们在疏散机场
They're evacuating the airport.

1158
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,270
-斯塔克  -斯塔克
- Stark. - Stark?

1159
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:24,930
换装
Suit up.

1160
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,820
在机场总能碰到熟人  真是怪啊
It's so weird how you run into people at the airport.

1161
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,760
-你说是不是  -非常怪
- Don't you think that's weird? - Definitely weird.

1162
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,030
听我说  托尼
Hear me out, Tony.

1163
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:54,420
那个精神病医生  他才是幕后黑手
That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.

1164
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,130
-队长  -殿下
- Captain. - Your Highness.

1165
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,610
总之
Anyway.

1166
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,000
罗斯给了我36小时带你回去
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.

1167
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,700
已经过了24小时了
That was 24 hours ago.

1168
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,320
-帮兄弟一把啊  -你抓错人了
- Can you help a brother out? - You're after the wrong guy.

1169
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,270
你的判断力有问题
Your judgment is askew.

1170
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:12,940
你的老战友昨天杀了很多无辜者
Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.

1171
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,520
还有5个跟他一样的超级战士
And there are 5 more super soldiers just like him.

1172
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,700
我不能让那个医生先找到他们  托尼
I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.

1173
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:19,740
史蒂夫
Steve.

1174
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,270
你知道接下来会怎么样
You know, what's about to happen.

1175
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:25,860
你这次也要打出一条血路吗
Do you really want to punch your way out of this one?

1176
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,860
好吧  我没耐心了
All right, I've run out of patience.

1177
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,120
内衣宝宝
Underoos!

1178
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:39,400
干得好  孩子
Nice job, kid.

1179
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:42,010
谢谢  落地不太理想
Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better.

1180
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:43,180
新服装...不太适应
It's... just the new suit...

1181
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,450
等等  这不是事儿  斯塔克先生
Wait, it's nothing, Mr. Stark.

1182
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:45,580
服装很完美  谢谢您
It's-It's perfect, thank you.

1183
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,370
嗯  我们不用开始闲扯的
Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.

1184
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:49,410
好吧  队长
Okay. Cap... Captain.

1185
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,370
我是蜘蛛侠  你的大粉丝
Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.

1186
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:53,230
行了  回头再说
Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just...

1187
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,730
-大家好  -干得好
- Hey, everyone. - ...good job.

1188
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:57,990
-你没闲着啊  -你好傻啊
- You've been busy. - And you've been a complete idiot.

1189
01:29:58,330 --> 01:29:59,240
把克林特扯进来
Dragging in Clint.

1190
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,500
把旺达从她不想离开的地方救出去
Rescuing Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave.

1191
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:04,100
一个安全的地方  我在努力...
A safe place. I'm trying to keep....

1192
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,430
我在努力阻止你分裂复仇者联盟
I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.

1193
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,750
你签字时就已经分裂我们了
You did that when you signed.

1194
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:13,650
好吧  行了
Alright, we're done.

1195
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:16,550
交出巴恩斯  跟我们走
You're gonna turn Barnes over and you're gonna come with us,

1196
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:18,690
马上照做  否则
now, because it's us

1197
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:19,840
一支联合特别行动司令部的分队
or a squad of J-SOC guys...

1198
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,440
会来抓你们  他们下手不会留情的
with no compunction about being impolite.

1199
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:25,920
拜托了
Come on.

1200
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,160
我们找到了
We found it.

1201
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:32,540
昆式战斗机在北跑道的5号机库
The quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.

1202
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,420
行动  朗
Alright, Lang.

1203
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:39,760
各位  有什么东西
Hey, guys. Something...

1204
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:42,120
那是什么情况
What-What the hell was that?

1205
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,050
这是你的吧  美国队长
I believe this is yours, Captain America.

1206
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:46,590
这可好  好了  停车场有俩
Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck.

1207
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,590
其中一个是马克西莫夫  我去抓她
One of them is Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her.

1208
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:49,890
罗德  你应付队长啊
Rhodey, you want to take Cap?

1209
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:52,130
候机大厅有俩  威尔逊和巴恩斯
Got two in the terminal. Wilson and Barnes.

1210
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:53,400
巴恩斯是我的
Barnes is mine!

1211
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,940
斯塔克先生  我该做什么
Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?

1212
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,920
不是说好了吗  别靠太近  用网缠住他们
What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web them up.

1213
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,130
好的  收到
Okay, copy that!

1214
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,280
让开  队长
Move, Captain.

1215
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:07,830
我不会说第二遍
I won't ask a second time.

1216
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:11,790
听着  我真的不想伤害你
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.

1217
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,580
不必担心
I wouldn't stress about it.

1218
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,130
-那是什么鬼  -这年头谁都有点花招
- What the hell was that? - Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1219
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,970
你有金属臂  太牛逼了  哥们
You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!

1220
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:42,440
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent!

1221
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,010
对不住了  队长  虽然不致命
Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you

1222
01:31:58,010 --> 01:31:59,720
但还是会挺疼的
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1223
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:06,860
旺达  我觉得你伤了幻视的心
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.

1224
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,250
你把我关在房间里
You locked me in my room.

1225
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,900
好吧  首先  这说法太夸张了
Okay. First, that's an exaggeration.

1226
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,060
其次  我是为了保护你
Second, I did it to protect you.

1227
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:13,760
-克林特  -伙计
- Hey, Clint. - Hey, man.

1228
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,220
看来退休生活不适合你  高尔夫打烦了吗
Clearly retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?

1229
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,830
我玩18杆  杆杆进洞
Well, I played 18, shot 18.

1230
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:22,480
就是射不偏
Just can't seem to miss.

1231
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:27,250
-凡事总有第一次啊  -让你转头了
- First time for everything. - Made you look.

1232
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:39,570
检测到多处挫伤
Multiple contusions detected.

1233
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,400
嗯  我也检测到了
Yeah, I detected that too.

1234
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,840
天啊
Oh, god.

1235
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:53,310
伙计  这是你丢的吧
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!

1236
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:06,270
这翅膀是碳化纤维的
Those wings carbon fiber?

1237
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:07,580
这玩意是你射出来的
Is this stuff coming out of you?

1238
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,760
如果是  这刚柔度就不难理解了
That would explain the rigidity flexibility ratio.

1239
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,280
我得说  真是牛逼
which, gotta say, that's awesome man.

1240
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,860
不知道你参没参加过战斗
I don't know if you've been a fight before

1241
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:14,540
但我们一般没这么多废话
but there's usually not this much talking.

1242
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:16,090
好吧  不好意思  我的错
Alright, sorry, my bad.

1243
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,390
两位  我也想继续和你们打
Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up

1244
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,850
但我今天只有一项任务
but I've only got one job here today

1245
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:25,260
我得给斯塔克先生留个好印象
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,

1246
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:27,900
真抱歉了  什么
so, I'm really sorry. What?

1247
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:32,610
你就不能早点那么做吗
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1248
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,890
讨厌
I hate you.

1249
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:42,320
这可好
Great?

1250
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,530
队长  接着
Cap, heads up!

1251
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:47,150
朝这玩意扔
Throw it at this.

1252
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:48,300
扔
Now!

1253
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,230
不是吧
Oh, come on!

1254
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,120
天呐  我以为是辆水车
Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck.

1255
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:00,910
抱歉
Sorry.

1256
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:04,960
好吧  我现在被惹毛了
Alright. Now, I'm pissed.

1257
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,960
这是计划的一部分吗
Is this part of the plan?

1258
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,720
我本来计划对他们客气些的  想加大火力吗
Well, my plan was go easy on them. You want to switch it up?

1259
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:13,860
那是我们的飞机
There's our ride.

1260
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:16,530
跟上
Come on!

1261
01:34:25,650 --> 01:34:27,090
罗杰斯队长
Captain Rogers.

1262
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,880
我知道你相信自己是对的
I know you believe what you're doing is right.

1263
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:35,500
但为了大局  你必须马上投降
But, for the collective good, you must surrender now.

1264
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:54,350
怎么办  队长
What do we do, Cap?

1265
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,790
我们战斗
We fight.

1266
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:00,190
这下可好
This is gonna end well.

1267
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,590
他们没打算停下来
They're not stopping.

1268
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:09,670
我们也不会停
Neither are we.

1269
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:43,720
-我们还是朋友吧  -要看你下手多狠了
- We're still friends, right? - Depends on how hard you hit me.

1270
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,990
你放水了
You were pulling your punches.

1271
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:01,470
-我没杀你父亲  -那你跑什么
- I didn't kill your father. - Then why did you run?

1272
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:21,590
那玩意根本不符合物理定律啊
That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.

1273
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:23,780
孩子  这里有很多你不懂的事
Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.

1274
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,430
斯塔克先生说过你会这么说
Mr. Stark said you'd say that.

1275
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,310
他还说要攻击你的腿
He also said to go for your legs.

1276
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:50,490
克林特  能帮我甩掉他吗
Clint, can you get him off me?

1277
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:53,540
-抓紧了吗  -抓紧了
- Buckled in? - Yeah. No, I'm good.

1278
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,800
抓紧了  弓箭男  来吧
I'm good, arrow-guy. Let's go. Let's go!

1279
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:18,810
斯塔克还跟你说别的了吗
Stark tell you anything else?

1280
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:21,270
你错了  你觉得你没错
That you're wrong. You think you're right.

1281
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,610
所以你很危险
That makes you dangerous.

1282
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:30,190
他说得也没错
Guess he had a point.

1283
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,510
你挺有勇气  你从哪来的
You got heart, kid. Where're you from?

1284
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:39,320
皇后区
Queens.

1285
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,690
我布鲁克林的
Brooklyn.

1286
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:50,260
-星期五  -部分武器系统离线
- F.R.I.D.A.Y.? - We have some weapon systems offline.

1287
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:51,170
什么
Hey, what?

1288
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:53,960
估计得返厂维修了
Oh, you.. you're gonna have to take this into the shop.

1289
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:57,290
-谁在说话  -你的良心
- Who's speaking? - It's your conscience.

1290
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:59,270
我们最近都没怎么交流
We don't talk a lot these days.

1291
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:01,820
-星期五 -启动灭火系统
- F.R.I.D.A.Y.? - Deploying fire suppression system.

1292
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,060
天啊
Oh, boy.

1293
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:18,470
我们得走了  那家伙现在都该到西伯利亚了
We got to go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1294
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:20,100
得把会飞的引开
We gotta draw out the fliers.

1295
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:21,910
我应付幻视  你去飞机那儿
I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.

1296
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:24,800
不  你们去上飞机  你俩都去
No, you get to the jet! Both of you!

1297
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,440
我们其他人走不了了
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.

1298
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,270
虽然我不想承认  如果我们想打赢
As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one,

1299
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:32,870
就得有些人输
some of us might have to lose it.

1300
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:35,090
这不是真正重要的战斗  史蒂夫
This isn't the real fight, Steve.

1301
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,030
好吧  山姆  什么计划
Alright, Sam, what's the plan?

1302
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:39,520
我们得搞个大动静来转移注意力
We need a diversion, something big.

1303
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:44,440
我有个大家伙  但坚持不了多久
I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long.

1304
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,650
等我信号  拼命跑
On my signal, run like hell.

1305
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:49,490
如果我把自己扯成了两半  也别回来救我
And if I tear myself in half, don't come back for me.

1306
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:51,860
-他要把自己扯成两半了  -你没问题吗  斯科特
- He's gonna tear himself in half? - You sure about this, Scott?

1307
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:54,380
我经常这样做  其实就那么一次
I do it all the time. I mean once...

1308
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:56,910
在实验室里  然后我晕过去了
...in a lab. Then I passed out.

1309
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,160
我最拽  我最拽  我最拽
I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

1310
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:00,970
我最拽
I'm the boss.

1311
01:39:15,470 --> 01:39:17,250
我勒个去
Holy shit!

1312
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:23,510
那个小不点变大了  他变大了
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.

1313
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,500
这大概就是信号了
I guess that's the signal.

1314
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,180
厉害  小豆子
Way to go, tic-tac!

1315
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,620
把我的罗德还我
Give me back my Rhodey.

1316
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:35,900
我去接他
I got him!

1317
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:01,010
好了  我们这边还有谁隐藏了什么惊人
Okay. Anybody on our side hiding any shocking,

1318
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:03,340
了不起的能力想展现出来吗
and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose,

1319
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,140
我愿意接受建议
I'm open to suggestions.

1320
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:16,040
你想抓他们  先过我这关
You want to get to them? You got to go through me.

1321
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:43,790
我们还不认识彼此
We haven't met yet.

1322
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,780
-我是克林特  -我不在乎
- I'm Clint. - I don't care.

1323
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:17,500
下去
Get off.

1324
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:34,030
有什么东西飞进我身体里了
Something just flew in me!

1325
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:59,370
你不会停下的  是吗
You're not gonna stop?

1326
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,930
你知道我不能
You know I can't.

1327
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:03,030
我肯定要后悔的
I'm gonna regret this.

1328
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,460
快走
Go.

1329
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:15,990
各位  你们看过那部超老的电影吗
Hey, guys. You ever see that really old movie?

1330
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,270
《帝国反击战》
Empire Strikes Back?

1331
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:18,900
老天  托尼  这家伙多大
Jesus Tony, how old is this guy?

1332
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,120
我不知道  我又没给他碳测年
I don't know, I didn't carbon date him.

1333
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,640
反正挺小的
He's on the young side.

1334
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:24,720
你知道那一段吗
You know that part?

1335
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,580
就是他们在那个雪星球上  那个会走的机器
When they're on the snow planet? With the walking thingies?

1336
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,690
这孩子的点子可能行得通
Maybe the kid's on to something.

1337
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:34,200
往上飞  托尼  往上飞
High now, Tony. Go high.

1338
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:43,280
好诶
Yes!

1339
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,270
太牛逼了
That was awesome!

1340
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:02,900
有人有橙片吗
Does anyone have any orange slices?

1341
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,760
孩子  没事吧
Hey, kid, you alright?

1342
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:12,540
-放开我  -友军
- Get off me! - Same side.

1343
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:13,440
猜猜我是谁
Guess who?

1344
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:15,050
是我
It's me.

1345
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:16,350
-伙计  -嗯
- Hey, man. - Yeah.

1346
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:17,650
-吓死人了  -是啊
- That was scary. - Yeah.

1347
01:43:17,650 --> 01:43:19,790
-你结束了  知道吗  -什么
- You're done. Alright? - What?

1348
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:21,230
-你干得很好  待这儿吧  -我没事的
- You did a good job. Stay down.  - I'm good. I'm fine.

1349
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:22,510
-待这儿吧  -不  我得把他抓回来
- Stay down. - No, it's good I gotta get him back!

1350
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:24,120
回家去  否则我打给梅婶婶了
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!

1351
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,070
-伙计  -你收工了
- Dude. - You're done!

1352
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:26,460
等等
Wait.

1353
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,500
斯塔克先生  等等  我还能打  我...
Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not...

1354
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:33,830
好吧  我不行了
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.

1355
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,010
我说会帮你找到他  不是抓到他
I said that I'd help you find him, not catch him.

1356
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,640
这是有区别的
There's a difference.

1357
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,310
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1358
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,210
我也是
Me too.

Otherwise, I got to arrest myself.

If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.

- It's just the first pass. - Yeah.

1631
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:25,410
给我反馈  想到什么都行
Give me some feedback. Anything you think of.

1632
02:13:25,410 --> 02:13:28,170
减震  横向移动
Shock absorption. Lateral movement.

1633
02:13:29,030 --> 02:13:29,940
杯架
Cup holder?

1634
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:32,150
或许该考虑在下面按空调
You may wanna think about some AC down in...

1635
02:13:35,630 --> 02:13:36,580
好了  我拉你
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.

1636
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:38,360
不不  别帮我  别帮我
No, no, don't. Don't help. Don't help me.

1637
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:58,710
138次  138次战斗任务
138. 138 combat missions.

1638
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:01,070
我飞过138次战斗任务  托尼
That's how many I've flown, Tony.

1639
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:04,310
每次都可能有去无回  但我还是去了
Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew them.

1640
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:08,270
因为那是必须打的仗
Cause the fight needed to be fought.

1641
02:14:08,690 --> 02:14:10,500
《协议》的事也是一样
It's the same with these Accords.

1642
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:13,840
我签字是因为那是正确的做法
I signed because it was the right thing to do.

1643
02:14:16,130 --> 02:14:18,310
这事的确太糟心了
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...

1644
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,930
真是不走运
This is a bad beat.

1645
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:25,230
但这没改变我的想法
But it hasn't change my mind.

1646
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,550
我觉得没有
I don't think?

1647
02:14:38,630 --> 02:14:40,350
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You okay? - Oh, yeah.

1648
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:45,880
你是托尼·"屎塔克"吗
Are you Tony "Stank"?

1649
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:50,580
是的  他就是托尼·"屎塔克"  你来对地方了
Yes, this is-this is Tony "Stank"! You're in the right place.

1650
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:52,050
多谢了
Thank you for that!

1651
02:14:52,610 --> 02:14:54,530
-这梗我要用一辈子  -天呐
- Never dropping that, by the way. - Oh, my god.

1652
02:14:54,530 --> 02:14:58,170
一人桌  "屎塔克"先生  坐在厕所边吧
Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.

1653
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:05,400
托尼
Tony.

1654
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,390
我很高兴你回到了基地
I'm glad you're back at the compound.

1655
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:11,720
我不希望你一个人在豪宅里晃
I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself.

1656
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:13,230
我们都需要家人
We all need family.

1657
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:18,180
复仇者联盟属于你  或许多于属于我
The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine.

1658
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:21,670
我从18岁开始就是一个人
I've been on my own since I was 18.

1659
02:15:22,710 --> 02:15:26,880
我从未真正融入哪里  哪怕是在军队
I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army.

1660
02:15:28,870 --> 02:15:33,320
我想我信任  人  个体
My faith's in... people, I guess. Individuals.

1661
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:37,010
很高兴  大部分时候
And, I'm happy to say that for the most part,

1662
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,910
他们没让我失望
they haven't let me down.

1663
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:43,510
所以我也不能辜负他们
Which is why I can't let them down either.

1664
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:50,770
锁可以换  但或许不该换
Locks can be replaced, but, maybe they shouldn't.

1665
02:15:53,050 --> 02:15:54,440
我知道我伤了你  托尼
I know I hurt you, Tony.

1666
02:15:55,340 --> 02:15:56,520
我大概是觉得
I guessed I thought

1667
02:15:56,590 --> 02:16:00,180
不告诉你你父母的事  是照顾你的感情
by not telling you about your parents, I was sparing you. But...

1668
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:03,370
但我现在明白  我只是在照顾自己
I can see now that I was really sparing myself.

1669
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:05,050
对不起
And I'm sorry.

1670
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:08,080
希望你有天能理解
Hopefully one day you can understand.

1671
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:11,020
我也希望我们能在《协议》的事上达成一致
I wish we agree on the Accords,

1672
02:16:11,020 --> 02:16:11,890
真的
I really do.

1673
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:14,260
我知道你只是在做你相信的事
I know you're doing what you believe in.

1674
02:16:14,260 --> 02:16:17,440
而我们也都只能做到这点  我们也该这么做
And that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should.

1675
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:19,540
国务卿罗斯的优先来电
Priority call from Secretary Ross.

1676
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:21,750
孤岛监狱遭人劫狱
There's been a breach at the Raft Prison.

1677
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:24,330
嗯  接过来
Yeah, put him through.

1678
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,270
-托尼  我们有麻烦了  -请待机
- Tony, we have a problem. - Ah, please hold.

1679
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:30,070
不  别
No. Don't...

1680
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:33,630
所以  不管怎样
So, no matter what.

1681
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:36,030
我保证
I promise you,

1682
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:37,390
如果你需要我们
if you need us,

1683
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:39,790
如果你需要我
if you need me,

1684
02:16:45,410 --> 02:16:46,330
我会去的
I'll be there.

1685
02:18:46,190 --> 02:18:47,450
你确定吗
You sure about this?

1686
02:18:49,050 --> 02:18:50,890
我不能信任自己的大脑
I can't trust my own mind.

1687
02:18:53,710 --> 02:18:56,330
直到他们想到办法把洗脑的东西清理掉
So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head

1688
02:18:56,330 --> 02:18:58,600
我想继续沉睡是最好的选择
I think going back under is the best thing,

1689
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:00,980
对所有人都好
... for everybody.

1690
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:24,610
谢谢你帮忙
Thank you for this.

1691
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:29,050
你的朋友和我父亲
Your friend and my father,

1692
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:31,880
他们都是受害者
they were both victims.

1693
02:19:33,460 --> 02:19:36,470
如果我能帮其中一个找到安宁
If I can help one of them find peace.

1694
02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:41,640
如果他们知道他在这儿
You know, if they find out he's here,

1695
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:43,990
就会来抓他
they'll come for him.

1696
02:19:46,410 --> 02:19:47,840
让他们试试吧
Let them try.

1697
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:32,200
是谁啊  是谁打了你

Steve?

1702
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:40,670

- Yikes. - From 12C?

1703
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,040
龅牙那个
With the overbite?

1704
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:44,270
不不不  你不认识他  他布鲁克林的
No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn.

1705
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,780
好吧
Well.

1706
02:26:50,450 --> 02:26:52,130

Yeah, I got quite a few in actually.

1708
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:55,110
好
Okay.

1709
02:26:55,190 --> 02:26:58,360
他朋友块头可大了  可大可大了
His friend was huge. Like huge.

1710
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:03,300
这样好多了  谢谢
That's way better. Thank you.

1711
