00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,599
The lights are off!

3
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,932
Cletus, are you there?

4
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,766
My angel. This is for you.

5
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,266
What did the doctors say?

6
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,932
Mutations progress.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,499
My powers are too great. I'm afraid of Kletus.

8
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:49,966
-Everything will be fine. - They'll get me out of here

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,232
It will take me to a place where there are people like me.

10
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,566
I can't do that.

11
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:04,032
I can't take you, my only light from me!

12
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,566
I will always love you!

13
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,099
Frances!

14
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:10,999
Go away!

15
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:17,299
Frances!

16
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,766
Born!

17
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,199
Born!

18
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,032
One last word?

Will Cletus Kasady receive the death penalty? Police are looking for more dead.

23
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,199
Your ex is finally getting what he deserves.

24
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,266
And the world will be a safer place without him.

25

Venom 2

26
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,999
I don’t want to, but I don’t want to talk to Cletus Kasady.

27
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,499
Too bad he just wants to talk to you.

28
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:01,832
I think you screwed up your first chance with Kasady.

29
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,299
Okay, well ..

30
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,066
What does she want?

31
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,232
Maybe he wants to say something about missing bodies.

32
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:13,932
You need to make the right moves to get this information.

33
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:23,132
Not! Get your little hands off me!

34
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,599
We should be out and deadly guarding the city!

35
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,766
- What was that? - Keep your hands off!

36
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,499
No one should choose to crawl over flying.

37
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,066
To the bottom you are.

38
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,166
I'm silent.

39
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,999
How many times have I told you to hide while I work?

40
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:58,132
I'm serious. It is very important that you respect that!

41
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,266
-Respect? Respect! -That! That!

42
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,499
-ALRIGHT. -ALRIGHT.

43
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,932
- Kassady will screw you, won't he? - What, what do you mean?

44
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,732
-What do you want to say? Because you screw everything up.

45
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,466
- I see you're talking about Anne again. - I missed him!

46
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,666
- I'll do it. -I do not like you.

47
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,866
-Give it to me! -Like!

48
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,099
You don’t deserve good things.

49
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,599
Welcome back Eddie Brock.

50
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,132
I was thinking about you.

51
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:47,566
What do you want? So why am I here?

52
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:53,932
Do you do a favor to this man who is buried alive?

53
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:58,832
Send a message to all fans.

54
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,799
And in return ..

55
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,499
I will give you my life.

56
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,399
-What? -His story.

57
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,699
I've heard that such articles are very popular,

58
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:19,066
Special pieces like this can take you back to where you once were.

59
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,432
Go on.

60
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,066
People ..

61
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,432
He loves serial killers.

62
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,999
Buried ..

63
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,166
All my secrets are Eddie.

64
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,866
There are many massacres in it.

65
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:40,432
Why me?

66
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,432
I liked you.

67
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,766
Well OK. Deal.

68
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,199
What is your message?

69
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,632
That distant cathedral

70
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,699
the only thing I see.

71
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,166
If an angel with a broken wing,

72
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,966
my other part.

73
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,866
wrote this on the front page

74
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,399
Is that all? Who will read this?

75
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,932
These are random things.

76
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,499
Print.

77
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,166
And mine is ..

78
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:21,732
that it is yours.

79
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:23,332
Wow what luck I am

80
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,666
See you, Eddie.

81
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,632
Thank you.

82
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,299
Thank you.

83
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,166
What a dishonest man.

84
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:35,399
Eddie, bak. Iza.

85
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,999
-What are you doing? -Your job.

86
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,966
For you.

87
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,832
In the midst of your suffering ^ Wle'h ^ m otbah ^ to fight.

88
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:47,366
Eddie.

89
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,032
Don't forget me, Eddie.

90
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,366
What do you have?

91
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,699
I have a headache and I probably have tuberculosis.

92
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,099
A little louder.

93
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,199
The man made me write a song.

94
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,999
Is this a joke for you, Eddie? Because I'm not laughing.

95
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,866
A little laughter will come in handy.

96
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:20,366
Come on, these things take time, okay?

97
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:24,366
One moment, let me know, Eddie. -Surely.

98
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,866
Don't embarrass me!

99
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,166
-Do you understand? The only thing you will eat today.

100
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,099
Double chocolate ice cream.

101
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,132
Not! My brain is freezing!

102
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,499
Come here.

103
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,566
-Watch. -I'm watching.

104
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,632
Take this.

105
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:47,232
Well OK.

106
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,932
What do you mean now?

107
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,966
- I'm Pablo Picasso. -Not!

108
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,332
-ALRIGHT. - Come here, look.

109
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,999
Say what you saw.

110
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,299
- He has a house! -Forget it!

111
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:21,632
I know that! It's a tree!

112
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,599
Stupid. Sit there.

113
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:26,032
Sad..

114
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,799
pay attention.

115
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,699
Bingo.

116
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:54,599
Wow.

117
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,332
I wonder if it was because of your friendship with Kasady that you managed to solve the mystery all these years?

118
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:09,332
You are the only person he talks to from the outside world.

119
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,366
- Like he loves you. - He's a serial killer, I don't know how he can love someone.

120
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,666
Brock revealed that police and FBI1 could not find him.

121
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,799
The Governor of California, bowing to the growing anger of the public.

122
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:27,932
He changed his mind and ordered Kasady's execution.

123
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:38,132
Brock’s journalism would revive, which brought him back to the top.

124
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:44,766
oo O

125
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,766
This story finally comes to a conclusion.

126
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:02,566
Victims' rights and the search for their families are finally achieving their goal. Thanks to one person.

127
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,199
- Thanks, Eddie Brock. - My name is Venom.

128

nPABMJlO: 1

129
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,566
This can't be us, Eddie?

130
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:14,766
We'll solve cases in the outside world, fight bad guys, maybe I'll eat them.

131
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,166
And we saved the day.

132
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,466
We saved the day, it's over.

133
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,732
You said I could eat bad guys!

134
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:28,066
- Is this the case again? - I have to be free.

135
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:33,166
I don’t feel the wind in my hair and the sun in my feet.

136
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,999
- You don't have hair. ■ You are not listening to me.

137
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,132
I'm listening.

138
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,266
I can't live like this anymore!

139
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,632
- I'm starving! -Eat these!

140
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:47,299
I can't eat. Sonny and Cher are very close friends.

141
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,699
Are you serious? This is ridiculous.

142
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,399
They call it harassment.

143
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,466
They call it harassment.

144
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,366
And that's a $ 2,000 TV.

145
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,032
You have to control yourself, that's why this tire is here!

146
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,766
I can’t live off chicken and chocolate all the time!

147
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,266
- I need a brain! Chickens have brains.

148
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,266
I passionately reject this.

149
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:17,166
Look at! Look at these poor idiots!

150
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,199
-Little minds. - It's not their fault that you like things ...

151
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,399
To live for phenylethia ..

152
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,499
Phenylethylalanin.

153
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:32,699
I’ve told you a thousand times that it’s only in the brain and chocolate.

154
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,132
True. How about that? If you live in my body

155
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,566
Live by my rules.

156
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,432
- I live in your body because, - What?

157
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,332
Unfortunately I don’t have many options.

158
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:50,899
How about that, son? The FBI is still chasing the case we're "involved in,"

159
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:55,832
If another head is lost, it will throw us into area 51.

160
00:14:56,233 --> 00:15:00,566
They're going to kill us both, so someone has to take responsibility.

161
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,032
Responsibility.

162
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,732
It's for the media.

163
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,332
-Eat! - Can you stop that?

164
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,199
-Eat! -Leave it.

165
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,866
-Eat! Eat! Eat! - Come on, stop it.

166
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,699
damn ok!

167
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,232
- Good evening, Eddie. - Hello, Miss Chen.

168
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,266
Good evening, Venom.

169
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,966
- He said hello. The chocolate hasn't arrived yet.

170
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:30,899
-Not. -Not!

171
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,699
We had a deal.

172
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,632
What are you going to do? Will you stop protecting me?

173
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:40,032
I don't think so. I keep my tongue between my teeth, keeping your little secret.

174
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,032
Wow!

175
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,899
Old Mrs. Chen is blackmailing us!

176
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,799
How old is I, I am 39 years old!

177
00:15:46,933 --> 00:15:48,399
Ben from Barry Manilow!

178
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,032
-Also. - I'd like to eat Mrs. Chen!

179
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,399
No no. You can't eat Mrs. Chen.

180
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:54,499
Born?

181
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,032
I think we will plan B.

182
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,199
What is Plan B?

183
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:03,832
Is that it again!

184
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:07,132
I need a human brain to survive!

185
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,132
Let's go get the chickens!

186
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,766
I'm sick of this disgust!

187
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,399
Take a look at the amazing things we can do!

188
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,966
We are losing our talent!

189
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,899
Bad man!

190
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:54,632
Hello!

191
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:55,599
What a pity.

192
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,732
Let it go, let it go. Leave that!

193
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,899
- I'll rip your head off! - No, you won't.

194
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:08,866
- I'll make it out of a bowling ball! - No, you won't!

195
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:12,399
I'll take him to what, Eddie, who was our favorite?

196
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:15,732
-Lucky Strike! -Evet! Lucky Strike!

197
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:20,199
I’ll take him to Lucky Strike and score 300 points!

198
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:26,766
The rest of his body will stay here, rolling in the trash cans!

199
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,299
No, take it! No no no!

200
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,432
No, don't do that!

201
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,832
Alright!

202
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,132
He didn't want our help.

203
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:45,799
Eddie didn't know he needed our help, there was a difference.

204
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,766
Mom is calling!

205
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:54,132
Mom's on the phone, Eddie!

206
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,099
-Hey, mom. - Hey, Eddie, hello.

207
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,432
Be gentle with her.

208
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,099
You look out of breath, I didn't call you at the wrong time, did I?

209
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,666
No, not definitely. I just...

210
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,699
- I'm hanging out. -ALRIGHT.

211
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,799
I'm sorry I didn't return your calls, I guess.

212
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:21,199
After beheading the alien, I needed space.

213
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,532
Oh, where are your days!

214
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,899
- Anyway, I have some news, can we talk? -That!

215
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,332
Yes, of course big .. It would be nice.

216
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,266
Yes, of course that would be nice.

217
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,866
-Okay, great. How is tomorrow night? -Tomorrow night ..

218
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,399
- Yes, very good. - How's 20:00?

219
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,566
- In our restaurant? -Okay, great.

220
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,666
-I can not wait. See you too.

221
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,899
-Wonderful. - They broke up with the doctor!

222
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,832
It was definitely the voice of a woman who had just been beaten!

223
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,499
-Do not do that! - Don't you want to look your best?

224
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,732
Leave me alone, you're always confused.

225
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,732
Wow!

226
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,466
Hi.

227
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,699
Hi.

228
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:13,666
Gives?

229
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,299
How?

230
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:20,966
Garipsin?

231
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,532
- And what's up? How is Mr. Belvedere? -Good good..

232
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,732
He's still wiping his ass on the carpet, he learned from you.

233
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,599
-Yes, how's the legal aid business going?

234
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,399
You know how much I love the oppressed.

235
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,032
Yes, and with me, that's why it took me so long.

236
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,232
If you say so.

237
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,799
I thought it would be better to say this face to face.

238
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:53,966
Born!

239
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,866
Wow.

240
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,066
Mom, this is ..

241
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,199
Much bigger than the one I got you.

242
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,466
It is very pompous.

243
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:05,599
Dan, right? Dr. Dan?

244
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,332
- Yes, Dr. Dan. - Fuck you, Mom!

245
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,366
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

246
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,699
I'm not that good.

247
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,199
Just "congratulations, I'm happy for you." You could say.

248
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:21,999
Like two people who still care about each other so the other doesn’t feel like shit?

249
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,499
-Maybe we can do it this way? -Yes ..

250
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,232
I'm glad for you mom ..

251
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,999
-Not. -Congratulations.

252
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:32,832
-Thank you. - It was supposed to be us, Eddie!

253
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:40,366
I am not responsible if Dan loses his head, feet and all teeth in a car accident!

254
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,266
-What? What was that?

255
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,199
What? None.

256
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,832
I asked you a question, can you answer correctly?

257
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,366
I'm not very happy, you got engaged and you lied to me ..

258
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:59,532
- It's seriously confusing ... - Is Venom with you?

259
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,999
- He's dead. That. - I'm dead, I'm playing dead now.

260
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,232
-Alright. -Alright.

261
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,899
This.

262
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,966
You never change, do you?

263
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:18,299
What do you mean? That just shocked me.

264
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:23,032
-I love you mom. It is not easy to digest. - You don't really like anyone.

265
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,899
Loyalty is not what you think it is.

266
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,399
Ok then.

267
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,399
Don't marry Dan.

268
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,132
Dan makes me feel safe.

269
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,632
You made me feel like I was on a Ferris.

270
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:37,966
I don't know when to land.

271
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,532
-Yes Yes. -Disgusting.

272
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,266
It's not disgusting. Disgusting.

273
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,732
Hey, Venom?

274
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,766
Will you take good care of him?

275
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,599
Don’t let it all screw up again.

276
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,999
I'll make you cry now, Eddie.

277
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,699
She will adore him. Cry, cry.

278
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,899
It is very difficult to digest.

279
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:06,366
Congratulations, Mom.

280
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,332
Very good news.

281
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:20,832
-Slow d®Wm! -Why?

282
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,232
-Slow down, man! -Why?

283
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,932
No results!

284
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:31,099
If I get hurt, get well, if I get drunk, fix it. Even if I try, I can’t hurt!

285
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:43,499
I'm sorry I couldn't heal your heart, Eddie.

286
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,732
Emotional pain is much more severe.

287
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,532
And it lasts longer.

288
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,199
You have to come together and accept that.

289
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:58,332
- It's easy for you to say. -Why?

290
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:03,532
Because I'm real, you just stopped by

291
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:09,399
I’m not talking about this just because it hurts right now.

292
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:17,132
Don't worry man, I'll help you get through this.

293
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:28,399
You know what makes me happy in the morning, Eddie?

294
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:32,232
Sausage and brain!

295
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,799
I say both of them, so do I.

296
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:41,532
Nobody, nobody, nobody.

297
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:44,499
Let's put a full stop.

298
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,032
I also like potatoes and tomatoes. I love tomatoes too.

299
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:56,432
Potatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes, let's put an end to his prison sentence!

300
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,732
Cheer up an old friend!

301
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:04,632
But if we put an end to everything, we have to part.

302
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,199
This is for you.

303
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,132
An invitation to the ant house?

304
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,466
This is something different.

305
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,132
My dear dear friend.

306
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:27,566
With this letter you ..

307
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:35,032
Until my death, until my last moments in this shit called Earth.

308
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:40,732
I invite you to testify.

309
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:47,199
You are responsible for bringing Cletus Kasady to this goal.

310
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:53,032
The truth is, just hold the door to my exit.

311
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,899
As at my birth, it will stop my heart.

312
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:01,999
What if Cletus Kasady never came back to life?

313
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,599
He never pushed his grandmother down the stairs.

314
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:13,332
Come on, funny boy.

315
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:17,299
He never threw the dryer in his mother's bathtub.

316
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,432
Yes, mother, I am a very bad child.

317
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,299
His father never beat him until he was on the verge of death.

318
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,166
And Saint Estes was never sent home as an unwanted child.

319
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:41,432
He's in a hell of a circus.

320
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,866
sa d> e bi r- pa rd ak ışık va rd i.

321
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,566
Eddie, we all came into this world with blood and pain.

322
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:04,066
Every hero has an original story.

323
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,232
Your friend,

324
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:14,732
Cletus Kasady. A kiss, a hug. A kiss, a hug.

325
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:17,699
Smile.

326
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:21,266
Kisses ga.

327
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,099
- I'm from Alton there. - No, that's a bad idea.

328
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,299
I made it like this.

329
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:31,466
In fact, he did it himself until he went completely insane.

330
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:32,432
Tadaa!

331
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,599
It would be nice to have support once.

332
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:37,666
Ketchup?

333
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:42,232
This place is like all the places you can eat!

334
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,632
Who cares if I take a few of these idiots?

335
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:48,732
You can't be sure who's to blame, man. - They're in jail!

336
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:52,866
Yes, but some make false statements, some are not so guilty.

337
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:54,699
- They're not all killers. - Are you okay, man?

338
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:55,899
Yes, I practice.

339
00:26:56,567 --> 00:27:00,732
I'm a hunter, Eddie. This cannot be done with salad.

340
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:05,566
You know how to eat that bacon, don't lie.

341
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,832
No problem.

342
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:09,366
- You're bullshit! - You're bullshit!

343
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,032
I do not understand?

344
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:15,032
I have no explanation for this, I have a panic attack.

345
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,532
Am I signing here?

346
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,732
Keep at least 50 cm from the bar, do not touch the perpetrator.

347
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:23,999
I understand.

348
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,499
You have a visitor!

349
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:39,366
- This is me, not me. - It's all yours anyway.

350
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,899
Have a nice day, Eddie Brock.

351
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:50,432
What a beautiful treat to end my tour of magical misery.

352
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:57,599
I'm worried about your soul, how does it feel to live life by pulling it out?

353
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,966
I was hoping you would give details of the cases.

354
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:05,932
You're such a prankster, aren't you?

355
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,666
No need, my memory was great

356
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,566
You are rude.

357
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,466
Results.

358
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,099
Behind every decision you make.

359
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:25,666
Who do we live behind and how do we live?

360
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:31,799
In a double bed, empty in the dark,

361
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,066
The one who will never come because of you ..

362
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,432
I'm waiting for that savior.

363
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,232
This man is upset

364
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:44,266
You and I are the same.

365
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,699
No, no we didn't.

366
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:51,999
Our inner world is distorted and we grew up with difficult fathers, you are like home to me.

367
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:57,766
you are like family. And all I really want is ...

368
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:02,166
- .. it was a family. - Kill your grandmother and mother,

369
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:03,799
An interesting way to show it.

370
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:10,132
First of all, you want to drop your burden.

371
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,999
Is there something?

372
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,732
That. I want to make a wish for you.

373
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,166
She's skinny.

374
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:27,166
I wish you..

375
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,232
- This is a broken heart. - It's too late for him.

376
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:37,799
I hope you see how lonely your days are always.

377
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,266
Watch out, man.

378
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,632
Where do you want to go?

379
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:46,099
You're a cancer to anyone who's ever loved you, Eddie.

380
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:50,032
An ex-fiancée you trusted and ...

381
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,199
Dad, you were just born to his wife, your mother

382
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:59,232
It is obvious why he could not look at his face after he killed him.

383
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,932
Son of a bitch!

384
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,866
No no no!

385
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,799
Talk to my landlord again! Come on!

386
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,566
Hello Hello!

387
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,332
No touching! Refuse!

388
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,266
Eddie?

389
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:26,299
-By far. I've already tasted blood, man, and this is something different.

390
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:31,832
- Eddie Brock has a big secret. - Shut up, Kasady.

391
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:44,832
- Maybe you were wrong. -Shut up.

392
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,399
Aren't you Eddie Brock?

393
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,566
I don't know anymore.

394
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,299
-Eddie! - I don't want another word.

395
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,199
-Eddie! - I'm not listening.

396
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:58,466
Eddie, I'm sorry.

397
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,799
This was the last shot of the man.

398
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,699
There will be no other information about what they killed and left behind,

399
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:12,132
-and those who lost loved ones forever .. -I didn't do it on purpose!

400
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,766
- Didn't you do it on purpose? - I apologized too!

401
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,066
You didn't do it on purpose, but you did.

402
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:18,299
Suddenly you did things like this.

403
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:21,966
If only we could be caught, if only we could die! you didn't mean.

404
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,566
Think only of the chickens, of yourself, of yourself.

405
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:29,832
Let me remind you of something, Eddie. you before me

406
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,932
you were a loser. You were nothing, I made you special!

407
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,832
Did you make me special? Let me tell you, I had a life before you came.

408
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:42,266
Yes, there was no chicken, but I had dreams, a fiancée and a successful TV show!

409
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,566
You destroyed them all yourself.

410
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,832
Yes, but I have restored it and I want to live it. Good night.

411
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,732
How did you build that new life? -Sorry?

412
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:57,099
Who found the clue? Who made you a hero?

413
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,332
Who found the clue? WHO?

414
00:32:00,267 --> 00:32:02,199
-Wow. Just.

415
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,566
No, no, it's not about being a hero to me.

416
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,432
It's about living in peace. do you understand what i said

417
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,199
You don't understand, it's about wanting to live without you

418
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:23,832
from wanting to constantly eat bad guys by ear or about mom

419
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,932
It’s about giving a speech, about destroying my home and my life!

420
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,966
Do you know how happy you are that I chose you?

421
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,066
Did you choose me?

422
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:37,966
Dude, I was the only one who accepted you when your friends turned you down!

423
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:41,632
You are excluded! He wanted to protect me, you can't protect anything!

424
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,766
You are useless! All you have to do is clean the toilet!

425
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:50,032
I'm sorry, I don't know how it happened, let me fix it.

426
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,066
-It's on fire. That. - It was a busy day.

427
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,332
Son of a bitch!

428
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,932
Exit! Get out! Take your things and go!

429
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,732
This is my house!

430
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,766
Be quiet!

431
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,132
Get out!

432
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,332
Sonny?

433
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,699
- You can't do that. -Definitely.

434
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,666
No no no!

435
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,266
-Yes! -No!

436
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:46,532
- I'm calling the police! - I'm very sad.

437
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:51,599
Well that's it ..

438
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,866
You can't win.

439
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,799
Look at yourself and yourself.

440
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,066
Skinny.

441
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:14,599
How dare you!

442
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,366
I guess it’s time to say goodbye.

443
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:24,699
Yes, we finally agreed on something!

444
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,966
What the hell is that?

445
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:55,199
No no no.

446
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,032
Born!

447
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:00,466
Gives!

448
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,766
Born!

449
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,466
-Yes! -No!

450
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,532
Just!

451
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,532
Sad..

452
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:16,699
No no no.

453
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:19,099
Never come back!

454
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,532
Goodbye!

455
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:40,666
Cletus Kasady, the state of California has sentenced you to death.

456
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:50,232
May your death be a consolation to the relatives of the victims, and then find peace.

457
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,499
Chaos will come soon.

458
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,366
There will be chaos soon.

459
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,466
Are these your last words?

460
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:02,399
Enjoy!

461
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:42,499
My boss?

462
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,399
Something ...

463
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,632
He wants to get out of here!

464
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,332
Empty this place!

465
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:15,666
stay put!

466
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,632
Hey!

467
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,599
Please ..

468
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,832
I have a family.

469
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,732
Do you have the last word, Director?

470
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,499
Please! Do not do that!

471
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,799
Saint Quentin rotted in hell.

472
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,766
Everybody roll over, I'll come back and explain.

473
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,666
I come out stronger and wiser.

474
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,666
And when I eat Manager, I remember the ham.

475
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,666
RULES, PEOPLE DO NOT EAT

476
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:46,366
You two have been evicted.

477
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,866
Don't look at me like that, I wouldn't walk with you anyway.

478
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:01,066
Alright?

479
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,632
Gives.

480
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:21,266
At the last minute, serial killer Cletus Kasady escaped from prison,

481
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,666
and the search for people across the country continues.

482
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,199
-Fuck! - From Saint Quentin Prison.

483
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,432
-Hey. - You're not dead.

484
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,399
-That. Can I come in?

485
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,699
Yes of course. Get inside.

486
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:50,699
I just saw it on the news.

487
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:54,066
1 to 10 this is a danger to 11 people.

488
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:58,199
The reports from Saint Quentin are utter madness.

489
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,566
-Nice TV. - How did he do that?

490
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:03,132
Yes, how did he do it?

491
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:04,532
It's a million dollar question.

492
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,566
But you were his special visitor. What did he tell you?

493
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,166
For me? Nothing. Not.

494
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:15,832
What about the escape plan? Or the system he adjusts?

495
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:23,199
How come you have no idea about the jobs you are in?

496
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,599
Maybe I'm lucky.

497
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:27,299
Yes of course.

498
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:34,866
Your reports from Saint Quentin ...

499
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,532
You said you were crazy, how come?

500
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,732
Did you ask him such questions?

501
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,999
Knowledge is our most valuable asset, people like you need to know it.

502
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,799
Come on.

503
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:57,899
I thought she would find the man who nearly killed her, but I was wrong.

504
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,132
I'll be around, I'll go out alone.

Think, think, think. What would Venom do?

507
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,732
He would find her and eat her in the face before she found us!

508
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,066
Can we leave how we lived?

509
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:31,366
The empty double bed was left to rot. - Is this a marriage?

510
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:35,299
waiting for his savior, who will never come, in the dark.

511
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,466
The remote cathedral is quiet because of you.

512
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:45,066
- You and me, we're the moon. -Bright light.

513

His inner world is distorted, heavy dad, you were like home to me.

Damn it! Another fell!

517
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:36,432
Look at these freaks.

518
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:38,899
What do people do?

519
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:41,366
Beautiful costume!

520
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:44,499
Hey! Great!

521
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,266
This is the best costume! Oh my God!

522
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:51,699
-Japanese business? - No, I made it myself.

523
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:52,632
Hey!

524
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:58,099
-Hey beauty! I'm sorry, he's not my type.

525
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:01,999
I finally got out of Eddie’s locker!

526
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,166
Hello Beautiful.

527
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:34,032
Frances should see this.

528
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,899
Let's start the party.

529
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,666
Just.

530
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:50,832
Hard, hard, hard!

531
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,766
Stop, fuck!

532
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:01,666
- You're real. -It's me.

533
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,866
And when I kill the thing that created me, we will be indestructible.

534
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:16,332
I know where you can find it, but first we need to find something I lost.

535
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:18,966
-Deal. -Deal.

Thanks!

539
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,199
- We're screwed. - Your costume is beautiful!

540
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:21,499
Thanks to one person!

541
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:25,299
Eddie was wrong!

542
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:30,466
He hid me because he was ashamed of me!

543
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,366
But look at me now, they love me!

544
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,632
And I'm free!

545
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:41,466
-Hi! -As!

546
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:47,066
Leave this rude behavior to the aliens. This is very false.

547
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:52,999
We can all live together in this stone sphere.

548
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:58,366
Let's show who we are free!

549
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,432
-I love you! -Me too!

550
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,366
Yes Yes

551
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,399
The deadly guard is fleeing!

552
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,332
It was a difficult conversation to follow.

553
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,499
I wish you could see me tonight.

554
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:28,032

-Mulligan? -Ben Eddie Brock ..

558
00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:24,166
It may not be related, but I think I found something.

559
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,432
The last time we talked to Kasady, he talked about the double bed and marriage.

560
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:33,299
It didn't make sense, but when I came to his house ...

561
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:38,066
here is a tree and

563

Whoever this "FB" is may know where he's going.

564
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:55,832
And if you look at his files or something, you might find them.

565
00:49:56,867 --> 00:50:02,166
- It's "FB" Frances Barrison. - It was fast.

566
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:07,799
That's not possible, Eddie. He died. I fired.

567
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:48,866
Can I help you, sir?

568
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:07,432
Do you understand the internet?

You're alive.

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,766
When I get out of here, I’ll cut off your face and wear it like a mask!

572
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,066
You'll never get out of here, Siegfried.

573
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:44,732
No one can come out.

574
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:50,632
Frances,

575
00:51:51,633 --> 00:51:56,199
It's like your girlfriend was juggling St. Quentin.

576
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:02,399
The news revolves around this. Don’t get excited though.

577
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:05,066
They won't be able to find you.

578
00:52:08,867 --> 00:52:09,999
Fuck you.

579
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,732
I'm honored. But you're not my type.

580
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:16,232
Where is he?

581
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:20,899
I'm in front of you.

582
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:46,432
Hello baby.

583
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:54,366
I don't want to scare you.

584
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:58,499
But there is someone I want to introduce you to.

585
00:52:58,533 --> 00:52:59,532
Carnage.

586
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,732

Stop! You're killing him!

If he does it again, I'll bite him in the face.

You know what I mean? What are you still not sure about Kasady?

How does Eddie do it?

Do you know what secrets they want, Eddie? To go outside.

That’s why it’s so hard to hold on.

How worried should I be?

I screwed up.

- How bad is it? It couldn't have been worse and it's all my fault.

Whatever you did, you should tell the police.

No, no, I can't say. There are aliens in the serial killer they are chasing.

It can kill anyone.

Not here.

- Fire on Saint Estes, all units. -Hey mom ..

654
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,666
I don't know, all I know is that without food

655
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,032
He can’t escape and eats only chicken and chocolate.

656
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:48,232
If it's still the same.

657
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:53,366
We have to find him.

658
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,632
I have to find him.

659
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:59,499
Yes, find him, and I'll fix everything.

660
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:01,532
-I will try. -Thank you.

661
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:06,866
- Banyan Chen. -Which pita?

662
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:07,299
-Just me. -What do you want

663
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,299
-Just me. -What do you want?

664
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:12,532
-Your love -Look ..

665
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,499
You broke Eddie's heart. - I don't have time for this right now,

666
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,466
Do you know where Venom is?

667
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:20,866
- Are you going to break her heart too? I'm not going to say who did what to whom,

668
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:24,932
Eddie said he might have come here for chocolate. I need to talk to an alien.

669
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,999
- You said there were no aliens. - Just don't worry.

670
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:29,466
MM «MM PHC1M IMMIOlMtlV

671
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:30,599
Can you turn up the volume, please?

672
01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:36,532
Kasady and Barrison are armed and very dangerous.

673
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:39,666
The search continues tonight.

674
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:41,999
-Ee? -Cletus'da simbiyot var.

675
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:45,299
God, are there any more pathological lies you will tell?

676
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,066
-Pussy. -I do not understand?

677
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:49,266
Eddie needs Venom. - He called me a cunt, that's it.

678
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:52,599
He didn't need it. Life is better without him.

679
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:54,399
I don't understand why you care so much, but ...

680
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,299
One second.

681
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,499
Get out fast!

682
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,932
-See? Do you see this now? Yes, honey, I saw it.

683
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,432
Let Eddie fight that battle his bitch.

684
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,632
- You're becoming a big baby, help your friend. - I was just fixing the toilet.

685
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:21,599
Cletus will come after you, he can't survive without you.

686
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:26,332
Of course not, because we are both our heroes.

687
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,466
Yes, you are a great sexy hero.

688
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:36,999
You are the coldest, the warmest and the bravest.

689
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,632
It's me.

690
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,166
I'm still standing here.

691
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,999
Nobody loves you Dan!

692
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:45,032
I love seeing you in action.

693
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:51,866
Let's save this bastard.

694
01:01:58,033 --> 01:02:01,366
I promised you we'd get out of here.

695
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,599
And let's go to the cathedral.

696
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,666
-Wedding. -Three guests.

697
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,166
One for all of us.

698
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:15,466
The cop who took my eyes off me.

699
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,166
Eddie Brock.

700
01:02:18,433 --> 01:02:19,232
I ...

701
01:02:19,267 --> 01:02:20,499
• UJ0IJ9A

702
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,199
Bloody wedding.

703
01:02:29,433 --> 01:02:30,399
Can't find him?

704
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,666
my God.

705
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:45,732
What happened?

706
01:02:47,467 --> 01:02:48,732
He came from the next room.

707
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,566
Hello Dan.

708
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:01,966
-Let's go. - I'm not talking to him!

709
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,499
- He doesn't want to go out. - How can he not, we have to go now ..

710
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:10,032
- or Cletus will destroy the city. I don't do anything until he apologizes.

711
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,499
He apologizes, I know it's none of your business.

712
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:17,732
- Now, now? - I want him to pray.

713
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,232
Well OK. I'll be bigger than us.

714
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,332
I will always be bigger, but keep going.

715
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,199
What is he saying? What does he say?

716
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:31,132
- All right, listen to this, I'm sorry. - The tone didn't match.

717
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:33,966
-Sorry. -Not.

718
01:03:34,967 --> 01:03:36,432
Sorry.

719
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:37,999
Very strange.

720
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,266
-Sorry! I don't understand why you're yelling at me.

721
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,232
All right, before I met you, I was a loser.

722
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,032
-That's it. - And now I have a personality.

723
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:52,466
And you made me special

724
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,799
-Just. - Bring a decoration.

725
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:57,099
Should I decorate? OK.

726
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:02,732
I'm sorry for what I said and what I didn't say.

727
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,966
Bad things I did and things I didn’t do.

728
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:11,499
He thinks.

729
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:13,599
Come on, come on, come on.

730
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:16,899
ALRIGHT!

731
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:21,799
- I can't be. -Kiss her!

732
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,999
- You can kiss me. -Not.

733
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,899
Not! God, I will never do this again.

734
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,366
Obviously very strange.

735
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,466
If we save the day, will we be called the Deadly Protector?

736
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,166
Very 80s.

737
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,799
-Day, go now and if something happens .. -Fire and sound.

738
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,066
Fire and sound? Is that the name of the group?

739
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:42,599
No, it kills them.

740
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,699
All right, look man, I'll take care of it.

741
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,866
I'm not sad!

742
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,999
I'm very sad.

743
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,166
These two have to go to relationship therapy.

744
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,732
I'm going to Brock's house.

745
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,599
Fuck.

746
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:11,166
Kasady, put your hands on your head!

747
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,599
Which ...

748
01:05:15,067 --> 01:05:16,499
my hands?

749
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:24,999
We found you.

750
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,832
Your screamer will be delighted.

751
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,799
Brock'cuğum!

752
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,399
That is it.

753
01:05:58,433 --> 01:06:00,432
You're for this finger.

754
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:09,866
Beautiful and bright.

755
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:12,266
That piqued my interest.

756
01:06:19,167 --> 01:06:19,932
• lueıueı

757
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,199
Let's go, man.

758
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,799
Hi mom, I knocked out your boyfriend.

759
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:39,199
As long as you tell me where Eddie Brock is, it's okay.

760
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:44,932
- I'll tell you for sure. - It's sad to hurt you.

761
01:06:51,567 --> 01:06:55,266
Tell Brock Cletus he wants a replacement.

762
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:58,166
For his head, hers.

763
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,466
They will both kill you.

764
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,232
Many have already tried it

765
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,799
They screwed up!

766
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,332
I can't find him!

767
01:07:19,433 --> 01:07:20,866
They're looking for us too, man.

768
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:24,899
Come on, where are you?

769
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,566
-Hey Dan, what's going on? - They took him, Eddie.

770
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:36,599
- They took Anne! -Calm down.

771
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,932
Water is at the wedding. - Where did they get it?

772
01:07:39,067 --> 01:07:41,799
-For a wedding. At Grace Cathedral, hurry up. - We're on our way.

773
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,732
-Like going to a wedding. - Will there be a snack?

774
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:48,566
Be sure he will.

775
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,832
This distant cathedral

776
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,899
the only thing I see.

777
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,966
An angel with a broken wing,

778
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:38,166
my other part.

779
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,232
-Dear guests .. -First gifts.

780
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,132
- Actually traditional ... - Shut up.

781
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:50,699
Peder.

782
01:08:51,133 --> 01:08:55,366
Honey, I got you what you want most

783
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,366
- The police? -Police.

784
01:08:58,833 --> 01:09:00,999
- Come on, Father. -Dear guests.

785
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:05,166
If anyone has any objections to this marriage, let them speak now.

786
01:09:05,567 --> 01:09:07,632
or forever ..

787
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,032
Where is the woman?

788
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:15,932
You do

789
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,632
You will die, father.

790
01:09:18,733 --> 01:09:21,166
-Not! - You're not a father.

791
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,732
Father, who is the father.

792
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,832
Fuck!

793
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,766
-What are you doing? What are you doing? - This is much worse than I thought.

794
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,132
This is red. How?

795
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,632
- That means red. - We have to go, really.

796
01:09:34,933 --> 01:09:37,699
Mom got over it, we never loved her anyway.

797
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,166
Go!

798
01:09:39,233 --> 01:09:42,466
New double happiness, we are on the run.

799
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,332
Eddie

800
01:09:44,933 --> 01:09:46,966
I'll be right back, okay?

801
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,699
You have to get out, I feel so vulnerable here.

802
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,832
- Is Brock like you? -Not long.

803
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,699
• Eddie! We are here.

804
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,266
Eddie! We are here.

805
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:03,932
You have to leave now. I'll let you eat everything. You can eat them all!

806
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:07,699
- Not that, the one in the dress. You can't eat that. -Promise?

807
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,032
I promise!

808
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:12,732
Thanks!

809
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,466
My baby.

810
01:10:28,633 --> 01:10:30,866
Shut up.

811
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:34,066
Problems in marriage? Already now?

812
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:37,099
Time to die!

813
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,866
This is the ghost I was looking for!

814
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,966
I say, we will die

815
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:27,266
- I killed you. - You can't kill a ghost.

816
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:33,532
If you kill him, kill him.

817
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:38,599
- But shut up. Our wife knows what she's doing.

818
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,066
Reduce it.

819
01:11:41,167 --> 01:11:43,866
Who do you think you're talking to?

820
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,432
-Stop it! - I'm a cop!

821
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:54,832
A trained man is coming!

822
01:11:59,467 --> 01:12:00,599
Power boost.

823
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:01,632
Born!

Mayday mayday mayday! Kletus Kasady ..

827
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:38,899
What would you say? "An eye for an eye ..."

828
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:51,732
Fire and sound, but no sound.

829
01:12:55,133 --> 01:12:56,099
My baby!

830
01:12:59,267 --> 01:13:00,266
Cletus!

831
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:31,832
Man-man Brock?

832
01:13:38,367 --> 01:13:41,266
Do you know how my countless days went by?

833
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:57,332
Thinking about how you tell one side of the story.

834
01:14:10,433 --> 01:14:17,166
You did not write that Kletus was abused by his mother, father and grandmother!

835
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:55,066
Into a world that no one cares about, that no one is trying to save

836
01:14:56,267 --> 01:15:01,099
You didn't say you were a scared kid!

837
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,466
You never wondered

838
01:15:07,933 --> 01:15:09,132
Why!

839
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,299
This is bad journalism!

840
01:15:20,867 --> 01:15:22,866
Happy days.

841
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:33,699
I'm not crazy.

842
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:38,499
But I'm full of revenge.

843
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:45,132
You will watch him die.

844
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:51,866
Anne!

845
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,799
Anne!

846
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:10,932
Do something!

847
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:16,199
Eddie .. I'm afraid we won't be able to beat them.

848
01:16:21,467 --> 01:16:24,832
Honey, that's too much.

849
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:29,599
- You have to stop him. -What are you doing?

850
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:32,032
I will completely silence him.

851
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,299
No, stop! It hurts!

852
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:42,666
-Stand up! -I can not.

853
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,199
Look, look! They are not suitable for symbiosis.

854
01:16:49,433 --> 01:16:51,632
- Don't touch her! -Shut up.

855
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,399
Get your hands off my wife!

856
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:59,266
- They're not compatible. - We're compatible!

857
01:16:59,733 --> 01:17:01,899
True. We are.

858
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,099
We are together ...

859
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,999
A deadly protector

860
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,899
Totally ..

861
01:18:29,033 --> 01:18:30,566
I will be slaughtered!

862
01:18:37,433 --> 01:18:37,732
s

863
01:18:39,233 --> 01:18:39,599
O

864
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,599
I got you, are you okay?

865
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,099
Born.

866
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:28,266
Dad, one of us has to die.

867
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,632
We need fire.

868
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,166
Or sound.

869
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:55,999
Born!

870
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,932
No way!

871
01:20:48,967 --> 01:20:51,299
There was no good taste!

872
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,499
I'm a killer monster or not, Eddie.

873
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,166
You know what I wanted most?

874
01:21:14,767 --> 01:21:16,599
To wash the dishes?

875
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:21,499
- I told you not to listen to me. - I'm listening to you now.

876
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,166
your friendship.

877
01:21:28,033 --> 01:21:29,432
Sorry Cletus.

878
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,999
Fuck!

879
01:21:56,233 --> 01:21:57,632
You inside, take it.

880
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,366
He will come after you both.

881
01:22:00,967 --> 01:22:01,866
I know.

882
01:22:03,967 --> 01:22:04,766
Hey, Mom.

883
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:06,832
Be careful.

884
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,966
And you are a champion.

885
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:13,366
I!

886
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:15,632
Be careful too.

887
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:18,466
-Thank you. - I caught your eye.

888
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,032
We don't need that.

889
01:22:21,133 --> 01:22:24,099
I think it might be helpful to have it.

890
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:39,566
Monsters ..

891
01:22:49,933 --> 01:22:54,266
Don Coyote was sitting next to him with Sancho Panza.

892
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,666
Very different people who look at the world in two different ways.

893
01:23:00,233 --> 01:23:05,666
They have achieved great things, sometimes they do not get along very well with each other.

894
01:23:07,433 --> 01:23:10,066
But they were together to get the best out of it.

895
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:14,066
Eddie, it's time.

896
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:19,266
I have to go alone. What they want is me.

897
01:23:20,033 --> 01:23:20,832
Like that.

898
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,832
My lover Sancho ..

899
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:28,332
Information is the enemy of facts.

900
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:30,532
What does that mean?

901
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,832
This means ...

902
01:23:34,133 --> 01:23:35,399
That means our ..

903
01:23:36,633 --> 01:23:37,166
our name ..

904
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,532
-And ... -Run!

905
01:23:40,233 --> 01:23:42,799
- Yes, yes, I mean ... - They're on their way!

906
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:43,666
Of course there is.

907
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,666
Thanks for bringing me here.

908
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,399
No problem bro.

909
01:24:03,633 --> 01:24:04,566
Isn't it beautiful?

910
01:24:06,633 --> 01:24:11,166
I am sorry for the feeling of your hair in the wind.

911
01:24:11,433 --> 01:24:15,266
- Osho says that when you love someone ... - So Osho.

912
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:20,566
You love her whole personality. With its downsides.

913
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,066
- With its bad sides? - Nobody's great!

914
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,866
Stop, come back, come back. So you said you loved me?

915
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:29,766
You just said.

916
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,532
- Where are we going? - I don't know, I don't know.

917
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:39,599
I guess that's where the Protector of Mortals is.

918
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,199
- You're serious! -That.

919
01:24:42,467 --> 01:24:45,966
We need a robe and a mask.

920
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,066
No, no, we're so good.
