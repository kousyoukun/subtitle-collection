00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,798
This is my city, Lagos.

3
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,523
Over 21 million people
call this city their home.

4
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,023
Over 21 million people.

5
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,763
Tight pad and pressed together.

6
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,368
Most of us live our lives

7
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,820
without ever really thinking,

8
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:23,721
without ever really seeing,

9
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,728
without ever really understanding

10
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,533
how complicated we are.

11
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:31,561
How connected we are.

12
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:33,563
How very fragile we are.

13
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,647
But then one day, something happens.

14
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:40,305
Something that changes the way you

15
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:41,807
look at the world.

16
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:46,060
Changes the way you see the world.

17
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,226
Changes your life.

18
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:53,415
Forever.

19
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:07,556
Emergency please, emergency please.

20
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:09,641
Please, emergency please.

21
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:13,454
Madam, move please, emergency please.

22
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:14,373
Easy, easy.

23
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,206
Thank you, thank you.

24
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:38,127
Sorry.

25
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:30,085
Ma, I'll try it.

26
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,146
Dr. Morris.

27
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:33,204
Yes. What is it?

28
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,402
This official from the airport,

29
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:36,080
they said he's a diplomat.

30
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:36,915
Okay.

31
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:39,298
Ma.

32
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,109
I'm gonna have to go, I
have lots of work now.

33
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:45,612
Happy birthday darling.

34
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:47,112
Happy birthday dad.

35
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:49,138
Thank you, thank you.

36
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,040
Come, let's eat.

37
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,498
Heavenly Father, thank you for the food

38
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,418
and the hands that prepared it.

39
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,878
Thank you for another year together

40
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,422
and the rich blessings that
you continue to provide.

41
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:10,378
Holy Father, please continue to bless

42
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,898
the staff at First Consultants

43
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,818
and the patients in our care.

44
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,928
Heavenly Father, remember
Mrs. Nimule tonight,

45
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,768
who's awaiting the birth of her first son,

46
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,578
Mr. Marzo as he battles to
beat his lung infection,

47
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,242
Mrs. Obasake, as she
starts dialysis treatment.

48
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,075
Mumsie?

49
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:27,908
Hmm?

50
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,768
The food is getting cold again.

51
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,673
It shall be far colder than it was none.

52
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,708
That doesn't even make sense.

53
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,798
Bless all our patients
and their families, amen.

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,798
Amen.

55
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,888
Amen.

56
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,158
It doesn't have to make sense,

57
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,668
I'm your mother.

58
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,978
I'll have that on a T-shirt.

59
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,316
I'm sure it will sell millions.

60
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,338
It's the hospital.

61
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,299
Ameyo.

62
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,421
It's my birthday.

63
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:53,940
I will only be a minute.

64
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:55,168
Hello, Morris.

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,368
Dad?

66
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,398
100 naira says she gets called in.

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,718
What's the problem?

68
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,495
Hello, well
we have a patient here.

69
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:02,615
A diplomat brought him by, Nick Wass.

70
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:04,828
I've taken his vital signs,

71
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,556
but his temperature is very high.

72
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,028
I've also ordered his tests,

73
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,668
but he's being very impatient.

74
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,310
What does this man from Ecua say?

75
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,378
My assistant he needs to call

76
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,768
because he has a conference,

77
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,816
because he has a conference in Calaba.

78
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:17,988
Well, he's obviously not going

79
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,313
to the conference tonight.

80
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:21,838
Ma, should I call Dr. Ohiaeri?

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,158
No, don't call Ohiaeri.

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,858
He's been working all weekend.

83
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,760
I'll brief him at the morning meeting.

84
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,521
Latest reports

85
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:35,888
from Liberia suggest the reported cases

86
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,188
of Ebola have continued to climb

87
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,808
with that country
already desperately short

88
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,055
of medical equipment and
skilled medical personnel.

89
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,718
Available data puts total number

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,948
of Ebola confirmed deaths in Liberia,

91
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,217
Sierra Leone and Guinea at 11,200.

92
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,736
What a nightmare.

93
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:53,015
I'm sure their whole public
health infrastructure

94
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:55,043
is breaking under all that strain.

95
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,369
Did you ever think about doing that?

96
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:01,948
What?

97
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,950
Public health?

98
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:03,783
Me?

99
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:05,575
Public health is not for me.

100
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,150
Dr. Adadevoh is one of the best

101
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:10,208
endocrinologists in Nigeria.

102
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,368
That's why I went to First
Consultants, remember.

103
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,203
Sure.

104
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,708
So maybe we could talk more

105
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,538
about that baby?

106
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,373
Deal.

107
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:34,078
Have a good day.

108
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,180
You too, babe.

109
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,618
Thank you.

110
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,453
Morning.

111
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,521
Morning.

112
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,463
Oh, how's the baby?

113
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:01,081
Hi.

114
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:06,038
So, you decided to come

115
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,658
to First Consultants after all.

116
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,905
I thought about what you said

117
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:11,838
and decided the commute is worth it.

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,265
But money's much better,?

119
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,004
Welcome to family Justina.

120
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,044
Thank you.

121
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:18,398
When is the baby due?

122
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,497
Six months.

123
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,708
I was even surprised
they offered me the job.

124
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,748
Oh, Dr. Ohiaeri loves babies.

125
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,641
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

126
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:26,985
Good morning everyone.

127
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,570
Good morning sir.

128
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:36,578
Let's find out what kid of day today

129
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,748
will be, shall well.

130
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,998
First, let's welcome Justina Echelonu

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,598
to the family.

132
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,818
Welcome Justina.

133
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,737
Thank you, thank you.

134
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,219
Easy.

135
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:10,410
Put this here.

136
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:13,435
Can you sit up?

137
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,513
I will talk to the doctors.

138
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:20,898
What time the plane Leaving?

139
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,178
11 sir.

140
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,370
Good.

141
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,203
What?

142
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:25,153
My Embassy.

143
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:28,498
Have you spoken to my Embassy again?

144
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,528
Last night.

145
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,448
And again this morning.

146
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,283
Good, go.

147
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,692
Good morning Mr. Sawyer.

148
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,133
I am Dr. Adadevoh.

149
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,361
Dr. Ibeawuchi tells me that you

150
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,268
want to leave us already.

151
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,674
Why so soon?

152
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:56,375
It seems to me like
you're a very sick man.

153
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:59,028
I have important business.

154
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,858
Yes, well, so do we

155
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,518
and once we are done with ours,

156
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,533
you'll be fit and healthy
and ready to do yours, hmm?

157
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,172
Just get on with it.

158
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:11,538
Firstly, are you sure you have had

159
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,653
absolutely no contact with anyone

160
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,488
with Ebola in Liberia?

161
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,147
Doctor, I already told him this.

162
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,547
Why you ask me again?

163
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:20,380
Mr. Sawyer, for us to give you

164
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,018
the best possible treatment,

165
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,128
we must know the right answers.

166
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,888
So, I'll ask you again.

167
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,438
Are you sure that you did not come

168
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,787
into contact with anyone
with Ebola in Liberia?

169
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,338
I'm sure.

170
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,491
So no contact with any dead bodies?

171
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:41,910
Do I look like a gravedigger?

172
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,898
Not at all.

173
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,968
Any
pre-existing conditions.

174
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,705
I already told you malaria.

175
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:51,518
Yes, malaria, that's what you said.

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,648
Listen to me.

177
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,368
I don't want to answer anymore questions.

178
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,678
I have question that needs answers.

179
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,958
When are you people letting me go?

180
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,873
As soon as we're able
to make you feel better.

181
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,501
Please take those things my study.

182
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:21,248
Mumsie, welcome, how's traffic?

183
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,298
Terrible.

184
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,078
When is not terrible?

185
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,888
Is your father home yet?

186
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,721
Traffic.

187
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,828
Obviously, I'm going to work.

188
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,663
Sure.

189
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:35,793
Bankole, I love you.

190
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,458
Ma?

191
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,293
Just that.

192
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,168
Mumsie, are you okay?

193
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,128
I'm fine.

194
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,103
It's.

195
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:46,853
It's been a stressful day.

196
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:49,408
Dr. Benwa has been giving you

197
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,904
a hard time again, has he?

198
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:52,103
No, it's not that.

199
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,225
It's a patient from last night.

200
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,985
The diplomat.

201
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:59,368
He's sick, but worse than I thought.

202
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,618
Worse like how?

203
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,248
Worse like he says it's malaria,

204
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,823
but it's not malaria.

205
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:08,093
And he just came in from Liberia?

206
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,048
It's not Ebola, right?

207
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,858
It's not like he's some farmer

208
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,468
from one of the villages.

209
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,218
He's a diplomat.

210
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,597
So probably not.

211
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,477
Almost certainly not.

212
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:06,944
One of those days?

213
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,223
Today I feel old.

214
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:16,273
One of those days I wish I was out

215
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,463
of the big picture.

216
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,393
Maybe teaching, just taking it easy.

217
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,103
Well, so yes, we agreed that.

218
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:30,660
Yes, soon, we agreed.

219
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:41,070
Will you come to bed, soon?

220
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:43,482
Don't be too long.

221
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,268
Has the patient been fully informed

222
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,888
about your recommendations?

223
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,046
He has.

224
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:52,273
And is he of sound mind?

225
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,033
It appears so, yes.

226
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,070
And does he still
express a desire to leave

227
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:59,338
in spite of the advice of his physician?

228
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,511
Amos, I don't.

229
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:02,033
Answer the question.

230
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:04,068
Yes, he wants to leave.

231
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,908
I told you he wants to leave.

232
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,088
So he's entitled to do that.

233
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,164
Look, this is not even a hard question.

234
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,228
It is simple, clinical governance.

235
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,858
There's nothing simple
about this, Doctor.

236
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,860
Dr. Adadevoh, Amos isn't questioning

237
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:22,503
your passion or your brilliance.

238
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,208
We all know you're brilliant.

239
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,848
What he's saying is a first-year lecture.

240
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,038
The patient has rights.

241
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,386
I spent the night
reading everything I could.

242
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:36,768
I looked at his blood work, his charts,

243
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,388
his records, everything we have.

244
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,078
Which is almost nothing.

245
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,048
That's exactly my point.

246
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,288
While he tested positive for malaria,

247
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,058
the anti-malaria and the analgesic

248
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,253
are having no effect.

249
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:54,348
His liver enzymes are
showing a marked elevation.

250
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,268
White blood cell count is down.

251
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,608
Even platelet count is down.

252
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,808
That is not at all
consistent with malaria.

253
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,075
Go on, all true.

254
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:06,858
Negative for
Hep A and B and HIV.

255
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,474
His temperature is closer to 40 than 39.

256
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,858
And he's suffering from
acute diarrhea and vomiting.

257
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,038
Look, the man himself told us

258
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,378
he has had no contact with Ebola.

259
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,518
Patients lie.

260
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,428
Why would a man lie
about something like that?

261
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,522
Why do men do anything?

262
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,078
People do stupid things
in terrible situations.

263
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,913
We know this.

264
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:30,068
And what is happening in Liberia right now

265
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,181
is the most terrible
situation one can imagine.

266
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,918
And why would he want

267
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,920
to run away from a hospital
if there is even a chance.

268
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,343
It makes no sense.

269
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,734
Look, I am not saying this is Ebola.

270
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,218
I can't say that.

271
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,538
Not as a medical certainty,

272
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,573
not even as strong conjecture.

273
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,108
But I can say, with due respect.

274
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,098
This is my specialty, is this.

275
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,448
This is a viral infection.

276
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,606
A serious infection.

277
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:09,608
Very possibly, if not
certainly, hemorrhagic.

278
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,843
So, Ebola then.

279
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:18,823
I worked all night, this morning.

280
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,488
I couldn't kiss my child goodbye before

281
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,174
leaving the house.

282
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:27,018
I haven't touched this man.

283
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,398
I've only been in the
same room with his twice

284
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,033
and I hesitated to kiss my own child.

285
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:38,153
I think I'm right.

286
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,333
I know I am.

287
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,938
In the same first year lecture,

288
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,840
all those years ago, they spoke about,

289
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,497
the one law that superseded

290
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:55,068
the patient's individual rights.

291
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,178
There aren't many things
more in the public good

292
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,596
than preventing a possible Ebola outbreak.

293
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:02,258
What if we're wrong?

294
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,758
If we're wrong,

295
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,018
if we're wrong, we have to demonstrate

296
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,719
that we acted in good faith using

297
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:11,058
the best information available.

298
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,451
Well, we may have to do that in court.

299
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:16,651
And even then, in a case like this,

300
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:18,811
a rich and powerful friend,

301
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:21,605
legal justification just
might not be enough.

302
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,027
Just what justification can we give

303
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:28,110
if we let this man go and it
turns out to be infectious?

304
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,958
The question here is a simple one Amos.

305
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,363
Do we trust her judgment
to make this decision?

306
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,998
Hello, Dr. Ada.

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,318
Justina, how are you?

308
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,787
Fine.

309
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,998
I hope you're settling in okay?

310
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,716
Yes, I think so.

311
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:48,898
Dr. Igonoh?

312
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,731
Yes, madam.

313
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,233
Can I have Mr. Sawyer's charts?

314
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,178
We need to take blood and stool samples

315
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,448
for the lab.

316
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,318
Yes, madam.

317
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,877
I'll make some calls
and find out which lab.

318
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,178
I want strict diagnosing from now.

319
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,273
Full clinical PPE.

320
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:27,038
No unnecessary contact.

321
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,548
And visitors?

322
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,828
None, at all.

323
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,971
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:33,390
Ada, come with me.

325
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:44,308
You want to do the test now.

326
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:50,168
Okay.

327
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,368
And after you, where this go?

328
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,838
I spoke with Dr. Abdul Salam,

329
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,318
the Liberia state epidemiologist,

330
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,578
he said to send one to the
Liberia State University

331
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,390
hospital and one to Senator Daga.

332
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,084
We should get a preliminary statement

333
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:04,806
in 24 hours or so.

334
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,385
Good, very good.

335
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,518
I've got
the Liberian ambassador

336
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,629
to see you.

337
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:12,462
Of what now?

338
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:13,398
The Liberian ambassador again.

339
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,808
He says he has to see you straightaway.

340
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,641
Excuse me!

341
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,050
All right, please send him in.

342
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,010
Are you Ohiaeri?

343
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,027
And do you know who I am?

344
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:29,448
You were announced, yes.

345
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,718
But do you know who I am?

346
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,993
Dr. Adadevoh, would you excuse us?

347
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,202
Okay, I'll go.

348
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:44,537
If you need me, I'll be in
my office if you need me.

349
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:56,376
Now, where were we?

350
00:20:57,377 --> 00:21:00,164
I want to know exactly why

351
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,464
you are holding one of my nationals,

352
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,698
a man traveling on diplomatic papers

353
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,550
in your hospital?

354
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,763
Do you know I can cause
you lots of trouble?

355
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:33,382
Justina?

356
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,924
Justina.

357
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:38,520
Are you okay?

358
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:40,203
I'm fine.

359
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:41,122
I was just.

360
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,643
Did the sample go?

361
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,783
So, now what do we do?

362
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,813
We wait.

363
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,778
We look after our patients,

364
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,983
we do our jobs and we wait.

365
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,368
And him?

366
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,287
What about him?

367
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:10,073
We look after him, too.

368
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,858
Maybe you should ask
one of the other nurses

369
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,138
to look after Mr. Sawyer for now.

370
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,200
Just to be safe.

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,303
I already touched him.

372
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,413
I already.

373
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,783
He looked at me right
in the eyes and he lied.

374
00:22:39,924 --> 00:22:41,013
You will be fine.

375
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:43,881
Okay?

376
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:54,608
Adeniyi-Jones Africa desk.

377
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,878
This is Benjamin Ohiaeri

378
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,965
from First Consultants in Lagos.

379
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,969
What can I do for you Doctor?

380
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:04,971
Well, I think we have a
problem developing here.

381
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,098
What kind of a problem?

382
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,267
Talk to me.

383
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,848
Have you spoken to Federal yet?

384
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,785
I thought you might to do that,

385
00:23:20,787 --> 00:23:21,618
I can call them if you want?

386
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,278
Oh, no, no, no, no,

387
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,218
you were careful about
stepping on my toes,

388
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,318
I need to be careful about theirs.

389
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,798
Everything in Nigeria is
politics, you know that.

390
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,631
Even Ebola?

391
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,613
Even Ebola.

392
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:35,948
Well, the soonest we'll get any

393
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,738
kind of result is late tomorrow.

394
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,893
Maybe we can hold off going public,

395
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:43,368
but we need to meet.

396
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,868
We need a plan.

397
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,701
Agreed.

398
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:47,048
Will you move him?

399
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,850
No, no, no, I don't think so.

400
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:50,653
But if he's hot,

401
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:52,359
we're not equipped to handle than.

402
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:54,028
Who in Nigeria is?

403
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:56,958
And anyway, if he's hot, so are you.

404
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,178
First consultant is already contaminated.

405
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,139
Moving him around will
just spread the risk.

406
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:02,972
But.

407
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,758
Doctor, let's talk
this through tomorrow.

408
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,058
By then, I will have
brought Federal and State

409
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,263
up to speed, then we can
make informed choices.

This is what your father warned

426
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,864
us about 20 years ago.

427
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:31,381
You know that don't you?

428
00:25:31,383 --> 00:25:35,742
He said new viruses would
crawl out of the jungle

429
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,762
and find their way to Nigeria.

430
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:42,418
Ebola, Mabo, HIV, they
had made the jungle already.

431
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,858
But your father said we needed

432
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,002
to be ready for them here, Lagos, Nigeria.

433
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,501
Not the world, us.

434
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:52,248
I don't feel ready.

435
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,364
Do you think we caught in on time?

436
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,588
I think it would be good

437
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,106
if Mr. Sawyer was just a patient,

438
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:00,943
not the index patient.

439
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,491
If this is Ebola,

440
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,703
he's already symptomatic, infectious.

441
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:10,043
We've taken precautions.

442
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,333
I wish my father was wrong.

443
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:20,443
I just wish we'd listened better.

444
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,168
We simply cannot afford
an Ebola outbreak in Lagos.

445
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,498
Nigeria cannot afford it,

446
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,988
we cannot afford it.

447
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,498
The world cannot afford it.

448
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,845
Lagos is a city of over 21 million people

449
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:44,408
and an extensive outbreak in that city,

450
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,068
well, it's quite frankly
the doomsday scenario

451
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,928
that we've all feared.

452
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,518
Lagos is the hub of air
travel in West Africa

453
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,408
and Nigerians travel extensively.

454
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,538
There are literally dozens
of international flights

455
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,008
to and from major cities around the world

456
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,138
every single day.

457
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,128
Add to this the extensive
Nigerian diaspora

458
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,978
and the potential for a quick spread

459
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,525
across the world becomes
even more frightening

460
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:13,818
and believe me, it will be quick,

461
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,282
in a matter of days.

462
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:19,358
By the time the CDC, the
World Health Organization,

463
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,988
the Red Cross and MSF can start to get

464
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,148
a handle on the outbreak
of this potential scale,

465
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,778
millions will have been infected.

466
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,828
Before just a pandemic burns out,

467
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,798
we're projecting millions of deaths

468
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,688
across the world.

469
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,138
Millions.

470
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,429
We must treat this as
very serious and urgent.

471
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:42,112
CDC needs to get on this right away

472
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:46,128
and we need to prevail on WHO

473
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,200
to act quickly.

474
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,294
Mumsie, good morning.

475
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:10,068
Good morning Bakole.

476
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,608
Isn't it a bit early even for you.

477
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,553
This, from my never
awake before breakfast son.

478
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:21,073
Mumsie, is it true?

479
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,703
Is it Ebola?

480
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,588
We don't know yet.

481
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,198
That's not what Rita says.

482
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,612
People are already talking about it.

483
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:36,238
And they're saying it's
at First Consultants.

484
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,448
My friends have been
messaging me all night.

485
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,878
They must know something that I don't

486
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,340
because we have no results yet.

487
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:44,228
We're meeting later to look at

488
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,613
what we'll do if it is.

489
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,810
I told Wendy this would happen.

490
00:29:20,006 --> 00:29:24,593
I know everyone here is worried.

491
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,673
And so am I.

492
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:32,383
But we should get the
provisional results back

493
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:35,183
on Mr. Sawyer and I've been talking

494
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:37,706
with the World Health Organization

495
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,298
and the U.S. State Department.

496
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,967
They're sharing the very
best medical information

497
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:46,502
available with us.

498
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:50,404
We are not alone in this.

499
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:53,733
My husband said I
shouldn't come to work today.

500
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,417
My son didn't say that

501
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,088
and neither did my husband,

502
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,913
but they wanted.

503
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:05,073
Justina, I'm glad you came anyway.

504
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,448
I'm glad you all came.

505
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,440
And now we're here.

506
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:13,998
And we must do the job in front of us,

507
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,528
just like we do every day,

508
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,018
with every patient

509
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,048
that walks through our doors.

510
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,850
This is what we train for, people.

511
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,918
We can do this.

512
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,898
We can and we must.

513
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,478
Lagos is watching.

514
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,335
Nigeria is watching.

515
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:32,173
The world is watching.

516
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:37,548
These are documents from
World Health Organization

517
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,918
to make a useful guide.

518
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,923
So let's study it.

519
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,710
It will be very useful.

520
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,425
Come.

521
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:39,037
So, now we know.

522
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,213
Get this off from on me.

523
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,514
Get it off.

524
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:49,428
Mr. Sawyer.

525
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,248
I'm getting out of here.

526
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,948
Mr. Sawyer, you have to stop this.

527
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,278
I'm getting out of here.

528
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,658
Calm down.

529
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,671
Stop, don't!

530
00:31:56,673 --> 00:31:59,295
Just please.

531
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:00,128
What?

532
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,130
Calm down.

533
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:02,697
I don't need to calm down.

534
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,968
Stop!

535
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,556
Just stop, don't tell me to calm down.

536
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:10,868
Listen to me and let me go!

537
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,308
Why?

538
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,218
Why?

539
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,068
Let me go, just listen to me.

540
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,550
Mr. Sawyer.

541
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:18,343
Control yourself.

542
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,931
What do you think you're doing?

543
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,653
I have to get out.

544
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:23,933
And where would you go?

545
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:25,018
I have a meeting.

546
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,420
No, Mr. Sawyer, you don't.

547
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,293
You have Ebola.

548
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,818
Look, I know this is not
ideal, but then what is?

549
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,598
Lagos is simply not ready.

550
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,908
And why not?

551
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,078
What's the point of having an

552
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,550
infectious disease facility

553
00:32:53,552 --> 00:32:55,828
if it is not equipped to deal

554
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,390
with infectious diseases?

555
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,278
Do you really need me to explain

556
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,558
the complexities of politics, funding

557
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,208
and tough words to your doctor?

558
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,557
This is Nigeria.

559
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,878
Even simple things are complicated

560
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,968
and there's nothing
simple about any of this.

561
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,818
I'll tell you what's simple.

562
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,912
Ebola has been on our
doorstep for six months.

563
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:14,073
What are you saying,
what are you suggesting?

564
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,296
People, please.

565
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:16,928
Are we gonna crying over spilled milk

566
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,536
or we're gonna help clean it up?

567
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:21,888
Perhaps we could surprise people

568
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,011
by working together just this once.

569
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:26,933
If not now, then when?

570
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:30,176
Lagos State is on it.

571
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,958
Dr. Nasadi here will inform you

572
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,478
that our friends at
National are mobilizing.

573
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,098
We are all on it.

574
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,708
Perhaps we should have moved faster,

575
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,541
but we're moving now.

576
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:42,638
And Yaba, the people from
World Health Organization

577
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,748
are helping us figure how
best to use the facility.

578
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,638
Until then?

579
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,408
Until then, people in Nigeria

580
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,048
with the most experience

581
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,880
at handling an Ebola patient

582
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:56,078
are right here in this building.

583
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,513
Ladies and gentlemen.

584
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,119
At this time, I am able to confirm

585
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:06,103
the presence of a suspected
Ebola case in Lagos.

586
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:11,998
A Liberian American was admitted

587
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
into First Consultants
Medical Center on Ballot Day,

588
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,588
on Sunday, the 20th of July.

589
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,338
And we are working on
processing the results

590
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,180
of a series of tests.

591
00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:28,083
In the meantime, we
want to appeal for calm.

592
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:32,944
We assure you that
increased caution and checks

593
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:36,830
have been taken at all borders.

594
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:40,563
Do we have any questions?

595
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:43,378
The Minister of State

596
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,998
Minister of Health today confirmed

597
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,039
the first case of Ebola in Nigeria.

598
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:49,458
The first possible case
of Ebola virus in Nigeria

599
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,088
has been reported in Lagos.

600
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,528
A 40-year-old Liberian man

601
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,298
has been isolated after
he tested positive.

602
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,657
Just weeks ago, Nigeria
was a mere spectator

603
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:00,658
to the deadly Ebola crisis

604
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,688
sweeping West Africa,
but not there are fears

605
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:04,948
that country could be on the verge

606
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,398
of becoming the next
hot zone for the virus

607
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,318
with health officials there

608
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,638
warning every nation and every individual

609
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,028
is at risk.

610
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,108
At risk.

611
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,323
At risk.

612
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,998
Ebola is a killer.

613
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,278
It works very fast.

614
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,779
It can spread.

615
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:32,935
Oh, my God.

616
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:47,604
Dr. Adadevoh.

617
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,878
The traditional told us you're coming.

618
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,798
Yes, good morning.

619
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,830
I'm Dr. Wasiu Gbadamosi.

620
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:56,723
I'm in charge of the facility here, yes.

621
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,698
And that's Dr. David Brett-Major,

622
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,108
from the World Health Organization.

623
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,941
Pleased to meet you.

624
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:03,778
Same here.

625
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,408
That's Kamal, my clinical technician.

626
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,648
Kamal, is he also American?

627
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,328
No, he's Egyptian.

628
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,470
My infectious diseases bring interesting

629
00:37:12,472 --> 00:37:14,769
people together in interesting places.

630
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:16,891
You've done this before?

631
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:18,638
Yeah, a few times.

632
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,208
Ebola and I are old friends.

633
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,091
You have dangerous friends, Doctor.

634
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,073
Shall we see the facility then?

635
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,838
Such as it is.

636
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,228
Such as it is, yes.

637
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,257
This way please.

638
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:36,808
So, David here, has a couple of ideas

639
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,653
about what we can do about this.

640
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:42,408
Listen, David, why don't you just talk

641
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,658
us through the things you would say.

642
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:02,450
Is this the best we can do?

643
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:06,708
There's also the drug-resistant TB unit.

644
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,478
We feel that that might be viable

645
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,106
with some modifications.

646
00:38:10,108 --> 00:38:13,985
Until then, this is all there is.

647
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:15,137
But we can clean it up.

648
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,423
How about water sanitation?

649
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:22,503
Well, they're all less
than ideal, but workable.

650
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:44,337
Dr. Ameyo.

651
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:47,358
Dr. Ibeawuchi, how are you?

652
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,168
How's our guest?

653
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,578
He has been having difficulty

654
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,418
drinking his ORIS.

655
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,148
Then we must hang another bag.

656
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,947
I know, but we have to.

657
00:38:58,154 --> 00:39:00,858
I'll take care of it madam.

658
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,372
I'll come with you.

659
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:07,374
I need to speak with Mr. Sawyer anyway.

660
00:39:18,497 --> 00:39:19,580
Mr. Sawyer.

661
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:31,006
Tamike.

662
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:37,324
Hang on.

663
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,917
Good morning Mr. Sawyer.

664
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,510
Mr. Sawyer.

665
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:25,854
Dr. Ada.

666
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:36,038
Reports
reaching our newsroom

667
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,878
indicate that Nigerian
soldiers today clashed

668
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,618
with some members of a radical
Islamic group in Syria,

669
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,488
exchanging gunfire for over an hour.

670
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,338
When we return, a look at the central

671
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,453
bank of Nigeria economic report for July.

672
00:42:17,948 --> 00:42:21,204
Ah, Dr. Etris, there you are.

673
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:24,640
My Liberian friends are insisting

674
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,758
they receive copies of
the death certificate

675
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,368
and the Ebola test results.

676
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,899
And that we await their
government's decision

677
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:36,588
before we release the body.

678
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,848
The protocols are clear on this.

679
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,448
We can't wait.

680
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,337
We must cremate and we must do it now.

681
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:50,758
On my authority.

682
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,974
Exactly.

683
00:42:51,976 --> 00:42:53,553
Let me get my people on this.

684
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:05,412
Ah.

685
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:08,743
Is that the list.

686
00:43:08,745 --> 00:43:09,603
Yes, Uncle.

687
00:43:10,586 --> 00:43:13,608
A lot of our people had primary contact.

688
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,718
You included?

689
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,648
Not me.

690
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,293
I never actually touched the man.

691
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:20,109
Ah, but you have to be on the list.

692
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:21,406
We all are.

693
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:24,952
Fadak Bedajaro, Ada,
Bill, Cheme, Ms. Seferling.

694
00:43:24,954 --> 00:43:27,518
Some of the nurses on junior staff

695
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,029
and the new girl, Justina.

696
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:31,088
Ah.

697
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,513
She picked a bad day to start work.

698
00:43:35,627 --> 00:43:38,573
It's not your fault Ameyo, is it?

699
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,640
You didn't bring the plague here.

700
00:43:44,461 --> 00:43:46,119
These are our people.

701
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:47,038
Our family.

702
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,038
You all need to take your temperature

703
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,688
twice a day.

704
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,978
Headaches and fever
are the first symptoms.

705
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,885
Now, if your temperature spikes

706
00:44:10,887 --> 00:44:14,088
anything above 30 degrees Celsius,

707
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,538
you need to tell us right away.

708
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,378
The incubation period for Ebola

709
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,427
is between two and 21 days.

710
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:21,868
We will need to maintain this protocol

711
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,523
for the full 21 days.

712
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,443
We cannot afford to
take anything for granted.

713
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:31,397
We cannot afford to taking any risks.

714
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:35,022
If you feel sick, or
you have any concerns,

715
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:38,520
please, please, please, call immediately.

716
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:41,925
You have all done your
best for Mr. Sawyer,

717
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:44,608
but now is the time to see to the living.

718
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,443
Questions?

719
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,158
What about our patients?

720
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,179
They are being accommodated
at other facilities

721
00:44:52,181 --> 00:44:55,093
and monitored when necessary.

722
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,936
And while there's a risk
of transmission, it's low.

723
00:45:00,938 --> 00:45:03,656
But obviously, we need to be careful.

724
00:45:03,658 --> 00:45:05,423
We need to be sure.

725
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,098
Everyone in this room is a professional

726
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:15,100
and we've all acted as professionals.

727
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,038
So now we must finish what we started.

728
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,478
We'll all monitor ourselves and we'll

729
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,658
take the appropriate
precautions, of course.

730
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,179
Until our friends at World Health

731
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:28,338
determine that our facility is safe,

732
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,858
our doors will remain closed.

733
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,367
Perhaps we could take this time

734
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:37,369
to do some reading, learn more.

735
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,158
Uncle, you can't wait to retire

736
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,879
to that chicken post, can you?

737
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,393
So what now?

738
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:48,243
We pray.

739
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,120
Heavenly Father, we thank
you for your blessings.

740
00:45:54,122 --> 00:45:55,378
Thank you Father.

741
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,660
We ask oh, Lord,
for our protective hand

742
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,753
so shelter the whole
First Consultants firm.

743
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,993
We are scared Lord, we are afraid.

744
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:13,847
We ask that you calm our
fears and bring us peace.

745
00:46:15,327 --> 00:46:20,327
Father, protect us from
this dreadful disease.

746
00:46:21,327 --> 00:46:26,327
And Heavenly Father,
tonight we also ask that

747
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,808
you welcome your child, Patrick Sawyer,

748
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,464
into your arms.

749
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:34,083
Give him the peace in death

750
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:37,491
that was missing in these last terrible

751
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:39,178
days of his life.

752
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,184
Amen.

753
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,044
Oh, I'm still at my parents.

754
00:46:54,046 --> 00:46:57,158
I can't wait until you
are finished and back.

755
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,563
I miss you, eh.

756
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,708
I miss you, too.

757
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,741
I wish I didn't have to be away so often.

758
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:06,141
It's fine, babe, my
mom is spoiling me silly.

759
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:07,763
You just hurry and come back home, okay.

760
00:47:07,765 --> 00:47:09,258
Sure thing.

761
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,499
What's your temperature today?

762
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:12,334
36.8.

763
00:47:13,925 --> 00:47:16,559
And what must it be gain?

764
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:20,168
It's not
what it must be, silly.

765
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,068
It's what it must not be.

766
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,200
And what must it not be?

767
00:47:24,202 --> 00:47:26,428
Well, 38 or more is a fever

768
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,718
and a fever is bad.

769
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,420
So we're good then?

770
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:31,687
Yes, we are.

771
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:33,916
I love you.

772
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,345
I love you, too, boo-boo.

773
00:47:36,347 --> 00:47:37,180
Bye.

774
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:50,460
Oh, the old man.

775
00:47:50,462 --> 00:47:53,716
That old man, anyway.

776
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:56,689
Daddy is a very old man.

777
00:47:56,691 --> 00:47:58,691
You're a very old man.

778
00:48:02,724 --> 00:48:05,783
Old man is small, but.

779
00:48:05,785 --> 00:48:08,844
I know right?

780
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:11,263
Oh, now come here.

781
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,201
Come, come.

782
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,738
I don't care how
professional we think we are,

783
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,125
you have no idea how sneaky this virus us.

784
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,748
The best bug hunters in the world

785
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,718
have all tried to find out where

786
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,878
this little bastard hides

787
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,068
and no one's even managed that.

788
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,608
Believe me, when an
outbreak starts to burn,

789
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,158
it's hard to stop.

790
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,858
But we identified
that man that's landed.

791
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,861
And he was clearly symptomatic.

792
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:56,608
Dr. Gbadamosi, the question is not if

793
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,441
we'll get patients,

794
00:48:57,443 --> 00:48:59,068
it's when we'll get them.

795
00:48:59,070 --> 00:48:59,901
But the real question is will be

796
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,940
ready to receive them when they get here?

797
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:17,546
Evelyn.

798
00:49:20,443 --> 00:49:21,779
Ohiaeri.

799
00:49:21,781 --> 00:49:24,698
Dr. Ohiaeri,
they are taking me to YABA.

800
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,508
I told them nothing was wrong with me.

801
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,295
I just needed to fast and purge.

802
00:49:28,297 --> 00:49:32,540
That was all I really needed to do.

803
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:33,848
When?

804
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,012
This morning.

805
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,585
My children, I left them all alone.

806
00:49:37,587 --> 00:49:39,368
I didn't even confirm.

807
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,610
Would you have someone
check on them please.

808
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:42,852
Yeah.

809
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,854
Thank you.

810
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:01,943
Hello?

811
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,073
It started.

812
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,697
Who, Uncle, who?

813
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:49,613
Okay, people.

814
00:50:51,405 --> 00:50:53,348
It is now for us to do the job

815
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,500
that we are here to do.

816
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,093
Let's get those addresses
and the teams rolling.

817
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,035
We can do this.

818
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,048
Dr. Igonoh, my name is David.

819
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,028
I'm sorry about the spacesuit.

820
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,248
My boss gets really uptight

821
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,918
if I don't wear the full
uniform in the office.

822
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,262
One of my bosses is also like that.

823
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:24,838
Okay, so we're gonna need to take

824
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,168
a little blood and the we'll have

825
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,608
to keep you here for a while.

826
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,648
I'm sorry.

827
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,618
We're still writing the
protocols, we're still learning.

828
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,453
As I.

829
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:34,548
Okay, I'll take your
blood and then we'll

830
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,361
figure out the next part together, okay?

831
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:41,363
Good.

832
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,608
We have a problem with the

833
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,428
drivers of the ambulances,
they're scared of Ebola

834
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,788
and refusing to work, I'll
have to call you back.

835
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:04,638
I'll call you back.

836
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,990
Oh, no, you can't call me back now.

837
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:07,654
Don't you understand.

838
00:53:07,656 --> 00:53:08,597
I understand.

839
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:09,908
I'm running a fever and I'm sitting

840
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,878
in my brother's house with his children

841
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,114
and you're telling me.

842
00:53:13,116 --> 00:53:14,355
Go away!

843
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,524
Go back, get away from me.

844
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:19,531
Uncle Morris has got a cough.

845
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,254
I don't want you to catch it.

846
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:23,658
Don't cry now, you
didn't do anything wrong.

847
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,813
Go back, eh, man.

848
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,418
Hello?

849
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,308
Are you still here?

850
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,428
Yes, yes.

851
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,288
Do you hear what I'm doing Matia.

852
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,158
So, sorry, sir.

853
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,098
The problem with the drivers

854
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,454
should be fixed soon and
they will come and get you.

855
00:53:40,456 --> 00:53:41,908
Okay, okay.

856
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,203
They'll come and get you.

857
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,268
I get you.

858
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,638
I understand.

859
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,291
But you are not listening.

860
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:53,908
Everybody's scared here.

861
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,268
People are scared,

862
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,258
but someone needs to talk to them

863
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,083
to convince them to go back to work.

864
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,278
You know what?

865
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,868
I'll call you back.

866
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,073
I'll call you back.

867
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,653
Problem?

868
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,308
Yeah.

869
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,143
Problem.

870
00:54:12,244 --> 00:54:13,598
Listen, you have to understand

871
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,722
the level of fear we're dealing with here.

872
00:54:15,724 --> 00:54:16,555
No, I don't have to understand anything.

873
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,598
I live with that fear every damn day.

874
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,138
The drivers are scared.

875
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,324
You think I'm not?

876
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:24,763
Kamal isn't every time we
put on those damn suits?

877
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,148
I have seen what it can do.

878
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,763
I know what it can do.

879
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,493
Here, look.

880
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,393
Look at this.

881
00:54:37,715 --> 00:54:40,013
Is this what you want?

882
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:41,798
Is this what you are allowing to happen

883
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,548
in this city?

884
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,973
There are upwards of
21 million people here.

885
00:54:46,975 --> 00:54:51,853
I know what Ebola can do, trust me.

886
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,438
And what I know terrifies me.

887
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,853
Nothing terrifies me more.

888
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:59,409
I wake up sweating.

889
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:01,728
And that is why I do what I do,

890
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,978
because the only way to
deal with this bastard

891
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,528
is to deal with it.

892
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,068
Not make excuses.

893
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,813
Excuses kill people.

894
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:12,411
Now you tell those
drivers, you tell everyone,

895
00:55:12,413 --> 00:55:14,928
that we either beat this here and now

896
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:15,880
or it will beat us.

897
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:17,953
Okay?

898
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:21,433
Now, if you'll excuse me.

899
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:24,088
I have to go and confirm with a beautiful

900
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,818
young lady that she has a disease

901
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:29,043
that kills eight out of
every 10 people it infects.

902
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,313
I'll do my job.

903
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,443
Please make sure your people do theirs.

904
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,403
Thank you.

905
00:55:55,657 --> 00:55:57,288
Baby.

906
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,608
Please, say it's a joke.

907
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,968
A bad joke.

908
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,038
It will be all right, God will.

909
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,138
We don't know for sure yet,

910
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,001
it might be nothing, it
might be something else.

911
00:56:07,003 --> 00:56:08,618
We just don't know.

912
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,233
Promise me, promise
me it'll be all right.

913
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:15,533
Ada, Ada.

914
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:20,448
Our nation needs us.

915
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,528
They need us.

916
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:25,933
Our children, our family, they
needs us to keep them safe.

917
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,077
I know you are scared.

918
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,613
I am scared also.

919
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:34,898
But standing here before you right now,

920
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,877
I have resolved not to
let fear make me weak.

921
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:43,879
My friends, tell me,
who will stand with me.

922
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:48,518
Who will stand with me
to keep our city safe,

923
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,618
to keep Nigeria safe.

924
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:55,620
We need people to go out
and take the sick to YABA

925
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,783
and the sooner we do this,

926
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,850
the better for all of us.

927
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,453
Who will go>

928
00:57:08,402 --> 00:57:09,235
Hmm?

929
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:12,752
Thank you.

930
00:57:12,754 --> 00:57:13,958
Thank you.

931
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,723
Thank you very much.

932
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:17,708
Thank you.

933
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,958
Here?

934
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,693
For now, yes.

935
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:14,508
We get better here?

936
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,253
We have to contain this.

937
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:18,829
Once a ward is ready, you'll be moved.

938
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:21,408
If I'm still alive.

939
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,243
You will be.

940
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:25,072
In here?

941
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:27,343
Listen to me.

942
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,428
You can beat this.

943
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,843
You, not me, you.

944
00:59:32,845 --> 00:59:35,298
I will support you in every possible way,

945
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,118
but you have to decide right now

946
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,385
if you're gonna fight

947
00:59:38,387 --> 00:59:39,853
or if you're gonna give up.

948
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,238
This place isn't perfect.

949
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,277
It's not even close.

950
00:59:46,279 --> 00:59:49,388
But what's inside this
ward is not important.

951
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,940
What's important is what's
inside you, you hear me?

952
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,168
Good.

953
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,003
Very good.

954
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,281
Now.

955
01:00:01,283 --> 01:00:04,993
Pick a bed and start fighting.

956
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,070
The sooner you star,
the sooner you'll win.

957
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:44,480
Hello, Doctor.

958
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,226
Madam Evelyn, you're here, too?

959
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,025
They say I'm sick.

960
01:00:56,670 --> 01:01:00,738
My pastor said I just
needed to fast and purge,

961
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,083
but they brought me here anyway.

962
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:05,253
Sweet Jesus.

963
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:08,713
I hope my children are all right.

964
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,288
Who'll cook for them, while I'm in here?

965
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,490
I'm sure they're fine.

966
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,053
Tell me, how are you feeling?

967
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:22,836
I'm hot and sore.

968
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,407
You're very hot.

969
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,523
Are you drinking an RIA addition solution?

970
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,323
I'm trying, it's hard.

971
01:01:40,048 --> 01:01:41,448
It is bad.

972
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,363
I know, but you must.

973
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,663
They told me to.

974
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,733
I tried.

975
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:55,370
Dr. Ada, it's not good to be here alone.

976
01:01:56,496 --> 01:01:58,873
I was very frightened.

977
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,748
You don't need to be frightened anymore.

978
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:03,983
I'm here now, okay.

979
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:45,653
Ameyo.

980
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,905
You should eat.

981
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:50,909
I will.

982
01:03:53,218 --> 01:03:54,051
Okay.

983
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:58,411
I'll be back to check.

984
01:04:00,092 --> 01:04:02,759
Afolabi, I'm eating the fruit.

985
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:50,286
Hello?

986
01:05:08,649 --> 01:05:09,899
Morris.

987
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:19,792
Hello, friend, welcome
to our little home.

988
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:43,106
Look at him, sitting
there eating, laughing.

989
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,490
He brought this into our lives.

990
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,273
He's wealthy.

991
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,183
The man only was doing his job.

992
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:00,913
Just like us.

993
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,479
Now he's sick, just like us.

994
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:06,314
I know.

995
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,283
This place is terrible.

996
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,520
You've been vomiting?

997
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,778
And diarrhea?

998
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,833
That too, a little.

999
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,068
I want you to start keeping a detailed

1000
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,828
account of those things, okay.

1001
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,508
I'm asking everyone.

1002
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,001
As long as the count's going up,

1003
01:07:35,003 --> 01:07:36,168
then we know the virus is winning.

1004
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:37,444
When it comes down,

1005
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:38,277
then we know that your immune system

1006
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:40,138
is starting to fight back.

1007
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,973
So how often does it come down?

1008
01:07:44,275 --> 01:07:48,508
In my experience, not often,

1009
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:52,218
but I'm learning here just as much as you.

1010
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,658
Up till now I've been fighting a bush war.

1011
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,168
This is all new to me.

1012
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,808
Most of you folks are young and healthy

1013
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,810
and that may be a game changer.

1014
01:08:00,812 --> 01:08:04,548
But surely you've treated
young people before.

1015
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:07,843
Yeah, lots.

1016
01:08:15,361 --> 01:08:18,733
There was this one young man, beautiful.

1017
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,728
One of the most people I ever saw.

1018
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,628
If it was Paris or New York,

1019
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:26,128
he'd be on the cover of every magazine

1020
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:29,930
in the world, but well, he was just

1021
01:08:29,932 --> 01:08:32,123
some dirt poor farmer from the deep bush.

1022
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:36,948
His wife got sick and his kids got sick,

1023
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,796
then he got sick.

1024
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:41,174
This how it works, this little bastard.

1025
01:08:41,176 --> 01:08:45,150
It jumps when you care for
the ones that you love.

1026
01:08:45,152 --> 01:08:48,273
It jumps when you bury your damn dead.

1027
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:51,793
Anyway, this man, this beautiful man.

1028
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:55,988
He was young, tough as nails.

1029
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:58,443
He fought, he fought hard.

1030
01:09:02,032 --> 01:09:04,168
He watched his wife die,

1031
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:07,688
he outlived his children and still

1032
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:08,690
he wouldn't give up.

1033
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:15,068
But he was poor, you
know, under nourished.

1034
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:17,424
So far below the poverty line, they need

1035
01:09:17,426 --> 01:09:19,663
a new word to describe it.

1036
01:09:22,327 --> 01:09:24,103
And it got him in the end.

1037
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,593
He crashed, he bled out.

1038
01:09:30,463 --> 01:09:34,013
And we burned him.

1039
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:37,786
And he wasn't beautiful anymore.

1040
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,193
Ebola.

1041
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:48,033
Ebola made his less
before it destroyed him.

1042
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,363
You never saw a more beautiful man.

1043
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,173
I'm so sorry.

1044
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,918
It's okay, really it is.

1045
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,903
No, no, it's no, I'm so sorry.

1046
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,328
You're scared.

1047
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,943
Yet you come in here anyway.

1048
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,448
Evelyn says you're a hero.

1049
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,513
I'm no hero.

1050
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,388
I'm just some Kentucky boy,

1051
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,816
who took a wrong turn, ended up studying,

1052
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:24,961
ended studying virology instead of,

1053
01:10:24,963 --> 01:10:28,140
I don't know, radiology seemed much safer.

1054
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:31,878
I always said you know what
you are with radiation.

1055
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:42,660
Dr. Igonoah, this bug,
this damn bug, it's dumb

1056
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,137
and it's a bully,

1057
01:10:46,139 --> 01:10:49,098
but it's not as tough as
it likes people to think.

1058
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,498
Sure it comes in hard,

1059
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,528
it hits your immune system
with everything it has.

1060
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:56,548
And like any good bully,
can throw a punch.

1061
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,469
But it can't take one.

1062
01:10:58,471 --> 01:11:00,708
If you give your body long enough,

1063
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:01,813
you will beat this.

1064
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:05,944
I'll try.

1065
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,634
You keep that count, okay.

1066
01:11:12,636 --> 01:11:14,748
That way you'll know when you get

1067
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,033
that bully on the run.

1068
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,510
I'll get it.

1069
01:11:21,512 --> 01:11:22,345
It's okay, I got it.

1070
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,459
All right, I got you, okay.

1071
01:11:28,461 --> 01:11:29,461
Dr. David?

1072
01:11:34,048 --> 01:11:34,881
Thank you.

1073
01:13:17,468 --> 01:13:22,468
Stay with me, please.

1074
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:28,703
Please, someone, please help.

1075
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:30,241
Get her out of my car.

1076
01:13:30,243 --> 01:13:32,320
Please get her out of my car.

1077
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:35,198
Please, please, please, please.

1078
01:13:45,618 --> 01:13:46,659
Dr. David!

1079
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:48,541
Dr. David, Dr. David!

1080
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,460
Come quick.

1081
01:13:52,752 --> 01:13:54,292
Get that girl out of my car.

1082
01:13:54,294 --> 01:13:56,198
Please get her out of the back.

1083
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,470
Sir, please, listen to me.

1084
01:13:57,472 --> 01:13:58,690
Please.

1085
01:13:58,692 --> 01:13:59,578
You have to listen to me.

1086
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,158
Okay.

1087
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,788
We're gonna help you, but
you have to listen to me.

1088
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:04,067
You have to listen.

1089
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:04,900
Get her out of my car.

1090
01:14:04,902 --> 01:14:06,729
Sir, please, please.

1091
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:08,249
I told you I don't want.

1092
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:09,082
Please, you need to
be quiet, sir, please.

1093
01:14:09,084 --> 01:14:11,583
Shh, we'll talk.

1094
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,210
Stay back, stay back, sir, please.

1095
01:14:18,212 --> 01:14:20,338
We're gonna help you, okay,

1096
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,793
but we have to do this
right, you understand me.

1097
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:22,626
Okay.

1098
01:14:22,628 --> 01:14:24,217
Okay, you see Kamal there?

1099
01:14:24,219 --> 01:14:25,898
Kamal is gonna lead the way

1100
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:29,658
and then we're gonna slowly,
carefully to the ward.

1101
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:30,628
You understand me?

1102
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:33,008
Okay, you need to stay here.

1103
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:33,918
You cannot leave.

1104
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,032
This is the Ebola facility,
do you understand.

1105
01:14:37,867 --> 01:14:38,698
You will stay right here.

1106
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:39,531
You will sit right here.

1107
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:41,773
Dr. Gbadamosi will take care of you.

1108
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,233
Good morning.

1109
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,023
How are you feeling?

1110
01:15:18,336 --> 01:15:19,169
Weak.

1111
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,538
It's to be expected.

1112
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,800
Drink your ORIS.

1113
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,302
I can't.

1114
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:43,603
It's horrible.

1115
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,008
I know.

1116
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:48,148
But you must.

1117
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:49,130
We all must.

1118
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:58,243
Okay.

1119
01:15:58,245 --> 01:15:59,078
Soon.

1120
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:09,314
I'm sorry about your baby.

1121
01:16:46,863 --> 01:16:49,161
These conditions
shouldn't be secluded

1122
01:16:49,163 --> 01:16:51,316
to Nigerians, about the cure
for the disease is false

1123
01:16:51,318 --> 01:16:54,562
and should not be taken seriously.

1124
01:16:54,564 --> 01:16:57,044
False does not cure Ebola.

1125
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:57,879
Bankie.

1126
01:16:59,893 --> 01:17:00,955
Come.

1127
01:17:00,957 --> 01:17:01,790
Come.

1128
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:03,764
Sit down.

1129
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:12,531
You okay?

1130
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:16,966
It's my mom.

1131
01:17:19,164 --> 01:17:20,331
Is she okay?

1132
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:23,123
Tell me.

1133
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,303
She's been worried about everybody else,

1134
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,110
but she's not taking care of herself.

1135
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:39,994
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep.

1136
01:17:39,996 --> 01:17:41,613
She stays up late.

1137
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:46,933
We've tried talking to her, but.

1138
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:57,348
Ma, your body needs the fluids

1139
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,983
to fight the virus.

1140
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:05,213
I try, doctor, I do.

1141
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:09,322
What?

1142
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:14,933
When I'm a go, doctor, you'll take care

1143
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:20,368
of my children, won't you?

1144
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,273
You will look at them yourself.

1145
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:31,813
People will know it's lost this day.

1146
01:18:34,671 --> 01:18:36,171
They will fear it.

1147
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,191
Ma, don't even talk like that.

1148
01:18:44,132 --> 01:18:49,132
Promise you will talk to Dr. Ohiaeri.

1149
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:53,329
Promise me.

1150
01:19:28,095 --> 02:38:57,878
Oh, my.

1151
01:20:26,974 --> 01:20:29,891
How long are they her body there,

1152
01:20:30,863 --> 01:20:32,196
lying like that?

1153
01:20:35,733 --> 01:20:39,143
They have to be very
careful, even there.

1154
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:42,507
The body is very dangerous.

1155
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,023
Still.

1156
01:21:26,197 --> 01:21:27,838
Uncle.

1157
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,757
You called.

1158
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:33,453
Abaniwa is gone.

1159
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:37,623
Died of a stroke.

1160
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,198
A stroke.

1161
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,033
Good God.

1162
01:21:42,737 --> 01:21:44,303
What about his wife?

1163
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,990
With her family.

1164
01:21:48,965 --> 01:21:50,579
They're making the arrangements.

1165
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:54,921
Obviously, we'll help her
with anything she needs.

1166
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:58,495
Of course, I'll go and visit her,

1167
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,747
take some food.

1168
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:04,137
Stroke or no stroke,

1169
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:06,688
it's these damn people that did this.

1170
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,617
They did all of this.

1171
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:10,773
Maybe not directly, but still.

1172
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:17,683
I.

1173
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,558
I called, YABA,

1174
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,318
sent them some dietary advice for Justina,

1175
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,088
to help with her immune system.

1176
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:32,907
Good, we must tend to the living,

1177
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:39,193
which is why I have
asked you to come see me.

1178
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,163
What do you need?

1179
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,213
I need you to take the test.

1180
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:53,366
Not you as well?

1181
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:55,867
Did Afolabi tell you to do this?

1182
01:22:55,869 --> 01:22:57,148
Yeah, and Bankie spoke with me.

1183
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,508
These two are just as bad as each other.

1184
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,828
Don't they realize how much I have to do,

1185
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:02,308
how busy I am.

1186
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,408
They're both worried about you.

1187
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:06,448
You're tired, not sleeping.

1188
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:08,428
I've told them what I've told you.

1189
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:09,858
I'm stressed, we all are.

1190
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:13,523
I'm sorry if I look as bad as I feel.

1191
01:23:15,634 --> 01:23:19,138
There's the famous Dr. Adadevoh

1192
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,238
bedside manner the staff and everyone

1193
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,473
tells me so much about.

1194
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:28,518
Uncle, I don't need the test.

1195
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,113
I don't.

1196
01:23:31,454 --> 01:23:36,454
Do you remember what
your father said to me

1197
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:41,554
when he said that you and
I should work together.

1198
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:45,053
He said I was brilliant and painful.

1199
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,448
Would you ever stop telling that story?

1200
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:51,022
Not as long as I live.

1201
01:23:51,024 --> 01:23:53,773
It's the greatest compliment
I ever experienced.

1202
01:23:55,843 --> 01:23:58,362
It brought the two of us together.

1203
01:23:58,364 --> 01:24:00,533
You're always my child, Imoka.

1204
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:04,973
Charlie and Bo.

1205
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:08,743
Almost as good as brilliance.

1206
01:24:10,677 --> 01:24:15,048
Aadevoh, the brilliant doctor

1207
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:19,275
who says she's too busy
saving everyone else.

1208
01:24:19,277 --> 01:24:23,238
He said she never touched
the indexed patients

1209
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,854
and sees no reason for tests.

1210
01:24:26,856 --> 01:24:31,530
The good doctor who says
just take it anyway,

1211
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:40,460
if only to put the minds who
love you the most at ease

1212
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:44,970
and make an old man happy

1213
01:24:46,636 --> 01:24:48,907
on a very sad day.

1214
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,863
Fine.

1215
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:55,068
If I will stop the men in my life

1216
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,728
from ganging up against
me, I'll take the tests.

1217
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,758
Now can we talk about what else we can do

1218
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,140
to help our people at YABA?

1219
01:25:16,266 --> 01:25:17,099
Jatu.

1220
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:21,530
Are you taking your medicine?

1221
01:25:27,243 --> 01:25:29,100
That's no good.

1222
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:37,343
You have this deadly
thing on the inside of us

1223
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:39,813
and you're worried about the common cough.

1224
01:26:01,348 --> 01:26:03,798
It will be me next.

1225
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,250
Don't talk like that.

1226
01:26:09,794 --> 01:26:10,877
It will be.

1227
01:26:12,654 --> 01:26:13,487
I know it.

1228
01:26:23,903 --> 01:26:25,403
Drink your ORIS.

1229
01:26:27,326 --> 01:26:28,159
You must.

1230
01:27:28,773 --> 01:27:29,606
Jatu.

1231
01:27:32,272 --> 01:27:33,445
You've been quiet since.

1232
01:27:33,447 --> 01:27:34,597
I'm all right.

1233
01:27:39,628 --> 01:27:40,461
Jatu.

1234
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:45,706
Oh, my God.

1235
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:52,253

God please keep them.

1266
01:33:40,357 --> 01:33:41,190
Mumsie.

1267
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,133
Mumsie.

1268
01:34:01,731 --> 01:34:03,648
The ambulance is here.

1269
01:34:07,187 --> 01:34:08,187
You need need to go.

1270
01:34:20,493 --> 01:34:21,326
I'm sorry.

1271
01:34:44,711 --> 01:34:46,044
Just leave me.

1272
01:35:12,990 --> 01:35:15,139
Thanks for sticking with us folks.

1273
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:16,518
Remember, from now on,

1274
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,488
we don't live or die on our own.

1275
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:20,298
We're not just responsible
for our patients,

1276
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:22,419
we are responsible for ourselves.

1277
01:35:22,421 --> 01:35:24,848
What do we say about quick hands?

1278
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:26,158
Quick hand will kill you.

1279
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,133
Exactly right.

1280
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:30,548
Everything we do, we do slow and careful,

1281
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:31,750
just like we've trained.

1282
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:34,448
This is not medical school folks.

1283
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:36,008
No one passes the Ebola exam

1284
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:38,083
with anything less than perfect marks.

1285
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,508
You see and I tell you,

1286
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:46,160
infectious medicines is the
only game worth playing.

1287
01:35:46,162 --> 01:35:48,988
I wanted to be a cardiologist.

1288
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:50,894
Well, no one's perfect.

1289
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,568
Okay, thanks.

1290
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,403
Be right back.

1291
01:36:27,634 --> 01:36:28,717
Dr. Adadevoh.

1292
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,473
Dr. David.

1293
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:39,046
You look different than
the last time I saw you.

1294
01:36:39,048 --> 01:36:39,913
Yes.

1295
01:36:40,989 --> 01:36:42,433
But this place has also changed.

1296
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:46,508
Are my people still
in that horrible ward?

1297
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:47,598
We're about ready to start

1298
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,358
moving them across in the proper facility.

1299
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,613
It's about damn time.

1300
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:53,328
Yeah, we just have
a few more things to do,

1301
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,947
then we can move them.

1302
01:36:54,949 --> 01:36:56,361
Thank you doctor.

1303
01:36:56,363 --> 01:36:59,538
Now can we do this test so people

1304
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,864
can stop wasting their
time worrying about me?

1305
01:37:01,866 --> 01:37:04,809
Yeah, we need to take your blood.

1306
01:37:04,811 --> 01:37:08,088
But in the meantime, I'm gonna ask my team

1307
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,981
to set aside a private room for you.

1308
01:37:09,983 --> 01:37:11,057
What?

1309
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:13,288
What are you talking about?

1310
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:14,938
I'm only here for the test.

1311
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:17,556
Yes, yeah, we have to test your blood

1312
01:37:17,558 --> 01:37:21,878
and then it's my
recommendation as your doctor

1313
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,948
that you stay in our care until we

1314
01:37:23,950 --> 01:37:25,298
get the results.

1315
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:26,750
What are you talking about?

1316
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:31,558
I know what I know

1317
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,138
and I know what I see with my own eyes

1318
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,290
and I've seen it a
hundred different times.

1319
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,749
You need to stay in this facility until

1320
01:37:38,751 --> 01:37:41,226
we get the results.

1321
01:37:41,228 --> 01:37:43,304
You shouldn't go home.

1322
01:37:43,306 --> 01:37:47,108
Not in your, not in your condition.

1323
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:50,508
What are you talking about?

1324
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:51,693
What condition?

1325
01:37:52,864 --> 01:37:54,513
I didn't touch him.

1326
01:37:55,424 --> 01:37:57,938
Perhaps you've read
about the aerosol effect.

1327
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:58,821
Of course I've read about it.

1328
01:37:58,823 --> 01:38:00,308
I read everything, I did the research.

1329
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:01,143
I've.

1330
01:38:04,959 --> 01:38:07,126
I only changed his IV bag.

1331
01:38:09,993 --> 01:38:10,826
That night.

1332
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,193
The last night before he died.

1333
01:38:16,218 --> 01:38:17,973
Probably, yes.

1334
01:38:19,818 --> 01:38:20,651
Yes.

1335
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:22,533
Yes.

1336
01:38:26,601 --> 01:38:27,684
I see it now.

1337
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:35,211
It's.

1338
01:38:35,213 --> 01:38:37,883
It's my son's birthday tomorrow.

1339
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:41,688
Well, the sooner we
get you to your room,

1340
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,716
the sooner we can get you home.

1341
01:38:43,718 --> 01:38:45,018
Yes.

1342
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:45,851
Come.

1343
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:46,686
Yes.

1344
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,280
They brought her in earlier today.

1345
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,278
And she's already symptomatic.

1346
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,113
Mm-hmm.

1347
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:30,688
She was so worried about everyone else.

1348
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:31,933
Of course she was.

1349
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:36,718
She's the best boss I've ever had.

1350
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:37,993
And you still have her.

1351
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:41,428
Now, tell me about you.

1352
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,928
How are you feeling?

1353
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:44,248
About the same.

1354
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,083
Can I see?

1355
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:56,478
Is this true?

1356
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,703
The same count as yesterday.

1357
01:39:58,705 --> 01:40:01,318
So far, yes.

1358
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,670
Well, that's good news,
good news, very good.

1359
01:40:08,483 --> 01:40:09,483
Oh, madam.

1360
01:40:11,906 --> 01:40:12,989
Dr. Adadevoh.

1361
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:17,520
She's also like a mother to me.

1362
01:40:17,522 --> 01:40:20,189
We're doing everything we can.

1363
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:25,353
Happy birthday Bankie.

1364
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:33,468
Thanks Mumsie.

1365
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:36,627
Did you like presents I bought you?

1366
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:39,813
Yes, yes, I did.

1367
01:40:43,778 --> 01:40:45,278
And your father?

1368
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:49,328
Yeah, we prayed this morning together

1369
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:50,623
before he went to work.

1370
01:40:51,613 --> 01:40:52,696
Good, good.

1371
01:40:53,753 --> 01:40:55,586
Did he get you a cake?

1372
01:40:57,036 --> 01:40:59,311
Mumsie, I don't think birthday cake

1373
01:40:59,313 --> 01:41:04,313
will be necessary now.

1374
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:08,042
Bankie, it's your birthday.

1375
01:41:08,044 --> 01:41:10,571
You must have a cake.

1376
01:41:10,573 --> 01:41:13,700
All right Mumsie,
Mumsie, we will, we will.

1377
01:41:18,101 --> 01:41:22,462
I got the stuff you asked for.

1378
01:41:22,464 --> 01:41:27,363
I left them at your door.

1379
01:41:27,365 --> 01:41:28,871
Thank you.

1380
01:41:28,873 --> 01:41:30,403
I'll get them soon.

1381
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:37,560
Would you be needing anything else?

1382
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:40,060
No, thank you.

1383
01:41:41,524 --> 01:41:46,524
Just, I love you so much Bankie.

1384
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,720
I love you, too, Mumsie.

1385
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:07,847
I love you, too, Mumsie.

1386
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:17,940
Morris.

1387
01:42:17,942 --> 01:42:18,775
Hmm.

1388
01:42:20,758 --> 01:42:21,908
Morris.

1389
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:22,743
See.

1390
01:42:24,065 --> 01:42:24,896
Look.

1391
01:42:24,898 --> 01:42:25,848
It's coming down.

1392
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:26,683
See.

1393
01:42:31,826 --> 01:42:33,326
Mm, that's good.

1394
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:36,958
That's very good.

1395
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,423
How about you?

1396
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,289
Mm.

1397
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:49,958
Well, give it time.

1398
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:53,293
See, this Ebola, it's gonna be beaten.

1399
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:55,653
Give it time brother.

1400
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,300
Dr. Ohaieri tells me you called him.

1401
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:13,733
He promised me he would
look after all of them.

1402
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:16,193
We told him that.

1403
01:43:17,338 --> 01:43:19,193
You done just fine.

1404
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:22,536
Your people are getting
the best care they can.

1405
01:43:22,538 --> 01:43:23,633
I found it not.

1406
01:43:24,637 --> 01:43:25,483
Not for Evelyn, not for Justina,

1407
01:43:27,818 --> 01:43:29,353
and her unborn baby.

1408
01:43:30,298 --> 01:43:31,963
The small children.

1409
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,016
No, not for them.

1410
01:43:36,018 --> 01:43:39,303
But for some of the other
perhaps, I'm hopeful.

1411
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:43,763
And you, God, you a
fighter, I can see that.

1412
01:43:44,637 --> 01:43:46,518
And you can fight this.

1413
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,643
You can still win.

1414
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,248
It hasn't beaten you yet.

1415
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,473
Well, not yet.

1416
01:43:57,053 --> 01:43:58,380
We stopped it, didn't we.

1417
01:44:01,209 --> 01:44:02,713
I stopped at the head.

1418
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:06,629
Yep, I think you did.

1419
01:44:06,631 --> 01:44:08,487
That's good.

1420
01:44:08,489 --> 01:44:10,572
Good for us, good for us.

1421
01:44:13,634 --> 01:44:15,843
It's good for everyone.

1422
01:44:20,093 --> 01:44:23,343
We didn't know it, but we stopped it.

1423
01:44:24,610 --> 01:44:25,610
We did that.

1424
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:35,518
Joining us now on News at 10,

1425
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,628
to discuss the status
of Ebola here in Nigeria

1426
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:39,318
is the Deputy Incidence Manager

1427
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,958
of the Ebola Emergency
Center here in Lagos,

1428
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,828
Dr. Olukayode Oguntimehin.

1429
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:44,968
Dr. Oguntimehin, thank you for joining us

1430
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:46,088
on the News at 10.

1431
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:46,921
Thanks for having me.

1432
01:44:46,923 --> 01:44:47,948
Well, lots of people are already scared

1433
01:44:47,950 --> 01:44:49,418
that Ebola is in Nigeria,

1434
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:51,643
so tell us exactly what the status is.

1435
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:57,078
Well, so far we have
had 12 confirmed cases

1436
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,678
that stem from Mr. Patrick Sawyer.

1437
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,818
But we are happy to announce

1438
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:05,978
that cases of new
infections are fast falling

1439
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:08,445
and that is a good thing.

1440
01:45:08,447 --> 01:45:09,488
And why is that?

1441
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:10,998
Is that because of the efforts

1442
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,688
by the EOC?

1443
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:13,748
Well, yes.

1444
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:17,808
To date, we have had 894 contacts

1445
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,098
identified and monitored.

1446
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:24,907
But about 18,500 face-to-face visits

1447
01:45:24,909 --> 01:45:28,488
were contacted by contact choices

1448
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:33,488
in order to able to assess
Ebola symptom development.

1449
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:35,878
We have also deployed a massive

1450
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,788
social mobilization campaign,

1451
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:39,818
with new infections nearing zero.

1452
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:42,718
And patients in isolation
are getting better.

1453
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:46,458
With this we are confident
that our containment

1454
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:48,313
and treatment program is working.

1455
01:46:12,416 --> 01:46:14,428
It was touch and go for a while.

1456
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,638
I thought she might be winning,

1457
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:18,792
but it sometimes works that way.

1458
01:46:18,794 --> 01:46:21,790
She slipped into a coma last night.

1459
01:46:21,792 --> 01:46:23,938
Even if she does come back now,

1460
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:26,090
she probably doesn't
come all the way back.

1461
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,213
I'll pray for her.

1462
01:46:32,053 --> 01:46:34,472
Yeah, that'll be good.

1463
01:46:34,474 --> 01:46:36,178
You know I think your prayers

1464
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:37,910
might just be working.

1465
01:46:37,912 --> 01:46:40,793
Why, the blood work, my count?

1466
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:46,043
I told you you could
do this, I told you.

1467
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,093
And her?

1468
01:47:11,378 --> 01:47:14,334
Remember how you said there is nothing

1469
01:47:14,336 --> 01:47:16,086
that we forgot to do.

1470
01:47:17,975 --> 01:47:21,123
Madam, the whole
country's praying for you.

1471
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:32,003
The Lord is my shepherd.

1472
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:34,153
I shall not want.

1473
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:38,098
He makes me to lie down in green pastures.

1474
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:40,103
He leads me behind still waters.

1475
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:43,043
He restores my soul.

1476
01:47:44,151 --> 01:47:46,933
He leads me in the path of righteousness,

1477
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,730
for his namesake.

1478
01:47:50,857 --> 01:47:54,073
Yeah, though I walk in the valley

1479
01:47:54,075 --> 01:47:57,045
of the shadow of death,

1480
01:47:57,047 --> 01:47:59,019
I will fear no evil.

1481
01:47:59,021 --> 01:48:04,021
For you are with me, you
are holding your staff.

1482
01:48:53,554 --> 01:48:54,385
You know your mother wouldn't

1483
01:48:54,387 --> 01:48:55,848
want you to remember her like this.

1484
01:48:55,850 --> 01:48:59,483
She wouldn't want you
to remember this place.

1485
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,567
How could I not?

1486
01:49:06,553 --> 01:49:07,503
How could I forget?

1487
01:49:09,971 --> 01:49:11,171
How could I forget this?

1488
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:12,921
This?

1489
01:49:12,923 --> 01:49:15,297
No, this could have been far, far worse.

1490
01:49:15,299 --> 01:49:16,132
How?

1491
01:49:18,459 --> 01:49:20,178
Well, this place could
be drowning right now,

1492
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:21,825
buried beneath a mountain of the sick

1493
01:49:21,827 --> 01:49:24,658
and the dying if it hadn't been

1494
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:25,910
for what your mother did.

1495
01:49:27,220 --> 01:49:29,888
She's a very, very good doctor.

1496
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:31,003
She's a better mom.

1497
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:37,310
Then that's what you
should remember, not this.

1498
01:51:03,027 --> 01:51:04,777
Look, look at this.

1499
01:51:12,219 --> 01:51:13,136
Come, look.

1500
01:51:14,044 --> 01:51:15,127
What is it?

1501
01:51:16,459 --> 01:51:18,381
It's our girl.

1502
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:02,077
Never has our country
faced a crisis like this.

1503
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:06,056
Never have our people and our nation

1504
01:53:06,058 --> 01:53:11,058
raised up to a challenge
like we did last month.

1505
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:13,923
And never have we paid a higher price.

1506
01:53:14,858 --> 01:53:18,755
You may say that there are only a few

1507
01:53:18,757 --> 01:53:22,408
who died here, not the thousands

1508
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:25,795
who are still dying as this terrible fire

1509
01:53:25,797 --> 01:53:28,313
burns in our region.

1510
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:32,753
It was my honor and my privilege

1511
01:53:32,755 --> 01:53:35,013
to work with some of those people,

1512
01:53:36,056 --> 01:53:40,294
both the living and the dead.

1513
01:53:40,296 --> 01:53:44,568
And I say to every one of you here today

1514
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:48,833
that I have never, and I will never

1515
01:53:48,835 --> 01:53:51,913
meet a finer group of people.

1516
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,334
But they're not really gone

1517
01:53:55,336 --> 01:53:57,668
and never will be,

1518
01:53:57,670 --> 01:54:00,378
because the memory of them live on

1519
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:02,653
in our hearts and in our minds.

1520
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:07,038
And those precious people who we lost

1521
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:11,015
take with them the prayers
of a grateful nation

1522
01:54:11,017 --> 01:54:12,623
and a grateful world.

1523
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,823
Dr. Ameyo Adadevoh,

1524
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:25,880
Dr. Amos Ebanewu,

1525
01:54:29,545 --> 01:54:31,463
Nurse Justina Echelonu.

1526
01:54:35,185 --> 01:54:39,857
Warden Sister Evelyn Uko.

1527
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,306
They died of a terrible disease,

1528
01:54:46,308 --> 01:54:48,130
brought into our city

1529
01:54:49,988 --> 01:54:51,388
by a sick and terrified man.

1530
01:54:53,385 --> 01:54:56,880
Their death was not in vain.

1531
01:54:58,382 --> 01:55:00,758
And their memory and the memory

1532
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,073
of all the people who
died will never fade.

1533
01:55:05,202 --> 01:55:09,580
Not as long as there is a Nigeria

1534
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,340
to remember them.

1535
01:55:13,607 --> 01:55:17,798
Ebola came to Nigeria

1536
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:20,348
and Nigeria looked Ebola in the face

1537
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:24,245
and said, "No, we will not run,

1538
01:55:24,247 --> 01:55:25,975
"we will not hide.

1539
01:55:25,977 --> 01:55:28,335
"We will not fail.

1540
01:55:28,337 --> 01:55:32,233
"We will act like Nigerians
