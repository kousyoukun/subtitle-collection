0
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:45,070
In the middle of the night,
I have almost like a nightmare.

1
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:51,546
I wake up and I had forgotten
to nail shut the crate.

2
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:54,949
So, I go there
and though it was raining...

3
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,750
I must have waked up
the whole neighbourhood, you know?

4
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:02,156
It was not closing the box,
it was nailing the coffin.

5
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:03,595
I am nailing the coffin.

6
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,128
I, I see it as that.

7
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:06,891
Why, why this expression?

8
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:07,964
Why this thought?

9
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,360
Well, maybe death is now looking...

10
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,596
through the, through the golden frame
of this dream...

11
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,902
...and now reality is going to
maybe choke me to death.

12
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,108
So, now,
I am Tuesday the 6th of August.

13
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:28,981
It was tense, but we were excited.

14
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,749
We were eager to get going.

15
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:33,454
Everything was ready

16
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,025
The Secret Service
did maintain surveillance.

17
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,628
They did so for security reasons,
and I will not go beyond that.

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,265
I have never obstructed justice.

19
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:49,606
And, I think, too, that I could say
that in my years of public life...

20
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,837
...that I welcome
this kind of examination,

21
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,206
because people have got to know

22
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:56,371
whether or not their President
is a crook.

23
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:57,781
Well, I am not a crook.

24
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,378
I have earned everything I have got.

25
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,254
Everybody was getting more
and more nervous and

26
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,663
...finally, we were all ready and said,
'Okay, let's go'.

27
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,928
So, we jump in the truck

28
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:28,911
We're not going to die.
We're going to... to live.

29
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:40,248
I remember the extremely
tense silence in the van

30
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,091
Alan was absolutely sombre

31
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:50,998
Philippe extremely tense

32
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:52,398
As for me I was petrified

33
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,470
Very worried

34
00:02:56,408 --> 00:03:00,276
I was disguised as a removal man
with a helmet, a shirt...

35
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,779
To look American with
lots of pens in my pocket

36
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,144
It seemed to be
a very typical American detail

37
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,955
I was going to be on the crew
in the South Tower.

38
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,561
We were going to go at closing time
with a big hamper...

39
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:18,924
...with all the gear in it...

40
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,297
...and there were going to be
some guys in the North Tower

41
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:25,597
dressed for business
with much less gear.

42
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,332
An architect's tube

43
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,669
and I believe that was holding the bow.

44
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,401
Electricity in the air
between Jean-Louis and Albert.

45
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,878
I can read it in Jean-Louis face he,
he doesn't trust Albert.

46
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:39,916
I had a bad feeling there is
something wrong with this guy.

47
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,782
He is not at all on
the same track that we are.

48
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:45,888
Fear was in the air

49
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,019
I assumed that even in
the best possible situation

50
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,629
that we were all going to be arrested.

51
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:53,762
There was no doubt of that.

52
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,232
I can't imagine how
they didn't feel the same way.

53
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:07,108
I felt that the horizontality of driving
through the streets of Manhattan...

54
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,544
...suddenly became slant.
I was on the ramp.

55
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:12,045
I was being engulfed by the monster.

56
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,078
And Philippe said to me:

57
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,518
I know what is going to happen

58
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,749
We are going to go in,
and we are going to get caught

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,197
It was suddenly not a dream anymore.
It was tangible.

60
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,062
He could not have carried on living
without having tried to

61
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:37,039
At least to conquer those towers

62
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,508
Because those towers had become his.

63
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:44,982
It was as if they had been
built especially for him

64
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,846
Once upon a time...

65
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:57,555
Now, that's how you start fairytales
and actually my story is a fairytale.

66
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,997
Here I am, young, seventeen years old,
with a bad tooth

67
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:10,033
in one of those uncolourful
waiting room of a French dentist,

68
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,262
and it's... it's really lit
with a little forty watt bulb

69
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:15,464
and you have old ladies and people,
you know,...

70
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,370
...sheepishly looking at magazines.

71
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,034
It's quiet and suddenly, I freeze.

72
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:23,443
Because I have
opened a newspaper at a page

73
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:25,447
and I see something magnificent.

74
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:28,678
Something that inspires me,
I see two towers.

75
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,221
And the article says,
'One day those towers will be built'.

76
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,551
They're not even there yet.

77
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:37,022
And when they are they will
become the highest in the world.

78
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,590
Now, I need to have that.
This little tangible start of my dream,

79
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,328
but everybody is watching and...
but I need that page

80
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,405
and so what I do is
under the cover of sneeze... 'aaah...

81
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,471
I tear the page.
Put it under my jacket and go out.

82
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,613
Now, of course, I would have
a toothache for a week,

83
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:59,783
but what's the pain in comparison
that now I have acquired my dream?

84
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:05,817
Usually, when you have a dream,
the object of your dream is tangible.

85
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:08,187
It's there. It's... it's quixotic,

86
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,727
but it's there...
nagging you, you know?

87
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:11,988
Confronting you.

88
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:14,394
But the object of
my dream doesn't exist yet.

89
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:34,810
I was twenty years old

90
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,443
And I was a very shy young girl.
Very, very, shy

91
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:46,283
I was very surprised by this individual

92
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:51,453
And even more surprised when,
having just met me and not knowing me,

93
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:52,987
he chased me relentlessly

94
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,868
Bringing me flowers, arranging dates

95
00:08:57,002 --> 00:09:00,267
Send me love letters, love letters.

96
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:03,738
I was completely overwhelmed,

97
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:08,005
harpooned, it was really that

98
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:16,712
He started to introduce me to his wire

99
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,380
A wire set up at the end of a garden

100
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,789
And I spent hours watching him walk.

101
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,863
He did have that much experience then

102
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,487
He was really at the beginning of
his life as a tightrope walker

103
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:39,501
We had become inseparable

104
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,839
And actually in his life,
I completely forgot mine

105
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,641
and he was not worried either to know

106
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,909
whether I had a path of my own to follow

107
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,643
It was obvious that I had to follow his

108
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:03,725
Annie, who knows me better
than everybody.

109
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:08,128
Annie, who was at my side during
my discovery of the wire.

110
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:11,704
Whose large, green eyes move me.

111
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:14,710
When we embrace,

112
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:18,646
we look like two kids plotting
our next piece of mischief.

113
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:31,156
I started as a young,
self taught wire walker.

114
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:35,892
To dream of...
not so much conquering the universe.

115
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:40,027
But as a poet
conquering beautiful stages.

116
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:52,909
One day he said ...

117
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,810
'I really would like to put
a wire on Notre Dame'.

118
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:01,053
And ...first...
first day I thought it was a joke.

119
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,716
But, in the meantime I knew...

120
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:06,988
I knew that there was something
a little bit real about it ...

121
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:10,659
and then we started to talk more
and more about it,

122
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,426
and then we started to plan it.

123
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,107
Took about a year to find
the right way to do it.

124
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:21,302
Jean louis immediately told me
that it was illegal, yes

125
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,607
So I knew it was illegal

126
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:26,740
and that is what
obviously excited me a little bit

127
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:32,114
But illegal, but not wicked or mean

128
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:33,315
In fact it was wonderful

129
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,025
Can you imagine,
you wake up in the morning,

130
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,186
in the city and...

131
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,595
...and all of a sudden you see
a high wire walker between ...

132
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,059
Notre Dame. It's a dream.

133
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,298
That's what really attracts me.

134
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,477
It's the challenge part
of doing something

135
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,909
that's supposed to be impossible.

136
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,242
And, in the meantime,
doing something that's so beautiful.

137
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:00,613
That doesn't,
not only doesn't hurt anybody,

138
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,413
but gives something to somebody.

139
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:07,355
Then Philippe appeared on the wire

140
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:09,323
It was extraordinary

141
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,367
And I went in, all excited

142
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:24,407
And I found myself there,
and I see, I lean over the nave

143
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,409
I saw that a huge ceremony
was taking place in notre dame

144
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:36,383
There was a dozen priests dressed
all in white, arms in a cross shape

145
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:39,456
They were lying down on the floor,
their heads against the floor

146
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:47,264
I was flabbergasted, silent
and the organist asked me

147
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,991
'But what is happening?
What are you doing here?'

148
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,101
And I said to him
'but there is a high-rope walker,

149
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:52,396
There is a high-rope walker
on the towers!'

150
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,304
And this man looked at me
with a charming expression of wonder

151
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:59,638
And he said to me 'really
a high-rope walker, it is amazing'

152
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,589
The van was down

153
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:50,657
We went through a first gate
with security guards

154
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:56,022
There, we showed papers from
the removal company with receipts,

155
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,828
Well, faked receipts

156
00:13:57,969 --> 00:13:59,436
everything was working fine

157
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:01,564
And now we were horizontal again,...

158
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:04,800
...that we were driving
in the subterranean garage

159
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,877
of the two towers and we were going.

160
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,842
I knew the plan. Ha ha.

161
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:14,278
We were going to the freight elevator
of the South Tower.

162
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,054
It was...
the whole plan was in the making.

163
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,788
The basic plan was very simple.

164
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,763
We had ID cards,
so it was just a matter of

165
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:32,927
just kind of pushing our way through.

166
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,863
Once we'd gotten in the buildings...

167
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,242
It was pretty smooth sailing.

168
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:44,975
At that time we had to part

169
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:48,176
There was such a madness
in his eyes

170
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,617
Such a rage

171
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:56,788
It was really:
whatever happens it was the right time

172
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,226
He held me in his arms as if
we might never see each other ever again

173
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,026
as if we might never see
each other ever again

174
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,469
If I die, what a beautiful death.

175
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:09,437
To die in the...
in the exercise of your passion.

176
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:41,088
We broke into the Sidney Harbor
bridge pylon one night.

177
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:44,959
And er... carried all this equipment
in and put a tightrope up,...

178
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:48,570
...disappeared in the morning and
then sat down on the... on the street...

179
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:51,140
...and watched Philippe,
walk backwards and forwards.

180
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:14,965
The fact that the wire walking activity
is framed by death...

181
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,762
...it's great because then you
have to take it very seriously.

182
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,734
It... it's a little half
a millimeter of mistake...

183
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,673
...or a quarter of a second of
inattention and you lose your life.

184
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,726
This is the Sydney Harbor Bridge
and the traffic was backed up.

185
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,228
The police came, of course,
within minutes.

186
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:13,681
When he was taken away.

187
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:17,124
I mean the first thing he did was
he picked the policeman's watch.

188
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,894
Philippe, manages to take
the guy's watch off his wrist

189
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,365
and hide it in his pocket.

190
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:45,653
These Twin Towers are trotting in
my head, ils trot dans ma tete.

191
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,553
You know I'm galloping in my brain.

192
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:57,134
As I'm back to Paris, slap in the face.

193
00:18:57,435 --> 00:19:00,461
'Paris Match', double page.
'The Twin Towers are built'.

194
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,307
But right now the picture tells me
that those beams are not still covered.

195
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,106
The things are not painted.
I see workers.

196
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:12,910
I imagine maybe for a few more months,
or a year, who knows?

197
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,519
It's in construction and I can sneak in.

198
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:21,057
One day he showed me a picture of

199
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:22,420
two buildings on a newspaper page

200
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,124
And then I was a bit scared

201
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,692
It was inhuman to want to

202
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,735
go and walk up there, 450 meters high

203
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,838
This was becoming demonic.

204
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:36,963
So then I just wanted to say stop.

205
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:49,649
The plan was for me to bring all
my equipment to the eighty-second floor.

206
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:51,482
Which was Barry's hiding place.

207
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,613
There was one in each tower,
the same floor.

208
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:56,727
And to put all the equipment there,
using the freight elevator,

209
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,590
saying,
'delivery for eighty-second floor'.

210
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,594
And Barry,
will be there to receive, okay.

211
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:05,065
At the time I was
an Assistant Director of Research

212
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,364
at The New York State Insurance
Department.

213
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:09,336
We just moved in and I was on,

214
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:13,303
what was then the highest occupied floor
in two World Trade Centre.

215
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:25,187
I knew there was going to be a team
in each tower and er...

216
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,348
...that the stuff was
going to be delivered to me

217
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,585
and then it was
going to be carried up....

218
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,222
...would have been twenty-eight floors.

219
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,898
The operator of the freight elevator,

220
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:37,967
had not completely heard
the foreman shouting,

221
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,399
'eighty-second floor'.

222
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,870
And it was clearly on our delivery bill
and on all the package.

223
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:45,601
He asked to the group,
' What floor again?'

224
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:47,438
Right there, I think, 'this is it!'

225
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:50,076
and I said clearly, 'one-o-four!'

226
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:53,980
'Okay, whatever.
Watch your hands and 'cling'.

227
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,780
The gate clanked shut.

228
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:06,219
Now we are in a plywood box,
in a temporary freight elevator.

229
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:08,127
Going all the way up.

230
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,126
And it's dark, it's a... it's a..
it's travel toward heaven...

231
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,830
...and...and the darkness becomes grey

232
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:18,373
and I see a square of grey
that becomes lighter.

233
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:21,034
I see a square of light. It is the sky.

234
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:27,846
We're getting there and we're arriving
just a few floors below the roof.

235
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,316
With all our equipment.

236
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,856
And he came to my office
and told me that they had by a...

237
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:36,983
a great stroke of fortune....

238
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,892
...gotten...
gotten on the freight elevator....

239
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,627
...and saved themselves twenty floors
of carrying up all that equipment.

240
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,801
Now, I find myself
in a deserted floor,

241
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,400
one-o-four and the first thing
we do is unpack and take equipment out.

242
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,075
Suddenly, I hear a guard coming.

243
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,085
I just look and I see over there a..
a tarp.

244
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,553
So, I just grab John-Francois
and I throw him underneath

245
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,055
and I hear John-Francois, yell.

246
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,519
And this beam was over
the elevator shaft

247
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,150
which was 400 meters deep!

248
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:17,959
What? We're going under it?
Yeah, we had to hide under a tarp.

249
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:21,632
Donald starts saying, 'Hold on my leg,
hold on this, where can I go?'

250
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:22,761
And I kind of like,...

251
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:27,567
...right on the spur of the moment said,
'You know what, man? I can't do this'.

252
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,575
And he's like, 'Okay, go ahead.'

253
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:34,248
'Go, go, quick', and I...I think

254
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:36,546
who was the more happy,
was it Donald or I?

255
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:37,585
but anyway, bye bye Donald.

256
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:40,122
Unbridled glee.

257
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,518
I'm so happy to not have to do this.

258
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:47,091
I'm running down the stairs a hundred
and ten flights.

259
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,291
It's like those dreams
where you never touch down.

260
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,932
It was so beautiful.

261
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:02,577
So, here we are under the tarp,
frozen to death.

262
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:06,012
I don't have to mumble...
to John-Francois, 'don't move'.

263
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,847
He... he feels it in our body....
connection.

264
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:12,347
And now the guard comes.

265
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,083
Has he seen us?

266
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:20,092
Has he heard us?
Has he seen the tarp move?

267
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:25,367
But the guard comes
and leans against the structure....

268
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:28,336
...and he seems to be a foot away.

269
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,932
...and I hear the cracking
of his walkie talkie

270
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:33,202
and I hear he takes a cigarette.

271
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,938
...and the... the sound close-up now of
the lighter and of his first puff.

272
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:40,539
The burning of the extremity of
the cigarette and the fu...

273
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,711
He seems to be almost leaning on my ear.

274
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,479
So, we are, I mean, frozen.
We don't breathe.

275
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,125
We wait for six, six - six-thirty.

276
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:03,868
So, we start to climb.

277
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:09,239
We saw nobody in the stairway.

278
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,940
There is nobody underneath the roof.
Seems pretty safe.

279
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:34,766
All of a sudden
we hear somebody coming....

280
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:39,038
...from the stairway.
So, we.. we scare like hell.

281
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:42,837
So we run to the hiding place
and we jump in the hiding place.

282
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:44,475
We hear some steps.

283
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,340
We hear the walkie-talkie noise.

284
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,783
...and the noises were very confusing.

285
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:01,829
Sometimes,
you don't hear the guy for ten minutes.

286
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,159
So, you think he's gone.
All of a sudden you hear...

287
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:09,039
You hear him coughing or you hear
a talkie-walkie noise like,...

288
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:14,236
...he's right next to the hiding place.
So we, we could not talk.

289
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,142
We started to write little notes.

290
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:27,522
We kept saying, 'Do you think now?
Yeah? Let's wait longer'.

291
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,588
It was uncomfortable, but I... you know?

292
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:33,629
Once you understand
that you don't have a choice,

293
00:25:33,764 --> 00:25:36,255
you try to settle in and...
and just wait.

294
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:44,434
At that point, we're in...in suits.
In business suits.

295
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:47,169
Being in a business suit
with heavy equipment,...

296
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:50,439
...hiding behind a pile of boxes.
I mean there is no explanation.

297
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,309
If we are caught at that time,
that was it.

298
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,259
What if the guard is still around?

299
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,463
What if he is toying with us?

300
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:15,334
Waiting for us to make the slightest
movement before he pounces on us.

301
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,997
We must wait.

302
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:22,775
To ease the torment,
I return to my memories.

303
00:26:23,113 --> 00:26:27,709
The gold and mud, years of dreaming,...

304
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:30,380
...months of organising.

305
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:36,148
I dive back into the past
for a long while.

306
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:41,693
That it will indeed serve
the purposes intended.

307
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,460
And that it will truly promote
not only harmony between the states,

308
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:52,101
but harmony and communication
between the nations of the world.

309
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,305
It was in January of
nineteen-seventy-four.

310
00:26:55,446 --> 00:27:00,679
I climbed on the roof of my little house
and I screamed, 'I'm coming to America!'

311
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:20,659
...and the minute
I got out of the subway,

312
00:27:20,804 --> 00:27:22,271
climbing the steps, looking at them.

313
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:24,840
I knew that they were no dream.

314
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:28,500
I knew that it was...
my dream was destroyed instantly.

315
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:35,507
Impossible. Impossible. Impossible.

316
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,415
It's clearly impossible.

317
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,615
Not only to walk across this high,
I probably hardly thought of it...

318
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:43,591
...but to bring almost like
a ton of equipment secretly...

319
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:46,525
..to rig a wire for hours -
to guy line it.

320
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:50,896
It's clearly out of human scale.

321
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:56,904
But something in me,
pulls me toward touching it.

322
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:09,444
That's when he spoke to me
about his project.

323
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:12,950
He said, 'Well I want to string
a wire between er...

324
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,717
the two World Trade Center Towers'.

325
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,994
I said, ' Okay, sounds wild.'

326
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:21,788
I mean, I'd never met er...
a high wire walker before.

327
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,967
So er, I had no idea what...

328
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:26,262
...nor did I even entertain
the idea at the time

329
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:30,064
of what the consequences of
anything happening would be.

330
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:33,074
It just sounded like a really fun
adventure to get involved in.

331
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,373
So I took it upon myself to say,
'Sure let's ..let's work on it.'

332
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,209
The first occasion we went up
in the elevator...

333
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,447
...we basically took the elevator
to the eighty-sixth floor.

334
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:44,611
When we got off there was a guard there.

335
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,614
He said, ' What are you doing here?',
you know?

336
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,749
So, obviously, we couldn't continue.

337
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,952
So we took the elevator back down again
and then we realised...

338
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,927
well, he actually said,
'Well, let's just walk up.'

339
00:28:57,668 --> 00:29:01,263
Then we proceeded to climb up
the hundred and ten flights to the top.

340
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:10,077
We are at the top of the world.

341
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,018
I see two slabs of concrete,

342
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:19,122
barely inhabited,
with some construction.

343
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:23,659
No fence, no net, no nothing and...
and I am frozen to death.

344
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,291
I see the other tower and I...

345
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:32,027
I imagine the void
and if I were to run...

346
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:36,469
...on the slab
I will just fall to another life.

347
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:48,379
...and slowly I thought, okay,
now it's impossible. That's sure.

348
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,486
So let's start working.

349
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,052
We took pictures of all these things...

350
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:51,984
...thinking that perhaps,

351
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,113
that might be where
the cable will be tied....

352
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:56,658
...or just maybe,
would be a cable we could use.

353
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:01,727
He wasn't sure how he was going
to rig it at that particular time.

354
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:08,234
I decided in the staircase
to draw a little fresco,...

355
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,833
...as if I needed
some tangible proof,...

356
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:17,242
...to show me that I was going through
different steps and approaching...

357
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:20,544
...the impossible of actually finding
myself on that wire.

358
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,252
I even rented a helicopter
at some point

359
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:34,330
and Jim was with me taking pictures,
of the roof, of the equipment there...

360
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,729
...for making a model, for measuring,...

361
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:41,634
...but I also wanted a little bit to see
if it was possible.

362
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:45,436
He wanted to get higher
than where he was going to be

363
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:46,702
when he walked on the wire.

364
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:52,375
It was a way of tricking his mind
into not feeling fear, ...

365
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:53,741
...by being higher than where

366
00:30:53,884 --> 00:30:55,511
he was going to be
when he actually did the walk.

367
00:30:56,253 --> 00:31:00,917
One day I received a post card with a
'W' - World Trade Centre.

368
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,889
I never heard about
the WTC at that time...

369
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:08,489
...and he had drawn a little wire
on top of the towers.

370
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:12,499
I thought of course,
that's why these towers are there.

371
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:13,701
I mean, for Philippe.

372
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:15,836
So, now I go back to France.

373
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,566
The minute I arrive,
I didn't even go home,

374
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,233
I run to Jean-Louis, ...

375
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:24,141
...my old friend, and I said,
'I have a new idea.'

376
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,907
This, we knew that...
legally we could not do it.

377
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:31,452
I mean, nobody knew...
knew Philippe Petit.

378
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:33,419
Nobody knew us,
you go there and you ask,

379
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:35,854
'Can I put a wire on top of
the World Trade Centre'.

380
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:38,154
They'd say, 'Get out'.

381
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:43,524
So, I tried to get some information
from Philippe.

382
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:44,691
So okay, you have, been there.

383
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,735
You... told me you have been
ten times on the top,

384
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,861
but what did you get as...

385
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:50,701
... what do we have as permission?

386
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:53,969
But I have pictures, look,
and we can put the wire...

387
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:57,012
I don't know where to put it,
but we'll find out with the pictures.

388
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:59,105
This one is without the helmet
not translated in UK version

389
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:00,045
This is the best.

390
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,617
Arlier it was a coppers' farm

391
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:07,283
That's what you will be doing
when in prison doing community service.

392
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,392
We will make you clean
the windows of the big towers

393
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:12,786
I started to do... to... a little...

394
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:17,162
recap in my head
and I found out we had nothing.

395
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:21,770
He's not driven by the impetuous
feeling of dancing between the towers.

396
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:23,873
He is driven by,
'I'm going to help Philippe'

397
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:26,032
and 'I don't want to help him
to kill himself' ...

398
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:28,440
...and 'I don't want to be caught
there and we want to succeed',...

399
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,375
...'We don't want to fail'.

400
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:33,745
So, for plenty of reason that are
actually noble and understandable,

401
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:35,647
He becomes almost the...

402
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:39,487
...we fighting a lot on... on....
'You don't have enough elements,

403
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,318
Philippe to build up a serious plan.

404
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:47,559
So, now I go back and this is
the second visit to America.

405
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:55,267
Now I spend my time spying
on The Twin Towers.

406
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:57,669
With all my might.
I...I go day and night.

407
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:02,370
I note things and I fill
the exercise books with all those notes,

408
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:03,774
a little doodling and ...

409
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:06,348
... and er.. I look at what commercially

410
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:09,680
could go underneath
for freight delivery.

411
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,688
I go in. I find a way at lunch time
to disguise myself.

412
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:19,026
The workers seem to arrive
in normal cars.

413
00:33:20,197 --> 00:33:20,822
So, at some point,

414
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:24,832
I am so much into taking notes
as a spy around the Towers,...

415
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:26,959
...I don't see it's a construction site.

416
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:29,971
I don't see one nail sticking out
of one plank.

417
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:36,645
So, right there,
the big nail goes through my sole.

418
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:39,209
Three days in bed.

419
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:43,416
So, here I am with crutches.
Thinking I am incapacitated.

420
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,711
No, no, no, no. It's the opposite.

421
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:48,381
It's wonderful,
a human being with crutches.

422
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,083
The Universe is his.

423
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,660
The guards, you know, help me,

424
00:33:51,795 --> 00:33:53,524
'Can I help you?',
' Let me hold the door.'

425
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,132
People, you know,
'sit down, take your time'.

426
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:58,860
Nobody asked me for an ID, nobody say's,
'what are you doing here?'

427
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:00,867
I... I have this fabulous...

428
00:34:01,004 --> 00:34:04,132
so, then now, even though my feet
is about to be repaired,...

429
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,105
...I use the crutches a lot.

430
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:09,709
Okay? And, sometimes, you would see
the man leaving his crutches

431
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:13,714
and running around to measure something
and coming back and being with crutches.

432
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,303
One time we went up there,
it was very, very windy...

433
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,638
and I.. I actually wasn't sure
why we were going up there.

434
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:44,406
I barely had the courage to get out
of my little trap door...

435
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:47,684
...and, Jim, hanging on,
I don't know how,

436
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:51,219
managed to take a picture of me
hanging on to a post

437
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,813
...at the very roof of the tower
with my body almost horizontally.

438
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:56,987
The wind was blowing me away.

439
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:58,984
So, what if...?

440
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,293
That was very scary.

441
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,864
That was, maybe, one of the first times
I realised how crazy it was up there

442
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,127
with that kind of condition
and the height,

443
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,462
and what we were involved in.

444
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:10,369
What happens if I'm up there
and I rig it and something happens?

445
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:11,599
I just started thinking about
those things

446
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,643
and when we got closer to the er...
actual event....

447
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:17,503
I basically said, ' No, I can't...
I can't help you rig.'

448
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,242
I can't be part of that team
that goes to the top.

449
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:47,275
Here we are, underneath the top of
the World Trade Centre, under a tarp.

450
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:52,810
Each time we would hear a noise,
it was very hard to tell...

451
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:54,348
...if it was a cardboard board,

452
00:35:54,484 --> 00:35:57,976
flapping in the wind or a guard coming
or a walkie talkie.

453
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,054
I drill a little hole
with a paper clip...

454
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:08,130
...and I enlarged this hole
in the canvass

455
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:11,428
with a conic end of a ball point pen.

456
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:17,465
...and then with one eye
I was able to see

457
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:19,802
a little bit of the ambiance light...

458
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:22,411
... going onto the figure of my watch.

459
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:25,675
What time is it?

460
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:26,874
Is it dark outside?

461
00:36:27,017 --> 00:36:29,781
Oh, I heard noise,
let's try to go out of the tarp.

462
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:37,819
We were hum...I had his foot in my nose,
he had my foot,

463
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:40,724
I don't know, in between his arms.
Well, we were completely entwined

464
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,329
There we got to know each other
very well,

465
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,595
We can say like I never knew
a man before.

466
00:36:51,074 --> 00:36:53,872
We kept hearing more
and more noise from the roof.

467
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,009
Like voice, like machines.

468
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:59,510
Sometimes, far away.
Sometimes, very close.

469
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:03,478
But, really, like somebody
was walking on the roof, or something.

470
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,917
Gee, they are walking at night

471
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:07,353
Well, we are stuck.

472
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:10,025
I mean, there is no chance
that it will happen.

473
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:13,528
The longer we waited
and the longer we hid,...

474
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:17,189
...the less time we'd have to do
what we had to do to get up there.

475
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:18,901
There was tension.

476
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:21,835
I thought that we were
both out of our element.

477
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:24,463
That neither of us really
should have been there.

478
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,371
There is something
that I don't trust in this guy.

479
00:37:29,212 --> 00:37:34,149
He's not deeply concerned by anything.
Why is he here?

480
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:46,022
When I finished university
I flew to Paris...

481
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,130
...and I caught up with Philippe,

482
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:51,257
and he showed me this sort of
extraordinary sort of diagram...

483
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:55,337
...and this photograph of this building
that was being constructed in New York.

484
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,205
This is a big one now...
and the wire, a big one.

485
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,639
You know, I looked at
this huge tower or towers...

486
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:05,407
...and Philippe, was just
so enthusiastic about doing this.

487
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,312
So, er... I....

488
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,851
...became I guess one of
the first members of the team.

489
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,041
I intend on a giant meadow...
it's a giant, giant field,...

490
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,411
...to reproduce not the two roof of
the World Trade Center -

491
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,812
I don't have the money for that,...

492
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,648
..but just, you know,
the outline and practice.

493
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:51,884
He wanted to set up a wire

494
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:54,053
the length of the gap
between the two towers

495
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:56,831
To get the most practice beforehand

496
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,828
One, two, three.
I really don't want to fall on that.

497
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,130
Even, even if I miss it doesn't matter.
One, two...

498
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,638
We had a... I guess it was a little bit
of a boot camp or a training camp.

499
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:10,646
Essentially we spent time there,
conceiving er... designing...

500
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,716
...trying to work out how to make
this thing work from every aspect.

501
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:22,418
Somebody had spoken to him about
the elasticity of the structure

502
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:27,923
And that the towers may sway under
the effects of the turbulences,

503
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:31,457
under he effects of the wind.
So there was a moment of great concern

504
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:35,163
So I asked my friends to make
the cable dance.

505
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:38,600
...and here is Mark, the Australian,
here is Jean-Louis, Annie.

506
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:41,072
...and we would jump up
and down on these wires.

507
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:45,045
We'd try and bounce Philippe,
off of the wire.

508
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,328
The World Trade Centre was extraordinary

509
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:04,490
because it was two hundred feet between
the towers.

510
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:08,934
So, how do you get a tightrope
from one tower to the other?

511
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,105
Look, what you will see.

512
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:12,033
Do you like that?

513
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,202
We have to find a way
to throw something.

514
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,844
Then you can pull a little string...

515
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,040
...and then a bigger string
and then a rope...

516
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,309
...and then eventually the wire.

517
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,419
At some point, I mean,

518
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:29,958
I thought even of a little airplane,
radio guided.

519
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:32,724
Football and baseball, yeah...

520
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:35,558
...we have to learn
how to play baseball

521
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,098
for two months before we can do that.

522
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:38,291
No, no, no.

523
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:42,002
..and at some point Jean-Louis,
come up with a really, silly idea.

524
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:43,662
I don't even let him finish
the sentence.

525
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:46,071
He says, 'Philippe,
what about a bow and arrow?'

526
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:47,976
Yeah. Bingo, yeah. Huh?

527
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:52,111
We drilled a very small hole in the...
in the end of an arrow...

528
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,752
... and we attached a monofilament
or a fishing line wire to the arrow.

529
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:58,944
...and the whole idea
would be that Jean-Louis,

530
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,081
would, you know, send the arrow
from one building to another.

531
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,783
...and then, of course,
whenever we tried it...

532
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:07,158
...it just didn't work.

533
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,389
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

534
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,024
In the end we designed a...

535
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:44,099
a spool that had
a conical shape on it...

536
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:46,930
...so that the...
the monofilament would unravel

537
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,935
and go very freely through the air.

538
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:53,736
Here we are.

539
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,549
Hey, just right. Exactly.

540
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:29,542
As a child I loved to climb everywhere.

541
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:31,373
I let the psychiatrist decide why.

542
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:33,778
Maybe I wanted to escape my time.

543
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:36,784
Maybe I wanted to see the world
from a different perspective

544
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,979
and I was an explorer at heart.

545
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:42,214
Who knows and who cares,
but I was a little climber...

546
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,226
...and nobody, not my parents,
not the teachers, nobody could stop me.

547
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:57,202
I heard about wire walkers.

548
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,737
I was described how
they are magnificent men

549
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:02,504
and women walking in thin air.

550
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:05,341
And I thought. 'well, that's nothing.
With my ropes, I do that'.

551
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:41,884
There always was and there still is

552
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:45,249
a bad boy side to Philippe's character.

553
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:47,451
He had a very strict upbringing

554
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,353
So he will never stray too far down
the illegal road

555
00:43:49,492 --> 00:43:51,289
But it is for him a pleasure,

556
00:43:51,427 --> 00:43:57,627
a huge pleasure to allow himself
some of those liberties.

557
00:43:57,867 --> 00:44:01,030
He is so excessive, so creative,

558
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:04,397
That each day is like
a work of art for him.

559
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:24,817
For him, what excited him
most about this adventure

560
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:27,659
Was, apart from being
a really beautiful show

561
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:30,129
Was that it was like a bank robbery

562
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:33,995
and that gave him great pleasure

563
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:39,474
Oh, no.

564
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,274
... 'cause it's not...

565
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:17,303
Eventually things became
progressively more serious

566
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:20,109
Because a proper plan
had to be worked out

567
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:24,242
And the arguments between jean Louis
and Philippe really got started.

568
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:30,348
Mark said, if ...somebody
opened the door in the stairs...

569
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:30,720
Yeah.

570
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:35,797
and see a very serious man, dark,
taking big... this is no good.

571
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:37,092
-Yeah, no, no, no. Not, not.
-Now listen, now listen.

572
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,100
In the stairway,
we can be discovered by anyone.

573
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:45,600
Now, so we have to be a combination
of a workman and an office man.

574
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:49,405
I think this is perfect.
This is perfect and this is no good.

575
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,410
Ok, ok so we get through the gate
at the bottom one way or another,

576
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:52,741
anywhere downstairs.

577
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:54,941
Where it is going to be decisive
is upstairs,

578
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:58,451
When we are going to go
from the elevator to the thing

579
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,579
At that point we need to be more
or less well dressed.

580
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:01,655
Oh no, I would have said
dressed as workmen

581
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:02,883
Wait let me finish

582
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,120
It was impossible
to imagine them getting

583
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:09,060
into the towers clandestinely

584
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:11,166
They didn't even know
what their plan was to get in

585
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,703
And I think that jean-Louis felt
a huge responsibility, from the start

586
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,797
He didn't want to let Philippe know
of the problems.

587
00:46:19,942 --> 00:46:22,001
Maybe a lack of realism
on Philippe's side.

588
00:46:22,645 --> 00:46:24,875
Well I thought about leaving
from downstairs.

589
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:25,776
This is really stupid because
we have got the elevator for free

590
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:28,679
But no, we are being idiots.
Of course we are like idiots.

591
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,979
Jean-Louis knew I was on his side

592
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:34,656
And Philippe also knew that often
I was taking jean-Louis' side

593
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,622
An eighty kilos object, why not do it?

594
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,057
Since long before Barry,

595
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:42,687
Annie has been angling for
an invitation to New York.

596
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:49,899
Using tenderness, blackmail,
threats, insults and tears.

597
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:55,376
But I need absolute detachment.
Complete freedom.

598
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:59,413
I must be a cast away
on a desert island of my dreams.

599
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:11,557
Philippe and I travelled to New York,
together.

600
00:47:11,694 --> 00:47:14,492
I remember looking out through
this hazy airplane window

601
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,497
and seeing in the far distance
the Twin Towers.

602
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:21,035
We'd come all of this way and...

603
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,570
and this was our...
this is what we're here for.

604
00:47:25,074 --> 00:47:30,273
Metropolis, France's number one journal
of urban planning.

605
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:34,348
We are preparing a feature profile
of the workers

606
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:38,614
who are presently constructing
the World Trade Centre in New York.

607
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:42,222
Our credentials reporter,
Philippe Petit...

608
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:45,384
...kindly requests your co-operation
for this article.

609
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,794
He told me he was a French journalist.

610
00:47:49,298 --> 00:47:52,665
...and it was just not normal
for me to say,

611
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:55,202
'show me your credentials,
if you would?'

612
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:57,363
He was going to write a story
about The World Trade Center,

613
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,168
for the French newspapers...

614
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:01,537
...and he had two photographers
with him and...

615
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:04,375
I thought that was pretty
good publicity.

616
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,709
Do you completely trust
the building yourself?

617
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,179
Is it safe up there?
What you mean like tumbling down,

618
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:10,944
falling down or something?

619
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:12,418
-Yeah.
-No, no it's safe.

620
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:14,853
Here was this sort of
long haired Australian...

621
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:17,152
...and this sort of
very volatile Frenchman

622
00:48:17,293 --> 00:48:18,988
who couldn't speak great English.

623
00:48:19,595 --> 00:48:23,861
Saying we were journalists
and we enlisted Jim Moore

624
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,467
and he was the cameraman.

625
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:29,761
It was er... it was interesting,
because er... you know?

626
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:34,104
Here we are disguising ourselves
as someone who we're not and er...

627
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:35,210
perfectly getting away with it...

628
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:36,072
...and it was wonderful.

629
00:48:36,212 --> 00:48:38,305
When you are working here
and when the weather changed, you...

630
00:48:38,447 --> 00:48:40,938
you... you stop because just ...
you cannot work anymore?

631
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:44,211
We start doing a day up here and
all of a sudden the weather gets bad.

632
00:48:44,353 --> 00:48:45,786
-Yeah.
-Well, we have to finish the day.

633
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:46,850
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

634
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:47,956
So, it happens in life,

635
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,887
to work there on the top
with very bad conditions?

636
00:48:50,026 --> 00:48:50,424
Oh, yeah.

637
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,653
Yeah, and you get
a little bit scared of that?

638
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:53,691
No, not really.

639
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,730
I remember Jim, would act like

640
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:57,298
he was taking a photograph of a worker.

641
00:48:57,433 --> 00:48:59,492
Then at the same time
he'd put the camera down

642
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,660
and he'd take a photograph of a pylon...

643
00:49:01,804 --> 00:49:04,295
...or an anchor point
or something like that.

644
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:09,243
The towers were
not corners facing corners.

645
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:10,743
They were askew.

646
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,513
Which was a problem for me
to decide where to put my wire.

647
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,677
So in principle,
that's a cable across the two roofs.

648
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,051
I decided to attach the cable to what

649
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,058
I believe were the strongest beam
at the top of the roof,

650
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:27,788
...and then I'm going to tie
the wire to...

651
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,265
...here, on the South Tower.

652
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,700
A cable between two buildings -
a very long length - it sways.

653
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:37,704
It goes up and down

654
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,868
and there is almost an invisible move
which is a torsion on itself.

655
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:46,106
So, what we devise is a ... it's...

656
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,315
it's called a cavalety
in the circus parlance.

657
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:51,113
It's actually a guy line.

658
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:54,587
That is perpendicular
to the axis of the wire

659
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:56,851
and it goes down to the ground.

660
00:49:57,193 --> 00:49:58,125
Even with permission,

661
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,024
we couldn't go a quarter
of a mile to the ground.

662
00:50:00,162 --> 00:50:01,823
Plus I needed a pair.

663
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:03,989
Here's one and here's two.

664
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:05,657
We know they cannot go down.

665
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:10,029
So the solution was asymmetric rigging.

666
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,264
Which is like this.

667
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:13,966
Here's the first attachment.

668
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:17,737
Each cavalety had two legs
a short one and a long one.

669
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,943
So, this is what I decided
was the best for the situation.

670
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,614
And now I am preparing for le coup.

671
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:29,291
We are going to do it.

672
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,723
I arrived Saturday
and le coup is due on Monday.

673
00:50:35,231 --> 00:50:37,529
He is more and more ready for the coup

674
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,430
But the coup itself is not ready.

675
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:42,301
...and I was
very frustrated about that.

676
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:47,306
I knew we had to act quickly
and I knew we had nothing.

677
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:48,205
Jean-Louis, wants to know.

678
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:50,778
So, 'Have you done this like
I asked you to do...

679
00:50:50,913 --> 00:50:53,211
...and what is my answer
about when the guard and...?'

680
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:55,146
and I don't satisfy him with my answer.

681
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,445
So he attacks my non preparations,

682
00:50:57,586 --> 00:51:00,316
when actually I feel
that I have prepared immensely.

683
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:03,286
I think the longer we were there,

684
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:06,020
the longer I was cognizant
of the fact that....

685
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:11,162
...it was a very ambitious pursuit,
what we were doing.

686
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,392
We have to mount everything.

687
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:13,600
We just weren't ready.

688
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:17,763
Er.... means,
more suede we must put the screw...

689
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:21,604
I never doubted Philippe's, talent,
his prowess on the wire.

690
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:24,212
It was the unforeseen things
that really worried me.

691
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,178
If, I need the cavalities or not.

692
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:29,307
You know, America's,
a very litigious society and er...

693
00:51:29,452 --> 00:51:32,546
...you know, involuntary manslaughter,
assisted suicide.

694
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:34,918
...a little bit.
Then we put everything down.

695
00:51:35,057 --> 00:51:38,185
I didn't want to be liable
for the death of a friend.

696
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,464
Well, he could clearly see
that we were not ready.

697
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,727
Everybody could see it,
but Philippe and...

698
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:47,994
at the time I gave up.

699
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:52,506
Obviously,
with the Australian not there.

700
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:54,006
With the...obviously the...

701
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:57,135
the whole thing is...
is a total debacle.

702
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:03,312
...and I told him....'okay,
so Philippe, what do you think now?'

703
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:06,146
'It's ...May thirtieth,
we're supposed to go,

704
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:07,414
to do the coup today'.

705
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:09,491
'Do you think we can do it like that?'

706
00:52:10,192 --> 00:52:11,250
...and he said, 'No'.

707
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:15,755
He said, 'No, it's clear that
it's impossible' and I said, '

708
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:16,865
No, it's not impossible.

709
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:19,559
It is possible,
I mean we are very close to it.'

710
00:52:21,937 --> 00:52:24,269
If you want something,
nothing is impossible.

711
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,305
We kept repeating,
'I'll be back, I'll be back'.

712
00:52:27,443 --> 00:52:29,001
We'll prepare it and we'll do it.

713
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,876
The first attempt had failed

714
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:35,674
And he called me.
I had to go over urgently.

715
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:41,279
Obviously my role was to keep his moral
up and to give him courage back.

716
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:49,762
And so it was always a matter of

717
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:51,594
understanding what was happening
in his head,

718
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:56,433
Encouraging, er...
I had this role and it was very tiring.

719
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,073
He used to watch television
sometimes halfway through the night.

720
00:53:03,212 --> 00:53:08,775
He was only watching police shows,

721
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:12,115
bank robberies,
stories of policemen and thieves.

722
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:15,956
I am convinced he was getting
into shape with this.

723
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:21,328
Looking for the strength

724
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,194
To break into these towers...

725
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:28,666
So we were going back over
and over again

726
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:32,069
to the world trade center,
to the main entrance hall

727
00:53:32,274 --> 00:53:35,300
And Philippe was observing
how people were getting in.

728
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:37,503
They were showing passes.

729
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:39,773
He was observing
as many things as possible.

730
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:42,915
I saw him in...in...

731
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:46,852
in the lobby and it was just somebody
that didn't belong there,...

732
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:51,449
...like someone who had come out...
it was just...it was just er...

733
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:54,893
...a wrong juxtaposition.
It just was very, very odd.

734
00:53:55,030 --> 00:54:00,764
'Philippe, it's...it's wonderful to see
you' and his...his name is Barry...

735
00:54:00,903 --> 00:54:04,202
...and he has seen me street juggling
in Paris.

736
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:11,041
Well, he started talking and telling me
all this wire walking that he did.

737
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:13,442
...and I think I said at some point,

738
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:16,073
'If you're thinking of doing
The World Trade Center forget it.'

739
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:19,483
But he er...
he sort of draws you in to ...

740
00:54:19,622 --> 00:54:20,646
his world...

741
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:22,950
...and I guess
I was the kind of guy who was not

742
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:26,186
averse to doing things
that were slightly er....

743
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:30,424
...er...you know?
Not, not totally legal.

744
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:33,900
Barry, calls me and says,
' Philippe, ...

745
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:36,266
I'm sorry to tell you,
but the security around

746
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:38,396
The World Trade Center in general,
has changed...

747
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,009
...and now we all are
forced to carry an ID.'

748
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:45,512
'But I happen to have mine freshly
unsealed from the envelope

749
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:47,172
.... and it will not be too much trouble

750
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:49,409
to abandon it in your hands
for a few hours.'

751
00:54:49,718 --> 00:54:55,054
He did this incredibly artistic,
perfect job of copying it and...

752
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,591
...getting an ID card
with his own picture on it.

753
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:07,833
One day he called me and he said,...

754
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:11,098
...'Well, I've found two
or three American guys....

755
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,700
...They are crazy, they are great
and they are ready to help.'

756
00:55:15,911 --> 00:55:20,848
I meet two American...
young men, Donald and Chester.

757
00:55:22,017 --> 00:55:25,145
We met with Petit and
I had a friend named Alan Wellman,

758
00:55:25,287 --> 00:55:26,686
who I went to High School with.

759
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:29,650
He was always up for an adventure.
Always.

760
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:33,259
I think that Petit, knew also that
this guy was a quality guy.

761
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:36,196
Certainly, smart.

762
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:40,564
Certainly, aware of himself
and knowing his limits.

763
00:55:40,703 --> 00:55:42,102
The ideal accomplice.

764
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:45,371
He was pitching it.
He was presenting it.

765
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:49,533
He was desperately,
sort of, proposing it,...

766
00:55:49,678 --> 00:55:53,512
...in a way that you would, you know,
sell a time share or something.

767
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,279
I knew he was a nut
or a con man or something,

768
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,320
but he seemed harmless enough.

769
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:05,124
I didn't really take it seriously
at that point.

770
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:09,691
I need to practice
a little bit on the wire ...

771
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:12,096
...and I need mostly to show my two,

772
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:14,327
three American friends
how to hook the cable,

773
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,732
how to help Jean-Louis.

774
00:56:19,608 --> 00:56:21,599
That's when I saw him on a cable.

775
00:56:23,245 --> 00:56:25,645
I had never seen concentration
like that.

776
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:28,048
...and I think I never have to this day.

777
00:56:28,517 --> 00:56:30,178
...and his face became this...

778
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:35,913
...ageless mask of concentration.
I mean, he became like a sphinx.

779
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:36,921
It was amazing.

780
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:54,601
He did it beautifully
and calmly and er...

781
00:56:54,743 --> 00:56:58,042
....he just did it in fact,
literally with his eyes closed.

782
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,838
It was just what he does.

783
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:01,976
Everything he told me was true.

784
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,894
I was worried. I was worried.

785
00:57:19,368 --> 00:57:23,395
The team was made of
people completely unreliable

786
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:34,278
I don't remember right now
when we fixed the date,

787
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:37,510
but we had fixed the date
for August seven.

788
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:42,447
Jean Louis reminded me of Notre dame

789
00:57:42,591 --> 00:57:44,491
and he said it was
more or less the same.

790
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:48,153
That it was the same adventure but
in New York at the world trade center.

791
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:50,458
But he has not told me anymore.

792
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,033
He only asked me if
I wanted to come or not? That's all.

793
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:55,432
Jean-Louis arrives and I go

794
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:57,266
and pick him up at the airport
and he's...

795
00:57:57,406 --> 00:57:59,806
He's with Jean-Francois and
of course I remember Jean-Francois.

796
00:57:59,942 --> 00:58:02,638
He's an adorable,
little apparition and he's all smiles.

797
00:58:02,778 --> 00:58:04,075
He doesn't have any questions.

798
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:06,374
He's just will follow.
He's here to help.

799
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:11,781
It is only when I arrived in New York,
Coming out of the train from Boston,

800
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,411
At some point we went pass
the empire state building.

801
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:18,660
And there I looked up,

802
00:58:18,794 --> 00:58:20,819
I watched the height of
the empire state building

803
00:58:20,963 --> 00:58:22,590
And I was petrified.

804
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,158
My knees started shaking,
it was frightening

805
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:29,494
Knowing that the world trade center
was even taller.

806
00:58:29,638 --> 00:58:32,869
I kept everything to myself.
I did not say anything. I was petrified.

807
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:42,208
When I was a boy

808
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:46,049
I dreamed of Philip Marlowe

809
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:49,082
He took me as his partner.

810
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:53,160
When Jean-Louis came back
the tension rose enormously

811
00:58:53,295 --> 00:58:55,889
It had become unbearable.

812
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:57,464
The problem was the team.

813
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:02,929
Gave me shot gun fever.

814
00:59:04,673 --> 00:59:06,436
I met the first two guys...

815
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:10,508
...and one of them was musician,
the other one,

816
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:12,773
I think was a carpenter.
I don't know what.

817
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:16,408
...and
...they really looked liked losers.

818
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:20,181
I mean, I'm sorry, but like...

819
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,024
When I saw these guys I thought,
'Oh, my God'.

820
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,419
...loves me

821
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:33,666
The night before the coup,
they came in the flat

822
00:59:34,503 --> 00:59:37,199
In a deplorable state.

823
00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:39,398
One of them had been smoking.

824
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:43,307
He was completely gone,
lost in a haze of smoke.

825
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:47,540
Jean-Louis was absolutely dismayed.
So was Philippe.

826
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,048
It's likely I was...
probably had been smoking pot.

827
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,655
Yeah, likely as all hell.

828
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:57,991
I smoked pot every day
for thirty-five years.

829
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,285
There's no reason to think
I didn't smoke that day.

830
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:06,893
...and when Jean-Louis, meet Albert,
he has a little intuition.

831
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:09,026
I can read it in Jean-Louis' face.

832
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:10,661
He doesn't trust Albert.

833
01:00:11,707 --> 01:00:14,574
You know you have this feeling
with people and...

834
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,976
...sometimes it's wrong,
but...but you can't help it anyway.

835
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:22,640
We shook hands, said 'hello'.

836
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:26,449
They didn't speak English,
I spoke no French.

837
01:00:26,655 --> 01:00:29,317
So, there wasn't too much...to say.

838
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:34,919
Just...'Nice to meet you, good luck,
let's do what we have to do.'

839
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:59,250
When I felt that
the whole floor finally

840
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,447
was silent and the darkness is there,...

841
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:02,887
...I venture out.

842
01:01:05,093 --> 01:01:08,654
Imagine staying three hours on a beam,
you cannot walk.

843
01:01:08,997 --> 01:01:09,895
You need re-education.

844
01:01:10,032 --> 01:01:12,933
A normal human being staying
completely unmoving on a beam

845
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:15,059
for three hours cannot walk.

846
01:01:22,144 --> 01:01:25,580
After a while I said,
'We cannot wait anymore.'

847
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:27,480
I told Albert,

848
01:01:27,849 --> 01:01:31,182
'You know what you should go,
because if I go if I'm caught...

849
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,185
there is no way
we can do the rigging,...

850
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,483
...because I'm the only one who knows

851
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,589
about Philippe's habit
and how to do it.'

852
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:45,625
So he goes on the top
and comes back five minutes later.

853
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:46,959
I'm sure I just said,

854
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:49,502
' Okay, let's go.
Let's just get this done.'

855
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:53,839
So, he said, 'Great, we don't know
what this noise comes from,

856
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,170
but let's go...'

857
01:01:55,577 --> 01:02:00,105
...and now we moved and we go for
the most important equipment.

858
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:03,750
I mean a wire walker needs
a cable to walk on.

859
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:05,711
Now we are walking toward

860
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:08,914
a tiny little construction staircase,
very narrow.

861
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:11,048
...and he's in front
and I'm in the back.

862
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,461
I see a nightmare.

863
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:17,528
A policeman and the policeman has
his eyes open and he's looking at me.

864
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,497
There was someone
that we had not expected,

865
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,763
Sitting at a desk, with a little light.

866
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:25,667
I decide to hold him.

867
01:02:25,807 --> 01:02:27,900
...but hold on, he is pushing me.

868
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:31,145
The same way I am holding him,
the same way he is pushing me.

869
01:02:31,446 --> 01:02:32,606
What is happening?

870
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:36,046
There is no way I can get
Jean-Francois to turn around.

871
01:02:36,184 --> 01:02:38,209
So, let's play his game. Let's follow.

872
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:45,221
We were very silent because
we didn't have shoes on...

873
01:02:45,627 --> 01:02:48,357
...and when we arrived on the top,
I whispered, ' Did you see the guard?'

874
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:49,825
He said, ' Of course I saw the guard

875
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:52,263
and I was trying to alert you
by pushing you,

876
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,766
but why did you resist?'

877
01:02:53,902 --> 01:02:55,233
I said, ' Well I was trying to resist,

878
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:57,201
to have you turn around and for me
to explain without words and....

879
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:03,702
I remember very well the vastness
of New York, the height,

880
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:10,148
The tiny size of the statue of liberty,
The un building so tiny.

881
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:14,278
The noises,
they were noises of police sirens

882
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,482
all night long and it was amazing.

883
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,753
It is really lively.
In fact it was really lively.

884
01:03:19,895 --> 01:03:20,862
We were the kings.

885
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:24,159
The most beautiful moment is
when I see a shape.

886
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:27,029
Actually, two silhouettes
on the other tower.

887
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,461
...and I recognise immediately
in the darkness,

888
01:03:29,604 --> 01:03:32,300
it is the silhouette of Jean-Louis
and the silhouette of Albert.

889
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:33,465
They made it.

890
01:03:34,609 --> 01:03:36,668
When I saw them on the roof,
I was so happy.

891
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:41,209
...and the impression I got...
I remember that all the time, it's...

892
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:42,247
...you go on the roof,

893
01:03:42,384 --> 01:03:45,820
it's all dark and there is
this red light for the planes, you know,

894
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:49,923
That's turning and that's like a...
like a metronome,...

895
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,917
...giving you an idea of time going by.

896
01:03:54,663 --> 01:03:57,154
There was peace and immensity and I..

897
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:59,392
I... in the middle of
all this madness...

898
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:01,593
...I suddenly had hope and joy.

899
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,727
So, I put, like a bat, actually...

900
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:26,825
I put Jean-Francois,

901
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:29,487
upside down in that
little staircase opening.

902
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:31,428
Just his head showing.

903
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,931
So imagine what the guard
must have seen if he were awake.

904
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,972
He would have seen a human being head,
looking at him upside down.

905
01:04:46,948 --> 01:04:50,008
First thing I did, I prepared my bow.

906
01:04:58,126 --> 01:05:04,031
Prepare the arrow and prepare
the fishing line and wait for them.

907
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:14,398
So, there was this signal
for Jean-Louis,

908
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,875
to say, 'I am ready to shoot'...

909
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,272
...and there was
a signal for me to say,

910
01:05:19,414 --> 01:05:21,507
'I saw your signal. I am ready'

911
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:25,308
...and I'm going to count till ten
and then he will shoot...

912
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:27,751
...but there were no signal
for 'I am not ready'.

913
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:31,251
I hadn't thought of that
and I was not ready.

914
01:05:32,494 --> 01:05:36,089
Finally, they...they
...give this big signal.

915
01:05:36,231 --> 01:05:37,163
I am ready.

916
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:41,528
I have been waiting for so long,
that when he finally...

917
01:05:42,037 --> 01:05:46,133
...gives a signal, instinctively,
I took the...the bow

918
01:05:46,274 --> 01:05:48,105
I aim and I aim at him.

919
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:52,778
And he was almost at the edge of the...
of the building.

920
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,040
I go hunting for the arrow.

921
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,087
Nothing!

922
01:06:01,456 --> 01:06:04,050
Out of frustration,
I take all my clothes off

923
01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:06,786
and I think that, the line,
I will feel...

924
01:06:06,928 --> 01:06:09,829
the line on my naked...skin.

925
01:06:13,835 --> 01:06:17,464
With a defeated heart,
I climb down to the edge...

926
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:22,168
...and I feel a dancing,
fishing line caressing my thigh.

927
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:26,505
The arrow was actually balancing...

928
01:06:27,582 --> 01:06:31,746
... precariously on the very edge
of the building's corner.

929
01:06:32,153 --> 01:06:33,745
A... a little fu...

930
01:06:34,055 --> 01:06:39,049
a little blow, and it was breezy,
would have simply made it fall.

931
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:45,298
The first thing
we did after a few ordinares....

932
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:48,163
a few little ropes getting bigger
and bigger and stronger,

933
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:50,567
was to bring a burlap bag.

934
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,537
And this bag was carrying

935
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:58,271
the very important item
of the communication.

936
01:06:58,546 --> 01:06:59,513
The interphone.

937
01:07:00,148 --> 01:07:03,549
A little tinny,
toy intercom is connected.

938
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:07,246
...and we hear Philippe's voice
on the other end

939
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:09,414
and that was an important moment.

940
01:07:09,557 --> 01:07:13,357
Now the four of us are together,
work is truly going to begin.

941
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:14,754
The guard leaves.

942
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,693
So Francois is...hardly can talk,

943
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:19,095
his head has been upside down
for so long.

944
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:22,202
...but we go back. We rush.
We get our shoes...

945
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:24,935
...and now we bring the equipment
like mad people...

946
01:07:25,073 --> 01:07:28,406
...and I put a little trap
in the staircase.

947
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:31,868
...and that will be like an alarm clock.

948
01:07:32,013 --> 01:07:33,742
We'll be, ' ah,
somebody's getting on your roof'.

949
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:36,812
By the time everything was perfect.

950
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:39,386
I mean, it was...not even midnight.

951
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:42,422
It was... normal rigging
that means within

952
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:46,118
three hours everything
would have been perfect.

953
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,798
Now we are ready to pull the wire.

954
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:52,297
Philippe, has a wire ready.

955
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,163
The nylon rope is.... in our hand.

956
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:56,861
We are ready.

957
01:07:57,005 --> 01:08:02,272
At some point, I...
gave probably too much cable.

958
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:06,303
..and all of a sudden
I see the wire going...

959
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:07,975
...a tremendous noise.

960
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:09,413
I thought, 'my God, what's going on?'

961
01:08:11,953 --> 01:08:13,318
We almost lost the wire.

962
01:08:15,523 --> 01:08:16,990
So, I called Philippe,
'What's going on?'

963
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,717
He said, ' Yeah, we could not hold it.'

964
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:22,728
Which was very unfortunate.

965
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,495
The fact that I didn't speak French.

966
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:31,632
So, I couldn't hear the details of
what was going wrong,

967
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:33,331
was probably just as well.

968
01:08:36,244 --> 01:08:37,768
So, we had to pull .....

969
01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:43,011
...probably more than a hundred metres
of wire plus rope.

970
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:46,881
I don't remember how much we gained
with each attempt.

971
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,819
Maybe we worked hard for one minute,

972
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:51,221
two minutes, three minutes,
four minutes...

973
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,851
...and got a tiny bit of
this endless cable up there.

974
01:08:54,996 --> 01:08:59,228
Within, I don't know, half an hour it
became almost impossible.

975
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,099
Here we are in big trouble.

976
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,198
Somebody is coming on the roof

977
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:14,678
Jean- Francois,
hears also and he hides immediately.

978
01:09:15,517 --> 01:09:17,417
...and I see him,
he's like a dead animal.

979
01:09:18,686 --> 01:09:21,712
As a child, have you ever played
'hide and seek', in a park...

980
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:25,553
...and take refuge behind
a giant tree trunk?

981
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:27,524
...and then a policeman comes
to the roof.

982
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:31,962
...and then your companion comes.
Circles the trunk, he walks, you walk.

983
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,089
He stops, you stop.

984
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:35,327
The man starts turning
around this obstacle

985
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:36,664
in the centre of my tower...

986
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,638
...and I turn around on the side,
diametrically opposed.

987
01:09:39,774 --> 01:09:42,334
This little pas de deux,
could go on forever.

988
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:45,503
Until one of you turn around
and bump into each other.

989
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:47,171
Well, this is exactly what happened.

990
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:51,081
He turns, I turn. He stops, I stop.
He go on, I go on.

991
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,514
Now, of course,
if he would have turned around, oops!

992
01:09:54,856 --> 01:09:55,618
Hide and seek.

993
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:14,401
Albert was starting to...

994
01:10:14,742 --> 01:10:16,266
to give up, to argue, to say,

995
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:17,901
'No, I don't want to do
his anymore.

996
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:20,879
It's not possible.
We are not going to do it'.

997
01:10:21,216 --> 01:10:23,548
It was clear we weren't
going to get this job done...

998
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:25,152
...but there was no arguing with him.

999
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:28,551
There was just...you know?
It was useless.

1000
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:31,649
He was just going to go ahead,
regardless.

1001
01:10:32,393 --> 01:10:33,621
It's impossible.

1002
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:35,729
Impossible, that he thought we were

1003
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:38,389
going to be able to rig
this before daylight.

1004
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,429
Imagine being...
after these months of preparation.

1005
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:48,099
These months of all that
and finally being on the roof.

1006
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:51,906
On the roof and having to stop
because the wire is like that.

1007
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:53,308
I mean, fu...

1008
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:56,747
At dawn, I assumed well the jig is up,
you know?

1009
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:01,754
We, we did the best and now, you know,
let's get out of here.

1010
01:11:15,003 --> 01:11:16,129
The streets were deserted

1011
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:21,803
And I found a taxi willing
to take me there.

1012
01:11:23,211 --> 01:11:27,580
So I waited with the others
Other people came to join us,

1013
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:29,616
others from the team

1014
01:11:31,152 --> 01:11:33,620
And our eyes were absolutely glued...

1015
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:36,053
...To the towers.

1016
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,819
I was looking out for
the slightest movement

1017
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:40,488
but we couldn't see anything.

1018
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,695
It was absolutely terrifying.

1019
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:51,505
It was a misty day and I thought 'ee,
that sucks'.

1020
01:11:52,507 --> 01:11:53,906
...and it wasn't windless either.

1021
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:57,136
There was a little bit of air
that morning.

1022
01:11:57,512 --> 01:11:59,605
...and you could see when the er...

1023
01:12:00,548 --> 01:12:02,209
when the...
when the cable was up there...

1024
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,450
...and it looked very, very slack.

1025
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:23,194
I pulled like crazy,
like crazy, like crazy.

1026
01:12:23,871 --> 01:12:25,133
Finally, I got the wire.

1027
01:12:25,773 --> 01:12:30,540
For some reason, the last metre
was the one that came the easiest.

1028
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:35,282
Despite the abandon of...
of his co-accomplice.

1029
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,646
Jean-Louis has his
last communication almost was,

1030
01:12:38,786 --> 01:12:41,414
'Philippe, I did it, I did it.
I've got two clamps.

1031
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:43,547
We did it, the cable is anchored.'

1032
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:54,262
All of a sudden we see this black spot,
coming down off the top of the towers...

1033
01:12:54,402 --> 01:12:55,994
..and we didn't know what...
what the hell it was.

1034
01:12:56,137 --> 01:12:57,798
I was like, 'Oh my god,
what the is that?' You know?

1035
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:03,035
We saw something, a shape, a shape,
a second, falling down from up there.

1036
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:05,304
I saw this thing falling down...

1037
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:11,345
...and I... I couldn't believe it
and I said to myself,...

1038
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:14,483
...'That's it, you've been fooling
yourself this whole time.

1039
01:13:14,822 --> 01:13:19,452
He went straight down with the first
step off the roof. He might me dead.'

1040
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:26,866
We all had a huge cry of relief.
It was only a piece of clothing.

1041
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:29,595
We thought ' he dropped something.
It is not too bad.

1042
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:43,311
On the top of...Philippe's roof,

1043
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:46,477
there was a big wheel of the...
the machines.

1044
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:48,885
So as soon as the elevator would move,

1045
01:13:49,023 --> 01:13:52,982
we would see
the wheel starting to...to turn.

1046
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:59,664
I scream, 'La roue, la roue!',
to Jean-Francois.

1047
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:00,768
'The wheel, the wheel!'

1048
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:04,201
Because I see the giant wheel
starting in motion

1049
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,364
...and I know my fate
has been written now.

1050
01:14:06,507 --> 01:14:08,737
Time is no longer smiling at me.

1051
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:14,313
At that time I was really worried.

1052
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:16,815
I think, the first time
I was really scared.

1053
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,947
Oh, my God, he's...
he's exhausted like I am.

1054
01:14:21,089 --> 01:14:23,614
Maybe not as much,
but for what he has to do...

1055
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:29,060
It's really not a good thing.
The wire is the worst wire we ever....

1056
01:14:30,598 --> 01:14:34,125
...did and... I was really scared.

1057
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,437
We all thought that obviously
he could fall

1058
01:14:41,142 --> 01:14:43,508
We all thought about it
but we could not believe it.

1059
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:45,705
We thought about it
but we could not believe it.

1060
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:55,781
...and I had to make a decision...

1061
01:14:55,923 --> 01:15:00,622
...of shifting my weight from
one foot anchored to the building,

1062
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,753
to the foot anchored on the wire.

1063
01:15:04,932 --> 01:15:07,025
This is probably, I don't know...

1064
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:10,137
probably the end of my life...
to step on that wire...

1065
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:13,900
...and on the other hand,
something that I could not resist...

1066
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:16,669
...and I didn't make
any effort to resist

1067
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,574
called me upon that cable...

1068
01:15:21,816 --> 01:15:24,341
...and death is very close.

1069
01:15:54,749 --> 01:15:59,550
I start walking as a wire walker
who is studying his cable.

1070
01:16:00,755 --> 01:16:03,849
...and instead of doing an entire study
of the cable for the whole length.

1071
01:16:03,991 --> 01:16:06,186
Seeing the first cavality
and keep walking.

1072
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:08,887
Seeing the middle which
is so soft and treacherous.

1073
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,294
Seeing the second cavality
how it is, no.

1074
01:16:11,432 --> 01:16:14,924
I do only go to the first cavality
and I know enough.

1075
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:17,604
Now, I'm going to perform.

1076
01:16:22,009 --> 01:16:23,704
I saw his face changing.

1077
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:27,641
He was very tense and all of a sudden
there was something...

1078
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:29,845
like a relief in him.

1079
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,914
...and from that time I thought,
that's it.

1080
01:16:33,187 --> 01:16:35,052
He is secure. It's good.

1081
01:16:35,456 --> 01:16:37,390
...and wow, that's...

1082
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:53,904
I saw Philippe.

1083
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,977
I saw Philippe, up there.
It was extraordinary.

1084
01:16:57,445 --> 01:16:59,709
It was so, so beautiful.

1085
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:05,886
It was as if he was walking on a cloud

1086
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:11,925
And there was some amazing moments;
he lay down.

1087
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:18,965
And it was amazing to see this picture
of Philippe laying down up there.

1088
01:17:26,107 --> 01:17:29,907
And then the other very
very strong moment was when he erm...

1089
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:35,674
He is so high on these lines.
It was so beautiful

1090
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:40,120
And when he knelt down

1091
01:17:40,421 --> 01:17:44,881
There was a moment when
he knelt down and saluted,

1092
01:17:51,232 --> 01:17:55,601
And so I was shouting 'look,
look' people started to gather around

1093
01:17:55,736 --> 01:17:56,930
but no one could see him.

1094
01:17:57,138 --> 01:18:00,835
They said to me
'but what are you looking at?'

1095
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:02,741
I said to them a wirewalker,

1096
01:18:02,877 --> 01:18:05,971
Look a wirewalker
and he is walking and walking.

1097
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,950
I sit down on the wire
in one of my crossing

1098
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:13,883
and I did something that amazed people.

1099
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:15,750
I actually looked all the way down,

1100
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:19,256
to look at something that I will never
in my life see again.

1101
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,691
So, I can tell you - and just,

1102
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,891
probably it's a lie,
but to me it's not...

1103
01:18:27,034 --> 01:18:29,559
I heard the crowd.
I saw the crowd.

1104
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:32,036
I hear them murmur.

1105
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:42,410
Beyond anything you could ever imagine,
It's just mind boggling.

1106
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:46,746
The awe of the event...

1107
01:18:46,887 --> 01:18:51,085
...and the overwhelming largeness of
the scale of the situation,...

1108
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:55,025
...took my mind into a place where I
really wasn't that concerned about him.

1109
01:18:55,162 --> 01:19:00,657
It just...it was...magical.
It was just....it was just profound.

1110
01:19:20,354 --> 01:19:21,753
Officer Meyers and I,

1111
01:19:22,156 --> 01:19:25,956
observed the er...tight rope dancer,

1112
01:19:26,093 --> 01:19:28,027
because you couldn't call him
a walker...

1113
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:32,432
er.. approximately half way
between the two towers...

1114
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,266
...and...upon seeing us,
he started to smile and laugh.

1115
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,603
They don't know how to react
to a day- dreaming,

1116
01:19:42,743 --> 01:19:45,337
wire walker, laying down
and dialoguing with a seagull.

1117
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:47,879
So, they were really mad.

1118
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:52,850
Philippe did progress because
that is his work and besides it is his,

1119
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:54,318
it is his character.

1120
01:19:54,455 --> 01:19:56,650
Actually he would come close
to the guards

1121
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:58,088
who were trying to grab him
or the police.

1122
01:19:58,225 --> 01:19:59,385
I can't remember if it was the police.

1123
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:03,520
And then he would turn around
and be out of their reach

1124
01:20:03,664 --> 01:20:05,689
The guards weren't about
to get on the wire.

1125
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,967
When he got to the building,

1126
01:20:07,101 --> 01:20:09,296
we'd ask him to get off
the high wire,...

1127
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:12,463
...but instead he turned around
and ran back out into the middle.

1128
01:20:13,174 --> 01:20:16,041
Everybody was spellbound
in the watching of it.

1129
01:20:17,812 --> 01:20:20,872
When we observed to the fact that
he wasn't about to come in

1130
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:23,074
because he seemed
to be enjoying it so much...

1131
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:25,447
we mentioned the fact to his associate,

1132
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:27,143
that if he did not come in we would

1133
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:30,155
have a helicopter pluck him up off
of the wire.

1134
01:20:30,558 --> 01:20:36,428
At which time, his er...
associate spoke to him in French...

1135
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:38,321
er.. being that he's a Frenchman.

1136
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,400
'Philippe!'...You know?

1137
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:43,059
..and he said,
'The police are going to dislodge you.

1138
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:44,034
Well, you should stop...'

1139
01:20:44,171 --> 01:20:48,540
...and I was...I was madly...
enraged by that,

1140
01:20:48,676 --> 01:20:50,143
but also it saved my life.

1141
01:20:50,277 --> 01:20:52,677
Hey, there's somebody out there
on a tightrope walk,

1142
01:20:52,813 --> 01:20:54,906
between the two towers of
The World Trade Center.

1143
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:56,744
Right at the tippy-top.

1144
01:20:58,786 --> 01:21:01,448
I personally figured
I was watching something

1145
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:03,853
that somebody else would
never see again in the world.

1146
01:21:05,626 --> 01:21:07,560
Thought is was once in a lifetime.

1147
01:21:15,836 --> 01:21:17,497
I had no reason to stay
on that wire any more...

1148
01:21:17,638 --> 01:21:22,041
and also I felt, huh.. the humidity
in the air and the wind growing.

1149
01:21:23,944 --> 01:21:25,377
My friends later told me,

1150
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,242
' You spent forty-five minutes'.

1151
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:29,349
They said, 'you know
you did eight crossings?'

1152
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:35,383
They grabbed me and they grounded me,

1153
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:37,582
hand cuffed, actually,
hands in the back.

1154
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:39,056
I was thrown down the staircase...

1155
01:21:39,193 --> 01:21:40,922
the most dangerous part of
this whole adventure,

1156
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:44,087
I almost break my head on
a narrow staircase

1157
01:21:44,231 --> 01:21:45,664
that lead to the elevator.

1158
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,531
Well, we got it
from the Port Authority,

1159
01:21:47,668 --> 01:21:49,568
that they took about three days
to rig it up.

1160
01:21:51,138 --> 01:21:53,402
I'd say it's about
a thousand dollars worth of cable.

1161
01:21:54,642 --> 01:21:57,634
...and the rigging outfit itself,
it's magnificent the way he did it.

1162
01:21:57,778 --> 01:21:59,439
Did he say anything about
why he was doing it?

1163
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,012
No.

1164
01:22:00,147 --> 01:22:01,273
Why did you do it?

1165
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,744
I will...I will explain.
I haven't got the time, this sec.

1166
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:06,577
You know? Why? Why?
...and that was a very...

1167
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,278
again, in my way of seeing America

1168
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:10,219
...a very American
finger-snapping question.

1169
01:22:10,357 --> 01:22:12,518
I did something magnificent

1170
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,151
and mysterious
and I got a practical, 'why?'

1171
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:18,493
...and the beauty of it is,
that I didn't have any 'why'.

1172
01:22:18,632 --> 01:22:19,758
Why did you do this?

1173
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:23,367
Oh, that's the thousand 'why',
in this morning. There is no 'why'.

1174
01:22:27,975 --> 01:22:32,912
I was then taken for a psychiatric
examination by a psychiatrist.

1175
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:39,010
It was a sort of big scientific area

1176
01:22:39,153 --> 01:22:40,780
Where the lunatics
were circulating around

1177
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:47,594
And it was, it is always the same,
that is we were amongst real psychotics

1178
01:22:48,429 --> 01:22:50,454
And we were not crazy. We were stars.

1179
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,156
I keep asking for water...

1180
01:22:52,299 --> 01:22:56,099
I was so dehydrated and he said,
'When was the last time you drank?'

1181
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:57,966
...and I say, 'are you crazy?
You're mad?'

1182
01:22:58,105 --> 01:22:59,129
I mean, do you know what I did?

1183
01:22:59,273 --> 01:23:00,797
I danced at the top of the world....

1184
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:02,408
...I am in the front page of
all the world....

1185
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:04,374
...Three hundred journalists
are waiting to talk to me

1186
01:23:04,511 --> 01:23:06,411
and you're asking me when was
the last time I..I drunk?

1187
01:23:06,547 --> 01:23:07,605
You're completely mad.'

1188
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:08,680
So, he wrote, you know,

1189
01:23:08,816 --> 01:23:11,250
'the guy is completely normal
and he's just very thirsty'.

1190
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:13,751
The police took
a humourless view of the act.

1191
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:16,717
They took Petit and a companion
into custody...

1192
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,791
and finally decided to charge them with.

1193
01:23:18,926 --> 01:23:20,917
'trespassing and disorderly conduct'.

1194
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:24,394
The District Attorney offered me
a deal...

1195
01:23:24,531 --> 01:23:27,728
...and he said 'Philippe,
if you agree to do a little show,

1196
01:23:27,868 --> 01:23:29,460
...but, you know,
like juggling three oranges...

1197
01:23:29,603 --> 01:23:32,197
in front of four kids but on camera,

1198
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:36,105
...The New York News and all that...
then...then we'll drop all the charges.'

1199
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:36,937
So, I say, ' Sure'.

1200
01:23:49,156 --> 01:23:53,183
And now I climb down the steps
of the Palais De Justice.

1201
01:23:53,327 --> 01:23:55,557
I saw in the crowd, an admirer.

1202
01:23:55,696 --> 01:23:58,494
She was smiling beautifully
and she came to me...

1203
01:23:58,632 --> 01:24:02,329
...and she put her hands on my neck
in a loving way

1204
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:04,061
and she amorously said,...

1205
01:24:04,204 --> 01:24:07,935
...'Philippe, I would like to be
the first new person to...

1206
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:12,307
...to welcome you and to, you know,
to celebrate with you and....

1207
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:15,472
...let's go...
I can follow you anywhere.'

1208
01:24:19,553 --> 01:24:23,182
So, yes, it did end up on a...
on a water bed in a loft somewhere.

1209
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:27,351
...but here I went for a very short,
little moment of...

1210
01:24:27,494 --> 01:24:30,088
...of...of...of I don't know... of...

1211
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:32,698
of pleasure of the flesh,
how disgusting....

1212
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:35,859
...but...but...but I am sorry,
how beautiful too.

1213
01:24:36,937 --> 01:24:38,598
I mean, my friends
were waiting for me.

1214
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:41,640
Annie, my girlfriend.
It was a betrayal of my friends.

1215
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,072
I remember, I call and say,

1216
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:46,008
'Well, no, I have many interview
to do so I'll see you soon.'

1217
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:52,515
I had this magnificent explosion
of pleasure, let's say it...

1218
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:55,781
...and then I went back,
oh... frightened to death.

1219
01:24:55,923 --> 01:24:57,686
You know, to my friends,
thinking I'm really...

1220
01:24:57,825 --> 01:24:59,053
I'm really, I'm really a guilty guy.

1221
01:24:59,193 --> 01:25:03,823
I saw Philippe discover what fame was.

1222
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:09,064
To be recognised, to be recognized
with expressions of friendliness,

1223
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:10,670
expressions of enthusiasm.

1224
01:25:10,804 --> 01:25:12,635
People would cross the street
to tell him

1225
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:14,934
'oh you gave us such a gift!'

1226
01:25:15,075 --> 01:25:16,440
It was so beautiful!

1227
01:25:16,577 --> 01:25:18,841
It was a breath of fresh air.
Thank you!'

1228
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,913
It was extraordinary and I think

1229
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:26,076
in Philippe's mind many things
were changing.

1230
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:29,650
I am a celebrity in New York.

1231
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:33,453
People say, ' Are you the guy
who walked between the Twin Towers?'

1232
01:25:33,594 --> 01:25:36,154
I say, ' Yeah, yeah, it's me'....
this is incredible.

1233
01:25:36,296 --> 01:25:37,092
And then some people say,

1234
01:25:37,231 --> 01:25:38,562
'Are you the guy who?' I say,'
Yeah, yeah, yeah.'

1235
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:39,631
...and then people say,
'Are you the guy?'

1236
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:40,756
I say ' Yeah, Yeah, it's me.'

1237
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:44,027
So the judge's sentence was
I thought pretty harsh,

1238
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:48,073
I was expelled from the united states.
I was condemned to expulsion.

1239
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:53,176
We talked about it in the plane.

1240
01:25:53,313 --> 01:25:57,511
Jean-Francois, he's so happy. He said,
' Well, I'm ready for the next time.'

1241
01:25:57,651 --> 01:26:00,814
I said, ' No, there will...
there will not be any more...

1242
01:26:01,688 --> 01:26:03,315
any more story like that'.

1243
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:09,289
There was something broken, probably,
in...in this friendship.

1244
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:13,226
Doesn't matter, because...

1245
01:26:14,968 --> 01:26:17,960
...well basically,
because we did it and .....

1246
01:26:18,105 --> 01:26:19,367
basically...

1247
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:28,147
I mean you cannot take away
what happened and....

1248
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,441
...yeah, what happened is that....

1249
01:26:49,236 --> 01:26:50,703
There was a love story.

1250
01:26:51,872 --> 01:26:55,399
It was obvious that for Philippe

1251
01:26:55,542 --> 01:26:59,205
an incredible stage of
his life was over.

1252
01:27:00,414 --> 01:27:03,906
And he was starting something else,
an other life.

1253
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:09,253
And strangely, so did I.

1254
01:27:11,959 --> 01:27:15,053
Our adventure had come to an end

1255
01:27:15,295 --> 01:27:16,523
And it was beautiful like that.

1256
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:01,500
To me, it's...it's really....
it's so simple....

1257
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:05,610
that life should be lived on...
on the edge of life.

1258
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:07,970
You have to exercise rebellion.

1259
01:28:10,784 --> 01:28:14,447
To refuse to...
taper yourself to rules.

1260
01:28:14,588 --> 01:28:16,419
To refuse your own success.

1261
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:18,548
To refuse to repeat yourself,

1262
01:28:18,692 --> 01:28:20,990
to see every day, every year,
every...

1263
01:28:21,128 --> 01:28:23,790
every idea as a...as a true challenge

1264
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:27,264
and then you are going to live
your life on a tight rope.
