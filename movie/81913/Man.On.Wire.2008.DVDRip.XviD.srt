1
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:06,278
Philippe

2
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:33,166
It was tense, but we were eager
to get going. Everything was ready.

3
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:29,688
Jean-Louis

4
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:39,870
I remember the extremely tense silence
in the van.

5
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,269
Alan was absolutely sombre,

6
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,371
Philippe extremely tense.

7
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,352
Annie
As for me I was petrified
very worried.

8
00:02:56,323 --> 00:03:00,191
I was disguised as a workman
with a helmet, a shirt...

9
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:03,390
Jean-François
To look like an American,
I had lot of pens in my pocket.

10
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,330
That's typically American, apparently.

11
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:22,009
David aka "Donald"

12
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:51,476
Alan aka "Alberf"

13
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,165
And Philippe said to me:
"I know what's going to happen...

14
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,467
...we are going to go in,
and we're going to get caught."

15
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:33,809
He could no longer carry on living
without having at least tried to...

16
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,921
...to conquer those towers

17
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,825
because it felt like those towers
belonged to him.

18
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,793
It was as if they had been built
especially for him.

19
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,781
I was twenty years old.

20
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:35,022
And I was
a painfully shy young girl.

21
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,823
I was very surprised
by this individual.

22
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:49,301
and even more surprised
when he began to chase me relentlessly,

23
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,641
having just met me.

24
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:57,308
He would bring me flowers,
arrange little dates,

25
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,046
send me love letters.

26
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:04,086
I was completely overwhelmed,

27
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:08,389
bowled over, harpooned,
that's what it was.

28
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:16,457
He introduced me to his wire.

29
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,164
a wire set up at the end of a garden.

30
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,238
I would spend hours watching him walk.

31
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,105
He wasn't that experienced at the time.

32
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,305
He was just beginning his life
as a tightrope walker.

33
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,483
We became inseparable.

34
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,925
In fact my life
was completely consumed by his.

35
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,761
And he never thought to ask me whether
I had my own destiny to follow.

36
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,130
It was quite clear
I had to follow his.

37
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:05,239
Jean-Louis
Childhood friend

38
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,884
Jean-Louis had told me right away
that it was illegal.

39
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,452
Jean-François
Accomplice

40
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:26,795
So I knew it was illegal, but of course
that's what got me a bit excited!

41
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:31,729
Against the law,
but not wicked or mean.

42
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,363
It was wonderful!

43
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:37,365
Notre Dame Cathedral
Paris, June 197 1

44
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,335
Then Philippe appeared on the wire.

45
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,307
It was amazing.

46
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,384
I went inside, all excited,

47
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:25,881
and I leant over the nave
and saw that a huge ceremony

48
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,654
was taking place in Notre Dame.

49
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:36,466
There were a dozen or so priests
dressed all in white, arm crossed.

50
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:39,938
They were lying on the floor,
their heads against the floor.

51
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,037
I was staggered, dumbstruck.

52
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:49,169
The organist asked me:
"What are you doing here?"

53
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,548
I said to him: "There's a wirewalker
up there on the towers!"

54
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,987
This gentleman looked at me
with an expression of wonder.

55
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,853
and he said;
"Oh, really! A wirewalker!

56
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,824
How amazing!"

57
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:43,459
South Tower 3.58pm

58
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,838
We drove the van inside.

59
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,707
We got through
the first security barrier.

60
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:56,743
We presented the company documents
and the fake invoices.

61
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,250
Everything
was quite carefully planned.

62
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:24,137
North Tower 4.25pm

63
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:45,164
The time had come for us to part.

64
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,898
There was a real madness
in his eyes, a real rage.

65
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:56,473
It was truly: " I'm going to do this,
no matter what, now is the time" .

66
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:01,907
And he held me in his arms as if
we would never see each other again.

67
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:17,024
Sydney, Australia
June 1973

68
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:46,278
Mark
"The Australian"

69
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:21,931
One day he showed me a photo
of two buildings in a magazine.

70
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,310
And then I was a bit frightened.

71
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:32,715
It was inhuman to want to go
and walk up there, 450 meters high.

72
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:36,651
This was all becoming demonic.
I just wanted to say: "Stop!"

73
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:41,784
Barry Greenhouse
"The Inside Man"

74
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:49,796
South Tower 4.27 pm

75
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:11,142
This beam was over the elevator shaft
that had a drop of 400 meters.

76
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:07,525
North Tower 6.22pm

77
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:10,337
South Tower 7.44pm

78
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,126
Jim Moore

79
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:03,159
A minute ago you said the whole place
was swarming with cops.

80
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:05,999
This is what they'll make you do
when you're prison.

81
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:09,439
They'll make you clean the windows
in all the tall towers.

82
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:44,813
South Tower 8. 10pm

83
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:36,705
His foot was up my nose

84
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,936
and my foot was stuck
between his arms,

85
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:40,569
we were completely entwined.

86
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:44,479
I guess you could say
we really got to know each other.

87
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:47,178
I've rarely known a man
that way before!

88
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:56,592
North Tower 9.38pm

89
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:46,470
Mark
"The Australian"

90
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,569
He wanted to set up a wire

91
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:53,543
to correspond exactly to the
distance between the two towers.

92
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:56,936
And to practice on it
a much as he could.

93
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:22,706
Someone had spoken to him
about the elasticity of the building

94
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:27,841
and the fact that the wind could cause
the towers to sway.

95
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,405
So there was a moment
of great concern.

96
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:41,998
There was always and still is, this
'bad boy' side to Philippe's character.

97
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:45,567
He had a very strict upbringing.

98
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:49,670
And he would never have strayed
too far down that illegal road.

99
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:57,805
But he got great pleasure
from taking certain 'liberties'.

100
00:43:58,015 --> 00:44:01,746
He's so excessive, so creative,

101
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:05,017
so each day
is like a work of art for him.

102
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:26,375
What excited him most
about this adventure

103
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,709
aside from being a beautiful show

104
00:44:29,747 --> 00:44:32,648
was that it was like
a bank robbery.

105
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,708
And that pleased him enormously.

106
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:17,787
Gradually things began
to get more serious

107
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:20,422
because a proper plan
had to be worked out.

108
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,796
And then the arguments
between Jean-Louis and Philippe

109
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,232
really got started.

110
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,952
Ok, so we get through the main gate,
however we decide to do it.

111
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:58,799
The trick is going to be on the top
floor, coming out of the elevator.

112
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,236
It is better to be dressed
as office workers.

113
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:03,206
- No! As workers...
- Wait! Let me finish!

114
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,674
It was almost impossible
to imagine them

115
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,472
getting into the tower undetected.

116
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:10,241
They didn't even know
how they were going to get in.

117
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,715
And I think right from the start,

118
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,718
Jean-Louis felt
an enormous responsibility.

119
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:19,985
And he wouldn't let Philippe
have it his way,

120
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:22,857
perhaps because he felt
that Philippe wasn't being realistic.

121
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:27,963
No! We're being complete idiots.

122
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:31,427
Jean-Louis knew I sided with him

123
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:35,431
and Philippe also knew
I was taking Jean-Louis' side.

124
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:06,402
May 13th 197 4

125
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:55,818
Guy Tozzoli
President WTC Association

126
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:33,539
May 28th 197 4

127
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:32,357
The first attempt had failed.

128
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:35,721
He called me and asked me
to come over immediately.

129
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:40,703
Of course my role was
to support and encourage him.

130
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:50,847
It was always a matter
of trying to understand

131
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,179
what was going on in his head
and of encouraging him.

132
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:56,208
That was my job
and it was really exhausting.

133
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:04,721
He would spend the night
watching television.

134
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:08,720
He only ever watched
detective movies, bank robberies,

135
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:11,859
stories about cops and robbers.

136
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:16,403
I'm convinced he was getting
in shape with this.

137
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:21,808
He was looking for the strength,

138
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:24,507
so he could break into these towers.

139
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:28,783
So he went back, again and again,

140
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:31,913
to the World Trade Center,
to the main entrance hall.

141
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:33,923
And Philippe observed very carefully

142
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:40,055
how people went in,
showing their passes, etc.

143
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:04,346
David aka "Donald"
Rock Singer

144
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:37,001
Alan aka "Albert"
Quality Guy

145
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,681
I was really very worried.

146
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:24,085
The team included people
who were totally unreliable.

147
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:42,665
Jean-Louis reminded me
about Notre Dame,

148
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:44,640
said it would be
the same kind of thing,

149
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:48,474
the same adventure, but this time
in New York at the World Trade Center.

150
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:51,036
He didn't tell me much more,

151
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:53,174
just asked whether
I wanted to come or not.

152
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:11,864
When we arrived in New York
on the Boston train,

153
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,803
at one point we went past
the Empire State Building.

154
00:58:15,238 --> 00:58:18,401
At that moment I looked up,

155
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:20,875
I saw the height
of the Empire State Building

156
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:23,141
and I was horrified.

157
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,638
My legs started to shake,
it was terrifying!

158
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:29,581
Especially when I realised the World
Trade Center was even higher.

159
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:33,350
I kept it all to myself,
but I was terrified.

160
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:53,037
When Jean-Louis came back,
the tension rose enormously.

161
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:55,670
It became unbearable.

162
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:57,873
The problem was the team.

163
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:34,446
The very night before the coup,
they arrived at the apartment

164
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:37,317
in a deplorable state.

165
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:39,083
One of them was stoned.

166
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:43,582
He was completely gone,
lost in a haze of smoke.

167
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:47,996
Jean-Louis was absolutely dismayed.
So was Philippe.

168
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:42,385
1 1.08pm, August 6th

169
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,581
There was someone there
that we hadn't expected,

170
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:22,585
sitting at a desk with a little light.

171
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:03,925
I remember the vastness of New York!
The altitude!

172
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:10,923
The Statue of Liberty, the UN building,
all looking so tiny.

173
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:13,193
It was magnificent.

174
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:16,296
And the sounds as well,
the police sirens all night long.

175
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,965
It was all so alive!

176
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:20,566
And we were kings!

177
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:07,311
4.48am, August 7th

178
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:17,208
The streets were deserted.

179
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:20,754
I found a taxi willing to take me there.

180
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:25,516
So I waited with the others.

181
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,223
Other members of the team joined us.

182
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:36,167
And our eyes were absolutely glued
to the towers.

183
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:38,673
I was looking out
for the slightest movement,

184
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,335
but we couldn't see a thing.

185
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:45,540
It was absolutely terrifying.

186
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:00,783
Suddenly we saw something,
a shape,

187
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:02,950
just for a second, falling down.

188
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:24,606
There was a huge cry of relief...

189
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:26,774
it was only a piece of clothing.

190
01:13:26,816 --> 01:13:30,217
We all thought: " He must have just
dropped something, that's ok."

191
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:40,416
We all thought: "Of course
it's possible he could fall."

192
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:43,581
We all thought it,
but we didn't believe it.

193
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:46,017
We thought it,
but we didn't believe it.

194
01:16:53,055 --> 01:16:54,488
I saw Philippe.

195
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:57,219
I saw Philippe up there,
it was extraordinary.

196
01:16:57,259 --> 01:16:59,625
It was so, so beautiful.

197
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:06,326
It was like he was walking
on a cloud.

198
01:17:09,905 --> 01:17:11,031
And there were
such amazing moments.

199
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:12,131
When he lay down...

200
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:18,807
...we were thrilled by this image
of Philippe lying down up above.

201
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:29,854
And another very powerful moment
was when he...

202
01:17:33,462 --> 01:17:35,794
It was so beautiful.

203
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:40,399
When he knelt down.

204
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:44,873
There was a moment
when he knelt down and saluted.

205
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:54,543
I cried out: " Look! Look!"

206
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:58,519
People started gathering,
but they couldn't see.

207
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:00,749
They asked me:
"What is it? What do you see?"

208
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:05,192
I said: " Look, a wirewalker!
He's walking!"

209
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,991
Philippe did provoke them,
naturally,

210
01:19:50,032 --> 01:19:54,059
because that's what
he does, that's his character!

211
01:19:54,236 --> 01:19:57,330
He would come close
to the guards or the police,

212
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,272
who were trying to grab him,

213
01:19:59,308 --> 01:20:03,005
then he would turn around
and be out of their reach,

214
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:05,878
because they weren't about
to get on the wire!

215
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:39,860
The place was
a sort of scientific area

216
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:41,892
where lunatics walk round in circles.

217
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:47,837
So here we were,
surrounded by mad people.

218
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:50,567
But we weren't mad,
we were stars!

219
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:03,741
I saw Philippe discover
what it meant to be famous,

220
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:10,412
to be recognized, with expressions
of friendliness and enthusiasm.

221
01:25:10,452 --> 01:25:14,616
People would cross the street
to tell him: "You gave us such a gift!"

222
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:16,590
" It was so beautiful!

223
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,593
It was a breath of fresh air...
thank you!"

224
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:23,988
It was extraordinary
and I think in Philippe's mind,

225
01:25:24,032 --> 01:25:26,159
many things were changing.

226
01:25:40,582 --> 01:25:44,177
So the judge's sentence
was pretty harsh, I thought.

227
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:47,985
I was expelled from the United States.

228
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:51,317
There was a love story.

229
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,087
But it was clear...

230
01:26:54,389 --> 01:26:59,122
...that Philippe had gone through
an incredible moment in his life

231
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:03,488
and he was starting
something else, a new life.

232
01:27:06,902 --> 01:27:09,735
Strangely, I felt the same way.

233
01:27:11,806 --> 01:27:15,173
Our relationship
was meant to end here

234
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,440
and it was beautiful that way.

235
01:33:49,337 --> 01:33:52,568
