1
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:47,422
In the middle of the night,
I have almost a nightmare.

2
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:53,052
I wake up and I had forgotten
to nail shut the crate.

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,221
So I go there, and
though it was raining...

4
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,267
...I must have waked up the
whole neighbourhood, you know...

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,353
...was not closing the box,
it was nailing the coffin.

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,231
I am nailing the
coffin. I see it as that.

7
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,151
Why, why this expression?
Why this thought?

8
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:13,698
Well, maybe death is now looking through
the golden frame of this dream,...

9
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,784
...and now reality is
going to choke me to death.

10
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,371
Does it make any sense to conduct
surveillance when somebody knows about it?

11
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,083
Now, I am Tuesday the 6th of August.

12
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,545
The surveillance involved,
not what he was looking for...

13
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:33,166
It was tense, but we were eager
to get going. Everything was ready.

14
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:39,098
<i>...maintain surveillance, they
did so for security reasons,...</i>

15
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,309
<i>...and I will not go beyond that.</i>

16
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>I have never obstructed justice,...</i>

17
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:50,485
<i>...and, I think, too, that I could
say that in my years of public life...</i>

18
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,737
<i>...that I welcome this
kind of examination,...</i>

19
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,365
<i>...because people have gotta know
whether or not their Presidents a crook.</i>

20
00:01:56,492 --> 00:02:01,621
<i>Well, I am not a crook. I have
earned everything I have got.</i>

21
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,422
Everybody was getting
more and more nervous.

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,510
And finally, we were all
ready and said, "OK, lets go. "

23
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,678
So we jump in the truck...

24
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:29,857
Were not going to die,
were going to live.

25
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:39,870
I remember the extremely
tense silence in the van.

26
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,269
Alan was absolutely sombre,...

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,371
...Philippe extremely tense.

28
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,352
Annie As for me I was
petrified very worried.

29
00:02:56,323 --> 00:03:00,191
I was disguised as a workman
with a helmet, a shirt...

30
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:03,390
Jean-Francois To look like an American,
I had lot of pens in my pocket.

31
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,330
Thats typically American, apparently.

32
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,609
I was gonna be on the
crew in the South Tower.

33
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:19,740
We were gonna go at closing time with
a big hamper, with all the gear in it.

34
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,243
There were gonna be some
guys in the North Tower,...

35
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,330
...dressed for business
with much less gear,...

36
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,751
...an architects tube... and I
believe that was holding the bow.

37
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,379
Electricity in the air
between Jean-Louis and Albert.

38
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,757
I can read it in Jean-Louis
face, he doesnt trust Albert.

39
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,760
I had a bad feeling, er, there
is something wrong with this guy.

40
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,514
He is not at all on the
same... track that we are.

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,601
Fear was in the air.

42
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:50,229
I assumed that even in the
best possible situation...

43
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,356
...that we were all
going to be arrested.

44
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,567
There was no doubt of that.

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,989
I cant imagine how they
didn't feel the same way.

46
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:07,246
I felt that the horizontality of driving
through the streets of Manhattan...

47
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,623
...suddenly became slant.

48
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,793
I was on the ramp. I was
being engulfed by the monster.

49
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,165
And Philippe said to me: "I
know whats going to happen...

50
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,467
...we are going to go in, and
were going to get caught. "

51
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,766
It was suddenly not a dream
any more. It was tangible.

52
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:33,809
He could no longer carry on living
without having at least tried to...

53
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,921
...to conquer those towers

54
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,825
because it felt like those
towers belonged to him.

55
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,793
It was as if they had been
built especially for him.

56
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,851
"Once upon a time... "

57
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:57,815
Now, thats how you start fairytales,
and actually my story is a fairytale.

58
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,948
Here I am, young, 17 years
old, with a bad tooth,...

59
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,578
...in one of those uncolourful
waiting rooms of a French dentist,...

60
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,372
...and its really lit
with a little 40-watt bulb.

61
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,750
And you have old ladies
and people, you know,...

62
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,004
...sheepishly looking at magazines,
its quiet, and suddenly I freeze.

63
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,549
Because I have opened
a newspaper at a page...

64
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,551
...and I see something magnificent,

65
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,846
something that inspires
me, I see two towers.

66
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,016
And the article says, "One day
those towers will be built. "

67
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,768
They're not even there yet.

68
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:38,272
And when they are, they will
become the highest in the world.

69
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,693
Now, I need to have that, this
little tangible start of my dream,...

70
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,696
...but everybody is watching
and... but I need that page.

71
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,657
So what I do is, under the
cover of sneeze... Aaah!

72
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:52,703
I tear the page, put it
under my jacket and go out.

73
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,831
Now, of course, I would have
a toothache for a week,...

74
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,669
...but whats the pain, in comparison
that now I have acquired my dream?

75
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,008
Usually, when you have a dream, the
object of your dream is tangible.

76
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,636
Its there. Its... its quixotic,...

77
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,431
...but its there, nagging
you, you know, confronting you.

78
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,934
But the object of my
dream doesnt exist yet.

79
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:29,781
I was twenty years old.

80
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:35,022
And I was a painfully shy young girl.

81
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,823
I was very surprised
by this individual...

82
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:49,301
...and even more surprised when he
began to chase me relentlessly,...

83
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,641
...having just met me.

84
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:57,308
He would bring me flowers,
arrange little dates,...

85
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,046
...send me love letters.

86
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:04,086
I was completely overwhelmed,...

87
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:08,389
...bowled over, harpooned,
that's what it was.

88
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:16,457
He introduced me to his wire.

89
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,164
A wire set up at the end of a garden.

90
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,238
I would spend hours watching him walk.

91
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,105
He wasn't that experienced at the time.

92
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,305
He was just beginning his
life as a tightrope walker.

93
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,483
We became inseparable.

94
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,925
In fact my life was
completely consumed by his.

95
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,761
And he never thought to ask me
whether I had my own destiny to follow.

96
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,130
It was quite clear I had to follow his.

97
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,978
Annie, who knows me
better than everybody,...

98
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,232
...Annie, who was at my side
during my discovery of the wire,...

99
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,902
...whose large, green eyes move me.

100
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,948
When we embrace, we
look like two kids...

101
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,951
...plotting our next piece of mischief.

102
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:31,088
I started as a young,
self-taught wirewalker,

103
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:36,010
To dream of... not so much
conquering the universe,...

104
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:40,139
...but as a poet
conquering beautiful stages.

105
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,235
One day he said,...

106
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,989
"I really would like to
put a wire on Notre Dame. "

107
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:03,203
At first I thought it was a joke,
but in the meantime, I knew...

108
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,957
I knew that there was something
a little bit real about it,...

109
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,878
...and then we started to
talk more and more about it.

110
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,881
And then we started to plan it.

111
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,546
It took about a year to
find the right way to do it.

112
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,884
Jean-Louis had told me right
away that it was illegal.

113
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,452
Jean-Francois Accomplice

114
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:26,795
So I knew it was illegal, but of
course that's what got me a bit excited!

115
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:31,729
Against the law, but not wicked or mean.

116
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:33,363
It was wonderful!

117
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,365
Notre Dame Cathedral Paris, June 1971

118
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,197
Can you imagine, you wake up
in the morning in the city...

119
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:43,285
...and all of a sudden you see a
high-wirewalker between... Notre Dame?

120
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,204
Its a dream.

121
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,627
Thats what really attracts me.

122
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,631
Its the challenge of doing something
thats supposed to be impossible.

123
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,134
And, in the meantime, doing
something thats so beautiful...

124
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,138
...that not only doesnt hurt anybody,
but gives something to somebody.

125
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,335
Then Philippe appeared on the wire.

126
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,307
It was amazing.

127
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,384
I went inside, all excited,...

128
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:25,881
...and I leant over the nave
and saw that a huge ceremony

129
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,654
was taking place in Notre Dame.

130
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:36,466
There were a dozen or so priests
dressed all in white, arm crossed.

131
00:12:36,502 --> 00:12:39,938
They were lying on the floor,
their heads against the floor.

132
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,037
I was staggered, dumbstruck.

133
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:49,169
The organist asked me:
"What are you doing here?"

134
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:52,548
I said to him: "There's a
wirewalker up there on the towers!"

135
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,987
This gentleman looked at me
with an expression of wonder...

136
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,853
...and he said; "Oh,
really! A wirewalker!

137
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,824
How amazing!"

138
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:43,459
South Tower 3.58pm

139
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,838
We drove the van inside.

140
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,707
We got through the
first security barrier.

141
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:56,743
We presented the company
documents and the fake invoices.

142
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,250
Everything was quite carefully planned.

143
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,174
And now we were horizontal again,...

144
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,136
...we were driving in the
subterranean garage of the two towers.

145
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,264
And we were going. I
knew the plan. Ha ha!

146
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:15,354
We were going to the freight
elevator of the South Tower.

147
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,607
It was... the whole
plan was in the making.

148
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:24,137
North Tower 4.25pm

149
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,199
The basic plan was very simple.

150
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:33,622
We had ID cards, so it was just a matter
of kind of pushing our way through.

151
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,919
Once wed gotten in the buildings...
it was pretty smooth sailing.

152
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:45,164
The time had come for us to part.

153
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,898
There was a real madness
in his eyes, a real rage.

154
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:56,473
It was truly: " I'm going to do this,
no matter what, now is the time".

155
00:14:57,243 --> 00:15:01,907
And he held me in his arms as if
we would never see each other again.

156
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,571
If I die, what a beautiful death.

157
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,366
To die in the... in the
exercise of your passion.

158
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:17,024
Sydney, Australia June 1973

159
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,626
We broke into the Sydney Harbour
Bridge pylon one night,...

160
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,545
...carried all this equipment
in, put a tightrope up,...

161
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,715
...disappeared in the morning
and then sat down on the street

162
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,635
...and watched Philippe
walk backwards and forwards.

163
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:15,659
The fact that the wirewalking
activity is framed by death,...

164
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,788
...its great because then you
have to take it very seriously.

165
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:24,376
Its a little half a
millimetre of mistake...

166
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,838
...or a quarter of a second of
inattention, and you lose your life.

167
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,652
This is the Sydney Harbour Bridge
and the traffic was backed up.

168
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,946
The police came, of
course, within minutes.

169
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,509
When he was taken away,...

170
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,847
...the first thing he did was
he picked the policemans watch.

171
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:23,059
Philippe manages to take the
guys watch off his wrist...

172
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,771
...and hide it in his pocket!

173
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,041
These Twin Towers are
trotting in my head.

174
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,085
You know, Im galloping in my brain.

175
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,761
As Im back to Paris, slap in the face.

176
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:02,057
"Paris Match", double page,
"The Twin Towers are built. "

177
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,646
But right now the picture tells me
that those beams are not still covered.

178
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,773
The things are not
painted. I see workers.

179
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,693
I imagine maybe for a few more
months, or a year, who knows?

180
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,287
Its in construction and I can sneak in.

181
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:21,931
One day he showed me a photo
of two buildings in a magazine.

182
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,310
And then I was a bit frightened.

183
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:32,715
It was inhuman to want to go and
walk up there, 450 meters high.

184
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:36,651
This was all becoming demonic.
I just wanted to say: "Stop!"

185
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:41,784
Barry Greenhouse "The Inside Man"

186
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:49,688
The plan was for me to bring all
my equipment to the 82nd floor,...

187
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,690
...which was Barrys hiding place.

188
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,276
There was one in each
tower, the same floor.

189
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,404
And to put all the equipment there,
using the freight elevator,...

190
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,824
...saying, "Delivery for 82nd floor. "
And Barry will be there to receive, OK.

191
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,412
At the time, I was an Assistant
Director of Research...

192
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,747
...at The New York State
Insurance Department.

193
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,709
Wed just moved in, and
I was on what was then...

194
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,546
...the highest occupied floor
in Two World Trade Center.

195
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,640
I knew there was gonna
be a team in each tower...

196
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,435
...and that the stuff was
gonna be delivered to me.

197
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,397
Then it was gonna be carried
up... wouldve been 28 floors.

198
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:37,527
The operator of the freight elevator
had not completely heard the foreman...

199
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,654
...shouting, "82nd floor!"

200
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,450
And it was clearly on our delivery
bill and on all the package.

201
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,911
He asked to the group,
"What floor again?"

202
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:50,373
Right there, I think, this is
it, and I said clearly, "104!"

203
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:56,880
"OK, whatever. Watch your hands,"
and cling, the gate clanked shut.

204
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,056
Now we are in a plywood box, in
a temporary freight elevator,...

205
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,058
...going all the way up,...

206
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:12,479
...and its dark, its a...
its a travel towards heaven.

207
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,898
And the darkness becomes grey,...

208
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,068
...and I see a square of
grey that becomes lighter.

209
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,112
I see a square of light. It is the sky.

210
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:27,994
Were getting there and were arriving
just a few floors below the roof...

211
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,663
...with all our equipment.

212
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,542
Annie came to my office and
told me that they had,...

213
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,587
...by a great stroke of fortune,...

214
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,757
...gotten on the freight elevator

215
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:46,554
and saved themselves 20 floors
of carrying up all that equipment.

216
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,975
Now, I find myself in
a deserted floor, 104,...

217
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:55,188
...and the first thing we do is
unpack and take equipment out.

218
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,109
Suddenly, I hear a guard coming.

219
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,529
I just look and I see over there a tarp.

220
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,740
So I just grab Jean-François
and I throw him underneath,...

221
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,667
...and I hear
Jean-François yell, "Argh!"

222
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:11,142
This beam was over the elevator
shaft that had a drop of 400 meters.

223
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,712
"What? Were going under it?"
Yeah, we had to hide under a tarp.

224
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,798
Donald starts saying, "Hold on my
leg, hold on this, where can I go?"

225
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,843
And I kind of like... right
on the spur of the moment said,

226
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,179
"You know what, man? I cant do this. "

227
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,976
And hes like, "OK, go ahead. "

228
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,856
"Go quick!" I think, who was the more
happy, Donald or I? Anyway, bye-bye, Donald!

229
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,191
Unbridled glee.

230
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,778
Im so happy to not have to do this.

231
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,073
Im running down the stairs, 110 flights.

232
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,618
Its like those dreams
where you never touch down.

233
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,954
Itwas so beautiful.

234
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,964
So here we are under the
tarp, frozen to death.

235
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,468
I dont have to mumble to
Jean-François, "Dont move. "

236
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,221
He feels it in our body... connection.

237
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,642
And now the guard comes. Has he seen us?

238
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:21,566
Has he heard us? Has
he seen the tarp move?

239
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:25,236
But the guard comes and leans
against the structure,...

240
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,157
...and he seems to be a foot away.

241
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:33,620
I hear the cracking of his walkie-talkie,
and I hear he takes a cigarette.

242
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,123
The sound close-up now of the
lighter and of his first puff,...

243
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,002
...the burning of the extremity
of the cigarette and the...

244
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,255
He seems to be almost leaning on my ear.

245
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,217
So, we are, I mean,
frozen. We dont breathe.

246
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,312
We wait for 6, 6:30.

247
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,776
So we start to climb.

248
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,949
We saw nobody in the stairway,
nobody underneath the roof.

249
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,243
Seems pretty safe.

250
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,891
All of a sudden, we hear
somebody coming from the stairway.

251
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,602
So, we are scared like hell.

252
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,606
So we run to the hiding place
and we jump in the hiding place.

253
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:47,569
We hear some steps. We hear
the walkie-talkie noise.

254
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,621
And the noises were very confusing.

255
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,292
Sometimes, you dont hear
the guy for 10 minutes.

256
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:06,004
So, you think hes gone.
All of a sudden you hear...

257
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,965
You hear him coughing or you
hear a talkie-walkie noise,...

258
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:14,971
...like hes right next to the
hiding place, so we could not talk.

259
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:23,938
We started to write little notes.

260
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:29,152
We kept saying, "Do you think
now Yeah? Lets wait longer. "

261
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,738
It was uncomfortable, but... you know

262
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,990
Once you understand
you dont have a choice,

263
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,993
you try to settle in and just wait.

264
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,876
At that point, were in
suits. In business suits.

265
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,629
Being in a business suit
with heavy equipment,...

266
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,341
...hiding behind a pile of boxes,
I mean, there is no explanation.

267
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,385
If we were caught at
that time, that was it.

268
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:11,027
What if the guard is still
around, toying with us,

269
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:15,740
waiting for us to make the slightest
movement before he pounces on us?

270
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,368
We must wait.

271
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:23,081
To ease the torment, I
return to my memories.

272
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:28,169
The gold and mud, years of dreaming,...

273
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,422
...months of organising.

274
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,344
I dive back into the
past for a long while.

275
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:42,517
That it will indeed serve
the purposes intended

276
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:47,146
and that it will truly promote not
only harmony between the states,

277
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:53,194
but harmony and communication
between the nations of the world.

278
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,947
Itwas in January of 1974.

279
00:26:56,073 --> 00:27:01,369
I climbed on the roof of my little house
and screamed, "Im coming to America!"

280
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:22,390
And the minute I got out of the subway,
climbing the steps, looking at them,

281
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,726
I knew that they were no dream.

282
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:29,314
I knew that it was... My
dream was destroyed instantly.

283
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,405
Impossible. Impossible.
Impossible. Its clearly impossible.

284
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,450
Not only to walk across this high,
I probably hardly thought of it,

285
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,162
but to bring almost like a
ton of equipment secretly,

286
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,914
to rig a wire for
hours, to guy-line it,

287
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:51,252
its clearly out of human scale.

288
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:57,258
But something in me pulls
me toward touching it.

289
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:04,126
Jim Moore

290
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:10,146
Thats when he spoke to
me about his project.

291
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:15,526
He said, "Well, I want to string a wire
between the two World Trade Center Towers. "

292
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,946
I said, "OK, sounds wild. "

293
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:22,075
I mean, Id never met a
high-wirewalker before,

294
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:26,329
so I had no idea what... nor did I
even entertain the idea at the time

295
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:30,041
of what the consequences of
anything happening would be.

296
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,252
It just sounded like a really
fun adventure to get involved in.

297
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:37,632
So I took it upon myself to say,
"Sure, lets... lets work on it. "

298
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,635
The first occasion we
went up in the elevator,

299
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,929
we took the elevator to the 86th floor.

300
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,598
When we got off, there
was a guard there.

301
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:50,103
He said, "What are you doing here?"
So, obviously, we couldnt continue.

302
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,064
So we took the elevator
back down and then realised,

303
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,443
"Well, lets just walk up. "

304
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:02,156
Then we proceeded to climb
up the 110 flights to the top.

305
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:13,292
We are at the top of the world.

306
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:19,382
I see two slabs of concrete, barely
inhabited, with some construction.

307
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:24,011
No fence, no net, no nothing,
and... and I am frozen to death.

308
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,309
I see the other tower and
I... I imagine the void.

309
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,980
And if I were to run... on the slab,

310
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,400
I will just fall to another life.

311
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,704
And slowly I thought, "OK, its impossible.
Thats sure. So lets start working. "

312
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,039
We took pictures of all
these things, thinking,

313
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:58,337
"Perhaps thats where the cable might be
tied, or may be a cable we could use. "

314
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:03,426
He wasnt sure how he was gonna
rig it at that particular time.

315
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:08,097
I decided in the staircase
to draw a little fresco,...

316
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,186
...as if I needed some tangible proof...

317
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,355
...to show me that I was going
through different steps...

318
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:21,402
...and approaching the impossible of
actually finding myself on that wire.

319
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,495
I even rented a helicopter
at some point,...

320
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:34,499
...and Jim was with me taking pictures
of the roof, of the equipment there,...

321
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,168
...for making a model, for measuring.

322
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:42,590
But I also wanted a little
bit to see if it was possible.

323
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,512
He wanted to get higher than where he
was gonna be when he walked on the wire.

324
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:52,558
It was a way of tricking his
mind into not feeling fear

325
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,229
by being higher than where he was
gonna be when he actually did the walk.

326
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:01,192
One day I received a postcard with a "W
- World Trade Center".

327
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,403
I never heard about
the WTC at that time,

328
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,242
and he had drawn a little
wire on top of the towers.

329
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,329
I thought, "Of course, thats why
these towers are there: for Philippe!"

330
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,707
So, now I go back to France.

331
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,126
The minute I arrive,
I didnt even go home.

332
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:24,423
I run to Jean-Louis, my old friend,
and I said, "I have a new idea. "

333
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,261
This, we knew that
legally we could not do it.

334
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:32,056
I mean, nobody knew...
knew Philippe Petit.

335
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,141
Nobody knew us, you
go there and you ask,

336
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:38,354
"Can I put a wire on top of the World
Trade Center?" Theyd say, "Get out. "

337
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,568
So I tried to get
information from Philippe.

338
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:44,944
"So you have been there,

339
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,864
"you told me you have been ten times
on the top, but what did you get as...

340
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,866
"... what do we have as information?"

341
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,869
"But I have pictures, look,
and we can put the wire...

342
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,748
"... I dont know where to put it but
well find out with the pictures. "

343
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,001
This is the best.

344
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:03,159
A minute ago you said the whole
place was swarming with cops.

345
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:05,999
This is what they'll make
you do when you're prison.

346
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:09,439
They'll make you clean the
windows in all the tall towers.

347
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,599
I started to do... er... a
little recap in my head,...

348
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,976
...and I found out we had nothing.

349
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:21,772
Hes not driven by the impetuous
feeling of dancing between the towers.

350
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,943
He is driven by, "Im gonna help Philippe.
I dont want to help him to kill himself.

351
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,572
"I dont want to be caught there, and we
want to succeed, we dont want to fail. "

352
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,784
So for plenty of reasons that are
actually noble and understandable,

353
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,830
he becomes almost the...
We fight a lot on... on...

354
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:42,084
"You dont have enough elements,
Philippe, to build up a serious plan. "

355
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:47,173
So now I go back and this is
the second visit to America.

356
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,014
Now I spend my time
spying on the Twin Towers.

357
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,767
With all my might. I go day and night.

358
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:03,814
I note things and fill the exercise books
with all those notes and little doodlings,

359
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,612
...and I look at what commercial vehicles
go underneath for freight delivery.

360
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,658
I go in. I find a way at
lunch time to disguise myself.

361
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,163
The workers seem to
arrive in normal cars...

362
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:24,835
At some point, I am so much into
taking notes as a spy around the Towers,

363
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,962
I dont see its a construction site,

364
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:32,051
I dont see one nail
sticking out of one plank.

365
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:38,724
So, right there, the big nail goes
through my sole. Three days in bed.

366
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,270
So, here I am with crutches.
Thinking I am incapacitated.

367
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,856
No, no, no, no. Its the opposite.

368
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,944
Its wonderful, a human being with
crutches. The Universe is his!

369
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,948
The guards, you know, help me, "Can
I help you? Let me hold the door. "

370
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,159
People, you know, "Sit down, take
your time. " Nobody asks me for an ID,

371
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,955
...nobody says, "What are you doing
here?" I... I have this fabulous...

372
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,041
So then now, even though my
foot is about to be repaired,...

373
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,711
...I use the crutches a lot. OK?

374
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:10,131
And sometimes you would see the man
leaving his crutches and running around...

375
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:14,260
...to measure something and coming
back and being with crutches!

376
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,115
One time we went up there,
it was very, very windy,...

377
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:40,286
...and I... I actually wasnt
sure why we were going up there.

378
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,749
I barely had the courage to get
out of my little trap door,...

379
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,918
...and Jim, hanging on, I dont know how,

380
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,130
managed to take a picture
of me hanging on to a post...

381
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:55,134
...at the very roof of the tower,
with my body almost horizontally.

382
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,970
The wind was blowing me away.

383
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,055
- So, what if...?
- Very scary.

384
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:03,058
That was may be one of the first times
I realised how crazy it was up there...

385
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:07,021
...with that kind of condition and the
height and what we were involved in.

386
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,274
What happens if Im up there and
I rig it and something happens?

387
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,987
I started thinking about those things and
when we got closer to the actual event,

388
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,032
I basically said, "No, I
cant... I cant help you rig.

389
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,284
"I cant be part of that
team that goes to the top. "

390
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,813
South Tower 8. 10pm

391
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,849
Here we are,...

392
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,561
...underneath the top of the
World Trade Center, under a tarp.

393
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,983
Each time we would hear a noise,
it was very hard to tell...

394
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,236
...if it was a cardboard
board flapping in the wind...

395
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,363
...or a guard coming,
or a walkie-talkie.

396
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:08,040
I drilled a little hole with a paperclip,
and I enlarged this hole in the canvas

397
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,669
with a conical end of a ball-point pen.

398
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:20,135
And then with one eye I was able to
see a little bit of the ambient light...

399
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,221
...going onto the figure of my watch.

400
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,142
What time is it? Is it dark outside?

401
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:30,855
Oh, I heard noise, lets
try to go out of the tarp.

402
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:36,705
His foot was up my nose...

403
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,936
...and my foot was stuck
between his arms,...

404
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:40,569
...we were completely entwined.

405
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:44,479
I guess you could say we
really got to know each other.

406
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:47,178
I've rarely known a man that way before!

407
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:55,255
We kept hearing more and more noise from
the roof. Like voices, like machines.

408
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:56,292
North Tower 9.38pm

409
00:36:56,381 --> 00:37:00,050
Sometimes, far away.
Sometimes, very close.

410
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,387
But really like somebody
was walking on the roof.

411
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,931
Gee, if they are working at night,...

412
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,227
...we are stuck, I mean, there
is no chance the coup will happen.

413
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,898
The longer we waited
and the longer we hid,...

414
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:17,192
...the less time wed have to do
what we had to do to get up there.

415
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:22,114
There was tension. I thought that
we were both out of our element.

416
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,910
That neither of us really
should have been there.

417
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:29,204
There is something that
I dont trust in this guy.

418
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:33,667
Hes not deeply concerned
by anything. Why is he here?

419
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,470
Mark "The Australian"

420
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:48,515
When I finished university I flew to
Paris and I caught up with Philippe,...

421
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,226
...and he showed me this
extraordinary sort of diagram

422
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:55,314
...and this photograph of this building
that was being constructed in New York.

423
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,025
This is a big one now.
And the wire, a big one.

424
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,154
You know, I looked at
this huge tower or towers,

425
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,407
and Philippe was just so
enthusiastic about doing this.

426
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:11,288
So, er... I became, I guess, one
of the first members of the team.

427
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,314
I intend on a giant meadow,
its a giant, giant field,

428
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,944
to reproduce, not two roofs of the World
Trade Center, I dont have the money for that,

429
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,155
but just the outline and practise!

430
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,569
He wanted to set up a wire

431
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:53,543
to correspond exactly to the
distance between the two towers.

432
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:56,936
And to practice on
it a much as he could.

433
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,130
Even if I miss, it doesnt matter.

434
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:05,259
We had, I guess, a little bit of
a boot camp or a training camp.

435
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:11,015
Essentially we spent time there
conceiving, er... designing,

436
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:14,435
trying to work out how to make
this thing work from every aspect.

437
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:22,706
Someone had spoken to him about
the elasticity of the building

438
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:27,841
and the fact that the wind
could cause the towers to sway.

439
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,405
So there was a moment of great concern.

440
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,581
So I asked my friends
to make the cable dance.

441
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:39,043
And here is Mark the Australian,
here is Jean-Louis, Annie.

442
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,336
We would jump up and
down on these wires.

443
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:45,340
Wed try and bounce
Philippe off of the wire.

444
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,690
The World Trade Center
was extraordinary,

445
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,735
because it was 200
feet between the towers,

446
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:09,198
so how do you get a tightrope
from one tower to the other?

447
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,368
Look what you will
see. Like that? Ha ha!

448
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,205
We have to find a way
to throw something,

449
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:20,042
then you can pull a little string and
then a bigger string and then a rope,

450
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:24,379
and then eventually the wire.

451
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:30,594
At some point, I mean, I thought even
of a little airplane, radio guided.

452
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,640
Football and baseball, we have
to learn how to play baseball

453
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:38,477
for two months before we
can do that. No, no, no.

454
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,231
At some point, Jean-Louis came
up with a really silly idea.

455
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:46,819
I dont even let him finish his sentence, he
says, "Philippe, what about a bow and arrrr...?"

456
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:52,116
We drilled a very small hole in
the... in the end of an arrow,

457
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:56,411
and we attached a monofilament or
a fishing line wire to the arrow.

458
00:40:56,538 --> 00:41:00,124
The whole idea would be that
Jean-Louis would, you know,

459
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,334
send the arrow from
one building to another.

460
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,298
Then, of course, whenever we
tried it... it just didnt work.

461
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,704
Its pretty useless. Make a proper one.

462
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,418
In the end we designed a spool
that had a conical shape on it,

463
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:49,381
so that the monofilament would unravel
and go very freely through the air.

464
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,611
Great! Hey, just right. Exactly!

465
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,713
As a child I loved to climb everywhere.

466
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,800
Ill let the psychiatrist decide why.
Maybe I wanted to escape my time.

467
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,762
Maybe I wanted to see the world
from a different perspective

468
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,931
and I was an explorer at heart.

469
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,351
Who knows and who cares,
but I was a little climber,

470
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:46,855
and nobody, not my parents, not
the teachers, nobody could stop me.

471
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,532
I heard about wirewalkers,

472
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:02,537
described to me as magnificent
men and women walking in thin air.

473
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:06,250
And I thought, "Well, thats
nothing. With my ropes, I do that. "

474
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:35,612
Oh, shit! If only I could control it.
Only a few steps are going to be nice.

475
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:41,998
There was always and still is, this
'bad boy' side to Philippe's character.

476
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:45,567
He had a very strict upbringing.

477
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:49,670
And he would never have strayed
too far down that illegal road.

478
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:57,805
But he got great pleasure from
taking certain 'liberties'.

479
00:43:58,015 --> 00:44:01,746
He's so excessive, so creative,

480
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:05,017
...so each day is like
a work of art for him.

481
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:26,375
What excited him most
about this adventure...

482
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,709
...aside from being a beautiful show...

483
00:44:29,747 --> 00:44:32,648
...was that it was like a bank robbery.

484
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,708
And that pleased him enormously.

485
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,970
Ah, no. Cos its not...

486
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:17,787
Gradually things began
to get more serious

487
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:20,422
because a proper plan
had to be worked out.

488
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,796
And then the arguments between
Jean-Louis and Philippe...

489
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,232
...really got started.

490
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,936
Mark said, "If... somebody
opened the door in the stairs

491
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:35,899
"and see a very serious man, dark,
taking big... this is no good. "

492
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:40,987
Now listen, now listen. In the stairway,
we can be discovered by anyone,...

493
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:45,033
...now, so we have to be a combination
of a workman and an office man.

494
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,663
I think this is perfect. This
is perfect. And this is no good.

495
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,952
Ok, so we get through the main
gate, however we decide to do it.

496
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:58,799
The trick is going to be on the top
floor, coming out of the elevator.

497
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,619
It is better to be
dressed as office workers.

498
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,916
- No! As workers...
- Wait! Let me finish!

499
00:46:03,016 --> 00:46:05,674
It was almost impossible
to imagine them...

500
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,472
...getting into the tower undetected.

501
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:10,241
They didn't even know how
they were going to get in.

502
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,715
And I think right from the start,

503
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,718
Jean-Louis felt an
enormous responsibility.

504
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:19,985
And he wouldn't let
Philippe have it his way,...

505
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:22,857
...perhaps because he felt that
Philippe wasn't being realistic.

506
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:27,963
No! We're being complete idiots.

507
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:31,427
Jean-Louis knew I sided with him...

508
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:35,431
...and Philippe also knew I
was taking Jean-Louis' side.

509
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,920
Since long before Vary,

510
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:43,175
Annie has been angling for
an invitation to New York,...

511
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:49,806
...using tenderness, blackmail,
threats, insults and tears.

512
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:55,145
But I need absolute
detachment, complete freedom.

513
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,733
I must be a castaway on a
desert island of my dreams.

514
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:06,402
May 13th 1974

515
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,620
Philippe and I travelled
to New York together.

516
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,915
I remember looking out through
this hazy aeroplane window

517
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,626
...and seeing in the far
distance the Twin Towers.

518
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:24,799
Wed come all of this way, and
this was what we were here for.

519
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:30,388
Metropolis, Frances number
one journal of urban planning.

520
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,392
We are preparing a feature
profile of the workers...

521
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:38,563
...who are presently constructing
the World Trade Center in New York.

522
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:45,278
Our credentialed reporter, Philippe Petit, kindly
requests your co-operation for this article.

523
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,199
He told me he was a French journalist,

524
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,911
and it was just not
normal for me to say,

525
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,664
"Show me your
credentials, if you would?"

526
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,501
He was gonna write a story about the World
Trade Center for the French newspapers

527
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:04,548
and he had two photographers with him, and
I thought that was pretty good publicity.

528
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,008
Do you completely trust
the building yourself?

529
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:12,264
Is it safe up there? You mean,
tumbling down? No, its safe!

530
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,642
Here was this sort of
long-haired Australian

531
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,646
and this very volatile Frenchman,
who couldnt speak great English,

532
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,773
saying we were journalists,

533
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:26,027
and we enlisted Jim Moore
and he was the cameraman.

534
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,823
It was, er... it was interesting,
because, er... you know

535
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:33,785
Here we are, disguising
ourselves as someone who were not

536
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,329
and perfectly getting away
with it, and it was wonderful.

537
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,040
When you are working
and the weather changes,

538
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,001
you stop because you
cannot work any more?

539
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:44,838
We start doing a day up here and
suddenly the weather gets bad?

540
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,881
We have to finish the day.

541
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:50,885
So you work on the top
in very bad conditions...

542
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,763
- And you get a bit scared of that?
- No, not really.

543
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,309
I remember Jim would act like he
was taking a photograph of a worker,

544
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:01,271
then hed put the camera down
and take a photograph of a pylon

545
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:04,274
or an anchor point or
something like that.

546
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,654
The towers were not
corners facing corners.

547
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,951
They were askew, which was a problem
for me to decide where to put my wire.

548
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,913
So in principle, thats a
cable across the two roofs.

549
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,627
I decided to attach the cable to
what I believe was the strongest beam

550
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,754
at the top of the roof,

551
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,843
and then Im going to tie the
wire to here, on the South Tower.

552
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:36,264
A cable between two buildings
of very long length, it sways.

553
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,891
It goes up and down,

554
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:43,063
and there is almost an invisible
move which is a torsion on itself.

555
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:49,694
So, what we devised is a... its called
a cavaletti in the circus parlance.

556
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,866
Its actually a guy-line that is
perpendicular to the axis of the wire

557
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,077
and it goes down to the ground.

558
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:00,080
Even with permission, we couldnt go
a quarter of a mile to the ground.

559
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:04,376
Plus I needed a pair.
Heres one and heres two.

560
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,252
We know they cannot go down.

561
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:10,590
So the solution was asymmetric rigging.

562
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:14,010
Which is like this. Heres
the first attachment.

563
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,931
Each cavaletti had two legs,
a short one and a long one.

564
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:23,269
So, this is what I decided
was the best for the situation.

565
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,066
And now I am preparing for le coup

566
00:50:27,105 --> 00:50:28,157
May 28th 1974

567
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,193
We are going to do it.

568
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,155
I arrived Saturday and
the coup was due on Monday.

569
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,909
He is more and more ready for the coup,

570
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,036
but the coup itself is not ready.

571
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,247
And I was very frustrated about that.

572
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,377
I knew we had to act quickly
and I knew we had nothing.

573
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:51,172
Jean-Louis wants to know. "Have
you done what I asked you to do?

574
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:55,677
"What do I say when the guard...?"
And I dont satisfy him with my answer.

575
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,887
So he attacks my non-preparations,

576
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,890
when actually I feel that
I have prepared immensely.

577
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,688
I think the longer we were there,
the longer I was cognisant that...

578
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:11,276
...it was a very ambitious
pursuit, what we were doing.

579
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,654
We just werent ready.

580
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,866
...more suede, we must put the screw...

581
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:21,911
I never doubted Philippes
talent, his prowess on the wire.

582
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,748
Itwas the unforeseen things
that really worried me.

583
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,374
...if I need the cavalettis or not...

584
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,836
You know, Americas a
very litigious society.

585
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:33,047
You know, involuntary
manslaughter, assisted suicide.

586
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,175
...a little bit. Then
we put everything down.

587
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,261
I didnt want to be liable
for the death of a friend.

588
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:44,184
We could clearly see
that we were not ready.

589
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:48,313
Everybody could see it but
Philippe, and at the time I gave up.

590
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,234
Obviously, with the
Australian not there,

591
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,280
obviously the whole thing
is a total débâcle.

592
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,828
I told him, "Philippe,
what do you think now

593
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,208
"Its May 30th, were supposed
to go to do the coup today.

594
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:10,210
"Do you think we can do it like that?"

595
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,253
And he said no.

596
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:16,049
He said, "No, its clear
that its impossible. "

597
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:20,512
I said, "No, its not impossible. It
is possible, we are very close to it. "

598
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,557
If you want something,
nothing is impossible.

599
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:29,062
He kept repeating, "Ill be back.
Well prepare it and well do it. "

600
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:32,357
The first attempt had failed.

601
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:35,721
He called me and asked me
to come over immediately.

602
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:40,703
Of course my role was to
support and encourage him.

603
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:50,847
It was always a matter
of trying to understand

604
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,179
what was going on in his
head and of encouraging him.

605
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:56,208
That was my job and it
was really exhausting.

606
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:04,721
He would spend the night
watching television.

607
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:08,720
He only ever watched detective
movies, bank robberies,

608
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:11,859
stories about cops and robbers.

609
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:16,403
I'm convinced he was
getting in shape with this.

610
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:21,808
He was looking for the strength,...

611
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:24,507
...so he could break into these towers.

612
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:28,783
So he went back, again and again,...

613
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:31,913
...to the World Trade Center,
to the main entrance hall.

614
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:33,923
And Philippe observed very carefully...

615
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:40,055
...how people went in,
showing their passes, etc.

616
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,138
I saw him in the lobby.

617
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,557
It was just somebody that
didnt belong there,...

618
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:51,936
...like someone who had come out...
It was just... it was just er...

619
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,981
...a wrong juxtaposition.
It just was very, very odd.

620
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:59,235
"Philippe, its wonderful to see you. "

621
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:04,115
And his name is Barry. He has
seen me street-juggling in Paris.

622
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:11,748
He started talking and telling me
all this wirewalking that he did.

623
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:16,878
I think I said at some point, "If youre thinking
of doing the World Trade Center, forget it. "

624
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,924
But he sort of draws
you in to his world.

625
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:26,262
And I guess I was the kind of guy who was not
averse to doing things that were slightly er...

626
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,224
...you know not... not totally legal.

627
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,604
Barry called and said,
"Philippe, sorry to tell you,

628
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,483
"but the security around the
World Trade Center has changed,

629
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,694
"and now we all are
forced to carry an ID.

630
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,782
"But I happen to have mine
freshly unsealed from the envelope.

631
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:49,327
"It wont be too much trouble to abandon
it in your hands for a few hours. "

632
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:54,499
He did this incredibly artistic,
perfect job of copying it

633
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,835
and getting an ID card
with his own picture on it.

634
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:04,346
David aka "Donald" Rock Singer

635
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:10,974
One day he called me and said, "Ive
found two or three American guys.

636
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,812
"They are crazy, they are great
and they are ready to help. "

637
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:20,900
I meet two American young
men, Donald and Chester.

638
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,988
We met with Petit and I had
a friend named Alan Welner

639
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,073
who I went to high school with.

640
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,409
He was always up for
an adventure. Always.

641
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,037
I think Petit knew also that
this guy was a quality guy.

642
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:34,501
Alan aka "Albert" Quality Guy

643
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:40,128
Certainly smart. Certainly aware
of himself and knowing his limits.

644
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,547
The ideal accomplice.

645
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,758
He was pitching it.
He was presenting it.

646
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,721
He was desperately sort of proposing it

647
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:54,767
in a way that you would, you know,
sell a time share or something.

648
00:55:54,893 --> 00:56:00,231
I knew he was a nut or a con man or
something, but he seemed harmless enough.

649
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,319
I didnt really take it
seriously at that point.

650
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,199
I need to practise a
little bit on the wire,

651
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,911
and I need mostly to show my
two, three American friends

652
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:19,500
how to hook the cable,
how to help Jean-Louis.

653
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,420
Thats when I saw him on a cable.

654
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,007
I had never seen
concentration like that.

655
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,551
And I think I never have to this day.

656
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:33,556
And his face became this...
ageless mask of concentration.

657
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:37,351
I mean, he became like
a sphinx. It was amazing.

658
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,994
He did it beautifully and calmly.

659
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,247
He just did it in fact,
literally with his eyes closed.

660
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:02,418
Itwas just what he does.
Everything he told me was true.

661
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,681
I was really very worried.

662
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:24,085
The team included people
who were totally unreliable.

663
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,576
I dont remember right now
when we fixed the date,

664
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,412
but we had fixed the
date for August 7th.

665
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:42,665
Jean-Louis reminded
me about Notre Dame,

666
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:44,640
said it would be the same kind of thing,

667
00:57:44,674 --> 00:57:48,474
the same adventure, but this time in
New York at the World Trade Center.

668
00:57:49,045 --> 00:57:51,036
He didn't tell me much more,

669
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:53,174
just asked whether I
wanted to come or not.

670
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,014
Jean-Louis arrives and I go
and pick him up at the airport.

671
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,600
Hes with Jean-François,
whom of course I remember.

672
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,728
Hes an adorable, little
apparition and hes all smiles.

673
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:07,233
He doesnt have any questions. He
will just follow. Hes here to help.

674
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:11,864
When we arrived in New
York on the Boston train,

675
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,803
at one point we went past
the Empire State Building.

676
00:58:15,238 --> 00:58:18,401
At that moment I looked up,

677
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:20,875
I saw the height of the
Empire State Building

678
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:23,141
and I was horrified.

679
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,638
My legs started to
shake, it was terrifying!

680
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:29,581
Especially when I realised the
World Trade Center was even higher.

681
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:33,350
I kept it all to myself,
but I was terrified.

682
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:43,269
♪ When I was a boy

683
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,856
♪ I dreamed of Phillip Marlowe...

684
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:53,037
When Jean-Louis came back,
the tension rose enormously.

685
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:55,670
It became unbearable.

686
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:57,873
The problem was the team.

687
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:02,747
♪... gave me shotgun fever... ♪

688
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,376
I met the first two guys.

689
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:13,299
One of them was a musician, the
other one, I think, was a carpenter.

690
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:18,846
They really looked liked
losers. I mean, Im sorry but...

691
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,518
When I saw these guys,
I thought, "Oh, my God!"

692
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:34,446
The very night before the coup,
they arrived at the apartment

693
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:37,317
in a deplorable state.

694
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:39,083
One of them was stoned.

695
00:59:39,122 --> 00:59:43,582
He was completely gone,
lost in a haze of smoke.

696
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:47,996
Jean-Louis was absolutely
dismayed. So was Philippe.

697
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,504
It was likely I probably
had been smoking pot.

698
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,548
Yeah, likely as all hell.

699
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,094
I smoked pot every day for 35 years.

700
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,222
Theres no reason to think
I didnt smoke that day.

701
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:07,436
When Jean-Louis meets Albert,
he has a little intuition,

702
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:11,399
I can read it in Jean-Louis
face. He doesnt trust Albert.

703
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,527
You know you have this
feeling with people.

704
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:18,823
Sometimes its wrong, but
you cant help it anyway.

705
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,536
We shook hands, said hello.

706
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,622
They didnt speak English,
I spoke no French.

707
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,458
So, there wasnt too much to say.

708
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:35,089
Just, "Nice to meet you, good
luck, lets do what we have to do. "

709
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:42,385
11.08pm, August 6th

710
01:00:56,695 --> 01:01:00,323
When I felt that the whole
floor finally was silent

711
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,826
and the darkness was
there, I ventured out.

712
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:10,291
Imagine staying three hours on a beam,
you cannot walk. You need re-education.

713
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:15,629
A normal human being staying completely
unmoving on a beam for three hours cannot walk.

714
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:26,390
After a while I said, "We
cannot wait any more. "

715
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,893
I told Albert, "You
know what? You should go,

716
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:33,439
"because if I go, if Im caught,
there is no way we can do the rigging.

717
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:38,444
"Im the only one who knows about
Philippes habit and how to do it. "

718
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:45,910
So he goes on the top and
comes back five minutes later.

719
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:50,039
Im sure I just said, "OK, lets
go. Lets just get this done".

720
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:55,669
So he said, "Great, we dont know what
this noise comes from, but lets go. "

721
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:59,715
And now we moved and we go for
the most important equipment.

722
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,677
I mean a wirewalker
needs a cable to walk on.

723
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:08,974
Now we are walking toward a tiny little
construction staircase, very narrow,

724
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,268
and hes in front and I am in the back.

725
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:14,688
I see a nightmare: a policeman.

726
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:17,605
And the policeman has his eyes
open and hes looking at me!

727
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,581
There was someone there
that we hadn't expected,

728
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:22,585
sitting at a desk with a little light.

729
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:28,119
I decide to hold him. But
hold on, he is pushing me.

730
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,580
The same way I am holding him,
the same way he is pushing me.

731
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,207
What is happening?

732
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,252
There is no way I can get
Jean-François to turn around.

733
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,712
So, lets play his game. Lets follow.

734
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,594
We were very silent, because
we didnt have shoes on.

735
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,597
When we arrived on the top, I
whispered, "Did you see the guard?"

736
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,184
He said, "Of course I saw the guard, and
I was trying to alert you by pushing you.

737
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,103
"But why did you resist?"

738
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:57,857
I said, "I was trying to resist, to have
you turn around and for me to explain... "

739
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:03,925
I remember the vastness
of New York! The altitude!

740
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:10,923
The Statue of Liberty, the UN
building, all looking so tiny.

741
01:03:11,134 --> 01:03:13,193
It was magnificent.

742
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:16,296
And the sounds as well, the
police sirens all night long.

743
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,965
It was all so alive!

744
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:20,566
And we were kings!

745
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:24,633
The most beautiful moment
is when I see a shape,...

746
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,344
...actually, two silhouettes
on the other tower.

747
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,763
I recognise immediately in the darkness,

748
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:33,392
it is the silhouette of Jean-Louis and
the silhouette of Albert. They made it!

749
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:37,730
When I saw them on the
roof, I was so happy.

750
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:41,108
And the impression I got, I
remember that all the time,

751
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:45,779
you go on the roof, its all dark and there
is this red light for the planes, you know,

752
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:49,909
thats turning, and thats
like a... like a metronome,

753
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:54,079
giving you an idea of time going by.

754
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,083
There was peace and
immensity, and I... I...

755
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:02,046
In the middle of all this madness,
I suddenly had hope and joy.

756
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,111
So I put, like a bat, actually...

757
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:29,740
I put Jean-François, upside down
in that little staircase opening.

758
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,742
Just his head showing.

759
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,204
So imagine what the guard must
have seen if he were awake.

760
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:39,041
He would have seen a human beings
head, looking at him upside down!

761
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,970
First thing I did, I prepared my bow.

762
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:04,692
Prepare the arrow and prepare the
fishing line and wait for them.

763
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:16,954
So, there was this signal for Jean-Louis
to say, "I am ready to shoot. "

764
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,417
And there was a signal for me to
say, "I saw your signal. I am ready. "

765
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:25,504
And Im going to count till
ten and then he will shoot.

766
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,757
But there were no signal
for "I am not ready".

767
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,468
I hadnt thought of that
and I was not ready.

768
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:37,308
- Finally, they... they give the big signal.
- "I am ready. "

769
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:42,938
I have been waiting for so long, that
when he finally... gives a signal,

770
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:48,819
instinctively, I took the...
the bow, I aim and I aim at him.

771
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,656
And he was almost at the edge
of the... of the building.

772
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:59,121
I go hunting for the arrow.

773
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,706
Nothing!

774
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,293
Out of frustration, I
take all my clothes off,

775
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:09,632
and I think that, the line, I will
feel... the line on my naked... skin.

776
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,431
With a defeated heart,
I climb down to the edge,

777
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:22,061
and I feel a dancing fishing
line caressing my thigh.

778
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:28,525
The arrow was actually
balancing... precariously

779
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:32,279
on the very edge of
the buildings corner.

780
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:37,326
A little... ... a little
blow, and it was breezy,

781
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:39,453
would have simply made it fall.

782
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:45,334
The first thing we did
after a few ordinaires,

783
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,253
a few little ropes getting
bigger and bigger and stronger,

784
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,631
was to bring a burlap bag.

785
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:59,640
And this bag was carrying the very important
item of the communication, the interphone.

786
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,519
A little tinny toy
intercom is connected.

787
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,398
And we hear Philippes
voice on the other end.

788
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,566
And that was an important moment.

789
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:13,570
Now the four of us are together,
the work is truly going to begin.

790
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:17,366
The guard leaves,
Jean-François hardly can talk,

791
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,451
his head has been
upside down for so long.

792
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,579
But we go back, we
rush, we get our shoes.

793
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,165
And now we bring the
equipment like mad people,

794
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,335
and I put a little
trap in the staircase.

795
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:35,217
And that will be like an alarm clock,
"Ah, somebodys getting on your roof. "

796
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:39,471
By that time, everything was perfect.
I mean, it was not even midnight.

797
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,932
Itwas... normal rigging,

798
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:48,897
that means within three hours
everything wouldve been perfect.

799
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:52,526
Now we are ready to pull the
wire. Philippe has a wire ready.

800
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:57,030
The nylon rope is... in
our hand. We are ready.

801
01:07:57,157 --> 01:08:02,244
At some point, I gave
probably too much cable.

802
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:08,041
And all of a sudden, I see the
wire going... a tremendous noise.

803
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:10,252
I thought, "My God, whats going on?"

804
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,172
We almost lost the wire.

805
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:18,635
So I called Philippe, "Whats going on?"
He said, "Yeah, we could not hold it. "

806
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:22,765
Which was... very unfortunate.

807
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:27,144
The fact that I didnt speak French,

808
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:33,317
so I couldnt hear the details of what was
going wrong, was probably just as well.

809
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,781
So we had to pull... er...

810
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:43,285
probably more than 100
metres of wire plus rope.

811
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,122
I dont remember how much
we gained with each attempt.

812
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:51,084
Maybe we worked hard for one minute,
two minutes, three minutes, four minutes,

813
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:55,047
and got a tiny bit of this
endless cable up there.

814
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:59,259
Within, I dont know, half an
hour it became almost impossible.

815
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,097
Here we are in big trouble.

816
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,684
Somebody is coming on the roof.

817
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:15,526
Jean-François hears also,
and he hides immediately.

818
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,695
And I see him, hes like a dead animal.

819
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:21,615
As a child, have you ever
played hide-and-seek in a park

820
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,702
and taken refuge behind
a giant tree trunk?

821
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,538
And a policeman comes to the roof.

822
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:31,750
And then your companion comes.
Circles the trunk, he walks, you walk.

823
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,418
He stops, you stop.

824
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:37,005
The man starts turning around this
obstacle in the centre of my tower,

825
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,716
and I turn around on the
side diametrically opposed.

826
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,427
This little pas de deux
could go on forever,

827
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:45,472
until one of you turn around
and bump into each other.

828
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,391
Well, this is exactly what happened.

829
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:51,353
He turns, I turn. He stops,
I stop. He goes on, I go on.

830
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,481
Now, of course, if he would
have turned around, oops!

831
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,108

Hide-and-seek.

832
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:07,311
4.48am, August 7th

833
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:16,211
Albert was starting to...
to give up, to argue,

834
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:21,174
to say, "No, I dont want to do this any more.
Its not possible. We are not going to do it. "

835
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:25,387
It was clear we werent going to get this
job done, but there was no arguing with him.

836
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:28,932
There was just... you
know It was useless.

837
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:32,477
He was just going to
go ahead, regardless.

838
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:38,775
Its impossible, impossible that he thought we
were going to be able to rig this before daylight.

839
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:42,613
Imagine being... after
these months of preparation,

840
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:48,410
these months of all that,
and finally being on the roof,

841
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:52,122
on the roof and having to stop
because the wire is like that.

842
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,457
I mean... phew!

843
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:56,835
At dawn, I assumed, "Well,
the jig is up," you know

844
01:10:56,961 --> 01:11:01,840
We... we did the best, and now,
you know, lets get outta here.

845
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:17,208
The streets were deserted.

846
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:20,754
I found a taxi willing to take me there.

847
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:25,516
So I waited with the others.

848
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:28,223
Other members of the team joined us.

849
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:36,167
And our eyes were absolutely
glued to the towers.

850
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:38,673
I was looking out for
the slightest movement,

851
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,335
but we couldn't see a thing.

852
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:45,540
It was absolutely terrifying.

853
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:52,557
Itwas a misty day, and I
thought, "Eegh, that sucks. "

854
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:57,354
And it wasnt windless either. There
was a little bit of air that morning.

855
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,317
And you could see when the,
erm... when the cable was up there,

856
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,444
and it looked very, very slack.

857
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,672
I pulled like crazy,
like crazy, like crazy.

858
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:25,674
Finally, I got the wire.

859
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:31,221
For some reason, the last metre
was the one that came the easiest.

860
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,892
Despite the abandon of...
of his co-accomplice,

861
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:38,687
Jean-Louis has his last
communication almost,

862
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:43,483
"Philippe, I did it, I did it. Ive got two
clamps. We did it, the cable is anchored!"

863
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:54,494
All of a sudden we see this black spot
coming down off the top of the towers,...

864
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,448
...and we didnt know what the hell it
was, like, "Oh, my God, what is that?"

865
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:00,783
Suddenly we saw something, a shape,...

866
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:02,950
...just for a second, falling down.

867
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:06,339
I saw this thing falling down,...

868
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:09,885
...and... I couldnt believe it.

869
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:14,598
And I said to myself, "Thats it, youve
been fooling yourself this whole time.

870
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:19,811
"He went straight down with the first
step off the roof. He might be dead. "

871
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:24,606
There was a huge cry of relief...

872
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:26,774
...it was only a piece of clothing.

873
01:13:26,816 --> 01:13:30,217
We all thought: " He must have
just dropped something, that's ok. "

874
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:40,214
We all thought: "Of course
it's possible he could fall. "

875
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:46,379
On the top of... Philippes roof, there
was a big wheel of the... the machines.

876
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:53,261
So as soon as the elevator would move, we
would see the wheel starting to... to turn.

877
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,852
I scream, "La roue, la roue!" to
Jean-François. "The wheel, the wheel!"

878
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:04,397
Because I see the giant
wheel starting in motion,...

879
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:09,820
...and I know my fate has been written
now, time is no longer smiling at me.

880
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:18,203
At that time I was really worried. I
think, the first time I was really scared.

881
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:20,664
"Oh, my God, hes
exhausted, like I am... "

882
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:26,670
Maybe not as much, but for what he has
to do... Its really not a good thing.

883
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:31,591
The wire is the worst
wire we ever... did,...

884
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,553
...and... er... I was really scared.

885
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:43,581
We all thought it, but
we didn't believe it.

886
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:46,017
We thought it, but we didn't believe it.

887
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:55,740
And I had to make a decision

888
01:14:55,867 --> 01:15:00,328
...of shifting my weight from one
foot anchored to the building...

889
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,664
...to the foot anchored on the wire.

890
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:10,255
This is probably... I dont know... probably
the end of my life to step on that wire.

891
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:13,925
And on the other hand, something
that I could not resist...

892
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:19,014
...and I didnt make any effort to
resist, called me upon that cable.

893
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,686
And death is very close.

894
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:59,721
I start walking as a wirewalker
who is studying his cable.

895
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,808
And instead of doing an entire
study for the whole length,...

896
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:06,394
...seeing the first
cavalettiand keep walking,...

897
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,939
...seeing the middle which
is so soft and treacherous,...

898
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,274
...seeing the second
cavaletti how it is...

899
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,445
No, I do only go to the first
cavaletti and I know enough!

900
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:21,910
Now Im going to perform.

901
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:25,789
I saw his face changing.
He was very tense.

902
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:30,085
And all of a sudden there was
something... like a relief in him.

903
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:35,507
And from that time I thought,
"Thats it. He is secure. Its good.

904
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,425
"And wow, thats... "

905
01:16:53,055 --> 01:16:54,488
I saw Philippe.

906
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:57,219
I saw Philippe up there,
it was extraordinary.

907
01:16:57,259 --> 01:16:59,625
It was so, so beautiful.

908
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:06,326
It was like he was walking on a cloud.

909
01:17:09,905 --> 01:17:11,031
And there were such amazing moments.

910
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:12,131
When he lay down...

911
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:18,807
...we were thrilled by this image
of Philippe lying down up above.

912
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:29,854
And another very powerful
moment was when he...

913
01:17:33,462 --> 01:17:35,794
It was so beautiful.

914
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:40,399
When he knelt down.

915
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:44,873
There was a moment when
he knelt down and saluted.

916
01:17:52,348 --> 01:17:54,543
I cried out: " Look! Look!"

917
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:58,519
People started gathering,
but they couldn't see.

918
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:00,749
They asked me: "What
is it? What do you see?"

919
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:05,192
I said: " Look, a
wirewalker! He's walking!"

920
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,978
I sat down on the wire
on one crossing,...

921
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,022
...and I did something
that amazed people.

922
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:20,236
I actually looked all the way down, to look at
something that I will never in my life see again.

923
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:26,868
So I can tell you, probably
its a lie, but to me its not,

924
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:32,082
I heard the crowd. I saw the
crowd. I heard them murmur.

925
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,756
Beyond anything you could ever imagine.

926
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:42,967
Its just... mind-boggling.

927
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,513
The awe of the event...

928
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:50,934
...and the overwhelming largeness
of the scale of the situation...

929
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,979
...took my mind into a place where I
really wasnt that concerned about him.

930
01:18:55,106 --> 01:19:00,652
It just... it was... magical. It
was just... it was just profound.

931
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:24,509
Officer Meyers and I
observed the... er...

932
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:29,514
...tightrope dancer, because
you couldnt call him a walker,

933
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,268
approximately halfway
between the two towers.

934
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:37,480
And upon seeing us, he
started to smile and laugh.

935
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,445
They dont know how to react
to a daydreaming wirewalker...

936
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:47,749
...lying down and dialoguing with
a seagull, so they were really mad.

937
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,991
Philippe did provoke them, naturally,...

938
01:19:50,032 --> 01:19:54,059
...because that's what he
does, that's his character!

939
01:19:54,236 --> 01:19:57,330
He would come close to the
guards or the police,...

940
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,272
...who were trying to grab him,...

941
01:19:59,308 --> 01:20:03,005
...then he would turn around
and be out of their reach,...

942
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:05,878
...because they weren't
about to get on the wire!

943
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,387
When he got to the building, we
asked him to get off the high wire,...

944
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:13,308
...but instead he turned around
and ran back out into the middle.

945
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:18,188
Everybody was spellbound
in the watching of it.

946
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,274
When we observed that he
wasnt about to come in...

947
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,359
...because he seemed to
be enjoying it so much,...

948
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:27,280
...we mentioned the fact to his
associate that if he did not come in...

949
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:30,533
...we would have a helicopter
pluck him up off the wire.

950
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:34,287
At which time his associate...

951
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:38,458
...spoke to him in French,
being that hes a Frenchman.

952
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,543
"Philippe!" you know

953
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,255
And he said, "The police are going
to dislodge you and you should stop. "

954
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:50,094
And I was... I was... I was madly enraged
by that, but also it saved my life.

955
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:53,181
There is somebody out
there on a tightrope walk...

956
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:57,560
...between the two towers of the World
Trade Center, right at the tippy-top!

957
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:01,606
I personally figured I
was watching something

958
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:05,610
that somebody else would
never see again in the world.

959
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:08,696
I thought it was once in a lifetime.

960
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:20,959
I had no reason to stay on that wire
any more, and also I felt... huh!...

961
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,585
...humidity in the air
and the wind growing.

962
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:25,630
My friends later told me,

963
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:30,176
"You spent 45 minutes. You
know you did eight crossings?"

964
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,557
They grabbed me and they grounded me,...

965
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:39,435
...handcuffed... actually hands in the
back, I was thrown down the staircase,...

966
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,271
...the most dangerous part
of this whole adventure.

967
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:46,234
I almost broke my head on a narrow
staircase that led to the elevator.

968
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:51,239
We got it from the Port Authority that
they took about three days to rig it up.

969
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:55,076
Id say its about $1000
worth of cable,...

970
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,996
...and the rigging outfit itself,
its magnificent the way he did it.

971
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,831
- Did he say why he was doing it?
- No.

972
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:04,085
Why did you do it? I will explain...

973
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:06,462
You know, "Why? Why?"
And that was a very...

974
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:10,300
...again in my way of seeing America,
a very American finger-snapping question.

975
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:15,096
I did something magnificent and
mysterious, and I got a practical "why".

976
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:18,474
And the beauty of it is
that I didnt have any why.

977
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:22,437
- Why did you do this?
- Thats the thousandth "why" this morning.

978
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,230
There is no why.

979
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:33,364
I was then taken for a psychiatric
examination by a psychiatrist.

980
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:39,860
The place was a sort
of scientific area...

981
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:41,892
...where lunatics walk round in circles.

982
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:47,837
So here we were,
surrounded by mad people.

983
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:50,567
But we weren't mad, we were stars!

984
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:54,135
I kept asking for water,
because I was so dehydrated.

985
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,304
He said, "When was the
last time you drank?"

986
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,349
I said, "Are you crazy Youre
mad! Do you know what I did?

987
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,727
"I danced at the top of the world! I
am on the front pages of all the world!

988
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:06,481
"300 journalists are waiting to talk to me,
and you ask when was the last time I drank?

989
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,149
"You're completely mad!"

990
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,444
So he wrote, "The guy is completely
normal. Hes just very thirsty. "

991
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:17,116
Police took a humourless view of the act.
They took Petit and a companion into custody.

992
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:21,245
They finally decided to charge them with
trespassing and disorderly conduct...

993
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:24,540
The District Attorney offered me a deal.

994
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:28,169
He said, "Philippe, if you
agree to do a little show,

995
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,546
"like juggling three
oranges in front of four kids

996
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:36,302
"but on camera for the news and all
that, then well drop all the charges. "

997
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,304
So I said, "Sure. "

998
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:53,486
And now I climbed down the
steps of the Palais de Justice.

999
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:57,573
I saw in the crowd an admirer,
she was smiling beautifully.

1000
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:02,537
She came to me and she put her
hands on my neck in a loving way,

1001
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:07,583
and she amorously said, "Philippe,
I would like to be the first person

1002
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:12,463
"to... to welcome you
and to celebrate with you.

1003
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:15,508
"Lets... lets... I can
follow you anywhere. "

1004
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:23,516
So yes, it did end up on a
waterbed in a loft somewhere,

1005
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:28,646
but I went for a very short
little moment of... of... of...

1006
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:33,151
I dont know!... of pleasure
of the flesh. How disgusting!

1007
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:36,821
But, but, but I am
sorry, how beautiful, too!

1008
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:40,533
I mean, my friends were waiting
for me. Annie, my girlfriend...

1009
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,535
It was a betrayal of my friends.

1010
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:47,457
I remember, I called and said, "I have many
interviews to do, so Ill see you soon. "

1011
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:52,837
I had this magnificent explosion
of pleasure, lets say it,...

1012
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:56,883
...and then I went back... oh, frightened
to death, you know, to my friends,

1013
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,793
thinking Im a really, really guilty guy.

1014
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:03,741
I saw Philippe discover what
it meant to be famous,...

1015
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:10,412
...to be recognized, with expressions
of friendliness and enthusiasm.

1016
01:25:10,452 --> 01:25:14,616
People would cross the street to
tell him: "You gave us such a gift!"

1017
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:16,590
"It was so beautiful!

1018
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,593
It was a breath of
fresh air... thank you!"

1019
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:23,988
It was extraordinary and I
think in Philippe's mind,...

1020
01:25:24,032 --> 01:25:26,159
...many things were changing.

1021
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:30,917
I am a celebrity in
New York. People say,

1022
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,669
"Are you the guy who walked
between the Twin Towers?"

1023
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:36,631
I say, "Yeah, yeah, its
me. " "This is incredible!"

1024
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,674
Then some people say, "Are you the
guy who...?" I say, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"

1025
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,502
Then people say, "Are you the
guy...? I say, "Yeah! Yeah! Its me!"

1026
01:25:40,582 --> 01:25:44,177
So the judge's sentence
was pretty harsh, I thought.

1027
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:47,985
I was expelled from the United States.

1028
01:25:51,487 --> 01:25:51,487
There was a love story.

1029
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:55,650
We talked about it on the plane.
Jean-François was so happy.

1030
01:25:55,776 --> 01:26:00,822
He said, "Well, Im ready for the next time.
" I said, "No, there will not be any more...

1031
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:04,700
"... any more stories like that. "

1032
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:09,455
There was something broken,
probably, in this friendship.

1033
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,543
It doesnt matter, because...

1034
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:19,340
Well, basically because we did
it. And... er... basically...

1035
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:27,223
I mean, you cannot
take away what happened.

1036
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:28,766
And er...

1037
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,395
Yeah, what happened is that... er...

1038
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,087
But it was clear...

1039
01:26:54,389 --> 01:26:59,122
...that Philippe had gone through
an incredible moment in his life...

1040
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:03,488
...and he was starting
something else, a new life.

1041
01:27:06,902 --> 01:27:09,735
Strangely, I felt the same way.

1042
01:27:11,806 --> 01:27:15,173
Our relationship was
meant to end here...

1043
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,440
...and it was beautiful that way.

1044
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:01,859
To me, its really... its so simple,...

1045
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:05,905
...that life should be
lived on the edge of life.

1046
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,991
You have to exercise rebellion.

1047
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:16,624
To refuse to taper yourself to
rules, to refuse your own success,...

1048
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,876
...to refuse to repeat yourself,...

1049
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:23,965
...to see every day, every year,
every idea as a true challenge,...

1050
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:27,551
...and then you are going to
live your life on the tightrope.
