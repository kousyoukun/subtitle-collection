1
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:20,522
DON'T LOOK NOW

2
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,810
Action Man patrol, open fire!

3
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,891
This is your Commander speaking.

4
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:34,052
Mortar attack, dig in!

5
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,261
What are you reading?

6
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:40,981
I'm trying to answer Christine's
question: If the world is round,

7
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,582
why is a frozen pond flat?

8
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:52,903
That's a good question.

9
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:24,428
"Lake Ontario
curves more than 3 degrees from its

10
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:28,348
east to its west shore".
Frozen water isn't flat!

11
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:32,069
Nothing is what it seems.
- My cigarettes...

12
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:34,509
Did you put the slides together?

13
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,830
No, I put the duplicates in my tray.

14
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:56,072
Action Man patrol, fall in.

15
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:00,393
Enemy in sight. Range one thousand.

16
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:10,954
Oh shit!

17
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,319
What's the matter?

18
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,639
Nothing.

19
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,681
Dad!

20
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,220
Everything is rotten.

21
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,781
The stone is like tobacco.

22
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,181
Should I carry on?

23
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:26,061
No. It's already late.
Let's call it a day.

24
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:29,222
My wife's waiting for me.

25
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:33,942
See you tomorrow at San Nicol?
- Yeah, exactly.

26
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:36,343
Thanks a lot!

27
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,825
Ciao!

28
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:14,548
Hi!
- Hi.

29
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,189
What are you doing?
- Writing to Johnny. - What?

30
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,589
Just a letter. How'd it go?

31
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:26,030
The deeper we go, the more Byzantine.
I'm restoring a fake.

32
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,510
And you can't change course?
- They haven't enough bread.

33
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,031
The options are restore the fake
or let it sink in the sea.

34
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:39,952
What did you say?
- I said, "Daddy's still hard at work

35
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:43,792
on the windows of St. Nicholas,
our 16th century church.

36
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,193
His repairs
are no different than the originals.

37
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:51,113
I'll send you slides,
maybe you can tell. Hope Ellies

38
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:55,954
is more reasonable this term.
I think that's his Captain.

39
00:08:56,395 --> 00:09:00,995
"I'm enclosing the money
for your gym shoes. Buy the ones

40
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:04,995
with the padded soles."
Another boring letter.

41
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:07,916
God, it's cold.

42
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:15,997
I've got something in my eye.

43
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,879
Do you want me to add something?
- Why not send him a card yourself?

44
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:34,199
It's so cold in here and
the waiters won't come. Hello!

45
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,441
I must take some time off.

46
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,162
Signori?

47
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:52,962
What do you want?
- I'll have what I had last night.

48
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:57,203
Pollo sopresso, scampi al ferri,

49
00:09:57,643 --> 00:10:02,803
vino bianco, due insalate verdi...
Good, that's it.

50
00:10:03,244 --> 00:10:05,404
Did you see the bishop today?
- No.

51
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:08,724
I'm terribly sorry!

52
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:10,365
Sorry.

53
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:16,845
What?
- No, she's got something in her eye.

54
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,887
I think I'd better go help them.

55
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:29,407
Perhaps I can show you where it is.
- Oh, it's awfully kind of you.

56
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:54,771
I hope you don't think us rude.

57
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,251
Rude? Why?

58
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:58,611
Staring at you out there.

59
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:02,692
Comes from the country.
Country people always stare more.

60
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:07,012
I'm frightfully sorry.
- I didn't notice it even if you were.

61
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:09,493
Which eye is it?
- The left one.

62
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,773
Well, let me help.
- Help! - I can try.

63
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,414
No!
You nearly put Jocelyn's eye out

64
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:18,174
the last time you tried poking about.

65
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:22,055
Perhaps...

66
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,175
...perhaps I can help?

67
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:27,615
That's awfully kind.

68
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:29,256
Oh dear.

69
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:34,216
My sister is blind you see.

70
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:37,897
I see.
- Yes.

71
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:20,383
That's it. It was a tiny

72
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:25,423
black speck. I think I've got it.
- Well done.

73
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:28,064
Thank you very much. Goodness.

74
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,384
You do remind me of my daughter.

75
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:35,265
Really?
- Only her hair is darker.

76
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:37,985
Your handkerchief.

77
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:44,386
You're sad...
and there's no need to be!

78
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:48,827
My sister's psychic.
- She wants you to know...

79
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:53,587
I've seen her and she
wants you to know that she's happy.

80
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:58,308
I've seen your little girl
sitting between you and your husband

81
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:01,029
and she was laughing!

82
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:02,549
Yes,

83
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:05,789
she was with you!

84
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,990
And she's laughing!

85
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,390
I'm sorry if we stared.

86
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:19,311
She's wearing a shiny little mac.

87
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,192
Christine!

88
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:24,592
But she's laughing!

89
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,992
She's happy as can be!

90
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:45,074
You're very like her.
The forehead, the eyes...

91
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,555
Is that better?
- Yes.

92
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,036
Shall I fetch your husband?
- No. I'm alright, thank you.

93
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:56,036
Jolly good!

94
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,797
Just leave me alone. I'll be fine.

95
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:01,197
Alright, my dear.

96
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,358
Did you

97
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:10,678
really see her?

98
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,759
She was there.

99
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,159
She was there!

100
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:34,481
I thought you were right.
I felt you should.

101
00:14:41,603 --> 00:14:43,083
Signore.

102
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:04,326
I sent your food back to be warmed.

103
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:09,766
The mastic that works it is number 3.
- Oh dear, John, I must stand up.

104
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:49,172
Hey!
- I'm sorry.

105
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,453
Signore!
- Thanks.

106
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:02,134
That's it then.

107
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,580
They're only children here!
- It was the nearest hospital.

108
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:53,981
I was playing with them.
- The doctor... - John?

109
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:58,382
Christine is still with us.
- Christine's dead, Laura.

110
00:16:58,822 --> 00:17:01,982
Christine's dead.
- I know, of course!

111
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:04,703
The two ladies in the restaurant,

112
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:07,663
they were watching us while we ate.

113
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:12,583
They told me they could see
Christine sitting between us.

114
00:17:13,024 --> 00:17:17,224
This is two people we don't even know!
Listen! Listen now!

115
00:17:17,665 --> 00:17:21,065
There's one that's blind,
she has the second sight.

116
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:25,265
She described to me
Christine's red plastic mac.

117
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:30,066
Laura...
- John, I'm perfectly alright!

118
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,587
I haven't felt as good as this
in months and months!

119
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:39,987
I don't need pills,
I'm not going crazy. I feel great!

120
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:46,788
When did the doctor say you could go?
- Anytime. I only fainted.

121
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,229
I wish you'd believe me.
I really feel fine.

122
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,670
I really feel good at last!
- I believe you!

123
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,510
Seeing is believing.

124
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:02,191
Put your shoes on.

125
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:20,273
Out of the way!
- Stop! Stay there!

126
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,794
But I must go through!

127
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,474
A homicide occurred here!

128
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:29,994
What's going on?
- A homicide. You must stop.

129
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:36,315
What did he say? Homicide?
- Yeah.

130
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,836
Stop!
- But I must go through!

131
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:45,997
You can't. Stop now!

132
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:51,758
What are you doing?

133
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:56,038
Turn left!

134
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,519
You can't go through here.

135
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,800
Isn't this where you were with...
- No.

136
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,001
I want to stop at this church.

137
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:22,682
It's closed. Why that one?

138
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:28,323
I just wanted to...
I want to say a prayer.

139
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:31,683
Oh, Laura!

140
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:47,165
I don't like this church at all.
- But I do.

141
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,767
Do you have any change?
- Yes.

142
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:01,367
I'm going to light a candle for her.
- How much are candles?

143
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,128
Fifty.

144
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:06,288
I don't have any fifties.

145
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:09,688
Maybe I'll light six.

146
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,730
Thank you, my love.

147
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:02,896
The Madonna by Antonio Rizzo

148
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:07,856
in about 1 490.
The grille work is also by Rizzo.

149
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:10,257
Note the flowers woven into...

150
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,701
Jesus!
- You hypocrite!

151
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:38,341
The bishop!
I'm an hour and a half late!

152
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:41,181
In the name of the Father, the Son,

153
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:46,382
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
May the mercy and

154
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:49,782
Iove of our Father
and the peace of the Holy Spirit

155
00:21:50,223 --> 00:21:52,183
be with you.

156
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:12,826
How are you, John?

157
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:15,786
It was entirely my fault.

158
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:19,267
It wasn't John's fault.
- A woman to share your sins with.

159
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:21,747
Laura, you're looking better.

160
00:22:22,587 --> 00:22:26,307
I'm really terribly sorry.
- It's okay.

161
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:30,548
These workmen took me around.
We have made some great advances.

162
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:34,829
I'd like you to look at the mosaics
that need to be refired.

163
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:40,229
I've already been much too long.
When are you coming to stay with me?

164
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,430
Thursday, if that's alright?
- I look forward to it.

165
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:50,671
I took some samples from the pilings.
We're in trouble down there, too.

166
00:22:51,111 --> 00:22:55,831
The churches belong to God, but
he doesn't seem to care about them.

167
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,833
Does he have other priorities?

168
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:06,153
We have stopped listening.

169
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,514
Are you a Christian, Laura?

170
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:15,634
I don't know.
I'm kind to animals and children.

171
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,555
St. Nicholas

172
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:22,955
of this church is the Patron Saint
of scholars and children. Interesting.

173
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,236
We must talk, John!

174
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:32,157
Thursday I'll have your room ready.
- Thank you.

175
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:36,717
I'll have the mastic samples by then.
Acidity is ruining all the adhesives.

176
00:23:37,158 --> 00:23:40,438
I look forward to hearing about it.
Thursday.

177
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,798
Ciao.
- Goodbye!

178
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,159
He doesn't give an
ecclesiastical fuck about the church.

179
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,000
Why did he ask me if I was Christian?
- Because you kissed his ring.

180
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,400
What in God's name made you do that?

181
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:02,001
Ciao Giorgio!
- See you tomorrow! - Yes.

182
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:11,322
You know? Your bishop really
makes me feel quite uneasy.

183
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:14,883
He probably makes God
feel less than immaculate.

184
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,043
Signor!
- No.

185
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:21,684
The key!
- I have the key.

186
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:24,724
He has the key!

187
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,005
Be careful! If you ruin it,

188
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,685
I don't know what I'd do!

189
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,406
I'm going
to get down to some work tomorrow.

190
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,447
Enough of this idling around.

191
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:46,367
What?

192
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:56,408
Don't we have to book at this place?
I don't want what happened last time!

193
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,089
What place?
- John!

194
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,890
The place we're going to be eating at!

195
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,890
Yeah, sure.

196
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,010
Where is my Neutralgina then?

197
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:20,212
You'll have to read this!

198
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:32,334
What are you doing?

199
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:35,734
I can't hear what you're saying.
- I'm shouting!

200
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:38,815
I still can't hear.
- What are you doing?

201
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,455
I'm having a bath.

202
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:44,695
You heard me that time.

203
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:28,621
You know those lumps are coming back
on the side of your waist?

204
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:32,622
See?

205
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:47,904
85 kilos, which is 1 90 pounds.

206
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:55,585
You okay?
- I'm okay.

207
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:22,869
Come in!

208
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,030
May I tidy up?
- Yes, yes.

209
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:32,591
I'll come back later.

210
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:45,832
It's a miracle
I didn't hurt myself when I fainted.

211
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:50,153
The unconscious body reacts faster
than the mind ever can.

212
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:53,313
Perhaps.

213
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,714
You have toothpaste on your mouth.

214
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:04,555
Eat it off!

215
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:11,916
I can't get it off.

216
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:21,157
This.

217
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:39,514
Yes.
- No.

218
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:41,914
Really?
- Yes.

219
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:47,715
You will be eating here tonight,
I hope?

220
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:50,675
No, we're eating out tonight.

221
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:53,475
Too bad. Have a good night.

222
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:57,356
Thank you.
- Good night.

223
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:02,877
You can to go home.

224
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,480
Come here, I think I found the way!
- We went over this bridge already!

225
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:31,121
I never minded being lost in Venice.

226
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:36,841
Now, we take the second left
and then the first left or right.

227
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,242
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

228
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:44,202
A nice dark little alley!

229
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:49,283
Yes, this is it.
- It isn't.

230
00:33:49,724 --> 00:33:52,044
Yes, it is.
- It isn't, John.

231
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:56,444
Come on.
- No, it isn't.

232
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:15,367
Oh, rats! I'm getting out of here.

233
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:21,488
I know this place.

234
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,650
This is it! It's Ponte Giretto!

235
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,930
What?
- Here!

236
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,450
- No, I...

237
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:57,213
What's that, John?
- It's okay, I found the real world.

238
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,093
Come on.

239
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:09,734
What on earth was that?
- A cat or a rat.

240
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:13,175
Maybe something else.
- A rat?

241
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:24,897
This was just around the corner
from where we were!

242
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:28,297
I know where we are now.

243
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:37,498
Ready?
- Slow!

244
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,021
Slow!

245
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,221
Yeah. Higher.

246
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,662
Beautiful. Good.

247
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:23,465
Ready?
- No!

248
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:26,425
It'll fall down!

249
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:30,666
Go!

250
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:32,666
Go!

251
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:37,627
Are you ready?

252
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,149
Hello!

253
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:53,669
Hello!
- Hello!

254
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:56,949
How extraordinary to see you.
Oh, it's Mrs. Baxter.

255
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,830
Yes, I know.
- My husband's restoring this church.

256
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,790
Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

257
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:08,911
Hold on.
- Yeah.

258
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,792
Stop! Wait.
- It's good.

259
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:15,432
Yes, I remember her hair.

260
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:17,873
Light hair and silky soft.

261
00:37:18,313 --> 00:37:22,673
She tossed it as she laughed.
Did she die suddenly?

262
00:37:23,114 --> 00:37:27,274
Heather! You've no right to...
- No, I wouldn't mind talking.

263
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:31,354
I'll just go and get my coat.
Would you mind waiting?

264
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:32,955
Thanks.

265
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,155
No, no! There!

266
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:40,356
Yes, there.
- No, there!

267
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:43,076
Okay.
- Yes!

268
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:45,396
Hold on!
- Here.

269
00:37:45,837 --> 00:37:48,317
Wait still. Now.

270
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:53,117
I'll hold it right here.

271
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:56,038
Pull, pull!

272
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:07,039
Sunday afternoon,

273
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,920
we'd just finished lunch.

274
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,320
Before I used to smoke then.
Now, I haven't had a cigarette.

275
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:22,801
John just suddenly got up
and rushed down to the pond, almost

276
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:26,362
as if he knew
something was going to happen.

277
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:29,282
Yes.
- Well, it was too late. Strange.

278
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:31,803
Yes, of course!
- What?

279
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,883
Of course! He has the gift.

280
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:39,564
That's why the child was trying
to talk to him. He has the gift.

281
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:44,084
Even if he doesn't know it.
Even if he's resisting it.

282
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:48,285
It's a curse as well as a gift.

283
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:52,446
Wait, there's a knot.

284
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:54,406
Slow!

285
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:57,166
It's off-center!

286
00:38:57,607 --> 00:39:00,047
It never was in the middle.

287
00:39:00,487 --> 00:39:03,567
Over! To the left!
- Okay.

288
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,048
You can't

289
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:10,728
ever contact people, can you?

290
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,209
We're often asked. She's quite famous.

291
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:17,369
They all want a lot of mumbo-jumbo,

292
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:22,530
and holding hands. Second sight
is a gift from the Good Lord.

293
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,610
It is impertinent
to call his creatures

294
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:28,251
back for our entertainment.

295
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:31,331
It wouldn't be for my entertainment.

296
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:35,132
Would you come for tea?
When your husband's finished?

297
00:39:35,572 --> 00:39:38,052
Just for a little while?

298
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:43,133
I'd like that. Thank you.
That alright?

299
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:46,133
I make no promises.

300
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:48,854
No.

301
00:39:50,934 --> 00:39:53,254
It's ridiculous!
- They only want to meet you!

302
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:56,895
I'm not getting involved
in a session of mumbo-jumbo!

303
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:02,255
I've been trying to hang on to myself,
to get rid of this emptiness

304
00:40:02,696 --> 00:40:05,776
that's been with me like some pain,

305
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:10,096
and finally through these two women
I've discovered how!

306
00:40:10,537 --> 00:40:14,097
They disapprove of mumbo-jumbo, too!
They used that very word.

307
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,898
Of course they do!
- They just want to help!

308
00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:22,138
Laura, do you not see...
- She's going to try and reach her.

309
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,780
Laura, that's enough.
Now listen to me.

310
00:40:37,221 --> 00:40:41,901
I've listened to you. You said let
the children play where they want to.

311
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:45,821
You let her go near that pond.
- Thanks for the memories.

312
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:50,502
You said you'd give your life
in exchange for hers. Well you can't.

313
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:53,543
Jesus H. Christ.
- John!

314
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:59,463
She's trying to get in touch with us!
Maybe to forgive!

315
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,864
Go, go on to your crazy women.
They can have their victim.

316
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:24,347
Here, drink this. Whisky.

317
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:28,547
Thank you. I don't really need it.
- You may, child.

318
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:31,148
I'll be back in a jiffy.

319
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:33,548
Here you are.

320
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:40,549
Where are you?
- Me? Oh, I'm here.

321
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,590
Oh, the children.

322
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,190
Who are you looking at?

323
00:41:49,151 --> 00:41:52,831
There's a boy here
with rolled-up shirtsleeves.

324
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:55,991
Difficult to tell his age.
- Yes, Anthony.

325
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:59,592
And then Charles in his uniform.

326
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:02,512
Then the three girls.
- Yes.

327
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,673
Then there's Angus.
- This little bust?

328
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:09,433
Yes.
- Oh, it's lovely.

329
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:13,434
Yes, he was a gentle child.

330
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:23,475
You haven't touched your drink.
- No.

331
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,316
Was that Angus?

332
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:31,556
I was just looking at the pictures
of your family. They're wonderful.

333
00:42:31,997 --> 00:42:35,397
It jars you, losing one like that.
But I had two more.

334
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:38,077
So can you, I daresay.

335
00:42:40,678 --> 00:42:42,918
Nothing can replace
the one that's gone.

336
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:47,159
Now then...

337
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,920
It's alright.

338
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,160
It's alright!

339
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:28,124
Are your legs crossed?

340
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:29,605
Yes.

341
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,367
Switch the light out.

342
00:44:57,777 --> 00:44:59,177
Yes.

343
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:09,459
Yes!

344
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:14,419
Yes!

345
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,020
What are you doing there?
- I'm English.

346
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:27,101
John! Yes!

347
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:30,901
English.
- What are you doing here?

348
00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:37,062
Who are you?
- English.

349
00:45:40,183 --> 00:45:42,583
English.
- What's going on here?

350
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:45,904
Peeping Tom!

351
00:46:01,346 --> 00:46:04,306
What did she say?

352
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:08,307
What did she say?

353
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:13,307
What did she say?

354
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:56,033
I got scared for you.

355
00:46:56,474 --> 00:47:00,834
I told you it was alright.

356
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:10,075
How much have you been drinking?
- You scared for me?

357
00:47:20,357 --> 00:47:23,197
You're not going to be sick, are you?
- Screw them!

358
00:47:23,638 --> 00:47:27,438
You just got the sniff.
- I am not going to be sick!

359
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:33,838
Alright, John, the blind one,
Heather, she really has second sight.

360
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:37,039
You'd understand if you'd...

361
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,200
Today when I was there, she went
into the most incredible trance.

362
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,120
Really...
- Concentrate. - No, John!

363
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:46,761
Yes?

364
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:52,201
She said that your life
is in danger while you're in Venice.

365
00:47:52,642 --> 00:47:57,602
She kept on and on saying that.
- I am going to be sick.

366
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:30,726
I wouldn't go in there
for a couple of minutes if I were you.

367
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:35,887
I haven't thrown up for ten years.

368
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:37,808
John?

369
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:44,728
I really think we must leave Venice.
It was a warning. It was Christine.

370
00:48:45,169 --> 00:48:50,129
She was trying to warn us.
How can I... We must leave!

371
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,690
John!
It was Christine, our daughter!

372
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,730
My daughter is dead.
She does not come peeping with

373
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:01,971
messages back from the fucking grave!
Christine

374
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:06,091
is dead! She is dead, dead, dead!

375
00:49:22,774 --> 00:49:25,974
You must think I'm ill then?
- Yes.

376
00:49:32,856 --> 00:49:37,416
If I'm ill,
I should be seeing Dr. Jameson.

377
00:49:37,856 --> 00:49:39,056
Yep.

378
00:49:40,017 --> 00:49:44,977
Maybe I am.
Maybe I left England too soon.

379
00:49:50,418 --> 00:49:51,498
Maybe...

380
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:55,338
Maybe
those women were influencing me.

381
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:59,379
Maybe I shouldn't see them again.
That's what you want, isn't it?

382
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,380
Yeah.

383
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,820
Maybe I should take my pills again.

384
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:09,741
On the desk right there. There.

385
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:14,901
Here.

386
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:16,902
Here.

387
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:29,343
You...

388
00:50:29,984 --> 00:50:33,944
You could get
a couple of weeks off, couldn't you?

389
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:36,904
Yeah.
- Could you?

390
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:40,145
Yes.

391
00:50:46,346 --> 00:50:49,306
Do you really think you could, John?

392
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:58,427
Alright, Laura.

393
00:50:59,988 --> 00:51:01,948
Alright.

394
00:51:27,472 --> 00:51:29,152
Hello.
- Hello.

395
00:51:29,592 --> 00:51:31,632
Hello?
- Who on earth is it?

396
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:36,152
Hello. - Hello?
- What time is it, for God's sake?

397
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,913
Operator!

398
00:51:38,353 --> 00:51:40,273
Operator!
- What time is it?

399
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:41,874
Operator!

400
00:51:42,754 --> 00:51:43,954
Hello!

401
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:47,474
Operator!
Where is this call coming from?

402
00:51:47,915 --> 00:51:49,115
Hello!

403
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:51,875
Hello!

404
00:51:52,315 --> 00:51:56,435
Where in England?
- Hello! Is that Mr. Baxter?

405
00:51:56,916 --> 00:52:00,796
John Baxter here.
- Oh, this is Anthony Babbage here.

406
00:52:01,436 --> 00:52:04,796
Headmaster, Porton School.
Yes, that's right.

407
00:52:05,237 --> 00:52:08,837
I'm awfully sorry
to get you so late at night...

408
00:52:09,278 --> 00:52:11,358
What time is it with you?

409
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:16,758
Oh, I see. We got your telephone
number from your London people.

410
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:21,839
Yes. There's been
a bit of an accident.

411
00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:27,839
It's your son, Johnny. He's been
to the San and he's in capable hands,

412
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,240
but Matron thinks...

413
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,241
Mr. Baxter? It's Mandy Babbage here.

414
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:37,441
Yes, poor little Johnny.
It was during fire practice.

415
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:40,962
There's nothing to worry about.
- Good.

416
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:43,162
Yes.

417
00:52:46,803 --> 00:52:48,883
Tell them I'm on the next plane home.

418
00:52:49,643 --> 00:52:51,243
What was that?

419
00:52:51,684 --> 00:52:54,364
My wife will be there this morning.

420
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:58,284
Yes.
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

421
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:02,245
Yes, goodnight. Good morning.

422
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:05,085
Bye.

423
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:08,845
This is what I meant
about leaving Venice. They were right.

424
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,686
This is it, this is what they meant.

425
00:53:13,127 --> 00:53:15,007
You see?

426
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:21,247
Pronto! Pronto!

427
00:53:21,728 --> 00:53:24,248
Allitalia, please.

428
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:28,648
Get me the airport then.
What time do they open?

429
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:32,249
Oh, Christ! Thank you. Goodnight.

430
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,409
Darling, she said
that she's sure that he'll be okay.

431
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:40,290
But that is not so! You know that.

432
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:44,970
I won't ask you any more
favors for a year!

433
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:49,571
You'll be doing the right thing
if you do this for me.

434
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:59,052
It's a charter flight, you've got
the last seat. - Fantastic!

435
00:53:59,493 --> 00:54:02,053
He's finding out where they go from.
- John,

436
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:05,533
don't forget to ask the bishop

437
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:08,814
about staying over in England.
- Three weeks?

438
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:13,174
Whatever you can do.
I just need time away from this.

439
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:17,655
I'll tell him today.
- You can't come with me now?

440
00:54:18,096 --> 00:54:21,216
No. Call tonight.
I'll be there by the weekend.

441
00:54:22,456 --> 00:54:26,736
Her name is Signora Baxter.
How much does it cost?

442
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:28,697
In 1 0 minutes?

443
00:54:29,297 --> 00:54:31,577
In 1 0 minutes. From Riva Schiavoni?

444
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,578
Thanks. You're a friend.

445
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:39,738
The boat leaves in ten minutes
from Riva Schiavoni.

446
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,139
Mr. Baxter!
Yes?

447
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,259
We are closing!

448
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,620
I'll collect everything this morning!

449
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:55,420
I can't believe this!

450
00:55:01,342 --> 00:55:06,302
Good morning. I am John Baxter.
- The Hotel told me.

451
00:55:10,503 --> 00:55:13,583
Give Johnny my love.

452
00:55:24,185 --> 00:55:27,145
I'll call you tonight, okay?

453
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,035
This has great significance!

454
00:56:37,475 --> 00:56:40,595
The Holy Virgin and
the Patriarch of Constantinople.

455
00:56:41,756 --> 00:56:44,916
Yes.
- It tells the story...

456
00:56:45,356 --> 00:56:48,316
Beautiful work.
- Thank you.

457
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:53,237
I discovered it myself

458
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,917
and immediately had it examined.

459
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:02,238
It is about
the church's foundation...

460
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,079
Morning!

461
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,360
Good morning!

462
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,520
I'm sorry, but this church
means a great deal to him.

463
00:57:17,961 --> 00:57:20,001
You have all worked so hard.

464
00:57:20,441 --> 00:57:25,561
Are those the mosaics?
- Yes, they arrived this morning.

465
00:57:26,602 --> 00:57:28,522
Is something the matter?

466
00:57:30,002 --> 00:57:34,202
Our son had an accident,
and Laura flew to London at four

467
00:57:34,643 --> 00:57:37,803
this morning.
- I will pray for you.

468
00:57:38,244 --> 00:57:40,524
It'll be okay.

469
00:57:40,964 --> 00:57:43,364
Laura's had some complications since

470
00:57:44,004 --> 00:57:45,124
Christine...

471
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:48,045
You should have gone with her.

472
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:54,085
Can I see the mosaics?
- Of course.

473
00:58:01,807 --> 00:58:03,047
Marvelous!

474
00:58:03,487 --> 00:58:06,807
The firm has worked
for my family for over 200 years.

475
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:11,208
Will they be able to match those?
- Sure.

476
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:15,929
May I compare them?

477
00:59:02,575 --> 00:59:05,535
Lower me down!

478
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:10,176
Slowly!

479
00:59:17,258 --> 00:59:19,418
Yes, good.

480
01:00:25,627 --> 01:00:27,507
Take that rope!

481
01:00:40,949 --> 01:00:42,029
It'll hold!

482
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:45,269
Take that rope!

483
01:01:17,314 --> 01:01:19,274
Hold it tight!

484
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:31,116
Get him!

485
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:56,479
You had me worried! Mama mia!

486
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,880
I've never seen anything like it!

487
01:02:14,602 --> 01:02:17,002
I need a cigarette.
- Yes, yes.

488
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:20,323
Would you like
to sit for a few moments?

489
01:02:20,763 --> 01:02:23,723
No, I'm going to walk for a bit.

490
01:02:24,164 --> 01:02:27,124
May I walk with you?
- Please.

491
01:02:31,285 --> 01:02:35,205
My father was killed in a fall.
- Yes?

492
01:02:35,645 --> 01:02:36,845
Yes.

493
01:02:38,246 --> 01:02:39,686
Unbelievable.

494
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:41,526
What?

495
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:46,926
My wife was warned
that I was in danger.

496
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:48,807
Warned?

497
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,527
It was...

498
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,688
like a...

499
01:02:57,088 --> 01:03:00,048
kind of prophecy.

500
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:06,489
I wish I didn't have to
believe in prophecy.

501
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,730
I do, but I wish I didn't have to.

502
01:03:40,014 --> 01:03:41,974
What happened?

503
01:03:42,615 --> 01:03:45,095
We found a body.

504
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:48,215
I hope it's not another murder.

505
01:03:58,457 --> 01:04:00,977
We should go.

506
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:33,301
Yes.
- Hold her. A little closer.

507
01:04:33,742 --> 01:04:35,142
Don't turn her!

508
01:04:39,303 --> 01:04:39,743
Careful!

509
01:05:13,107 --> 01:05:18,067
Excuse me. We waited
until this afternoon...

510
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,150
Pronto!

511
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:37,510
The bishop's driver
will come by and pick up my things.

512
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:39,151
Thank you.

513
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,158
Laura!

514
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,600
Laura!

515
01:06:55,602 --> 01:06:57,762
Hey, watch out!

516
01:07:26,886 --> 01:07:31,366
Where is the manager?
- It is closed, Signore.

517
01:07:48,929 --> 01:07:51,449
Signor Alexander...
- Signor Baxter...

518
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:57,050
I thought... the end of the season,
you understand. It's my holiday.

519
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,810
Has Mrs. Baxter come back here?
- La Signora?

520
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:05,571
My wife, yes. Has she come back here?
- But she left this morning.

521
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:09,092
I just saw her on the Grand Canal.

522
01:08:09,532 --> 01:08:13,492
Has she come back here?
- She missed the plane?

523
01:08:13,933 --> 01:08:16,773
No, I'm just asking
if my wife's come back here!

524
01:08:17,213 --> 01:08:21,173
No, Signore.
We are closed.

525
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:28,695
Momi!

526
01:08:29,135 --> 01:08:32,175
Haven't you hung up the sign yet?

527
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:36,175
We hang up the sign,
and they come anyway!

528
01:08:49,818 --> 01:08:54,778
My luggage get away all right? - Yes.
- You didn't see my wife? - No.

529
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,431
Yes.

530
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:26,271
Here.

531
01:10:28,231 --> 01:10:29,231
Yes.

532
01:10:29,672 --> 01:10:32,112
He's ready.

533
01:10:37,873 --> 01:10:40,593
The inspector is in room 87.

534
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:43,833
Room 87.
- Yes. I hope that helps.

535
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:46,714
Thank you.
- Goodbye.

536
01:11:17,278 --> 01:11:18,238
Hello!

537
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:24,359
Sit down, Mr. Baxter.

538
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:29,519
This is your wife,
and these are the sketches.

539
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,920
How are they?
- I guess you'd recognize them.

540
01:11:37,641 --> 01:11:42,801
Age makes women grow to look more
like each other. Don't you find that?

541
01:11:44,722 --> 01:11:48,682
Old men decay
and each becomes quite distinct.

542
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:52,763
Women seem to converge, eh?

543
01:11:53,963 --> 01:11:59,243
I hadn't thought about it.
- The skill of the police artist

544
01:12:00,204 --> 01:12:03,244
is to make the living appear dead.

545
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:11,485
You no longer stay at the "Europa"?

546
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:15,326
No, it closed for the winter.

547
01:12:16,527 --> 01:12:20,127
Tell me
what happened from the beginning.

548
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:23,407
My wife met these two women...

549
01:12:23,848 --> 01:12:26,288
a couple of days ago.

550
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:31,848
The blind one claimed to have seen
Christine, our dead daughter.

551
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:35,769
She said Christine was happy.

552
01:12:36,209 --> 01:12:40,249
My wife collapsed.
When she came round she was changed.

553
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,450
She was happy,
she had come to terms with the death.

554
01:12:45,691 --> 01:12:48,691
She... she was...

555
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,771
her whole self again. We...
- Did you have a row?

556
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:55,412
A row? No, well...

557
01:12:57,092 --> 01:12:59,972
I was only trying to protect her.

558
01:13:00,413 --> 01:13:04,973
It didn't make any difference
because she saw the women anyway.

559
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:08,333
And when she came back,

560
01:13:08,774 --> 01:13:11,654
last night, we went to bed.

561
01:13:12,094 --> 01:13:14,654
There was a call from England.

562
01:13:15,095 --> 01:13:20,735
Our son goes to school in England.
They told us he had an accident.

563
01:13:21,176 --> 01:13:24,216
My wife said that she had been warned.

564
01:13:24,576 --> 01:13:27,016
She got on the first plane to England.

565
01:13:27,457 --> 01:13:32,897
I saw her go. I put her on the boat.
I saw her leave at 8:30.

566
01:13:34,378 --> 01:13:36,898
Have you called the airport?

567
01:13:37,338 --> 01:13:41,698
Yes. The plane was full,
that's all I know.

568
01:13:44,339 --> 01:13:48,819
Please go on.
- Then I saw her.

569
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:54,180
Between 1 0:30 and 1 1:00 on a boat.
I was on a Vaporetto.

570
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:57,900
She's here in Venice
with those two women.

571
01:14:00,381 --> 01:14:03,501
What is it, Mr. Baxter?

572
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:06,582
I do not understand.

573
01:14:07,182 --> 01:14:12,142
If she's in Venice,
surely she will get in touch with you.

574
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:15,903
If she can.

575
01:14:17,384 --> 01:14:19,904
What is it you fear?

576
01:14:28,145 --> 01:14:31,105
A killer
on the loose, the murderer...

577
01:14:33,986 --> 01:14:36,946
My wife is not a well woman.

578
01:14:39,027 --> 01:14:40,227
Yes.

579
01:14:41,787 --> 01:14:43,747
Yes, of course.

580
01:14:46,188 --> 01:14:49,148
I would have thought...

581
01:14:52,828 --> 01:14:58,388
there must be more.
- No, no. There is nothing more.

582
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:03,149
My wife got something
from these two women,

583
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:08,670
something that neither doctors nor I
could give her, something she needed,

584
01:15:09,111 --> 01:15:11,631
so she went with them.
Where?

585
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:14,831
Where I don't know. I was

586
01:15:15,272 --> 01:15:19,552
in the pensione last night,
where they lived. Today l,

587
01:15:19,992 --> 01:15:24,232
before I came here, I looked for it.
It's vanished.

588
01:15:29,314 --> 01:15:31,274
So now she's with them.

589
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:43,955
Why should one criticize you
for being worried?

590
01:15:44,396 --> 01:15:47,356
Thank you for talking to me.

591
01:15:47,956 --> 01:15:50,996
I am grateful.
- Okay, I'll be at the

592
01:15:51,477 --> 01:15:53,357
Palazzo Vendori.

593
01:15:54,237 --> 01:15:57,717
I want you to help me. Try again.

594
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:00,558
Try to find the pensione.

595
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:05,958
It will make me feel that we have
your cooperation in a real way.

596
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:13,359
I don't even know where to start.

597
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:17,240
Start from where
you saw them the last time.

598
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:19,681
Okay.

599
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:22,161
Good luck.
- Thank you.

600
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:24,041
Where did you say?

601
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:26,401
San Nicol?dei Mendicoli.

602
01:16:26,842 --> 01:16:28,562
Ah, yes.

603
01:16:37,763 --> 01:16:39,323
Pronto? Sabbione?

604
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:43,883
Follow Signor Baxter
from San Nicola church.

605
01:20:33,516 --> 01:20:34,716
Hello!

606
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:38,476
Is anyone here? Hello!

607
01:20:40,437 --> 01:20:44,677
Ah, hello Signora.
Do you speak English? - No.

608
01:20:45,118 --> 01:20:48,838
Two old ladies... Sisters...

609
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:52,238
One...
- Nina!

610
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:58,439
Hello, Signora. Two...
Do you speak English? - No.

611
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,600
Two old ladies...

612
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,640
Sisters. One...

613
01:21:06,081 --> 01:21:10,641
What's that called? So. Yes?

614
01:21:11,081 --> 01:21:13,921
Ah! Come along.
- Scottish women.

615
01:21:14,362 --> 01:21:17,322
They left this morning.
- A woman was with them.

616
01:21:17,762 --> 01:21:19,602
Yes. My wife.

617
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:22,003
Come along.

618
01:21:31,044 --> 01:21:33,204
But where are they?
- Gone.

619
01:21:34,245 --> 01:21:38,245
But where? - They left today.
Do you want this room?

620
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:41,125
Me? No, thank you.

621
01:21:53,407 --> 01:21:55,567
Where?
- I don't know. You?

622
01:21:56,008 --> 01:21:57,168
No.

623
01:21:57,608 --> 01:22:00,368
Excuse me. Thank you, Mr. Baxter.

624
01:22:00,808 --> 01:22:03,368
Who are you?
- Sabbione,

625
01:22:03,809 --> 01:22:06,049
Homicide.

626
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,130
They're not here.

627
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:26,252
Yes. Very nice!

628
01:22:30,933 --> 01:22:33,893
Yes, Signor?
- I'm expected. - Your name?

629
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:39,413
Baxter. John Baxter.
- Mr. Baxter! He's seeing people now.

630
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:43,814
I'll tell him that you are here.
- Thank you.

631
01:22:57,296 --> 01:23:00,256
Your Excellency,
Signor Baxter is here.

632
01:23:07,898 --> 01:23:11,858
Do we have the medical results?
- Yes, Excellency.

633
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:26,940
Sister... - He won't be long.
- I've to make a call to England.

634
01:23:27,381 --> 01:23:32,341
It's urgent. Could I use that phone?
- You'll have to complete this form.

635
01:23:38,422 --> 01:23:41,782
Can I dial that here?
- Yes.

636
01:23:47,903 --> 01:23:50,663
Pronto! To England, please.

637
01:24:01,105 --> 01:24:03,065
Mrs. Babbage? John Baxter.

638
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:05,346
Hello!
- Hello.

639
01:24:05,786 --> 01:24:08,026
I've been trying to ring you,

640
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:10,946
but the wire's down or something.

641
01:24:11,387 --> 01:24:14,227
Johnny's absolutely fine!

642
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:19,027
Quite right as rain. He woke up
this morning with no headache.

643
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:21,468
Fit as a fiddle! The doctor's

644
01:24:21,908 --> 01:24:26,588
let him get up,
and he's now playing around.

645
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:29,229
And it wasn't a concussion.

646
01:24:29,669 --> 01:24:32,949
Johnny can remember everthing.
- That's marvelous.

647
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:36,790
It's something they have to watch.
- Yes.

648
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:40,390
I suppose you'd like to speak
to your wife... - Sorry?

649
01:24:40,831 --> 01:24:41,951
Here she is.

650
01:24:43,071 --> 01:24:45,471
I...
- Hello, darling. What?

651
01:24:45,912 --> 01:24:48,632
Laura?
- Johnny's perfectly alright.

652
01:24:49,072 --> 01:24:51,432
There's nothing wrong,

653
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:55,672
absolutely nothing. He just has
this little bumb on his forehead.

654
01:24:56,113 --> 01:24:58,233
Are you alright? Where are you?

655
01:24:58,673 --> 01:25:03,993
I'm at Alberto's.
- I'm catching the 9 o'clock plane.

656
01:25:04,434 --> 01:25:08,994
I don't know what time it gets in,
but we can have a late dinner.

657
01:25:09,435 --> 01:25:11,555
Everything is very good.

658
01:25:11,995 --> 01:25:15,035
John's fine, and I'm okay.

659
01:25:15,476 --> 01:25:18,716
I thought I saw you here.
I thought I saw you

660
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:22,796
with the two sisters.
I was certain, I swear it!

661
01:25:23,237 --> 01:25:26,197
Alright, don't worry, sweetheart!

662
01:25:26,637 --> 01:25:30,637
I found the flight number.
- Laura, where are you?

663
01:25:31,078 --> 01:25:34,798
I'm at Porton, John!
Johnny and I just had tea.

664
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:40,198
It's arriving at 1 1:00.
- Just a second, I'll get a pencil.

665
01:25:40,799 --> 01:25:45,639
I'll come straight to Alberto's.
- Okay, I'll wait...

666
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:50,040
I'll see you about eleven, okay?
- Yes. - John, alright?

667
01:25:50,481 --> 01:25:53,441
Okay.
- John, Alright? - Yes.

668
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:57,841
I love you. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

669
01:26:01,082 --> 01:26:03,882
Let Jesus Christ

670
01:26:04,322 --> 01:26:09,602
lead your heart and spirit
down the right path.

671
01:26:10,043 --> 01:26:11,003
Amen.

672
01:26:15,244 --> 01:26:17,884
John! Are you feeling alright?

673
01:26:18,324 --> 01:26:21,964
Yes. Excuse me, Alberto.

674
01:26:22,405 --> 01:26:25,365
I think I just have to...

675
01:26:26,366 --> 01:26:29,086
May I use your telephone?
- Sure.

676
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:44,848
I don't blame you moving in here.
I would have done the same myself.

677
01:26:45,288 --> 01:26:50,408
Do you want to see Johnny again?
- No, thank you. I've said goodbye.

678
01:26:50,849 --> 01:26:54,809
Mrs. Baxter, I think
it would probably be quicker.

679
01:27:05,731 --> 01:27:08,371
Good evening.
- Where are the English women?

680
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:11,252
Up the stairs.

681
01:27:20,853 --> 01:27:22,053
Wendy?

682
01:27:23,094 --> 01:27:24,294
Answer me!

683
01:27:26,654 --> 01:27:30,054
It's me, John Baxter.
Laura's husband.

684
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:33,295
What's happened to Wendy?
Where is she?

685
01:27:33,735 --> 01:27:35,895
I don't know, I'll find out.

686
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:39,455
I don't know what's happening.
- Yes, I know.

687
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:43,456
Where is the other?
- At the British Consulate.

688
01:27:43,896 --> 01:27:46,016
She was very furious.

689
01:27:47,297 --> 01:27:52,257
She's at the British Consulate.
- Yes, but that was hours ago!

690
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:57,098
It's half past nine now.
I don't know this room.

691
01:27:57,538 --> 01:28:00,058
I want to go home to the hotel.

692
01:28:01,899 --> 01:28:05,179
This is a Police Station.
I don't want to stay here.

693
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:09,659
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
There was a misunderstanding...

694
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:13,900
They took us out of our hotel.
We were arrested.

695
01:28:14,341 --> 01:28:19,141
Then they asked us about your wife...
- I know. I'm truly sorry.

696
01:28:19,581 --> 01:28:22,261
I'm taking you back now.
- Yes, please.

697
01:28:22,702 --> 01:28:24,422
May she?
- Yes.

698
01:28:24,862 --> 01:28:28,822
If I could just take your arm?
- Sure.

699
01:28:32,623 --> 01:28:37,263
You can't understand the noises
in a place like this.

700
01:28:37,864 --> 01:28:41,584
I'm so sorry. I just feel that...

701
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:45,225
If you could just take me back.

702
01:29:12,909 --> 01:29:14,869
Signora Baxter?
- Yes.

703
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:18,869
More luggage?
- No. You send by Barberigo? - Yes.

704
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:22,750
Okay. Do you speak English?
- A little.

705
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:27,991
In Venice I love that
it's so safe for me to walk.

706
01:29:28,431 --> 01:29:31,391
Watch, steps.
- Thank you.

707
01:29:32,752 --> 01:29:36,672
The sound changes, you see,
as you come to a canal,

708
01:29:37,112 --> 01:29:41,072
and the echoes from the walls
are so clear.

709
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:45,753
My sister hates it.
- That's too bad.

710
01:29:46,994 --> 01:29:50,714
She says it's like a city in aspic,

711
01:29:51,154 --> 01:29:55,874
left over from a dinner party,
and all the guests are dead and gone.

712
01:29:56,915 --> 01:30:00,875
It frightens her. Too many shadows.

713
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:06,876
We are almost there.
- Yes.

714
01:30:08,877 --> 01:30:12,677
Milton loved this city.
Did you know that?

715
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:15,077
No. It's interesting.

716
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:26,039
This isn't the right way, is it?

717
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:30,079
The Palazzo di Conte Barberigo.
- Yes, yes.

718
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,000
This is the wrong way!
- I'm taking you to Signor Baxter.

719
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,360
Yes?
- He is at the Police Station.

720
01:30:38,801 --> 01:30:41,241
It is just along the way.

721
01:30:53,203 --> 01:30:56,763
I've tried to keep them.
They never stay.

722
01:30:57,204 --> 01:30:59,684
They're very wild in Venice.

723
01:31:01,204 --> 01:31:04,164
Do you like cats, Mr. Baxter?
- Yes.

724
01:31:04,925 --> 01:31:09,605
I like them alright,
but they don't like me very much.

725
01:31:10,045 --> 01:31:12,485
Here's the hotel.
- Thank you.

726
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:15,046
These are swinging doors.
- I remember.

727
01:31:15,486 --> 01:31:19,766
I'll keep them open.
- It's so reassuring to have a man.

728
01:31:20,207 --> 01:31:24,567
We changed hotels cause Wendy said
there were prowlers. And it was dirty.

729
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:29,608
Careful of the steps.
- Thank you.

730
01:31:30,408 --> 01:31:33,088
Here is the key.
- Thank you.

731
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:35,969
Room 307.
- 307, good.

732
01:31:38,489 --> 01:31:40,929
Okay, it's here.

733
01:31:47,211 --> 01:31:52,691
They said you left at the station.
- Mr. Baxter's been looking after me.

734
01:31:53,051 --> 01:31:56,171
Has he?
- Yes, she was at the Police Station,

735
01:31:56,612 --> 01:31:59,572
and had been there quite a while
and I thought...

736
01:32:00,732 --> 01:32:04,092
They found your wife then?
- Yes... the killings...

737
01:32:04,533 --> 01:32:09,493
He's explained everything. Have we a
drop of Whisky for him? You'll stay?

738
01:32:09,934 --> 01:32:12,934
Yes.
- There's the miniatures.

739
01:32:13,614 --> 01:32:16,214
We're leaving tomorrow.

740
01:32:16,655 --> 01:32:19,735
Have you put the photographs out?
- Yes.

741
01:32:20,175 --> 01:32:22,655
Just a glass of water for me.

742
01:32:23,096 --> 01:32:27,056
I'll fetch it.
Do take a seat, Mr. Baxter.

743
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:45,218
So you can find it quite easily.

744
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:46,859
Thank you.

745
01:32:49,299 --> 01:32:50,259
Thank you.

746
01:32:51,379 --> 01:32:54,099
Doesn't really look like her.
- It doesn't matter.

747
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,980
No?
- No.

748
01:32:59,461 --> 01:33:02,501
Please, your photograph.

749
01:33:03,421 --> 01:33:04,381
What?

750
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,222
My God!

751
01:33:10,462 --> 01:33:14,422
Thank you for your help. Bye-bye.

752
01:33:14,863 --> 01:33:16,823
Goodbye.

753
01:33:34,506 --> 01:33:35,466
Thank you.

754
01:33:35,906 --> 01:33:38,866
You're wearing odd socks.
- You put out my clothes.

755
01:33:39,306 --> 01:33:41,506
I know. I was merely informing you.
- Thank you.

756
01:33:42,347 --> 01:33:46,587
I must go... - You've been wearing
them all day. - Let him be off.

757
01:33:47,027 --> 01:33:51,347
Wait! - Is there anything I can do?
- No, it's alright. Goodbye.

758
01:33:51,788 --> 01:33:54,708
She'll be alright.

759
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:03,909
Wait!

760
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,790
Fetch him back!
- Wait!

761
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:11,630
Please, please, fetch him back!

762
01:34:24,272 --> 01:34:27,792
Please, fetch him back!

763
01:34:29,153 --> 01:34:31,193
Get him back!

764
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:33,954
Fetch him! Fetch him!

765
01:34:37,634 --> 01:34:39,594
Get him!

766
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,715
Get him back!

767
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,677
Mr. Baxter!

768
01:34:59,117 --> 01:35:00,917
Mr. Baxter!

769
01:35:01,358 --> 01:35:03,318
Mr. Baxter?

770
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,640
Hello, is John here?
- Quickly, come quickly!

771
01:35:23,081 --> 01:35:25,801
What is it?

772
01:35:33,362 --> 01:35:35,882
Hurry!
- Is this it?

773
01:35:36,323 --> 01:35:40,363
Mrs. Baxter...
- Is it Heather? - Please.

774
01:35:40,803 --> 01:35:43,523
Mrs. Baxter.
- Where is he? - I couldn't find him.

775
01:35:43,964 --> 01:35:47,124
I saw Christine!
- He left.

776
01:35:47,924 --> 01:35:52,804
Find him! You must warn him!
- Get him back!

777
01:35:53,245 --> 01:35:56,365
She told you to leave.
- Where did he go? - I don't know.

778
01:35:56,805 --> 01:36:00,125
She told you to leave.
- Where did he go?

779
01:36:00,566 --> 01:36:04,086
She told you to leave Venice!
She told you...

780
01:36:04,527 --> 01:36:06,647
Beware!

781
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:28,289
Laura! Mrs. Baxter!

782
01:36:53,453 --> 01:36:57,333
Come here! With the boat. Up here!

783
01:36:58,294 --> 01:37:01,414
No, with the boat! Wait!

784
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:10,536
Wait!

785
01:37:13,656 --> 01:37:14,896
Ugly monster!

786
01:37:16,057 --> 01:37:19,577
When I catch you, I'll kill you!

787
01:37:20,017 --> 01:37:22,457
Where do you go?

788
01:37:23,018 --> 01:37:25,778
Hold her!

789
01:37:26,218 --> 01:37:27,178
Run!

790
01:37:33,059 --> 01:37:35,539
You piece of shit!

791
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:36,196
It's alright. Everything's okay.
I'm a friend.

792
01:39:37,716 --> 01:39:38,996
I'm coming.

793
01:39:53,879 --> 01:39:56,359
She is possessed by the devil!

794
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,720
It's okay.

795
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,640
I'm a friend.

796
01:40:10,201 --> 01:40:12,001
I won't hurt you.

797
01:40:14,362 --> 01:40:15,562
