Did she die suddenly?
她笑着抬起头。
她死得很突然？

在这之前我一直吸烟。
现在我还没有一根香烟。

as if he knew
something was going to happen.

back for our entertainment.

and finally through these two women
I've discovered how!
最终通过这两个女人
我终于找到了解决的方式。

They used that very word.
她们也反对巫术

00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,898
Of course they do!
- They just want to help!
她们当然会这么做
- 她们只是想帮忙。

00:40:18,338 --> 00:40:22,138
Laura, do you not see...
- She's going to try and reach her.
劳拉，你不明白...

Now listen to me.
劳拉，够了。
现在听我说。

the children play where they want to.
我已经在听你说的了。
你说过让孩子在他们想去的地方玩。

- Thanks for the memories.
你让她去池塘的附近，
- 感谢回忆。

You said you'd give your life
in exchange for hers. Well you can't.
你说过你愿意用你的生命去换回她
可是你不能那样做。

313
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:53,543
Jesus H. Christ.
- John!
耶稣基督
- 约翰！

00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:59,463
She's trying to get in touch with us!
Maybe to forgive!
她在尝试联系我们
可能会原谅我们的（疏忽大意）。

00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,864
Go, go on to your crazy women.
They can have their victim.
去吧，继续和你的疯女人在一起
