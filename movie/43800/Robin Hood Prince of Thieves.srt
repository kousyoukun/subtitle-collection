1
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,360
Show them the courage of Allah!

2
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,160
He says you stole the bread.

3
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
It's a lie.

4
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,720
I caught him stealing ours.

5
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,800
Cut off the infidel's hand.

6
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
I took it!

7
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,440
That's not true.

8
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,720
They're not interested in truth.

9
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,240
But he's lying!

10
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
You're too weak to survive it.

11
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,160
As you wish.

12
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,360
Cut the other's hand off too.

13
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Robin.

14
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,880
This is English courage.

15
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
That's for 5 years of hell!

16
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Behind you!

17
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,080
Come on, for God's sake!

18
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,320
Take us with you!

19
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,520
You can't save those people!

20
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
But you can save me!

21
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,360
Christian!

22
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,600
-Why should l?
-For pity's sake.

23
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,360
Mine is a sentence of death.

24
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,000
-He's a Moor! Don't listen!
-Set me free! I'll show you a way out.

25
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,640
-Why should we?
-lf you do not, we are all dead men.

26
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,520
No, Robin, for God's
sake! They're coming!

27
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm sorry.

28
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,800
This way!

29
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Thanks. I misjudged you.

30
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,280
You are fast with a sword.

31
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,440
I waited 5 years to smell free
air. That makes a man fast.

32
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,920
It's mortal.

33
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,120
Leave me.

34
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,640
Give this to my sister, Marian.

35
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,840
Now swear you'll protect her.

36
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,800
His wound is by the
heart. We cannot save him.

37
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,720
Swear it, Robin!

38
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,440
I swear it.

39
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,480
Tell Marian I died a free Englishman.

40
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,160
Come, my friend. Make his
sacrifice an act of honor.

41
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,400
Come!

42
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Why did you cut me free?

43
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,680
Whatever blood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

44
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,360
Farewell, friend.

45
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,640
God speed your way.

46
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,840
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

47
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,600
You saved my life.

48
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,240
I vow to stay with
you until I save yours.

49
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,000
But I go to England. I
relieve you of your obligation.

50
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
Only Allah can do that.

51
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,920
What if I say no?

52
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
You have no choice.

53
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,960
I am Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir.

54
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,160
You may call me Azeem.

55
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,440
Robin of Locksley.

56
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
Kindest sir...

57
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,560
...it is rumored you fought
in King Richard's Crusade...

58
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,040
...with my beloved son Robin.

59
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,800
I fear you have returned
home to desperate times...

60
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,520
...when dark forces plot
against our absent king.

61
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,560
I am anxious for word of my son.

62
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,920
Were you present at his
capture near Jerusalem?

63
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
Do you know which potentate holds him?

64
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,920
Does he still bear me ill will?

65
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,720
A little news, please, sir.

66
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,960
I would give all I own for his release.

67
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,240
Help me!

68
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,120
You should have waited!

69
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.

70
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,400
It's all right. Let him go.

71
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,480
They've taken my Gwen. My daughter!

72
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,720
Who?

73
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,640
Men! On horses. In masks.

74
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
We tried to stop them!

75
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
My son...is dead!

76
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,840
Master, stay. There is
an evil moon tonight.

77
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,680
Never fear, Duncan. Good will overcome.

78
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
Trust in that.

79
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
I'm sorry, my lord. I had no choice.

80
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
You!

81
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,760
The King shall hear of this!

82
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
Join us.

83
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,200
Never.

84
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
Join us...

85
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
...or die.

86
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,760
God and King Richard!

87
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,880
Thank you, Lord.

88
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,320
I'm home!

89
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm home!

90
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,360
You are strange, Christian.

91
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,200
But I'm free!

92
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
I beg you to free yourself of your vow.

93
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,280
Return with the boat.

94
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,480
I know how it feels to be
far from home and family.

95
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,880
Because I love them so
much I cannot dishonor them.

96
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
I thought you'd say that.

97
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,760
No man controls my destiny.

98
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,520
Especially not one who attacks
downwind and stinks of garlic.

99
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Come!

100
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
Our fighting days are done.

101
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,080
By nightfall, we'll
celebrate with my father.

102
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,840
You understand, of course...

103
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
...I had to try.

104
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,080
I would have succeeded.

105
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,720
Why must you walk in back of me?

106
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
In your country, am I not the infidel?

107
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,880
It seems safer to appear as your
slave rather than your equal.

108
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
For an infidel you have
uncommon clarity of thinking.

109
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
Tell me of yourself.

110
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,240
Your name, Azeem. What does it mean?

111
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,840
Great One.

112
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,960
Really? Did you give yourself this name?

113
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
It's a joke!

114
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,000
Azeem the Great One, I am home!

115
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,360
Look!

116
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,600
Mistletoe!

117
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,080
Many a maid lost her
resolve to me thanks to this!

118
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,520
In my country, we talk to our women.

119
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
We do not drug them with plants.

120
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,360
What do you know of women?

121
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,800
Where I come from, Christian...

122
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,120
...there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man's mind so...

123
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,760
...that he would willingly die for them.

124
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait. Is that why you
were to be executed?

125
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
Because of a woman?

126
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,640
That's it, isn't it?

127
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,840
That's it!

128
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
It is close to sunset.

129
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,240
You painted old dog! Who was she?

130
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,560
The Mullah's daughter?

131
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,680
Another man's wife?

132
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,720
What's her name?

133
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,960
Is there no sun in this cursed country?!

134
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
Which way east?

135
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
-Her name?
-East!

136
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,320
Her name?

137
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,640
Jasmina.

138
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,320
That way.

139
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
You are sure?

140
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,400
I'd know blindfolded.
I'm five miles from home.

141
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,800
Was she worth it?

142
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
Worth dying for.

143
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,240
You're dog's meat, son!

144
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,720
You're not playing by the rules.

145
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,520
Deer don't climb trees.

146
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,840
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

147
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,160
Shall we teach him to fly?

148
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,960
Cut it down.

149
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,280
Hold!

150
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,680
What manner of creature is so
fearsome it takes six men to attack it?

151
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,680
Stand down. It's no affair of yours.

152
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,520
Have we treed the devil?

153
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,640
Let's see.

154
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,120
A small boy, a truly dangerous animal.

155
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,360
This boy killed the Sheriff
of Nottingham's deer.

156
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,600
You starve us! We needed meat.

157
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,680
I advise you to move on.
This is the Sheriff's land.

158
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,840
Wrong.

159
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,920
It's my land and my tree.

160
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,960
Whatever's in it belongs to me.

161
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,520
Might I have the pleasure of your
name before I have you run through?

162
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,200
Robin of Locksley.

163
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,880
Welcome home.

164
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,640
Kill him!

165
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,440
Time to redeem that vow!

166
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
Unleash the hounds!

167
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,840
Get off your damn knees!

168
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
Be so kind as to give me your
name before I run you through.

169
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,120
Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's cousin.

170
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,040
That bastard poached deer.

171
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,600
Poach?

172
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,200
Isn't it a greater
crime to starve a family?

173
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,080
Go on, Locksley.

174
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,440
Go on.

175
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,040
I've seen enough blood
spilt to last two lifetimes.

176
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
Get off my land.

177
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,840
Tell Nottingham what happens
when his scum pick on children.

178
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,320
You travel 10,000 miles to save my
life then leave me to be butchered?!

179
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,120
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

180
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,920
Which does not include prayer times...

181
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,240
...or anytime I'm outnumbered 6 to 1!

182
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
You whine like a mule.

183
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,040
You are still alive.

184
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,720
Have no fear. Come down.

185
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Is it true? Did you kill a deer?

186
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,040
Hundreds.

187
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
You scared him.

188
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,080
Interesting place, this...

189
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
...England.

190
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,560
The Sheriff's not to be disturbed.

191
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Cousin!

192
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,880
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

193
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,640
I met a hooded man today who bade
me warn you not to harm his people.

194
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,480
Who told you to cover up?

195
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,360
His name?

196
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,200
Robin of Locksley.

197
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,080
The prodigal son returns.

198
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,840
He's a whelp! This girl could best him.

199
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,560
Put it there!

200
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,240
This "whelp" bested four of my men.

201
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,200
Your men were probably drunk.

202
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,040
Yet you survived, cousin.

203
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,080
I barely survived.

204
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,880
His companion is dark-skinned,
with a marked face of lslam.

205
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,840
He carries a Saracen sword.

206
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm sure it would take an
army to match these rogues.

207
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,480
I trust Locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning.

208
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Father?

209
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,320
Father! Anyone here?

210
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,160
Duncan!

211
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Father!

212
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Who is it?

213
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,240
My father.

214
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,760
Who's there?

215
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,240
Who's there?

216
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,160
Master Robin?

217
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,640
Is that you?

218
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,240
Duncan?

219
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,960
Praise be! I thought God...

220
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,320
...had abandoned us.

221
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,000
Duncan,
my father--

222
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
It's a miracle!

223
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Why didn't you cut him down?

224
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,720
Are you deaf?!

225
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
Easy!

226
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Look at him.

227
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
I would have done if I could see.

228
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,440
Who did this to you?

229
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,320
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

230
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,040
The Sheriff and his witch watched.

231
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,680
Why?

232
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,520
They say the Sheriff captured
your father worshipping the devil.

233
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,680
That he signed a confession
before the Bishop.

234
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,880
That's not possible.

235
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,440
Nottingham declared all
Locksley lands forfeit.

236
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,640
Did you believe the charges?

237
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,160
Not even when they took my eyes.

238
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,920
We must go.

239
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,400
He loved you to the end.

240
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,520
He never gave up hope of your return.

241
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,160
I should have been here.

242
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,720
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

243
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,800
He said it was vanity to
force others to our religion.

244
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,840
But you must flee now.

245
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Head south. Gisborne
will surely seek revenge.

246
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,960
I hear you, Duncan.

247
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
You should go home.

248
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,000
My world is turned upside down here.

249
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,600
I cannot ask you to come with me.

250
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,120
Alone, Christian, you will
only get yourself killed.

251
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,360
Besides...

252
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,560
...there is nothing left
for me to go home to.

253
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,880
I will not rest until
my father is avenged!

254
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,960
I swear it...

255
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,880
...by my own blood.

256
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Mortianna?

257
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,720
You called, madam?

258
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,160
What do you see?

259
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,440
-The son of a dead man.
-Locksley!

260
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,280
Does he affect us?

261
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,960
He precedes the Lionheart.

262
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,120
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
It would soften the barons' spines.

263
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,920
-Soon?
-Make haste.

264
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,800
But my plan is still intact?

265
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,120
What's wrong?

266
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,280
I have seen our death.

267
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,440
The painted man! He haunts my dreams.

268
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,000
Adorned with strange foreign markings.

269
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,400
Locksley's companion.

270
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,960
Kill him.

271
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,320
Kill them both.

272
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,480
What is this place?

273
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,240
Peter's home.

274
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,120
It's six years since we left together.

275
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,080
We'll find food and shelter here.

276
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,280
No beggars!

277
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,920
Tell the mistress Robin
of Locksley's at her door.

278
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,080
Her ladyship's not here.

279
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,960
Is the child Marian in?

280
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,120
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

281
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,680
The hospitality here is
as warm as the weather.

282
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,000
-It's a joke.
-Really?

283
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,880
Leave your weapons.

284
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,320
Just you!

285
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,200
Wait here.

286
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Right here?

287
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,520
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

288
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,520
Were it not for their ungodly ways
Master Robin would never have left.

289
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,680
What manner of name is "Azeem?"

290
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,560
Irish? Cornish?

291
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,880
Moorish.

292
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,240
Who are you?

293
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,120
Robin of Locksley.

294
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,920
You lie. Robin is dead.

295
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,560
Step into the light.

296
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,000
Turn around.

297
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,840
Am I to dance next?

298
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,080
Who are you?

299
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,680
I am the maid Marian.

300
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,280
Show yourself, for we
knew each other well.

301
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,440
The years have been...

302
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,720
...kind.

303
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Thank you.

304
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,600
We must guard against outlaws who
would kidnap a relative of the King.

305
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,280
You can see I am not one of those.

306
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,960
Perhaps.

307
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,840
Now remove yourself from here.

308
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,640
I would, but I'm sworn to protect you.

309
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,120
Protect me?

310
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,400
Robin of Locksley was
nothing but a spoiled bully.

311
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,000
Besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

312
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,360
Marian, wait!

313
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,120
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

314
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,720
Point me toward danger! I'm ready!

315
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,160
Hello, Marian.

316
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,720
His last thoughts were of you.

317
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,360
Oh, Peter!

318
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,440
I'm sorry, Marian.

319
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,120
How do I know you didn't
abandon him to save yourself?

321
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,840
No one feels his loss more than l.

322
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,600
Next time I'm in London, I'll
give my mother your condolences.

323
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,160
I would think for your
safety you would join her.

324
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,040
I have no interest in life at court.

325
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,000
All gossip-mongering
and currying favor.

326
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,080
But you're alone here.

327
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,120
Hardly.

328
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,960
These years have left us many in need.

329
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,400
While you played hero,
Nottingham plundered the shire.

330
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,000
You still have your lands.

331
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,240
I give them no excuse to take them.

332
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,160
I am the king's cousin. I
must look after these people.

333
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,320
My purpose in coming
was not to hurt you.

334
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,120
I swore to your brother
I would protect you.

335
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,080
You cannot replace my brother.

336
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,440
I don't want to replace him.

337
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,000
I return to find my home
destroyed and my father murdered.

338
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,720
The only explanations for it are
the ramblings of an old, blind man.

339
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,840
All I remember of you
is a spoiled bully...

340
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,520
..who used to burn my hair as a child.

341
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,520
Please allow that war and
prison may change a man.

342
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,600
Whatever happened between you
and your father, don't believe...

343
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,320
...what they accused him of.

344
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,040
I don't.

345
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,120
Look!

346
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,880
How did your uneducated
kind ever take Jerusalem?

347
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,760
God knows.

348
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,960
What is it?

349
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,120
-What is it?
-Nottingham's soldiers.

350
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,240
Here? Is this your protection?

351
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,120
I killed some of the Sheriff's men.

352
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,440
I fear I have placed you in danger.

353
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
I can take care of myself. Just go!

354
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,520
No, that's my horse!

355
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,920
A magnificent animal!

356
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,920
-Go!
-I said I'm sworn to protect you.

357
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,440
I say no more boyish gestures.

358
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,120
I'm not leaving.

359
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,560
Stop them! They're stealing my horses!

360
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,520
You're so kind.

361
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,960
Sheltering outlaws?

362
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
They're thieves.

363
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,480
Lucky he didn't steal your virtue.

364
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,640
A crown to the man who
brings me Locksley's head!

365
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,480
Have we lost them?

366
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,440
No!

367
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,320
My horse carries two. Yours
is lame. We can't outrun them.

368
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,280
Leave me, Master Robin!
I slow your escape.

369
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,200
We'll hide in the forest.

370
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,040
Sherwood Forest is haunted.

371
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,880
We take our chances with ghosts,
or become ghosts ourselves.

372
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,920
Come on!

373
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
It's only 3 men!

374
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,120
It's not the men we fear.

375
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,360
It's the evil spirits.

376
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,280
Robin of the Hood!

377
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
Son of a devil worshipper!

378
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,040
Your father died a coward...

379
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,960
...cursing you and
squealing like a stuck pig!

380
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,280
You'll bring no justice
to your father by dying.

381
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,000
There are your ghosts.

382
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,640
Wind chimes.

383
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,280
A child's toy put to good use.

384
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,080
You scare easily, my painted Moor.

385
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,000
This forest has eyes.

386
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,880
I swear it.

387
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,760
In my dreams alone have
I imagined such a place.

388
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,720
Then imagine a way to cross it.

389
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,240
There's hope!

390
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,400
There was a rich man from Nottingham
Who tried to cross the river

391
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,880
What a dope He tripped on a rope

392
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,960
Now look at him shiver!

393
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,840
Beg for mercy, rich man!

394
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,760
I beg of no man.

395
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,000
This is our river, and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax.

396
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,880
I will pay no tax.

397
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,520
As you can see, I have nothing.

398
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,800
Not even my sword.

399
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,400
Bollocks!

400
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,600
Any man who travels with two servants...

401
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,040
...and claims he's got no
bloody money is either...

402
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,440
...a fool or a liar.

403
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,360
Yeah, he's a liar!

404
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,120
Who are you?

405
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,120
John Little...

406
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,160
...best man of the woods.

407
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,520
Well, best man, you lead this rabble?

408
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,880
Yes, I do, mate.

409
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,960
And if you want to travel through
Sherwood Forest, it'll cost you...

410
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
...that gold medallion.

411
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,040
It's sacred to me.

412
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,880
It's sacred to us too, matey.

413
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,640
It will feed us for a month.

414
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,640
You must fight me for it.

415
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,880
Love to, mate.

416
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,280
Be careful, Father.

417
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,960
He walloped 12 of the Sheriff's men.

418
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,240
Is that so?

419
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,240
Reckon I'll enjoy this.

420
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
He's your father?

421
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,600
He's drowning!

422
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,880
Lost something?

423
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,080
Thanks for the taxes.

424
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,240
The rich boy's lost for words!

425
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,080
Any great ideas?

426
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,600
Get up! Move faster!

427
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,400
Move faster. Great idea.

428
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,520
We're not through yet.

429
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,160
All right, my old cocker.

430
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,640
You want another good walloping?

431
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,320
You'll have it.

432
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,800
I've made it past the gate, John Little.

433
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,280
Or should I call you Little John?

434
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,760
Swimming time again, old chum.

435
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,440
Where is he? Do you see him?

436
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,320
It's a blooming shame!

437
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,840
He was a brave lad!

438
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,800
-Do you yield?
-I can't bloody swim!

439
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,880
-Do you yield?!
-Yes!

440
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,960
Good. Now put your feet down.

441
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,760
I'll be buggered!

442
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,480
-The medallion.
-Give me your name first.

443
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,920
Robin of Locksley.

444
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,480
Well, Robin
of Locksley--

445
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,680
You got balls of solid rock. Come on.

446
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,840
That's Much the Miller's
son, Harold Brownwell.

447
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
That stumpy one is David of
Doncaster, but the lads call him Bull.

448
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,080
Because you're short?

449
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,400
It's because I'm so long!

450
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,120
Save it!

451
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,800
Save it for the ladies.

452
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,960
Give him mead.

453
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,480
I made that myself.

454
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,560
Has English hospitality
changed so in 6 years...

455
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,440
...that a friend of mine's not welcome?

456
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,520
But he's a savage, sire!

457
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,640
That he is.

458
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,800
But no more than you or l.

459
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,520
And don't call me sire.

460
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,120
With regret, I must decline.

461
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,240
Allah forbids it.

462
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,000
Your loss!

463
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,560
Why are so many of you in hiding?

464
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,480
We're all outlaws.

465
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,320
Got prices on our heads.

466
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,080
Even the lad.

467
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,520
We've a blasted Sheriff,
he says we owe him taxes.

468
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,280
Your ghost will only keep
his men at bay so long.

469
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,720
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

470
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,920
We can fight back.

471
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,160
Did I crack your noble head?

472
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,560
These are all good lads here...

473
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,400
...with hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

474
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,200
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

475
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,520
They say the Sheriff
was raised by a witch.

476
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,880
She knows every man's thoughts.

477
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,000
-She flies.
-That's codswallop!

478
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,760
The rich son of a devil worshipper...

479
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,080
...cares what happens
to outlaw peasants?

480
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,040
My lord was kind and generous!

481
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,640
Who dares believe
him capable--

482
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,720
My father was no devil worshipper.

483
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,720
And I'll have words with
any who say otherwise.

484
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,960
But he's right.

485
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,240
I was a rich man's son.

486
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,720
But I killed the Sheriff's men.

487
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,120
I'm an outlaw like you.

488
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,760
You are nothing like us.

489
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,160
That's Will Scarlet.

490
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,160
Take no notice. He's
full of piss and wind.

491
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,040
Come on, drink up.

492
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,200
Stop talking so much rubbish.

493
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,760
This is the best we
simple men can expect.

494
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,680
Here we're safe.

495
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,000
Here we are kings.

496
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,440
Too much mead, friend?

497
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,680
Forgive me, I oversleep.

498
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,600
Rest yourself.

499
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,280
What day is it?

500
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,080
Sunday, I think.

501
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,200
Do they still give alms
to the poor at Mass?

502
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,760
That they do.

503
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,240
Now the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

504
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,560
We beseech Thy blessing, Lord...

505
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,400
...on all Your people,
but most especially...

506
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,480
...on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

507
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,240
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

508
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,200
...our glorious city.

509
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,040
Grant him also the strength...

510
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,280
...to bring to justice
the lawless men...

511
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,840
...who would threaten its safety...

512
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,040
...and prosperity... and the judgment...

513
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,880
...to punish them...

514
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,760
...in Your name. Amen.

515
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,680
Go in peace.

516
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,480
That's all I have.

517
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,840
Alms for a blind man, my lady?

518
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,600
For one who cannot see your beauty?

519
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,440
What are you doing here?

520
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,040
Searching my soul.

521
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,440
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

522
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,040
You prefer Nottingham's company?

523
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,520
There's a price on your head.

524
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,760
One hundred gold pieces.

525
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,360
Is that all?

526
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,960
I shall have to annoy the Sheriff more.

527
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,640
Soon it will be a thousand.

528
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,840
For a thousand, I'd turn you in myself.

529
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,720
Nottingham is mounting an army.

530
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,800
He has every blacksmith in the
county making swords and armor.

531
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,040
-What's his plan?
-I don't know.

532
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,600
There's no limit to his ambitions.

533
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,520
-Thank you.
-Quickly. Go!

534
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,520
Do something for me.

535
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,360
Take a bath.

536
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,560
A bath?

537
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,600
These are my private chambers, my son.

538
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,160
I have priests who would
hear your confession.

539
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,920
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

540
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,960
Welcome home, Robin.

541
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,640
You shine like the sun, my lady.

542
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,920
You've been meeting with Robin.

543
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,240
My cousin tells me the knave
deprived you of some horses.

544
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,280
Yes, a most disagreeable experience.

545
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,920
And for inflicting that upon you...

546
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,840
...I'll hang him from
the walls by his entrails.

547
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,040
I'd like to see it.

548
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,120
If you'd bring your household within
the city, I could attend to your needs.

549
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,120
Thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

550
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,760
Then perhaps you'd do me the honor...

551
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,040
...of accepting a token of my
undying devotion to your safety.

552
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,040
King Richard will be moved to hear
of your concern for my welfare.

553
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm afraid the king has many
enemies abroad and at home.

554
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,480
I fear for his safe return.

555
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,120
Fear not, dear Sheriff. He will return.

556
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,240
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

557
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,720
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one.

558
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,520
Because his answer
vexed me so grievously.

559
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,720
He said...

560
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,360
...he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

561
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,960
You lie!

562
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,040
On your souls, do not shed
blood in the house of God!

563
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Locksley!

564
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,320
I'll cut your heart out...

565
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,080
...with a spoon!

566
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,000
Then it begins.

567
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,480
Close that gate!

568
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,880
What are you looking at?!

569
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Water!

570
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,160
-Thank you.
-For the animal.

571
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,120
How can I protect you if
I know not where you go?

572
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,840
You hardly raise a
finger when you do know...

573
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,120
...Great One.

574
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,680
I prefer to have the choice.

575
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,640
You've stolen the Sheriff's horse?

576
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,640
You've stirred up a hornet's nest now!

577
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,520
-Are you afraid?
-Yeah, a little.

578
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,520
So is the Sheriff. And today I
gave him a sting he'll not forget.

579
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,920
You fool! You started a war!

580
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,840
We're already at war.

581
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,720
Bread.

582
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,840
I say we strike back at the
very man who takes our homes...

583
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,720
...and hunts our children.

584
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,200
You planning to join us?

585
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
No, to lead you.

586
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,840
These are simple people.

587
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,920
They are not warriors.

588
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,480
Be careful you do not do
this for your own purposes.

589
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,320
You forget yourself. I do not
ask for your company or council.

590
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,280
Why a spoon, cousin? Why not an axe?

591
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,280
Because it's dull, you
twit! It'll hurt more!

592
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,360
I want this brigand found.

593
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,760
Starve them out!

594
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,560
Slaughter them! No,
take their livestock.

595
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,840
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

596
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,720
Perhaps we could create a name for him.

597
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,600
Something to drive
fear into the populace.

598
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,280
Maybe Locksley the
Lethal or Wreaking Robin.

599
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,440
I want him dead by the full
moon, before the barons come back.

600
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,400
Now, sew!

601
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,920
And keep the stitches small.

602
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,280
He's not here.

603
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,320
Where's your mate,
the man called Little?

604
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,040
-He died last winter.
-Burn it down!

605
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,320
Leave the sow. Her young
will feed us through winter.

606
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,520
You heard of the Sherwood Bandit?

607
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,480
Robin of the Hood? Yes.

608
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,280
Pray he is brought to us before winter.

609
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,520
He's there!

610
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,040
Look what they've done!

611
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,840
If it's fame you seek, Christian...

612
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,400
...I think you have it.

613
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,120
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

614
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,440
Nottingham tries to divide us.

615
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,040
We are divided, rich boy.

616
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,000
I'm not blind as that old man.

617
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,000
You're still trying to
be lord of the manor.

618
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,920
I heard the Sheriff values your neck...

619
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,120
...at five hundred gold pieces.

620
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,400
I say we take him in.

621
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,240
You think the Sheriff will give
everything back after I'm gone?

622
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,040
He'll give us the
reward and our pardons.

623
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,160
Wrong!

624
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,920
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

625
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,360
What would you have us do?

626
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,720
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and bare hands?

627
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,120
If needs be.

628
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,480
But with the one true
weapon that escapes you.

629
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,160
Courage.

630
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,360
Thank you, Wulf.

631
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,240
You wish to end this?

632
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,880
To go home?

633
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,000
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves...

634
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,680
...and face that the price may be dear.

635
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,240
I would rather die...

636
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,480
...than stay in hiding.

637
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,400
The Sheriff calls us outlaws.

638
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,920
But I say we are free.

639
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,200
And one free man defending
his home is more powerful...

640
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,640
...than ten hired soldiers.

641
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,160
Crusades taught me that.

642
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,480
I'll make no promises save one.

643
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,600
If you truly believe in
your heart you are free...

644
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,520
...then we can win.

645
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,160
They got armor!

646
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,200
They got armor, Bull?

647
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,880
Even this boy can learn to
find the chinks in armor.

648
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,760
But we ain't got no food!

649
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,800
What do we need that the forest
cannot provide? We have food.

650
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,560
Wood for weapons.

651
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,600
We'll find safety in the trees.

652
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,400
What about our kin?

653
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,200
Sheriff took all they got!

654
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,160
Then, by God, we take it back.

655
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,760
What's the meaning of this?

656
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,720
A woman of your beauty has
no need for such decorations.

657
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,880
How dare you!

658
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,160
Please don't take that! Don't take that!

659
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,280
They belong to our Lord.

660
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,320
Now they belong to my Lord Sheriff!

661
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,600
Give it back!

662
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,440
Good.

663
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,440
Tell the Sheriff for every harm he does
these people I will repay him tenfold.

664
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,360
Something vexes thee?

665
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,560
What the devil?

666
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,720
It's a hot day, friend...

667
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,080
...to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse.

668
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,280
The Sheriff will hear of this!

669
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,280
I truly hope so.

670
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,240
Buy yourself a new sow.

671
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,960
God bless you, Fanny.

672
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,320
And God bless Robin Hood!

673
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,640
We reckon he's nicked...

674
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,880
...three to four million
in the last five months.

675
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,880
Raise the bounty on his head.

676
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,680
25,000 crowns.

677
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,960
Begging your pardon,
it won't do no good...

678
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,560
...how much you raise it.

679
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,280
Why is that?

680
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,040
Because of the poor. He
gives them what he takes.

681
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,920
Well, sir...they love him.

682
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,400
Just a minute.

683
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,840
Robin Hood steals
money from my pocket...

684
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,640
...forcing me to hurt the public...

685
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,520
...and they love him for it?

686
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,040
Cancel the food scraps for orphans.

687
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,880
No more merciful beheadings.

688
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,480
And call off Christmas!

689
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,600
The treasury is empty.

690
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,160
Day and night people plague my door...

691
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,720
...whining for tax relief and safe
passage through Sherwood Forest.

692
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,320
"We can't pay what the
highwayman's taken."

693
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,440
It's the shortest route to London!

694
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,040
It's the only route to London.

695
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,280
Sir Guy's patrols have
found nothing, sire?

696
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,720
No camp. Nothing!

697
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,520
This hooded viper simply
slithers into the forest.

698
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,800
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.

699
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,760
You, 10:45.

700
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,560
And bring a friend.

701
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,560
What's the pleasure in this
life Laughter, love and drinking

702
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,000
Good King Richard, bless his
soul Loves wine and warring

703
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,920
But for us who stay at home

704
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,240
There's only beer and whoring

705
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,560
How many?

706
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,400
Twenty.

707
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,600
How many?

708
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,000
Five.

709
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,000
They can't count.

710
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,280
Why scare them?

711
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,160
And they call me barbaric.

712
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,120
Quiet!

713
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,240
It will be difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet.

714
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,080
Yes, my lord.

715
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,880
This is a tree, not a log!

716
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,440
Shut up and help me!

717
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,560
I have to meet a girl!

718
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,400
Men in front, after me. The
rest stay with the wagon!

719
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,200
On to glory!

720
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,200
Bastards! Find them!

721
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,080
Welcome to Sherwood!

722
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,800
I'll be buggered!

723
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,840
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

724
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,880
Good morning, my reverend friend.

725
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,960
Nottingham soldiers are
poor company to travel with.

726
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,960
Tax him!

727
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,560
I'm Robin of Locksley.
And my men are thirsty.

728
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,160
Robin Hood!

729
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,200
I mistook you for common thieves!

730
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,040
Kindly let me pass, sir.

731
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,640
Surely the Lord has the charity to
spare a few barrels for good Christians.

732
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,000
We must celebrate.

733
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,280
If you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew...

734
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,200
...best me for it!

735
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,000
Confess, Robin Hood, that
Friar Tuck is a braver...

736
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,040
...holier and wiser man than thou art!

737
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,200
He giveth and He taketh away.

738
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,920
Do you yield?

739
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,600
I'd rather roast in hell.

740
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,360
I think the Friar's taken us far enough.

741
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,400
Thank you, Lord, for
teaching me humility.

742
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,520
Are these not the meek of the earth?

743
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,800
We need an honest man to minister them.

744
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,360
What say you?

745
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,880
The Lord reveals Himself
in mysterious ways.

746
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,760
I accept.

747
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,880
You won't regret it.

748
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,960
Aye, but you may!

749
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,120
We were ambushed, cousin.

750
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,920
Spanish steel. Much stronger
than our native blades.

751
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,960
Any losses?

752
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,640
Some.

753
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,560
In truth, all of them.

754
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,600
And the gold?

755
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,720
Taken.

756
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
Robin Hood?

757
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,960
They were woodsmen, cousin.

758
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,240
Robin Hood.

759
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,560
I tried.

760
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,600
I tried!

761
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,400
We must be strong.

762
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,520
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

763
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,320
And I can't allow a lieutenant...

764
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,640
...to fail me.

765
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,280
At least I didn't use a spoon.

766
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,400
It's good steel.

767
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,680
Take the left one.

768
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,760
Which is left?

769
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,320
-Which you taking?
-What do you mean?

770
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,680
If you take the left
one, I take the right.

771
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,520
Which one's that?

772
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,360
The one next to....

773
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,080
Just grab them.

774
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,880
Now?

775
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,640
Donation, please.

776
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,520
Donation? For what?

777
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,200
For passage through Sherwood.

778
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,280
Very well.

779
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,160
Come and get it.

780
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,000
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us!

781
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,760
It's me job, my lady.

782
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,840
Who is your employer?

783
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,480
Robin Hood.

784
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,680
I must see him at once.

785
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,680
I'm trying to stop them!

786
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,640
You can't go down there!

787
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,040
He's not expecting you!

788
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,080
My lady's intrusion is tit for tat.

789
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,680
-Move, old traps!
-Don't "old traps" me!

790
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,680
You can't go down there!

791
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,240
Cover your eyes.

792
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,080
You could've said!

793
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,760
You have visitors!

794
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,600
It weren't my fault!

795
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,040
-lt was Much!
-lt weren't me!

796
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,920
What are you doing?

797
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,840
Taking a Lady's advice.

798
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,560
What happened to your eye?

799
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,360
-We was set upon by ten--
-Twelve!

800
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,080
Fifteen! Large, big lads!

801
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,840
You've been busy.

802
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,480
We have guests!

803
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,880
It works.

804
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,960
Kind of.

805
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,640
Of course it works.

806
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,440
Take your time.

807
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,080
Can you do it amidst distraction?

808
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,920
Can you do it when you must?

809
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,800
Show him, Wulf.

810
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,160
Can you?

811
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,040
It was a dirty trick.

812
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,800
Is your shirt coming off?

813
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,280
Well done!

814
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,000
This is grain, which any fool can eat...

815
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:36,080
...but for which the Lord intended
a more divine means of consumption.

816
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,600
Let us give praise to our
Maker and glory to His bounty...

817
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,360
...by learning about...

818
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,040
...beer!

819
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,040
Are you bragging?

820
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,440
This is blood money, Marian.

821
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,040
Intended to bribe King Richard's
enemies to unite against him.

822
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,880
We intercepted it.

823
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,240
Who
would--

824
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,440
Nottingham.

825
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,880
Nottingham would not challenge the king.

826
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,800
He's not here to be challenged.

827
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,840
He might lose his country.

828
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,800
You thought I was keeping it all.

829
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,360
Didn't you?

830
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,800
A contribution to your cause.

831
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,680
-Keep it.
-It's valuable.

832
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,520
It's not dear to me.

833
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:37,840
It is.

834
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,040
It's not.

835
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,600
I'm saying everything wrong.

836
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:45,880
Cheers.

837
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,320
How do I get down?

838
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,960
Wait!

839
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,400
We don't go that way anymore.

840
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,680
I'm happy to hear that.

841
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,800
Grab on.

842
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,320
We have a rule here.

843
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,160
Once someone sees the way to our
camp, that person cannot leave.

844
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,480
Too many lives are at stake.

845
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,080
Sarah and I were blindfolded.

846
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,840
Will you join us for dinner?

847
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,840
Perhaps.

848
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,040
Salaam, little one.

849
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,920
Did God paint you?

850
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,880
Did God paint me?

851
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,680
For certain.

852
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,160
Why?

853
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,640
Because...

854
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,840
...Allah loves wondrous variety.

855
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,200
How has a once arrogant
young nobleman...

856
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,640
...found contentment living
with the salt of the earth?

857
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:21,120
I've seen knights panic at
the first hint of battle.

858
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:26,520
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed
squire pull a spear from his own body...

859
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,760
...to defend a dying horse.

860
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,280
Nobility's not a birthright.

861
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,640
It's defined by one's actions.

862
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,280
It's interesting to hear you say that.

863
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,840
I didn't.

864
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,840
My father did.

865
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,880
Did the Holy Quest
erase your hatred of him?

866
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,360
I don't know.

867
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,560
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

868
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,520
I was lost after my mother died.

869
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,280
My father too. And for a
short time he found comfort...

870
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,200
...with another woman.

871
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,160
A peasant woman.

872
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,880
I felt he betrayed my mother's memory.

873
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,320
He gave her up?

874
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,000
For the love of a 12-year-old
boy who would never forgive him.

875
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,800
Who says I'm content?

876
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,000
I have my plans for the future.

877
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,840
A grander scheme than this?

878
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,440
No, a simpler one.

879
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,200
A home...family...

880
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,080
...Iove.

881
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,400
Men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

882
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,200
When it doesn't, 'tis a burden to them.

883
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,200
Robin of the Hood...

884
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,800
...Prince of Thieves...

885
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,360
...is he capable of love?

886
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,840
Father!

887
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,960
It's Mother, she's dying!

888
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,480
Your baby has not turned.

889
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,240
It cannot be born without help.

890
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,640
He's the devil sent to lead us astray.

891
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,080
He'll kill her!

892
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,120
If you do not listen to me...

893
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,280
...she will die, and the child.

894
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,560
The Friar's done all he can.

895
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,920
I suggest you let the Moor try.

896
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,920
So be it.

897
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,720
Then be it on your head!

898
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,600
Get me a needle, thread, water.

899
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,280
Hurry!

900
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,360
Come with me, Tom, John!

901
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,080
What will you do?

902
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,960
I've seen it many times.

903
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,760
With horses.

904
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,280
With horses?

905
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,040
Bite down.

906
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,840
Help me.

907
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,080
It will be all right.

908
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,120
I tell you, John, the
barbarian is killing her.

909
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,920
Out of the way, boy!

910
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,840
Quick, take him.

911
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,960
What is it?

912
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,960
Your son, my lady.

913
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,920
You truly are a Great One.

914
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,280
My son!

915
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,320
Look at the lovely little
baby. Isn't he wonderful?

916
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,000
The Lord has taught me a fine lesson.

917
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,320
Though I may think I am
godly, I am not worldly.

918
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,840
Please.

919
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,800
My barbarian friend, let's open a barrel
and try to save each other's souls.

920
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,440
Alas, I am not permitted.

921
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,960
Fine. You talk, I'll drink.

922
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,320
May I have this dance?

923
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,360
This lady is spoken for.

924
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,680
Why this way?

925
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,320
So you cannot return or
be forced to tell the way.

926
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,280
It was good to see you, Marian.

927
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,560
It was good to be seen.

928
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,520
I have two favors to ask.

929
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,520
One.

930
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,480
Take Duncan with you.

931
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,760
I fear for his health.

932
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,640
And I'm tired of his bellyaching.

933
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,920
You wish me to leave?

934
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,840
Old friend, listen to me.

935
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,960
Take Marian safely home.

936
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,240
I fear for her safety.

937
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,160
Of course, sire.

938
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,240
Two?

939
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,080
You're King Richard's cousin.

940
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,280
You can get word to him
of Nottingham's plan.

941
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,880
He would believe you.

942
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,080
If the Sheriff found
out, I'd lose all I have.

943
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,360
That's true.

944
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,480
Do it for your king.

945
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,920
I'll do it for you.

946
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,040
He fancies you, my lady.

947
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,600
I am blind, but some
things I can still see.

948
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,160
In 10 days, the barons are coming.

949
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,920
Robin Hood stole what I was
to pay for their allegiance.

950
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:23,000
I am surrounded by fools who
do not realize my obligations.

951
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,520
Tell me, Mortianna...

952
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,800
...am I thwarted?

953
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,840
Recruit the beasts that share our God.

954
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,400
Animals?

955
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,480
From the North.

956
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,520
You mean Celts. They drink
the blood of the dead.

957
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,000
Yoke their strength.

958
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,240
Hired thugs.

959
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,480
Brilliant!

960
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,160
Put thine own issue on the throne.

961
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,520
A child? How?

962
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,360
Ally with royal blood.

963
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,800
Who?

964
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,200
It's a personal matter, my
lord. But of vital importance.

965
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,520
I understand, my lady.

966
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,080
This is my most trusted emissary.

967
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:57,680
He must travel to France immediately
and give this personally to the King.

968
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,840
My lady-in-waiting
will accompany you.

969
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,760
My dear, I could not
vouch for her safety.

970
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,240
The journey is full of danger.

971
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:11,040
I appreciate your concern, but Sarah's
a skilled rider and I insist she go.

972
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,920
As you wish.

973
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,560
What's wrong?

974
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,280
My horse is favoring his foreleg.

975
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,160
Duncan, is that you?

976
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,360
Hello?

977
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,160
Rebecca?

978
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,520
Nicodemus! Go!

979
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,600
Find mice.

980
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,520
I've never seen a noblewoman's breasts.

981
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,960
We couldn't stop them, my lady!

982
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,520
Someone wants a word with you.

983
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,160
Easy!

984
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,280
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.

985
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,320
It's the warning arrow!

986
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,720
All is well! It's Duncan!

987
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,480
What happened?

988
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,200
I found you. Thank God, I did it.

989
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,320
Nottingham's men attacked us.

990
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,400
And Marian?

991
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,680
They took Marian.

992
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,240
What is it?

993
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,360
Over there! Look!

994
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,560
On the hill!

995
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,400
Allah, be merciful.

996
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,200
To the trees!

997
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,360
To the trees!

998
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,280
They're coming!

999
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,920
Old fool led them straight to us.

1000
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,680
Get me prisoners.

1001
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,120
Children!

1002
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:44,800
My God!

1003
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,880
Save yourselves!

1004
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,160
We better go, Robin! Now!

1005
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,920
This way, my lambs. Come on!

1006
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,160
Hold your fire!

1007
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,760
Gold! Gold! It's gold!

1008
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,520
Fanny!

1009
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:06,800
Come on!

1010
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,040
Save yourself, John!

1011
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,800
No, Fanny, I won't leave you!

1012
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,960
John, catch her!

1013
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,880
I got you, girl!

1014
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,160
Quick!

1015
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,000
Go on!

1016
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,720
Don't wait!

1017
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,760
John, go on!

1018
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,120
Hurry!

1019
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,280
Corpus Christi.

1020
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:14,840
Amen.

1021
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,600
My lady Marian.

1022
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,920
By what right do you keep me prisoner?

1023
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,240
You misunderstand my intentions.

1024
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,880
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1025
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,760
Protection from whom?

1026
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,440
From yourself.

1027
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,680
It seems you've been
consorting with outlaws.

1028
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,520
Where do you hear such lies?

1029
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,800
By your own hand, my lady.

1030
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,040
I'm sorry, my child.

1031
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:12,760
I feared you were being led astray.

1032
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,760
Come.

1033
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:27,280
It's over.

1034
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:31,560
Today I return justice to this land.

1035
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,880
I shall hang the
ringleaders, of course, but...

1036
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:40,840
...I'll be generous and spare the lives
of the woodsmen and their families.

1037
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,560
The children.

1038
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,000
And, of course...

1039
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,120
...your traitorous
lady-in-waiting.

1040
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,880
As a wedding gift.

1041
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,640
And just who am I supposed to marry?

1042
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,720
Search your heart, my child.

1043
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,560
Why not a union with the
House of Nottingham...

1044
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,160
...and heal the wounds in our land?

1045
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,280
Only one man can heal
the wounds of this land.

1046
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:20,720
Robin Hood.

1047
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,360
I'm truly sorry, my lady.

1048
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,120
He wasted his life.

1049
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,320
How many lives would you waste?

1050
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,840
What a beautiful child.

1051
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,280
So young.

1052
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:02,400
So alive, so unaware of
how precarious life can be.

1053
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,960
I had a very sad childhood.
I'll tell you about it sometime.

1054
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,680
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1055
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,840
Our bonding would allow these
children to grow up as my allies.

1056
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,200
You understand...

1057
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,640
...I cannot allow them
to grow up as my enemies.

1058
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,160
I have no choice.

1059
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,360
That's true.

1060
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,680
Look!

1061
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:30,640
Christian!

1062
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:51,960
I have heard that Robin
Hood may still be alive.

1063
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:56,280
Either tell me where he may be hiding...

1064
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,600
...or we'll hang you, catch him
anyway and do the same to him.

1065
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,400
I'd love to kill him for you.

1066
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,880
So he is alive, then.

1067
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,600
I'm not really sure.

1068
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,000
Then why would I need you?

1069
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:19,440
Because, my lord, if he is
alive I can get close to him.

1070
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,520
He wouldn't suspect one of his men.

1071
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,960
-He knows you hate him!
-Shut up!

1072
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,960
He's trusting. And if he doesn't
believe me, he'll kill me...

1073
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,840
...then you've lost nothing.

1074
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:34,920
If you fail...

1075
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,640
...I will personally
remove your lying tongue.

1076
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,800
My pride brought us to this.

1077
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,240
It's you who gave pride to these people.

1078
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:32,120
I was a fool.

1079
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,120
A fool to let him leave...

1080
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,280
...to believe I planned it so perfectly.

1081
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,560
A wise man once said:

1082
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,480
There are no perfect
men in this world...

1083
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,880
...only perfect intentions.

1084
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,320
You were an honor to
your countrymen today.

1085
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,640
You fought better than
twenty English knights.

1086
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,800
-I thought you were taken.
-I was.

1087
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,600
How'd you escape?

1088
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,320
Traitor!

1089
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,280
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1090
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,960
Get in there!

1091
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:50,160
Nobody escapes the Sheriff
unless he's lining his pockets.

1092
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,240
Where's my son?!

1093
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,720
I'll have your hide!

1094
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,480
Bugger me!

1095
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,200
Let him speak.

1096
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,920
I bring a message...

1097
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:13,800
...from Nottingham.

1098
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,680
Our men are to be hung in
the square at high noon.

1099
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,760
And my boy?

1100
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:20,880
The boy too.

1101
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,560
Ten men in all.

1102
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:26,400
The hangings are part
of the celebration...

1103
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,440
...for the Sheriff's marriage.

1104
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,240
To who?

1105
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,200
Lady Marian.

1106
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,000
A bride of royal blood.

1107
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,200
And with King Richard gone...

1108
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,120
...he'll be after the throne.

1109
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,800
You were to use this news to
get near me, then kill me, right?

1110
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:51,360
What are your intentions?

1111
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:54,120
It depends on you, Locksley.

1112
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,440
I've never trusted
you, that's no secret.

1113
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,560
Will you finish what you started?

1114
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:05,040
Or will he run like the spoiled
rich boy I always took him for?

1115
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:10,480
Did I wrong you in
another life, Will Scarlet?

1116
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,480
Where does this hatred for me come from?

1117
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,840
From knowing that...

1118
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:30,080
...our father loved you best.

1119
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:36,760
We are brothers.

1120
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:42,120
I'm the son of the woman who
replaced your dead mother for a time!

1121
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,720
Your anger drove them apart!

1122
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,920
It's not a lie! You ruined my life!

1123
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,320
I have more reason to
hate you than anyone.

1124
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,320
But I dared to believe in you.

1125
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,400
What I must know, brother...

1126
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,520
...is will you stay with us
and finish what you started?

1127
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:19,960
I have a brother?

1128
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:25,520
I have a brother!

1129
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,480
I will make my stand with you.

1130
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:33,360
Side by side.

1131
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,360
To the end.

1132
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,440
To the end!

1133
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,040
We're all in.

1134
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:45,600
Daft buggers.

1135
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,360
We finish this.

1136
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,720
Truly, you are a wizard!

1137
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,440
The mystery is in the black powder.

1138
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:03,360
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.

1139
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,680
You'll be by the gate to
cut off reinforcements.

1140
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:11,800
John, you sit on this
wall to protect our escape.

1141
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,640
I will hide below the scaffold...

1142
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,320
...to cut our men from their nooses.

1143
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,320
I'll do that. You
cover us with your bow.

1144
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,080
It's too dangerous.

1145
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,920
So is your aim.

1146
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:29,400
Whatever Azeem is concocting,
we must each be in place for it.

1147
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,640
Now our success depends
on total concert.

1148
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,120
-We may be only six men--
-Seven.

1149
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:39,400
-What? Where's the little ones?
-Safe with my mother.

1150
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,800
You cracked? You'd get hurt.

1151
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:45,040
I've had 8 babies. Don't
tell me about getting hurt.

1152
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:48,040
Anyway, I won't just sit
and let one of them die!

1153
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,920
You should be bloody
minding the other seven.

1154
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,840
Tell her, Rob.

1155
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:00,960
You will take position here.

1156
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:17,400
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1157
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,560
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1158
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,240
What have you got there?

1159
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:32,400
The Lord's finest brew for the
good Sheriff's fighting men.

1160
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,680
It has a mighty kick.

1161
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,960
-Do I know you?
-Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1162
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,880
Oh, my God, you stink.

1163
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,600
Pardon my blindness.
I'm always falling--

1164
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:49,440
Careful, Friar.

1165
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:53,640
What are you doing?

1166
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,000
Distributing libations for the
celebration of the Sheriff's nuptials.

1167
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,520
Is something amiss?

1168
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,800
You are. Get this out of here!

1169
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,720
Caesar has spoken, my
leprous friend. Let's depart.

1170
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,320
Is this your finger?

1171
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:10,080
Leper?! Get out of here!

1172
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:13,440
Leaving bits of himself
all over England.

1173
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:23,400
What are you doing?

1174
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,480
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging.

1175
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,360
-What's in this bundle?
-That's firewood.

1176
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:35,520
Hello, my lover.

1177
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:45,120
Make way for the Lord's work!

1178
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,480
Make way for the Lord's work!

1179
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:50,520
A benediction for these poor
men who are about to stretch.

1180
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,280
God receive them in Thy mercy...

1181
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,600
...and show them the love
they so richly deserve.

1182
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:02,320
Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.

1183
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,360
It's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1184
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,440
No more than your wedding present.

1185
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,000
Bring them out!

1186
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:17,240
What's going on?

1187
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:20,640
Bring him here!

1188
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,000
Oh, the turncoat!

1189
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,360
Did you succeed?

1190
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,240
I found his lair, but...

1191
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,600
...he was dead.

1192
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,680
You sure? You saw Hood's body?

1193
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:51,760
I saw a grave.

1194
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:54,280
He had this.

1195
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,000
String him up.

1196
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,000
Leave him! He's only a boy.

1197
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:25,080
Now?

1198
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,840
It appears there's no more room!

1199
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:47,000
I'll have to respectfully decline!

1200
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:59,880
There's always room for one more.

1201
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,040
That's my boy!

1202
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,840
Get some troops in here!

1203
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:55,480
What are you waiting for?!

1204
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:45,400
Father!

1205
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:52,720
Come on, you milksops!

1206
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:54,720
Fight your way free.

1207
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:03,640
This way! To the wall!

1208
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:05,240
Lord Sheriff...

1209
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:07,680
...is this your idea of control?!

1210
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,440
Shut up, you twit!

1211
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:12,440
Come!

1212
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:22,040
English!

1213
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:24,000
English!

1214
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:27,680
Behold Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir!

1215
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:30,520
I am not one of you...

1216
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,440
...but I fight!

1217
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,040
I fight with Robin Hood...

1218
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:36,440
...against a tyrant...

1219
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:38,960
...who holds you under his boot!

1220
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,360
If you would be free men...

1221
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,880
...then you must fight! Join us now!

1222
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:47,840
Join Robin Hood!

1223
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:27,280
Close the gate!

1224
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,160
Guard it with your life!

1225
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:32,960
Bring the Bishop to my chapel!

1226
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:44,640
Is she worth it?

1227
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:46,960
Worth dying for?

1228
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,200
Fuck me, he cleared it!

1229
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,360
We're doomed.

1230
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:45,040
'Tis rebellion! We must escape!

1231
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:46,520
Marry us!

1232
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:49,560
I will never marry you!

1233
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:54,440
That's my wife, crone!

1234
02:01:57,480 --> 02:01:58,920
She's ripe.

1235
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,240
She'll give us a son. Take her now.

1236
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:06,880
I will not take her
until we are properly wed!

1237
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:11,400
For once, I will have something pure!

1238
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:14,560
'Tis madness to delay.

1239
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:17,440
Marry them...

1240
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:19,120
...or face me!

1241
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,320
Where is she?

1242
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:46,960
The lady Marian?

1243
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:49,280
Up the stairs, that way!

1244
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:00,080
Get on with it!

1245
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,320
Statue!

1246
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:11,640
Do you, George, Sheriff of Nottingham...

1247
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,800
...take this woman for your wife?

1248
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,040
To have and hold...

1249
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:27,640
...in sickness and in
health, for better or worse--

1250
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,760
Yes, yes! Come on!

1251
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,200
Make haste!

1252
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:35,280
And do you, Marian, take
this man to be your husband?

1253
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:37,840
Yes, of course she does.

1254
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:46,720
Damned English oak!

1255
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,360
I'll try another way.

1256
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:03,720
What do you want?!

1257
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,840
I can't do this with all that racket!

1258
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,440
How could you?!

1259
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,200
The painted man!

1260
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,520
The witch!

1261
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:39,880
I didn't know. I didn't know it
was you. Please, sire, have pity.

1262
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,360
Don't harm an old woman.

1263
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:04,480
You may take this body,
but it will not be me!

1264
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,320
Not again!

1265
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:11,200
I pronounce you man and wife,
in the name of the Father...

1266
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,360
...the Son...

1267
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:14,880
...and the Holy Ghost.

1268
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:30,120
Do you mind, Locksley?

1269
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:32,720
We've just been married.

1270
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:46,560
Recognize this?

1271
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:51,240
It belonged to your father.

1272
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:53,720
Appropriate, isn't it...

1273
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:56,160
...that I use it to send you to him?

1274
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,440
I shall never fear my father's sword.

1275
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:02,840
Really?

1276
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:08,040
Now we're even.

1277
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,960
If I must, I'll take
you a piece at a time.

1278
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:44,760
I'll do the taking today.

1279
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:59,480
You sold your soul to Satan, Your Grace.

1280
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,400
You accused innocent men of
witchcraft and let them die.

1281
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:10,560
Brother Friar, you would not
strike a fellow man of the cloth.

1282
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,800
No, I wouldn't.

1283
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:17,640
I'll help you pack for your journey.

1284
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:20,120
You'll need lots of gold.

1285
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,520
You're a very rich man.

1286
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:23,520
This too.

1287
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:25,520
And there!

1288
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:28,720
Here's thirty pieces of silver...

1289
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:32,040
...to pay the devil on your way to hell!

1290
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:39,240
Get ready.

1291
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:08,520
I have fulfilled my vow.

1292
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,360
You came for me.

1293
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,200
You're alive.

1294
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:32,840
I would die for you.

1295
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:45,600
By the power vested in me by
God's holy church, I say any man...

1296
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:48,000
...with reason why these
two shouldn't be joined...

1297
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,840
...Iet him speak now...

1298
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,760
...or forever hold his peace.

1299
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,880
-I now pronounce you--
-Hold!

1300
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:00,920
I speak!

1301
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,320
Richard!

1302
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,800
I will not allow this
wedding to proceed.

1303
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,600
Unless...

1304
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:30,120
...I'm allowed to give the bride away.

1305
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:31,600
You look radiant, cousin.

1306
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:37,200
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.

1307
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:40,280
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.

1308
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,960
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.

1309
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:44,960
Proceed!

1310
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:54,680
Husband and wife.

1311
02:11:56,520 --> 02:11:57,520
Kiss the bride.

1312
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,520
I know that.

1313
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:26,200
Get out of it.

1314
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:29,040
We waste good celebration time.

1315
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:40,040
