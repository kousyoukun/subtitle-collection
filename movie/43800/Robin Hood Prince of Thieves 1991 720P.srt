00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,739
You're dog's meat, son,
do you know that?

165
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,786
Get down here! You know what
you've done. Come down here!

166
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,540
- Down!
- You're not playing by the rules, boy.

167
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,209
Deer don't climb trees.

168
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,795
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

169
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,631
Shall we teach him to fly?

170
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,926
Get him down.

171
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,470
ROBIN: Hold.

172
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:58,268
I'm curious as to what manner of creature is
so fearsome it takes six men to attack it?

173
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,479
Stand down. This is no affair of yours.

174
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,649
Well, have we treed the devil himself?
Let me see.

175
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,154
A small boy, a truly dangerous animal.

176
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,949
This boy killed one
of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

177
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,660
You starve us! We needed the meat.

178
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,289
I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
This is the sheriff's land.

179
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,999
Wrong.

180
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,837
This is my land and my tree. Therefore
whatever's in it also belongs to me.

181
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:32,677
Might I have the pleasure of your name
before I have you run through?

182
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,805
Robin of Locksley.

183
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,021
Well, well... Locksley.

184
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,274
Welcome home.

185
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,153
- Kill him!
MAN 1: To arms, swords!

186
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,238
- Come on, hurry up!
MAN 2: He's armed!

187
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,493
Azeem! It's time to redeem that vow!

188
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,871
Unleash the hounds!

189
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,083
Get off your damn knees!

190
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,671
Look out!

191
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,888
WULF: Yeah!

192
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,520
Now, sir...

193
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,732
if you'd be so kind as to give me
your name before I run you through.

194
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,736
Guy of Gisborne, the sheriff's cousin.

195
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,158
- That little bastard was poaching deer.
- Poach?

196
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,036
Is it not a greater crime
to starve a family?

197
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,373
Go on, Locksley.

198
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,500
Go on.

199
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,463
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

200
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,383
Now get off my land.

201
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:04,352
Tell Nottingham what happens to his scum
when they pick on small children.

202
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,399
You.

203
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,528
You travel 10,000 miles to save my life,
then leave me to be butchered?!

204
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,239
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

205
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,409
Which does not include prayer times
or meal times...

206
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,828
or any time I'm outnumbered 6 to 1.

207
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,372
You whine like a mule.

208
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,417
You are still alive.

209
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,718
Have no fear. Come down, boy.

210
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,850
Is it true, boy? Did you kill a deer?

211
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,437
Hundreds of them.

212
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,902
You scared him.

213
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,951
AZEEM:
Interesting place, this...

214
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,703
England.

215
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,227
MAN: Hold up, Sir Guy.
The sheriff's not to be disturbed.

216
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,153
Cousin.

217
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,658
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

218
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:47,580
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people.

219
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,124
Who told you to cover up?

220
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,502
His name?

221
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,754
Robin of Locksley.

222
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,215
The prodigal son returns.

223
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,385
He's a whelp!
This girl could best him.

224
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,679
Put it there!

225
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:10,103
Yes, well, this whelp
bested four of my men.

226
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,773
NOTTINGHAM:
Yes, well, your men were probably drunk.

227
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,070
- Yet you survived, cousin.
- I barely survived.

228
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,203
GUY:... markings of Islam.

229
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,873
NOTTINGHAM: I'm sure it will take an army
to match these rogues.

230
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,629
I trust Locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning.

231
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,591
Time for portents, cousin.

232
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,855
Mortianna?

233
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,790
Shut up.

You called, madam?

235
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,127
What do you see?

236
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,258
- The son of a dead man.
- Locksley.

237
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:09,305
- Does he affect us?
- He precedes the Lionheart.

238
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,767
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
That could prove awkward...

239
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,520
and will soften the spines
of the barons. Soon?

240
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,480
Make haste.

241
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,191
But my plan is still intact?

I have seen our death.

The painted man,
he haunts my dreams.

Adorned with strange,
foreign markings.

No.

Is that you?

Praise be! I thought God
had abandoned us.

DUNCAN: It's a miracle!
- Why...?

265

- Why didn't you cut him down?
DUNCAN: It's a miracle, I never thought...

266
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,036
- Damn you, Duncan, are you deaf?!
- Easy!

267
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,871
Look at him.

268
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,167
I would have done if I could see.

ROBIN:
Who did this to you, Duncan?

00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,593
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

271
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,721
With the sheriff and his witch
looking on.

272
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,433
- Why?
- They say the sheriff captured your father...

273
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,310
worshipping the devil.

274
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,813
That he signed a confession
before the bishop.

275
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,984
No, that's not possible.

276
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:31,155
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

277
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,116
Did you believe the charges?

278
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,371
Not even when they took my eyes.

He loved you to the end, young master.

00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,310
He never gave up hope of your return.

282
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,646
I should have been here.

283
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:09,068
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

284
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:13,656
He said it was vanity to force
other men to our religion.

But you must flee now.

00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,980
- Because you're short?
- Nope.

485
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,900
It's because I'm so long!

486
00:44:56,903 --> 00:45:01,616
- They ought to have a look.
- No, Bull, save it! Save it for the ladies.

487
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,619
Give the man some mead.

488
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:09,624
Now, I made that myself.

489
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,963
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years...

490
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,799
that a friend of mine's not welcome
at this table?

491
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,343
But he's a savage, sire!

492
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,304
That he is.

493
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,434
But no more than you or I.

494
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,855
And don't call me sire.

495
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,193
With regret, I must decline.

496
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,281
- Allah forbids it.
- Your bloody loss, mate.

497
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,367
How is it there are so many of you
in hiding?

498
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:48,329
We're all outlaws.
Got prices on our heads.

499
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,998
Even the young lad there.

500
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:54,377
It's that blasted sheriff,
he says we owes him taxes.

501
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:58,757
You know, your ghosts will only keep
the sheriff's men at bay so long.

502
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,885
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

503
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,143
We can always fight back.

504
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,604
[MEN LAUGHING]

505
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,191
I reckon I must've cracked
that noble head of yours.

506
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,693
These are all good lads here.

507
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,362
They've got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

508
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:25,825
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

509
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,745
MAN: They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

510
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,247
- A witch?
WULF: She knows every man's thoughts.

511
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:35,418
- You can see through her. And she flies.
- That's a load of codswallop.

512
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:39,214
What does the rich son of a devil worshipper
care what happens to outlaw peasants?

513
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,925
DUNCAN:
My lord was a kind and generous man!

514
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,178
Who among you dares
believe him capable...?

515
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:47,931
My father was no devil worshipper.

516
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:52,310
And I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

517
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,023
But he's right.

518
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,402
I was a rich man's son.

519
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,574
But when I killed the sheriff's men...

520
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,703
- ...I became an outlaw like you.
- You are nothing like us.

521
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,959
JOHN:
That there's Will Scarlett.

522
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,546
Don't take no notice of him.
He's full of piss and wind.

523
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,423
Come on, lads, drink up.

524
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,176
Stop talking so much bloody rubbish.

525
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,972
This here is the best
that we simple men can expect.

526
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,307
Here we're safe.

527
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:35,061
Here we are kings.

528
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,298
- Too much mead, old friend?
- Forgive me, I oversleep.

529
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,175
No. No, no. Rest yourself.

530
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,188
- What day is it, Duncan?
- Sunday, I think.

531
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:23,234
Do they still give alms
to the poor at Mass?

532
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,777
That they do.

533
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:28,948
These days, the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

534
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:47,133
Well, my other god calls.

535
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,262
Oh, don't upset yourself, Mortianna.

536
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,350
Appearances are important to that lot,
especially on a Sunday.

537
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:59,938
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

538
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,691
Although...

539
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,945
frankly, sometimes...

540
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,032
I can't see much difference.

541
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:18,498
Did my parents truly tell you
to instruct me in all this?

542
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,793
Their dying wish.

543
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,752
MAN:
We beseech thy blessing, Lord...

544
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:09,757
on all your people,
but most especially...

545
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:13,261
on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

546
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,598
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

547
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,268
our glorious city.

548
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,770
Grant him also the strength...

549
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,607
to bring to justice
the lawless men...

550
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:31,154
who would threaten its safety
and prosperity.

551
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,032
And the judgment
to punish them...

552
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,493
in your name. Amen.

553
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:40,246
MEN: Amen.

554
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,206
PRIEST: Go in peace.

555
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,425
- Sarah?
- Yes.

556
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:58,598
- That's all I have.
WOMAN: God bless you, ma'am.

557
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:19,535
ROBIN:
Alms for a blind man, my lady?

558
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:23,247
For one who cannot see your beauty?

559
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:29,545
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

560
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,173
Searching my soul.

561
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:35,510
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

562
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,179
ROBIN:
Do you prefer the company of Nottingham'?

563
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:40,056
There's a price on your head.

564
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:42,725
- How much?
- One hundred gold pieces.

565
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,685
Is that all?

566
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:48,731
I shall have to annoy the good sheriff more.
Soon it will be 1000.

567
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,484
For 1000, I would turn you in myself.

568
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,028
Nottingham is mounting an army.

569
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:58,533
He has every blacksmith in the county holed
up in the castle making swords and armor.

570
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,952
- What is he planning?
- I don't know.

571
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,996
But there's no limit
to the man's ambitions.

572
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:08,751
- Go. Quickly, go!
- Thank you.

573
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,337
Robin, do something for me.

574
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,714
- What?
- Take a bath.

575
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,883
Take a bath?

576
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:38,281
These are my private chambers, my son.

577
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:42,160
I have priests who would
hear your confession.

578
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,203
- Ah!
- Shh.

579
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,837
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

580
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,424
Welcome home, Robin.

581
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:01,137
You shine like the sun, my lady.

582
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:04,098
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

583
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:08,394
My cousin tells me the knave
deprived you of some horses.

584
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,522
- Yes, a most disagreeable experience.
- Yes, I know.

585
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,691
And for inflicting that upon you...

586
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,736
I'm going to hang him from the walls
by his entrails.

587
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:17,945
I'd like to see that.

588
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,698
If you'd bring your household
within the city...

589
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,201
I could give your needs
personal attention.

590
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,872
I do thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

591
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,918
Well, then perhaps
you'd do me the honor...

592
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:36,797
of accepting a small token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

593
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:44,805
King Richard would be deeply moved
to hear of your concern for my welfare.

594
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,682
Yes. Um...

595
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:50,394
I'm afraid the king has many enemies
both abroad and at home.

596
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,647
I fear for his safe return.

597
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,608
Oh, no, fear not, dear sheriff.
He will return.

598
00:53:55,775 --> 00:54:00,363
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

599
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:09,497
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one...

600
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:14,126
because his answer vexed me
so grievously.

601
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,671
He said...

602
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:22,093
he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

603
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,729
You lie.

604
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:43,281
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

605
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:54,417
NOTTINGHAM:
You bastard! In there!

606
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:55,960
Get him!

607
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,384
Locksley!

608
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:07,388
I'm going to cut your heart out
with a spoon!

609
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,974
Then it begins.

610
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:29,827
WOMAN: He's taking the sheriff's horse!
MAN 1: He's stealing the sheriff's horse!

611
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,956
Close that gate!

612
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:39,045
MAN 2: The sheriff's horse! Close the gate!
He's stolen the sheriff's horse.

613
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,398
NOTTINGHAM:
What are you looking at?!

614
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,003
Water!

615
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,839
- Thank you.
- For the animal.

616
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:27,927
How can I protect you, Christian,
if I know not where you go?

617
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:31,389
You've hardly raised a finger
when you do know...

618
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,349
great one.

619
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,434
I prefer to have the choice.

620
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,853
WILL: Wonderful! You've stolen
the sheriff's horse?

621
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,981
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

622
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,818
- Are you afraid, John?
- Yeah, a little.

623
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:48,322
So is the sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

624
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:52,535
- You fool! You've started a war!
ROBIN: We're already at war.

625
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,997
Bread.

626
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:01,669
And I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes...

627
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,213
- ...and would hunt our children.
- We?

628
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,675
You planning to join us then, matey?

629
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,678
No, to lead you.

630
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,600
Christian.

631
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,853
These are simple people.

632
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,147
They are not warriors.

633
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,358
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

634
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:28,863
You forget yourself, Azeem.
I do not ask for your company or council.

635
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:34,535
Why a spoon, cousin?
Why not an ax?

636
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:38,998
NOTTINGHAM: Because it's dull, you twit!
It'll hurt more!

637
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:42,543
I want this brigand found.

638
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,295
