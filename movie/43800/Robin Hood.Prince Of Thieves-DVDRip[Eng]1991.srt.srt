1
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,467
Show them the courage of Allah!

2
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,706
He says you stole the bread.

3
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,915
It's a lie.

4
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,209
I caught him stealing ours.

5
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,462
Cut off the infidel's hand.

6
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:34,797
I took it!

7
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,007
That's not true.

8
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,800
They're not interested in truth.

9
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,135
But he's lying!

10
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,095
You're too weak to survive it.

11
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,388
As you wish.

12
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,682
Cut the other's hand off, too.

13
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,518
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Robin.

14
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,760
This is English courage.

15
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,528
That's for five years of hell!

16
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,370
Behind you!

17
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,380
Come on, for God's sake!

18
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:05,926
Take us with you!

19
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:14,392
You can't save those people!

20
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:16,311
But you can save me!

21
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:17,812
They're coming, Robin.

22
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,606
Come on!

23
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:20,940
Christian!

24
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,152
-Why should l?
-For pity's sake.

25
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:25,820
Mine is a sentence of death.

26
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:29,574
-He's a Moor! Don't listen!
-Set me free! I'll show you a way out.

27
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,077
-Why should we?
-lf you do not, we are all dead men.

28
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,080
No, Robin, for God's sake! They're coming!

29
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,505
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,182
This way!

31
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:04,941
Thanks. I misjudged you.

32
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,110
You are fast with a sword.

33
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:10,988
I waited five years for the smell of free air.
That makes a man fast.

34
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:19,622
It's mortal.

35
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:21,749
Leave me.

36
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:26,378
Give this ring to my sister, Marian.

37
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,839
Now swear you'll protect her.

38
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,925
His wound is by the heart.
We cannot save him.

39
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,885
Swear it, Robin!

40
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:37,097
-I swear it.
-They're coming!

41
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,891
Tell Marian I died a free Englishman.

42
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,030
Come, my friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honor.

43
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,448
Come!

44
00:07:23,975 --> 00:07:25,769
Why did you cut me free?

45
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:31,107
Whatever blood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

46
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,198
Farewell, friend.

47
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,450
Godspeed your way.

48
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,954
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

49
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:47,748
You have saved my life.

50
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,501
I vow to stay with you until I save yours.

51
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:55,297
But I go to England.
I relieve you of your obligation.

52
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,049
Only Allah can do that.

53
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,636
What if I say no?

54
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:02,804
You have no choice.

55
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:05,932
I am Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir.

56
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,143
You may call me Azeem.

57
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:13,064
Robin of Locksley.

58
00:08:27,328 --> 00:08:28,954
Lindest sir...

59
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:32,541
it is rumored you fought
in Ling Richard's Crusade...

60
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,127
with my beloved son Robin.

61
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:39,006
I fear you have returned home
to desperate times...

62
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,968
when dark forces
plot against our absent King.

63
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:46,012
I am anxious for word of my son.

64
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:49,474
Were you present at his capture
near Jerusalem?

65
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:52,686
Do you know which potentate holds him?

66
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,897
Does he still bear me ill will?

67
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:58,816
A Iittle news, please, sir.

68
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:02,195
I would give all I own for his release.

69
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:19,253
Help me!

70
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:22,172
You should have waited!

71
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:24,424
I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.

72
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,551
It's all right. Let him go.

73
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:33,058
They've taken my Gwen. My daughter!

74
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,225
Who?

75
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:37,270
Men! On horses. In masks.

76
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:40,356
We tried to stop them!

77
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:43,568
My son...is dead!

78
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:58,374
Master, stay.
There is an evil moon tonight.

79
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:01,293
Never fear, Duncan. Good will overcome.

80
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:02,920
Trust in that.

81
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,477
I'm sorry, my lord. I had no choice.

82
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:29,862
You!

83
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,201
The King shall hear of this!

84
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,327
Join us.

85
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:38,496
Never.

86
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:41,582
Join us...

87
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:43,042
or die.

88
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:49,298
God and King Richard!

89
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:43,558
Thank you, Lord.

90
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,398
I'm home!

91
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,400
I'm home!

92
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:57,613
You are strange, Christian.

93
00:11:58,155 --> 00:11:59,532
But I'm free!

94
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:02,284
I beg you to free yourself of your vow.

95
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,953
Return with the boat.

96
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:07,373
I know how it feels to be far
from home and family.

97
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:12,211
Because I love them so much,
I cannot dishonor them.

98
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:17,883
I thought you'd say that.

99
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:37,652
No man controls my destiny.

100
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,572
Especially not one who attacks downwind
and stinks of garlic.

101
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:48,412
Come!

102
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:53,417
Our fighting days are done.

103
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:56,837
By nightfall,
we'll celebrate with my father.

104
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,176
You understand, of course...

105
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:05,512
I had to try.

106
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,472
I would have succeeded.

107
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:16,356
Why must you walk in back of me?

108
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:19,692
In your country, am I not the infidel?

109
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:24,780
It seems safer to appear as your slave
rather than your equal.

110
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,034
For an infidel you have
uncommon clarity of thinking.

111
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,952
You tell me nothing of yourself.

112
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,538
Your name, Azeem. What does it mean?

113
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,081
Great One.

114
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:37,459
Really? Did you give yourself this name?

115
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:41,505
It's a joke!

116
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,803
Azeem the Great One, I am home!

117
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,475
Look!

118
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,728
Mistletoe!

119
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:02,191
Many a maid has lost her resolve to me
thanks to this!

120
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:07,196
In my country, we talk to our women.

121
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:10,324
We do not drug them with plants.

122
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:12,743
What do you know of women?

123
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,082
Where I come from, Christian...

124
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:22,461
there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man's mind so...

125
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:25,214
that he would willingly die for them.

126
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,634
Wait. Is that why you were
to be executed?

127
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:32,220
Because of a woman?

128
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:37,642
That's it, isn't it?

129
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:39,436
That's it!

130
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,316
It is close to sunset.

131
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,735
You painted old dog! Who was she?

132
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,112
The mullah's daughter?

133
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:55,242
Another man's wife?

134
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:58,496
What's her name?

135
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:03,042
Is there no sun in this cursed country?

136
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,752
Which way is east?

137
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:07,254
-Her name?
-East!

138
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,673
Her name?

139
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,012
Jasmina.

140
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:18,181
That way.

141
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,350
You are sure?

142
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:23,186
I'd know blindfolded.
I'm five miles from home.

143
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,359
Was she worth it?

144
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:34,030
Worth dying for.

145
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:28,874
You're dog's meat, son!

146
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,589
Come down here! Down!

147
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,924
You're not playing by the rules.

148
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,635
Deer don't climb trees.

149
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:43,847
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

150
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:46,266
Shall we teach him to fly?

151
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:49,185
Get him down.

152
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:51,980
Hold!

153
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:58,277
What manner of creature is so fearsome
it takes six men to attack it?

154
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:01,572
Stand down. It's no affair of yours.

155
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,449
Have we treed the devil?

156
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:04,909
Let's see.

157
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:09,246
A small boy, a truly dangerous animal.

158
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,750
This boy killed one of the Sheriff
of Nottingham's deer.

159
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,169
You starve us! We needed the meat.

160
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:19,131
I advise you to move on.
This is the Sheriff's land.

161
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:20,590
Wrong.

162
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:22,801
It's my land and my tree.

163
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:24,886
Whatever's in it also belongs to me.

164
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:32,644
Might I have the pleasure of your name
before I have you run through?

165
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,396
Robin of Locksley.

166
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,489
Welcome home.

167
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:48,534
Kill him!

168
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,708
Time to redeem that vow!

169
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,419
Unleash the hounds!

170
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,090
Get off your damn knees!

171
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:27,738
Be so kind as to give me your name
before I run you through.

172
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:31,700
Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's cousin.

173
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:35,955
That bastard was poaching deer.

174
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,289
Poaching?

175
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,167
Isn't it a greater crime to starve a family?

176
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:42,961
Go on, Locksley.

177
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:45,756
Go on.

178
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:50,218
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

179
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:52,804
Get off my land.

180
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:03,815
Tell Nottingham what happens
when his scum pick on children.

181
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,199
You travel 10,000 miles to save my life
then leave me to be butchered!

182
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:16,452
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

183
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,371
Which does not include prayer times...

184
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:22,082
or anytime I'm outnumbered six to one!

185
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:23,834
You whine like a mule.

186
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:26,878
You are still alive.

187
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:36,054
Have no fear. Come down.

188
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,937
Is it true? Did you kill a deer?

189
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,647
Hundreds.

190
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:53,446
You scared him.

191
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,370
Interesting place, this...

192
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:03,330
England.

193
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,853
The Sheriff's not to be disturbed.

194
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,071
Cousin!

195
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,617
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

196
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:47,706
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people.

197
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,541
Who told you to cover up?

198
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,211
His name?

199
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,463
Robin of Locksley.

200
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,340
The prodigal son returns.

201
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,135
He's a whelp! This girl could best him.

202
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,053
Put it there!

203
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,894
This "whelp" bested four of my men.

204
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,064
Your men were probably drunk.

205
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,235
Yet you survived, Cousin.

206
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,320
I barely survived.

207
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,077
Captains of lslam.

208
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,081
I'm sure it would take an army
to match these rogues.

209
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:35,836
I trust Locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning.

210
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,007
Time for portents, Cousin.

211
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:53,519
Mortianna?

212
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:11,662
Shut up!

213
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,800
You called, madam?

214
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:57,831
What do you see?

215
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,338
-The son of a dead man.
-Locksley!

216
00:23:04,796 --> 00:23:06,256
Does he affect us?

217
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:08,717
He precedes the Lionheart.

218
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:12,887
If King Richard returns from the Crusades,
it could prove awkward.

219
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:14,806
It would soften the barons' spines.

220
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:17,433
-Soon?
-Make haste.

221
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,353
But my plan is still intact?

222
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:25,107
What's wrong?

223
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:28,110
I have seen our death.

224
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:32,448
The painted man! He haunts my dreams.

225
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,035
Adorned with strange foreign markings.

226
00:23:36,744 --> 00:23:38,704
Locksley's companion.

227
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:41,248
Kill him.

228
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:43,709
Kill them both.

229
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:52,509
Father?

230
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:56,846
Father! Anyone here?

231
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,766
Duncan!

232
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:01,935
Father!

233
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:19,618
No!

234
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:22,287
Who is it?

235
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:23,872
My father.

236
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:30,629
Who's there?

237
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,049
Who's there?

238
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:36,051
Master Robin?

239
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:38,595
Is that you?

240
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,847
Duncan?

241
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,474
Praise thee!

242
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,851
I thought God had abandoned us.

243
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:46,561
Duncan, my father--

244
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,146
It's a miracle!

245
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,690
Why didn't you cut him down?

246
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:53,568
-It's a miracle. I never--
-Are you deaf?

247
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:54,777
Easy!

248
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,696
Look at him.

249
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,491
I would have done if I could see.

250
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,872
Who did this to you?

251
00:25:07,456 --> 00:25:09,917
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

252
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,878
The Sheriff and his witch watched.

253
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:15,297
Why?

254
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:19,175
They say the Sheriff captured your father
worshipping the devil.

255
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,679
That he signed a confession
before the Bishop.

256
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:27,016
That's not possible.

257
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,353
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

258
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,523
Did you believe the charges?

259
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:37,860
Not even when they took my eyes.

260
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,039
We must go.

261
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:56,795
He loved you to the end.

262
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:01,049
He never gave up hope of your return.

263
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:03,009
I should have been here.

264
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,473
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

265
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:12,977
He said it was vanity to force others
to our religion.

266
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:15,980
But you must flee now.

267
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:19,609
Head south to safety.
Gisborne will surely seek revenge.

268
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,319
I hear you, Duncan.

269
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:25,239
You should go home.

270
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,742
My world is turned upside down here.

271
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,329
I cannot ask you to come with me.

272
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:36,083
Alone, Christian,
you will only get yourself killed.

273
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,543
Besides...

274
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,297
there is nothing left for me to go home to.

275
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:50,346
I will not rest until my father is avenged!

276
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,019
I swear it...

277
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:58,855
by my own blood.

278
00:27:10,824 --> 00:27:12,451
What is this place?

279
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:14,286
Peter's home.

280
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:17,414
It's nearly six years since we left together.

281
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:20,542
We'll find food and shelter here.

282
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:26,089
No beggars!

283
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:39,143
Tell the mistress Robin of Locksley's
at her door.

284
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:41,145
Her ladyship's not here.

285
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:44,607
Is the child Marian in?

286
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:47,652
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

287
00:27:51,697 --> 00:27:54,408
The hospitality here
is as warm as the weather.

288
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:58,912
-It's a joke.
-Really?

289
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:00,831
Leave your weapons.

290
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,502
Just you!

291
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,143
Wait here.

292
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:24,937
Right here?

293
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:33,904
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

294
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:39,118
Were it not for their ungodly ways
Master Robin would never have left.

295
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:45,582
What manner of name is "Azeem"?

296
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:47,876
Irish? Cornish?

297
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:50,837
Moorish.

298
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:56,384
Who are you?

299
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,555
Robin of Locksley.

300
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:02,515
You lie. Robin is dead.

301
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:04,684
Step into the light.

302
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:11,816
Turn around.

303
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:18,072
Am I to dance next?

304
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,618
Who are you?

305
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:24,328
I am the maid Marian.

306
00:29:24,453 --> 00:29:26,997
Show yourself,
for we knew each other well.

307
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:39,718
The years have...

308
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,178
been kind.

309
00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:43,388
Thank you.

310
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:48,851
We must guard against outlaws
who would kidnap a relative of the King.

311
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:51,771
You can see I am not one of those.

312
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,606
Perhaps.

313
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:56,776
Now remove yourself from here.

314
00:29:58,652 --> 00:30:01,614
I would, but I'm sworn to protect you.

315
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:04,074
Protect me?

316
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:07,119
Robin of Locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully.

317
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:13,542
Besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

318
00:30:14,668 --> 00:30:15,877
Marian, wait!

319
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:21,800
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

320
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:36,063
Point me toward danger! I'm ready!

321
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:14,142
Hello, Marian.

322
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:24,068
His last thoughts were of you.

323
00:31:29,573 --> 00:31:30,866
Oh, Peter!

324
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:36,330
I'm sorry, Marian.

325
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:38,832
I'm sorry.

326
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:44,004
How do I know you didn't abandon him
to save yourself?

327
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,008
No one feels his loss more than l.

328
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:51,886
Next time I'm in London,
I'll give my mother your condolences.

329
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,308
I would think for your safety
you would join her.

330
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:00,728
I have no interest in life at court.

331
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:03,814
All that gossip-mongering
and currying favor.

332
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,151
But you're alone here.

333
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,361
Hardly.

334
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:12,239
These years have left us many in need.

335
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:18,078
While you and my brother played heroes,
Nottingham plundered the shire.

336
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:20,038
You still have your lands.

337
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:25,001
I give them no excuse to take them.

338
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,548
I am the King's cousin. I must look after
these people until his return.

339
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,855
My purpose in coming
was not to hurt you.

340
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:50,860
I swore to your brother
I would protect you.

341
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,029
You cannot replace my brother.

342
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,617
I don't want to replace him.

343
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:02,371
I return to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered.

344
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,666
The only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old, blind man.

345
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,297
All I remember of you is a spoiled bully...

346
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:15,133
who used to burn my hair as a child.

347
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:20,555
Please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man.

348
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:29,063
Whatever happened between you
and your father, you mustn't believe...

349
00:33:30,106 --> 00:33:31,982
what they accused him of.

350
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:33,651
I don't.

351
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,538
Look!

352
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:14,190
How did your uneducated kind
ever take Jerusalem?

353
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:16,150
God knows.

354
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,485
What is it?

355
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:29,037
-What is it?
-Nottingham's soldiers.

356
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:31,206
Here? Is this your protection?

357
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:34,501
I killed some of the Sheriff's men.

358
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:37,837
I fear I have placed you in danger.

359
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:40,799
I can take care of myself. Just go!

360
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:42,884
No, that's my horse!

361
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:44,719
A magnificent animal!

362
00:34:52,518 --> 00:34:54,812
-Go!
-I'm sworn to protect you.

363
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:57,565
No more boyish gestures.

364
00:34:57,857 --> 00:34:59,233
I'm not leaving.

365
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:05,114
Stop them! They're stealing my horses!

366
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:08,200
You're so kind.

367
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:30,430
Sheltering outlaws?

368
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:32,015
They're thieves.

369
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,267
Lucky he didn't steal your virtue.

370
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:38,437
A crown to the man
who brings me Locksley's head!

371
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,105
Have we lost them?

372
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:25,149
No!

373
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,778
My horse carries two. Yours is lame.
We can't outrun them.

374
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:32,656
Leave me, Master Robin!
I slow your escape.

375
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,410
We'll lose them in the forest.

376
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,328
Sherwood Forest is haunted.

377
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,457
We take our chances with the ghosts,
or become ghosts ourselves.

378
00:37:05,062 --> 00:37:06,188
Come on!

379
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:07,898
There're only three of them!

380
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,775
It's not the men we fear.

381
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,694
It's the evil spirits.

382
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:13,654
Robin of the Hood!

383
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:16,281
Son of a devil worshipper!

384
00:37:16,782 --> 00:37:18,659
Your father died a coward...

385
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:21,495
cursing you and squealing like a stuck pig!

386
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:25,540
You'll bring no justice
to your father by dying.

387
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,573
There are your ghosts.

388
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:02,242
Wind chimes.

389
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,786
A child's toy put to good use.

390
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,832
You scare easily, my painted Moor.

391
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,879
This forest has eyes.

392
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:16,840
I swear it.

393
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:39,653
In my dreams alone
have I imagined such a place.

394
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:43,824
Then imagine a way to cross it.

395
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:17,231
There's hope!

396
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,199
There was a rich man from Nottingham
Who tried to cross the river

397
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,868
What a dope
He tripped on a rope

398
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,954
Now Iook at him shiver!

399
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:35,123
Beg for mercy, rich man!

400
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,378
I beg of no man.

401
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:55,059
This is our river, and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax.

402
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,853
I will pay no tax.

403
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,315
As you can see, I have nothing.

404
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,485
Not even my sword.

405
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,861
Bollocks!

406
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,156
Any man who travels with two servants...

407
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,743
and claims he's got no money is either...

408
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,328
a fool or a liar.

409
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,246
Yeah, he's a liar!

410
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,457
Who are you?

411
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,250
John Little...

412
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:23,503
bestman of the woods.

413
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:31,427
Well, bestman, you lead this rabble?

414
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,555
Yes, I do, mate.

415
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:39,727
And if you want to travel
through Sherwood Forest, it'll cost you...

416
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,771
that gold medallion.

417
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:48,569
This is sacred to me.

418
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,238
It's sacred to us, too, matey.

419
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,158
It will feed us for a month.

420
00:40:55,784 --> 00:40:57,494
You must fight me for it.

421
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:00,580
Love to, mate.

422
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:08,296
Be careful, Father.

423
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:10,924
He walloped 12 of the Sheriff's men.

424
00:41:11,049 --> 00:41:12,175
Is that so?

425
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,595
Reckon I'll enjoy this.

426
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:20,683
He's your father?

427
00:41:54,215 --> 00:41:55,842
He's drowning!

428
00:41:57,594 --> 00:41:58,886
Lost something?

429
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:03,474
Thanks for the taxes.

430
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:06,644
The little rich boy's lost for words!

431
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,689
Any great ideas?

432
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,400
Get up! Move faster!

433
00:42:14,193 --> 00:42:16,320
"Move faster." Great idea.

434
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,001
We're not through yet.

435
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:32,836
All right, my old cocker.

436
00:42:33,545 --> 00:42:35,588
You want another good walloping?

437
00:42:35,964 --> 00:42:37,215
You'll have it.

438
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:52,104
I've made it past the gate, John Little.

439
00:42:52,313 --> 00:42:54,523
Or should I call you "Little John"?

440
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:56,233
Hit him, Father! Wallop him!

441
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:21,299
Swimming time again, old chum.

442
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:38,649
Where is he? Do you see him?

443
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:53,080
It's a bloody shame!

444
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:55,749
He was a brave lad!

445
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:06,092
-Do you yield?
-I can't bloody swim!

446
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:10,430
-Do you yield?
-Yes!

447
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:13,599
Good. Now put your feet down.

448
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,856
I'll be buggered!

449
00:44:22,358 --> 00:44:25,110
-The medallion.
-Give me your name first.

450
00:44:26,653 --> 00:44:28,113
Robin of Locksley.

451
00:44:29,156 --> 00:44:30,866
Well, Robin of Locksley...

452
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:35,120
you got balls of solid rock. Come on.

453
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:42,627
That's Much, the miller's son,
Harold Brownwell...

454
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:47,215
that stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the lads call him "Bull."

455
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:50,385
Because you're short?

456
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:53,638
It's because I'm so long!

457
00:44:58,517 --> 00:44:59,602
Save it!

458
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:01,479
Save it for the ladies.

459
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:03,939
Give him some mead.

460
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:09,486
I made that myself.

461
00:45:11,613 --> 00:45:14,741
Has English hospitality changed so
in six years...

462
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,744
that a friend of mine's not welcome?

463
00:45:18,036 --> 00:45:19,913
But he's a savage, sire!

464
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:22,791
That he is.

465
00:45:25,043 --> 00:45:26,795
But no more than you or l.

466
00:45:29,797 --> 00:45:31,507
And don't call me "sire."

467
00:45:33,635 --> 00:45:36,095
With regret, I must decline.

468
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:39,682
Allah forbids it.

469
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:41,183
Your loss!

470
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:43,936
Why are so many of you in hiding?

471
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:45,938
We're all outlaws.

472
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,857
Got prices on our heads.

473
00:45:48,357 --> 00:45:49,608
Even the lad.

474
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:53,237
He's a blasted Sheriff.
He says we owe him taxes.

475
00:45:54,655 --> 00:45:58,200
Your ghost will only keep his men
at bay so long.

476
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:01,787
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

477
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:09,377
We can fight back.

478
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:14,966
Did I crack your noble head?

479
00:46:16,342 --> 00:46:18,302
These are all good lads here...

480
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:21,389
with hearts of oak, but they're farmers.

481
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:25,226
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

482
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:28,687
They say the Sheriff was raised by a witch.

483
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:32,149
She knows every man's thoughts.

484
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:34,485
-She flies.
-That's codswallop!

485
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:37,488
The rich son of a devil worshipper...

486
00:46:37,613 --> 00:46:39,823
cares what happens to outlaw peasants?

487
00:46:39,948 --> 00:46:41,908
My lord was kind and generous!

488
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:44,494
Who dares believe him capable?

489
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:47,664
My father was no devil worshipper.

490
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:52,085
I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

491
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,381
But he's right.

492
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,677
I was a rich man's son.

493
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:05,431
When I killed the Sheriff's men...

494
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,143
I became an outlaw like you.

495
00:47:09,268 --> 00:47:10,936
You are nothing like us.

496
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,274
That's Will Scarlett.

497
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:18,652
Take no notice. He's full of piss and wind.

498
00:47:20,154 --> 00:47:21,572
Come on, drink up.

499
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:24,616
Stop talking so much rubbish.

500
00:47:24,992 --> 00:47:28,245
This is the best
we simple men can expect.

501
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,455
Here we're safe.

502
00:47:31,831 --> 00:47:34,542
Here we are kings.

503
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:01,610
Too much mead, friend?

504
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:03,737
Forgive me, I overslept.

505
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:05,739
Rest yourself.

506
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,750
What day is it?

507
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,501
Sunday, I think.

508
00:48:20,795 --> 00:48:23,339
Do they still give alms
to the poor at mass?

509
00:48:23,464 --> 00:48:24,674
That they do.

510
00:48:24,966 --> 00:48:28,261
These days the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

511
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:46,820
Well, my other god calls.

512
00:48:48,322 --> 00:48:50,991
Don't upset yourself, Mortianna.

513
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,326
Appearances are important to that lot...

514
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:54,911
especially on a Sunday.

515
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:58,456
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

516
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:02,544
Although...

517
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,339
frankly, sometimes...

518
00:49:08,383 --> 00:49:10,301
I can't see much difference.

519
00:49:13,638 --> 00:49:17,892
Did my parents truly tell you
to instruct me in all this?

520
00:49:19,477 --> 00:49:20,853
Their dying wish.

521
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:04,436
We beseech thy blessing, Lord...

522
00:50:04,895 --> 00:50:09,024
on all your people, but most especially...

523
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:12,778
on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

524
00:50:13,904 --> 00:50:17,658
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

525
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:19,534
our glorious city.

526
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:22,704
Grant him also the strength...

527
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:26,124
to bring to justice the lawless men...

528
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,960
who would threaten its safety...

529
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:32,297
and prosperity...and the judgment...

530
00:50:32,422 --> 00:50:33,881
to punish them...

531
00:50:34,507 --> 00:50:36,884
in your name. Amen.

532
00:50:40,263 --> 00:50:41,430
Go in peace.

533
00:50:44,558 --> 00:50:46,727
Father, please help me.

534
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,106
Lady mother, the children are starving.

535
00:50:51,607 --> 00:50:53,901
Lady, I'm a poor cripple.

536
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:55,819
-Thank you.
-God bless you, ma'am.

537
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:58,363
-That's all I have.
-God bless you, ma'am.

538
00:51:16,547 --> 00:51:18,841
Alms for a blind man, milady?

539
00:51:20,384 --> 00:51:22,762
For one who cannot see your beauty?

540
00:51:26,432 --> 00:51:28,350
-Hello.
-What are you doing here?

541
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:31,437
Searching my soul.

542
00:51:32,563 --> 00:51:35,024
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

543
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:37,860
You prefer Nottingham's company?

544
00:51:38,402 --> 00:51:40,946
-There's a price on your head.
-How much?

545
00:51:41,071 --> 00:51:42,698
One hundred gold pieces.

546
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,199
Is that all?

547
00:51:44,658 --> 00:51:47,035
I shall have to annoy the Sheriff more.

548
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:48,954
Soon it will be 1,000.

549
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,456
For 1,000, I'd turn you in myself.

550
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:54,209
Nottingham is mounting an army.

551
00:51:54,334 --> 00:51:58,213
He has every blacksmith in the county
making swords and armor.

552
00:51:58,755 --> 00:52:00,715
-What's his plan?
-I don't know.

553
00:52:01,007 --> 00:52:03,217
There's no limit to his ambitions.

554
00:52:06,012 --> 00:52:08,389
-Thank you.
-Quickly. Go!

555
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:11,726
-Do something for me.
-What?

556
00:52:12,184 --> 00:52:13,477
Take a bath.

557
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:15,020
A bath?

558
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:37,751
These are my private chambers, my son.

559
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:42,422
I have priests who would hear
your confession.

560
00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:52,682
I see the boy I knew in the man before me.

561
00:52:54,266 --> 00:52:55,768
Welcome home, Robin.

562
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:00,773
You shine like the sun, milady.

563
00:53:01,148 --> 00:53:03,108
You've been meeting with Robin.

564
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:07,613
My cousin tells me the knave deprived you
of some horses.

565
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:10,907
Yes, a most disagreeable experience.

566
00:53:11,074 --> 00:53:13,535
And for inflicting that upon you...

567
00:53:13,827 --> 00:53:16,621
I'll hang him from the walls by his entrails.

568
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,039
I'd like to see that.

569
00:53:18,164 --> 00:53:23,044
If you'd bring your household within
the city, I could attend to your needs.

570
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:26,964
Thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

571
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:32,136
Then perhaps you'd do me the honor...

572
00:53:32,261 --> 00:53:36,557
of accepting a token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

573
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:43,981
King Richard will be moved to hear
of your concern for my welfare.

574
00:53:46,942 --> 00:53:50,404
I'm afraid the King has many enemies
abroad and at home.

575
00:53:50,696 --> 00:53:52,698
I fear for his safe return.

576
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:55,409
Fear not, dear Sheriff. He will return.

577
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,829
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

578
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:08,588
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the Dark One.

579
00:54:09,631 --> 00:54:13,593
Because his answer vexed me
so grievously.

580
00:54:14,886 --> 00:54:16,012
He said...

581
00:54:16,804 --> 00:54:20,766
he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

582
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:32,903
You lie!

583
00:54:39,868 --> 00:54:43,163
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

584
00:55:01,806 --> 00:55:02,932
Locksley!

585
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:05,476
I'll cut your heart out...

586
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,269
with a spoon!

587
00:55:08,103 --> 00:55:09,355
Then it begins.

588
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:27,998
He's stealing the damn horse.

589
00:55:32,043 --> 00:55:33,836
Close that gate!

590
00:55:35,755 --> 00:55:38,257
Close the gate!
He's stolen the damn horse!

591
00:55:57,317 --> 00:55:59,111
What are you looking at?

592
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:20,715
Water!

593
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,467
-Thank you.
-For the animal.

594
00:56:24,093 --> 00:56:27,638
How can I protect you
if I know not where you go?

595
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,850
You hardly raise a finger
when you do know...

596
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,893
Great One.

597
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,479
I prefer to have the choice.

598
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:37,648
You've stolen the Sheriff's horse?

599
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:40,734
You've stirred up a hornet's nest now!

600
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:43,737
-Are you afraid?
-Yeah, a little.

601
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:47,449
So is the Sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

602
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,493
You fool! You started a war!

603
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,245
We're already at war.

604
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:56,374
Bread.

605
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:01,796
I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes...

606
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:03,673
and hunts our children.

607
00:57:04,882 --> 00:57:06,551
You planning to join us?

608
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:10,054
No, to lead you.

609
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:18,354
These are simple people.

610
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:20,606
They are not warriors.

611
00:57:21,315 --> 00:57:24,318
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

612
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:28,196
You forget yourself. I do not ask
for your company or council.

613
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:34,452
Why a spoon, Cousin? Why not an axe?

614
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:38,540
Because it's dull, you twit! It'll hurt more!

615
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:42,043
I want this brigand found.

616
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:44,379
Starve them out!

617
00:57:44,671 --> 00:57:47,381
Slaughter their.... No, take their livestock.

618
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:50,801
I want Locksley's own people fighting
to bring his head in.

619
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,888
Perhaps we could create a name for him.

620
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,849
Something to drive fear into the populace.

621
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,894
Maybe "Locksley the Lethal"
or "Wreaking Robin."

622
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,814
I want him dead by the full moon,
before the barons come back.

623
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,066
Now, sew!

624
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,696
And keep the stitches small.

625
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,174
He's not here.

626
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,469
Where's your mate, the man called Little?

627
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:38,431
-He died last winter.
-Burn it down!

628
00:58:45,979 --> 00:58:49,066
Leave the sow. Her young
will feed us through winter.

629
00:58:49,399 --> 00:58:51,318
You've heard of the Sherwood Bandit?

630
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,153
Robin of the Hood? Yes.

631
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:56,239
Pray he is brought to us before winter.

632
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:04,039
Over here!

633
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:16,384
Oh, John!

634
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:20,554
They burned it! All of it!

635
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,308
Where is this Robin Hood?

636
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,393
He's there!

637
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:30,272
Look what they've done!

638
00:59:35,235 --> 00:59:37,529
If it's fame you seek, Christian...

639
00:59:38,113 --> 00:59:40,073
I think you have it.

640
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:45,578
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

641
00:59:45,954 --> 00:59:47,664
Nottingham is trying to divide us.

642
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,499
We are divided, rich boy.

643
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:52,335
I'm not as blind as that old man.

644
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,421
You're still trying to be lord of the manor.

645
00:59:55,755 --> 00:59:58,341
I heard the Sheriff now values your neck...

646
00:59:58,466 --> 01:00:00,468
at 500 gold pieces.

647
01:00:02,011 --> 01:00:03,971
I say we take him in.

648
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:09,977
You think the Sheriff
will give everything back after I'm gone?

649
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,063
He'll give us the reward and our pardons.

650
01:00:13,188 --> 01:00:14,356
Wrong!

651
01:00:16,942 --> 01:00:19,111
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

652
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,905
What would you have us do?

653
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:25,325
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and bare hands?

654
01:00:26,493 --> 01:00:27,786
If needs be.

655
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:32,415
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you.

656
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:34,918
Courage.

657
01:00:43,175 --> 01:00:44,218
Look out!

658
01:00:59,191 --> 01:01:00,484
Thank you, Wulf.

659
01:01:02,027 --> 01:01:03,570
You wish to end this?

660
01:01:04,196 --> 01:01:05,739
You wish to go home?

661
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:09,451
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves...

662
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:12,620
and face that the price may be dear.

663
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,123
I would rather die...

664
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:17,667
than spend my life in hiding.

665
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,086
The Sheriff calls us outlaws.

666
01:01:21,337 --> 01:01:22,922
But I say we are free.

667
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:27,343
And one free man defending his home
is more powerful...

668
01:01:27,593 --> 01:01:29,887
than ten hired soldiers.

669
01:01:32,306 --> 01:01:34,183
The Crusades taught me that.

670
01:01:37,436 --> 01:01:40,022
I'll make no promises save one:

671
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:45,527
If you truly believe in your hearts
that you are free...

672
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,363
then we can win.

673
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,490
They got armor!

674
01:01:51,783 --> 01:01:53,410
They got armor, Bull?

675
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,830
Even this boy can learn
to find the chinks in armor.

676
01:01:56,996 --> 01:01:58,706
But we ain't got no food!

677
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:03,252
What do we need that the forest
cannot provide? We have food.

678
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,129
Wood for weapons.

679
01:02:05,963 --> 01:02:08,216
We'll find safety in the trees.

680
01:02:08,466 --> 01:02:10,092
What about our kin?

681
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,012
Sheriff took all they got!

682
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:18,225
Then, by God, we take it back.

683
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:05,161
What's the meaning of this?

684
01:04:05,703 --> 01:04:09,123
A woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations.

685
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:11,501
How dare you!

686
01:04:21,552 --> 01:04:24,388
Please don't take that! Don't take that!

687
01:04:24,722 --> 01:04:26,515
They belong to our Lord.

688
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:29,727
Now they belong to my Lord Sheriff!

689
01:04:43,573 --> 01:04:44,783
Give it back!

690
01:04:46,743 --> 01:04:47,744
Good.

691
01:04:48,078 --> 01:04:52,874
Tell the Sheriff for every harm he does
these people I will repay him tenfold.

692
01:05:02,591 --> 01:05:04,218
Something vexes thee?

693
01:05:15,938 --> 01:05:17,147
What the devil....

694
01:05:17,272 --> 01:05:19,024
It's a hot day, friend...

695
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:21,985
to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse.

696
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:24,070
The Sheriff will hear of this!

697
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,868
I truly hope so.

698
01:05:40,128 --> 01:05:41,671
Buy yourself a new sow.

699
01:05:41,796 --> 01:05:43,422
God bless you, Fanny.

700
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:46,175
And God bless Robin Hood!

701
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,679
We reckon he's nicked...

702
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:54,808
three to four million
in the last five months.

703
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,978
Raise the bounty on his head.

704
01:05:58,479 --> 01:05:59,813
25,000 crowns.

705
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:03,317
Begging your pardon,
it won't do no good...

706
01:06:03,442 --> 01:06:04,860
how much you raise it.

707
01:06:04,985 --> 01:06:06,445
Why is that?

708
01:06:06,653 --> 01:06:09,072
Because of the poor.

709
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:11,491
He gives them what he takes.

710
01:06:11,825 --> 01:06:14,494
Well, sire...they love him.

711
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:19,415
Just a minute.

712
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:23,002
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket...

713
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:25,880
forcing me to hurt the public...

714
01:06:26,214 --> 01:06:28,090
and they love him for it?

715
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:30,509
Yes.

716
01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:37,099
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans.

717
01:06:37,224 --> 01:06:39,518
No more merciful beheadings.

718
01:06:40,227 --> 01:06:42,312
And call off Christmas!

719
01:06:43,897 --> 01:06:45,482
The treasury is empty.

720
01:06:45,857 --> 01:06:48,276
Day and night people plague my door...

721
01:06:48,402 --> 01:06:52,113
whining for tax relief and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

722
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:54,741
"We can't pay thee
what the highwayman's taken."

723
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:56,993
It's the shortest route to London!

724
01:06:57,243 --> 01:06:59,537
It's the only route to London.

725
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,167
Sir Guy's patrols have found nothing, sire?

726
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:06,502
No camp. Nothing!

727
01:07:08,379 --> 01:07:12,550
This hooded viper simply slithers
into the forest.

728
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:15,052
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.

729
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:17,179
You, 10:45.

730
01:07:17,596 --> 01:07:19,014
And bring a friend.

731
01:07:36,531 --> 01:07:37,949
A tongue offends thee.

732
01:07:39,784 --> 01:07:40,785
Whose?

733
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:42,871
One who writes all.

734
01:07:43,663 --> 01:07:44,664
"One who...."

735
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,669
That horrible little scribe? His tongue?

736
01:07:49,794 --> 01:07:51,003
Cut it out.

737
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,866
How many?

738
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:23,576
Twenty.

739
01:08:24,077 --> 01:08:25,078
Twenty!

740
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:26,746
How many?

741
01:08:28,414 --> 01:08:29,540
Five.

742
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:32,794
They can't count anyway.

743
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:35,004
Why scare them?

744
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:37,965
And they call me a barbarian.

745
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:47,808
Friar!

746
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,854
It will be more difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet.

747
01:08:52,604 --> 01:08:54,564
Yes, my lord.

748
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:57,234
You pig.

749
01:08:57,526 --> 01:08:59,653
Shut up and help me move this log!

750
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:01,655
This is a tree, not a log!

751
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,448
Shut up and help me!

752
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,533
I have to meet a girl!

753
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:15,918
Men in front, after me.
The rest stay with the wagon!

754
01:09:19,797 --> 01:09:20,923
On to glory!

755
01:09:35,312 --> 01:09:37,481
Bastards! Find them!

756
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:24,693
Welcome to Sherwood, Friar!

757
01:10:51,177 --> 01:10:52,845
Surrender your weapon.

758
01:10:53,721 --> 01:10:56,181
Surrender your weapon
and I'll give you my word...

759
01:10:56,307 --> 01:10:57,558
that you'll go free.

760
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,560
Don't do that.

761
01:11:20,955 --> 01:11:22,915
I'll be buggered!

762
01:11:23,624 --> 01:11:27,253
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

763
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:45,062
Good morning, my reverend friend.

764
01:11:45,812 --> 01:11:49,274
You travel with poor company
when you travel with Nottingham soldiers.

765
01:11:49,816 --> 01:11:51,443
Tax him!

766
01:11:53,987 --> 01:11:57,240
I'm Robin of Locksley.
And my men are thirsty.

767
01:11:59,826 --> 01:12:00,910
Robin Hood!

768
01:12:05,957 --> 01:12:08,334
I mistook you for common thieves!

769
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,254
Kindly let me pass, sir.

770
01:12:11,504 --> 01:12:15,966
Surely the Lord has the charity
to spare a few barrels for good Christians.

771
01:12:18,636 --> 01:12:20,262
We have much to celebrate.

772
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:24,975
If you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew...

773
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:27,144
best me for it!

774
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:37,279
Confess, Robin Hood,
that Friar Tuck is a braver...

775
01:12:37,529 --> 01:12:40,490
holier and wiser man than thou art!

776
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,509
He giveth and he taketh away.

777
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:07,724
Do you yield?

778
01:13:12,062 --> 01:13:14,356
I'd rather roast in hell.

779
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:37,044
I think the Friar's taken us far enough.

780
01:13:41,715 --> 01:13:44,385
Thank you, Lord, for teaching me humility.

781
01:13:54,853 --> 01:13:56,063
Thanks for the beer.

782
01:13:56,188 --> 01:13:58,398
Are these not the meek of the earth?

783
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:01,485
We need an honest man to minister them.

784
01:14:03,069 --> 01:14:04,279
What say you?

785
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:11,995
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

786
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:15,581
-I accept.
-Good.

787
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,584
You won't regret it.

788
01:14:19,252 --> 01:14:20,628
Aye, but you may!

789
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:54,786
We were ambushed, Cousin.

790
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:04,045
Spanish steel.
Much stronger than our native blades.

791
01:15:07,423 --> 01:15:08,549
Any losses?

792
01:15:09,133 --> 01:15:10,217
Some.

793
01:15:14,138 --> 01:15:16,432
In truth, all of them.

794
01:15:17,182 --> 01:15:18,475
And the gold?

795
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,768
Taken.

796
01:15:21,561 --> 01:15:22,646
Robin Hood?

797
01:15:23,814 --> 01:15:26,108
They were woodsmen, Cousin.

798
01:15:29,569 --> 01:15:30,695
Robin Hood.

799
01:15:32,614 --> 01:15:33,948
I tried.

800
01:15:37,952 --> 01:15:39,412
I tried!

801
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:42,206
We must be strong.

802
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:45,293
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

803
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:48,462
And I can't allow a lieutenant...

804
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:50,756
to fail me.

805
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,647
At least I didn't use a spoon.

806
01:16:11,276 --> 01:16:12,611
It's good steel.

807
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,623
Take the one on the left.

808
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:26,958
Which is left?

809
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,504
-Which are you taking?
-What do you mean?

810
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,799
If you take the left one, I take the right.

811
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,842
Which one's that?

812
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,427
The one next to....

813
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:41,430
Just grab them.

814
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,850
-Now?
-Now!

815
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:49,229
Donation, please.

816
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:52,107
Donation? For what?

817
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,196
For passage through Sherwood.

818
01:16:58,321 --> 01:16:59,406
Very well.

819
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:01,783
Come and get it.

820
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:10,500
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us!

821
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,293
It's me job, milady.

822
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:14,670
Who is your employer?

823
01:17:14,795 --> 01:17:16,088
Robin Hood.

824
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:21,969
I must see him at once.

825
01:17:24,555 --> 01:17:26,181
I'm trying to stop them!

826
01:17:26,473 --> 01:17:28,267
You can't go down there!

827
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,771
He's not expecting you!

828
01:17:32,896 --> 01:17:34,940
My lady's intrusion is tit for tat.

829
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:37,526
-Out of the way, old traps!
-Don't "old traps" me!

830
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:39,527
You can't go down there!

831
01:17:41,654 --> 01:17:43,198
I told you, not down there!

832
01:17:47,827 --> 01:17:48,953
Oh, I say!

833
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:50,538
Cover your eyes.

834
01:18:03,133 --> 01:18:04,551
You could've said!

835
01:18:09,515 --> 01:18:10,974
You have visitors!

836
01:18:15,145 --> 01:18:18,231
-Don't look at me. It weren't my fault!
-Marian, you be careful.

837
01:18:18,356 --> 01:18:20,525
-lt was Much!
-lt weren't me!

838
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:27,574
Hello.

839
01:18:30,034 --> 01:18:31,494
What are you doing?

840
01:18:35,706 --> 01:18:37,333
Taking a lady's advice.

841
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:41,462
What happened to your eye?

842
01:18:41,962 --> 01:18:44,089
-We was set upon by ten--
-Twelve!

843
01:18:44,215 --> 01:18:46,717
Fifteen! Large, big lads!

844
01:19:00,772 --> 01:19:02,232
You've been busy.

845
01:19:03,233 --> 01:19:05,944
-We have guests!
-Bring them down.

846
01:19:17,747 --> 01:19:18,873
It works.

847
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:21,083
Kind of.

848
01:19:22,418 --> 01:19:23,919
Of course it works.

849
01:19:28,299 --> 01:19:29,925
Take your time.

850
01:19:34,346 --> 01:19:35,764
That's good, Wulf.

851
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:38,058
Can you do it amidst distraction?

852
01:19:38,642 --> 01:19:40,852
Can you make the shot when you must?

853
01:19:43,772 --> 01:19:45,023
Show him, Wulf.

854
01:19:46,024 --> 01:19:47,025
You can do it.

855
01:19:54,282 --> 01:19:55,575
Can you?

856
01:19:58,161 --> 01:19:59,704
It was a dirty trick.

857
01:20:01,289 --> 01:20:02,707
He's serious, lads.

858
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:04,709
Is the shirt coming off, too?

859
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,231
Well done!

860
01:20:30,066 --> 01:20:33,778
This is grain, which any fool can eat...

861
01:20:34,571 --> 01:20:39,367
but for which the Lord intended
a more divine means of consumption.

862
01:20:39,826 --> 01:20:44,122
Let us give praise to our Maker
and glory to his bounty...

863
01:20:44,413 --> 01:20:46,082
by learning about...

864
01:20:46,249 --> 01:20:47,541
beer!

865
01:20:54,924 --> 01:20:56,550
Did you bring me here to brag?

866
01:21:00,596 --> 01:21:02,556
This is blood money, Marian.

867
01:21:03,015 --> 01:21:06,476
Intended to bribe King Richard's enemies
to unite against him.

868
01:21:07,769 --> 01:21:09,396
We intercepted it.

869
01:21:11,148 --> 01:21:13,233
-Who would....
-Nottingham.

870
01:21:14,192 --> 01:21:16,569
Nottingham would not challenge the King.

871
01:21:16,695 --> 01:21:18,655
The King's not here to be challenged.

872
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:21,574
While he's away he may lose his country.

873
01:21:26,954 --> 01:21:29,248
You thought I was keeping it all.

874
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,251
Didn't you?

875
01:21:35,629 --> 01:21:37,590
A contribution to your cause.

876
01:21:37,882 --> 01:21:39,925
-Keep it.
-lt will fetch a great price.

877
01:21:40,634 --> 01:21:42,177
It's not dear to me.

878
01:21:42,886 --> 01:21:43,887
It is.

879
01:21:44,221 --> 01:21:45,264
It's not.

880
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:48,684
I'm saying everything wrong.

881
01:21:51,353 --> 01:21:52,395
Cheers.

882
01:21:59,235 --> 01:22:00,945
How do I get down?

883
01:22:05,575 --> 01:22:06,784
Wait!

884
01:22:09,746 --> 01:22:11,664
We don't go that way anymore.

885
01:22:12,164 --> 01:22:13,833
I'm happy to hear that.

886
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,042
Grab on.

887
01:22:18,754 --> 01:22:20,548
We have a rule here.

888
01:22:20,923 --> 01:22:24,718
Once someone has seen the way
to our camp, that person cannot leave.

889
01:22:25,427 --> 01:22:27,304
Too many lives are at stake.

890
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,141
That's why Sarah and I were blindfolded.

891
01:22:34,853 --> 01:22:36,980
Will you join us for dinner?

892
01:22:38,064 --> 01:22:39,065
Perhaps.

893
01:22:57,959 --> 01:22:59,418
Salaam, little one.

894
01:22:59,877 --> 01:23:01,170
Did God paint you?

895
01:23:01,295 --> 01:23:03,088
Did God paint me?

896
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:07,217
For certain.

897
01:23:07,551 --> 01:23:08,677
Why?

898
01:23:10,804 --> 01:23:12,264
Because...

899
01:23:13,056 --> 01:23:15,434
Allah loves wondrous variety.

900
01:23:17,853 --> 01:23:20,897
You see, that is why your hand is brown...

901
01:23:21,189 --> 01:23:22,190
and your--

902
01:23:22,774 --> 01:23:25,902
Keep thy heathen words
away from the ears of this innocent...

903
01:23:26,611 --> 01:23:28,029
or you'll answer to me.

904
01:23:29,155 --> 01:23:30,698
You know nothing of our God.

905
01:23:34,118 --> 01:23:36,788
Is not Allah the God of Abraham...

906
01:23:37,788 --> 01:23:38,789
as is your God?

907
01:23:39,206 --> 01:23:41,709
Don't trick me with twists
of the devil's tongue.

908
01:23:41,834 --> 01:23:42,960
Come, child! Come!

909
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:51,969
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman...

910
01:23:53,303 --> 01:23:56,473
has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth?

911
01:23:57,307 --> 01:24:00,685
I've seen knights panic
at the first hint of battle.

912
01:24:01,728 --> 01:24:05,690
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body...

913
01:24:06,816 --> 01:24:08,610
to defend a dying horse.

914
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,280
Nobility's not a birthright.

915
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,950
It's defined by one's actions.

916
01:24:18,327 --> 01:24:20,621
It's interesting to hear you say that.

917
01:24:21,163 --> 01:24:22,290
I didn't.

918
01:24:22,999 --> 01:24:24,375
My father did.

919
01:24:29,004 --> 01:24:31,674
Did the Holy Quest
erase your hatred of him?

920
01:24:31,924 --> 01:24:33,217
I don't know.

921
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:39,640
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

922
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,810
I was lost after my mother died.

923
01:24:44,269 --> 01:24:47,731
My father, too. And for a short time
he found comfort...

924
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,025
with another woman.

925
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:51,818
A peasant woman.

926
01:24:54,821 --> 01:24:57,073
I felt he betrayed my mother's memory.

927
01:24:57,198 --> 01:24:58,449
He gave her up?

928
01:25:00,785 --> 01:25:04,288
For the love of a 12-year-old boy
who would never forgive him.

929
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,924
Who says I'm content?

930
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:17,676
I have my plans for the future.

931
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:21,680
A grander scheme than this?

932
01:25:21,805 --> 01:25:23,640
No, a simpler one.

933
01:25:25,058 --> 01:25:27,269
A home...family...

934
01:25:28,311 --> 01:25:29,437
Iove.

935
01:25:29,563 --> 01:25:33,775
Men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

936
01:25:34,234 --> 01:25:36,611
When it doesn't, 'tis a burden to them.

937
01:25:37,403 --> 01:25:38,738
Robin of the Hood...

938
01:25:38,905 --> 01:25:40,573
Prince of Thieves...

939
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:43,951
is he capable of love?

940
01:25:48,664 --> 01:25:49,874
Father!

941
01:25:54,587 --> 01:25:56,297
It's Mother, she's dying!

942
01:26:07,349 --> 01:26:09,309
Your baby has not turned.

943
01:26:10,435 --> 01:26:13,146
It cannot be born without help.

944
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,524
He's the devil's seed
sent to lead us astray.

945
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:18,318
Don't listen! He'll kill her!

946
01:26:18,443 --> 01:26:20,403
If you do not listen to me...

947
01:26:20,778 --> 01:26:23,239
she will die, and the child.

948
01:26:27,034 --> 01:26:28,911
The Friar's done all he can.

949
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:32,665
I suggest you let the Moor try.

950
01:26:36,419 --> 01:26:37,753
So be it.

951
01:26:37,878 --> 01:26:39,505
Then be it on your head!

952
01:26:43,258 --> 01:26:45,719
Get me a needle, thread, water.

953
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:47,596
Hurry!

954
01:26:47,888 --> 01:26:49,848
Come with me, John!

955
01:26:53,226 --> 01:26:54,769
What will you do?

956
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:58,857
I've seen it many times.

957
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:00,608
With horses.

958
01:27:03,194 --> 01:27:04,737
With horses?

959
01:27:07,073 --> 01:27:08,241
Bite down.

960
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:12,203
Help me.

961
01:27:19,418 --> 01:27:20,961
It will be all right.

962
01:27:30,596 --> 01:27:33,390
I tell you, John, the barbarian is killing her.

963
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:40,480
Out of the way, boy!

964
01:27:40,772 --> 01:27:42,482
Quick, take him.

965
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:51,991
What is it?

966
01:28:00,708 --> 01:28:02,418
Your son, milady.

967
01:28:14,054 --> 01:28:15,931
You truly are a Great One.

968
01:28:18,809 --> 01:28:20,435
My son!

969
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:25,607
Look at the lovely little baby.
Isn't he wonderful?

970
01:28:35,742 --> 01:28:38,035
The Lord has taught me a fine lesson.

971
01:28:38,161 --> 01:28:41,289
Though I may think I am godly,
I am not worldly.

972
01:28:41,998 --> 01:28:43,958
Please.

973
01:28:48,587 --> 01:28:53,175
My barbarian friend, let's open a barrel
and try to save each other's souls.

974
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,968
Alas, I am not permitted.

975
01:28:55,093 --> 01:28:57,221
Fine. You talk, I'll drink.

976
01:29:11,943 --> 01:29:13,444
May I have this dance?

977
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:15,530
This lady is spoken for.

978
01:29:58,655 --> 01:29:59,947
Why this way?

979
01:30:01,157 --> 01:30:04,702
So you cannot return
or be forced to tell others the way.

980
01:30:08,998 --> 01:30:11,041
It was good to see you, Marian.

981
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:14,295
It was good to be seen.

982
01:30:16,171 --> 01:30:17,881
I have two favors to ask.

983
01:30:20,551 --> 01:30:21,552
One:

984
01:30:22,344 --> 01:30:23,554
Take Duncan with you.

985
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,972
I fear for his health
with what may lie ahead.

986
01:30:27,474 --> 01:30:29,643
Besides, I grow tired of his bellyaching.

987
01:30:30,393 --> 01:30:32,479
You wish me to leave?

988
01:30:32,771 --> 01:30:34,481
Old friend, listen to me.

989
01:30:35,357 --> 01:30:37,650
Take Marian safely home.

990
01:30:38,359 --> 01:30:40,195
I fear for her safety.

991
01:30:40,528 --> 01:30:42,280
-Of course, sire.
-Good.

992
01:30:51,872 --> 01:30:52,873
Two?

993
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,838
You're King Richard's cousin.

994
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:04,259
You can get word to him
of Nottingham's plan.

995
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:06,970
He would believe you.

996
01:31:07,888 --> 01:31:10,557
If the Sheriff found out, I'd lose all I have.

997
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:14,394
That's true.

998
01:31:16,563 --> 01:31:18,064
Do it for your King.

999
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:20,400
No.

1000
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:25,530
I'll do it for you.

1001
01:31:45,549 --> 01:31:47,217
He fancies you, milady.

1002
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:53,432
I am blind, but some things I can still see.

1003
01:32:11,991 --> 01:32:14,911
In ten days, the barons are coming.

1004
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:18,998
Robin Hood stole what I was to pay
for their allegiance.

1005
01:32:19,165 --> 01:32:23,127
I am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations.

1006
01:32:25,004 --> 01:32:26,630
Tell me, Mortianna...

1007
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:29,258
am I thwarted?

1008
01:32:51,529 --> 01:32:54,323
Recruit the beasts that share our God.

1009
01:32:56,117 --> 01:32:57,118
Animals?

1010
01:32:58,202 --> 01:32:59,537
From the North.

1011
01:32:59,704 --> 01:33:03,457
You mean, Celts.
They drink the blood of the dead.

1012
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:05,834
Yoke their strength.

1013
01:33:09,296 --> 01:33:11,256
Hired thugs.

1014
01:33:15,219 --> 01:33:16,678
Brilliant!

1015
01:33:21,349 --> 01:33:23,643
Put thine own issue on the throne.

1016
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:27,355
A child? How?

1017
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:29,315
Ally with royal blood.

1018
01:33:31,609 --> 01:33:32,652
Who?

1019
01:33:48,042 --> 01:33:51,295
It's a personal matter, my lord.
But of vital importance.

1020
01:33:51,545 --> 01:33:53,505
I understand, milady.

1021
01:33:54,715 --> 01:33:57,050
This is my most trusted emissary.

1022
01:33:57,217 --> 01:34:01,555
He must travel to France immediately
and give this personally to the King.

1023
01:34:02,055 --> 01:34:04,307
My lady-in-waiting will accompany you.

1024
01:34:04,432 --> 01:34:08,228
My dear, I could not vouch for her safety.

1025
01:34:08,728 --> 01:34:10,689
The journey is full of danger.

1026
01:34:11,064 --> 01:34:15,693
I appreciate your concern, but Sarah's
a skilled rider and I insist she go.

1027
01:34:16,945 --> 01:34:18,696
As you wish.

1028
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:34,044
What's wrong?

1029
01:34:34,295 --> 01:34:36,755
My horse is favoring his foreleg.

1030
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:27,596
What's this?

1031
01:35:30,724 --> 01:35:31,975
An appetizer.

1032
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:34,352
You promised us wagons of gold.

1033
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:40,024
There are greater things than gold...

1034
01:35:40,316 --> 01:35:43,528
more land and power
than you have ever dreamed of!

1035
01:35:46,197 --> 01:35:47,782
When I rule this land...

1036
01:35:48,282 --> 01:35:51,535
it'll be divided between
just the seven of us in this room.

1037
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:53,287
You get Cornwall.

1038
01:35:53,704 --> 01:35:56,707
You can have Wales,
and Scotland is all yours.

1039
01:35:58,209 --> 01:36:00,169
You recruit us to treason...

1040
01:36:00,586 --> 01:36:03,547
and yet you cannot even get gold
through your own forest.

1041
01:36:03,922 --> 01:36:06,175
My lords,
why risk life and limb for a man...

1042
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,553
who can't even snare the paltry bandit
who marked his pretty face?

1043
01:36:10,512 --> 01:36:11,513
Indeed!

1044
01:36:12,681 --> 01:36:14,015
Good point, my lord.

1045
01:36:15,225 --> 01:36:16,851
How can I control England...

1046
01:36:17,185 --> 01:36:19,312
when I cannot even control
my own county?

1047
01:36:21,523 --> 01:36:23,358
I bring in a little help.

1048
01:36:31,949 --> 01:36:33,075
By God.

1049
01:36:34,243 --> 01:36:35,995
You'd ally us with the Celts?

1050
01:36:37,079 --> 01:36:39,582
What can these mercenaries do
that we cannot?

1051
01:37:10,611 --> 01:37:11,612
Very impressive.

1052
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:14,782
All right, milord Sheriff...

1053
01:37:15,616 --> 01:37:18,577
but you must wed royal kin before we act.

1054
01:37:20,162 --> 01:37:22,414
Then your claim to the throne will be...

1055
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:25,876
Iegitimate.

1056
01:37:26,794 --> 01:37:28,170
I'm as good as engaged.

1057
01:37:50,692 --> 01:37:52,485
Duncan, is that you?

1058
01:37:56,989 --> 01:37:58,115
Hello?

1059
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:04,163
Rebecca?

1060
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,670
Nicodemus! Go!

1061
01:38:12,337 --> 01:38:13,964
Find mice.

1062
01:38:17,718 --> 01:38:20,137
I've never seen a noblewoman's breasts.

1063
01:38:32,524 --> 01:38:34,525
We couldn't hold them, milady!

1064
01:38:34,859 --> 01:38:36,819
Someone wants a word with you.

1065
01:39:02,052 --> 01:39:03,345
Easy!

1066
01:39:07,933 --> 01:39:10,894
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.

1067
01:39:58,189 --> 01:39:59,983
It's the warning arrow!

1068
01:40:02,026 --> 01:40:04,320
All is well! It's Duncan!

1069
01:40:14,622 --> 01:40:15,831
What happened?

1070
01:40:16,207 --> 01:40:18,500
I found you. Thank God, I did it.

1071
01:40:19,043 --> 01:40:21,837
-Nottingham's men attacked us.
-Marian?

1072
01:40:22,796 --> 01:40:24,256
They took her.

1073
01:40:33,515 --> 01:40:34,641
What is it?

1074
01:40:36,726 --> 01:40:38,353
Over there! Look!

1075
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:40,396
On the hill!

1076
01:41:03,752 --> 01:41:05,546
Allah, be merciful.

1077
01:41:06,088 --> 01:41:07,381
To the trees!

1078
01:41:07,839 --> 01:41:09,800
To the trees!

1079
01:41:11,009 --> 01:41:12,803
They're coming!

1080
01:41:13,178 --> 01:41:15,472
The old fool led them straight to us.

1081
01:41:20,769 --> 01:41:22,479
Get me prisoners.

1082
01:41:35,366 --> 01:41:36,575
Children!

1083
01:41:36,701 --> 01:41:37,785
Come to me!

1084
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:55,042
My God!

1085
01:44:08,763 --> 01:44:09,764
Save us.

1086
01:44:26,864 --> 01:44:28,491
Save yourselves!

1087
01:44:32,453 --> 01:44:34,997
We better go, Robin! Now!

1088
01:44:51,388 --> 01:44:53,598
This way, my lambs. Come on!

1089
01:44:57,977 --> 01:44:59,229
Hold your fire!

1090
01:45:03,566 --> 01:45:05,777
Gold! Gold! It's gold!

1091
01:45:10,573 --> 01:45:11,866
Fanny!

1092
01:45:19,665 --> 01:45:20,666
Come on!

1093
01:45:49,485 --> 01:45:51,070
Save yourself, John!

1094
01:45:51,362 --> 01:45:53,823
No, Fanny, I won't leave you!

1095
01:45:54,782 --> 01:45:57,868
-Go on, John.
-Never!

1096
01:46:12,716 --> 01:46:14,551
-Hold the rope.
-I've got it.

1097
01:46:17,554 --> 01:46:19,097
John, catch her!

1098
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:30,441
I got you, girl!

1099
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:39,116
Quick!

1100
01:46:48,834 --> 01:46:49,835
Come on!

1101
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:55,841
Go on!

1102
01:46:58,343 --> 01:46:59,553
Don't wait for me!

1103
01:47:00,095 --> 01:47:01,554
John, go on!

1104
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:02,722
Hurry!

1105
01:47:30,874 --> 01:47:32,334
Corpus Christi.

1106
01:47:32,918 --> 01:47:34,002
Amen.

1107
01:47:52,228 --> 01:47:53,646
My Lady Marian.

1108
01:47:55,732 --> 01:47:58,151
By what right do you keep me prisoner?

1109
01:47:59,068 --> 01:48:01,571
You misunderstand my intentions.

1110
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:04,699
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1111
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:08,327
Protection from whom?

1112
01:48:08,577 --> 01:48:10,162
From yourself.

1113
01:48:11,246 --> 01:48:14,541
It seems you've been consorting
with outlaws.

1114
01:48:17,211 --> 01:48:19,546
Where do you hear such lies?

1115
01:48:20,714 --> 01:48:22,883
By your own hand, milady.

1116
01:48:28,596 --> 01:48:30,515
I'm sorry, my child.

1117
01:48:31,933 --> 01:48:34,352
I feared you were being led astray.

1118
01:48:37,605 --> 01:48:38,606
Come.

1119
01:48:47,907 --> 01:48:48,991
It's over.

1120
01:48:50,743 --> 01:48:54,038
Today I return justice to this land.

1121
01:48:55,789 --> 01:48:58,542
I shall hang the ringleaders,
of course, but...

1122
01:48:58,959 --> 01:49:03,755
I'll be generous and give you the lives
of the woodsmen and their families.

1123
01:49:05,132 --> 01:49:06,550
The children.

1124
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,344
And, of course...

1125
01:49:09,636 --> 01:49:12,305
your traitorous lady-in-waiting.

1126
01:49:15,266 --> 01:49:17,227
As a wedding gift.

1127
01:49:22,315 --> 01:49:25,276
And just whom am I supposed to marry?

1128
01:49:31,449 --> 01:49:33,909
Search your heart, my child.

1129
01:49:34,827 --> 01:49:37,913
Why not a union
with the House of Nottingham...

1130
01:49:38,288 --> 01:49:40,582
and heal the wounds in our land?

1131
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:43,919
Only one man can heal the wounds
of this land.

1132
01:49:44,294 --> 01:49:45,420
Robin Hood.

1133
01:49:58,975 --> 01:50:00,685
I'm truly sorry, milady.

1134
01:50:00,852 --> 01:50:02,228
He wasted his life.

1135
01:50:02,353 --> 01:50:04,480
How many lives would you waste?

1136
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:17,493
What a beautiful child.

1137
01:50:21,705 --> 01:50:23,332
So young.

1138
01:50:24,166 --> 01:50:28,795
So alive, so unaware
of how precarious life can be.

1139
01:50:36,511 --> 01:50:39,931
I had a very sad childhood.
I'll tell you about it sometime.

1140
01:50:40,056 --> 01:50:43,643
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1141
01:50:53,569 --> 01:50:57,198
Our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies.

1142
01:50:58,407 --> 01:50:59,867
You understand...

1143
01:51:00,409 --> 01:51:04,330
I cannot allow them to grow up
as my enemies.

1144
01:51:07,374 --> 01:51:09,042
I have no choice.

1145
01:51:11,086 --> 01:51:12,379
That's true.

1146
01:51:52,543 --> 01:51:53,543
Look!

1147
01:51:59,633 --> 01:52:00,759
Christian!

1148
01:52:35,751 --> 01:52:37,461
Sorry to keep you hanging about.

1149
01:52:42,716 --> 01:52:46,136
Would you prefer pain or death?

1150
01:52:48,304 --> 01:52:49,305
Death.

1151
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:51,141
Torture him.

1152
01:52:53,059 --> 01:52:54,269
What about you?

1153
01:52:54,727 --> 01:52:56,187
Pain or death?

1154
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:58,231
Pain!

1155
01:52:58,981 --> 01:52:59,982
Torture him.

1156
01:53:00,483 --> 01:53:01,526
You see...

1157
01:53:01,651 --> 01:53:03,027
it makes no difference.

1158
01:53:03,152 --> 01:53:04,153
Spare me!

1159
01:53:06,322 --> 01:53:09,492
Will you keep the noise down, please?

1160
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:15,289
I have heard that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1161
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,835
Either tell me where he may be hiding...

1162
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:24,714
or we'll hang you, catch him anyway,
and do the same to him.

1163
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,801
-I'd love to kill him for you.
-Will, no!

1164
01:53:31,721 --> 01:53:33,681
So he is alive, then.

1165
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:36,267
I'm not really sure.

1166
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,062
Then why would I need you?

1167
01:53:40,563 --> 01:53:44,525
Because, my lord, if he is alive
I can get close to him.

1168
01:53:44,775 --> 01:53:46,861
I'm one of his men. He'd never suspect me.

1169
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:49,280
-He knows you hate him!
-Shut up!

1170
01:53:51,073 --> 01:53:54,660
He's a trusting fool.
And if he doesn't believe me, he'll kill me...

1171
01:53:54,785 --> 01:53:56,662
then you've lost nothing.

1172
01:53:59,081 --> 01:54:00,707
If you fail...

1173
01:54:02,417 --> 01:54:06,088
I will personally remove your lying tongue.

1174
01:54:08,882 --> 01:54:10,300
And if I succeed...

1175
01:54:11,635 --> 01:54:14,804
I want my freedom
and the bounty on his head.

1176
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:16,973
The lash, Alec!

1177
01:54:17,891 --> 01:54:20,727
Sorry about that.
It'll make it more convincing.

1178
01:54:54,634 --> 01:54:56,636
-My pride brought us to this.
-No.

1179
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,140
It was you who gave pride to these people.

1180
01:55:03,851 --> 01:55:05,144
I was a fool.

1181
01:55:07,021 --> 01:55:08,773
A fool to let him leave.

1182
01:55:10,358 --> 01:55:12,818
To believe I planned it so perfectly.

1183
01:55:16,655 --> 01:55:18,199
A wise man once said:

1184
01:55:20,367 --> 01:55:22,870
"There are no perfect men in this world...

1185
01:55:24,538 --> 01:55:26,331
"only perfect intentions."

1186
01:55:31,878 --> 01:55:34,673
You were an honor
to your countrymen today.

1187
01:55:37,342 --> 01:55:40,136
You fought better
than twenty English knights.

1188
01:56:12,209 --> 01:56:14,878
-I thought you were taken.
-I was.

1189
01:56:15,587 --> 01:56:16,963
How'd you escape?

1190
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:18,798
Traitor!

1191
01:56:19,132 --> 01:56:21,426
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1192
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,053
Get in there!

1193
01:56:23,428 --> 01:56:26,681
Nobody escapes the Sheriff
unless he's lining his pockets.

1194
01:56:29,601 --> 01:56:31,060
Where's my son?

1195
01:56:32,478 --> 01:56:34,605
I'll have your guts for garters, you toad!

1196
01:56:39,652 --> 01:56:40,736
Bugger me!

1197
01:56:42,279 --> 01:56:43,489
Let him speak.

1198
01:56:46,575 --> 01:56:48,202
I bring a message...

1199
01:56:49,912 --> 01:56:51,371
from Nottingham.

1200
01:56:52,456 --> 01:56:55,334
Our men are to be hung in the square
at high noon tomorrow.

1201
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:56,626
And my boy?

1202
01:56:57,794 --> 01:56:58,962
The boy, too.

1203
01:56:59,087 --> 01:57:00,338
Ten men in all.

1204
01:57:01,923 --> 01:57:04,509
The hangings are part of the celebration...

1205
01:57:04,634 --> 01:57:06,594
for the Sheriff's marriage.

1206
01:57:07,762 --> 01:57:08,805
To whom?

1207
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,808
Lady Marian.

1208
01:57:12,767 --> 01:57:14,394
A bride of royal blood.

1209
01:57:17,271 --> 01:57:19,190
And with King Richard gone...

1210
01:57:19,315 --> 01:57:21,233
he'll be after the throne.

1211
01:57:22,276 --> 01:57:25,738
You were to use this news to get near me,
then kill me, right?

1212
01:57:28,991 --> 01:57:30,701
What are your intentions?

1213
01:57:30,993 --> 01:57:33,120
It depends on you, Locksley.

1214
01:57:34,455 --> 01:57:36,957
I've never trusted you, that's no secret.

1215
01:57:37,833 --> 01:57:40,085
Will you finish what you started?

1216
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:44,798
Or will he run like the spoiled rich boy
I always took him for?

1217
01:57:47,175 --> 01:57:50,303
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlett?

1218
01:57:52,013 --> 01:57:54,599
Where does this hatred for me come from?

1219
01:58:07,153 --> 01:58:08,696
From knowing that...

1220
01:58:09,029 --> 01:58:10,948
our father loved you best.

1221
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:15,869
Our father.

1222
01:58:16,328 --> 01:58:17,996
We are brothers.

1223
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:23,293
I'm the son of the woman who replaced
your dead mother for a time!

1224
01:58:23,877 --> 01:58:26,213
-Your anger drove them apart!
-It's a lie!

1225
01:58:26,338 --> 01:58:29,341
It's not a lie! You ruined my life!

1226
01:58:42,061 --> 01:58:45,523
I have more reason to hate you
than anyone.

1227
01:58:46,232 --> 01:58:48,651
But I dared to believe in you.

1228
01:58:50,403 --> 01:58:52,279
What I must know, Brother...

1229
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:56,200
is will you stay with us
and finish what you started?

1230
01:59:01,413 --> 01:59:02,998
I have a brother?

1231
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:08,670
I have a brother!

1232
01:59:12,882 --> 01:59:15,010
I will make my stand with you.

1233
01:59:15,427 --> 01:59:16,886
Side by side.

1234
01:59:17,887 --> 01:59:19,055
To the end.

1235
01:59:21,891 --> 01:59:23,184
To the end!

1236
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:27,063
We're all in.

1237
01:59:28,105 --> 01:59:29,565
Daft buggers.

1238
01:59:34,236 --> 01:59:35,404
We finish this.

1239
02:00:03,514 --> 02:00:06,684
Overwhelmed with happiness.
Thank you for asking.

1240
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:09,520
Yes, all is well.

1241
02:00:09,645 --> 02:00:12,106
All my money back,
Robin Hood is probably dead...

1242
02:00:12,231 --> 02:00:15,026
and I'm going to be king, all as predicted.

1243
02:00:20,364 --> 02:00:22,783
I want you to tell the hangman...

1244
02:00:22,908 --> 02:00:25,577
I don't want to see any broken necks
in the morning.

1245
02:00:25,702 --> 02:00:29,164
I want to see some dancing.

1246
02:00:31,541 --> 02:00:33,543
Don't touch that!

1247
02:00:35,128 --> 02:00:37,047
I can do that myself.

1248
02:00:39,007 --> 02:00:41,885
Thank you very much!

1249
02:01:25,802 --> 02:01:28,471
Have you been spying on me,
you little insect?

1250
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:34,310
Well, who else would have made a....

1251
02:01:53,871 --> 02:01:55,372
Where are you?

1252
02:02:01,419 --> 02:02:02,712
You come early.

1253
02:02:03,213 --> 02:02:04,965
The signs have not aligned yet.

1254
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:07,550
You can stop all that, you old fake!

1255
02:02:08,635 --> 02:02:10,178
I will try for thee anyway.

1256
02:02:16,476 --> 02:02:17,477
The union...

1257
02:02:17,852 --> 02:02:21,772
the blood of the lion,
new power, new soul--

1258
02:02:22,189 --> 02:02:25,026
I found the hole!

1259
02:02:25,735 --> 02:02:28,445
You dare to spy on me?

1260
02:02:28,821 --> 02:02:30,614
I want the truth!

1261
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:33,951
Why?

1262
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:36,829
The truth has never served you before.

1263
02:02:38,038 --> 02:02:40,957
Truth didn't put Nottingham
where he is today...

1264
02:02:42,334 --> 02:02:44,127
Mortianna did.

1265
02:02:44,461 --> 02:02:46,504
You freakish hag! I despise you!

1266
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:48,882
After the wedding,
you're out on the streets.

1267
02:02:49,007 --> 02:02:52,719
Without my protection, the people
will rip out your black heart and burn it!

1268
02:02:52,844 --> 02:02:55,680
Without me, you're nothing...

1269
02:02:57,015 --> 02:03:00,393
destroyed, a flea bite, a speck.

1270
02:03:03,187 --> 02:03:04,897
I birthed you from this body.

1271
02:03:06,148 --> 02:03:08,901
I stole a babe in this very castle
and killed it...

1272
02:03:09,026 --> 02:03:10,152
so that you...

1273
02:03:10,528 --> 02:03:12,238
might rise in its place.

1274
02:03:14,907 --> 02:03:15,908
You're my son.

1275
02:03:20,329 --> 02:03:21,330
You despise me?

1276
02:03:23,707 --> 02:03:25,834
You are me.

1277
02:03:27,002 --> 02:03:29,337
You know from your empty soul,
it is the truth.

1278
02:03:31,214 --> 02:03:32,382
All my life...

1279
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:34,801
I've been a freak.

1280
02:03:36,427 --> 02:03:39,722
When you stud the Lady Marian...

1281
02:03:40,348 --> 02:03:42,308
and my grandchild takes the throne...

1282
02:03:42,809 --> 02:03:43,810
my blood...

1283
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:46,479
this twisted seed...

1284
02:03:46,771 --> 02:03:48,481
will rule through him.

1285
02:03:49,482 --> 02:03:52,443
We'll see who's freakish then.

1286
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:30,229
What was that?

1287
02:04:30,938 --> 02:04:32,898
Truly, you are a wizard!

1288
02:04:33,149 --> 02:04:35,609
The mystery is in the black powder.

1289
02:04:35,985 --> 02:04:38,696
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.

1290
02:04:41,699 --> 02:04:44,409
You'll be by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1291
02:04:44,535 --> 02:04:47,579
John, you sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1292
02:04:47,871 --> 02:04:50,540
I will hide below the scaffold...

1293
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:53,251
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1294
02:04:54,127 --> 02:04:56,504
No. I'll do that.
You cover us with your bow.

1295
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:58,173
It's too dangerous.

1296
02:04:58,631 --> 02:05:00,091
So is your aim.

1297
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:06,014
Whatever Azeem is concocting,
we must each be in place for it.

1298
02:05:06,139 --> 02:05:09,183
Now, our success
depends on total concert.

1299
02:05:09,475 --> 02:05:11,769
-We may be only six men--
-Seven.

1300
02:05:12,395 --> 02:05:16,190
-What? Where's the little ones?
-Safe with my mother.

1301
02:05:16,482 --> 02:05:18,609
You cracked? You'd get hurt.

1302
02:05:18,734 --> 02:05:21,904
I've had eight babies.
Don't tell me about getting hurt.

1303
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:25,199
Anyway, I won't just sit
and let one of them die!

1304
02:05:25,491 --> 02:05:28,285
You should be bloody well minding
the other seven.

1305
02:05:28,994 --> 02:05:30,287
Tell her, Rob.

1306
02:05:36,918 --> 02:05:38,795
You will take position here.

1307
02:05:52,433 --> 02:05:55,978
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1308
02:05:56,437 --> 02:06:00,149
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1309
02:06:05,446 --> 02:06:07,072
What have you got there?

1310
02:06:07,448 --> 02:06:11,577
The Lord's finest brew
for the good Sheriff's fighting men.

1311
02:06:11,869 --> 02:06:13,996
It has a mighty kick.

1312
02:07:15,054 --> 02:07:16,055
Hey, you!

1313
02:07:17,849 --> 02:07:20,893
-Do I know you?
-Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1314
02:07:21,185 --> 02:07:22,812
Oh, my God, you stink.

1315
02:07:23,062 --> 02:07:26,649
-Pardon my blindness. I'm always falling--
-Get out of here.

1316
02:07:30,486 --> 02:07:31,862
Careful, Friar.

1317
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:36,116
What are you doing?

1318
02:07:36,408 --> 02:07:40,704
Distributing libations for the celebration
of the Sheriff's nuptials.

1319
02:07:40,996 --> 02:07:42,456
Is something amiss?

1320
02:07:42,581 --> 02:07:44,624
You are. Get this out of here!

1321
02:07:44,916 --> 02:07:48,878
Caesar has spoken, my leprous friend.
Let's collect our offerings and depart.

1322
02:07:49,004 --> 02:07:50,463
Is this your finger?

1323
02:07:50,755 --> 02:07:53,299
Leper? Get out of here!

1324
02:07:53,591 --> 02:07:56,803
Leaving bits of himself all over England.

1325
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:07,229
What are you doing?

1326
02:08:07,438 --> 02:08:10,483
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging.

1327
02:08:10,691 --> 02:08:13,402
-What's in this bundle?
-That's firewood.

1328
02:08:18,699 --> 02:08:20,033
Hello, my lover.

1329
02:08:27,124 --> 02:08:29,918
Make way for the Lord's work!
No fighting here.

1330
02:08:30,377 --> 02:08:32,337
Make way for the Lord's work!

1331
02:08:32,545 --> 02:08:35,840
A benediction for these poor bastards
who are about to stretch.

1332
02:08:36,299 --> 02:08:38,426
God, receive them in thy mercy...

1333
02:08:38,718 --> 02:08:41,846
and show them the love
they so richly deserve.

1334
02:08:44,974 --> 02:08:47,768
Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.

1335
02:09:07,913 --> 02:09:10,707
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1336
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:14,377
No more than your wedding present.

1337
02:09:18,590 --> 02:09:19,841
Bring them out!

1338
02:09:59,337 --> 02:10:00,338
Lynch him!

1339
02:10:41,878 --> 02:10:42,879
Make way!

1340
02:10:55,933 --> 02:10:56,934
Traitor!

1341
02:11:07,695 --> 02:11:09,029
What's going on?

1342
02:11:11,281 --> 02:11:12,533
Bring him here!

1343
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:27,005
Oh, the turncoat!

1344
02:11:27,964 --> 02:11:29,507
Did you succeed?

1345
02:11:31,301 --> 02:11:33,511
I found his lair, but...

1346
02:11:34,929 --> 02:11:36,180
he was dead.

1347
02:11:37,223 --> 02:11:39,350
You sure? You saw Hood's body?

1348
02:11:41,352 --> 02:11:42,353
No.

1349
02:11:43,187 --> 02:11:44,480
I saw a grave.

1350
02:11:46,065 --> 02:11:47,399
We found this on him.

1351
02:11:52,154 --> 02:11:53,363
String him up.

1352
02:11:58,619 --> 02:11:59,828
Put me down!

1353
02:12:04,666 --> 02:12:05,667
Let me go!

1354
02:12:10,839 --> 02:12:13,216
-Leave him! He's only a boy.
-Shut up!

1355
02:12:14,551 --> 02:12:15,551
Bastard!

1356
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:18,221
You all right?

1357
02:12:18,554 --> 02:12:19,555
Now?

1358
02:12:35,696 --> 02:12:36,697
My lord...

1359
02:12:36,947 --> 02:12:38,949
it appears there's no more room!

1360
02:12:39,074 --> 02:12:41,535
I'll have to respectfully decline!

1361
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:42,953
Come on, you. Down.

1362
02:12:49,125 --> 02:12:50,543
Hold your tongue!

1363
02:12:52,879 --> 02:12:55,548
There's always room for one more.

1364
02:13:29,748 --> 02:13:31,208
That's my boy!

1365
02:13:34,461 --> 02:13:35,545
My boy!

1366
02:14:07,701 --> 02:14:08,702
Locksley!

1367
02:14:08,827 --> 02:14:09,828
Robin!

1368
02:14:42,318 --> 02:14:44,987
Get some troops in here!

1369
02:14:54,496 --> 02:14:56,248
What are you waiting for?

1370
02:15:47,714 --> 02:15:48,882
Father!

1371
02:15:53,386 --> 02:15:55,596
Come on, you milksops!

1372
02:15:56,305 --> 02:15:58,391
-Fight your way free.
-Look out!

1373
02:16:05,648 --> 02:16:07,316
This way! To the wall!

1374
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:08,859
Lord Sheriff...

1375
02:16:08,984 --> 02:16:11,445
is this your idea of control?

1376
02:16:13,155 --> 02:16:15,282
Shut up, you twit!

1377
02:16:15,532 --> 02:16:16,533
Come with me!

1378
02:16:24,916 --> 02:16:26,376
English!

1379
02:16:26,876 --> 02:16:28,461
English!

1380
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:32,215
Behold Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir!

1381
02:16:33,174 --> 02:16:35,134
I am not one of you...

1382
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:37,136
but I fight!

1383
02:16:37,428 --> 02:16:39,722
I fight with Robin Hood...

1384
02:16:40,181 --> 02:16:41,599
against a tyrant...

1385
02:16:41,849 --> 02:16:43,893
who holds you under his boot!

1386
02:16:44,268 --> 02:16:46,562
If you would be free men...

1387
02:16:46,937 --> 02:16:50,065
then you must fight! Join us now!

1388
02:16:52,109 --> 02:16:53,444
Join Robin Hood!

1389
02:16:53,569 --> 02:16:54,570
Freedom!

1390
02:17:32,731 --> 02:17:34,358
Close the gate!

1391
02:17:35,317 --> 02:17:37,444
Guard it with your life!

1392
02:17:37,736 --> 02:17:40,280
Bring the Bishop to my chapel!

1393
02:17:42,074 --> 02:17:43,283
Right there!

1394
02:17:51,082 --> 02:17:52,542
Is she worth it?

1395
02:17:53,251 --> 02:17:54,711
Worth dying for?

1396
02:18:10,851 --> 02:18:12,645
He cleared it!

1397
02:18:46,344 --> 02:18:47,553
We're doomed.

1398
02:18:53,225 --> 02:18:55,478
'Tis rebellion! We must escape!

1399
02:18:55,603 --> 02:18:57,396
-Marry us!
-No!

1400
02:18:57,897 --> 02:19:00,107
I will never marry you!

1401
02:19:02,735 --> 02:19:05,195
That's my wife, crone!

1402
02:19:06,530 --> 02:19:07,531
Get away!

1403
02:19:08,407 --> 02:19:09,616
She's ripe.

1404
02:19:09,908 --> 02:19:12,619
She'll give us a son. Take her now.

1405
02:19:13,411 --> 02:19:18,416
I will not take her
until we are properly wed!

1406
02:19:18,667 --> 02:19:22,587
For once, I will have something pure!

1407
02:19:24,088 --> 02:19:26,132
'Tis madness to delay.

1408
02:19:28,259 --> 02:19:29,302
Marry them...

1409
02:19:29,427 --> 02:19:30,803
or face me!

1410
02:19:52,699 --> 02:19:53,992
Where is she?

1411
02:19:58,788 --> 02:19:59,998
Lady Marian?

1412
02:20:00,123 --> 02:20:02,417
Up the stairs, that way!

1413
02:20:12,135 --> 02:20:13,594
Get on with it!

1414
02:20:19,058 --> 02:20:20,101
Statue!

1415
02:20:22,311 --> 02:20:25,606
"Do you, George, Sheriff of Nottingham...

1416
02:20:26,065 --> 02:20:28,192
"take this woman to be your wife?

1417
02:20:36,575 --> 02:20:38,034
"To have and to hold...

1418
02:20:39,161 --> 02:20:42,455
"in sickness and in health,
for better or for worse...."

1419
02:20:42,831 --> 02:20:44,582
Yes, yes! Come on!

1420
02:20:44,833 --> 02:20:46,042
Make haste!

1421
02:20:46,167 --> 02:20:50,129
"Do you, Marian, take this man
to be your husband?"

1422
02:20:51,339 --> 02:20:53,007
Yes, of course she does.

1423
02:21:00,681 --> 02:21:02,308
Damned English oak!

1424
02:21:04,518 --> 02:21:06,270
Let's try the other way.

1425
02:21:18,448 --> 02:21:19,825
What do you want?

1426
02:21:24,538 --> 02:21:27,499
I can't do this with all that racket!

1427
02:21:31,127 --> 02:21:32,378
How could you?

1428
02:21:50,312 --> 02:21:51,855
The painted man!

1429
02:21:52,147 --> 02:21:53,190
The witch!

1430
02:21:53,315 --> 02:21:57,569
I didn't know. I didn't know it was you.
Please, sire, have pity.

1431
02:21:57,694 --> 02:21:59,363
Don't harm an old woman.

1432
02:22:18,589 --> 02:22:23,344
You may take this body,
but it will not be me!

1433
02:22:24,262 --> 02:22:25,346
Not again!

1434
02:22:27,515 --> 02:22:30,810
"l pronounce you man and wife,
in the name of the Father...

1435
02:22:31,268 --> 02:22:32,561
"the Son...

1436
02:22:32,853 --> 02:22:34,438
"and the Holy Ghost."

1437
02:22:48,034 --> 02:22:49,995
Do you mind, Locksley?

1438
02:22:51,037 --> 02:22:52,831
We've just been married.

1439
02:23:05,718 --> 02:23:07,178
Recognize this?

1440
02:23:09,555 --> 02:23:12,016
It belonged to your father.

1441
02:23:13,058 --> 02:23:14,768
Appropriate, don't you think...

1442
02:23:14,894 --> 02:23:17,396
that I use it to send you to meet him?

1443
02:23:19,315 --> 02:23:21,692
I shall never fear my father's sword.

1444
02:23:23,235 --> 02:23:24,236
Really?

1445
02:23:27,739 --> 02:23:29,616
Now we're even.

1446
02:23:59,311 --> 02:24:01,897
If I must, I'll take you a piece at a time.

1447
02:24:06,109 --> 02:24:07,945
I'll do the only taking today.

1448
02:24:19,998 --> 02:24:23,251
You sold your soul to Satan, Your Grace.

1449
02:24:24,752 --> 02:24:28,756
You accused innocent men of witchcraft
and let them die.

1450
02:24:29,966 --> 02:24:34,929
Brother Friar, you would not strike
a fellow man of the cloth.

1451
02:24:36,806 --> 02:24:38,099
No, I wouldn't.

1452
02:24:39,809 --> 02:24:42,102
I'll help you pack for your journey.

1453
02:24:42,353 --> 02:24:45,189
You'll need lots of gold to help you
on your way.

1454
02:24:45,689 --> 02:24:47,357
You're a very rich man.

1455
02:24:47,524 --> 02:24:48,567
This, too.

1456
02:24:49,485 --> 02:24:50,569
And there!

1457
02:24:51,486 --> 02:24:53,739
Here's thirty pieces of silver...

1458
02:24:54,197 --> 02:24:57,159
to pay the devil on your way to hell!

1459
02:26:05,558 --> 02:26:07,226
Get ready.

1460
02:27:37,980 --> 02:27:40,274
I have fulfilled my vow, Sadiq.

1461
02:27:58,374 --> 02:28:00,001
You came for me.

1462
02:28:01,502 --> 02:28:03,004
You're alive.

1463
02:28:03,838 --> 02:28:05,631
I would die for you.

1464
02:28:14,348 --> 02:28:18,978
"By the power vested in me
by God's holy church, I say, any man...

1465
02:28:19,228 --> 02:28:22,189
"with reason why these two
shouldn't be joined...

1466
02:28:23,023 --> 02:28:24,691
"let him speak now...

1467
02:28:25,234 --> 02:28:27,486
"or forever hold his peace.

1468
02:28:31,698 --> 02:28:33,617
-"l now pronounce you--"
-Hold!

1469
02:28:34,034 --> 02:28:35,035
I speak!

1470
02:28:45,586 --> 02:28:46,838
Richard!

1471
02:28:57,723 --> 02:29:00,184
I will not allow this wedding to proceed.

1472
02:29:00,559 --> 02:29:01,685
Unless...

1473
02:29:03,062 --> 02:29:05,397
I'm allowed to give the bride away.

1474
02:29:05,564 --> 02:29:07,274
You look radiant, Cousin.

1475
02:29:10,736 --> 02:29:12,946
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.

1476
02:29:13,071 --> 02:29:16,074
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.

1477
02:29:16,616 --> 02:29:18,910
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.

1478
02:29:20,161 --> 02:29:21,162
Proceed!

1479
02:29:29,128 --> 02:29:31,172
"Husband and wife."

1480
02:29:32,965 --> 02:29:34,634
You may kiss the bride.

1481
02:29:34,926 --> 02:29:36,218
I know that.

1482
02:30:02,327 --> 02:30:03,912
Get out of it.

1483
02:30:04,162 --> 02:30:06,831
We waste good celebration time.
