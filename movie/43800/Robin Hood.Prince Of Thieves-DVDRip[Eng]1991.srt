In my country,
we talk to our women.

Where I come from,
Christian...

00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,120
there are women
of such beauty...

177
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,840
that they can possess
a man's mind so...

178
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,840
that he would be willing
to die for them.

179
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,080
Wait. Is that why
you were to be executed?

180
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,200
Because of a woman?

181
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,280
That's it, isn't it?

182
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,480
That's it!

You painted old dog.
Who was she?

185
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,800
The mullah's daughter?

186
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,800
Huh?

187
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,450
Another man's wife?

188
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,770
What's her name?

189
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,650
Is there no sun

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,170
- Her name.
- East!

Her name.

193
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,330
- Jasmina.
- That way.

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,330
You are sure?

I'm five miles from home.

196
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,770
Was she worth it?

197
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,690

what manner of creature...

takes six men to attack it.

A small boy...
a truly dangerous animal.

222
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,070
This boy killed one of
the sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

223
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,550
You starve us!

224
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,390
We needed the meat.

225
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,350
I advise you
to move on, pilgrim.

226
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,790
This is the sheriff s land.

This is my land and my tree.

Therefore, whatever is in it
also belongs to me.

the pleasure of your name...

Guy of Gisborne,
the sheriff s cousin.

247
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,240
That little bastard
was poaching deer.

248
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,280
Poaching? Is it not
a greater crime to starve a family?

249
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,800
Go on, Locksley.

Go on.

I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

Now get off my land.

And tell Nottingham
what happens to his scum...

pick on small children.

to save my life...

then leave me

include prayer times...

Aah!

680
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,900
Too much mead, old friend?

681
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,820
Oh, forgive me.
I oversleep.

682
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,460
No, no.
Rest yourself.

683
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,780
What day is it, Duncan?

684
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,220
Sunday, I think.

685
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,540
Do they still give alms
to the poor at mass?

686
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,980
That they do.

687
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,900
These days,
the need for mercy...

688
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,340
is greater than ever.

689
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,120
We beseech thy blessing,
Lord...

690
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,680
on all your people...

691
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,040
but most especially...

692
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,640
on our noble sheriff
of Nottingham.

693
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,680
Grant him the wisdom...

694
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,160
to guide and protect
our glorious city.

695
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,560
Grant him also
the strength...

696
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,480
to bring to justice...

697
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,160
the lawless men who would
threaten its safety...

698
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,570
and prosperity...

699
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,570
and the judgment
to punish them...

700
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:05,370
in your name.

701
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,770
Amen.

702
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,890
- Amen.
- Amen.

703
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,410
Go in peace.

704
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,130
Alms, please, sir.

705
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,490
Please, madam.

706
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:21,210
- Sarah.
- Yes.

707
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,170
Thank you.

708
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,130
Thank you.

709
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,090
Ma'am.

710
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,410
That's all I have.

711
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,650
God bless you, mum.

712
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,170
Alms for a blind man, milady?

713
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,610
Mmm.

714
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,170
For one who cannot
see your beauty.

715
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,490
Hello.

716
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,890
What are you doing here?

717
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,650
Searching my soul.

718
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,500
I do not wish to be seen
with an outlaw.

719
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,900
You prefer the company
of Nottingham?

720
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,820
There's a price
on your head.

721
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,780
How much?

722
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,220
100 gold pieces.

723
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,660
Is that all?

724
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,060
I'll have to annoy
the good sheriff more.

725
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,980
Soon it will be 1,000.

726
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,860
For 1,000, I would
turn you in myself.

727
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,780
Nottingham is
mounting an army.

728
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,180
He has every blacksmith
in the county...

729
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,580
in the castle,
making swords and armor.

730
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,020
What is he planning?

731
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,420
I don't know,
but there's no limit...

732
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,540
to the man's ambitions.

733
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,100
Go!

734
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,060
Thank you.

735
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,020
Quickly! Go!

736
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,580
Robin, do something for me.

737
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,540
What?

738
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,700
Take a bath.

739
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,900
Take a bath?

740
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,870
These are my private
chambers, my son.

741
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,870
I have priests
who would hear your confession.

742
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,110
- Gggt!
- Aah!

743
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,510
Shh!

744
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:16,270
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

745
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,950
Welcome home, Robin.

746
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,750
You shine like
the sun, milady.

747
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,630
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

748
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,950
My cousin tells me...

749
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,830
the knave deprived
you of some horses.

750
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,270
Oh... yes.

751
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:33,710
A most disagreeable
experience.

752
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,110
Yes, I know.
And for inflicting that upon you...

753
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,470
I'm going to hang him
from the walls by his own entrails.

754
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,910
I'd like to see that.

755
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,470
If you'd bring
your household...

756
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,790
within the city walls...

757
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,190
I could give your every need
my personal attention.

758
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,590
I do thank you,
but I prefer to stay...

759
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,510
in my family's home
for now.

760
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,880
Oh. Well, then, perhaps
you'd do me the honor...

761
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,800
of accepting
a small token...

762
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,400
of my undying devotion
to your safety.

763
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,600
Oh!

764
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,480
Why... King Richard
will be deeply moved...

765
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,480
to hear of your concern
for my welfare.

766
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,480
Yes, um...

767
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,200
I'm afraid the king
has many enemies...

768
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,120
both abroad
and at home.

769
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,040
I fear for his safe return.

770
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,960
Oh, no. Fear not,
dear sheriff.

771
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,360
He will return,
and when he does...

772
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,080
he will wish to reward
his faithful subjects.

773
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,600
I asked your father
three times...

774
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,360
if he worshiped
the dark one...

775
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,200
because his answer
vexed me so grievously.

776
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,120
He said...

777
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,880
he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

778
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,330
You lie.

779
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:59,850
On your souls...

780
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,210
do not shed blood
in the house of God!

781
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,770
Aah!

782

[Nottingham]

783
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:11,970
In there!

784
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,330
Get him!

785
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,450
Get him!

786
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:21,290
Locksley!

787
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,610
I'm going to cut
your heart out...

788
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,290
with a spoon!

789
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,170
Then it begins.

790
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:32,250
Aah!

791
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,210
Aah!

792
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,330
Aah!

793
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,050
He's taking
the sheriff s horse!

794
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,820
Close the gate!

795
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,260
The sheriff s horse!
Close the gate!

796
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,660
He's stolen
the sheriff s horse!

797
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,500
Uhh!

798
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,820
What are you looking at?

799
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,460
There's a rider coming in!

800
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,620
Water!

801
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,580
Thank you.

802
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,020
For the animal.

803
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,940
How can I protect you,
Christian...

804
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,350
if I know not
where you go?

805
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,270
You've hardly raised
a finger...

806
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:45,870
when you do know...

807
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:46,830
great one.

808
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,870
I prefer to have
the choice.

809
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:52,270
Wonderful. You've stolen
the sheriff s horse?

810
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,150
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

811
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,590
Are you afraid, John?

812
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,030
Yeah, a little.

813
00:52:58,110 --> 00:52:59,470
Well, so is the sheriff.

814
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,030
Today I gave him a sting
he'll not forget.

815
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,430
You fool!
You've started a war!

816
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,870
We're already at war.

817
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,510
Duncan...

818
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,470
bread.

819
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,550
And I say we strike back...

820
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,470
at the very man
who takes our homes...

821
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,750
and would
hunt our children.

822
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:17,710
We?

823
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,270
You planning to
join us then, matey?

824
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,910
No, to lead you.

825
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,230
Christian...

826
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,750
these are simple people.

827
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,150
They are not warriors.

828
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,630
Be careful
you do not do this...

829
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,910
for your own purposes.

830
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,190
You forget yourself, Azeem.

831
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,920
I do not ask for your company
or counsel.

832
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,760
Why a spoon, cousin?

833
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,680
Why not an ax
or something...

834
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,600
Because it's dull, you twit!

835
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,840
It'll hurt more!

836
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,360
I want this brigand found.

837
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,800
Starve them out!

838
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,760
Slaughter their...

839
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,680
No, take their livestock.

840
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,040
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

841
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,920
Well, perhaps we could create
a name for him...

842
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,800
something to drive fear
into the hearts of the populace.

843
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,240
Maybe Locksley the Lethal
or Wreaking Robin or...

844
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,240
Whatever!

845
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,880
I want him dead
by the next full moon...

846
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,280
before the barons
come back.

847
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,400
Now sew...

848
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,880
and keep the stitches small!

849
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,850
He's not here, sir.

850
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:40,010
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

851
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,850
He died last winter.

852
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,850
Burn it down.

853
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,610
Light the other one.

854
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,770
Leave us the sow.
Her young will feed us.

855
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,330
Beware of
the Sherwood bandit.

856
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,130
Robin of the Hood?
Yes, sir.

857
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,330
Pray he's brought to us
before winter.

858
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,330
Ma!

859
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,530
Over here!

860
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:19,570
Oh, John!

861
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,810
Papa!

862
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,970
They burned it, all of it.

863
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,300
Where is this
Robin Hood now?

864
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,100
He's there.

865
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,420
Look! Look what
they've done!

866
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,700
If it's fame
you seek, Christian...

867
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,620
I think you have it.

868
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,820
You brought this misery
on us, Locksley.

869
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,220
It's Nottingham
trying to divide us.

870
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,140
We are divided, rich boy.

871
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,020
I'm not as blind
as that old man.

872
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,900
You're still trying to be
lord of the manor.

873
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,700
I heard today the sheriff
now values your neck...

874
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,380
at 500 gold pieces.

875
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,260
I say we take him in.

876
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,820
- Aye.
- Aye.

877
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,420
Do you think the sheriff
will return everything...

878
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,860
after I'm gone?

879
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,500
He'll give us the reward
and our pardons.

880
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,700
Wrong.

881
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,500
He'll stretch your
necks one by one.

882
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,020
What would you
have us do...

883
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,950
fight armored men
on horseback...

884
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,350
with rocks
and our bare hands?

885
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,790
If needs be.

886
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,350
But with
the one true weapon...

887
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,950
that escapes you, Will...

888
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,750
courage.

889
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,110
Look out!

890
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,870
Thank you, Wulf.

891
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,390
You wish to end this?

892
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,430
You wish to go home?

893
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:07,430
Then we must stop
fighting amongst ourselves...

894
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:11,150
and face that the price
for it may be dear.

895
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,950
I for one
would rather die...

896
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,990
than to spend my life
in hiding.

897
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,070
The sheriff calls us outlaws...

898
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,510
but I say we are free.

899
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,600
And one free man
defending his home...

900
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,480
is more powerful
than 10 hired soldiers.

901
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,840
The Crusades taught me that.

902
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,400
I will make you
no promises save one...

903
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,560
that if you truly believe
in your hearts...

904
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,000
that you are free...

905
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,240
then I say we can win.

906
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,720
They got armor.

907
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,800
Yeah! Right!

908
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,480
They got armor, Bull?

909
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,200
Even this boy
can be taught...

910
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,600
to find chinks
in every suit of armor.

911
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,640
We ain't got nothing to eat.

912
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,560
What do we need that
the forest cannot provide?

913
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,080
We have food,
wood for weapons.

914
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,120
We'll find safety
and solace in her trees.

915
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah, but
what about our kin?

916
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,680
Sheriff s taken
all they got, too.

917
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,920
Then, by God,
we take it back.

918
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,450
Ho!

919
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:48,940
Hyah!

920
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,260
What's the meaning of this?

921
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,660
Milady, a woman
of your beauty...

922
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,340
has no need for
such decorations.

923
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,380
How dare you!

924
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,180
[Bell Rings]

925
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,150
Please don't take that.

926
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,950
Please don't take that.

927
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,990
Please, sir, those
belong to our lord.

928
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,470
Now they belong
to my lord sheriff!

929
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,110
- Yay!
- Ha ha!

930
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,550
Give it back.

931
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,990
Good.
Tell the sheriff...

932
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,590
for every harm he
does these people...

933
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,550
I will visit it
back on him tenfold.

934
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,830
Something vexes thee?

935
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,270
What the devil?

936
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,230
'Tis a hot day,
my friend...

937
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,630
to burden your horse
with a heavy purse.

938
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,480
The sheriff will hear of this.

939
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,800
I truly hope so.

940
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah!

941
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,800
There, luv.

942
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,320
Buy yourself
a new sow.

943
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,880
God bless you, Fanny...

944
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,960
and God bless Robin Hood.

945
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,480
We reckon he's nicked
three to four million...

946
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,280
in the last
five months, sire.

947
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,640
All right, fine.
Raise the bounty on his head.

948
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,320
25,000 crowns.

949
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,800
Begging your pardon, sire.

950
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,160
It won't do no good
how much you raise it.

951
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,080
Really, scribe?
And why is that?

952
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,480
Because, sire,
the poor, you see?

953
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,880
He gives them
what he takes...

954
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,680
and, well, sire,
they love him.

955
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,010
Just a minute.

956
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,290
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket...

957
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:10,690
forcing me
to hurt the public...

958
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:13,130
and they love him for it?

959
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,730
Yes.

960
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,770
That's it, then!

961
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:21,610
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans...

962
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,370
no more
merciful beheadings...

963
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,090
and call off Christmas.

964
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,650
The treasury is empty.

965
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,530
All day and all night,
people plague my door...

966
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,970
whining for tax relief...

967
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,370
and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

968

"We cannot pay thee...

what the highwayman
has taken."

970
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,170
It's the shortest route
to London.

971
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:45,090
It's the only road to London,
you little ferret.

972
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,970
Sir Guy's patrols
have found nothing, sire.

973
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,890
No camp. Nothing.

974
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,090
[Spits]

975

This hooded viper
simply slithers into the forest.

01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,570
You, my room,
10:30 tonight.

You, 10:45...

978
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,130

#What's the pleasure

20.

How many?

991
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,590
Five.

01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,150
You're supposed to help me!

1007
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,550
I'm supposed to be
meeting a girl!

1008
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,870
You men in front, after me.

1009
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:22,390
You men in the rear,
stay with the wagon!

1010
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:25,120
On to glory!

1011
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,120
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1012
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,000
Bastards!
Come on, find them!

1013
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,080
# Oh... ##

1014
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,720
[Burp]

1015
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,000
Go!

1016
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,240
Hyah!

1017
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,480
Hyah!

1018
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,570
Welcome to Sherwood,
Friar. Giddyup!

1019
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,650
Aagh!

1020
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,780
This treasure had a purpose.

1021
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:01,700
We must find out what.

1022
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,620
Oh! Aah!

1023
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,260
Good morning,
my reverend friend.

1024
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,180
You travel
with poor company...

1025
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,060
when you travel with
Nottingham soldiers.

1026
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,660
Tax him!

1027
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:26,740
- Tax him!
- Tax him!

1028
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:28,180
I'm Robin of Locksley...

1029
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,700
and my men are thirsty.

1030
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,420
- Aye!
- That's right.

1031
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,580
Robin Hood!

1032
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:38,300
Ha! Lord bless me.

1033
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,460
I mistook you
for common thieves.

1034
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,380
Kindly let me pass, huh?

1035
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,780
Surely the lord
has the charity...

1036
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:48,140
to spare a few barrels...

1037
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,830
for good Christian men, yes?

1038
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,670
We have much to celebrate.

1039
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:53,230
Come on.

1040
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:57,310
If you wish them to share
in the good lord's brew...

1041
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,270
you must best me for it!

1042
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,510
Hyah!

1043
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,350
Confess, Robin Hood...

1044
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:10,190
that Friar Tuck is a braver,
holier, and wiser man...

1045
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:12,510
than thou art.

1046
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:31,590
He giveth
and he taketh away.

1047
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,430
Do you yield?

1048
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,270
I'd rather roast in hell.

1049
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,680
Aah!

1050
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,600
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1051
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,800
# Robin has his way #

1052
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,040
#Whether you live
by night or day #

1053
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,360
#Whether you're rich
or young or old #

1054
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,320
#Whether you're noble,
meek, or bold #

1055
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,760
#You will fall #

1056
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,840
# Short or tall ##

1057
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:07,760
Oh, I think the good friar's
taken us far enough.

1058
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,040
Well done, Friar.

1059
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,760
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humility.

1060
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,720
Ohh.

1061
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:22,980
Well, Tuck...

1062
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,380
Thanks for the beer.

1063
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,260
Are these not
the meek of the earth?

1064
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:31,140
We're in need of an honest man
to minister to them.

1065
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,660
What say you, Friar?

1066
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,740
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

1067
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,990
I accept.

1068
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:44,070
Good.

1069
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,270
You will not regret it.

1070
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,430
Aye, but you may!

1071
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,550
We were ambushed, cousin.

1072
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,160
Spanish steel.

1073
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,190
Much stronger than
our native blades.

1074
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,710
Ahem. Any losses?

1075
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:34,800
Some.

1076
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,670
In truth, all of them.

1077
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,110
And the gold?

1078
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,070
Taken.

1079
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,430
Robin Hood?

1080
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:50,310
They were woodsmen,
cousin.

1081
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:54,830
Robin Hood.

1082
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,310
I tried.

1083
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,910
I tried.

1084
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:00,990
Cousin.

1085
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,270
I tried. I tried.

1086
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:05,670
Cousin, we must be strong.

1087
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,510
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

1088
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,550
And I can't allow
a lieutenant...

1089
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,030
to fail me.

1090
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,310
Uhh!

1091
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,710
[Groans]

1092
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:30,470
Well, at least
I didn't use a spoon.

1093
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,590
Ha ha.

1094
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,150
It's good steel.

1095
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:44,870
Much!

1096
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:45,870
What?

1097
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,070
Take the left one.

1098
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,910
Which one's left?

1099
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,710
Which one you taking?

1100
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,750
What do you mean?

1101
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,190
If you're taking the left,
I'm taking the right.

1102
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,070
Which one's on the right?

1103
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:00,230
The one next to...

1104
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:04,350
Bollocks, we'll just
jump out and grab them.

1105
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,910
- Now?
- Now!

1106
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,750
[Neigh]

1107
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:10,030
A donation if you please.

1108
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:12,950
Donation?
For what?

1109
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,390
Bull?

1110
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,030
Uh, for passage
through Sherwood.

1111
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,710
Very well.

1112
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:21,550
Come get it.

1113
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:22,790
Huh?

1114
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,030
You stunted shrub.

1115
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,790
How dare you attack us?

1116
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,430
It's me job, milady.

1117
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,470
And who is your employer?

1118
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:36,510
Robin Hood.

1119
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,230
I insist on seeing him at once.

1120
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:43,910
No!

1121
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:45,830
I'm trying to stop her, Bull!

1122
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:47,750
You cannot go down there!

1123
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,030
Will you stop?

1124
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,310
Don't rush.
You'll fall.

1125
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,590
He's not expecting you!

1126
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,990
My lady's intrusion
is simply tit for tat.

1127
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:56,350
Out of the way,
you old traps!

1128
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,310
You can't go down there!

1129
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,430
Oh.

1130
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:01,350
I told you,
not down there!

1131
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:03,950
You've already had
the rough part of my hand.

1132
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:05,510
You'll get it again.

1133
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:06,950
Ooh! Oh, I say!

1134
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,390
Cover your eyes.

1135
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:10,310
Milady, don't.

1136
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,790
You could have said.

1137
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,910
Robin!

1138
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:28,510
You got visitors!

1139
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:35,470
Don't look at me like that.
It weren't my fault.

1140
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:36,710
It was Much!

1141
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:38,150
It weren't me!

1142
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,590
Be careful.
It's slippery there.

1143
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:44,470
Hello.

1144
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:47,710
Well, what are you
doing here?

1145
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,710
Taking a lady's advice.

1146
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:58,030
What happened
to your eye, Bull?

1147
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,270
It was set upon
by 10...

1148
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,230
12!

1149
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:01,670
15 large, big lads.

1150
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,710
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1151
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,510
You've been busy.

1152
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,910
Ha ha ha!
We have guests!

1153
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:21,350
Bring them down!

1154
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:33,350
It works.

1155
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,710
Kind of.

1156
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,510
Of course it works.

1157
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,030
Great shot!
A beauty!

1158
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,590
All right, Wulf,
take your time, now.

1159
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,790
- Yeah!
- All right!

1160
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,510
That's good, Wulf...

1161
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:52,390
but can you do it
amidst distraction?

1162
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,270
Can you make the shot
when you must?

1163
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:58,550
Show him, Wulf.

1164
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,070
- Go on.
- You can do it.

1165
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:07,430
- Oh!
- Hey!

1166
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,550
Can you?

1167
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:11,270
Well, go on, Robin.

1168
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:13,390
It was a dirty trick.

1169
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:15,110
Oh, he's serious.

1170
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,430
Is his shirt
coming off at all?

1171
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:18,950

Well done.
Well done.

1175
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:44,550
This is grain...

1176
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:45,830
which any fool can eat...

1177
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:48,230
but for which
the Lord intended...

1178
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,110
a more divine means
of consumption.

This is blood money, Marian.

It's intended to bribe
King Richard's enemies...

No. Nottingham would not dare
challenge the king.

1192

he may lose his country.

We have a rule here.

1216
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:30,110
Once someone has seen
the way to our camp...

1217
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:31,990
that person cannot leave.

1218
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:35,070
There's too many lives at stake.

1219
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:38,430
That's why Sarah and I
asked to be blindfolded.

1220
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,390
Oh.

1221
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,670
Well, perhaps
you might join us for dinner.

1222
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:46,070
Perhaps.

Salaam, little one.

Did God paint you?

01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,350
Did God paint me?

1226
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,430
For certain.

1227
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:14,230
Why?

1228
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:18,110
Because...

1229
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:20,510
Allah loves
wondrous variety.

1230
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:29,050
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman...

1231
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:31,530
has found contentment
living rough...

1232
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,330
with the salt of the earth?

1233
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:35,250
I've seen
armored knights panic...

1234
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:38,130
at the first hint of battle...

1235
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,530
and I've seen the lowliest,
unarmed squire...

1236
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:43,410
pull a spear
from his own body...

1237
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:45,650
to defend a dying horse.

1238
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:48,570
Nobility's not a birthright.

1239
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:52,170
It's defined
by one's actions.

1240
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:55,290
It's interesting
to hear you say that.

1241
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:58,890
I didn't.
My father did.

1242
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:07,050
Did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him?

1243
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:10,930
I don't know.
All I know is...

1244
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:13,170
that our last words
in this world were...

1245
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,970
spoken in anger.

1246
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:17,370
I was lost
after my mother died.

1247
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:18,810
My father, too.

1248
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:21,690
And for a short time,
he found comfort...

1249
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:24,890
in the arms of another woman,
a peasant woman.

1250
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,610
I thought he was betraying
my mother's memory.

1251
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:31,050
So he gave her up?

1252
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,770
For the love
of a 12-year-old boy...

1253
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,690
who would never
forgive him.

1254
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:44,840

than this?

conveniently of love...

Oh!

This lady is spoken for.

Why this way?

1343
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,880
So you cannot
find the way back...

1344
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,760
or be forced to tell
others the way.

It was good to see
you again, Marian.

It was good to be seen.

I have two favors to ask of you.

- Take Duncan with you.

Can you take Lady Marian
safely home?

Yes, two.

You're King Richard's cousin.

He would believe you.

1364

If the sheriff found out,
I could lose all that I have.

That's true...

do it for your king?

Robin Hood has stolen what I was
to pay for their allegiance...

consorting with outlaws.

1506
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:09,660
No.

1507
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,020
Where do you hear
such lies?

1508
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:16,380
By your own hand, my lady.

1509
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,420
I'm sorry, my child.

1510
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:27,580
I feared you were
being led astray.

1511
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:31,420
Come.

1512
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:39,780
[Weeping]

1513
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:41,820
It's over.

1514
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:45,220
Today I return justice...

1515
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,060
to this land.

1516
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:49,460
I shall have to hang
the ringleaders, of course...

1517
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:51,860
but I would like
to be generous...

1518
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,780
and give you the lives...

1519
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:56,340
of the woodsmen
and their families...

1520
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:58,340
The children!

1521
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:01,300
And, of course...

1522
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,220
of your traitorous
lady-in-waiting...

1523
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,740
Get in there!

1524
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,180
as a wedding gift.

1525
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:16,340
And just who am I
supposed to marry?

1526
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:25,140
Search your heart, my child.

1527
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:28,340
Why not a union with
the House of Nottingham...

1528
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:30,980
and heal the wounds
in our land?

1529
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,340
There's only one man...

1530
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:35,380
who can heal the wounds
of this land... Robin Hood.

1531
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:49,420
I'm truly sorry, my lady.

1532
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,340
He wasted his life.

1533
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,180
How many more lives
would you waste?

1534
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:06,660
What a beautiful child.

1535
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:11,540
So young...

1536
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:13,580
so alive...

1537
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:18,100
so unaware of
how precarious life can be.

1538
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:25,940
I had a very sad childhood.

1539
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,860
I'll tell you
about it sometime.

1540
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:31,260
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1541
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:39,660
Marian...

1542
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,740
our bonding would
allow these children...

1543
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:45,300
to grow up as my allies.

1544
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:47,380
You understand...

1545
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:51,100
I cannot allow them
to grow up as my enemies.

1546
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:55,540
I have no choice.

1547
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,780
That's true.

1548
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:05,140
[Sobs]

1549
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:10,900
No.

1550
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:14,900
No!

1551
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:38,380
Look.

1552
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,340
Christian.

1553
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:56,100
Aah!

1554
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:04,340
Now I have heard...

1555
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:06,780
that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1556
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:12,460
Either tell me
where he may be hiding...

1557
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,420
or you'll all be hanged
and we'll catch him anyway...

1558
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,260
and do the same thing
to him.

1559
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:18,340
- I'd love to kill him for you.
- Will, no!

1560
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:25,420
So he is alive then.

1561
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,380
I'm not really sure.

1562
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:31,100
Then why would I need you?

1563
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:34,980
Because if he is alive,
I can get close to him.

1564
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:37,220
I'm one of his men.
He would never suspect me.

1565
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:39,340
- He knows you always hated him, traitor!
- Shut up!

1566
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,180
He's a trusting fool.
He'll believe me.

1567
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:46,340
If he doesn't, he'll kill me.
Then you've lost nothing.

1568
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:51,940
If you fail...

1569
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:56,100
I will personally remove
your lying tongue.

1570
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:38,450
My pride brought us to this.

1571
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:40,290
No, Sadiq.

1572
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:43,090
It was you who gave pride
to these people.

1573
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:47,410
I was a fool.

1574
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:51,770
I was a fool
to let them leave...

1575
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:54,490
to believe I'd planned
it all so perfectly.

1576
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:00,330
I once heard
a wise man say...

1577
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:04,090
there are no perfect men
in this world...

1578
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:06,930
only perfect intentions.

1579
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:15,250
You were an honor
to your countrymen today, Azeem.

1580
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:20,530
You fought better
than 20 English knights.

1581
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,330
Will!

1582
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:52,840
I thought you were taken.

1583
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:53,800
I was.

1584
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:55,560
How did you escape?

1585
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,170
Traitor!

1586
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,880
I'll wring your scrawny neck for you,
Will Scarlett!

1587
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,280
You get in there!
No bugger escapes the sheriff...

1588
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,080
not unless he's lining
his bloody pockets!

1589
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,040
Now, get in!

1590
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:09,000
Wait! Wait, John!

1591
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,160
Let him betray us?

1592
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,640
I'll have your guts for garters,
you little toad!

1593
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,240
Aah!

1594
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,640
- Bugger me.
- God.

1595
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:21,080
Let him speak.

1596
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,320
I bring a message...

1597
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,240
from Nottingham.

1598
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,200
Our men are to be hung
in the square...

1599
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,640
- at high noon tomorrow.
- What about my boy?

1600
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,840
The boy, too.

1601
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,480
Ten men in all.

1602
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,120
The hangings
are to be part...

1603
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:43,560
of the celebration
for the sheriff s marriage.

1604
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,080
Marriage? To who?

1605
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,800
Lady Marian.

1606
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,840
If he takes a bride
of royal blood...

1607
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,480
[LittleJohn]
Aye...

1608
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,720
and with
King Richard gone...

1609
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,120
he'll be after
the bloody throne.

1610
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:59,560
You were to use this news
to get close to me...

1611
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,760
and then kill me,
right, Will?

1612
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,160
What are your intentions?

1613
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,000
That depends on you, Locksley.

1614
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:13,200
I've never trusted you,
that's no secret.

1615
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,480
Are you going to finish
what you've started?

1616
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,520
Are you going to
turn and run...

1617
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,040
like the spoiled rich boy
I always took him for?

1618
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,080
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlett?

1619
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:29,400
Where does this intolerable hatred
for me come from?

1620
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:43,080
From knowing that our...

1621
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,120
our father loved you
more than me.

1622
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,240
Our father?

1623
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,720
We are brothers,
Robin of Locksley.

1624
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:54,240
I am the son
of the woman...

1625
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,160
who replaced your dead mother
for a time!

1626
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:58,960
It was your anger
that drove them apart!

1627
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,160
- It's a lie!
- It's not a lie!

1628
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,760
You ruined my life!

1629
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:18,000
I have more reason
to hate you than anyone...

1630
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:21,280
but I found myself
daring to believe in you.

1631
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,440
What I want
to know, brother...

1632
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,600
is will you stay
with us...

1633
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,520
and finish
what you've started?

1634
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:34,800
I have a brother?

1635
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,240
I have a brother.

1636
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,120
I will make
my stand with you...

1637
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,560
side by side...

1638
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,680
to the end.

1639
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,960
To the end!

1640
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,080
We're all bloody in.

1641
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,520
Daft buggers.

1642
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,280
We finish this.

1643
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:09,740
Aah! What was that?

1644
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:12,740
Truly you are a wizard!

1645
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:15,620
The mystery is
in the black powder.

1646
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:18,420
Surely the Lord will
grant us victory.

1647
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,420
- Bull.
- Yeah?

1648
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,100
Position by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1649
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:26,940
John, sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1650
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:29,900
I will conceal myself here
below the scaffold...

1651
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:33,300
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1652
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:35,580
No. I'll do that.
You cover us with your bow.

1653
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:37,900
It's too dangerous, Will.

1654
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:39,820
So is your aim.

1655
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:41,740
- Ha ha ha.
- [Explosion]

1656
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:43,180
Whatever Azeem
is concocting...

1657
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,100
we must each be
in place for it.

1658
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,500
Our success depends
on total concert.

1659
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:49,420
We may be only six men...

1660
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,860
Seven.

1661
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:52,300
What are you doing, woman?

1662
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:53,740
Where's the little ones?

1663
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,180
Safe with me mother.

1664
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,580
You gone bleeding cracked?
You'd get hurt.

1665
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,860
I've had eight babies.

1666
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:00,940
Don't talk to me
about getting hurt.

1667
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:03,820
I won't sit here
and let one of them die.

1668
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:07,020
You should be bloody well
minding the other seven.

1669
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:08,460
Tell her, Rob.

1670
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,660
Fanny...

1671
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:16,580
you will take position here.

1672
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,450
No blades, no bows.

1673
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,300
You'll leave your weapons here.

1674
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:35,690
No blades, no bows.

1675
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:38,140
Leave your weapons here.

1676
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,660
No blades, no bows.

1677
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:41,090
No blades.

1678
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:44,140
What have you
got there, Father?

1679
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,570
The lord's finest brew...

1680
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:47,980
for the good sheriff s
fighting men.

1681
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:50,490
It has a mighty kick, huh?

1682
01:49:53,730 --> 01:49:56,050
No blades, no bows.

1683
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:07,650
Hey, who are you?
Hey!

1684
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:09,650
Don't anger him.
He is a Celt.

1685
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:10,650
Shh!

1686
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:15,010
Psst.

1687
01:50:15,050 --> 01:50:17,330
John! John!

1688
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:49,410
Hey, you.

1689
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:51,890
Do I know you?

1690
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:53,810
Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1691
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,090
Oh, my God, you stink.

1692
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:58,610
Pardon my blindness.
I'm always falling...

1693
01:50:58,690 --> 01:51:00,890
Get out of here!

1694
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:03,050
Thank you
for noticing me, sir.

1695
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:04,250
Careful, Friar.

1696
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:08,130
What are you doing?

1697
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:10,610
Ah, distributing libations
for the celebration...

1698
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:12,890
of the sheriff s nuptials.

1699
01:51:12,930 --> 01:51:14,490
Why, is there
something amiss?

1700
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:16,890
You are. Get this stuff
out of here.

1701
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:18,810
Caesar has spoken,
my leprous friend.

1702
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:21,210
We shall collect
our offerings and depart.

1703
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,650
Is this your finger?

1704
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:23,610
Leper? What?

1705
01:51:23,650 --> 01:51:25,530
Get this cart out of here.

1706
01:51:25,570 --> 01:51:29,450
Leaving bits and pieces
of himself all over England.

1707
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:38,490
What are you doing here?

1708
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:41,330
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging.

1709
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:43,610
- What's in this bundle?
- That's firewood.

1710
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:45,650
- Psst.
- Hey!

1711
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:48,970
Aah!

1712
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:50,610
Hello, my lover.

1713
01:51:50,690 --> 01:51:54,130
Oyez, prepare
for the outdoor hanging.

1714
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:55,570
Oyez, prepare
for the outdoor hanging.

1715
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:58,690
Make way for
the Lord's work.

1716
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:00,610
No fighting here.

1717
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:02,650
Make way for
the Lord's work.

1718
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:05,690
A simple benediction for these
poor bastards about to stretch.

1719
01:52:05,730 --> 01:52:08,130
God receive them
in thy mercy...

1720
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:11,490
and show them the love
they so richly deserve...

1721
01:52:11,570 --> 01:52:14,370
even though they be
thieving sons of bitches.

1722
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:15,330
Hey!

1723
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:17,250
Nothing there
but trouble, boy.

1724
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:39,850
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1725
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:42,570
No more than
your wedding present.

1726
01:52:46,690 --> 01:52:48,050
Bring them out!

1727
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:49,690
Oh, they're coming!

Get on. Get your
heads up in there.

We're going to
get you vermin!

Aah! Stop, stop!

1736
01:54:30,490 --> 01:54:32,370
What's going on?

1737
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:33,930
Traitor!

1738
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:35,770
Bring him here!

1739
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,330
Kill him! Kill him!

1740
01:54:38,370 --> 01:54:40,370
What did I do?

1741
01:54:42,970 --> 01:54:45,010
Clear the way!
Clear the way!

1742

Stand still.

1743
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:50,130
Oh, the turncoat.

1744
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,850
Did you succeed?

1745
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:57,170
Well, I... I found
his lair, but, uh...

1746
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:58,770
he was already dead.

1747
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:01,970
You sure?
You saw Hood's body?

1748
01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:06,810
No... I saw a grave.

1749
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:09,490
We found this on him.

1750
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:15,210
String him up
with the others.

1751
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:17,290
Yay!

1752
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:21,850
Put me down!

1753
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:27,130
Let me go!

1754
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:33,610
Leave him.
He's only a boy.

1755
01:55:33,690 --> 01:55:35,050
Shut up!

1756

there's no more room.

I'm afraid I'll have
to respectfully decline.
