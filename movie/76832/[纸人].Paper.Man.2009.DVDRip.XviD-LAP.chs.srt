00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:56,710
这件事本身...很棒 你什么都不用
The fact of it... is fantastic that you made something

281
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:58,137
就能做出汤
from nothing.

282
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:00,047
哦 你可以...你可以…你知道
Oh, you can ... you can ...you know

283
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,802
用任何东西做汤
kind of make soup out of anything.

284
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:05,052
这是做汤最大的好处了
That's the great thing about it.

285
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:07,677
只要有东西在 
just whatever left things around, you know

286
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,680
你可以把冰箱里所有的东西拿出来
you can take all the crap that's surrounding in your frige and

287
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:15,117
就可以慢慢学着把汤做好
you can do it up that you can touch to the part you can make soup better

288
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,708
我比较喜欢熬汤
I go with a soup.

289
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:23,217
哦 实在太好喝了!

290
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,180
谢谢

291
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:27,586

292
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,114
这汤...美味无敌
It's... excellent.

293
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:32,238
你还记得当你发现
Do you remember the moment that you realized

294
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:34,711
汤不是从罐头倒出来的感觉吗?
the soup did not have to come out of a can?

295
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:36,396
你自己做
you've got manufactured

296
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:40,553
你自己做的鸡肉面比罐装鸡肉面好吃一千倍
Your chicken noodles can kick Campbell  noodles' ass any day all week

297
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,022
我觉得现在就有这种感觉
I think I'm having that moment right now.

298
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:49,286
还有 这个很有营养 不错
Plus, it is very nutritious which which is good.

299
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:03,861
呃…这是怎么回事?

300
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:05,678
噢 对不起…呃…
Oh, sorry ... uh ...

301
00:24:06,182 --> 00:24:08,268
那是我男朋友
It's just a boyfriend thing.

302
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:14,461
这鸟让我想起他
This bird kind of reminds me of him.

303
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:16,847
他就是个鸡屎
He's chicken shit.

304
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:20,322
实际上这并不是鸡
Actually it's not a chicken.

305
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,875
这是北美黑琴鸡
It's a North America Heath Hen

306
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:25,133
是鸡的亲戚 但严格来讲不算是鸡
Relative of great perit chicken, but not technically a chicken.

307
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:27,766
它现在已经灭绝了
It's extinct now.

308
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:31,642
最后的几只就住在这儿的自然保护区里
The last few lived out here out of the nature preserve

309
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:34,910
没听说过
I do not know that.

310
00:24:34,997 --> 00:24:36,731
我不是个鸟类专家什么的
I am not a birder or anything,

311
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:40,321
但是这最后的几只幸存者是那里面的重要角色
it just the the last surviving heath hen is a character ...

312
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
-呃   -什么里面?

说出来 好像很蠢
Saying it out loud, just sound kind of stupid.

319
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,162

330
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,531
为什么说你男朋友是鸡屎呢?
How come your boyfriend's a  chicken shit?

331
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:52,766
跟我无关 所以...
Not my business, so ...

332

335
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:08,307
不管怎么说 他就是该死的鸡屎

340
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,542
我坐在这个沙发上是不是特显胖

341

00:52:07,384 --> 00:52:09,158
该死 丫头 快点!
Damn, girl! Move your ass!

695
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:13,738
对不起
Sorry.

696
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,568
他跟踪你?
He was following you here?

697
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:38,050
理查德?
Richard?

698
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:50,202
-理查德 你在吗? -我就来了
- Richard, are you here? - I'll be right there.

699
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:54,269
别去!
Do not.

700
00:52:58,784 --> 00:53:00,472
嘿 你好吗?
Hey.How are you doing?

701
00:53:00,658 --> 00:53:03,179
-来吧 我带你去个地方 -太好了!
- Come on, I wanna show you something.- Great! Okay.

702
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:12,735
我的手出毛病了
I have a problem with my hands.

703
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:15,028
什么意思?
What do you mean?

704
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:17,044
他们不听我使唤
They won't do what I want them to do.

705
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,744
你想让他们做什么?
What do you want them to do?

706
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:21,391
任何事 我不知道
Anything. I do not know.

707
00:53:21,454 --> 00:53:22,693
一些有意义的事 
Something useful.

708
00:53:22,694 --> 00:53:25,018
我想让他们去创造一些或者...
I want them to build something or ...

709
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,169
制造一些什么
make something.

710
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,217
比如?
Like what?

711
00:53:27,531 --> 00:53:30,152
即使耶稣 我是说如果他是个木匠
Even Jesus, I mean if he was a carpenter.

712
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:32,714
那也不足以拯救人类
It was not enough to save mankind

713
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,090
他也需要原材料
he needed a tray.

714
00:53:34,342 --> 00:53:38,015
我是个脆弱的人 毫无存在感 
I am a flimsy man and insubstancial.

715
00:53:38,016 --> 00:53:40,465
那只是和耶稣比起来
Well, compared to Jesus ...

716
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:44,683
-我是个纸人 - 不 你是个作家
- I am a paper man.- No, you're a writer.

717
00:53:44,994 --> 00:53:48,493
- 对 说的没错  -对 没错
- Yeah, that's crucial. - Yeah, it is.

718
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:54,056
我们到了
Here we are.

719
00:53:55,363 --> 00:53:56,519
到哪了?
Where?

720
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,343
也许 大海也一样
It is possible, so is sea

721
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:03,743
生命和土地一旦被反对
life and land with certain decries,

722
00:54:03,806 --> 00:54:05,977
此生就无法再次相会
quietly was never see other again

723
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:08,901
我写过那个吗? 我写的
Did I write that? I wrote that.

724
00:54:11,493 --> 00:54:12,729
拿着这个
Hold this.

725
00:54:21,484 --> 00:54:22,539
艾比?
Abby?

726
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:27,197
艾比?
Abby?

727
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:29,886
艾比?
Abby?

728
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:35,963
别这样!
Come on!

729
00:54:36,928 --> 00:54:37,964
艾比?
Abby?

730
00:54:39,524 --> 00:54:40,651
艾比?
Abby?

731
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:48,025
天啊!你在干什么?
Jesus!What are you doing?

732
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:51,079
你想干什么?
What are you doing?

733
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:04,391
你不能这么做
You can not do this.

734
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:06,276
不能这样做
Can't do that.

735
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:27,899
是我不敢下水
It was me that daren't going.

736
00:55:32,547 --> 00:55:33,962
那天真的很冷
It was really cold.

737
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:39,213
比今天要冷得多 但是...
It was much, much colder than today, but ...

738
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,615
你知道 她不想退缩
You know, she wasn't gonna turn down the dare.

739
00:55:45,085 --> 00:55:46,492
你会那样的
You will like that

740
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,163
我也不想当什么女冒险家 所以...
And I woudln't be neither adventuress, so...

741
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,770
我不知道她为什么也跳进水里
I do not know why she went in.

742
00:55:56,969 --> 00:55:58,563
穿着衣服
In her cloths. ..

743
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,674
我想可能那样更暖和
I guess it maybe sort of warmer.

744
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,654
她在笑
And she was laughing.

745
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:19,298
你知不知道
And you know.

746
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,520
好
Fine.

747
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:25,163
然后她就...唔...
And she was..Um...

748
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:29,235
她很平静
And she was calm.

749
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,405
一直往下沉 
Just under

750
00:56:35,406 --> 00:56:39,040
再没回来...
and gone and. ..

751
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:43,985
我就站在那里
I just stood there.

752
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:50,472
几个小时之后 妈妈来了
And in a couple of hours my mom came.

753
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:54,099
找到了我 我想 嗯..
And found me and I guess, you know.

754
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:58,907
我正在等她游回来 但是...
as waiting for her to swim back in, but ...

755
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:02,437
她再也没回来
she never did.

756
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:05,817
她多大?
How old?

757
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:07,930
和我一样大
Same just with me.

758
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:10,285
我们是双胞胎
We were twins.

759
00:57:10,753 --> 00:57:14,789
噢! 噢 天啊!
Oh! Oh, my God!

760
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,648
那是很久以前的事了
That was a long time ago.

761
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,885
我每年都回去那里 游回岸上
I'd like to go out there every year. Swim back to shore.

762
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:26,475
我喜欢感受那种冷
You know, I like to feel the cold.

763
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:33,437
你肯定...我不知道该说些什么
You must have...I don't know what to say.

764
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:39,936
所以我们都只是孩子
So we were both only children.

765
00:57:56,328 --> 00:57:57,844
那是我们的宿命
That was our fate.

766
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:01,048
每年 你都知道
Every year, and you knew it.

767
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:04,522
可你把那个人带去
And you take that guy out there.

768
00:58:06,595 --> 00:58:07,811
就在这个日子
On this day.

769
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,876
他甚至都不认识她
He didn't even know her.

770
00:58:12,231 --> 00:58:13,249
我知道
I know.

771
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,625
记得以前只有我才和你讲话吗?
Remember when I was the only one who talked to you?

772
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:18,779
聊的很久
For a long time.

773
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:21,060
我记得 但是...
I know, but ...

774
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:22,688
他并不爱你
He doesn't love you.

775
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,249
你的想法是错的
That's your think you're wrong.

776
00:58:26,613 --> 00:58:27,970
你想我说什么?
What do you want me to say?

777
00:58:28,184 --> 00:58:30,157
我可能要去加利福尼亚一段时间
I gotta some move to California.

778
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:33,375
你不能以为我会一直陪在你身边
Shouldn't just assume my always being around

779
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,831
因为某天...也许我不会了...
because one day ... Maybe I won't.

780
00:58:35,935 --> 00:58:38,059
天呐! 别说了!
God! Stop it.

781
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:40,861
那就是你想要的吗?
Is this what you want?

782
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,403
我没什么故事可说 是吧?
I don't have much history, do I?

783
00:58:51,934 --> 00:58:53,176
的确有影响
That is relative visible.

784
00:58:53,527 --> 00:58:54,527
一点不错
Exactly.

785
00:58:55,496 --> 00:58:57,246
别人的生活都有改观
Other people seem to have revise.

786
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,955
他们人生经历丰富
Things happen to them.

787
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,310
生命充满各种传奇色彩
Life all turn in occurrences.

788
00:59:00,892 --> 00:59:02,186
我也曾经有所作为
I used to do things.

789
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,905
-还记得吗? - 跟你无关
-Remember? -This is not about you.

790
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:07,590
奇妙的经历
Amazing things.

791
00:59:09,707 --> 00:59:10,892
那你想要我说什么?
What do you want me to say?

792
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:11,965
我不知道
I don't know.

793
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:15,640
别 别 告诉我你想要我谈些什么?
No, no. Tell me what you want me to say literally,

794
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:17,481
因为我完全不知道该说什么
because frankly poorly I got nothing.

795
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:20,452
过来
Come here.

796
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:28,030
但你必须去接触人情世故 
But you have to touch civilizers,

797
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,340
理查德 就你的工作来看
Richard,through your work

798
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:31,779
你让她不快 所以你才不快乐
thought about your happiness be the happiness you brought to her biz.

799
00:59:44,783 --> 00:59:45,867
嘿 呃 是这样 
Hey,um,look!

800
00:59:45,868 --> 00:59:47,765
明晚有个为患病儿童的募捐活动
It's the fundraiser for the children in hospital tomorrow night

801
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:50,734
我想把那瓶1971年的

803
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:55,585
我知道我们在省钱以备不测
I know I was saving up for a special occasion,

804
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,303
但是那能算什么? 所以...你觉得如何?
but what for that cost? So ...What do you think?

805
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:04,814
理查德 你把酒喝了?
Richard, did you drink that wine?

806
01:00:04,937 --> 01:00:07,749
那瓶值5,000元的酒
That five-thousand-dollar bottle of wine

807
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:10,360
也不是很贵 都是为了孩子
It's not the raft. It was for the children.

808
01:00:10,843 --> 01:00:12,280

嗨
Hi

857
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:34,910
当世界面临危险
When the world is in peril.

858
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:37,710
恶魔在你身边
When evil is around you.

859
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:38,907
当危险……
When danger ...

-理查德 帮帮我   -你不喜欢这样么?
- Richard, help me.  - You don't like it?

862
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:51,247
家具全在外面
All furniture is outside and. ..

863
01:03:51,972 --> 01:03:53,404
这他妈的都是什么东西?
What the hell is this?

864
01:03:53,966 --> 01:03:56,265
你的手势可以看出来貌似你很失望
You seem disappointed, you're going up with your body language.

865
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:58,869
这周你一次电话都没接
You don't pick up the phone once this week.

866
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:59,870
你一个电话
You don't

867
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:01,120
都不打给我
Call me once.

868
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:04,121
我一路赶过来就看到这个!
I traveled all the way out here and there's this!

869
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,745
理查德 给我个解释
Richard, say something.

870
01:04:07,402 --> 01:04:08,792
嗯 我……
Well, I ...

871
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:21,154
-这是什么?  -什么是什么?
- What is it?  - What is what?

872
01:04:21,264 --> 01:04:22,672
这个 这是谁的?
This? Whose is it?

873
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:24,790
理查德 告诉她
Richard, just tell her.

874
01:04:25,967 --> 01:04:27,547
- 克莱尔?  -怎么了?
- Claire? - Yes?

875
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:33,590
我们是真的不快乐还是只是装作不快乐?
Are we unhappy or are we just pretendding to be unhappy?

876
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,400
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

877
01:04:36,432 --> 01:04:38,774
我们只是为了给生活加点味道
Are we just pretending to be unhappy,

878
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:41,079
才装作不高兴吗?
to add dramaes to our life?

879
01:04:41,182 --> 01:04:44,205
这样会让我们觉得实在点吗?
So that we seem somehow more substantial?

880
01:04:45,204 --> 01:04:46,453
我的意思是 试想:
I mean, think about it:

881
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:48,650
我们的生活并不窘迫
Our lives are embarrassingly easy.

882
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,842
我们有充裕的钱
We got plenty of money.

883
01:04:49,843 --> 01:04:50,943
我们有朋友
We got friends.

884
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,140
嗯 你有朋友
Well, you got friends.

885
01:04:52,215 --> 01:04:54,815
世界上窘迫的人多的是
There are people out there who have real problems.

886
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:55,816
你知道么?
You know?

887
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:59,025
的的确确有原因令他们不快乐
Real reasons to be unhappy.

888
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:03,585
我是说我可能是个还不起债 或者什么的矿工
I mean I could be a coal miner dying of black loan , or something.

889
01:05:03,673 --> 01:05:06,928
或者是西西那提街头买个菜都砍半天价的
You could be a Cincinnati clack on foodstuff

890
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:08,117
-什么?  -我不知道
-What?  - I do not know.

891
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:11,950
我只是觉得 我们不在让生活变得虚假
I'm just on it. Doesn't it feel like we were faking it

892
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:14,054
不开心都是装出来的吗?
our unhappiness?

893
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,616
不
No.

894
01:05:18,336 --> 01:05:19,589
不 是真的
No. It's real.

895
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:21,053
很真
It is very real.

896
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:26,638
我要回家了
I'm going home now.

897
01:05:32,772 --> 01:05:35,740
我认为你觉得这生活很好
I think you think this's still charming.

898
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:37,715
我们不是小孩子了
We aren't 23 any more.

899
01:05:37,795 --> 01:05:39,365
你要好好想清楚
You need to pull it together.

900
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:41,962
这周记着接电话

How great the guy is he.

979
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:42,758
我以为没人来呢
No body wants the party

980
01:11:46,032 --> 01:11:49,373

Tim-tim!

984
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:48,555
高中生活对我来说就是发现自我的过程
High School for me was a time of self-discovery.

985
01:12:50,552 --> 01:12:52,873
想想以前 我真蠢
When I look back I'm dull.

986
01:12:53,297 --> 01:12:56,140
真恶心 你不想再回到十七岁了 对吧?
Got a sick You would not want to be 17 years again, uhm?

987
01:12:59,756 --> 01:13:01,625

- What?- What the fuck are you doing?

991
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:25,511
艾比怎么办?

992
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:26,999
再见艾比
Goodbye, Abby.

993
01:14:27,124 --> 01:14:29,592
你搞她好了 你别搞那小女孩

994
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:31,746
别管闲事 变态
Mind your own business,you pervert.

995
01:14:31,998 --> 01:14:33,142
鸡屎

01:14:34,089 --> 01:14:36,542
-在叫我么?-鸡屎小混蛋
-What do you call me? - Chicken shit bastard.

997

不准你这样跟我说话

你不能这么跟我说话 草泥马
You do not talk to me like that,you fucking weired

999
01:14:45,017 --> 01:14:46,904
你以为我怕你这个屁孩么
You think you can thread me you a child.

1000
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:50,832
我是个屁孩 哈?我就是屁孩
I'm a child, huh? That's what I am

1001
01:14:51,027 --> 01:14:53,654

-你没事吧? -怎么回事?

-住口!-你和她胡搞了?

我操才不管
I do not give a shit.

01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:05,775
你可以要她 她也他妈的疯

1009
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:08,204

1017
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:29,013
鸡屎

1024
01:15:55,315 --> 01:16:00,097
嗯…呃…一个合适的方式
I think .. uh ... in an appropriate way.

1025
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,858
我觉得你该知道
I  I thing you should know.

1026
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:10,366
我发现我审视
I discovered I just find when I examined

1027
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:15,774
自己的内心时 我发现…
my heart, I found ...

1028
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:22,855
我觉得心里有爱
I think there's love there.

1029
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:26,418
是对你的爱
For you.

我爱你
I love you.

1032
01:16:47,038 --> 01:16:49,600
不是... 不是只有爱这个词儿
it wasn't... it wasn't really of love only being in use.

1033
01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:54,455
我是说 我曾经很孤独 
I mean, as lonely as ever, I called on months

1034
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:56,845
大喊大叫了几个月直到我...
you know just until I ...

1035
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:05,539
我父母以为...
My parents thought of ...

1036
01:17:09,174 --> 01:17:10,485
我不知道
I don't know.

1037
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,268
我从来没告诉过他们这些
I never told them.

1038
01:17:19,952 --> 01:17:21,173
从来也没有
Never ...

1039
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,296
告诉其他任何人
told anyone else.

1040
01:17:26,848 --> 01:17:28,288
那是个约定
That was a pact.

1041
01:17:36,273 --> 01:17:41,115
我和艾米都会去
me and Amy were both there to go.

1042
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:46,260
下水去 可她没有
enter the water and she didn't...

1043
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:52,115
没有游回岸上
didn't swim back.

1044
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:00,353
我游回来了
I swam back.

1045
01:18:03,386 --> 01:18:04,793
我应该能...我应该能...
I could ...I could...

1046
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,764
我不知道什么使我们如此不开心 我是说
I do not know what we were so unhappy about. I mean ...

1047
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:22,460
我们怎么能这么不开心
How could we be so unhappy about ...

1048
01:18:25,209 --> 01:18:26,730
八岁
 8

1049
01:18:32,261 --> 01:18:33,935
我想 你还太小 
I think you ...you are too young to know

1050
01:18:33,936 --> 01:18:36,865
不知道你能跨过很多所谓的坎儿
you can get over anything.

1051
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,521
他总是做出错误的决定
He's always made poor decisions.

1052
01:19:21,604 --> 01:19:22,986
她也是
same with her.

1053
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,486
我真感到无助
I feel helpless.

1054
01:19:31,284 --> 01:19:32,550
你陪她多久了?
How long have you been with her?

1055
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:34,877
从她八岁的时候
Since she was 8.

1056
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,177
你呢?
You?

1057
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:40,722
天啊 都有四十多年了
Oh, Christ, it's got to be over 40 years.

1058
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:45,082
二年级开始
second grade.

1059
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:47,688
所以他对于你来说年龄有点大了
So he was a little old for you?

1060
01:19:48,142 --> 01:19:49,770
我一直这样跟他讲
I keep telling him that.

1061
01:19:51,175 --> 01:19:52,506
可他从来听不进去
He never listens.

1062
01:19:53,427 --> 01:19:55,003
他从来听不进去? -对啊
He never do? - No.

1063
01:19:57,202 --> 01:19:58,463
你主要干什么?
What is your dig?

1064
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:02,182
我肯定我做了太多了
I must have done them all.

1065
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:07,295
床下恶魔 啦啦队长 
Monsters under the bed, a cheerleader,

1066
01:20:08,309 --> 01:20:09,386
执行者... 
governor...

1067
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:14,847
这些天不是告诉他真相的好时机
These days have not been the right time to tell him the truth.

1068
01:20:14,901 --> 01:20:15,919
你呢?
And you?

1069
01:20:16,014 --> 01:20:17,638
我疯狂地爱着她
I'm crazy in love with her.

1070
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:21,574
噢 不容易啊  - 是啊 
- oh! tough one. - Yeah.

1071
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,448
真快
It's been hurry.

1072
01:20:26,063 --> 01:20:27,812
我想她快要跟我说再见了
I think She's almost done with me.

1073
01:20:27,978 --> 01:20:32,217
好 太好了 能跑就跑
Good, Great,  Run away while you can.

1074
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:37,070
告诉她开门 你走
Tell her to open the door and you run.

1075
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,196
你不想像我这样吧
You don't want to end up like me.

1076
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,814
不想
I guess not.

1077
01:20:47,626 --> 01:20:51,781
- 万能上校 - 克斯特佛
- Captain Excellent. - Christopher.

1078
01:20:53,323 --> 01:20:54,633
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

1079
01:20:56,062 --> 01:20:57,289
再见
See you around.

1080
01:21:39,668 --> 01:21:40,981
噢
Oh!

1081
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,219

1082
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,157
干吗 干吗
What? What?

1083
01:21:49,233 --> 01:21:50,605
停一下
Wait a second.

1084
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,251
混蛋!
Son of bitch!

1085
01:21:52,689 --> 01:21:54,920
不要这样
Do not react here.

1086
01:21:55,008 --> 01:21:56,243
别告诉我该怎样
Do not tell me how to react.

1087
01:21:56,321 --> 01:21:57,980
-不像你想的那样 -闭嘴
- It's not like that. - Shut up.

1088
01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:01,010
什么? 这是怎么回事? 理查德
What? What is this? Richard

1089
01:22:01,103 --> 01:22:03,697
她是谁? 操她妈到底是谁?
Who is that? Who the fuck is that?

1090
01:22:03,806 --> 01:22:05,086
她是保姆
She is the babysitter.

1091
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,165
出去 出去
Get out. Get out.

1092
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:10,403
出去!
Get out!

1093
01:22:13,374 --> 01:22:14,917

1095
01:22:18,169 --> 01:22:19,654
克莱尔 我们去...
Claire we'll just be ...

1096
01:22:22,678 --> 01:22:25,014
如果你在想我是不是跟保姆睡了 我没有
I did not sleep with the babysitter, if that's what you think of.

1097
01:22:25,211 --> 01:22:26,577
哦? 你可真会安慰人
Oh, that is so comforting.

1098
01:22:26,952 --> 01:22:28,649
我们为什么要雇保姆呢?
Why do we even have a babysitter?

1099
01:22:28,764 --> 01:22:31,447
是个啤酒聚会  克莱尔 就这样
It was just a kegger, Claire. That was all.

1100
01:22:31,734 --> 01:22:32,918
只是个聚会
just a kegger?

1101
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:35,491
那么你到底跟谁一起开聚会呢?
And with whom exactly did you have a kegger?

1102
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:37,044
就是些上高中的孩子
just kids from high school .

1103
01:22:37,098 --> 01:22:38,676
理查德 不要说了
Richard, just stop.

1104
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:40,898
这些都不对劲儿 - 好吧
none of this is ok. -ok

1105
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:42,742
你知道这个周末我们要来
You knew we were coming this weekend.

1106
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:44,199
你为什么要这么做?
Why are you doing this?

1107
01:22:44,272 --> 01:22:46,199
我有点迷茫
I've been a bit at a loss.

1108
01:22:47,086 --> 01:22:48,459
真是个烂借口
what a bullshit answer.

1109
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:51,051
我很孤独 艾比很...
I was being flandering and Abby was being ...

1110
01:22:51,116 --> 01:22:52,659
什么? 艾比怎样?
What? Abby was being what?

1111
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:54,597
友善 像个朋友
A friend.

1112
01:22:54,793 --> 01:22:57,168
天哪 她不是朋友 她是个孩子
For God's sake, that is not a friend, that's a child.

1113
01:22:57,241 --> 01:22:58,991
你有朋友  -我没有
- You do have friends. - No, I do not.

1114
01:22:59,459 --> 01:23:03,663
我觉得有麻烦了
I think that is a touble here…

1115
01:23:03,909 --> 01:23:06,099
因为你跟其它人都没有联系
Cause you do not have a relate to other human beings.

1116
01:23:06,885 --> 01:23:08,677
对 你把自己同其他人隔离开了
Yeah, you isolate yourself.

1117
01:23:08,789 --> 01:23:09,612
哦 你可以这样说
Oh, you can talk.

1118
01:23:09,613 --> 01:23:11,054
你这该死的话什么意思?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1119
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,650
原来你可以这么残忍 克莱尔
You can be cold, Claire.

1120
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,211
我想我们得走了
I think we just get out of here.

1121
01:23:15,597 --> 01:23:16,925
我想我们得离开这儿
We just get out of here

1122
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:18,543
赶紧离开
leave this area.

1123
01:23:20,377 --> 01:23:22,833
-去哪? - 我不知道 除随便
- Where? - I do not know, anywhere.

1124
01:23:23,414 --> 01:23:25,846
我不知道是不是你的职业 让你变得冷酷 
I don't know if it's your profession or what... you know, but it makes your heart.

1125
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:26,614
我接受不了
I cannot and I don't accept that.

1126
01:23:26,706 --> 01:23:28,110
我想要个孩子
I wanna to have a baby

1127
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:31,047
就这样而已?
Is that what this is all about?

1128
01:23:31,111 --> 01:23:32,708
我们可以有个孩子的 克莱尔
We could have a baby, Claire.

1129
01:23:32,913 --> 01:23:35,048
为什么我们没要个孩子呢 为什么?
Why did not we have a baby? Why?

1130
01:23:35,132 --> 01:23:36,633
因为你自己就是个孩子
Because you're a baby.

1131
01:23:36,766 --> 01:23:38,050
你真没用
You're an enfant.

1132
01:23:38,393 --> 01:23:40,547
就算到现在你还有个假想的朋友
You still have an imaginary friend.

1133
01:23:40,644 --> 01:23:43,158
我只是想要一个 一开始就可以跟它在一起的
I just wanted a little warm thing.

1134
01:23:43,297 --> 01:23:45,392
小小的 温暖的 单纯的东西 
Something simple  I could start with.

1135
01:23:45,444 --> 01:23:48,735
跟某个人建立一种新的 纯洁的关系
A simple relationship with a person that was new and pure.

1136
01:23:48,915 --> 01:23:50,609
我可以做自己 他们可以做他们
well, I could be me, they could be them.

1137
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:52,969
这就是我想我们能创造的东西
and that's all I've expected we can build.

1138
01:23:53,046 --> 01:23:56,672
在这个世界上 除我之外还有
In this world there's someone other than me

1139
01:23:56,738 --> 01:23:59,006
我可以想念 可以想成为的人
to think about and be about.

1140
01:23:59,657 --> 01:24:03,797
有一种能够分享世界给其他人的宽慰感
and the relief of being able to give the world to someone else

1141
01:24:04,879 --> 01:24:06,798
让他们也能这么做
and let it be there and let them have their turn.

1142
01:24:06,893 --> 01:24:08,943
所有的一切不会因为我的死而终结
so it doesn't end with me.

1143
01:24:09,955 --> 01:24:14,878
那这是你所想的 那我呢?
Well that's all you, Where do I come in?

1144
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:17,672
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1145
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:19,516
天啊 你是他们的妈妈啊
God, you're the mother.

1146
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:25,181
呃 伙计们 我们非常抱歉 
Ah, I am so sorry, guys.

1147
01:24:25,182 --> 01:24:27,830
我们要走了 我们就是要走了
We are gonna go we're just gonna go...

1148
01:24:27,892 --> 01:24:31,193
我可以去哪都行的
We can be just anywhere Anywhere.

1149
01:24:31,642 --> 01:24:34,404
真抱歉 -没事儿 我们出去就行了  
I'm so sorry.- No no no. All right.

1150
01:24:34,405 --> 01:24:35,786
我送你们 对不起
We're just going out  -I will walk you out I'm sorry

1151
01:24:35,827 --> 01:24:37,546
你们一起出去一下吧
Wish you all go on a crew or something

1152
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:42,202
好吧
Okay.

1153
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,189
保重
Okay. Take care.

1154
01:25:11,448 --> 01:25:12,730
好吧 如果我们要这样吵的话 我们...
Alright. if we are gonna do this, let's ...

1155
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,980
顺便问一下 她多大了 十三岁? 十四岁?
Alright, by the way, what's she like? like 13,14?

1156
01:25:16,423 --> 01:25:18,825
至少先解决问题
At least we'll get the fact straight.

1157
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,939
是你 理查德 是你不想要孩子 
It was you, Richard. you didn't want to have a baby.

1158
01:25:22,012 --> 01:25:24,999
你没准备好
you weren't ready.

1159
01:25:25,108 --> 01:25:27,322
你当着我朋友面讲的温情兮兮的话纯粹是扯淡
so that little fuzzy fucking speech my friends had to hear was bull shit.

1160
01:25:28,073 --> 01:25:30,859
我知道我...我讲不出来
now, I know that I'm...  I can't.

1161
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:34,797
我想是我不好
so I guess I am the bad guy.

1162
01:25:38,798 --> 01:25:39,946
别碰小说
No not the novel that's…

1163
01:25:39,947 --> 01:25:41,451
我宁愿你…
I'd rather you didn't...

1164
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:44,109
这是什么? 这是什么? 
What is this? What is this?

1165
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,782
就是我的创作
That's it.

1166
01:25:47,918 --> 01:25:50,388
呆了这么长时间 就写了这些?
After all this time out here and this is it?

1167
01:25:50,443 --> 01:25:51,480
就这些?
this is That?

1168
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:54,762
或许下次你该忙一下工作
Maybe you should spent more time working instead of ...

1169
01:25:55,044 --> 01:25:56,513
而不是和小保姆做
fucking the babysitter.

1170
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:58,385
-不是 我...-你没用  -对
- No. I. .. - You're useless.  -Yes

1171
01:25:58,515 --> 01:26:01,222
-你彻底没用! -是 我没用
- You are totally useless! - Yes. I am.

1172
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:02,910
你到底怎么回事?
What is wrong with you?

1173
01:26:02,982 --> 01:26:06,419
我不知道我这双手能干什么
I do not know what to do with my hands.

1174
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:16,562
所有人
Everyone.

1175
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:20,452
珍妮斯 我姐姐和奥利夫都觉得
Janeth, my sister and Olive all have been made

1176
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:22,392
我有一个让我开心的人
I have the one who made me laugh.

1177
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,000
是怎么回事?
What happened?

1178
01:26:24,048 --> 01:26:25,423
我不知道是怎么回事
I do not know what happened.

1179
01:26:26,171 --> 01:26:27,673
你不再笑了
You stopped laughing.

1180
01:27:29,282 --> 01:27:31,866
-要帮忙吗? -嗯
- May I help you? - Yeah.

1181
01:27:31,939 --> 01:27:33,616
我来这悼念
I came here to pay my respects.

1182
01:27:33,817 --> 01:27:36,764
什么? -黑琴鸡 北美黑琴鸡…
- sorry? - Heath Hen, the North American Heath Hen...

1183
01:27:36,963 --> 01:27:40,001
这就是最后一只生活和死亡的地方
it's where the last one lived and died.

1184
01:27:40,149 --> 01:27:42,843
我对黑琴鸡一无所知
I don't know anything about the Heath Hen.

1185
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:45,908
但是欢迎你到处逛逛
But you are welcome to look around.

1186
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:47,969
我们有好几个品种
We've got several varieties of proper.

1187
01:27:48,063 --> 01:27:49,126
谢谢
Thank you.

1188
01:28:14,144 --> 01:28:16,551
这么说这就是结束
So that is what the end of something looks like.

1189
01:28:16,767 --> 01:28:18,375
地球依然在转 理查德
The world went on, Richard.

1190
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:19,737
但是不会一样了
But never the same.

1191
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:21,720
虽然我们不知道究竟改变了多少 
We do not know how much it changes things.

1192
01:28:21,721 --> 01:28:22,728
但是终究是改变了
but it is just being here.

1193
01:28:22,783 --> 01:28:24,133
事实的余波
The ripple of the fact.

1194
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:25,966
如果这里的鸡没有灭绝 
if the chicken hadn't died out here,

1195
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,350
或许你就跟其它人一样了
you will be perfectly adusted.

1196
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:28,424
或许
Maybe.

1197
01:28:28,507 --> 01:28:29,549
我真怀疑
Doubtful.

1198
01:28:31,776 --> 01:28:33,486
我不是小孩 是个失败者 
Instead of a child, I am a loser

1199
01:28:33,568 --> 01:28:35,579
注定了要相信上校
and I am condemned to believe in Captain.

1200
01:28:35,987 --> 01:28:37,507
像个小手
it's like a little hand.

1201
01:28:42,237 --> 01:28:44,549
你...你该离开了
It's ...It's time for you to go.

1202
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:46,851
不
No.

1203
01:28:47,702 --> 01:28:49,735
你知道我的意思 上校
You know what I am saying, Captain.

1204
01:28:53,836 --> 01:28:57,247
我是说 走吧 再别回来了
I mean, go and never come back.

1205
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:00,214
我还不放心
I'm not ready.

1206
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:02,384
不重要了
it doesn't matter.

1207
01:29:03,134 --> 01:29:04,914
你再也不能帮我了
You can not help me anymore.

1208
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:08,633
医生是对的
The doctor is right.

1209
01:29:09,029 --> 01:29:10,354
但是你会孤单
but You will be alone.

1210
01:29:10,821 --> 01:29:11,872
是
Yes

1211
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:14,402
我是最后一个
as the last of my kind.

1212
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:20,603
好吧
OK.

1213
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:26,115
喊口号吧
do the voice.

1214
01:29:27,823 --> 01:29:29,049
喊最后一次
One last time.

1215
01:29:32,737 --> 01:29:33,855
求你了
Please.

1216
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,113
当世界面临危险
When the world is peril.

1217
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:47,132
当恶魔在你身边
When evil surrounds you.

1218
01:29:49,269 --> 01:29:50,895
当危险潜伏而至
When danger is lurking.

1219
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:57,222
你会叫谁?
Who do you call?

1220
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,957
优秀上校!
Captain Excellent!

1221
01:31:30,489 --> 01:31:35,489
我希望我有一个像他棒的好父亲
I wish I had a really amazing and vital father like him.

1222
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:07,110
上校?
Captain?

1223
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:18,602
理查漫 孤芳…
Richmond regarded his solitude... The ...

1224
01:32:18,772 --> 01:32:22,694
莫顿孤芳 诺顿孤芳

1226

诺伍德孤芳
Norwood regarded his solitude...The ...

1227
01:32:32,286 --> 01:32:35,691
理查德? 理查德?
Richard? Richard?

1228
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:44,428
理查德!
Richard!

1229
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:00,345
理查德 孤芳自赏
Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred.

1230
01:33:38,843 --> 01:33:42,705
我昨晚梦见. ..
I had dreams last night and uh. ..

1231
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:44,278
梦见了你

1232
01:33:45,606 --> 01:33:46,927
嗯? 是有趣的事儿吗?
ah? was it interesting?

1233
01:33:48,811 --> 01:33:50,364
你还是你
you were you.

1234
01:33:53,841 --> 01:33:55,330
你要走了,是吗?
You're leaving, aren't you?

1235
01:33:58,093 --> 01:33:59,123
是啊 你知道 是因为

1236
01:34:01,157 --> 01:34:02,606
这种局面
- situation ...

1237

我知道
I figured it.

你知道吗 春天
You know, spring is ...

1240
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:17,104
是我最喜欢的季节
my favorite time.

1241
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:21,107
因为夏天还没到
cause summer has not arrived yet.

1242
01:34:21,872 --> 01:34:23,340
而且不会那么要命的寒冷
and it's not fucking cold.

1243
01:34:27,502 --> 01:34:29,339
呃  我

1244

1245
01:34:45,407 --> 01:34:47,094
是天鹅
It is the swan.

1246

美丽优雅的天鹅
The beautiful and graceful swan.

1247

感觉好像我们刚刚认识那会儿
It seems like that we were just come started.

1251

1252
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,240
好
Okay.

1253

就这样吧
okay

1254
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:44,570
我是个混蛋
I am a horse's ass.

1255
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:50,281
对 你就是
Yes, you are.

1257
01:38:20,858 --> 01:38:23,472
我需要帮手把沙发重放回屋里
I kind of need some help to get this couch in.

1258
01:38:32,795 --> 01:38:35,891
理查德孤芳自赏 把它看做神圣
Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred.

1259
01:38:36,315 --> 01:38:38,607
和光荣的勋章
As well as a badge of honor.

1260
01:38:39,732 --> 01:38:42,756
是提醒我们要让生活温暖
A clock to be warned of warm to life

1261
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:44,452
和安全的警钟
As well as safety.

1262
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:47,893
他整个人都是孤独的
Solitude is who he was.

1263
01:38:48,027 --> 01:38:52,130
孤独影响了他的生活,使他对生活不满意
This cast those into his lives to make him feel barely content.

1264
01:38:52,778 --> 01:38:55,129
理查德知道没有人像他一样
Richard was certain that there was not lined.

1265
01:38:55,214 --> 01:38:56,733
这对于一个人来说简直太难受了
It was just hard on man.

1266
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:59,116
他之所以没有所得可能是因为
maybe it was because

1267
01:38:59,117 --> 01:39:00,965
他没有付出 也没有收获
he gave nothing and he received nothing in return.

1268
01:39:01,152 --> 01:39:04,568
不管如何 这种境况都让人无法忍受
In any case, the situation became untolerable.

1269
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:09,539
那些他视作朋友的东西不是虚幻的就是灭绝了
the closed things he had as his friends were either imaginary or extinct.

1270
01:39:10,007 --> 01:39:11,808
理查德了解他自己的生活
Richard had reached a point in his life

1271
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,663
但是不够深入
but it was no longer enough.

1272
01:39:16,474 --> 01:39:18,055
后来他遇到了个女孩
And then he met a girl.

1273
01:39:19,318 --> 01:39:20,659
她让人感觉很温暖
And she was warm.

1274
01:39:21,307 --> 01:39:22,693
但是她很忧伤
And she was sad.

1275
01:39:22,836 --> 01:39:26,569
或许她还很孤单 这多少让他想到了他自己
And she was maybe lonely in a way that reminded him of himself.

1276
01:39:27,728 --> 01:39:30,801
她失去了别的女孩儿不该失去的东西
She lost things that no girl had lost.

1277
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,060
她也知道一些她们不曾知道的事情
And she knew things.

1278
01:39:33,976 --> 01:39:35,377
她把这些教给他
And she taught him.

1279
01:39:35,942 --> 01:39:39,816
理查德觉得或许这就是所谓的友谊吧
And Richard thought maybe that was what friendship feels like.

1280
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,329
可能
Maybe.

1281
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:53,656
它转瞬即逝
It was just in the blinks.

1282
01:39:54,915 --> 01:39:57,029
实际上它还算不上开始
it barely began really.

1283
01:40:01,572 --> 01:40:04,414
但是在那漫长的冬天里
But in those long few winter days.

1284
01:40:05,323 --> 01:40:06,914
她已给他很多了
She gave him so much.

1285
01:40:08,978 --> 01:40:11,416
多到理查德可以由此获得新生
Enough so that Richard could go on.

1286
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:20,381
那么他又给了她什么呢?
And what did he give her?

1287
01:40:22,571 --> 01:40:24,968
只是一页写了字的纸
Just a few words on a page.

1288
01:40:26,663 --> 01:40:28,336
或许不多
Not much, perhaps.

1289
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,435
但是对于艾比
But for Abby.

1290
01:40:33,124 --> 01:40:34,902
他希望这就够了
He hoped that was enough.

1291
01:41:19,036 --> 01:41:20,279
嗯
Okay.
