- The pictures didn't
do it justice.

26
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,911
- Oh.

27
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,877
- l sense danger.
- It's fine.

28
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:50,962
l'm fine.

29
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,213
- Were you carsick?

30
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,965
- Of course not
Of course l wasn't carsick.

31
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,174
That's—

32
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,926
- Richard, l'm not sure
you fully understand

33
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,302
what you're walking into here.

34
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,639
There are countless unknowns.

35
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,307
- l can handle this, okay?

36
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:04,267
Please, just give me
some credit

37
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,393
- There's gonna be crying.

38
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,813
- l'm having trouble believing
how great this is.

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,777
You comin'?

40
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,154
Whoa!
Good Lord.

41
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,072
Claire.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,158
- Oh, poor thing.

43
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,450
Well, at least it was quick.

44
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,287
lt's a clean thoracic tear.

45
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,919
- We should give him
a proper buriaI.

46
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,892
l feel like l just lost
my bearings.

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,896
- Oh, thanks.

48
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,192
- Yeah.

49
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,082
Oh, this is charming.

50
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,545
Oh, the water works.

51
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,255
Good.

52
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,008
l don't know if the stove works.

53
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,302
Maybe they have take-out menus.

54
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,553
- Ah, listen!

55
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,473
Come here, come here, come here.

56
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,433
There she is, the mighty sea.

57
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,143
Still in there.

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,144
- Wow.

59
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,562
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,898
- That's so—that's—

61
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:34,899
l'm gonna look around.

62
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,406
- Oh, they've got plenty
of toweIs.

63
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,075
We didn't need to bring any.

64
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,244
Oh, well.

65
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,373
The fuse box is in
the linen closet, Richard.

66
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,713
Oh, there's a skylight

67
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,924
Richard?

68
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,598
- The couch

69
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,976
could be a problem.

70
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,519
- Don't fixate.

71
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,396
- You're right

72
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,855
Wonderful, everything.

73
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,148
- Good, that's right

74
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,318
You want to grab the luggage
out of the car?

75
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,739
l'll do it

76
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,201
- Phil Turley
is very concerned, Claire,

77
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,496
about the community's efforts
to protect the nesting grounds

78
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,206
of the native tern.

79
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,835
As he should be.

80
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,336
- Listen, l put all
my numbers

81
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,505
on the top sheet
of that memo pad by the phone,

82
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,550
so if you want to tear that off
and tape it up somewhere.

83
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,011
l'm in surgery from 9:00
tiII noon.

84
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,013
So l'll check in after that,
okay?

85
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,639
- Great, good.

86
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,687
- Are you sure you don't want
to rent a car?

87
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,314
- Didn't they say there was
a bike?

88
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,398
l'll dig it out of the garage.

89
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,399
lt's ten minutes to town.

90
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,151
This will be ideal.

91
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,694
- Okay, it's up to you.

92
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,536
- So what does your schedule
Iook Iike for tomorrow?

93
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,788
- I'II start
at the very beginning.

94
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,457
That's a very good place
to start.

95
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,000
- Speaking of which...

96
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,753
Close your eyes.

97
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,304
Okay, you can open them.

98
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,807
- Oh.

99
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,100
- Mark just got one of these.

100
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,560
He said a five-year-old
couId use it

101
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,312
- Richard, use your words.

102
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,648
- ActuaIIy, I was thinking
of writing on the Corona.

103
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,400
- Oh.

104
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,943
- No, but this is good.

105
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,236
No, this is—
you're right

106
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,448
This is better.

107
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,657
- Yeah.

108
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,868
Okay.

109
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,374
- Richard.

110
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,167
These fabrics.

111
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,186
- Oh, l talked to Peter
and Lucy,

112
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,522
and they said they might come
out the weekend of the 2nd.

113
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,232
- Great, great

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,734
Who?

115
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,319
- Peter and Lucy?

116
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,320
- Oh, good, yeah.

117
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,655
They're always fun.

118
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,825
- Yeah, yeah.

119
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,326
You didn't bring—

120
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,997
you didn't bring him out here,
did you?

121
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,124
- What?
No.

122
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,959
No, of course not

123
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,796
- No. Okay.

124
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,423
All right

125
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,263
Have a productive week, okay?

126
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,978
- Save some lives!

127
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,725
ding!

128
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,938
beep!

129
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,425
- Hot wheels.

130
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,426
- Let go of me.

131
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,928
- Do you remember the time

132
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,347
that you ran over the neighbor's
guinea pig, Little Fluff?

133
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,348
- No, l do not

134
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,682
Now will you let me go?

135
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,684
- Look, we both know that you're
not equipped to deal

136
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,144
with your current circumstances.

137
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,813
And untiI you prove otherwise,
l feel compelled to be on hand.

138
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,649
- Could you step aside?
l have things to do.

139
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,734
- l sense danger.

140
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,236
- Would you stop saying that?

141
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,414
- Be careful!

The squeaks drive me nuts.

159
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,824
lt's a nice bike, though.

160
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,120
l used to have one of these
when I was your age.

161
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,422
So how come you're following me?

163
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,049

How come?

167
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,639
- Well, l was just—
l kind of—

l thought maybe you might know
somebody who—

172
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,943
- Yeah, okay.

173
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,236
When do you need me for?

174
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,948

Merton regarded his solitude
as something s—

187
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:27,908

00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,201
You can't live without me.

189
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,202

190
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,620
l'm communing with nature here.

191
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,872
Why are you so incapable
of believing

192
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,833
l can do things perfectly fine
on my own?

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,543
- Because you never have.

194
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,544

How many times, huh?

197
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,923
Huh?
How many times?

198
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,925
"l'm gonna go through these
baIIet Iessons aIone."

199
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,468
- Do not mock me.

200
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,096
- "I'm gonna, Iike, go through
the college years, like, alone."

201
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,305
- Okay, that—

202
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,765

Captain.

203
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,934
l'm gonna resuscitate
my half-dead marriage alone."

204
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,143
- Zip it
You kindly zip it

205
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,812
- Please, for once in your life,
go it alone.

206
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,480
- GIadIy!
Good day, sir.

207
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,023
- A good day.

208
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,025
- You just don't like it
because l'm on an upswing.

209
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,652
- Oh, my God.

210
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,205
- Merton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

211
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,249
Merton?

212
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,625
Burton.

213
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,502
Milton?
MiIton.

215
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,097
- Hey.

216
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,474
Sorry, l'm a little early.

217
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,475

00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,895
l'm sorry, l forgot your name.

219
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,271
- Oh, that's okay.

220
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,272
l forgot yours too,

221
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,442
but l was thinking
that it was Paul

222
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,361
or Steve or Dave, maybe?

223
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,362

224
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,363

lt's a Love-A-Lot for the kid.

228
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,135
- Oh, well...

229
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,512
Actually—

230
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,723
- Um, so you just moved here?

231
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,224
Where from?

232
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,061
- Just the city.

233
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,062
- Oh.

234
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,897
- Yeah, it's only temporary.

235
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,650
My wife Claire is at New York
Presbyterian.

236
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,318
She's a vascular surgeon.

237
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,487

She's cute.

240
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,867
- Oh, yeah, that's the doctor.

241
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,244
- My parents went through
a trial separation once too.

242
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,496
- What?
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

243
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,830
That's not what's happening
here.

244
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,831
No, that's—
no.

245
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,334
That's—

246
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,794
l don't—is it?

247
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,672
- Well, you should probably
find out

248
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,673
- Huh.

249
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,635
- ls it sleeping, the baby?

250
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,179
- The thing about that baby is—

251
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,430
are you thirsty?

252
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,099
- Um, no.

253
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,184
- Oh, look.

254
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,063
The baby is not here.

255
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,064
- What do you mean?

256
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,026
- Basically, l guess,

257
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,487
there is no baby...

258
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,364
as such.

259
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,116
- There's no kid?

260
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,244
- Nope.

261
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,998
- Well, shit

262
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,666

five minutes.

as odd somehow?

328

A babysitter?

329
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,155
- l'm under a lot of pressure,
okay, to produce.

330
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,616
People expect literature:

332
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:26,993

00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,787
three months to crack
this thing.

334
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,122
- And the girl helps how?

335
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,416
- Was l popular in high school,
in retrospect?

336
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,210
- And the girl helps how?

337
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,004
- Do you have to question
every decision I make?

338
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,506
- Make better decisions.

339
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:40,799
- Just do the voice.

340
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,635
- Oh.

341
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,720
Oh, now he needs me.

342
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,180
- At this juncture, yes.

343
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,890
- Juncture?
- Yes.

344
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,684
- Oh.
- Yes, just do it

345
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,034
When the world is in peril,

346
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:12,414
when evil surrounds you,

347
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,375
when danger is lurking,

348
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,793
who do you call?

349
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:23,008
Captain Excellent!

350
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,971
- l'm bolstered!

351
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,492
There's something out there
in the woods.

352
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,661
- Oh, my God.

353
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,538
The wolf.
Didn't you hear?

354
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,415
lt escaped from the zoo
this morning.

355
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,292
- There's a zoo here?

356
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,462
No, l'm just—

357
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05,133
WeII, whatever it is,
l won't let it get you.

358
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,219
Come on, there's soup.

359
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,263
- What?

360
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,723
- Yeah, l made soup.

361
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,309
l thought that you might
be cold.

362
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,151
What did you do tonight?

363
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,236
- l went to the shore,
did some thinking.

364
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,408
- Oh, for three hours
in the freezing cold?

365
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,202
- You made this?

366
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,203
- Yeah.

367
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,329
- How?

368
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,499
- l don't know.

369
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,209
A couple of carrots,

370
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,879
an onion, one of your beers.

371
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,214
Oh, l hope that's okay.

372
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,508
l just kind of helped myself.

373
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,801
- No, it's fantastic.

374
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,054
- Oh, well, you haven't even
tasted it yet

375
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:54,849
- No, no, no, l mean,
the fact of it is fantastic,

376
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,310
that you made something
from nothing.

377
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,646
- Oh, you can, you know,

378
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,232
kind of make soup
out of anything.

379
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,527
That's the great thing about it

380
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,570
Just whatever's Ieft
laying around, you know.

381
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,240
You can take all the crap

382
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,076
that's rotting in your fridge
and throw out,

383
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:16,079
or you could toss it into a pot
and make soup out of it

384
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,498
So l go with soup.

385
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,960
Oh.

386
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,878
lt's superb.

387
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,382
- Thank you.

388
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,592
- No, really.

389
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,636
lt's excellent

390
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,596
- Do you remember the moment
when you reaIized

391
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,598
that soup didn't have
to come out of a can,

392
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,767
you know, like all manufactured,

393
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,185
that your chicken noodle
couId kick

394
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,604
Campbell's chicken noodle's ass
any day of the week?

395
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,274
- I think I'm having
that moment right now.

396
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,987
Plus, it's very nutritious,

397
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:53,116
which is good.

398
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,919
- What—what happened there?

399
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,254
- Oh.

400
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,423
Sorry.

401
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,842
It's just—
it's a boyfriend thing.

402
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,511
Just, um,

403
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,974
the bird kind of reminded me
of him.

404
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,642
He's chickenshit

405
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,686
- Oh.

406
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,188
Actually, it's not a chicken.

407
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,814
lt's the North American
heath hen.

408
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,691
Related to the greater
prairie chicken,

409
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,359
but not technically a chicken.

410
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,360
- Oh.

411
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,695
- lt's extinct now.

412
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,697
The last few lived out here

413
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,699
out on the nature preserve
at Camp Hero.

414
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,326
- Hmm.

415
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,536
l did not know that

416
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,038
- l'm not a birder or anything.

417
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,707
lt's just, the last surviving
heath hen

418
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,668
is a character in...

419
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:47,837
- ln what?

420
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,005
- That bird's just—

421
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,590
it's the main character of this
book that,

422
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:54,886
you know, l'm attempting
to produce, to write,

423
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,888
finish.

424
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:03,228
Actually, to start.

425
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,649
Saying it out loud just sounded
kind of stupid.

426
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,903
-Well, there's Chicken Little,

427
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,988
you know, and Little Red Hen.

428
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,240
- Henny Penny.

429
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,699
- Yeah, exactly.

430
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,743
Exactly.

431
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,620
Oh, you know, there's a lot
of books out there

432
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:25,208
about poultry.

433
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,382
- We should settle up.

434
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,552
- Okay.

435
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,598
- ls that about right?

436
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,768
- Actually, l'm $12 an hour.

437
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,897
- Oh, okay.

438
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:48,898
l only have a $10.

439
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,108
Do you have change?

440
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,611
- Let me check.

441
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,281
- So how come your boyfriend's
a chickenshit?

442
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:58,658
None of my business.

443
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,786
Sorry.

444
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,998
- No, he just—

445
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,583
He just bugs.

446
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,794
You know, it's like when he's
with me, it's all,

447
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,421
"Oh, you know."

448
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,132
And when he's with his friends,
he's all, "Ugh, whatever."

449
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,301
lt's just—you know,
he's a fucking chickenshit

450
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,221
- Right

451
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,349
- Okay, so thank you.

452
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,350
- Mmm-hmm.

453
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,478
Thank you.

454
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,695
Can l ask you a quick question?

455
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,196
- Sure.

456
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,659
- Does this couch
make me look fat?

457
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,662
- l wouldn't sit there.

458
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,747
- Hmm.

459
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,165
- So okay.

460
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,501
Good luck with the chicken book.

461
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,592
- Same time next week?

462
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,389
- Um...

463
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,308
Okay.

464
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:09,354
- You didn't tell me your name.

465
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,784
- Richard?

466
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,328
Richard.

467
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,210
- Are we separated?

468
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,628
- What?

469
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,547
- ls this a trial separation,
what we're doing?

470
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,508
- What makes you think that?

471
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,968
- l don't know.

472
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,347
Our separateness.

473
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,682
- Sweetie,
if we were separating,

474
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,392
you'd be the first to know.

475
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,644
- l guess.

476
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,604
- Well, we would have
discussed it

477
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,233
Trust me.

478
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,652
- Okay.

479
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,738
Whew, good.

480
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,286
lt just moved.

481
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,081
- Well, that's not possible.

482
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,625
lt's been boiled to death.

483
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,253
- Poor little Louie.

484
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,880
- Well, don't name it, Richard.

485
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,257
l mean, do whatever you want

486
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,759
No, don't—
don't name your food.

487
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,261
Here.

488
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:25,388
- Oh.

489
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,604
- There.
Okay?

490
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,487
Hmm?

491
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,489
There you go.

492
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,575
Hmm?

493
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,119
- lf only everything
in the world

494
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,371
could be covered in butter.

495
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,790
What a world that would be.

496
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,417
- l guess.

497
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,719
- What a buttery world.

498
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,233
- He any good?

499
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,234
- l don't know.

500
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,070
lt's kind of wordy.

501
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,157
- So what does
the renderer render?

502
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,534
- l haven't gotten
to that part yet

503
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,286
- Well, let me know.

504
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,079
l'm sure it's something
briIIiant

505
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,833
- What were you doing
in my gym class?

506
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:36,876
- Nothing.

507
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,628
- You think l didn't see you?

508
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,505
- l was just there
for moral support.

509
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,131
- l suck at volleyball.

510
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,341
- You do not

511
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,801
- l suck at everything.

512
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,470
No, you don't

513
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,722
You're fantastic
across the board.

514
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:55,520
- Would you just shut up?

515
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,521
- We never go out anymore.

516
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,190
- Look, you got to leave, okay?

517
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,318
l'm meeting Bryce later.

518
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,323
- He's beneath you, you know.

519
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,173
- Why you got to wear
so much shit?

520
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,758
- 'Cause it's freezing in here.

521
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,343
Run the heater.

522
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,221
- You want to pay for the gas?

523
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,855
- Are you done?

524
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,941
Yeah.

525
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,931
See you later.

526
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,953
- Okay.

527
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:36,954
- Well, just go for it

528
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,665
- l—l—
l'm going.

529
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,795
Okay, well, he's dead now.

530
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,796
Why don't you go?

531
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,423
Damn it
lt's your turn.

532
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,799
l don't know how you do this
all day.

533
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,301
l mean, there's so much
pressure.

534
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,385
- Well, it's just a game.

535
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,304
- l know.
- No one's dying here.

536
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,305
- Go ahead.

537
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,431
- We can play something else.

538
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,974
- No, it's fine.
lt's—you know.

539
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,684
- All right

540
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,812
Let's see.

541
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,161
That one's on my side.

542
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,245
- Yeah.

543
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,372
Well, that was fun.

544
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,373
- Yes, it was.

545
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
- Fun-packed weekend.

546
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,210
- Okay, weII,
have a productive week.

547
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,836
And l'll see you on the 15th.

548
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:26,837
- Yeah.

549
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,399
What?

550
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,487
You're standing.

551
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,614
Oh.

552
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:57,868
Really?

553
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:09,005
That's enough of that

554
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,923
You remember when you stuck
that dime up your nose

555
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,551
and tried to snort it
out your mouth?

556
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,053
The cowboy outfit for your
seventh grade school picture?

557
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,638
You remember?

558
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,224
The horny toads,
the hunger strike?

559
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,143
l cautioned you against
those decisions,

560
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,394
but you didn't listen to me,

561
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,062
which is fine,
'cause you were just a kid.

562
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,982
But now it's grow-up time.

563
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,608
The babysitter?

564
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,693
Bad, Richard.

565
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,238
Very, very bad, Richard.

566
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,990
That chair's gonna be a problem.

567
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:39,910
- Sakes alive.

568
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,496
- "Making the monkey.

569
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:47,376
"A humorous monkey is popular
in zooIogicaI gardens.

570
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:51,088
"For exampIe, it is IoveIy
that you make a baby monkey

571
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:56,635
"with small paper and that you
put it on a mother monkey.

572
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:11,233
Fold A, top right corner."

573
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,944
- Why origami?

574
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,654
Why now?

575
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,782
- l needed something to do
with my hands.

576
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,867
- l'm having trouble telling
which is the monkey

577
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,619
and which is the swan.

578
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,339
- Oh, that can't be all of them.

579
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,883
- No, no, there's a bunch more
in the truck.

580
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:36,884
- Oh, great

581
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,012
Start bringing them in.

582
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,565
Horton r—

583
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,241
- Richard, Richard,

584
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,951
for the Iove of God,
don't do this please.

585
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,952
Listen to me.

586
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,121
You're making a huge mistake.

587
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,581
You're going for it

588
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,087
- lt's Abby.

589
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,630
My name.

590
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,646
Oh, you got rid of the couch.

591
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,106
- Yeah, the couch was a problem.

592
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,360
Um...

593
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,195
This is for you.

594
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,530
- Oh.

595
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,116
lt's...

596
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,452
it's a fish.

597
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,454
A dead fish.

598
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,415
A whole dead fish.

599
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,541
- Yeah.

600
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,086
My dad fishes, like,
for a living.

601
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,087
lt's a fluke.

602
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,964
- ln what sense?

603
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,757
- lt's called a fluke.

604
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,343
lt's—the water around here
is swimming with them.

605
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,344
- Ah, yeah.

606
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,345
So it's edible?

607
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,932
- Yeah.

608
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,933
- A fluke.

609
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,768
That's great

610
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,896
Thanks.

611
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:18,194
- So l read that book you wrote.

612
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,529
l hope that's okay.

613
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,615
- Reading my book?

614
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,616
Of course.

615
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,744
You may be one of the few.

616
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,329
- So are you going out tonight?

617
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,331
Out on the town?

618
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,707
- Uh, l don't know.

619
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,835
What do the people of Montauk
do on a Friday night?

620
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,462
- The Yardarm's totally dead.

621
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,465
So you'd probably like that

622
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,175
lt's down by the harbor.

623
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:42,426
You can't miss it

624
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:46,931
- What did you think
of the book?

625
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:47,932
- l don't know.

626
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:48,974
What did you think of it?

627
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,309
- Me?
Oh, l—

628
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,855
you know,
it's got its strengths,

629
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,233
got its moments.

630
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:00,236
l hate it

631
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,201
- You should probably
put that fish in the fridge,

632
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,662
'cause it'll stink up
the whole house.

633
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,413
Trust me.
I know.

634
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,262
What?

635
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:28,764
- Soup ingredients.

636
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,557
You know, if you feel like it

637
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,396
- You bought me a rutabaga.

638
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,567
- You're making this
too easy on me.

639
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,611
- Well, like l said, you know,
if you feel like it

640
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,948
No pressure.

641
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,041
- Your book was cool, actually.

642
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,588
lt kind of blew me away.

643
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,989
- You planning on having
something to eat?

644
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,157
- Thanks, no.

645
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:32,036
homemade.

646
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,662
- Can't beat that

647
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,663
Another beer?

648
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,790
- Sure.

649
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:49,553
- So what brings you down
to the South Shore, then?

650
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,554
- A book.

651
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,805
A bird.

652
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,058
A book about a bird.

653
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:58,520
Research work, you know.

654
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,648
- My wife makes
a good chowder.

655
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,152
Not so much a clam chowder
Iike you'd expect,

656
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,489
more of a corn chowder.

657
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,952
- My Lorraine, she can shuck
a dozen oysters

658
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,371
in a minute and a half.

659
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,914
- Local Malpeque oyster?

660
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,374
- That's the one.

661
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,044
- My wife invented and patented
a Iifesaving poIymer shunt

662
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,214
- Shunt, you say?

663
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,383
- Shunt

664
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,852
So there's our heath hen,

665
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,979
hunkered down at Camp Hero.

666
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:41,980
- Just down the road here?

667
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,440
- Yep.
As game warden—

668
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,441
- The Alfred guy.

669
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,442
- Yeah, correct

670
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,486
Alfred is his actual name.

671
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,824
In the book, I am going
to call him Horton or Morton.

672
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,119
Anyway, so he's brought
his flock of heath hens

673
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,037
back from the brink
of extinction.

674
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,288
- Awesome.

675
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,916
- l mean, he was down to 11
of them.

676
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,293
11, you know, but now with care,
and dare I say, Iove,

677
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,294
and incubators,

678
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,672
he's got 200.

679
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,090
And it's like the hen is saved.

680
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,425
- Safe, thank God.

681
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,760
- But because our story
is a tragedy,

682
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,220
you know what happens?
- What?

683
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,555
- Fire.

684
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,722
- No!
- Come on!

685
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,224
- Oh, yeah,
it sweeps across the preserve.

686
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,642
Of course, the heath hen,

687
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,769
not nature's most intelligent
bird to begin with...

688
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:21,979
- l hear ya.

689
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,605
- She just sits in her nest

690
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,357
You know, and she doesn't have
the sense to run

691
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,526
or fly or waddle.

692
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,987
You know,
when the fire runs out,

693
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,573
there's just five birds
remaining.

694
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,367
- Roast chicken.

695
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,205
- What happens to the five?

696
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,875
- They dwindle.

697
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,669
They dwindle

698
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,173
till there's just one left,
you know?

699
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,382
Just one.

700
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,553
Just one poor stupid
little thing.

701
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,765
You know,
it's just a stupid bird.

702
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,643
Just one.

703
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:10,194
lt's a true story.

704
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,989
- Another round
for my friend here, Mike.

705
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,842
- Chicken shit

706
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,532
Oh, you did make soup.

707
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,991
Bless your heart.

708
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,118
Oh.

709
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,081
Mm, oh.

710
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,666
Such a small act of kindness,

711
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,378
but l can't tell you
what that means to me.

712
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,379
- Well, it's no big deal.

713
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:11,838
lt's just soup.

714
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:16,510
- You are such a beautiful girl.

715
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,429
You are such a beautiful child.

716
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,639
- You're loaded.

717
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,182
- No, no, no, l—

718
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,183
well, yes.

719
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,935
- Okay, l should go.

720
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,395
Since tonight
was a little longer—

721
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,896
- You know what l am?

722
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,566
Let me tell you what l am,
just in case you're interested.

723
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,942
This is what l am.

724
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,277
- What?

725
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,196
- l am the only child
of an only child

726
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,614
and an only child.

727
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:38,949
And you know what that means.

728
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,784
- No cousins?

729
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,745
- lt means l am the end
of a bloodline,

730
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,872
the last of my kind.

731
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,958
- Okay, well,
then have some kids.

732
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,920
Said the babysitter.

733
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:52,921
lf you only knew.

734
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:55,799
- Okay.

735
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,718
Look, it's gonna be 60 bucks.

736
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,928
Okay, you should go to bed.

737
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,306
- l don't blame her, the doctor.

738
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,892
You know, she's just—
she's a human mechanic.

739
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,813
You know, she's got her hands
inside human beings every day.

740
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,356
They're just machines to her,
you know.

741
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,734
They're machines that break,

742
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,236
like rot factories.

743
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,863
So how can you create life

744
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,448
when you know it's gonna
end up in death?

745
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,449
l mean, l get that

746
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:24,369
l get it!

747
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,829
l don't blame her, but—

748
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,374
- Hey, l'm sorry.

749
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,917
- Eh.

750
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:40,052
See, she doesn't realize
that human beings are warm.

751
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,720
You know, they need contact

752
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,513
They need, you know—

753
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,432
you are such a beautiful girl.

754
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,975
You are such a beautiful child.

755
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:47,976
thud!

756
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,187
No, no!

757
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,355
thud!

758
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,985
- Shit

759
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,948
- l'm gonna go.

760
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,376
Why are men such dicks?

761
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,044
- Beats me.

762
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,046
- l just thought he was lonely.

763
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,632
- We're all lonely.

764
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,716
- l don't know.

765
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,052
Maybe l shouldn't have hit him.

766
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,846
- No, you definitely
should have.

767
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,225
Okay, would you rather?

768
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,018
- l don't want to play.

769
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,438
- Oh, come on.

770
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,986
Would you rather

771
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,656
have no TV for a year

772
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,492
or onIy be abIe
to watch The Golf Channel?

773
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,287
- Golf Channel.

774
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,997
- Yeah, me too.

775
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:56,378
At least it's TV.

776
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:57,504
Your turn.

777
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,845
- Okay, would you rather have
no friends or no parents?

778
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,087
- Claire?

779
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,797
- Richard, the couch is outside.

780
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,841
- ls it the 15th already?

781
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,217
- Are you okay?

782
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,218
- Yes, l am.

783
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,262
- There's soup in the kitchen.

784
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,472
Have you been making soup?

785
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,599
- l'll be right back.

786
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:00,692
- All right

787
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,693
You made the soup.

788
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:02,861
What babysitter?

789
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,740
Work is going great,
and l'm still not here.

790
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:07,741
Drink it up.

791
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:08,742
There you go.

792
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,827
Now get out there.

793
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,168
- You know the funny thing
about soup?

794
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,545
You get the ingredients
basicaIIy into the pot

795
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,548
along with the sauce and the—
not the sauce.

796
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,133
The juice.

797
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,885
- You mean the broth?

798
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:31,765
- Right, right, and then
it just needs some cooking.

799
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,060
- Richard, is anything wrong?

800
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,436
l'm not—

801
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,771
l'm concerned.

802
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:42,067
- Oh, weII, thank you
for your concern, Claire.

803
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,944
Speaking of...
how are your patients?

804
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,904
Are they doing well?

805
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:50,826
And what are some
of their names?

806
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,121
- You know, you've got a bruise
right here.

807
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,207
- Oh, well, you know,
beaten down by life.

808
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,752
You know, winds of change.

809
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,712
Anyway, l want to do some
unIoading of boxes

810
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,090
if you want to pitch in.

811
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:08,468
Then we can grab some brunch.

812
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,723
- Oh, no, Richard, no.

813
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,724
Are these all—

814
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,018
- Oh, yes.

815
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,103
- Why?

816
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,771
Why would you do that
to yourseIf?

817
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,189
- Well, l just thought
as I embarked

818
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,649
on the writing of my second—

819
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,192
my much anticipated
second novel,

820
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,444
that l should be reminded
of the remarkable,

821
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,363
l mean, really
quite noteworthy failure

822
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:32,534
of my first noveI to seII
any copies whatsoever.

823
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,494
- Richard, l can't go
down this road with you.

824
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,747
- No, no, no, it's gonna be
very motivationaI, reaIIy.

825
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:54,598
- That was smooth.

826
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,640
- Hey, l got through it

827
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,142
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait

828
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,310
- What?

829
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,020
- My super senses
are telling me something.

830
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,354
- What?
- Yes.

831
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,356
I think the doctor
may be on to you.

832
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,482
- Oh, hush your mouth.

833
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,483
- Knock, knock.

834
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,484
Who's there?

835
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,324
- Shit

836
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,034
What do you want?

837
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,662
- I came to see
if you were okay,

838
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,663
'cause your head was—

839
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,664
- lt's fine.
I'm fine.

840
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,499
You need to go.

841
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,792
- What?

842
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,502
- You need to go now.

843
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,964
- Well, screw you too.

844
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,883
And you were the one
who came on to me,

845
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,885
by the way.

846
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,803
- What?

847
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,432
- Last night, asshole.

848
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,809
l was gonna apologize
for hitting you,

849
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,810
but forget it

850
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,521
You're a creep.

851
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,106
- Wait, Abby.

852
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:51,154
- The doctor's
out of her shower, FYl.

853
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,074
- Richard, who was that?

854
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:57,744
- Girl scout

855
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,537
- Oh, okay.

856
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,967
- Horton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

857
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,220
Horton, Norton,

858
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,014
Norwood.

859
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,058
Norwood regarded his solitude
as s—

860
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:33,446
- How's it coming?

861
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,664
- Norwood regarded his solitude
as some—

862
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,840
- Richard, what's this?

863
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:52,841
- lt's a fluke.

864
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:54,926
- ln what way?

865
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,302
- The fish.
lt's called a fluke.

866
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,221
The water around here
is swimming with them.

867
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,848
- Oh, okay.

868
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:01,433
What were you planning
on doing with it?

869
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,643
- Do l have to have a plan?

870
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,104
Can't l just have a fish
in the house?

871
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,522
- Yes, fine.
l'm sorry.

872
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,941
- l thought we could cook it
then eat it

873
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,192
How's that?

874
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,902
- l guess l just hadn't caught
up with the fact

875
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,031
that you're a cook now.

876
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,990
- Okay, stop.
Stop it

877
00:51:59,158 --> 00:51:59,991
You can stop.

878
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,284
Please stop now.

879
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,285
Stop it

880
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,578
Stop, stop, please!

881
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,080
Stop!

882
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:35,110
- Abby.

883
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:40,907
- Who the hell is that?

884
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,789
What the hell is she doing?

885
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,625
- l don't think l got a chance
to pay you the other night

886
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:51,626
How's $60?

887
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:52,627
- Keep it

888
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,337
You don't even
have a kid, so—

889
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,217
- l think there was kind of
a misunderstanding

890
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,845
about some of my actions
or intentions.

891
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,221
I'm pretty sure
l said some things.

892
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,722
- Whatever.

893
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,724
I'm sure you're sorry
that you said all that stuff.

894
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,935
- l'm not sorry, actually,
about all that

895
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,188
What l'm sorry about is that
l was so abrupt at the house.

896
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,189
lt was just—

897
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,190
- Your wife was there.

898
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,400
Yeah, l figured that out

899
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,776
- Yes, it would have been,
you know,

900
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:17,777
awkward, you know?

901
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,697
- No, actually, l don't know.

902
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:24,325
- Well, Claire wouldn't really
understand our...

903
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,995
- Our what?

904
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:30,373
- Uh...

905
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,292
our friendship.

906
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,673
- Abby.

907
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:39,674
Come on.

908
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,092
We're out of here.

909
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:45,221
- Anyway, l wanted to let
you know that l respect you.

910
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:50,185
And is that Chickenshit?

911
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,687
Yeah.

912
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:53,771
- He's a good-looking guy.

913
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,900
- Yeah, he sure thinks so.

914
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,693
- You coming or what?

915
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,778
We're going to Turner's house,
smoke a jay.

916
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:01,779
- Yeah, just a minute.

917
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,656
- l'm Richard.

918
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,617
- Look, you said you wanted
to hang out more.

919
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:06,743
You in or out?

920
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:07,869
- lt's okay, Abby.

921
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:11,539
l don't want to keep you
from your jay.

922
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:12,999
- Who's your friend
with the bike?

923
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,626
- Abby's been babysitting
for me.

924
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,212
How's Wednesday night?

925
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,006
- Sure.

926
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:25,136
- Damn, girl, move your ass.

927
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,808
- Sorry.

928
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,519
- What's wrong with you?

929
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,624
- Richard!

930
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,001
- Hello!

931
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,341
Don't you do it!

932
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,801
- Richard, are you here?

933
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:05,843
- Yeah, l'll be right there.

934
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,595
- Listen to me.

935
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,847
Hey, this won't end well.

936
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,521
Hey, how you doing?

937
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:17,522
- Come on.

938
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,648
l want to show you something.

939
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,483
- Great, okay.

940
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,743
l have a problem with my hands.

941
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,161
- What do you mean?

942
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,830
- They won't do
what l want them to do.

943
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,041
- What do you want them to do?

944
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,042
- Anything.

945
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,627
l don't know, something useful.

946
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,423
l want them to build something
or make something.

947
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,924
- Like what?

948
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,052
- Even Jesus, l mean,
he was a carpenter.

949
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,346
You know, it wasn't enough
for him to save mankind.

950
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,472
He needed a trade.

951
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,560
I'm a fIimsy man,
an insubstantial.

952
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,646
- Well, compared to Jesus.

953
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,691
- l'm a paper man.

954
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,901
- No, you're a writer.

955
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,653
- Yeah, that's crucial.

956
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:08,781
- No, it is.

957
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,077
Here we are.

958
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,748
- Where?

959
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,251
- "lt is possible
to be so at sea

960
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,754
"when life and land have
slipped under the horizon.

961
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,090
l quietly wish to never see
either again."

962
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,091
- Did l write that?

963
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,176
l wrote that

964
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,680
- Hold this.

965
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,440
- Abby?

966
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:50,740
Abby!

967
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,413
Come on.

968
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,414
Abby!

969
00:56:58,582 --> 00:56:59,415
Abby.

970
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,084
Abby!

971
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,802
Jesus, what are you doing?

972
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,261
What are you doing?

973
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,186
- Come here.

974
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:26,067
- You cannot do this.

975
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:27,985
You can't do that

976
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,881
- lt was me

977
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:54,887
that dared her
to go in.

978
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:59,308
lt was really cold.

979
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,561
It was much,
much colder than today.

980
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,690
But you know, she wasn't gonna
turn down a dare.

981
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,488
We were like that

982
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,365
And l had eaten 23 oysters.

983
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,366
- Hmm.

984
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,077
- So l don't know

985
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,664
why she went in
in her cIothes.

986
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,292
Um...

987
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,839
l guess maybe we thought
it wouId be warmer.

988
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,966
Kids.

989
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:42,685
And she was laughing,

990
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:47,732
and, you know, fine.

991
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:52,737
And then she was...

992
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,198
And then she was gone.

993
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:04,624
Just under and gone.

994
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:09,712
And l just stood there.

995
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,887
And then a couple hours later
my mom came

996
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,180
and found me.

997
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:22,725
And l guess, you know,

998
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,102
l was waiting for her
to swim back in.

999
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:30,942
But she never did.

1000
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,069
- How old?

1001
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,446
- Same age as me.

1002
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,532
We're twins.

1003
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,701
- Oh.

1004
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,246
Oh, my God.

1005
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,665
- That was a long time ago.

1006
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,793
l like to go out there
every year

1007
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:52,088
and swim back to shore.

1008
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,967
You know, l like to feel
the coId.

1009
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:00,888
- lt must have—

1010
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:05,393
l don't know what to say.

1011
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,896
- So we're both only children.

1012
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:28,874
- That was our thing every year,

1013
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,794
and you know it

1014
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:38,968
And you take that guy out there
on this day.

1015
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,387
He didn't even know her.

1016
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,847
- l know.

1017
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:47,059
- Remember when l was the only
one that wouId taIk to you

1018
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,811
for a long time?

1019
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,480
- l know, but—

1020
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,566
- He doesn't love you.

1021
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:56,444
lf that's what you think,
you're wrong.

1022
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,529
- What do you want me to say?

1023
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,699
- l could so move
to California.

1024
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:02,950
You shouldn't just assume

1025
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,369
l'll always be around,
'cause one day

1026
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,622
maybe l won't

1027
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,333
- Stop it

1028
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,461
- ls that what you want?

1029
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,928
- l don't have much of a story,
do I?

1030
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,639
- lt's all relative, l suppose.

1031
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,724
- Exactly.

1032
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,060
Other people seem
to have had events.

1033
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,394
Things have happened to them,

1034
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,563
life-altering occurrences.

1035
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,815
- l used to do things.

1036
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:35,941
Remember?

1037
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,234
- This isn't about you.

1038
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,987
- Amazing things.

1039
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,990
What do you want me to say?

1040
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,200
- l don't know.

1041
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:45,743
- No, no, no, no.

1042
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,953
Tell me what you want me to say,
IiteraIIy,

1043
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:54,460
'cause, frankly, at this point,
l got nothing.

1044
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,634
- But you have touched
several lives, Richard,

1045
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:02,635
through your work.

1046
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:03,803
lt's not about your happiness

1047
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,097
but the happiness you've brought
to others.

1048
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,610
- Hey, look,
it's the fund-raiser

1049
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,612
for the children's hospital
tomorrow night.

1050
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,907
And l was thinking of donating
that bottle of wine,

1051
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,410
the '71 Château Petrus.

1052
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,745
l know we were saving it
for a special occasion,

1053
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,872
but, well,
it's for a good cause.

1054
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,250
So what do you think?

1055
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,213
Richard, did you drink
that wine,

1056
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,216
that $5,000 bottle of wine?

1057
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,676
lt's not in the rack.

1058
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,302
lt was for the children.

1059
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,889
Will you call me, please?

1060
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,440
- Come in.

1061
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,195
- Whoa.

1062
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,072
Check out the couch.

1063
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,615
- You like?

1064
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,659
- l made it with these.

1065
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,161
- All right!

1066
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,162
That's awesome.

1067
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,790
- Yeah, sit
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

1068
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,625
- Uh!

1069
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,626
- Huh?

1070
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,422
- lt's nice.

1071
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,342
- Oh, those—
just ideas for titIes.

1072
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,635
- For your new book?

1073
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,012
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool, what have you got?

1074
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,766
- Uh...

1075
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:35,186
Cloudscape,

1076
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,063
Death and Desolation,

1077
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,064
The Daffodil.

1078
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,446
- Memoirs of an Amnesiac,

1079
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,489
Bolero.

1080
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,907
- Bolero?

1081
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,533
- Okay.

1082
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:50,868
Ad Nauseam,

1083
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,203
Balm of Silence.

1084
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,746
No?

1085
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,581
Old Miss Ptarmigan's
Blackberry Wine?

1086
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,582
- Whoa.

1087
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,917
- Let's forget it

1088
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,044
Titles are impossible.

1089
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,257
- Paper Man.

1090
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,408
- You seem a lot more
interesting than me.

1091
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,203
- l'm not

1092
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,539
It just seems that way
because l have a dead sister.

1093
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,000
- Where you been all day?

1094
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,168
- l don't know.

1095
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,170
- Whatever.

1096
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,755
So the party's off this weekend.

1097
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,257
Turner's mom busted him.

1098
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,719
- So what about the cove?

1099
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,180
- lt's fucking cold out there.

1100
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:54,181
- Big deal.

1101
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,182
So the party's off.

1102
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,517
- What kind of party?

1103
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,935
- What do mean
"What kind of party?"

1104
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,603
A fucking party.
- Just nothing.

1105
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:00,813
Just some friends hanging out

1106
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,273
- You could use my place.

1107
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,900
- What?

1108
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:05,901
- Seriously?

1109
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:06,902
- Yeah, why not?

1110
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,696
This weekend's not so good.

1111
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:09,864
My wife's back.

1112
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,615
But you know,
we could do next week.

1113
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:12,825
Friday?

1114
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,869
- Friday is cool.

1115
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:15,870
- Really?

1116
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,497
- Yeah, l'll get a keg.

1117
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,332
- Nice!
Nice.

1118
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,584
- What else do you guys need?

1119
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,044
Appetizers, you know,
paper plates and stuff?

1120
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,963
- No, no, no.

1121
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,298
We're okay.

1122
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,299
We've got it covered.

1123
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,551
- Great, we're on.

1124
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:31,719
- Righteous.

1125
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:32,845
Thanks, man.

1126
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,940
- You didn't have to do that

1127
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,026
- Ah, it'll be fun.

1128
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,999
- Richard!

1129
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,877
Richard?

1130
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,964
Richard, please.

1131
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:15,721
- Hi.

1132
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,682
When the world is in peril,

1133
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,894
when evil surrounds you,
when dange—

1134
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,021
Okay.

1135
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,694
- Richard, help me.

1136
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,112
- You don't like it?

1137
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,782
- All the furniture is outside.

1138
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:38,035
And what the hell is this?

1139
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,788
- You seem disappointed,
going off your body language.

1140
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:43,207
- You don't pick up the phone
once this week.

1141
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,709
You don't call me once.

1142
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:49,880
l drive all the way out here,
and there's this.

1143
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,257
Richard, say something.

1144
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,312
What's this?

1145
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,814
- What's what?

1146
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:08,440
- This.
Whose is this?

1147
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,526
- Will you just tell her?

1148
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,361
- Claire?

1149
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,239
- Yes?

1150
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:16,991
- Are we unhappy,

1151
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:20,911
or are we just pretending
to be unhappy?

1152
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,371
- What do you mean?

1153
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,999
- Are we just pretending
to be unhappy

1154
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,126
to add drama to our lives

1155
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:31,505
so that we seem somehow
more substantial?

1156
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,798
l mean, think about it

1157
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,883
Our lives
are embarrassingly easy.

1158
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,260
We've got plenty of money.

1159
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:37,386
We got friends.

1160
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,512
Well, you've got friends.

1161
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,180
There are people out there

1162

1168
01:07:56,948 --> 01:08:00,034
Doesn't it feel like

1169
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,785
our unhappiness?

We're not 23 anymore.

1176
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:28,729
You need to pull it together.

1177
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:30,439
Pick up the phone this week.

1178
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:37,446
And bring the fucking furniture

- No, you're starting too high.

1196
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,967
You need to go down at the base
of the chin.

1197
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:22,968
- Oh.

1198

Okay, would you rather
always walk backwards

1207
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,996
or stub your toe every time

1208

01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,618
- Chickenshit

1329
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,162
- What did you call me?

1330
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,246
- Chickenshit bastard.

1331
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:51,458
- You don't talk to me
like that

1332
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:52,751
Who the hell are you?

1333
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,169
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1334
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:57,255
You don't talk to me like that,
you fucking freak.

1335
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,132
- You think you can threaten me?
You're a chiId.

1336
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,885
- l'm a child, huh?

1337
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:03,053

1338
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,096
- Bryce, get the fuck

1339
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,390
What are you doing?
Stop it

1340
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:08,725
Are you okay?

1341
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,310
- What's the deaI?
What's the deal here?

1342
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:12,896
You fucking him?
- Stop it, Bryce.

1343
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:13,938
- SeriousIy,

1344
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:14,939
- No.

1345
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,358
- l don't give a shit

1346
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:17,359
He can have her.

1347
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,402
She's fucking crazy anyway.

1348
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,071
Why don't you go back
to the Iooney bin

1349
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,405
where you belong?

1350
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:23,865
And take him with you.

1351
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,326
- Get the fuck out

1352
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:27,827

1355
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,293
What the fuck are you

1356
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,796
Get out of here.
Party's over.

1357
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:47,055
- Chickenshit is an asshole.

1358
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:49,182
- Yeah.

1359
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:55,188
- Great party.

1360
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,315
- Yeah.

1361
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:06,741
- l love you.

1362
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,912
- What?

1363
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:17,877
- Not in any inappropriate way,

1364
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:23,508
nothing that's not,
you know, decent or—

1365
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:28,888
l just find when l examine
my heart

1366
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:35,019
l find...

1367
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:39,190
l think that there's love
there...

1368
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:44,070
For you.

1369
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:46,197
Yeah.

1370
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,078
l love you.

1371
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:04,215
- lt was...

1372
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,384
lt wasn't really a looney bin.

1373
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:09,888
lt was...

1374
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:15,351
l mean, l was only there
for a coupIe months,

1375
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:21,441
you know, just untiI I...

1376
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:27,197
My parents thought..

1377
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,408
l don't know.

1378
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:36,039
l never told them.

1379
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:43,421
l never told anyone.

1380
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,051
lt was a pact

1381
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:59,145
Me and Amy

1382
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:03,399
were both supposed to go

1383
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:07,028
into the water,
and she did it

1384
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:13,034
And l swam back.

1385
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:23,586
l swam back.

1386
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:28,258
l couldn't—

1387
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,808
l don't know what we were
so unhappy about

1388
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:41,646
l mean...

1389
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:46,568
what could we have been
so unhappy about?

1390
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,695
Eight

1391
01:21:53,868 --> 01:22:00,081
l guess you're too young to know
that you can get over anything.

1392
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:45,335
- He's always made
poor decisions.

1393
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:48,922
- Same with her.

1394
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,090
- You feel helpless.

1395
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,847
How long you been with her?

1396
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,641
- Since she was eight

1397
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:00,642
You?

1398
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,478
- Oh, Christ

1399
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:06,230
That's got to be over 40 years.

1400
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,860
Second grade.

1401
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:12,946
- lsn't he a little old for you?

1402
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:16,282
- l keep telling him that

1403
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,493
He never listens.

1404
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,036
- They never do.

1405
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:22,372
- No.

1406
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:25,875
- What's your gig?

1407
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,086
- l've pretty much done it all.

1408
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:34,217
Battled monsters under the bed,
been a cheerIeader,

1409
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:38,388
confidant

1410
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,556
These days, it's a bit of a
mystery, to tell you the truth.

1411
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:41,557
You?

1412
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,601
- l'm crazy in love with her.

1413
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:47,188
Tough one.

1414
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,732
- Yeah.

1415
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,610
lt's been all right

1416
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:53,945
l think she's almost done
with me.

1417
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:56,572
- Good.

1418
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,573
Great

1419
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,952
Get out while you can.

1420
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,581
l tell you, they open the door,
you run.

1421
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:08,960
You don't want to end up
Iike me.

1422
01:24:09,128 --> 01:24:11,087
- Guess not

1423
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:16,134
- Captain Excellent

1424
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,138
- Christopher.

1425
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:23,558
Nice to meet you.

1426
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,560
- See you around.

1427
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,355
- Oh.

1428
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,571
- What? What?
What? What?

1429
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,782
- You son of a bitch!

1430
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,617
You son of a bitch!

1431
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:23,910
- Don't overreact here.

1432
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,411
- Shut up.

1433
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:27,246
Don't tell me how to react
- lt's not like that

1434
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,999
- Shut up!

1435
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,667
What is this, Richard?

1436
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:32,835
What—
who is that?

1437
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,253
Who the fuck is that?

1438
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,047
- She's the babysitter.

1439
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,008
- Get out

1440
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:40,051
Get out

1441
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:41,803
Get out!

1442
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,473
- Hi, Lucy.

1443
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,517
Hi, Peter.

1444
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,602
- Hi.

1445
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,271
Claire, we'll just be—

1446
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,274
- l didn't sleep
with the babysitter,

1447
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,526
if that's what you're thinking.

1448
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,736
- Oh, that's so comforting.

1449
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:00,279
Why do we even have
a babysitter?

1450
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,698
- lt's just a kegger, Claire.

1451
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:03,825
That's all.

1452
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,159
- Just a kegger?

1453
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,745
And with whom exactIy
did you have a kegger?

1454
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:09,288
- Just some kids
from the high school.

1455
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:10,790
- Richard, just stop.

1456
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,125
None of this is okay.

1457
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,251
- Okay.

1458
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,461
- You knew we were
coming this weekend.

1459
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,963
Why are you doing this?

1460
01:26:17,131 --> 01:26:19,674
- l've been at a bit of a loss.

1461
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,050
- That's a bullshit answer.

1462
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,593
- l've been floundering,

1463
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:23,970
and Abby has been—

1464
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:25,888
- What?
Abby's been what?

1465
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:27,515
- A friend.

1466
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:28,683
- For God's sake.

1467
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:30,101
That's not a friend;
that's a child.

1468
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,103
You have friends.
- No, l don't

1469
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:35,022
- Do think that was a chipmunk
that we hit?

1470
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,400
- l think they hibernate.
- Yeah.

1471
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,278
- 'Cause you don't know how
to relate to other human beings.

1472
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,155
Yeah, you isolate yourself.

1473
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:43,364
- Oh, you could talk.

1474
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:44,490
- What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

1475
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:45,992
- You can be cold, Claire.

1476
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,078
- Let's just maybe
get out of here.

1477
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:51,038
Can we just get out of here?
Can we Ieave this area?

1478
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,874
- What do you mean by that?

1479
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,918
- l don't know
if it's your profession or what

1480
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:59,380
But it's made you hard.

1481
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,673
- l can't—
l don't accept that

1482
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,341
- l wanted to have a baby.

1483
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,761
- Is that what
this is all about?

1484
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,555
- We could have had a baby,
CIaire.

1485
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:09,182
Why didn't we have a baby?

1486
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,142
- Why?
Because you are a baby!

1487
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,977
You're an infant

1488
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,313
You still have
an imaginary friend.

1489
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,065
- l just wanted
a little warm thing,

1490
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,151
something simple
I couId start with,

1491
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:24,238
a single relationship with
a person that was new and pure,

1492
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:25,823
where I couId be me
and they could be them,

1493
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,575
and that was aII
that was expected.

1494
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:29,327
And we could build this world

1495
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,163
where there was someone else
other than me

1496
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:34,624
to think about and be about,

1497
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:40,755
the relief of being able to give
the worId to someone eIse

1498
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,924
and just let it be theirs,

1499
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,885
let them have their turn,

1500
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,054
so it doesn't end with me.

1501
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,724
- Well, that's all you.

1502
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,142
Where do l come in?

1503
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,435
- What do you mean?

1504
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:57,271
God, you're the mother.

1505
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:01,984
- Uh, l'm so sorry, you guys.

1506
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:03,611
But we're gonna go.

1507
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:04,862
We're just gonna go.

1508
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,822
- B&B just anywhere?

1509
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:07,823
Anywhere.

1510
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,575
- l'm sorry.

1511
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,118
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1512
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,912
- We're just gonna—
- Okay, l'll walk you out

1513
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,664
- We should all go on a cruise
or something.

1514
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,461
- Okay.

1515
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,680
- Take care.

1516
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:52,034
- All right, if we're gonna do
this, let's—

1517
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:54,996
all right, by the way,
what is she, like, 13, 14?

1518
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,331
Let's at Ieast get
our facts straight, though.

1519
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,542
Okay, it was you, Richard.

1520
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,127
You didn't want to have a baby.

1521
01:29:01,295 --> 01:29:02,253
You weren't ready.

1522
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:04,839
So that little fuzzy
fucking speech

1523
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:07,633
my friends had to hear
was bullshit

1524
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:10,720
And now l'm—
l can't

1525
01:29:12,973 --> 01:29:15,850
So l guess l'm the bad guy.

1526
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,187
- No, not the novel.

1527
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,273
Look, l'd rather you didn't—

1528
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:23,274
- What is this?

1529
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:25,568
What is this?

1530
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:27,028
- That's it

1531
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:29,739
- After all this time out here,

1532
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:30,948
this is it?

1533
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,533
This?

1534
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,785
Maybe if you'd spent
more time working

1535
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,829
instead of fucking
the babysitter—

1536
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,205
- No.

1537
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,957
- You're useless.
- Yes.

1538
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:40,958
- You're totally useless.

1539
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,501
- Yes, l am.

1540
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,836
- What is wrong with you?

1541
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:49,467
- l don't know what to do
with my hands!

1542
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:02,313
Jen and my sister
and Liv all envied me.

1543
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,899
l had the one who made me laugh.

1544
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:05,900
What happened?

1545
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,194
l don't know what happened.

1546
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:10,404
- You stopped laughing.

1547
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:15,970
- Help you?

1548
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:18,889
- Yeah, l came to pay
my respects.

1549
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:20,099
- Sorry?

1550
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:22,017
- The heath hen,
the North American heath hen.

1551
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,478
This is where
the last one lived, died.

1552
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:26,147
- Oh.

1553
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,275
l wouldn't know anything
about a heath hen.

1554
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:31,277
But you're welcome
to Iook around.

1555
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,529
We've got several varieties
of pIover.

1556
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,323
- Thank you.

1557
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,267
So this is what the end
of something looks like.

1558
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,186
- The world went on, Richard.

1559
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:06,479
- But never the same.

1560
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:08,147
Who knows how she might have
changed things

1561
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:11,442
with herjust being here,
the rippIe effect

1562
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:12,902
- And if that chicken
hadn't died out,

1563
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,403
you'd be perfectly
well adjusted.

1564
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:15,404
- Maybe.

1565
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:18,824
- Doubtful.

1566
01:32:18,992 --> 01:32:20,868
- Instead,
l'm a childless loser.

1567
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,579
l'm condemned to oblivion,
Captain,

1568
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:25,331
just Iike our IittIe hen.

1569
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:32,838
lt's time for you to go.

1570
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,674
- No.

1571
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:39,345
- You know what l'm saying,
Captain.

1572
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:46,644
I mean,
go and never come back.

1573
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:49,605
- l'm not ready.

1574
01:32:49,773 --> 01:32:50,898
- lt doesn't matter.

1575
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:56,028
You can't help me anymore.

1576
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:58,030
The doctor's right

1577
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,740
- But you'll be all alone.

1578
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:01,951
- Yes.

1579
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,078
Last of my kind.

1580
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:14,463
Okay.

1581
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:17,174
Do the voice

1582
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:19,218
one last time.

1583
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:25,683
Please.

1584
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,942
- When the world is in peril,

1585
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:39,655
when evil surrounds you,

1586
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:42,366
when danger is lurking...

1587
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:49,331
Who do you call?

1588
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:54,003
- Captain Excellent

1589
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:31,225
- I wish I had
a really amazing

1590
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:34,520
fucked-up father like him.

1591
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,133
- Captain.

1592
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,269
Richmond regarded his solitude—

1593
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:17,604
Merton regarded—
Horton regarded—

1594
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:29,867
Richmond?

1595
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:32,286
Richmond?

1596
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:43,088
Richard.

1597
01:36:54,309 --> 01:37:00,814
Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

1598
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:41,814
- l had this dream last night

1599
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:45,359
And you were in it

1600
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:47,903
- Oh, was l interesting?

1601
01:37:49,572 --> 01:37:51,532
- You were you.

1602
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,829
You're leaving, aren't you?

1603
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:02,751
- Yeah, you know,

1604
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:07,047
'cause of the situation.

1605
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:08,048
- Yeah.

1606
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,425
l figured.

1607
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:21,103
You know,
spring is my favorite time,

1608
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:23,897
'cause summer people
aren't here yet

1609
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:27,192
lt's not so fucking cold.

1610
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,028
- Yeah.

1611
01:38:30,196 --> 01:38:35,284
Um, l made you something.

1612
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:51,133
- That's the swan.

1613
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,306
The beautiful, graceful swan.

1614
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:01,894
It's—
Richard, it's perfect

1615
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:04,897
- Yeah, well...

1616
01:39:06,316 --> 01:39:08,817
- Thank you.

1617
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:17,200
- lt seems like we were
just getting started.

1618
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:25,167

1637
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:49,287
Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred,

1638
01:42:49,455 --> 01:42:52,833
as a well-earned
badge of honor,

1639
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,211
a cloak to be worn
to ward off life,

1640
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:59,047
as his safety.

1641
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:01,591
Solitude is who he was.

1642
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,426
This caused those in his life

1643
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,471
to view him
with a barely veiled contempt.

1644
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,141
Richard was certain
that he was not liked,

1645
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:10,851
which is hard on a man.

1646
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:13,019
Maybe it was because
he gave nothing

1647
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:15,355
that he received nothing
in return.

1648
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:19,860
ln any case, his situation
had become intolerable.

1649
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:21,778
The closest things
he had to friends

1650
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,406
were either imaginary
or extinct.

1651
01:43:24,574 --> 01:43:26,408
Richard had reached a point
in his life

1652
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:31,204
where this was no longer
enough.

1653
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:34,291
And then he met a girl,

1654
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:38,086
and she was warm,
and she was sad,

1655
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:39,921
and she was maybe lonely
in a way

1656
01:43:40,089 --> 01:43:42,966
that reminded him of himself.

1657
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:47,637
She'd lost things that a girl
should never have lost.

1658
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:51,516
And she knew things,
and she taught him.

1659
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:52,976
And Richard thought,

1660
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:59,482
"Maybe this is what friendship
feels like.

1661
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:03,028
Maybe."

1662
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:11,411
lt was just a glimpse.

1663
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:15,207
They'd barely begun, really.

1664
01:44:18,628 --> 01:44:22,255
But in those long
few winter days,

1665
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:26,092
she'd given him so much,

1666
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:29,387
enough so that Richard
could go on.

1667
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:40,190
And what had he given her?

1668
01:44:40,358 --> 01:44:44,444
Just a few words on a page.

1669
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:49,032
Not much, perhaps.

1670
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:54,037
But for Abby,
he hoped it was enough.
