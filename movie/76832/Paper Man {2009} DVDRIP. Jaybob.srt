- The pictures didn't
do it justice.

25
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:34,300
- Oh.

26
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,900
- l sense danger.
- It's fine.

27
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:42,967
l'm fine.

28
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,133
- Were you carsick?

29
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,867
- Of course not
Of course l wasn't carsick.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's—

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,700
- Richard, l'm not sure
you fully understand

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
what you're walking into here.

33
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:53,200
There are countless unknowns.

34
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,800
- l can handle this, okay?

35
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:55,700
Please, just give me
some credit

36
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:56,800
- There's gonna be crying.

37
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:00,067
- l'm having trouble believing
how great this is.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,767
You comin'?

39
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,133
Whoa!
Good Lord.

40
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,967
Claire.

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,967
- Oh, poor thing.

42
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,267
Well, at least it was quick.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,933
lt's a clean thoracic tear.

44
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,233
- We should give him
a proper buriaI.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,667
l feel like l just lost
my bearings.

46
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,500
- Oh, thanks.

47
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:43,600
- Yeah.

48
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,833
Oh, this is charming.

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,167
Oh, the water works.

50
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,767
Good.

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,367
l don't know if the stove works.

52
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,600
Maybe they have take-out menus.

53
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:10,833
- Ah, listen!

54
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,600
Come here, come here, come here.

55
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,467
There she is, the mighty sea.

56
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,100
Still in there.

57
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,067
- Wow.

58
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,433
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

59
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,700
- That's so—that's—

60
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,667
l'm gonna look around.

61
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,833
- Oh, they've got plenty
of toweIs.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,467
We didn't need to bring any.

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,533
Oh, well.

64
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,500
The fuse box is in
the linen closet, Richard.

65
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,500
Oh, there's a skylight

66
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,667
Richard?

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,033
- The couch

68
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,267
could be a problem.

69
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,767
- Don't fixate.

70
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,533
- You're right

71
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,933
Wonderful, everything.

72
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,167
- Good, that's right

73
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,200
You want to grab the luggage
out of the car?

74
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:09,500
l'll do it

75
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:12,800
- Phil Turley
is very concerned, Claire,

76
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:15,967
about the community's efforts
to protect the nesting grounds

77
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,600
of the native tern.

78
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,100
As he should be.

79
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,533
- Listen, l put all
my numbers

80
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,600
on the top sheet
of that memo pad by the phone,

81
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,500
so if you want to tear that off
and tape it up somewhere.

82
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,867
l'm in surgery from 9:00
tiII noon.

83
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,800
So l'll check in after that,
okay?

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,333
- Great, good.

85
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,133
- Are you sure you don't want
to rent a car?

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,733
- Didn't they say there was
a bike?

87
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,767
l'll dig it out of the garage.

88
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:42,733
lt's ten minutes to town.

89
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,400
This will be ideal.

90
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:45,867
- Okay, it's up to you.

91
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,400
- So what does your schedule
Iook Iike for tomorrow?

92
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,567
- I'II start
at the very beginning.

93
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,133
That's a very good place
to start.

94
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,600
- Speaking of which...

95
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,267
Close your eyes.

96
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,367
Okay, you can open them.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,733
- Oh.

98
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,000
- Mark just got one of these.

99
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,367
He said a five-year-old
couId use it

100
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,100
- Richard, use your words.

101
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,267
- ActuaIIy, I was thinking
of writing on the Corona.

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,967
- Oh.

103
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,400
- No, but this is good.

104
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,667
No, this is—
you're right

105
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,767
This is better.

106
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:30,867
- Yeah.

107
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,033
Okay.

108
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,367
- Richard.

109
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,000
These fabrics.

110
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,267
- Oh, l talked to Peter
and Lucy,

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,500
and they said they might come
out the weekend of the 2nd.

112
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,167
- Great, great

113
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,533
Who?

114
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,100
- Peter and Lucy?

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,067
- Oh, good, yeah.

116
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,267
They're always fun.

117
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:11,333
- Yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:12,800
You didn't bring—

119
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,267
you didn't bring him out here,
did you?

120
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,400
- What?
No.

121
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,133
No, of course not

122
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:23,800
- No. Okay.

123
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,400
All right

124
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,900
Have a productive week, okay?

125
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:38,400
- Save some lives!

126
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:15,533
ding!

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,500
beep!

128
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,867
- Hot wheels.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,800
- Let go of me.

130
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,233
- Do you remember the time

131
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
that you ran over the neighbor's
guinea pig, Little Fluff?

132
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:53,567
- No, l do not

133
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,800
Now will you let me go?

134
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,700
- Look, we both know that you're
not equipped to deal

135
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,133
with your current circumstances.

136
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,667
And untiI you prove otherwise,
l feel compelled to be on hand.

137
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,467
- Could you step aside?
l have things to do.

138
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,433
- l sense danger.

139
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,867
- Would you stop saying that?

140
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,533
- Be careful!

00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,467
The squeaks drive me nuts.

158
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,467
lt's a nice bike, though.

159
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:54,533
l used to have one of these
when I was your age.

160
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,433
So how come you're following me?

161
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:05,400
- l'm not

162
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,933

163
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,900

00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,667
- Are too.
How come?

166
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,300
- Well, l was just—
l kind of—

00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:24,100
l thought maybe you might know
somebody who—

171
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,067
- Yeah, okay.

172

When do you need me for?

173
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,867

Merton regarded his solitude
as something s—

186
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,333

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,600
You can't live without me.

188
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,567

189
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:54,933
l'm communing with nature here.

190
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,067
Why are you so incapable
of believing

191
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,967
l can do things perfectly fine
on my own?

192
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,600
- Because you never have.

193
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:01,567

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,733
Huh?
How many times?

197
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,667
"l'm gonna go through these
baIIet Iessons aIone."

198
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,133
- Do not mock me.

199
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,667
- "I'm gonna, Iike, go through
the college years, like, alone."

200
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,867
- Okay, that—

201
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,267

Captain.

202
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,333
l'm gonna resuscitate
my half-dead marriage alone."

203
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
- Zip it
You kindly zip it

204
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,100
- Please, for once in your life,
go it alone.

205
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,700
- GIadIy!
Good day, sir.

206
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,167
- A good day.

207
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,100
- You just don't like it
because l'm on an upswing.

208
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,667
- Oh, my God.

209
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,733
- Merton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

210
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,667
Merton?

211
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,000
Burton.

212
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,767
Milton?
MiIton.

213

214
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:52,867
- Hey.

215
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:55,200
Sorry, l'm a little early.

216
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,167

00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,500
l'm sorry, l forgot your name.

218
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,833
- Oh, that's okay.

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,800
l forgot yours too,

220
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,800
but l was thinking
that it was Paul

221
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,567
or Steve or Dave, maybe?

222
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,533
- Richard.

223
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:08,500

lt's a Love-A-Lot for the kid.

227
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,400
- Oh, well...

228
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:31,667
Actually—

229
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,767
- Um, so you just moved here?

230
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,200
Where from?

231
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,000
- Just the city.

232
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:38,933
- Oh.

233
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
- Yeah, it's only temporary.

234
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:43,333
My wife Claire is at New York
Presbyterian.

235
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:44,933
She's a vascular surgeon.

236
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,000
- Oh, wow.

237
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:47,967

00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:49,200
She's cute.

239
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,133
- Oh, yeah, that's the doctor.

240
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,467
- My parents went through
a trial separation once too.

241
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,633
- What?
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

242
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,933
That's not what's happening
here.

243
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:57,867
No, that's—
no.

244
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:00,267
That's—

245
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,700
l don't—is it?

246
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,433
- Well, you should probably
find out

247
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,400
- Huh.

248
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:09,133
- ls it sleeping, the baby?

249
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,633
- The thing about that baby is—

250
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
are you thirsty?

251
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,400
- Um, no.

252
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,400
- Oh, look.

253
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:20,167
The baby is not here.

254
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,133
- What do you mean?

255
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,933
- Basically, l guess,

256
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,300
there is no baby...

257
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,067
as such.

258
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,800
- There's no kid?

259
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:33,733
- Nope.

260
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,367
- Well, shit

261
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,967

which is extremely unsafe,
by the way.

317
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,533
- You've known this stalker guy
five minutes.

318
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,700
You're already making him soup?

320

He is a writer.

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600

- Nothing.

326

- That doesn't strike you
as odd somehow?

327
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,000
A babysitter?

328
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,667
- l'm under a lot of pressure,
okay, to produce.

329
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,000
People expect literature:

the doctor, my publisher.

331
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,333

00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,000
three months to crack
this thing.

333
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,267
- And the girl helps how?

334
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,467
- Was l popular in high school,
in retrospect?

335
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
- And the girl helps how?

336
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,867
- Do you have to question
every decision I make?

337
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,267
- Make better decisions.

338
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:46,533
- Just do the voice.

339
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:49,233
- Oh.

340
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,200
Oh, now he needs me.

341
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,633
- At this juncture, yes.

342
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,267
- Juncture?
- Yes.

343
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
- Oh.
- Yes, just do it

344
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,633
When the world is in peril,

345
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,867
when evil surrounds you,

346
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:19,667
when danger is lurking,

347
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,067
who do you call?

348
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:27,033
Captain Excellent!

349
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:31,800
- l'm bolstered!

350
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,433
There's something out there
in the woods.

351
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,533
- Oh, my God.

352
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,300
The wolf.
Didn't you hear?

353
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,067
lt escaped from the zoo
this morning.

354
00:21:59,133 --> 00:21:59,867
- There's a zoo here?

355
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,900
No, l'm just—

356
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,367
WeII, whatever it is,
l won't let it get you.

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,367
Come on, there's soup.

358
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,300
- What?

359
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:13,700
- Yeah, l made soup.

360
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,167
l thought that you might
be cold.

361
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,700
What did you do tonight?

362
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,667
- l went to the shore,
did some thinking.

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,633
- Oh, for three hours
in the freezing cold?

364
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,367
- You made this?

365
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:34,367
- Yeah.

366
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:35,467
- How?

367
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,500
- l don't know.

368
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,100
A couple of carrots,

369
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:43,600
an onion, one of your beers.

370
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:44,900
Oh, l hope that's okay.

371
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,100
l just kind of helped myself.

372
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,333
- No, it's fantastic.

373
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,433
- Oh, well, you haven't even
tasted it yet

374
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,100
- No, no, no, l mean,
the fact of it is fantastic,

375
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,433
that you made something
from nothing.

376
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,667
- Oh, you can, you know,

377
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,133
kind of make soup
out of anything.

378
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
That's the great thing about it

379
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,267
Just whatever's Ieft
laying around, you know.

380
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,867
You can take all the crap

381
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,567
that's rotting in your fridge
and throw out,

382
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:15,467
or you could toss it into a pot
and make soup out of it

383
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:17,733
So l go with soup.

384
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,067
Oh.

385
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,900
lt's superb.

386
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:26,300
- Thank you.

387
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,433
- No, really.

388
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,400
lt's excellent

389
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,267
- Do you remember the moment
when you reaIized

390
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,167
that soup didn't have
to come out of a can,

391
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,267
you know, like all manufactured,

392
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
that your chicken noodle
couId kick

393
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,933
Campbell's chicken noodle's ass
any day of the week?

394
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,467
- I think I'm having
that moment right now.

395
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Plus, it's very nutritious,

396
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:50,967
which is good.

397
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,333
- What—what happened there?

398
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,600
- Oh.

399
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,667
Sorry.

400
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:07,967
It's just—
it's a boyfriend thing.

401
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,533
Just, um,

402
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,800
the bird kind of reminded me
of him.

403
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,400
He's chickenshit

404
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:18,400
- Oh.

405
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,767
Actually, it's not a chicken.

406
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,333
lt's the North American
heath hen.

407
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,167
Related to the greater
prairie chicken,

408
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,733
but not technically a chicken.

409
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:25,700
- Oh.

410
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,000
- lt's extinct now.

411
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,933
The last few lived out here

412
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,833
out on the nature preserve
at Camp Hero.

413
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
- Hmm.

414
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,500
l did not know that

415
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,967
- l'm not a birder or anything.

416
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,533
lt's just, the last surviving
heath hen

417
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,367
is a character in...

418
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:43,467
- ln what?

419
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:44,600
- That bird's just—

420
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,067
it's the main character of this
book that,

421
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:50,233
you know, l'm attempting
to produce, to write,

422
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,133
finish.

423
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,233
Actually, to start.

424
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Saying it out loud just sounded
kind of stupid.

425
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,500
-Well, there's Chicken Little,

426
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,500
you know, and Little Red Hen.

427
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:09,700
- Henny Penny.

428
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,133
- Yeah, exactly.

429
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,067
Exactly.

430
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,867
Oh, you know, there's a lot
of books out there

431
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:19,200
about poultry.

432
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,133
- We should settle up.

433
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:29,200
- Okay.

434
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,000
- ls that about right?

435
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,067
- Actually, l'm $12 an hour.

436
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:41,067
- Oh, okay.

437
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,000
l only have a $10.

438
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,167
Do you have change?

439
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,500
- Let me check.

440
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,067
- So how come your boyfriend's
a chickenshit?

441
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:51,333
None of my business.

442
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,333
Sorry.

443
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,400
- No, he just—

444
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:58,967
He just bugs.

445
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:02,067
You know, it's like when he's
with me, it's all,

446
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,633
"Oh, you know."

447
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,200
And when he's with his friends,
he's all, "Ugh, whatever."

448
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,267
lt's just—you know,
he's a fucking chickenshit

449
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:12,000
- Right

450
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:15,033
- Okay, so thank you.

451
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,000
- Mmm-hmm.

452
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,967
Thank you.

453
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,833
Can l ask you a quick question?

454
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:28,333
- Sure.

455
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:32,567
- Does this couch
make me look fat?

456
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:35,467
- l wouldn't sit there.

457
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,467
- Hmm.

458
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,867
- So okay.

459
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:41,067
Good luck with the chicken book.

460
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,900
- Same time next week?

461
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,467
- Um...

462
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,300
Okay.

463
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:59,133
- You didn't tell me your name.

464
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:12,067
- Richard?

465
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,500
Richard.

466
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:21,067
- Are we separated?

467
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:22,400
- What?

468
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:25,267
- ls this a trial separation,
what we're doing?

469
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,167
- What makes you think that?

470
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,467
- l don't know.

471
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,767
Our separateness.

472
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,000
- Sweetie,
if we were separating,

473
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,667
you'd be the first to know.

474
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,833
- l guess.

475
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,700
- Well, we would have
discussed it

476
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,133
Trust me.

477
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,500
- Okay.

478
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:48,433
Whew, good.

479
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,667
lt just moved.

480
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,400
- Well, that's not possible.

481
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,833
lt's been boiled to death.

482
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,367
- Poor little Louie.

483
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,900
- Well, don't name it, Richard.

484
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,200
l mean, do whatever you want

485
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,600
No, don't—
don't name your food.

486
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,067
Here.

487
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:12,133
- Oh.

488
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:20,000
- There.
Okay?

489
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,533
Hmm?

490
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,433
There you go.

491
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,467
Hmm?

492
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,867
- lf only everything
in the world

493
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,067
could be covered in butter.

494
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,367
What a world that would be.

495
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:39,933
- l guess.

496
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:49,833
- What a buttery world.

497
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,733
- He any good?

498
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,700
- l don't know.

499
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:07,433
lt's kind of wordy.

500
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,367
- So what does
the renderer render?

501
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,633
- l haven't gotten
to that part yet

502
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,333
- Well, let me know.

503
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,000
l'm sure it's something
briIIiant

504
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,633
- What were you doing
in my gym class?

505
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:20,633
- Nothing.

506
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,333
- You think l didn't see you?

507
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,133
- l was just there
for moral support.

508
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:25,600
- l suck at volleyball.

509
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:26,833
- You do not

510
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,233
- l suck at everything.

511
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,833
No, you don't

512
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,967
You're fantastic
across the board.

513
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:38,500
- Would you just shut up?

514
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,467
- We never go out anymore.

515
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:42,033
- Look, you got to leave, okay?

516
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,067
l'm meeting Bryce later.

517
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,867
- He's beneath you, you know.

518
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,000
- Why you got to wear
so much shit?

519
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,500
- 'Cause it's freezing in here.

520
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,033
Run the heater.

521
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,833
- You want to pay for the gas?

522
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,100
- Are you done?

523
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,067
Yeah.

524
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,700
See you later.

525
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:14,833
- Okay.

526
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,800
- Well, just go for it

527
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,400
- l—l—
l'm going.

528
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:23,333
Okay, well, he's dead now.

529
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:24,267
Why don't you go?

530
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,833
Damn it
lt's your turn.

531
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:27,167
l don't know how you do this
all day.

532
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,600
l mean, there's so much
pressure.

533
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:29,600
- Well, it's just a game.

534
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,467
- l know.
- No one's dying here.

535
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:32,433
- Go ahead.

536
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,500
- We can play something else.

537
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,033
- No, it's fine.
lt's—you know.

538
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,667
- All right

539
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,667
Let's see.

540
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,367
That one's on my side.

541
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,433
- Yeah.

542
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,467
Well, that was fun.

543
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:57,433
- Yes, it was.

544
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,533
- Fun-packed weekend.

545
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,100
- Okay, weII,
have a productive week.

546
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,667
And l'll see you on the 15th.

547
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:03,633
- Yeah.

548
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:22,400
What?

549
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:27,300
You're standing.

550
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,333
Oh.

551
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,400
Really?

552
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,100
That's enough of that

553
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:45,900
You remember when you stuck
that dime up your nose

554
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:48,433
and tried to snort it
out your mouth?

555
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,833
The cowboy outfit for your
seventh grade school picture?

556
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,333
You remember?

557
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,800
The horny toads,
the hunger strike?

558
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,667
l cautioned you against
those decisions,

559
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,867
but you didn't listen to me,

560
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,500
which is fine,
'cause you were just a kid.

561
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,300
But now it's grow-up time.

562
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:03,867
The babysitter?

563
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,900
Bad, Richard.

564
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:08,267
Very, very bad, Richard.

565
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,000
That chair's gonna be a problem.

566
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:13,733
- Sakes alive.

567
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,233
- "Making the monkey.

568
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,900
"A humorous monkey is popular
in zooIogicaI gardens.

569
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:24,433
"For exampIe, it is IoveIy
that you make a baby monkey

570
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,733
"with small paper and that you
put it on a mother monkey.

571
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:43,767
Fold A, top right corner."

572
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:46,367
- Why origami?

573
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:48,000
Why now?

574
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:50,033
- l needed something to do
with my hands.

575
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,067
- l'm having trouble telling
which is the monkey

576
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,733
and which is the swan.

577
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,933
- Oh, that can't be all of them.

578
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,433
- No, no, there's a bunch more
in the truck.

579
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,400
- Oh, great

580
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,333
Start bringing them in.

581
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:22,467
Horton r—

582
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:30,800
- Richard, Richard,

583
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,400
for the Iove of God,
don't do this please.

584
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:33,367
Listen to me.

585
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:35,467
You're making a huge mistake.

586
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,767
You're going for it

587
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:43,067
- lt's Abby.

588
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,600
My name.

589
00:34:58,133 --> 00:34:59,900
Oh, you got rid of the couch.

590
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,300
- Yeah, the couch was a problem.

591
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,400
Um...

592
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,167
This is for you.

593
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,433
- Oh.

594
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,967
lt's...

595
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,133
it's a fish.

596
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,067
A dead fish.

597
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:17,900
A whole dead fish.

598
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:19,000
- Yeah.

599
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:22,400
My dad fishes, like,
for a living.

600
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:23,333
lt's a fluke.

601
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,133
- ln what sense?

602
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,867
- lt's called a fluke.

603
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:29,333
lt's—the water around here
is swimming with them.

604
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:30,300
- Ah, yeah.

605
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:31,267
So it's edible?

606
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:34,700
- Yeah.

607
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:35,667
- A fluke.

608
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,467
That's great

609
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,467
Thanks.

610
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,533
- So l read that book you wrote.

611
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,767
l hope that's okay.

612
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:49,733
- Reading my book?

613
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,700
Of course.

614
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:53,733
You may be one of the few.

615
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,267
- So are you going out tonight?

616
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,133
Out on the town?

617
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,500
- Uh, l don't know.

618
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:01,467
What do the people of Montauk
do on a Friday night?

619
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,033
- The Yardarm's totally dead.

620
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,900
So you'd probably like that

621
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:07,533
lt's down by the harbor.

622
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,800
You can't miss it

623
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:13,067
- What did you think
of the book?

624
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,000
- l don't know.

625
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:15,033
What did you think of it?

626
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,300
- Me?
Oh, l—

627
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,667
you know,
it's got its strengths,

628
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,933
got its moments.

629
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,833
l hate it

630
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:32,533
- You should probably
put that fish in the fridge,

631
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,867
'cause it'll stink up
the whole house.

632
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,567
Trust me.
I know.

633
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:50,833
What?

634
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,200
- Soup ingredients.

635
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,900
You know, if you feel like it

636
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,600
- You bought me a rutabaga.

637
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,533
- You're making this
too easy on me.

638
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,500
- Well, like l said, you know,
if you feel like it

639
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:09,700
No pressure.

640
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:19,333
- Your book was cool, actually.

641
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:24,667
lt kind of blew me away.

642
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,033
- You planning on having
something to eat?

643
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,167
- Thanks, no.

644
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:53,867
homemade.

645
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:55,467
- Can't beat that

646
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
Another beer?

647
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,400
- Sure.

648
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:10,667
- So what brings you down
to the South Shore, then?

649
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:11,633
- A book.

650
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:12,867
A bird.

651
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:14,967
A book about a bird.

652
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:19,267
Research work, you know.

653
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:22,267
- My wife makes
a good chowder.

654
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,667
Not so much a clam chowder
Iike you'd expect,

655
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:28,800
more of a corn chowder.

656
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:34,067
- My Lorraine, she can shuck
a dozen oysters

657
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,467
in a minute and a half.

658
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,933
- Local Malpeque oyster?

659
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,367
- That's the one.

660
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,867
- My wife invented and patented
a Iifesaving poIymer shunt

661
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,867
- Shunt, you say?

662
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:47,000
- Shunt

663
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,000
So there's our heath hen,

664
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,000
hunkered down at Camp Hero.

665
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:00,967
- Just down the road here?

666
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:02,333
- Yep.
As game warden—

667
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,300
- The Alfred guy.

668
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,267
- Yeah, correct

669
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,200
Alfred is his actual name.

670
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:10,400
In the book, I am going
to call him Horton or Morton.

671
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:13,600
Anyway, so he's brought
his flock of heath hens

672
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:15,467
back from the brink
of extinction.

673
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,633
- Awesome.

674
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,133
- l mean, he was down to 11
of them.

675
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,433
11, you know, but now with care,
and dare I say, Iove,

676
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,400
and incubators,

677
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,633
he's got 200.

678
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
And it's like the hen is saved.

679
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,333
- Safe, thank God.

680
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,500
- But because our story
is a tragedy,

681
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,933
you know what happens?
- What?

682
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,233
- Fire.

683
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,300
- No!
- Come on!

684
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,733
- Oh, yeah,
it sweeps across the preserve.

685
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,133
Of course, the heath hen,

686
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:38,167
not nature's most intelligent
bird to begin with...

687
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
- l hear ya.

688
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:40,900
- She just sits in her nest

689
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:42,533
You know, and she doesn't have
the sense to run

690
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,667
or fly or waddle.

691
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,967
You know,
when the fire runs out,

692
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,500
there's just five birds
remaining.

693
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,133
- Roast chicken.

694
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:56,800
- What happens to the five?

695
00:39:58,033 --> 00:39:59,367
- They dwindle.

696
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:02,033
They dwindle

697
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,433
till there's just one left,
you know?

698
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:06,533
Just one.

699
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,533
Just one poor stupid
little thing.

700
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,567
You know,
it's just a stupid bird.

701
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:17,333
Just one.

702
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:25,533
lt's a true story.

703
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:29,200
- Another round
for my friend here, Mike.

704
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,267
- Chicken shit

705
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,000
Oh, you did make soup.

706
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:11,333
Bless your heart.

707
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,400
Oh.

708
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,200
Mm, oh.

709
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:18,800
Such a small act of kindness,

710
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:22,367
but l can't tell you
what that means to me.

711
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:23,300
- Well, it's no big deal.

712
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:24,700
lt's just soup.

713
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,133
- You are such a beautiful girl.

714
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,967
You are such a beautiful child.

715
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,133
- You're loaded.

716
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,567
- No, no, no, l—

717
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:35,600
well, yes.

718
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,267
- Okay, l should go.

719
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:38,633
Since tonight
was a little longer—

720
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,100
- You know what l am?

721
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:42,633
Let me tell you what l am,
just in case you're interested.

722
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,967
This is what l am.

723
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:45,233
- What?

724
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:48,067
- l am the only child
of an only child

725
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:49,367
and an only child.

726
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:50,667
And you know what that means.

727
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,400
- No cousins?

728
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:55,267
- lt means l am the end
of a bloodline,

729
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:57,267
the last of my kind.

730
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:59,333
- Okay, well,
then have some kids.

731
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:03,133
Said the babysitter.

732
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,100
lf you only knew.

733
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:06,867
- Okay.

734
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,700
Look, it's gonna be 60 bucks.

735
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,833
Okay, you should go to bed.

736
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:13,067
- l don't blame her, the doctor.

737
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:16,533
You know, she's just—
she's a human mechanic.

738
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,267
You know, she's got her hands
inside human beings every day.

739
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:21,733
They're just machines to her,
you know.

740
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:24,067
They're machines that break,

741
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:26,467
like rot factories.

742
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,000
So how can you create life

743
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,500
when you know it's gonna
end up in death?

744
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,467
l mean, l get that

745
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:34,233
l get it!

746
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,600
l don't blame her, but—

747
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,033
- Hey, l'm sorry.

748
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:40,467
- Eh.

749
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:49,267
See, she doesn't realize
that human beings are warm.

750
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,900
You know, they need contact

751
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,633
They need, you know—

752
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,467
you are such a beautiful girl.

753
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:55,900
You are such a beautiful child.

754
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:56,867
thud!

755
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,967
No, no!

756
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,133
thud!

757
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:05,533
- Shit

758
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,300
- l'm gonna go.

759
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,267
Why are men such dicks?

760
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,867
- Beats me.

761
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,833
- l just thought he was lonely.

762
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,267
- We're all lonely.

763
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,333
- l don't know.

764
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,600
Maybe l shouldn't have hit him.

765
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:32,233
- No, you definitely
should have.

766
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,500
Okay, would you rather?

767
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,200
- l don't want to play.

768
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,500
- Oh, come on.

769
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,733
Would you rather

770
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,333
have no TV for a year

771
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,067
or onIy be abIe
to watch The Golf Channel?

772
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:55,633
- Golf Channel.

773
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,300
- Yeah, me too.

774
00:43:57,433 --> 00:44:02,400
At least it's TV.

775
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:03,500
Your turn.

776
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:10,633
- Okay, would you rather have
no friends or no parents?

777
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:43,467
- Claire?

778
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,067
- Richard, the couch is outside.

779
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:47,067
- ls it the 15th already?

780
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,333
- Are you okay?

781
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,300
- Yes, l am.

782
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,267
- There's soup in the kitchen.

783
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:52,400
Have you been making soup?

784
00:44:52,633 --> 00:44:54,500
- l'll be right back.

785
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,133
- All right

786
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,067
You made the soup.

787
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,267
What babysitter?

788
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,900
Work is going great,
and l'm still not here.

789
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:10,867
Drink it up.

790
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,833
There you go.

791
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,867
Now get out there.

792
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:20,933
- You know the funny thing
about soup?

793
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:23,200
You get the ingredients
basicaIIy into the pot

794
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:26,067
along with the sauce and the—
not the sauce.

795
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:27,533
The juice.

796
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:29,300
- You mean the broth?

797
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:34,000
- Right, right, and then
it just needs some cooking.

798
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,133
- Richard, is anything wrong?

799
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,400
l'm not—

800
00:45:38,633 --> 00:45:39,733
l'm concerned.

801
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,867
- Oh, weII, thank you
for your concern, Claire.

802
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,667
Speaking of...
how are your patients?

803
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,533
Are they doing well?

804
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,267
And what are some
of their names?

805
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,333
- You know, you've got a bruise
right here.

806
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,367
- Oh, well, you know,
beaten down by life.

807
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:01,733
You know, winds of change.

808
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,633
Anyway, l want to do some
unIoading of boxes

809
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:05,900
if you want to pitch in.

810
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:09,133
Then we can grab some brunch.

811
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,233
- Oh, no, Richard, no.

812
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,200
Are these all—

813
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,367
- Oh, yes.

814
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,400
- Why?

815
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,000
Why would you do that
to yourseIf?

816
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:21,333
- Well, l just thought
as I embarked

817
00:46:21,533 --> 00:46:22,800
on the writing of my second—

818
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:24,233
my much anticipated
second novel,

819
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
that l should be reminded
of the remarkable,

820
00:46:26,567 --> 00:46:28,233
l mean, really
quite noteworthy failure

821
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,267
of my first noveI to seII
any copies whatsoever.

822
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,067
- Richard, l can't go
down this road with you.

823
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,233
- No, no, no, it's gonna be
very motivationaI, reaIIy.

824
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:53,433
- That was smooth.

825
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,400
- Hey, l got through it

826
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:55,867
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait

827
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,967
- What?

828
00:46:57,133 --> 00:46:58,567
- My super senses
are telling me something.

829
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,900
- What?
- Yes.

830
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,833
I think the doctor
may be on to you.

831
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,900
- Oh, hush your mouth.

832
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:03,867
- Knock, knock.

833
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,800
Who's there?

834
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,400
- Shit

835
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:12,067
What do you want?

836
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,500
- I came to see
if you were okay,

837
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:16,467
'cause your head was—

838
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:17,433
- lt's fine.
I'm fine.

839
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,200
You need to go.

840
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:20,433
- What?

841
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,067
- You need to go now.

842
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:25,400
- Well, screw you too.

843
00:47:25,567 --> 00:47:27,200
And you were the one
who came on to me,

844
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:29,133
by the way.

845
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,000
- What?

846
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:34,500
- Last night, asshole.

847
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,800
l was gonna apologize
for hitting you,

848
00:47:36,933 --> 00:47:37,733
but forget it

849
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,333
You're a creep.

850
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,867
- Wait, Abby.

851
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,633
- The doctor's
out of her shower, FYl.

852
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,467
- Richard, who was that?

853
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,000
- Girl scout

854
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,667
- Oh, okay.

855
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,600
- Horton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

856
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:10,700
Horton, Norton,

857
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:13,367
Norwood.

858
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:15,367
Norwood regarded his solitude
as s—

859
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:28,233
- How's it coming?

860
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,067
- Norwood regarded his solitude
as some—

861
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,833
- Richard, what's this?

862
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,800
- lt's a fluke.

863
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:48,800
- ln what way?

864
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:50,100
- The fish.
lt's called a fluke.

865
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:51,933
The water around here
is swimming with them.

866
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,500
- Oh, okay.

867
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,033
What were you planning
on doing with it?

868
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
- Do l have to have a plan?

869
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,533
Can't l just have a fish
in the house?

870
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,900
- Yes, fine.
l'm sorry.

871
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:03,200
- l thought we could cook it
then eat it

872
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:04,400
How's that?

873
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,033
- l guess l just hadn't caught
up with the fact

874
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,067
that you're a cook now.

875
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,233
- Okay, stop.
Stop it

876
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,200
You can stop.

877
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:52,433
Please stop now.

878
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:53,400
Stop it

879
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,667
Stop, stop, please!

880
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,100
Stop!

881
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:24,933
- Abby.

882
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,467
- Who the hell is that?

883
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,067
What the hell is she doing?

884
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,767
- l don't think l got a chance
to pay you the other night

885
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:40,733
How's $60?

886
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,700
- Keep it

887
00:50:41,867 --> 00:50:43,333
You don't even
have a kid, so—

888
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,000
- l think there was kind of
a misunderstanding

889
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:50,533
about some of my actions
or intentions.

890
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:51,833
I'm pretty sure
l said some things.

891
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,300
- Whatever.

892
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:55,200
I'm sure you're sorry
that you said all that stuff.

893
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,300
- l'm not sorry, actually,
about all that

894
00:50:57,467 --> 00:51:00,400
What l'm sorry about is that
l was so abrupt at the house.

895
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:01,400
lt was just—

896
00:51:01,567 --> 00:51:02,367
- Your wife was there.

897
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:03,533
Yeah, l figured that out

898
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,867
- Yes, it would have been,
you know,

899
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:05,833
awkward, you know?

900
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,600
- No, actually, l don't know.

901
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:12,100
- Well, Claire wouldn't really
understand our...

902
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:14,667
- Our what?

903
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,867
- Uh...

904
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,767
our friendship.

905
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:25,833
- Abby.

906
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,800
Come on.

907
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:28,133
We're out of here.

908
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,100
- Anyway, l wanted to let
you know that l respect you.

909
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,867
And is that Chickenshit?

910
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:39,300
Yeah.

911
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:40,267
- He's a good-looking guy.

912
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:43,333
- Yeah, he sure thinks so.

913
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,067
- You coming or what?

914
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,100
We're going to Turner's house,
smoke a jay.

915
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,067
- Yeah, just a minute.

916
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:49,833
- l'm Richard.

917
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,667
- Look, you said you wanted
to hang out more.

918
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,767
You in or out?

919
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:53,867
- lt's okay, Abby.

920
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,367
l don't want to keep you
from your jay.

921
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:58,800
- Who's your friend
with the bike?

922
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,300
- Abby's been babysitting
for me.

923
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,800
How's Wednesday night?

924
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,467
- Sure.

925
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:10,400
- Damn, girl, move your ass.

926
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:15,833
- Sorry.

927
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,400
- What's wrong with you?

928
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,667
- Richard!

929
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:40,933
- Hello!

930
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,033
Don't you do it!

931
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,433
- Richard, are you here?

932
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,433
- Yeah, l'll be right there.

933
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,100
- Listen to me.

934
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:53,267
Hey, this won't end well.

935
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,667
Hey, how you doing?

936
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:00,600
- Come on.

937
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:01,700
l want to show you something.

938
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:03,467
- Great, okay.

939
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,333
l have a problem with my hands.

940
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,667
- What do you mean?

941
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:16,267
- They won't do
what l want them to do.

942
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,333
- What do you want them to do?

943
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,300
- Anything.

944
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,867
l don't know, something useful.

945
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:25,467
l want them to build something
or make something.

946
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,933
- Like what?

947
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:29,900
- Even Jesus, l mean,
he was a carpenter.

948
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:32,100
You know, it wasn't enough
for him to save mankind.

949
00:53:32,267 --> 00:53:33,200
He needed a trade.

950
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:37,100
I'm a fIimsy man,
an insubstantial.

951
00:53:37,267 --> 00:53:40,067
- Well, compared to Jesus.

952
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:42,967
- l'm a paper man.

953
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:45,067
- No, you're a writer.

954
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,800
- Yeah, that's crucial.

955
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:49,833
- No, it is.

956
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:53,900
Here we are.

957
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,433
- Where?

958
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,800
- "lt is possible
to be so at sea

959
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,200
"when life and land have
slipped under the horizon.

960
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:06,400
l quietly wish to never see
either again."

961
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:07,333
- Did l write that?

962
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,400
l wrote that

963
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,733
- Hold this.

964
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:22,033
- Abby?

965
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:30,033
Abby!

966
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,433
Come on.

967
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,400
Abby!

968
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,367
Abby.

969
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:39,967
Abby!

970
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,267
Jesus, what are you doing?

971
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:50,667
What are you doing?

972
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,267
- Come here.

973
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,900
- You cannot do this.

974
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,733
You can't do that

975
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,767
- lt was me

976
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,533
that dared her
to go in.

977
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,833
lt was really cold.

978
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It was much,
much colder than today.

979
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,933
But you know, she wasn't gonna
turn down a dare.

980
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:48,433
We were like that

981
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,200
And l had eaten 23 oysters.

982
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,167
- Hmm.

983
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,833
- So l don't know

984
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,267
why she went in
in her cIothes.

985
00:55:57,433 --> 00:55:59,767
Um...

986
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:05,100
l guess maybe we thought
it wouId be warmer.

987
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:07,167
Kids.

988
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:17,367
And she was laughing,

989
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:22,200
and, you know, fine.

990
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:27,000
And then she was...

991
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,367
And then she was gone.

992
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:38,500
Just under and gone.

993
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:43,333
And l just stood there.

994
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:51,200
And then a couple hours later
my mom came

995
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,400
and found me.

996
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:55,767
And l guess, you know,

997
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,100
l was waiting for her
to swim back in.

998
00:56:58,267 --> 00:57:03,700
But she never did.

999
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,733
- How old?

1000
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:08,000
- Same age as me.

1001
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,000
We're twins.

1002
00:57:10,133 --> 00:57:13,033
- Oh.

1003
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,467
Oh, my God.

1004
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,867
- That was a long time ago.

1005
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:20,800
l like to go out there
every year

1006
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:23,967
and swim back to shore.

1007
00:57:24,133 --> 00:57:27,667
You know, l like to feel
the coId.

1008
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:32,400
- lt must have—

1009
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:36,700
l don't know what to say.

1010
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:40,100
- So we're both only children.

1011
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,200
- That was our thing every year,

1012
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:02,033
and you know it

1013
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:08,933
And you take that guy out there
on this day.

1014
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:11,267
He didn't even know her.

1015
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:12,667
- l know.

1016
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,667
- Remember when l was the only
one that wouId taIk to you

1017
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,400
for a long time?

1018
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,933
- l know, but—

1019
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:22,933
- He doesn't love you.

1020
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,667
lf that's what you think,
you're wrong.

1021
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:27,633
- What do you want me to say?

1022
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,700
- l could so move
to California.

1023
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:31,933
You shouldn't just assume

1024
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,200
l'll always be around,
'cause one day

1025
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,333
maybe l won't

1026
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:39,000
- Stop it

1027
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:42,000
- ls that what you want?

1028
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,067
- l don't have much of a story,
do I?

1029
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:52,733
- lt's all relative, l suppose.

1030
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:54,700
- Exactly.

1031
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:56,933
Other people seem
to have had events.

1032
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,267
Things have happened to them,

1033
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,333
life-altering occurrences.

1034
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
- l used to do things.

1035
00:59:02,633 --> 00:59:03,533
Remember?

1036
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,767
- This isn't about you.

1037
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:07,433
- Amazing things.

1038
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,333
What do you want me to say?

1039
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:11,467
- l don't know.

1040
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,933
- No, no, no, no.

1041
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,067
Tell me what you want me to say,
IiteraIIy,

1042
00:59:15,267 --> 00:59:21,267
'cause, frankly, at this point,
l got nothing.

1043
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,167
- But you have touched
several lives, Richard,

1044
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,133
through your work.

1045
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:30,300
lt's not about your happiness

1046
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,500
but the happiness you've brought
to others.

1047
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,467
- Hey, look,
it's the fund-raiser

1048
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:47,333
for the children's hospital
tomorrow night.

1049
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:50,500
And l was thinking of donating
that bottle of wine,

1050
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:52,933
the '71 Château Petrus.

1051
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:55,167
l know we were saving it
for a special occasion,

1052
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,200
but, well,
it's for a good cause.

1053
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,467
So what do you think?

1054
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:04,233
Richard, did you drink
that wine,

1055
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,167
that $5,000 bottle of wine?

1056
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:08,533
lt's not in the rack.

1057
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,067
lt was for the children.

1058
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:13,533
Will you call me, please?

1059
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:21,733
- Come in.

1060
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:27,267
- Whoa.

1061
01:00:27,433 --> 01:00:29,067
Check out the couch.

1062
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,533
- You like?

1063
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,467
- l made it with these.

1064
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,900
- All right!

1065
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:34,867
That's awesome.

1066
01:00:35,033 --> 01:00:38,367
- Yeah, sit
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

1067
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,133
- Uh!

1068
01:00:40,267 --> 01:00:41,067
- Huh?

1069
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:44,767
- lt's nice.

1070
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:48,467
- Oh, those—
just ideas for titIes.

1071
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:49,733
- For your new book?

1072
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,067
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool, what have you got?

1073
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,667
- Uh...

1074
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,933
Cloudscape,

1075
01:00:58,067 --> 01:01:00,700
Death and Desolation,

1076
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:01,667
The Daffodil.

1077
01:01:03,867 --> 01:01:07,767
- Memoirs of an Amnesiac,

1078
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,767
Bolero.

1079
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,133
- Bolero?

1080
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,667
- Okay.

1081
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,933
Ad Nauseam,

1082
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,233
Balm of Silence.

1083
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,667
No?

1084
01:01:15,867 --> 01:01:17,467
Old Miss Ptarmigan's
Blackberry Wine?

1085
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,400
- Whoa.

1086
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:19,667
- Let's forget it

1087
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,733
Titles are impossible.

1088
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,800
- Paper Man.

1089
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:51,800
- You seem a lot more
interesting than me.

1090
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,533
- l'm not

1091
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:56,733
It just seems that way
because l have a dead sister.

1092
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:00,100
- Where you been all day?

1093
01:02:00,267 --> 01:02:01,200
- l don't know.

1094
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:03,133
- Whatever.

1095
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:04,600
So the party's off this weekend.

1096
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,067
Turner's mom busted him.

1097
01:02:07,867 --> 01:02:10,400
- So what about the cove?

1098
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:12,733
- lt's fucking cold out there.

1099
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:13,700
- Big deal.

1100
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:14,667
So the party's off.

1101
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,933
- What kind of party?

1102
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,267
- What do mean
"What kind of party?"

1103
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,900
A fucking party.
- Just nothing.

1104
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:20,067
Just some friends hanging out

1105
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:21,467
- You could use my place.

1106
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:23,967
- What?

1107
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,933
- Seriously?

1108
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:25,867
- Yeah, why not?

1109
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,600
This weekend's not so good.

1110
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:28,733
My wife's back.

1111
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,400
But you know,
we could do next week.

1112
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:31,600
Friday?

1113
01:02:31,733 --> 01:02:33,533
- Friday is cool.

1114
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,500
- Really?

1115
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,967
- Yeah, l'll get a keg.

1116
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:38,733
- Nice!
Nice.

1117
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:39,967
- What else do you guys need?

1118
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:42,333
Appetizers, you know,
paper plates and stuff?

1119
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,133
- No, no, no.

1120
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,433
We're okay.

1121
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,400
We've got it covered.

1122
01:02:46,533 --> 01:02:48,533
- Great, we're on.

1123
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:49,600
- Righteous.

1124
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:50,800
Thanks, man.

1125
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,333
- You didn't have to do that

1126
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,333
- Ah, it'll be fun.

1127
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,700
- Richard!

1128
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,467
Richard?

1129
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:25,400
Richard, please.

1130
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:31,900
- Hi.

1131
01:03:33,033 --> 01:03:34,733
When the world is in peril,

1132
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,833
when evil surrounds you,
when dange—

1133
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:39,867
Okay.

1134
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,267
- Richard, help me.

1135
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:47,600
- You don't like it?

1136
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,167
- All the furniture is outside.

1137
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,267
And what the hell is this?

1138
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,933
- You seem disappointed,
going off your body language.

1139
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,233
- You don't pick up the phone
once this week.

1140
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,633
You don't call me once.

1141
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,633
l drive all the way out here,
and there's this.

1142
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,867
Richard, say something.

1143
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:19,467
What's this?

1144
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,900
- What's what?

1145
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:22,467
- This.
Whose is this?

1146
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:24,433
- Will you just tell her?

1147
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,200
- Claire?

1148
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,933
- Yes?

1149
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,667
- Are we unhappy,

1150
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,400
or are we just pretending
to be unhappy?

1151
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:35,800
- What do you mean?

1152
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:38,333
- Are we just pretending
to be unhappy

1153
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,333
to add drama to our lives

1154
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,533
so that we seem somehow
more substantial?

1155
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,767
l mean, think about it

1156
01:04:45,933 --> 01:04:47,800
Our lives
are embarrassingly easy.

1157
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,100
We've got plenty of money.

1158
01:04:49,267 --> 01:04:50,200
We got friends.

1159
01:04:50,367 --> 01:04:51,267
Well, you've got friends.

1160
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:52,800
There are people out there

1161

dying of black lung
or something.

1165
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,300

- What?
- l don't know.

1167
01:05:08,933 --> 01:05:11,933
Doesn't it feel like
we're faking it,

1168
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,600
our unhappiness?

1169

We're not 23 anymore.

1175
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,467
You need to pull it together.

1176
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,067
Pick up the phone this week.

1177
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:47,800
And bring the fucking furniture
in from the Iawn.

- No, you're starting too high.

1195
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,000
You need to go down at the base
of the chin.

1196
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:28,967
- Oh.

1197
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,700
And then cut up from there.

1198

Okay, would you rather
always walk backwards

1206
01:07:53,267 --> 01:07:55,867
or stub your toe every time
you took a step?

1207
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,267

01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,567
- Chickenshit

1328
01:14:32,733 --> 01:14:35,000
- What did you call me?

1329
01:14:35,133 --> 01:14:36,000
- Chickenshit bastard.

1330
01:14:36,133 --> 01:14:39,133
- You don't talk to me
like that

1331
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,400
Who the hell are you?

1332
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:41,733
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1333
01:14:41,867 --> 01:14:44,700
You don't talk to me like that,
you fucking freak.

1334
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,533
- You think you can threaten me?
You're a chiId.

1335
01:14:47,867 --> 01:14:49,133

1336
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,267

1337
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,233
- Bryce, get the fuck

1338
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,400
What are you doing?
Stop it

1339
01:14:54,567 --> 01:14:55,667
Are you okay?

1340
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,200
- What's the deaI?
What's the deal here?

1341
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:59,633
You fucking him?
- Stop it, Bryce.

1342
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,667
- SeriousIy,

1343
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,600
- No.

1344
01:15:01,767 --> 01:15:03,000
- l don't give a shit

1345
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:03,967
He can have her.

1346
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,933
She's fucking crazy anyway.

1347
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:07,467
Why don't you go back
to the Iooney bin

1348
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:08,800
where you belong?

1349
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:10,200
And take him with you.

1350
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:12,533
- Get the fuck out

1351
01:15:12,733 --> 01:15:14,000

What the fuck are you

1355
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,600
Get out of here.
Party's over.

1356
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:32,467
- Chickenshit is an asshole.

1357
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:34,500
- Yeah.

1358
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:40,267

1359
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,300

1360
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:51,333
- l love you.

1361
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:55,300
- What?

1362
01:15:55,467 --> 01:16:02,033
- Not in any inappropriate way,

1363
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:07,433
nothing that's not,
you know, decent or—

1364
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,567
l just find when l examine
my heart

1365
01:16:12,733 --> 01:16:18,467
l find...

1366
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:22,467
l think that there's love
there...

1367
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,133
For you.

1368
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,200
Yeah.

1369
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:34,800
l love you.

1370
01:16:42,533 --> 01:16:46,467
- lt was...

1371
01:16:46,633 --> 01:16:48,533
lt wasn't really a looney bin.

1372
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:51,900
lt was...

1373
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,100
l mean, l was only there
for a coupIe months,

1374
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:02,933
you know, just untiI I...

1375
01:17:03,133 --> 01:17:08,467
My parents thought..

1376
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:11,600
l don't know.

1377
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,933
l never told them.

1378
01:17:19,367 --> 01:17:24,000
l never told anyone.

1379
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,500
lt was a pact

1380
01:17:35,867 --> 01:17:39,100
Me and Amy

1381
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,200
were both supposed to go

1382
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:46,667
into the water,
and she did it

1383
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:52,433
And l swam back.

1384
01:17:58,233 --> 01:18:02,533
l swam back.

1385
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:07,067
l couldn't—

1386
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:15,200
l don't know what we were
so unhappy about

1387
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:19,900
l mean...

1388
01:18:20,067 --> 01:18:24,600
what could we have been
so unhappy about?

1389
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,667
Eight

1390
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:37,567
l guess you're too young to know
that you can get over anything.

1391
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:20,933
- He's always made
poor decisions.

1392
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,400
- Same with her.

1393
01:19:24,533 --> 01:19:26,467
- You feel helpless.

1394
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,967
How long you been with her?

1395
01:19:33,133 --> 01:19:34,700
- Since she was eight

1396
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:35,667
You?

1397
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:38,333
- Oh, Christ

1398
01:19:38,533 --> 01:19:41,033
That's got to be over 40 years.

1399
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,467
Second grade.

1400
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,467
- lsn't he a little old for you?

1401
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,667
- l keep telling him that

1402
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,767
He never listens.

1403
01:19:52,933 --> 01:19:54,233
- They never do.

1404
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,467
- No.

1405
01:19:56,633 --> 01:19:59,833
- What's your gig?

1406
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:01,933
- l've pretty much done it all.

1407
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:07,833
Battled monsters under the bed,
been a cheerIeader,

1408
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,867
confidant

1409
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,933
These days, it's a bit of a
mystery, to tell you the truth.

1410
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:14,900
You?

1411
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:16,867
- l'm crazy in love with her.

1412
01:20:19,467 --> 01:20:20,267
Tough one.

1413
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,733
- Yeah.

1414
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,500
lt's been all right

1415
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:26,800
l think she's almost done
with me.

1416
01:20:26,933 --> 01:20:29,233
- Good.

1417
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:30,200
Great

1418
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,500
Get out while you can.

1419
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:37,900
l tell you, they open the door,
you run.

1420
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:41,133
You don't want to end up
Iike me.

1421
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,200
- Guess not

1422
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,000
- Captain Excellent

1423
01:20:50,267 --> 01:20:51,867
- Christopher.

1424
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,200
Nice to meet you.

1425
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,100
- See you around.

1426
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,033
- Oh.

1427
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,933
- What? What?
What? What?

1428
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,033
- You son of a bitch!

1429
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,800
You son of a bitch!

1430
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:53,067
- Don't overreact here.

1431
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,500
- Shut up.

1432
01:21:54,667 --> 01:21:56,267
Don't tell me how to react
- lt's not like that

1433
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,867
- Shut up!

1434
01:21:59,033 --> 01:22:00,467
What is this, Richard?

1435
01:22:00,633 --> 01:22:01,600
What—
who is that?

1436
01:22:01,733 --> 01:22:02,933
Who the fuck is that?

1437
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,667
- She's the babysitter.

1438
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,500
- Get out

1439
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:08,500
Get out

1440
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:10,200
Get out!

1441
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:13,700
- Hi, Lucy.

1442
01:22:13,867 --> 01:22:15,667
Hi, Peter.

1443
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,700
- Hi.

1444
01:22:17,867 --> 01:22:20,267
Claire, we'll just be—

1445
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:23,133
- l didn't sleep
with the babysitter,

1446
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,333
if that's what you're thinking.

1447
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,467
- Oh, that's so comforting.

1448
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:27,933
Why do we even have
a babysitter?

1449
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,233
- lt's just a kegger, Claire.

1450
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,333
That's all.

1451
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,600
- Just a kegger?

1452
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:35,067
And with whom exactIy
did you have a kegger?

1453
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,567
- Just some kids
from the high school.

1454
01:22:36,733 --> 01:22:38,000
- Richard, just stop.

1455
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:39,300
None of this is okay.

1456
01:22:39,467 --> 01:22:40,333
- Okay.

1457
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,467
- You knew we were
coming this weekend.

1458
01:22:42,633 --> 01:22:43,900
Why are you doing this?

1459
01:22:44,067 --> 01:22:46,533
- l've been at a bit of a loss.

1460
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:47,833
- That's a bullshit answer.

1461
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,300
- l've been floundering,

1462
01:22:49,467 --> 01:22:50,633
and Abby has been—

1463
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,467
- What?
Abby's been what?

1464
01:22:52,633 --> 01:22:54,067
- A friend.

1465
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,133
- For God's sake.

1466
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,500
That's not a friend;
that's a child.

1467
01:22:56,667 --> 01:22:58,467
You have friends.
- No, l don't

1468
01:22:58,633 --> 01:23:01,233
- Do think that was a chipmunk
that we hit?

1469
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,533
- l think they hibernate.
- Yeah.

1470
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,300
- 'Cause you don't know how
to relate to other human beings.

1471
01:23:06,467 --> 01:23:08,100
Yeah, you isolate yourself.

1472
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:09,233
- Oh, you could talk.

1473
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,333
- What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

1474
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,767
- You can be cold, Claire.

1475
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:14,700
- Let's just maybe
get out of here.

1476
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:16,600
Can we just get out of here?
Can we Ieave this area?

1477
01:23:16,767 --> 01:23:18,367
- What do you mean by that?

1478
01:23:18,533 --> 01:23:21,267
- l don't know
if it's your profession or what

1479
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:24,600
But it's made you hard.

1480
01:23:24,767 --> 01:23:25,833
- l can't—
l don't accept that

1481
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,433
- l wanted to have a baby.

1482
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,700
- Is that what
this is all about?

1483
01:23:30,867 --> 01:23:32,400
- We could have had a baby,
CIaire.

1484
01:23:32,567 --> 01:23:34,000
Why didn't we have a baby?

1485
01:23:34,167 --> 01:23:35,867
- Why?
Because you are a baby!

1486
01:23:36,067 --> 01:23:37,600
You're an infant

1487
01:23:37,767 --> 01:23:39,900
You still have
an imaginary friend.

1488
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,533
- l just wanted
a little warm thing,

1489
01:23:42,667 --> 01:23:44,533
something simple
I couId start with,

1490
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:48,433
a single relationship with
a person that was new and pure,

1491
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,000
where I couId be me
and they could be them,

1492
01:23:50,133 --> 01:23:51,667
and that was aII
that was expected.

1493
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,333
And we could build this world

1494
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,000
where there was someone else
other than me

1495
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:58,400
to think about and be about,

1496
01:23:58,567 --> 01:24:04,267
the relief of being able to give
the worId to someone eIse

1497
01:24:04,467 --> 01:24:06,400
and just let it be theirs,

1498
01:24:06,533 --> 01:24:09,200
let them have their turn,

1499
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,300
so it doesn't end with me.

1500
01:24:13,433 --> 01:24:14,800
- Well, that's all you.

1501
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:16,167
Where do l come in?

1502
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,367
- What do you mean?

1503
01:24:17,533 --> 01:24:20,133
God, you're the mother.

1504
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:24,667
- Uh, l'm so sorry, you guys.

1505
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,200
But we're gonna go.

1506
01:24:26,367 --> 01:24:27,433
We're just gonna go.

1507
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,267
- B&B just anywhere?

1508
01:24:29,433 --> 01:24:30,233
Anywhere.

1509
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,933
- l'm sorry.

1510
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,400
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1511
01:24:33,567 --> 01:24:35,133
- We're just gonna—
- Okay, l'll walk you out

1512
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,800
- We should all go on a cruise
or something.

1513
01:24:40,733 --> 01:24:42,367
- Okay.

1514
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,133
- Take care.

1515
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,633
- All right, if we're gonna do
this, let's—

1516
01:25:12,867 --> 01:25:15,467
all right, by the way,
what is she, like, 13, 14?

1517
01:25:15,633 --> 01:25:17,733
Let's at Ieast get
our facts straight, though.

1518
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,867
Okay, it was you, Richard.

1519
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,367
You didn't want to have a baby.

1520
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:22,400
You weren't ready.

1521
01:25:22,633 --> 01:25:24,933
So that little fuzzy
fucking speech

1522
01:25:25,067 --> 01:25:27,633
my friends had to hear
was bullshit

1523
01:25:27,733 --> 01:25:30,567
And now l'm—
l can't

1524
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,500
So l guess l'm the bad guy.

1525
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,600
- No, not the novel.

1526
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,600
Look, l'd rather you didn't—

1527
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:42,567
- What is this?

1528
01:25:42,733 --> 01:25:44,800
What is this?

1529
01:25:44,967 --> 01:25:46,233
- That's it

1530
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:48,800
- After all this time out here,

1531
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:50,000
this is it?

1532
01:25:50,167 --> 01:25:51,467
This?

1533
01:25:51,633 --> 01:25:53,667
Maybe if you'd spent
more time working

1534
01:25:53,867 --> 01:25:55,600
instead of fucking
the babysitter—

1535
01:25:55,767 --> 01:25:56,933
- No.

1536
01:25:57,067 --> 01:25:58,567
- You're useless.
- Yes.

1537
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,533
- You're totally useless.

1538
01:25:59,767 --> 01:26:01,067
- Yes, l am.

1539
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,300
- What is wrong with you?

1540
01:26:02,467 --> 01:26:07,733
- l don't know what to do
with my hands!

1541
01:26:15,033 --> 01:26:20,000
Jen and my sister
and Liv all envied me.

1542
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:22,500
l had the one who made me laugh.

1543
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:23,467
What happened?

1544
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,667
l don't know what happened.

1545
01:26:25,867 --> 01:26:27,800
- You stopped laughing.

1546
01:27:28,767 --> 01:27:30,700
- Help you?

1547
01:27:30,867 --> 01:27:33,467
- Yeah, l came to pay
my respects.

1548
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:34,667
- Sorry?

1549
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,500
- The heath hen,
the North American heath hen.

1550
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:38,800
This is where
the last one lived, died.

1551
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:40,433
- Oh.

1552
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,467
l wouldn't know anything
about a heath hen.

1553
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,367
But you're welcome
to Iook around.

1554
01:27:45,533 --> 01:27:47,500
We've got several varieties
of pIover.

1555
01:27:47,633 --> 01:27:50,233
- Thank you.

1556
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:16,000
So this is what the end
of something looks like.

1557
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:17,867
- The world went on, Richard.

1558
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,100
- But never the same.

1559
01:28:19,267 --> 01:28:20,733
Who knows how she might have
changed things

1560
01:28:20,867 --> 01:28:23,867
with herjust being here,
the rippIe effect

1561
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,233
- And if that chicken
hadn't died out,

1562
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,700
you'd be perfectly
well adjusted.

1563
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:27,667
- Maybe.

1564
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,967
- Doubtful.

1565
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:32,933
- Instead,
l'm a childless loser.

1566
01:28:33,067 --> 01:28:35,533
l'm condemned to oblivion,
Captain,

1567
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:37,233
just Iike our IittIe hen.

1568
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,400
lt's time for you to go.

1569
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:47,167
- No.

1570
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:50,633
- You know what l'm saying,
Captain.

1571
01:28:53,433 --> 01:28:57,667
I mean,
go and never come back.

1572
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,433
- l'm not ready.

1573
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:01,733
- lt doesn't matter.

1574
01:29:01,867 --> 01:29:06,667
You can't help me anymore.

1575
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,567
The doctor's right

1576
01:29:08,733 --> 01:29:10,167
- But you'll be all alone.

1577
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:12,300
- Yes.

1578
01:29:12,467 --> 01:29:14,400
Last of my kind.

1579
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:24,333
Okay.

1580
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:26,900
Do the voice

1581
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,933
one last time.

1582
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:35,100
Please.

1583
01:29:39,933 --> 01:29:43,967
- When the world is in peril,

1584
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:48,467
when evil surrounds you,

1585
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:51,033
when danger is lurking...

1586
01:29:55,467 --> 01:29:57,733
Who do you call?

1587
01:29:59,633 --> 01:30:02,267
- Captain Excellent

1588
01:31:29,867 --> 01:31:35,500
- I wish I had
a really amazing

1589
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,633
fucked-up father like him.

1590
01:32:05,433 --> 01:32:07,033
- Captain.

1591
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,700
Richmond regarded his solitude—

1592
01:32:17,867 --> 01:32:19,967
Merton regarded—
Horton regarded—

1593
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,733
Richmond?

1594
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,033
Richmond?

1595
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:44,433
Richard.

1596
01:32:55,200 --> 01:33:01,400
Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

1597
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:40,733
- l had this dream last night

1598
01:33:40,867 --> 01:33:44,133
And you were in it

1599
01:33:44,267 --> 01:33:46,533
- Oh, was l interesting?

1600
01:33:48,133 --> 01:33:50,033
- You were you.

1601
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,133
You're leaving, aren't you?

1602
01:33:57,467 --> 01:34:00,800
- Yeah, you know,

1603
01:34:00,933 --> 01:34:04,933
'cause of the situation.

1604
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:05,900
- Yeah.

1605
01:34:06,067 --> 01:34:08,167
l figured.

1606
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:18,400
You know,
spring is my favorite time,

1607
01:34:18,567 --> 01:34:21,067
'cause summer people
aren't here yet

1608
01:34:21,233 --> 01:34:24,267
lt's not so fucking cold.

1609
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,933
- Yeah.

1610
01:34:27,133 --> 01:34:32,000
Um, l made you something.

1611
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,200
- That's the swan.

1612
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,133
The beautiful, graceful swan.

1613
01:34:53,267 --> 01:34:57,533
It's—
Richard, it's perfect

1614
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,400
- Yeah, well...

1615
01:35:01,767 --> 01:35:04,167
- Thank you.

1616
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:12,233
- lt seems like we were
just getting started.

1617
01:35:17,433 --> 01:35:19,833

01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:35,600
Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred,

1637
01:38:35,767 --> 01:38:39,000
as a well-earned
badge of honor,

1638
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:42,233
a cloak to be worn
to ward off life,

1639
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,933
as his safety.

1640
01:38:45,133 --> 01:38:47,367
Solitude is who he was.

1641
01:38:47,533 --> 01:38:49,133
This caused those in his life

1642
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:52,067
to view him
with a barely veiled contempt.

1643
01:38:52,233 --> 01:38:54,633
Richard was certain
that he was not liked,

1644
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,300
which is hard on a man.

1645
01:38:56,467 --> 01:38:58,367
Maybe it was because
he gave nothing

1646
01:38:58,533 --> 01:39:00,600
that he received nothing
in return.

1647
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,933
ln any case, his situation
had become intolerable.

1648
01:39:05,067 --> 01:39:06,800
The closest things
he had to friends

1649
01:39:06,933 --> 01:39:09,267
were either imaginary
or extinct.

1650
01:39:09,433 --> 01:39:11,200
Richard had reached a point
in his life

1651
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:15,800
where this was no longer
enough.

1652
01:39:15,967 --> 01:39:18,733
And then he met a girl,

1653
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:22,400
and she was warm,
and she was sad,

1654
01:39:22,533 --> 01:39:24,133
and she was maybe lonely
in a way

1655
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,067
that reminded him of himself.

1656
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:31,533
She'd lost things that a girl
should never have lost.

1657
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:35,267
And she knew things,
and she taught him.

1658
01:39:35,433 --> 01:39:36,667
And Richard thought,

1659
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,933
"Maybe this is what friendship
feels like.

1660
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:46,333
Maybe."

1661
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,367
lt was just a glimpse.

1662
01:39:54,533 --> 01:39:58,000
They'd barely begun, really.

1663
01:40:01,267 --> 01:40:04,767
But in those long
few winter days,

1664
01:40:04,933 --> 01:40:08,433
she'd given him so much,

1665
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,600
enough so that Richard
could go on.

1666
01:40:18,033 --> 01:40:22,000
And what had he given her?

1667
01:40:22,133 --> 01:40:26,033
Just a few words on a page.

1668
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:30,467
Not much, perhaps.

1669
01:40:30,633 --> 01:40:35,200
But for Abby,
he hoped it was enough.
