1
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,983


2
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,858
Pictures didn't do any justice.

3
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,726
- I sense danger. - It's fine. I'm fine.

4
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,021
Were you car sick?

5
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,713
Of course I wasn't car sick.

6
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:55,757
That's why I ...

7
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,060
Richard, I'm not sure you fully understand

8
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,536
that you're walking into here, there are killness.

9
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:01,382
I know.

10
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:04,446
I can handle this. Would you please, just give me some credit.

11
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,794
It's not gonna be quiet.

12
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,115
I'm having trouble believing how great this is.

13
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:13,937
Are you coming?

14
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,253
Oh, good Lord!

15
00:03:16,491 --> 00:03:17,604
Claire?

16
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,573
Oh, poor thing.

17
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,906
At least it was quick.

18
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:24,233
It was a clean cut throat tear.

19
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,599
You should give him a proper burial.

20
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,796
I feel just like I lost my parents.

21
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:50,558
Oh, thanks.

22
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,819
Oh, this is charming.

23
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:15,282
All the wire works. Good.

24
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,398
I do not know if the stove works.

25
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:20,990
Maybe they have take-out menus.

26
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,642
Oh, listen! Come here, come here. Come here

27
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,422
There she is. The moan of sea.

28
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:28,789
Still in there.

29
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,828
Wow! Yeah.

30
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,816
That's so...

31
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,529
Oh, they got plenty of towels.

32
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:44,175
We didn't need to bring any.

33
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:45,432
Oh well ...

34
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:49,363
The fuse box is in the leaning closet, Richard.

35
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:58,485
Oh, star lights. Richard?

36
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:08,695
The couch. It could be a problem.

37
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:11,142
Do not fix it.

38
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:12,824
You're right.

39
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,944
- Wonderful! Everything. - Good okay

40
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:18,179
You want to grab the luggage out of the car?

41
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:20,740
I'll do it.

42
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:28,752
Phil Turley is very concerned, Claire, about the community's efforts

43
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:32,025
to protect the nesting ground.

44
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:33,818
So it should be.

45
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:36,878
Listen, I put all my numbers

46
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,509
on the top sheet of that memory pat by the telephone,

47
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,082
so if you wanna tear that off and tape it off somewhere.

48
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:44,929
I'm in surgery from nine until noon,

49
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:47,110
so I'll check you in after that. OK?

50
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,496
Great. Good

51
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:54,051
Are you sure you do not want rent a car?

52
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:56,135
Didn't they say there was a bike?

53
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:57,491
I think it's under the garage.

54
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:59,365
It's ten minutes to town. It's no big deal.

55
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:01,743
Okay. It is up to you.

56
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,381
So, what is your schedule look like for tomorrow?

57
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:12,804
I'll start at the very beginning.

58
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,536
It is a very good place to start.

59
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,035
Speaking of which ...

60
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,099
Close your eyes.

61
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:27,471
OK. Can open them.

62
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,980
- Oh! - Marc just got one of these.

63
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,691
He said a five-year-old could use it.

64
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,269
Richard, easy words.

65
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:39,298
Actually, I was thinking writing on the Corona.

66
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:42,624
- Oh! - No, but this is good.

67
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,719
This is ...no, you're right. This is... This is better.

68
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:49,507
Okay.

69
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,845
Richard? Easy to handle this

70
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:17,203
Oh, I talked to Peter and Lucy

71
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,006
and they said they might come out the weekend the second.

72
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,739
Great, great!

73
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:25,213
- Who? - Peter and Lucy?

74
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,122
Oh, good, yeah. They are always fun.

75
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:29,955
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,050
You didn't bring... You didn't um... bring him out here, did you?

77
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,960
What? No. No, of course not.

78
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,347
Okay.

79
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,006
All right

80
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,872
Have a productive week, OK?

81
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:57,193
Save some lives!

82
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,598
R-No Pressure Love, C

83
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,708
- Any news? - Let go of me.

84
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,166
Do you remember the time you and I we took a neighbor's bicycle

85
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:16,667
a little fluph?

86
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,787
No, I do not. No. Will you let me go?

87
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:21,587
We both know that I'm not gonna quit the deal under these circumstances

88
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:25,057
until you prove otherwise I feel compelled to be on hands.

89
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,995
Can you step aside? I have things to do.

90
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,748
I sense danger.

91
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:29,789
Would you stop saying that.

92
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,867
Be careful!

93
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,217
Aren't you a cheerleader, anyway?

94
00:10:04,684 --> 00:10:05,768
I'm not.

95
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:29,823
You can so easy to be a cheerleader.

96
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:31,585
You can so easily drop dead.

97
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:30,830
Oh!

98
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:10,164
No! No! Not like that.

99
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,043
Hands soap? Oh!

100
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,006
No. It's for your wheels.

101
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,831
The squeak drives me nuts.

102
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:22,082
It's a nice bike, though.

103
00:12:22,254 --> 00:12:24,015
Used to have one of these when I was young age.

104
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,655
So, how com you following me?

105
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:37,281
I'm not.

106
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:40,556
- Are to! - I'm not, I'm not.

107
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:42,488
Are to! How come?

108
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:46,658
Well, I ...I kind of ur...  I just I moved in the town

109
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:50,343
and I need ... uh ... a babysiter.

110
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:56,531
I just thought you know maybe you ...you ...you uh might know somebody who

111
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:57,915
Yeah Okay.

112
00:12:57,998 --> 00:12:59,301
When do you need me for?

113
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,157
Oh!

114
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,821
Friday ...

115
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:05,330

116
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:06,865
six ...

117
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:09,695
Address and phone number?

118
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,358
18 Sag Harbor Road.

119
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:14,454
I don't know the phone number yet.

120
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:15,612
Sorry.

121
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,637
All right. I'll see you Friday.

122
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,425
I'm Mr. .. I'm Richard.

123
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:44,110
Merton regarded his solitude as something sacred.

124
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:52,502
Merton regarded his solitude as something s...

125
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:29,174
Face it. You can't live without me.

126
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:30,270
Do you mind?

127
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,939
I am communing with nature here.

128
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,015
Why are you so incapable of believing

129
00:14:34,016 --> 00:14:35,892
I can do things perfectly fine on my own?

130
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:37,657
Becuse you never have.

131
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,334
Excuse me?

132
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:40,478
Oh! Richard, Richard, Richard.

133
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,088
How many times, huh? How many times?

134
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:46,311
- I'm not gonna go through these ballet lessons alone. - Do not mock me.

135
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:49,672
I'm gonna like go through the college year, like, alone.

136
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,004
Okay, That

137
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,461
You konw I do not need you, Captain.

138
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,950
I'll resurrect my half-dead marriage alone.

139
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:56,387
Please, it's totally stupid!

140
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:57,652
I can't leave you to do it alone!

141
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,199
Okay, good day, sir!

142
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,748
A good day!

143
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,745
Oh, my God!

144
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:14,467
Merton regarded his solitude as something sacred.

145
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,134
Merton? Burton? Milton? Milton!

146
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,817
Milton regarded his solitude as something sacred.

147
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:32,699
Hey, sorry.

148
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,891
- I'm a little bit early.  - No no

149
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,327
No problem.  Sorry, I ...I... 

150
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,740
- I forgot your name. - Oh, that's okay.

151
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:40,268
I forgot yours' too.

152
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:43,694
But I was thinking it was Paul, or Steve

153
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:45,615
or Dave ... maybe?

154
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:49,486
- Richard.  - Oh, OK, that works.

155
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,238
Oh, here!

156
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,717
It's ... uh ... it's a lovelot... for the kid

157
00:16:08,771 --> 00:16:12,455
Oh well ... actually ...

158
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,308
So, you just moved here?

159
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,875
Where are you from?

160
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,509
Uh ... just ... just ...

161
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:19,842
- In the city. - Oh!

162
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,708
Yeah. It's only temporary.

163
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,662
My wife Claire is New York Presbyterian.

164
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,390
She's vascular surgeon.

165
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:27,147
Oh, wow!

166
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:30,114
Is that her? She's cute.

167
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,265
Oh, yeah, that's the Doctor.

168
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:36,016
My parents went through sepration too, you know?

169
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,512
What? Oh, no, no no.

170
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,911
That is not what is happening here.

171
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,769
No, that's... no that's....

172
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:43,994
No, isn't it?

173
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:46,527
Well, you should probably find out.

174
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,076
Is it sleeping?

175
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,803
Uh, the baby?

176
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:53,893
Ah ...the thing about that baby.

177
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:55,349
Are you thirsty?

178
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:56,619
Oh, no.

179
00:16:57,377 --> 00:17:01,820
Look ... the baby ...the baby is not ... here.

180
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:04,250
What do you mean?

181
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:09,169
Basically, I guess ... uh ... There is no baby.

182
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,342
As such.

183
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,036
Is there no kid?

184
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:15,306
No.

185
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,129
Well ..

186
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,369
Sure then it will be easier.

187
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:24,776
So ...

188
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:26,470
When you think you will be home?

189
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:29,830
Oh, nine ...  nine thirty?

190
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:32,056
Okay, I got a lot of homework.

191
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,371
So ... have fun.

192
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:49,656
OK.

193
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:22,440
Chicken Shit!

194
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:38,799
Gerhard dunn Renderer

195
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:41,710
richard dunn

196
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,309
Self-floating is a underrated form of psychological

197
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,500
checks in balances.

198
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:58,720
Never too high, never too low.

199
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:02,693
Thought Mirton do it himself investigating in the rate of repeating breath work

200
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,413
Jesus.

201
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,623
- Don't say it. - Say what?

202
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:28,043
- I know what you're thinking. - No. You don't

203
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,867
I was thinking about pantaloons.

204
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:47,284
- What are you doing? - You ass!

205
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:48,960
How did you get in here?

206
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:50,172
The door was open.

207
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,217
What is extremely unsafe, by the way.

208
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:54,241
You do not need to keep checking up on me.

209
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,017
Is this the guy who was was following you?

210
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:57,107
Who does that?

211
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,389
You do.I am just a babysitter.

212
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:01,472
Where is the child?

213
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,851
He dosen't have one child.

214
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:08,448
Abby, this guy is a pervert. We got to get out of here now.

215
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,534
He is a famous writer, right?

216
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:11,706
Get a life?

217
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:13,923
You're my life.

218
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,128
You got a problem with me

219
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:30,993
No. I don't get a problem with you.

220
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,491
And Bryce? - What about him?

221
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,015
-He treats you like a shit.- When?

222
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:35,416
Always.  - No.

223
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,011
-Yes.  - Shut up.

224
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:49,759
Oh, you're not.- not about what?

225
00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:52,480
What are you doing?- Making soup.

226
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:54,911
You've know this stocker guy for five minutes

227
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:56,364
you're already making him soup?

228
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,510
I told you, Christopher,he is a writer.

229
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:03,885
I love you.

230
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:08,782
What are you doing out here?

231
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:10,465
I told her nine, nine thirty.

232
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:14,213
No. I want to know what are you doing out here with the girl?

233
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:15,326
Nothing.

234
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,377
It doesn't strick you as odd,somehow?

235
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,939
A babysitter?

236
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:22,132
I am under a lot of pressure, OK? I have to produce.

237
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,300
People expect literature.

238
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:27,068
The doctor my publisher.I have got three months

239
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,780
for three months create this thing.

240
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:30,168
The girl helped how?

241
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,013
Was I popular in high school?

242
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:33,863
In right respects?

243
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,361
And the girl helps how?

244
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:37,575
You have to question every decision I take?

245
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,642
Make better decisions.

246
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:40,524
Just do the boys.

247
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:45,007
Oh! Oh, no! He needs me.

248
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,091
At the juncture, yeah.- juncture?

249
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:49,135
Yes.

250
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:50,695
-oh  - just do it

251
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:07,322
When the world is in peril.

252
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,668
When evil is around you.

253
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:14,842
When danger is lurking.

254
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:16,870
Who do you call?

255
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:22,476
Captain Excellent!

256
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,244
I am a poster!

257
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:48,999
There is something out there in the woods.

258
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:50,954
Oh, my God!

259
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:52,711
The wolf?

260
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:53,782
Did not you hear?

261
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:55,189
He escaped from the zoo this morning.

262
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,502
There is a zoo here?

263
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:01,171
no it's just...oh...

264
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:05,111
Whatever it is, I won't let it get you.

265
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,093
Wanna soup?

266
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:09,951
What?

267
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,613
Yeah. I made soup.

268
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,252
I thought that you maybe cold.

269
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,211
What did you do tonight?

270
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,184
I went to the shore and did some thinking.

271
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,707
For three hours? In freezing cold?

272
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:32,106
You made this?

273
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:33,150
Yeah

274
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:36,264
-How?  - I do not know.

275
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:41,784
A couple of carrots, and onion,one of your beers ...

276
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:45,579
Oh, I hope that's OK. I just can't help myself

277
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:50,630
No, it's fantastic.- You have not even tasted it yet.

278
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,584
No, no. I mean, I mean ...

279
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:55,908
The fact of it... is fantastic that you made something

280
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,396
from nothing.

281
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,388
Oh, you can ... you can ...you know

282
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:01,218
kind of make soup out of anything.

283
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,607
That's the great thing about it.

284
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:07,344
just whatever left things around, you know

285
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:11,518
you can take all the crap that's surrounding in your frige and

286
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,102
you can do it up that you can touch to the part you can make soup better

287
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:17,803
I go with a soup.

288
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:23,548
Oh, it's superb!

289
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:26,637
Thank you.

290
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:28,103
No.really!

291
00:24:28,188 --> 00:24:30,739
It's... excellent.

292
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:32,954
Do you remember the moment that you realized

293
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:35,532
the soup did not have to come out of a can?

294
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,289
you've got manufactured

295
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:41,624
Your chicken noodles can kick Campbell  noodles' ass any day all week

296
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,198
I think I'm having that moment right now.

297
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:50,730
Plus, it is very nutritious which which is good.

298
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:05,927
What uh... what happened there?

299
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:07,822
Oh, sorry ... uh ...

300
00:25:08,348 --> 00:25:10,523
It's just a boyfriend thing.

301
00:25:14,674 --> 00:25:16,980
This bird kind of reminds me of him.

302
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,468
He's chicken shit.

303
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:23,091
Actually it's not a chicken.

304
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:24,711
It's a North America Heath Hen

305
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:28,108
Relative of great perit chicken, but not technically a chicken.

306
00:25:29,618 --> 00:25:30,853
It's extinct now.

307
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:34,895
The last few lived out here out of the nature preserve

308
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,302
I do not know that.

309
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:40,201
I am not a birder or anything,

310
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:43,945
it just the the last surviving heath hen is a character ...

311
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:47,572
-in uh...   -In what?

312
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,907
This bird is the main character of this book ...you know

313
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,907
I'm attempting to produce.

314
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:54,498
Uh ... write...

315
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:56,892
Finish.

316
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:59,468
Actually to start.

317
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:06,570
Saying it out loud, just sound kind of stupid.

318
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:10,889
Well, there is... there's Chicken Little.

319
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:14,196
You know, little red hen?

320
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,588
Henny Penny?- Yeah, exactly.

321
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:17,812
Exactly.

322
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,558
There are lots of books out there about um ...

323
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:24,686
poetry.

324
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,416
We should settle up- Okay.

325
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:41,663
-Is that about right? - Actually ... uh ...

326
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,901
I am twelve an hour.- Oh, okay.

327
00:26:47,852 --> 00:26:50,166
I only have a ten. Do you have change?

328
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,698
Oh Let me check.

329
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:56,111
How come your boyfriend's a  chicken shit?

330
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,484
Not my business, so ...

331
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,478
No.He just ...

332
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,347
He is a bug, you know, it's like when when he's with me he is all

333
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:12,997
you know when he's with friends he's all... 

334
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,688
whatever he's a fucking chicken shit

335
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:21,943
-Right.  - Uh, okay, so ...

336
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:25,054
-Thank you.  - Thank you.

337
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:35,513
Can I ask you a quick question?

338
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,637
Sure.

339
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:42,001
Is this couch make me look fat?

340
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:43,421
I wouldn't sit there.

341
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:47,358
So, okay, uh ...

342
00:27:47,552 --> 00:27:50,070
Good luck with the chicken book .

343
00:27:55,781 --> 00:27:57,393
Same time next week?

344
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:04,643
Okay.

345
00:28:05,932 --> 00:28:07,925
You didn't tell me your name.

346
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:21,580
Richard?

347
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,083
Richard?

348
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,311
Are we separated?

349
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:33,884
What?

350
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:36,467
Is this a trail of separation what are we doing?

351
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,699
What makes you think that?

352
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:42,215
I do not know. Are we separating?

353
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:45,672
Sweetness, if we were in separating

354
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,275
you'll be the first to know.

355
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,446
I guess.

356
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,243
Well we don't have to discuss.

357
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:52,611
Trust me.

358
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:56,513
Okay.

359
00:28:57,891 --> 00:28:58,958
Good

360
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:05,474
It Just moved

361
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:11,339
well, that is not possible. It's been boiled.

362
00:29:11,643 --> 00:29:12,758
To death.

363
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,271
Poor little Loui

364
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:16,618
Well don't name it, Richard.

365
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,293
I mean ... do whatever you want.

366
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,526
No, don't don't name your food.

367
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:23,566
Here

368
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:25,290
Oh!

369
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:33,814
Here. Right?

370
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:42,307
Uhm? Go.

371
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:44,938
Uhm?

372
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:49,190
If only everything in the world could be coverd in butter,

373
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:52,581
what world that will be?

374
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:54,133
I guess.

375
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:03,008
What a buttery world .

376
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,637

378
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:25,283
So, what does the rendered world render?

Well, let me know.

I'm sure there's something brilliant.

382
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:35,622
What were you doing in my gym class?

383
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:36,861
Nothing.

384
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,995
You think I didn't see you?

385
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:40,531
I was just there for more support.

386
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:43,315
-I am sick of volleyball. - you do not

387
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:46,885
-I'm sick of everything. - No,you don't.

388
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,892

00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:52,035
Shut up.

390
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:58,398
-I never go out anymore.- You gonna leave,OK?

391
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:01,074
I'm meeting Bryce later.

392
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:05,989
He's beneath you know.

393
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,220
Well you gonna lose some shit

394
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:27,035
It's freezing in here. Run the heater

395
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:29,098
You want to pay for the gas?

396
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,511
Are you done?

397

402
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,206
I do not know how to do this all day. I mean, there's so much pressure.

403
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:52,033
-That's just a game. - I know.

404
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,216
Nobody dies here.

405
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:55,578
-Go ahead, please. - Can we play something else.

406
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:57,777

Have a productive week and I will see you on the 15th .

411
00:33:25,676 --> 00:33:26,719
Yes.

412
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:46,170
What?

413
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,009
Why are you standing?

414
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:52,673
Oh!

415
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,614
-Really?  -Really.

416
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:59,638
Ohh!

417
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,852
Well, it's like that

418
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:12,448
You don't want to stuck that dime out because it smells like you your mouth

419
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,910
The cowboy outfit for your 7th great book picture.

420
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:17,314
Remember? The horny tart? The huger strike?

421
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,232
Of course you're against those decisions.

422
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,039
Because if you didn't listen to me it's just fine

423
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,090
you were just a kid.

424
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,428
Now it's grow up time.

425
00:34:28,097 --> 00:34:31,162
Babysiter? Bad, Richard.

426
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,638
very, very bad, Richard.

427
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:35,915
The chairs can be a problem.

428
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:38,590
Six. A lot

429
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:42,926
Making the monkey

430
00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:47,046
A humorous monkey is popular in the zoological garderns

431
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,740
For example:

432
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:51,021
It's lovely that you make a baby mokey

433
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,537
with a small paper

434
00:34:52,587 --> 00:34:54,767
and you put it on the mother monkey.

435
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:08,990
Fold a top right corner.

436
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:15,136
Why origami? Why now?

437
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,321
I need something to do with my hands.

438
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:21,883
I have the trouble in telling which is the monkey and which is the swan?

439
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,135
- Can't be all of them? - Oh, no.

440
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:35,763
There's much more on the truck.

441
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,835
Oh, great. Start bring them in.

442
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:51,784
Horton ...

443
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,956
Richard, for the love of God, Do not do this, please.

444
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:03,668
Listen to me you're going to make a huge mistake

445
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,357
You're going forward?

446
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,764
It's Abby... my name

447
00:36:28,712 --> 00:36:32,247
- Oh, you got rid of the couch. - Yeah, the couch was a problem.

448
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,711
This is for you.

449
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:40,899
Oh! It's a ...

450
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,987
Let's see ...

451
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:45,559
It is a fish.

452
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:46,862
A dead fish.

453
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,025
- Of all dead fish. - Yeah.

454
00:36:50,629 --> 00:36:53,381
My dad fishes, make for a living

455
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:55,515
It is a fluke

456
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:56,216
In what sense?

457
00:36:56,871 --> 00:36:58,872
It is called a fluke.

458
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,576
The water around here, something like that

459
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,774
So is eatable?

460
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:05,517
Yeah

461
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:10,571
A fluke is uh... that's great. Thanks.

462
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:18,687
So I um I read that book you wrote

463
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,838
I hope that's OK?

464
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,703
Reading my book, of course.

465
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,668
You may be one of the few, but ...

466
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:29,659
So you're out tonight? On the town?

467
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:31,285
I do not know.

468
00:37:31,353 --> 00:37:33,253
What the people of Montauk do on a Friday night you know

469
00:37:34,646 --> 00:37:36,529
The yards are totally dance.

470
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,631
So, you probably like that

471
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:42,566
It's uh down by the harbour You can't not miss.

472
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,836
What did you think of the uh... ... the book?

473
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:48,750

got its moments ...

477
00:37:58,427 --> 00:37:59,696
I hate it.

478
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,655
You should probably by that fish in the frige

479
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,099
It's little stink of the whole house

480
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:11,264
Trust me, I know.

481

Soup ingredients .

483
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:30,607
You know, if you feel like it.

484

You bought me a turnip?

485
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:39,962
You're making it silly me.

486
00:38:40,645 --> 00:38:42,961
Well, I can sell if you don't feel like it

487
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,286
No pressure.

488
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,917
Your book was cool actually

489
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:00,082
Kind of blew me away

490
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:28,236
- Want uh... have something to eat? - Thanks no.

That's the one

504
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:21,000
My wife invented and patterned a life-saving

505
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,272
polarimeter shunt.

506
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,554
- Song, you say? - Song.

507
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,165
So there is a heath hen

508
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:41,279
hunker down the campion.

509
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:42,585
- Just down the road here.  - Yep.

510
00:40:42,705 --> 00:40:43,857
As game warrent.

511
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:45,403
The Alfred guy.

512
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,292
Yeah it could at correct Alfred is the actual name

513
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:51,220
In the book I'm going to call him Horton or ... Morton.

514
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:54,870
Anyway, he's brought his flock of heath hens,

515
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:57,134
back from the brink of extinction.

516
00:40:57,216 --> 00:40:58,357
Possible

517
00:40:58,452 --> 00:41:02,188
I mean he was down to eleventh o'clock  I say eleven you know. But now with care

518
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,712
and then I say a love and now he's got two hundred.

519
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:09,635
- You konw it's like the hen is saved. - Sage, Thank God.

520
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:11,910
But because the story is a tragedy,

521
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:13,081
You know what happen?

522
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,417
- What? - Fire.

523
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:17,047
- No Come on!  - Yes, it sweeps accross preserved.

524
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:21,231
Of course the heath hens are not nature's most intelligent bird to begin with.

525
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:26,331
They are just sitting there you know... They never sense to run or fly

526
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:30,905
while You know, when the fire runs out there're just five birds remained.

527
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,837
Roast chickens.

528
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:39,544
What happens to the five?

529
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,169
They dwindle you know they dwindle

530
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,854
till there's just one left you know

531
00:41:49,404 --> 00:41:53,629
Just one... this one poor...  stupid little thing, you know, just a stupid bird... just one

532
00:42:07,056 --> 00:42:08,620
It is a true story

533
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,465
Go to hunt for my friend here, Mike.

534
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:33,191
Chicken shit.

535
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,964
Oh, you did make soup. Bless your heart!

536
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:06,989
Just a small act of great kindness, but I can't tell you

537
00:43:07,076 --> 00:43:08,395
what it means to me.

538
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:11,446
Well, it's no big deal. It's just a soup

539
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:15,616
You are such a beautiful girl

540
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:18,507
You are such a beautiful child

541
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,794
- You're loaded - No, no ... I well, yes.

542
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,556
Okay, I s hould go. As you're today a little longer... 

543
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:28,692

544
00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:30,217

00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,798
- This is who I am. - What?

546
00:43:32,882 --> 00:43:37,362
I am the only child of only child the only child.

547
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:38,979
You know what that means?

548
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:40,550
No cousins?

549
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:43,473
It means I am the end of bloodline

550
00:43:43,711 --> 00:43:45,701
The last of my kind.

551
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:47,982
OK, well, then have some kids

552
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:50,458

553
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,196
Ahh, if you want to know how... 

554

She's a machine doesn't break.

560
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:15,255
like a rock factory

561
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,654
So how are you going to creat life for you know it's gonna to end up and down

She does not realize that Human beings are warm.

00:44:39,714 --> 00:44:41,557

You know a funny thing about soup?

596
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:21,384

602
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:41,063
Oh, well thank you for your concern, Claire.

603
00:47:41,964 --> 00:47:43,991
Speaking of how are your patients?

604
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:46,142
Are they doing well?

605
00:47:47,023 --> 00:47:50,491
And what's some of their names?

606
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:54,641

Oh well you know... beaten well my life you know... 

608
00:47:57,602 --> 00:47:59,363
Winds of change.

Anyway I want to do unloading of boxes

610
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,359
If you don't want to have a pitch in so you would then grab some brunch

611
00:48:12,644 --> 00:48:15,252

Why? Why would you do that to yourself?

614
00:48:20,007 --> 00:48:22,768
Well, I'm emarking on writing of my second life

615
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:28,303
much anticipated second novel It should be the reminder of the remarkable

616
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,750
I mean quite noble failure of my first novel didn't sell any copies  whatsoeve

617
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:34,480
Richard, I can't go down the throat with you

618
00:48:34,853 --> 00:48:37,110
Oh, no, no, no. It's going to be rather motivational really

619
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:56,143
- That was smooth - Hey, I got to proven

620

- Wait, wait, wait. - What?

621
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,409
My super-senses are telling me something.

622
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,453
What?

623
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:03,247
Yes,I think the Dr.may be on to you.

624
00:49:03,343 --> 00:49:04,516
Shut your mouth up.

625
00:49:04,615 --> 00:49:06,075
Knock, knock. Who's that?

626
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:13,508
Shit! What do you want?

627
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:17,559
I came to see if you are OK.

628
00:49:17,946 --> 00:49:19,772
- Because your head was a...- It's fine, I'm fine.

629
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:21,209
You need to go now.

630
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:22,367
What?

631
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:24,175
You need to go now.

632
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,813
Screw you too.

633
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,567
And you were the one who came up to me

634
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:30,952
by the way.

635
00:49:32,965 --> 00:49:34,038
What?

636
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:35,870
Last night.

637
00:49:36,739 --> 00:49:38,697
Asshole. I just wanted to apologize.

638
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:41,723
For hitting you, but forget it, creep.

639
00:49:43,754 --> 00:49:45,573
Wait! Abby

640
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:49,555
The Dr.'s out of shower. And voila.

641
00:49:51,203 --> 00:49:55,974
- Richard, who was that? - Girl scout.

642
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:57,463
Girl scout.

643
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,267
Oh, okay.

644
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:10,719
Horton regarded his solitude as something sacred.

645
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:16,895
Horton? Norton? Norwood? Norwood!

646
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:20,403
Norwood regarded his solitude ... Oh!

647
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,495
How's it coming?

648
00:50:39,473 --> 00:50:41,974
Norwood regarded his solitude as something ...

649
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:50,942
Richard, what's this?

650
00:50:52,106 --> 00:50:53,290
The fluke.

651
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,384
-In what way? - The fish is called a fluke.

652
00:50:56,484 --> 00:50:58,276
The water around here is swimming with them.

653
00:50:58,436 --> 00:51:01,143
Oh! And what are we planning on doing with it?

654
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,445
I have to have a plan,

655
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,759
can I just have a fish in the house?

656
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:07,465
Yes, fine.I 'm Sorry.

657
00:51:07,554 --> 00:51:08,920
I thought we could cook it.

658
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:10,594
And then eat it.How was that?

659
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:14,080
I guess i just hadn't caught up with the fact that you are a cook now.

660
00:51:57,272 --> 00:51:58,532
Okay, stop, stop it,

661
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,737
you could stop it, please.Stop now.

662
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:03,563
Stop, stop it, stop please!

663
00:52:03,564 --> 00:52:04,606
Stop!

664
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,877
Abby!

665
00:52:39,517 --> 00:52:40,823
Who the hell is that?

666
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:51,030
I don't think i got a chance to pay you the other night.

667
00:52:51,228 --> 00:52:52,920
- How...is sixty. - Keep it.

668
00:52:53,025 --> 00:52:54,671
You don't even have a kid, so ...

669
00:52:57,322 --> 00:53:00,325
I think there was a kind of misunderstanding or something about my actions,

670
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:03,797
my intentions, pretty sure, sense or something.

671
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:06,448
Whatever. I'm sure you're sorry to it,so let so.

672
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:09,402
I'm not sorry, actually about all that.

673
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,752
I'm sorry about that I was so abrupt at the

674
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:13,613
- House ...- Your wife was there.

675
00:53:13,744 --> 00:53:16,385
- Yeah, I figured that out.- Yes.

676
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:20,220
- It would be awkward, you know?  - No, actually I don't know.

677
00:53:20,404 --> 00:53:24,235
Well, Claire wouldn't really understand our ...

678
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,986
Our what?

679
00:53:30,362 --> 00:53:31,689
Our friendship.

680
00:53:37,816 --> 00:53:38,892
Abby!

681
00:53:39,242 --> 00:53:40,634
Come on! We're out here.

682
00:53:40,732 --> 00:53:45,855
Anyway, I want to let you knew I respect you.

683
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,284
Is that the chickenshit?

684
00:53:51,794 --> 00:53:53,536
- Yeah - It's a good-looking guy.

685
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:55,214
Yeah, he sure think so.

686
00:53:57,024 --> 00:54:00,318
Are you coming or what?  We gonna to Texas.

687
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,026
- Yeah,Just a minute. - I'm Richard.

688
00:54:03,804 --> 00:54:06,519
Look, you said you wanna hanging out when you were not out.

689
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,993
It's Okay, Abby.I don't wanna keep you from a new day

690
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:12,530
Who's your friend with bike?

691
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:16,914
Abby has been babysitting for me. How's Wednesday night?

692
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:19,985
Sure.

693
00:54:21,353 --> 00:54:23,202
Damn, girl! Move your ass!

694
00:54:26,894 --> 00:54:27,978
Sorry.

695
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:31,972
He was following you here?

696
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:53,328
Richard?

697
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:05,999
- Richard, are you here? - I'll be right there.

698
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:10,240
Do not.

699
00:55:14,948 --> 00:55:16,708
Hey.How are you doing?

700
00:55:16,902 --> 00:55:19,531
- Come on, I wanna show you something.- Great! Okay.

701
00:55:27,506 --> 00:55:29,495
I have a problem with my hands.

702
00:55:30,743 --> 00:55:31,886
What do you mean?

703
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:33,988
They won't do what I want them to do.

704
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:36,803
What do you want them to do?

705
00:55:36,888 --> 00:55:38,520
Anything. I do not know.

706
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,878
Something useful.

707
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:42,302
I want them to build something or ...

708
00:55:42,364 --> 00:55:43,502
make something.

709
00:55:43,504 --> 00:55:44,595
Like what?

710
00:55:44,923 --> 00:55:47,656
Even Jesus, I mean if he was a carpenter.

711
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,327
It was not enough to save mankind

712
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:51,762
he needed a tray.

713
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:55,854
I am a flimsy man and insubstancial.

714
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:58,409
Well, compared to Jesus ...

715
00:55:58,886 --> 00:56:02,807
- I am a paper man.- No, you're a writer.

716
00:56:03,131 --> 00:56:06,780
- Yeah, that's crucial. - Yeah, it is.

717
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:12,581
Here we are.

718
00:56:13,943 --> 00:56:15,149
Where?

719
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:19,136
It is possible, so is sea

720
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:22,681
life and land with certain decries,

721
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:25,011
quietly was never see other again

722
00:56:26,355 --> 00:56:28,060
Did I write that? I wrote that.

723
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,051
Hold this.

724
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,280
Abby?

725
00:56:46,022 --> 00:56:47,137
Abby?

726
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:49,941
Abby?

727
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:56,277
Come on!

728
00:56:57,284 --> 00:56:58,364
Abby?

729
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,166
Abby?

730
00:57:07,046 --> 00:57:08,854
Jesus!What are you doing?

731
00:57:10,926 --> 00:57:12,039
What are you doing?

732
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:25,919
You can not do this.

733
00:57:26,662 --> 00:57:27,885
Can't do that.

734
00:57:46,155 --> 00:57:50,431
It was me that daren't going.

735
00:57:55,278 --> 00:57:56,753
It was really cold.

736
00:57:58,872 --> 00:58:02,229
It was much, much colder than today, but ...

737
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:05,776
You know, she wasn't gonna turn down the dare.

738
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,819
You will like that

739
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:14,689
And I woudln't be neither adventuress, so...

740
00:58:17,636 --> 00:58:19,493
I do not know why she went in.

741
00:58:20,743 --> 00:58:22,405
In her cloths. ..

742
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:26,692
I guess it maybe sort of warmer.

743
00:58:36,348 --> 00:58:38,141
And she was laughing.

744
00:58:42,692 --> 00:58:44,026
And you know.

745
00:58:47,178 --> 00:58:48,428
Fine.

746
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:50,141
And she was..Um...

747
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:54,387
And she was calm.

748
00:58:57,573 --> 00:59:00,821
Just under

749
00:59:00,822 --> 00:59:04,611
and gone and. ..

750
00:59:08,155 --> 00:59:09,767
I just stood there.

751
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,531
And in a couple of hours my mom came.

752
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:20,313
And found me and I guess, you know.

753
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,326
as waiting for her to swim back in, but ...

754
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:29,007
she never did.

755
00:59:31,257 --> 00:59:32,532
How old?

756
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,735
Same just with me.

757
00:59:35,985 --> 00:59:37,190
We were twins.

758
00:59:37,678 --> 00:59:41,887
Oh! Oh, my God!

759
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:44,868
That was a long time ago.

760
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:50,328
I'd like to go out there every year. Swim back to shore.

761
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:54,072
You know, I like to feel the cold.

762
00:59:56,967 --> 01:00:01,331
You must have...I don't know what to say.

763
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:08,108
So we were both only children.

764
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,781
That was our fate.

765
01:00:28,114 --> 01:00:30,121
Every year, and you knew it.

766
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:33,744
And you take that guy out there.

767
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:37,173
On this day.

768
01:00:38,861 --> 01:00:40,369
He didn't even know her.

769
01:00:41,782 --> 01:00:42,843
I know.

770
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,321
Remember when I was the only one who talked to you?

771
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:48,610
For a long time.

772
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,988
I know, but ...

773
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:52,686
He doesn't love you.

774
01:00:54,606 --> 01:00:56,399
That's your think you're wrong.

775
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,193
What do you want me to say?

776
01:00:58,416 --> 01:01:00,474
I gotta some move to California.

777
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,829
Shouldn't just assume my always being around

778
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:06,390
because one day ... Maybe I won't.

779
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:08,713
God! Stop it.

780
01:01:10,244 --> 01:01:11,635
Is this what you want?

781
01:01:20,627 --> 01:01:22,627
I don't have much history, do I?

782
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:24,476
That is relative visible.

783
01:01:24,842 --> 01:01:25,884
Exactly.

784
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,720
Other people seem to have revise.

785
01:01:29,063 --> 01:01:30,502
Things happen to them.

786
01:01:30,611 --> 01:01:31,914
Life all turn in occurrences.

787
01:01:32,521 --> 01:01:33,871
I used to do things.

788
01:01:34,803 --> 01:01:36,706
-Remember? -This is not about you.

789
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:39,505
Amazing things.

790
01:01:41,713 --> 01:01:42,948
What do you want me to say?

791
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,067
I don't know.

792
01:01:44,262 --> 01:01:47,899
No, no. Tell me what you want me to say literally,

793
01:01:47,947 --> 01:01:49,819
because frankly poorly I got nothing.

794
01:01:51,843 --> 01:01:52,917
Come here.

795
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:00,818
But you have to touch civilizers,

796
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:02,184
Richard,through your work

797
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:04,727
thought about your happiness be the happiness you brought to her biz.

798
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:19,417
Hey,um,look!

799
01:02:19,418 --> 01:02:21,396
It's the fundraiser for the children in hospital tomorrow night

800
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,492
and I am thinking of donating

801
01:02:24,493 --> 01:02:27,212
that bottle of wine, the 1971 Chateau Petrus .

802
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:29,550
I know I was saving up for a special occasion,

803
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,427
but what for that cost? So ...What do you think?

804
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,173
Richard, did you drink that wine?

805
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:42,234
That five-thousand-dollar bottle of wine

806
01:02:42,303 --> 01:02:44,956
It's not the raft. It was for the children.

807
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,958
Will you can call me, please?

808
01:02:54,886 --> 01:02:55,969
Come in!

809
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:05,925
- Wow, check out the couch!- Yeah,You like it?

810
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:10,078
- I made it with these.- Alright!

811
01:03:10,276 --> 01:03:12,545
- That's awesome!- Yeah, sit, sit, sit.

812
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:20,254
It's nice.

813
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:24,237
Oh, the ideas for titles.

814
01:03:25,428 --> 01:03:26,482
For your new book?

815
01:03:27,088 --> 01:03:28,331
Cool, what do you got?

816
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:36,441
Cloud escape. Death and Desolation.

817
01:03:37,971 --> 01:03:42,924
Daffodil. Memoirs of an Amnestic.

818
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:47,841
- Bolero  - Bolero?

819
01:03:47,842 --> 01:03:48,885
Okay.

820
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:50,645
Ad nauseum?

821
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:52,371
Almost Silence.

822
01:03:52,372 --> 01:03:53,431
No?

823
01:03:53,547 --> 01:03:55,583
Pictures of a Blackberry Wine.

824
01:03:55,796 --> 01:03:59,997
Let's forget it.Titles are impossible.

825
01:04:02,694 --> 01:04:03,940
Paper Man.

826
01:04:28,914 --> 01:04:31,149
You seem a lot more interesting than me.

827
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:34,137
I'm not.

828
01:04:34,343 --> 01:04:36,544
Just seems like that way because I have a dead sister.

829
01:04:38,566 --> 01:04:40,885
- Where have you been all day? - I do not know.

830
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:42,616
well.

831
01:04:43,228 --> 01:04:44,970
So the party in office this weekend failed

832
01:04:45,035 --> 01:04:46,405
because of them.

833
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:52,234
- And what about the cove? - It's fucking cold out there.

834
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:55,416
Big deal to find some place off.

835
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,538
What kind of party?

836
01:04:56,669 --> 01:04:58,783
What kind of party? Fucking party.

837
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,906
It's nothing, just friends hanging out.

838
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:02,077
You can use my house.

839
01:05:03,338 --> 01:05:04,453
What?

840
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:06,986
- Seriously?- Yeah. Why not?

841
01:05:07,254 --> 01:05:10,450
This weekend is not so good,because my wife's back, but

842
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,584
you know we can do next week. Friday?

843
01:05:12,858 --> 01:05:14,249

844
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,265

845
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:20,409

846
01:05:20,582 --> 01:05:21,752
What else guys need?

847
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,936
Appetisers,you know paper plates,these staff?

848
01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:28,448
No, no, no. We're ok. We have coverage.

849
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:29,963
Great. We're on

850
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:32,769
Okay, thanks, man.

851
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:46,763
- You didn't have to do that.  - It'll be fun.

852
01:06:00,404 --> 01:06:01,527
Richard?

853
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:04,591
Richard?

854
01:06:06,414 --> 01:06:08,566
Richard, please?

855
01:06:11,246 --> 01:06:12,289
Hi

856
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:18,242
When the world is in peril.

857
01:06:18,698 --> 01:06:21,162
When evil is around you.

858
01:06:21,263 --> 01:06:22,410
When danger ...

859
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:23,841
OK?

860
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:32,183
- Richard, help me.  - You don't like it?

861
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:35,277
All furniture is outside and. ..

862
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,526
What the hell is this?

863
01:06:38,112 --> 01:06:40,509
You seem disappointed, you're going up with your body language.

864
01:06:40,604 --> 01:06:43,225
You don't pick up the phone once this week.

865
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:44,268
You don't

866
01:06:44,269 --> 01:06:45,572
Call me once.

867
01:06:45,853 --> 01:06:48,701
I traveled all the way out here and there's this!

868
01:06:49,921 --> 01:06:51,437
Richard, say something.

869
01:06:52,122 --> 01:06:53,572
Well, I ...

870
01:07:03,918 --> 01:07:06,461
- What is it?  - What is what?

871
01:07:06,576 --> 01:07:08,044
This? Whose is it?

872
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:10,253
Richard, just tell her.

873
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,128
- Claire? - Yes?

874
01:07:15,094 --> 01:07:19,429
Are we unhappy or are we just pretendding to be unhappy?

875
01:07:21,212 --> 01:07:22,359
What do you mean?

876
01:07:22,392 --> 01:07:24,834
Are we just pretending to be unhappy,

877
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:27,237
to add dramaes to our life?

878
01:07:27,345 --> 01:07:30,497
So that we seem somehow more substantial?

879
01:07:31,539 --> 01:07:32,841
I mean, think about it:

880
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,132
Our lives are embarrassingly easy.

881
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:36,375
We got plenty of money.

882
01:07:36,376 --> 01:07:37,523
We got friends.

883
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,771
Well, you got friends.

884
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:41,560
There are people out there who have real problems.

885
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:42,604
You know?

886
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:45,950
Real reasons to be unhappy.

887
01:07:46,615 --> 01:07:50,705
I mean I could be a coal miner dying of black loan , or something.

888
01:07:50,796 --> 01:07:54,190
You could be a Cincinnati clack on foodstuff

889
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:55,430
-What?  - I do not know.

890
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:59,427
I'm just on it. Doesn't it feel like we were faking it

891
01:08:00,189 --> 01:08:01,621
our unhappiness?

892
01:08:03,233 --> 01:08:04,292
No.

893
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:07,392
No. It's real.

894
01:08:07,772 --> 01:08:08,919
It is very real.

895
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,742
I'm going home now.

896
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:24,233
I think you think this's still charming.

897
01:08:24,387 --> 01:08:26,292
We aren't 23 any more.

898
01:08:26,376 --> 01:08:28,013
You need to pull it together.

899
01:08:29,222 --> 01:08:30,721
Pick up the phone this week.

900
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:36,353
And bring the fucking furniture into the lawn!

901
01:08:51,766 --> 01:08:54,700
Norwood believes his solitude something like ...

902
01:08:55,122 --> 01:08:59,098
Norwood? Norman? Richmond? Richmond!

903
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:03,268

904
01:09:06,461 --> 01:09:07,960
- Richmond?- Richmond.

905

Schimithmond? Schimithmond!

01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,061
Richmond regarded his solitude as something like ...

907
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:22,161
Oh!

908
01:09:23,308 --> 01:09:24,700
Unbearable!

909
01:09:25,121 --> 01:09:26,490
Richmond regarded his solitude as something like ...

910
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,436
Unbearable!

911
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:35,537
Richmond regarded his solitude as something... unbearable.

912
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:14,813
Scalpel.

913
01:10:18,773 --> 01:10:21,264
You started too high.You need to go down

914
01:10:21,328 --> 01:10:25,226
to the base of the head and cut off it, good.

915
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,516
Careful, careful, careful.

916
01:10:28,028 --> 01:10:29,537
Let me help you.

917
01:10:29,922 --> 01:10:31,000
All right.

918
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:37,591
Good, good, good.

919
01:10:42,253 --> 01:10:44,345
OK.Would you rather ...

920
01:10:46,048 --> 01:10:50,185
always walk backwards or being stabbed when take a new step?

921
01:10:50,905 --> 01:10:52,360
Why would I wanna do neither?

922
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:54,358
It's a game, just pick one.

923
01:10:57,714 --> 01:11:02,753
Oh, throw in the pan. Beautiful!

924
01:11:02,893 --> 01:11:04,425
You are really good at this.

925
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:06,404
My wife reattach the leg today.

926
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,808
-Oh no  -You should be a fish monger.

927
01:11:09,896 --> 01:11:12,413
You know, monger some fish.

928
01:11:13,246 --> 01:11:14,683
Which one do you prefer,walking back

929
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:16,087
or just step out?

930
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:18,878
Could I just were a special kind of shoes or ...

931
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,997
No.

932
01:11:21,705 --> 01:11:25,181
You look back in a minute. Gently gently gently

933
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:28,542
I guess I would uh...  walk backwards,

934
01:11:28,626 --> 01:11:30,595
I'm not good with pain. You?

935
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:33,529
I like to see where I'm going.

OK. Come here.

937
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:44,860

940
01:11:59,956 --> 01:12:01,437

01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,060
Oh!

942
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,221
A camel?

943
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,794
A peacock?

944
01:12:20,383 --> 01:12:24,556
It's the swan.The beautiful and graceful swan.

945
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:26,670
Sorry.

946

No.It looks great.

953
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:26,908
The party's house.

954
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:30,014
Barrels are here and I got the uh... put in order in the kitchen.

955
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:31,567

01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:33,605

01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:43,479

01:13:43,988 --> 01:13:45,784
Oh, relax. It'll be fun.

961

01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:07,211
Stop it!

1002
01:18:07,993 --> 01:18:09,885
- Are you okay?  - What is the deal?

1003
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:11,804
What is the deal? You fucked with him?

1004
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,010
- Stop! - You fucked with her?

1005
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:15,162
No!

1006
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:16,400
I do not give a shit.

1007
01:18:16,467 --> 01:18:18,614
You can have her.She is fucking crazy anyway.

1008
01:18:19,385 --> 01:18:21,147
Why don't you go back to loony bin

1009
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,332
where you belong.

1010
01:18:22,514 --> 01:18:23,720
And take him with you!

1011
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:26,236
Get the fuck out!

1012
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:27,825
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
01:18:27,978 --> 01:18:31,376
Get fuck out! Now! Go!

1014
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:35,955
What are you looking at? Go out here!

1015
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:37,895
Party is over.

1016
01:18:41,574 --> 01:18:42,844
Chicken shit.

1017
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:44,215
He is an asshole.

1018
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,832
Yeah

1019
01:18:51,712 --> 01:18:53,033
Great party?

1020
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,303
Yeah.

1021
01:19:01,973 --> 01:19:03,276
I love you.

1022
01:19:06,762 --> 01:19:07,878
What?

1023
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:15,256
I think .. uh ... in an appropriate way.

1024
01:19:17,926 --> 01:19:19,178
I  I thing you should know.

1025
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:25,963
I discovered I just find when I examined

1026
01:19:27,007 --> 01:19:31,602
my heart, I found ...

1027
01:19:34,882 --> 01:19:38,986
I think there's love there.

1028
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:42,701
For you.

1029
01:19:44,264 --> 01:19:45,437
Yeah.

1030
01:19:49,739 --> 01:19:51,130
I love you.

1031
01:20:04,202 --> 01:20:06,873
it wasn't... it wasn't really of love only being in use.

1032
01:20:09,978 --> 01:20:11,935
I mean, as lonely as ever, I called on months

1033
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:14,428
you know just until I ...

1034
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,493
My parents thought of ...

1035
01:20:27,283 --> 01:20:28,650
I don't know.

1036
01:20:33,016 --> 01:20:34,680
I never told them.

1037
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:39,795
Never ...

1038
01:20:41,095 --> 01:20:43,051
told anyone else.

1039
01:20:45,712 --> 01:20:47,213
That was a pact.

1040
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:00,588
me and Amy were both there to go.

1041
01:21:03,163 --> 01:21:05,953
enter the water and she didn't...

1042
01:21:10,104 --> 01:21:12,058
didn't swim back.

1043
01:21:19,035 --> 01:21:20,648
I swam back.

1044
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,278
I could ...I could...

1045
01:21:34,607 --> 01:21:37,760
I do not know what we were so unhappy about. I mean ...

1046
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,699
How could we be so unhappy about ...

1047
01:21:46,566 --> 01:21:48,152


1048
01:21:53,919 --> 01:21:55,664
I think you ...you are too young to know

1049
01:21:55,665 --> 01:21:58,719
you can get over anything.

1050
01:22:41,924 --> 01:22:44,240
He's always made poor decisions.

1051
01:22:45,369 --> 01:22:46,810
same with her.

1052
01:22:48,848 --> 01:22:50,460
I feel helpless.

1053
01:22:55,463 --> 01:22:56,783
How long have you been with her?

1054
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,209
Since she was 8.

1055
01:22:59,511 --> 01:23:00,565
You?

1056
01:23:00,712 --> 01:23:05,304
Oh, Christ, it's got to be over 40 years.

1057
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:09,850
second grade.

1058
01:23:10,893 --> 01:23:12,567
So he was a little old for you?

1059
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,738
I keep telling him that.

1060
01:23:16,203 --> 01:23:17,591
He never listens.

1061
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:20,195
He never do? - No.

1062
01:23:22,488 --> 01:23:23,802
What is your dig?

1063
01:23:25,826 --> 01:23:27,680
I must have done them all.

1064
01:23:28,707 --> 01:23:33,012
Monsters under the bed, a cheerleader,

1065
01:23:34,069 --> 01:23:35,192
governor...

1066
01:23:38,573 --> 01:23:40,886
These days have not been the right time to tell him the truth.

1067
01:23:40,942 --> 01:23:42,004
And you?

1068
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:43,796
I'm crazy in love with her.

1069
01:23:46,303 --> 01:23:47,900
- oh! tough one. - Yeah.

1070
01:23:49,617 --> 01:23:50,897
It's been hurry.

1071
01:23:52,581 --> 01:23:54,405
I think She's almost done with me.

1072
01:23:54,578 --> 01:23:58,998
Good, Great,  Run away while you can.

1073
01:24:00,766 --> 01:24:04,058
Tell her to open the door and you run.

1074
01:24:05,463 --> 01:24:07,318
You don't want to end up like me.

1075
01:24:08,785 --> 01:24:10,048
I guess not.

1076
01:24:15,065 --> 01:24:19,398
- Captain Excellent. - Christopher.

1077
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:22,371
Nice to meet you.

1078
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:25,141
See you around.

1079
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:10,699
Oh!

1080
01:25:15,098 --> 01:25:16,161
What?

1081
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,181
What? What?

1082
01:25:19,303 --> 01:25:20,734
Wait a second.

1083
01:25:20,927 --> 01:25:22,450
Son of bitch!

1084
01:25:22,907 --> 01:25:25,233
Do not react here.

1085
01:25:25,325 --> 01:25:26,613
Do not tell me how to react.

1086
01:25:26,694 --> 01:25:28,424
- It's not like that. - Shut up.

1087
01:25:29,726 --> 01:25:31,583
What? What is this? Richard

1088
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,385
Who is that? Who the fuck is that?

1089
01:25:34,499 --> 01:25:35,833
She is the babysitter.

1090
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:40,087
Get out. Get out.

1091
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:41,377
Get out!

1092
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:46,084
Hi, Lucy! Hi, Peter!

1093
01:25:47,365 --> 01:25:48,463
Hi

1094
01:25:49,475 --> 01:25:51,024
Claire we'll just be ...

1095
01:25:54,177 --> 01:25:56,612
I did not sleep with the babysitter, if that's what you think of.

1096
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,242
Oh, that is so comforting.

1097
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:00,403
Why do we even have a babysitter?

1098
01:26:00,523 --> 01:26:03,320
It was just a kegger, Claire. That was all.

1099
01:26:03,619 --> 01:26:04,854
just a kegger?

1100
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:07,537
And with whom exactly did you have a kegger?

1101
01:26:07,623 --> 01:26:09,156
just kids from high school .

1102
01:26:09,213 --> 01:26:10,858
Richard, just stop.

1103
01:26:11,057 --> 01:26:13,175
none of this is ok. -ok

1104
01:26:13,325 --> 01:26:15,098
You knew we were coming this weekend.

1105
01:26:15,358 --> 01:26:16,617
Why are you doing this?

1106
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:18,702
I've been a bit at a loss.

1107
01:26:19,627 --> 01:26:21,059
what a bullshit answer.

1108
01:26:21,157 --> 01:26:23,761
I was being flandering and Abby was being ...

1109
01:26:23,829 --> 01:26:25,438
What? Abby was being what?

1110
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:27,459
A friend.

1111
01:26:27,663 --> 01:26:30,140
For God's sake, that is not a friend, that's a child.

1112
01:26:30,216 --> 01:26:32,041
- You do have friends. - No, I do not.

1113
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:36,912
I think that is a touble here... 

1114
01:26:37,169 --> 01:26:39,452
Cause you do not have a relate to other human beings.

1115
01:26:40,272 --> 01:26:42,140
Yeah, you isolate yourself.

1116
01:26:42,257 --> 01:26:43,115
Oh, you can talk.

1117
01:26:43,116 --> 01:26:44,619
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1118
01:26:44,767 --> 01:26:46,283
You can be cold, Claire.

1119
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:48,953
I think we just get out of here.

1120
01:26:49,356 --> 01:26:50,741
We just get out of here

1121
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:52,428
leave this area.

1122
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,901
- Where? - I do not know, anywhere.

1123
01:26:57,507 --> 01:27:00,043
I don't know if it's your profession or what... you know, but it makes your heart.

1124
01:27:00,044 --> 01:27:00,843
I cannot and I don't accept that.

1125
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:02,403
I wanna to have a baby

1126
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:05,466
Is that what this is all about?

1127
01:27:05,532 --> 01:27:07,198
We could have a baby, Claire.

1128
01:27:07,411 --> 01:27:09,638
Why did not we have a baby? Why?

1129
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,290
Because you're a baby.

1130
01:27:11,429 --> 01:27:12,768
You're an enfant.

1131
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:15,371
You still have an imaginary friend.

1132
01:27:15,473 --> 01:27:18,094
I just wanted a little warm thing.

1133
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,423
Something simple  I could start with.

1134
01:27:20,478 --> 01:27:23,909
A simple relationship with a person that was new and pure.

1135
01:27:24,097 --> 01:27:25,863
well, I could be me, they could be them.

1136
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:28,324
and that's all I've expected we can build.

1137
01:27:28,404 --> 01:27:32,185
In this world there's someone other than me

1138
01:27:32,254 --> 01:27:34,619
to think about and be about.

1139
01:27:35,298 --> 01:27:39,614
and the relief of being able to give the world to someone else

1140
01:27:40,743 --> 01:27:42,744
and let it be there and let them have their turn.

1141
01:27:42,843 --> 01:27:44,980
so it doesn't end with me.

1142
01:27:46,035 --> 01:27:51,169
Well that's all you, Where do I come in?

1143
01:27:51,802 --> 01:27:54,082
What do you mean?

1144
01:27:54,248 --> 01:27:56,005
God, you're the mother.

1145
01:27:58,938 --> 01:28:01,912
Ah, I am so sorry, guys.

1146
01:28:01,913 --> 01:28:04,674
We are gonna go we're just gonna go...

1147
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:08,180
We can be just anywhere Anywhere.

1148
01:28:08,649 --> 01:28:11,529
I'm so sorry.- No no no. All right.

1149
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:12,970
We're just going out  -I will walk you out I'm sorry

1150
01:28:13,012 --> 01:28:14,805
Wish you all go on a crew or something

1151
01:28:18,569 --> 01:28:19,660
Okay.

1152
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:30,073
Okay. Take care.

1153
01:28:50,155 --> 01:28:51,492
Alright. if we are gonna do this, let's ...

1154
01:28:51,643 --> 01:28:54,880
Alright, by the way, what's she like? like 13,14?

1155
01:28:55,342 --> 01:28:57,847
At least we'll get the fact straight.

1156
01:28:57,946 --> 01:29:01,094
It was you, Richard. you didn't want to have a baby.

1157
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:04,285
you weren't ready.

1158
01:29:04,398 --> 01:29:06,707
so that little fuzzy fucking speech my friends had to hear was bull shit.

1159
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:10,395
now, I know that I'm...  I can't.

1160
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:14,501
so I guess I am the bad guy.

1161
01:29:18,673 --> 01:29:19,870
No not the novel that's... 

1162
01:29:19,871 --> 01:29:21,439
I'd rather you didn't...

1163
01:29:21,828 --> 01:29:24,211
What is this? What is this?

1164
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:26,998
That's it.

1165
01:29:28,182 --> 01:29:30,758
After all this time out here and this is it?

1166
01:29:30,815 --> 01:29:31,896
this is That?

1167
01:29:32,616 --> 01:29:35,319
Maybe you should spent more time working instead of ...

1168
01:29:35,613 --> 01:29:37,144
fucking the babysitter.

1169
01:29:37,274 --> 01:29:39,096
- No. I. .. - You're useless.  -Yes

1170
01:29:39,232 --> 01:29:42,055
- You are totally useless! - Yes. I am.

1171
01:29:42,195 --> 01:29:43,815
What is wrong with you?

1172
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:47,474
I do not know what to do with my hands.

1173
01:29:56,764 --> 01:29:58,050
Everyone.

1174
01:29:58,296 --> 01:30:02,106
Janeth, my sister and Olive all have been made

1175
01:30:02,206 --> 01:30:04,129
I have the one who made me laugh.

1176
01:30:04,554 --> 01:30:05,805
What happened?

1177
01:30:05,855 --> 01:30:07,289
I do not know what happened.

1178
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,635
You stopped laughing.

1179
01:31:13,876 --> 01:31:16,570
- May I help you? - Yeah.

1180
01:31:16,646 --> 01:31:18,395
I came here to pay my respects.

1181
01:31:18,604 --> 01:31:21,677
- sorry? - Heath Hen, the North American Heath Hen...

1182
01:31:21,885 --> 01:31:25,052
it's where the last one lived and died.

1183
01:31:25,207 --> 01:31:28,016
I don't know anything about the Heath Hen.

1184
01:31:29,354 --> 01:31:31,212
But you are welcome to look around.

1185
01:31:31,274 --> 01:31:33,361
We've got several varieties of proper.

1186
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:34,567
Thank you.

1187
01:32:00,654 --> 01:32:03,163
So that is what the end of something looks like.

1188
01:32:03,389 --> 01:32:05,065
The world went on, Richard.

1189
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:06,485
But never the same.

1190
01:32:06,582 --> 01:32:08,553
We do not know how much it changes things.

1191
01:32:08,554 --> 01:32:09,604
but it is just being here.

1192
01:32:09,662 --> 01:32:11,069
The ripple of the fact.

1193
01:32:11,538 --> 01:32:12,980
if the chicken hadn't died out here,

1194
01:32:12,982 --> 01:32:14,424
you will be perfectly adusted.

1195
01:32:14,499 --> 01:32:15,543
Maybe.

1196
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:16,717
Doubtful.

1197
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:20,822
Instead of a child, I am a loser

1198
01:32:20,907 --> 01:32:23,004
and I am condemned to believe in Captain.

1199
01:32:23,429 --> 01:32:25,014
it's like a little hand.

1200
01:32:29,946 --> 01:32:32,357
It's ...It's time for you to go.

1201
01:32:33,697 --> 01:32:34,757
No.

1202
01:32:35,645 --> 01:32:37,765
You know what I am saying, Captain.

1203
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:45,597
I mean, go and never come back.

1204
01:32:47,338 --> 01:32:48,691
I'm not ready.

1205
01:32:49,649 --> 01:32:50,954
it doesn't matter.

1206
01:32:51,736 --> 01:32:53,592
You can not help me anymore.

1207
01:32:56,086 --> 01:32:57,470
The doctor is right.

1208
01:32:57,883 --> 01:32:59,264
but You will be alone.

1209
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:00,847
Yes

1210
01:33:01,935 --> 01:33:03,485
as the last of my kind.

1211
01:33:08,612 --> 01:33:09,951
OK.

1212
01:33:14,251 --> 01:33:15,698
do the voice.

1213
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:18,758
One last time.

1214
01:33:22,603 --> 01:33:23,769
Please.

1215
01:33:30,489 --> 01:33:32,380
When the world is peril.

1216
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:37,613
When evil surrounds you.

1217
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:41,537
When danger is lurking.

1218
01:33:46,588 --> 01:33:48,134
Who do you call?

1219
01:33:50,921 --> 01:33:53,071
Captain Excellent!

1220
01:35:25,384 --> 01:35:30,598
I wish I had a really amazing and vital father like him.

1221
01:36:02,395 --> 01:36:03,569
Captain?

1222
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:15,552
Richmond regarded his solitude... The ...

1223
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:19,819
Merton regarded his solitude ... Norton regarded his solitude ...

1224
01:36:19,935 --> 01:36:22,269
Horton regarded his solitude ...Norton thought ...

1225
01:36:23,289 --> 01:36:28,027
Norwood regarded his solitude...The ...

1226
01:36:29,821 --> 01:36:33,371
Richard? Richard?

1227
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:42,481
Richard!

1228
01:36:54,318 --> 01:36:59,078
Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred.

1229
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:43,247
I had dreams last night and uh. ..

1230
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,887
you were in it.

1231
01:37:46,272 --> 01:37:47,650
ah? was it interesting?

1232
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,233
you were you.

1233
01:37:54,859 --> 01:37:56,411
You're leaving, aren't you?

1234
01:37:59,292 --> 01:38:00,366
yeah, you know, because of the

1235
01:38:02,487 --> 01:38:03,998
- situation ...

1236
01:38:05,012 --> 01:38:07,485
- Yeah.

1237
01:38:07,746 --> 01:38:08,836
I figured it.

1238
01:38:14,709 --> 01:38:16,337
You know, spring is ...

1239
01:38:17,684 --> 01:38:19,115
my favorite time.

1240
01:38:21,007 --> 01:38:23,289
cause summer has not arrived yet.

1241
01:38:24,087 --> 01:38:25,618
and it's not fucking cold.

1242
01:38:29,957 --> 01:38:31,873
uh ... I. ..

1243
01:38:33,064 --> 01:38:34,758
I made something for you.

1244
01:38:48,627 --> 01:38:50,386
It is the swan.

1245
01:38:55,121 --> 01:38:57,467
The beautiful and graceful swan.

1246
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:01,785
It's ...Richard, it's perfect.

1247
01:39:02,376 --> 01:39:03,987
yeah

1248
01:39:06,231 --> 01:39:07,495
Thank you.

1249
01:39:11,479 --> 01:39:15,459
It seems like that we were just come started.

1250
01:39:22,549 --> 01:39:23,646
Take care.

1251
01:39:45,802 --> 01:39:46,845
Okay.

1252
01:41:20,021 --> 01:41:21,064
okay

1253
01:41:53,942 --> 01:41:55,442
I am a horse's ass.

1254
01:41:59,979 --> 01:42:01,397
Yes, you are.

1255
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:06,889
I am sorry.

1256
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,006
I kind of need some help to get this couch in.

1257
01:42:45,727 --> 01:42:48,955
Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred.

1258
01:42:49,397 --> 01:42:51,787
As well as a badge of honor.

1259
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,113
A clock to be warned of warm to life

1260
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:57,882
As well as safety.

1261
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:01,470
Solitude is who he was.

1262
01:43:01,609 --> 01:43:05,888
This cast those into his lives to make him feel barely content.

1263
01:43:06,563 --> 01:43:09,015
Richard was certain that there was not lined.

1264
01:43:09,103 --> 01:43:10,687
It was just hard on man.

1265
01:43:10,895 --> 01:43:13,172
maybe it was because

1266
01:43:13,173 --> 01:43:15,100
he gave nothing and he received nothing in return.

1267
01:43:15,295 --> 01:43:18,857
In any case, the situation became untolerable.

1268
01:43:19,641 --> 01:43:24,040
the closed things he had as his friends were either imaginary or extinct.

1269
01:43:24,528 --> 01:43:26,406
Richard had reached a point in his life

1270
01:43:26,481 --> 01:43:28,340
but it was no longer enough.

1271
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:32,920
And then he met a girl.

1272
01:43:34,237 --> 01:43:35,635
And she was warm.

1273
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:37,756
And she was sad.

1274
01:43:37,905 --> 01:43:41,797
And she was maybe lonely in a way that reminded him of himself.

1275
01:43:43,006 --> 01:43:46,210
She lost things that no girl had lost.

1276
01:43:47,106 --> 01:43:48,566
And she knew things.

1277
01:43:49,521 --> 01:43:50,982
And she taught him.

1278
01:43:51,571 --> 01:43:55,610
And Richard thought maybe that was what friendship feels like.

1279
01:43:59,243 --> 01:44:00,316
Maybe.

1280
01:44:08,227 --> 01:44:10,041
It was just in the blinks.

1281
01:44:11,354 --> 01:44:13,558
it barely began really.

1282
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:21,259
But in those long few winter days.

1283
01:44:22,207 --> 01:44:23,866
She gave him so much.

1284
01:44:26,018 --> 01:44:28,560
Enough so that Richard could go on.

1285
01:44:36,117 --> 01:44:37,908
And what did he give her?

1286
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:42,691
Just a few words on a page.

1287
01:44:44,458 --> 01:44:46,202
Not much, perhaps.

1288
01:44:49,022 --> 01:44:50,477
But for Abby.

1289
01:44:51,195 --> 01:44:53,049
He hoped that was enough.

1290
01:45:39,068 --> 01:45:40,364
Okay.
