- That's the one.

738
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,044
- My wife invented and patented
a Iifesaving poIymer shunt

739
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,214
- Shunt, you say?

740
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:27,383
- Shunt

741
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,852
So there's our heath hen,

742
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,979
hunkered down at Camp Hero.

743
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:41,980
- Just down the road here?

744
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,440
- Yep.
As game warden—

745
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,441
- The Alfred guy.

746
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,442
- Yeah, correct

747
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,486
Alfred is his actual name.

748
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,824
In the book, I am going
to call him Horton or Morton.

749
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,119
Anyway, so he's brought
his flock of heath hens

750
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,037
back from the brink
of extinction.

751
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,288
- Awesome.

752
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,916
- l mean, he was down to 1 1
of them.

753
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,293
1 1, you know, but now with care,
and dare I say, Iove,

754
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,294
and incubators,

755
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,672
he's got 200.

756
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,090
And it's like the hen is saved.

757
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,425
- Safe, thank God.

758
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,760
- But because our story
is a tragedy,

759
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,220
you know what happens?
- What?

760
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,555
- Fire.

761
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,722
- No!
- Come on!

762
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,224
- Oh, yeah,
it sweeps across the preserve.

763
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,642
Of course, the heath hen,

764
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,769
not nature's most intelligent
bird to begin with...

765
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:21,979
- l hear ya.

766
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,605
- She just sits in her nest

767
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,357
You know, and she doesn't have
the sense to run

768
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,526
or fly or waddle.

769
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,987
You know,
when the fire runs out,

770
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,573
there's just five birds
remaining.

771
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,367
- Roast chicken.

772
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,205
- What happens to the five?

773
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,875
- They dwindle.

774
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,669
They dwindle

775
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,173
till there's just one left,
you know?

776
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,382
Just one.

777
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,553
Just one poor stupid
little thing.

778
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:58,765
You know,
it's just a stupid bird.

779
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,643
Just one.

780
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:10,194
lt's a true story.

781
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,989
- Another round
for my friend here, Mike.

782
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,842
- Chicken shit

783
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,532
Oh, you did make soup.

784
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,991
Bless your heart.

785
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,118
Oh.

786
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,081
Mm, oh.

787
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:05,666
Such a small act of kindness,

788
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,378
but l can't tell you
what that means to me.

789
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,379
- Well, it's no big deal.

790
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:11,838
lt's just soup.

791
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:16,510
- You are such a beautiful girl.

792
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,429
You are such a beautiful child.

793
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,639
- You're loaded.

794
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,182
- No, no, no, l—

795
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,183
well, yes.

796
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,935
- Okay, l should go.

797
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,395
Since tonight
was a little longer—

798
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,896
- You know what l am?

799
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,566
Let me tell you what l am,
just in case you're interested.

800
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,942
This is what l am.

801
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,277
- What?

802
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,196
- l am the only child
of an only child

803
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,614
and an only child.

804
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:38,949
And you know what that means.

805
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,784
- No cousins?

806
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,745
- lt means l am the end
of a bloodline,

807
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,872
the last of my kind.

808
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,958
- Okay, well,
then have some kids.

809
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,042
- [laughs]

810
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,920
Said the babysitter.

811
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:52,921
lf you only knew.

812
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,798
[groaning]

813
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:55,799
- Okay.

814
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,718
Look, it's gonna be 60 bucks.

815
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,928
Okay, you should go to bed.

816
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,306
- l don't blame her, the doctor.

817
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,892
You know, she's just—
she's a human mechanic.

818
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,813
You know, she's got her hands
inside human beings every day.

819
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,356
They're just machines to her,
you know.

820
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,734
They're machines that break,

821
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,236
like rot factories.

822
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,863
So how can you create life

823
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,448
when you know it's gonna
end up in death?

824
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:20,449
l mean, l get that

825
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:24,369
l get it!

826
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,829
l don't blame her, but—

827
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,374
- Hey, l'm sorry.

828
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,917
- Eh.

829
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:40,052
See, she doesn't realize
that human beings are warm.

830
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,720
You know, they need contact

831
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,513
They need, you know—

832
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,432
you are such a beautiful girl.

833
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,975
You are such a beautiful child.

834
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:47,976
thud!

835
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,187
No, no!

836
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,355
thud!

837
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,356
[groaning]

838
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,692
[dishes crashing]

839
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,985
- Shit

840
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,445
- [groaning]

841
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,948
- l'm gonna go.

842
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,992
[door creaking]

843
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,376
Why are men such dicks?

844
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,044
- Beats me.

845
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,046
- l just thought he was lonely.

846
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,632
- We're all lonely.

847
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,716
- l don't know.

848
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,052
Maybe l shouldn't have hit him.

849
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,846
- No, you definitely
should have.

850
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,225
Okay, would you rather?

851
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,018
- l don't want to play.

852
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,438
- Oh, come on.

853
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,986
Would you rather

854
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,656
have no TV for a year

855
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:45,492
or onIy be abIe
to watch The Golf Channel?

856
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,287
- Golf Channel.

857
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,997
- Yeah, me too.

858
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:56,378
At least it's TV.

859
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:57,504
Your turn.

860
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,845
- Okay, would you rather have
no friends or no parents?

861
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,694
[gulls cawing]

862
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,614
[door creaking]

863
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,087
- Claire?

864
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,797
- Richard, the couch is outside.

865
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,841
- ls it the 15th already?

866
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,217
- Are you okay?

867
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,218
- Yes, l am.

868
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,262
- There's soup in the kitchen.

869
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,472
Have you been making soup?

870
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,599
- l'll be right back.

871
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:00,692
- All right

872
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,693
You made the soup.

873
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:02,861
What babysitter?

874
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:06,740
Work is going great,
and l'm still not here.

875
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:07,741
Drink it up.

876
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:08,742
There you go.

877
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,827
Now get out there.

878
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,168
- You know the funny thing
about soup?

879
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,545
You get the ingredients
basicaIIy into the pot

880
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,548
along with the sauce and the—
not the sauce.

881
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:25,133
The juice.

882
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,885
- You mean the broth?

883
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:31,765
- Right, right, and then
it just needs some cooking.

884
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,141
[clears throat]

885
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,060
- Richard, is anything wrong?

886
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:36,436
l'm not—

887
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,771
l'm concerned.

888
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:42,067
- Oh, weII, thank you
for your concern, Claire.

889
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,944
Speaking of...
how are your patients?

890
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,904
Are they doing well?

891
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:50,826
And what are some
of their names?

892
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,121
- You know, you've got a bruise
right here.

893
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,207
- Oh, well, you know,
beaten down by life.

894
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,752
You know, winds of change.

895
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,712
Anyway, l want to do some
unIoading of boxes

896
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,090
if you want to pitch in.

897
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:08,468
Then we can grab some brunch.

898
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,723
- Oh, no, Richard, no.

899
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,724
Are these all—

900
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,018
- Oh, yes.

901
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,103
- Why?

902
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,771
Why would you do that
to yourseIf?

903
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,189
- Well, l just thought
as I embarked

904
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,649
on the writing of my second—

905
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,192
my much anticipated
second novel,

906
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,444
that l should be reminded
of the remarkable,

907
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,363
l mean, really
quite noteworthy failure

908
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:32,534
of my first noveI to seII
any copies whatsoever.

909
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,494
- Richard, l can't go
down this road with you.

910
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,747
- No, no, no, it's gonna be
very motivationaI, reaIIy.

911
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:54,598
- That was smooth.

912
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,640
- Hey, l got through it

913
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,142
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait

914
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,310
- What?

915
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,020
- My super senses
are telling me something.

916
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,354
- What?
- Yes.

917
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,356
I think the doctor
may be on to you.

918
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,482
- Oh, hush your mouth.

[knocking at door]

922
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,324
- Shit

923
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,034
What do you want?

924
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,662
- I came to see
if you were okay,

925
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,663
'cause your head was—

926
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,664
- lt's fine.
I'm fine.

- Well, screw you too.

931
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,883
And you were the one
who came on to me,

932
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,885
by the way.

933
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,803

for hitting you,

936
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,810
but forget it

937
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,521
You're a creep.

00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,106
- Wait, Abby.

939
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:51,154

out of her shower, FYl.

940
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,074
- Richard, who was that?

941
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:57,744
- Girl scout

942
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,537
- Oh, okay.

943
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,967
- Horton regarded his solitude
as something sacred.

944
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,220
Horton, Norton,

945
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:18,014
Norwood.

946
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,058

[groans]

948
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:33,446

- Norwood regarded his solitude
as some—

950
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,840

951
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:52,841
- lt's a fluke.

952
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:54,926
- ln what way?

953
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,302
- The fish.
lt's called a fluke.

954
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,221
The water around here
is swimming with them.

955
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,848
- Oh, okay.

956
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:01,433
What were you planning
on doing with it?

957
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,643
- Do l have to have a plan?

958
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,104
Can't l just have a fish
in the house?

959
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,522
- Yes, fine.
l'm sorry.

960
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,941
- l thought we could cook it
then eat it

961
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,192
How's that?

962
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,902
- l guess l just hadn't caught
up with the fact

963
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,031
that you're a cook now.

964
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,402

- l don't think l got a chance
to pay you the other night

975
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:51,626
How's $60?

976
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:52,627
- Keep it

977
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,337
You don't even
have a kid, so—

[horn honking]

979
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,217
- l think there was kind of
a misunderstanding

980
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,845
about some of my actions
or intentions.

981
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,221
I'm pretty sure
l said some things.

982
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,722
- Whatever.

983
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,724
I'm sure you're sorry
that you said all that stuff.

984
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,935
- l'm not sorry, actually,
about all that

985
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:12,188
What l'm sorry about is that
l was so abrupt at the house.

986
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,189
lt was just—

987
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,190
- Your wife was there.

988
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:15,400
Yeah, l figured that out

989
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,776
- Yes, it would have been,
you know,

990
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:17,777
awkward, you know?

991
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,697
- No, actually, l don't know.

992
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:24,325

We're out of here.

1000
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:50,185
And is that Chickenshit?

1001

We're going to Turner's house,
smoke a jay.

l don't want to keep you
from your jay.

1013
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:12,999
- Who's your friend
with the bike?

1014
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,626
- Abby's been babysitting
for me.

1015

00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,830
- They won't do
what l want them to do.

1041
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,627

l want them to build something
or make something.

- Like what?

1044
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,052
- Even Jesus, l mean,
he was a carpenter.

1045
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,346
You know, it wasn't enough
for him to save mankind.

1046
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,472
He needed a trade.

1047
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,560
I'm a fIimsy man,
an insubstantial.

1048
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:58,646
- Well, compared to Jesus.

"when life and land have
slipped under the horizon.

l quietly wish to never see
either again."

1059
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,091

Abby.

Abby!

- You cannot do this.

1073
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:27,985
You can't do that

1074
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,881
- lt was me

1075
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:54,887
that dared her
to go in.

1076
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:59,308
lt was really cold.

1077
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,561
It was much,
much colder than today.

1078
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,690
But you know, she wasn't gonna
turn down a dare.

1079
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:08,192
[chuckles]

1080
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,488
We were like that

1081
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,365
And l had eaten 23 oysters.

1082
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,366
- Hmm.

1083
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,077
- So l don't know

1084
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,664
why she went in
in her cIothes.

1085
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,292
Um...

1086
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,839
l guess maybe we thought
it wouId be warmer.

1087

Kids.

1088
00:58:36,472 --> 00:58:42,685
And she was laughing,

1089
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:47,732
and, you know, fine.

1090
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:52,737
And then she was...

1091
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,198
And then she was gone.

1092
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:04,624
Just under and gone.

1093
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:09,712
And l just stood there.

1094
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,887
And then a couple hours later
my mom came

1095
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,180
and found me.

1096
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:22,725
And l guess, you know,

1097
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,102
l was waiting for her
to swim back in.

1098
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:30,942
But she never did.

1099
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,069
- How old?

1100
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,446
- Same age as me.

1101
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,532
We're twins.

1102
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,701
- Oh.

1103
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,246
Oh, my God.

1104
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,665
- That was a long time ago.

1105
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,793
l like to go out there
every year

1106
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:52,088
and swim back to shore.

1107
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:55,967
You know, l like to feel
the coId.

1108
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:00,888
- lt must have—

1109
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:05,393
l don't know what to say.

1110
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,896
- So we're both only children.

1111
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:28,874
- That was our thing every year,

1112
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,794
and you know it

1113
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:38,968
And you take that guy out there
on this day.

1114
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,387
He didn't even know her.

1115
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,847
- l know.

1116
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:47,059
- Remember when l was the only
one that wouId taIk to you

1117
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,811
for a long time?

1118
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,480
- l know, but—

1119
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,566
- He doesn't love you.

1120
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:56,444
lf that's what you think,
you're wrong.

1121
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:58,529
- What do you want me to say?

1122
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,699
- l could so move
to California.

1123
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:02,950
You shouldn't just assume

1124
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,369
l'll always be around,
'cause one day

1125
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,622
maybe l won't

1126
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,333
- Stop it

1127
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,461
- ls that what you want?

1128
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,928
- l don't have much of a story,
do I?

1129
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,639
- lt's all relative, l suppose.

1130
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,724
- Exactly.

1131
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,060
Other people seem
to have had events.

1132
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,394
Things have happened to them,

1133
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,563
life-altering occurrences.

1134
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,815
- l used to do things.

1135
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:35,941
Remember?

1136
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,234
- This isn't about you.

1137
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,987
- Amazing things.

1138
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,572
[inhales deeply]

1139
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,990
What do you want me to say?

1140
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,200
- l don't know.

1141
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:45,743
- No, no, no, no.

1142
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,953
Tell me what you want me to say,
IiteraIIy,

1143
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:54,460
'cause, frankly, at this point,
l got nothing.

1144
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,588
- [whispering]

1145
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,634
- But you have touched
several lives, Richard,

1146
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:02,635
through your work.

1147
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:03,803
lt's not about your happiness

1148
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,097
but the happiness you've brought
to others.

1149
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:09,225
[phone ringing]

1150
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,065
[answering machine beeps]

1151
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,610
- Hey, look,
it's the fund-raiser

1152
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,612
for the children's hospital
tomorrow night.

1153
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,907
And l was thinking of donating
that bottle of wine,

1154
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,410
the '71 Château Petrus.

1155
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,745
l know we were saving it
for a special occasion,

1156
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,872
but, well,
it's for a good cause.

1157
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,250
So what do you think?

1158
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,043
[phone ringing]

1159
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,128
[machine beeps]

1160
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,213
Richard, did you drink
that wine,

1161
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,216
that $5,000 bottle of wine?

1162
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,676
lt's not in the rack.

1163
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,302
lt was for the children.

1164
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,889
Will you call me, please?

1165
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:52,017
[tape crackling]

1166
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,937
[knocking at door]

1167
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,440
- Come in.

1168
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,195
- Whoa.

1169
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,072
Check out the couch.

1170
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,615
- You like?

1171
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,616
- [laughs]

1172
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,659
- l made it with these.

1173
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,161
- All right!

1174
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,162
That's awesome.

1175
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,790
- Yeah, sit
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

1176
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,625
- Uh!

1177
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,626
- Huh?

1178
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,422
- lt's nice.

1179
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:25,342
- Oh, those—
just ideas for titIes.

1180
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,635
- For your new book?

1181
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,012
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool, what have you got?

1182
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,766
- Uh...

1183
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:35,186
Cloudscape,

1184
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,063
Death and Desolation,

1185
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,064
The Daffodil.

1186
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,192
- [laughs]

1187
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,446
- Memoirs of an Amnesiac,

1188
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,489
Bolero.

1189
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,907
- Bolero?

1190
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,533
- Okay.

1191
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:50,868
Ad Nauseam,

1192
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:52,203
Balm of Silence.

1193
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,746
No?

1194
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,581
Old Miss Ptarmigan's
Blackberry Wine?

1195
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,582
- Whoa.

1196
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,917
- Let's forget it

1197
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,044
Titles are impossible.

1198
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,213
[paper crinkling]

1199
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,257
- Paper Man.

1200
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,352
[laughs softly]

1201
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,408
- You seem a lot more
interesting than me.

1202
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,203
- l'm not

1203
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,539
It just seems that way
because l have a dead sister.

1204
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,666
[door creaking]

1205
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,000
- Where you been all day?

1206
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,168
- l don't know.

1207
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,170
- Whatever.

1208
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,755
So the party's off this weekend.

1209
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,257
Turner's mom busted him.

1210
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,719
- So what about the cove?

1211
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,180
- lt's fucking cold out there.

1212
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:54,181
- Big deal.

1213
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,182
So the party's off.

1214
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,517
- What kind of party?

1215
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,935
- What do mean
"What kind of party?"

1216
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,603
A fucking party.
- Just nothing.

1217
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:00,813
Just some friends hanging out

1218
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,273
- You could use my place.

1219
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,900
- What?

1220
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:05,901
- Seriously?

1221
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:06,902
- Yeah, why not?

1222
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,696
This weekend's not so good.

1223
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:09,864
My wife's back.

1224
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,615
But you know,
we could do next week.

1225
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:12,825
Friday?

1226
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,869
- Friday is cool.

1227
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:15,870
- Really?

1228
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,497
- Yeah, l'll get a keg.

1229
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,332
- Nice!
Nice.

1230
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,584
- What else do you guys need?

1231
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,044
Appetizers, you know,
paper plates and stuff?

1232
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:25,963
- No, no, no.

1233
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,298
We're okay.

1234
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,299
We've got it covered.

1235
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,551
- Great, we're on.

1236
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:31,719
- Righteous.

1237
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:32,845
Thanks, man.

1238
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,940
- You didn't have to do that

1239
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,026
- Ah, it'll be fun.

1240
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,360
[slurping]

1241
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,999
- Richard!

1242
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,877
Richard?

1243
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,964
Richard, please.

1244
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:15,721
- Hi.

1245
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:16,722
- [booming voice]

1246
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,682
When the world is in peril,

1247
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,894
when evil surrounds you,
when dange—

1248
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:22,895
[door slams]

1249
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,021
Okay.

1250
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,694
- Richard, help me.

1251
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,112
- You don't like it?

1252
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,782
- All the furniture is outside.

1253
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:38,035
And what the hell is this?

1254
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,788
- You seem disappointed,
going off your body language.

1255
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:43,207
- You don't pick up the phone
once this week.

1256
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,709
You don't call me once.

1257
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:49,880
l drive all the way out here,
and there's this.

1258
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,257
Richard, say something.

1259
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,759
- [stammering]

1260
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:03,852
- [sighs]

1261
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,312
What's this?

1262
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,814
- What's what?

1263
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:08,440
- This.
Whose is this?

1264
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,526
- Will you just tell her?

1265
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:12,361
- Claire?

1266
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,239
- Yes?

1267
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:16,991
- Are we unhappy,

1268
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:20,911
or are we just pretending
to be unhappy?

1269
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,371
- What do you mean?

1270
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,999
- Are we just pretending
to be unhappy

1271
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,126
to add drama to our lives

1272
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:31,505
so that we seem somehow
more substantial?

1273
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,798
l mean, think about it

1274
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,883
Our lives
are embarrassingly easy.

1275
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,260
We've got plenty of money.

1276
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:37,386
We got friends.

1277
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,512
Well, you've got friends.

1278
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,180
There are people out there

1279
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,474
who have real problems,
you know,

1280
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:45,978

Richard regarded his solitude
as something sacred,

1826
01:42:49,455 --> 01:42:52,833
as a well-earned
badge of honor,

1827
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,211
a cloak to be worn
to ward off life,

1828
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:59,047
as his safety.

1829
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:01,591
Solitude is who he was.

1830
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,426
This caused those in his life

1831
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:06,471
to view him
with a barely veiled contempt.

1832
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,141
Richard was certain
that he was not liked,

1833
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:10,851
which is hard on a man.

1834
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:13,019
Maybe it was because
he gave nothing

1835
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:15,355
that he received nothing
in return.

1836
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:19,860
ln any case, his situation
had become intolerable.

1837
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:21,778
The closest things
he had to friends

1838
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,406
were either imaginary
or extinct.

1839
01:43:24,574 --> 01:43:26,408
Richard had reached a point
in his life

1840
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:31,204
where this was no longer
enough.

1841
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:34,291
And then he met a girl,

1842
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:38,086
and she was warm,
and she was sad,

1843
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:39,921
and she was maybe lonely
in a way

1844
01:43:40,089 --> 01:43:42,966
that reminded him of himself.

1845
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:47,637
She'd lost things that a girl
should never have lost.

1846
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:51,516
And she knew things,
and she taught him.

1847
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:52,976
And Richard thought,

1848
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:59,482
"Maybe this is what friendship
feels like.

1849
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:03,028
Maybe."

1850
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:11,411

1852
01:44:18,628 --> 01:44:22,255
But in those long
few winter days,

1853
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:26,092
she'd given him so much,

1854
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:29,387
enough so that Richard
could go on.

1855
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:40,190
And what had he given her?

1856
01:44:40,358 --> 01:44:44,444
Just a few words on a page.

1857
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:49,032
Not much, perhaps.

1858
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:54,037
But for Abby,
he hoped it was enough.
