2
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,968
The photos did not do justice.

3
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,349
- I said it was dangerous.
- I'm fine. Okay.

4
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,550
Are you sick of car?

5
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,173
Of course I'm
sick car.

6
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:48,174
You know I ...

7
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:49,424
Richard, I think you
not understand

8
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:51,799
where he is coming here.
I had it.

9
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,569
I knew it.

10
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,507
I can handle it.
Please give me some credit.

11
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:57,800
I can not stay quiet.

12
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:00,985
I can not believe
as it is great here.

13
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,610
Are you coming?

14
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:07,831
Oh, good God!

15
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,127
Claire?

16
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:11,015
Oh, you poor thing.

17
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,252
At least it was quick.

18
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,484
A clean cut throat.

19
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,548
I think it would
appropriate to bury him.

20
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:35,205
I feel like
lost my parents.

21
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:40,731
Oh, thank you.

22
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:59,203
Oh, this is a charm.

23
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,442
The cooker works.
Good

24
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:07,430
I do not know if the oven works.

25
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,916
Perhaps we can
do some dishes.

26
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh, listen!
Come here, come here.

27
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,085
There he is.
The sound of the sea.

28
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,396
It's still in there.

29
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,351
Wow!
Is.

30
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,176
Really wonderful.

31
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,573
Oh, is full of towels.

32
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:32,152
We need not bring any.

33
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,357
Oh well ...

34
00:04:34,283 --> 00:04:37,127
The fuse box is
inside the cabinet, Richard.

35
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,875
Oh, starry lights.
Richard?

36
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:55,667
The couch.
It can be a problem.

37
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,014
Do not fixate on it.

38
00:04:58,527 --> 00:04:59,627
You're right.

39
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:02,619
- Wonderful! Everything.
- Well, okay.

40
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,763
You could bring
baggage car?

41
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:07,219
I do this.

42
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:14,903
Phil Turley is very concerned
with the community effort

43
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:18,042
for the protection of local
reproduction of nature reserve.

44
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,761
So it should be.

45
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:22,696
Listen, I put all
my numbers

46
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,219
over that shit
messages on the telephone table,

47
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,687
so you can call a taxi
if you have to go somewhere.

48
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,417
I have the surgery
nine until noon,

49
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:32,509
then I give a checked
on you after that. Right?

50
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:33,838
Great.
Good

51
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,165
Are you sure you do not want
rent a car?

52
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,164
They did not say that
have a bike?

53
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:42,465
I think it's in the garage.

54
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:44,262
It's ten minutes to the city.
No big deal.

55
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:46,542
Okay.
It is with you.

56
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,827
So what are your
plans for tomorrow?

57
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,150
I'll start at the beginning.

58
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,811
It is a very good place
to start.

59
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,249
Speaking of witch ...

60
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:02,228
Close your eyes.

61
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,217
Right.
Can open.

62
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:16,500
- Oh!
- Marc bought one of these.

63
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:18,141
He said it is easy to use.

64
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:19,654
Richard, be careful with words.

65
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,559
Actually, I was thinking
in writing in Corona.

66
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:25,749
- Oh!
- No, but that's good.

67
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:28,717
This is ... you're right.
That's better.

68
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:32,350
Okay.

69
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,346
Richard?
Easy to handle.

70
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:58,912
Oh, I talked with Peter and Lucy

71
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,641
and invited them to come
this weekend.

72
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,303
Great, great!

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,593
- Who?
- Peter and Lucy?

74
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:08,424
Oh, yeah.
They are always fun.

75
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,141
Is.
Is.

76
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:16,987
You did not bring
onwards, brought?

77
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,736
What? No.
No, absolutely not.

78
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:23,985
Okay.

79
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,576
See you later.

80
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,201
Have one weeks productive, right?

81
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:37,264
Save some lives!

82
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,710
R-No Pressure
Love, C

83
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:49,685
- Any news?
- Get off me, man.

84
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:52,043
Remember the time you and I
we took a neighbor's bicycle

85
00:08:52,185 --> 00:08:53,482
for a little fun?

86
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,515
No, I do not remember.
Let me go.

87
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:58,201
I think because
circumstances

88
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:01,529
for wisdom and I feel
compelled to end it.

89
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,387
Want to get away?
I have things to do.

90
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:06,067
- I feel the danger.
- Stop saying that.

91
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,732
Be careful!

92
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,085
Already a cheerleader, anyway?

93
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,572
I'm not.

94
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:05,332
- It's so easy to be a cheerleader.
- It's so easy to fall dead.

95
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,150
Oh!

96
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,873
No! No!
Not at all.

97
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,593
Soap for hands?
Oh!

98
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,435
No.
It's for your wheels.

99
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:48,185
The squeak is
driving me crazy.

100
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,303
It's a beautiful bike, however.

101
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,157
A little small for his age.

102
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,879
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.

103
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,020
- Not?
- I'm not, I'm not.

104
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,873
You're not coming?

105
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,872
Well, I ... I just
I moved to the city

106
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:18,406
and I need ...
uh ... a nanny.

107
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:24,341
I thought maybe you ...
you ... I knew someone.

108
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:25,668
Is.
Okay.

109
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:26,997
When you need me?

110
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:28,777
Oh!

111
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:31,332
Friday ...

112
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:32,779
night ...

113
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:34,251
six ...

114
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:36,965
Address and phone number?

115
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,519
Item 18 of Sag Harbor Road.

116
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,530
I do not know the phone number yet.

117
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,640
Sorry.

118
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,582
Okay.
I see him Friday.

119
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,051
I'm Mr. ..
My name is Richard.

120
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,971
Merton finds his solitude
as sacred.

121
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,019
Merton finds his solitude
As ...

122
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:53,189
Admit it.
You can not without me.

123
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,240
Cares?

124
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,841
I am in communion
with nature here.

125
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:57,832
Why are you so
unable to believe

126
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,632
I can be perfectly
well alone.

127
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,974
- Because you never left.
- How?

128
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,030
Oh!
Richard, Richard, Richard.

129
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,533
How many times, huh?
How many times?

130
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:09,624
- Do not go to ballet class alone!
- Do not be kidding.

131
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:12,847
You never entered the
college alone, man.

132
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,125
Okay, enjoy.

133
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:15,522
I do not need you, Captain.

134
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:17,909
I'll resurrect my
half dead marriage alone.

135
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:20,501
Please, if you do not need me,
go alone!

136
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,470
- Okay, good morning, sir!
- Good morning!

137
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:24,584
You do not like because
I'm just fine.

138
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,344
Oh, my God!

139
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,627
Merton finds his solitude
as sacred.

140
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,062
Merton? Burton? Milton?
Milton!

141
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:45,594
Milton finds his solitude
as sacred.

142
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,112
Hey, sorry.

143
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:56,214
- I arrived a bit early.
- No.

144
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,591
No problem.
Sorry, I ...

145
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,906
- I forgot his name.
- Oh, okay.

146
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,371
I forgot yours.

147
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:06,499
I was wondering if it was
Row, Steve or Dave ... maybe?

148
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:10,211
- Richard.
- Oh, sure, that works.

149
00:15:19,364 --> 00:15:20,523
Oh, here!

150
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,696
It ... uh ... one love
for the child.

151
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:32,240
Oh well ... actually ...

152
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,017
His wife is not here with you?

153
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,520
Where is it?

154
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:37,087
Uh ... just ... just ...

155
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,324
- In the city.
- Oh!

156
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:41,114
Is.
It's only temporary.

157
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:43,947
My wife Claire is
New York Presbyterian.

158
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,330
- She's vascular surgeon.
- Oh, wow!

159
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,175
Is that her?
It's beautiful.

160
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,238
Oh, yeah, that's the Doctor.

161
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,836
My parents also
divorced, you know?

162nd
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,270
What?
Oh, no, no no.

163
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:57,612
That is not what is
happening here.

164
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,394
Just ... not ... just ...

165
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,487
Was?

166
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:04,916
Well, you probably
would find out.

167
00:16:05,988 --> 00:16:07,361
He is sleeping?

168
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,017
Uh, baby?

169
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:11,980
Ah ... one thing
about the baby.

170
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,377
Are you thirsty?

171
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,595
Oh, no.

172
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:20,583
Look ... baby ...
the baby is not ... here.

173
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:21,913
What do you mean?

174
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,631
Basically, I think ... uh ...
has no baby.

175
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,674
For now.

176
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:31,298
There are no children?

177
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:32,516
No.

178
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:37,142
Well ..

179
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:39,290
then it will be easier.

180
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,598
So ...

181
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,223
When you think you will
back home?

182
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:46,445
Oh, nine ... half past nine?

183
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,580
Okay, I have a
Hill should go home.

184
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,800
So ... have fun.

185
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:05,459
Right.

186
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,900
Chicken Shit!

187
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:52,589
Gerhard dunn
Renderer

188
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:55,381
richard dunn

189
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:07,464
Render yourself is
an easier way

190
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:09,565
a psychological mechanism
to maintain balance.

191
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,694
Never too up,
never too low.

192
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:15,505
One way to keep
line effortlessly.

193
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,113
Jesus.

194
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,536
- Do tell.
- Say what?

195
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:39,816
- I know what you're thinking.
- No. You do not know.

196
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,566
I was thinking
in pantaloons.

197
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,269
- What are you doing?
- You idiot!

198
00:18:58,711 --> 00:18:59,877
How did you get here?

199
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,039
The door was open.

200
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,000
What is extremely
dangerous, for that matter.

201
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,941
You do not need
I keep checking back.

202
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:06,645
This is not the guy who
was following you?

203
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,690
Who does that?

204
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:09,878
You do.
He just wanted a nanny.

205
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,876
Where is the child?

206
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,158
He has one child.

207
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:18,566
Abby, this guy is a pervert.
You better get out of here now.

208
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,691
He is a famous writer, right?
Go live your life.

209
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,817
You're in the middle.

210
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:38,399
You'll have trouble with it.

211
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,188
No. I'll have
problem with you.

212
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,625
- And Bryce?
- What is it?

213
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,086
- He treats her like a rag.
- When?

214
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,430
- Always.
- No.

215
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,959
- Yes.
- Shut up.

216
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:58,185
- Oh, you're crazy.
- Mad about what?

217
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:00,795
- What are you doing?
- Making a soup.

218
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:03,126
You know this guy
has five minutes

219
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:04,520
and will make soup for him?

220
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:06,578
I told you, Christopher,
he is a writer.

221
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,733
I love you.

222
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:18,043
- What are you doing here now?
- I told her nine, nine and a half.

223
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:21,638
No. I want to know what is
doing now with the girl?

224
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:22,705
Nothing.

225
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,672
Do not you think it strange,
somehow?

226
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,170
A nanny?

227
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:29,232
I am under great pressure, right?
I have to produce.

228
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,311
People expect
a brief return.

229
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:33,966
I have my editor.
I have three months

230
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,608
for three months
finish this thing.

231
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:36,939
And the girl is going to help?

232
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,668
I was popular in
school?

233
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:41,919
- In the old days?
- And the girl is going to help?

234
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,043
You have to question
every decision I take?

235
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,871
- Make better decisions.
- Just take care of the boys.

236
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:51,170
Oh! Oh, no!
He needs me.

237
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:54,128
- At the crossroads, yeah.
- At the crossroads?

238
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,129
Is.

239
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:56,625
- What?
- Is that what you do.

240
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,571
When the world is in danger.

241
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,780
When evil is around you.

242
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,783
When danger
is lurking.

243
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:21,728
Who do you call?

244
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:27,105
Captain Excellent!

245
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,636
I am a poster!

246
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,541
Is there anything out there in the woods.

247
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:54,416
Oh, my God!

248
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,101
The wolf?

249
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,478
Did not you hear?
He escaped from the zoo this morning.

250
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:00,696
It has a zoo here?

251
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:04,215
There is only one ... a ...

252
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,993
Whatever it is, I suppose
he will not get you.

253
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:10,853
Like soup?

254
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:12,635
What?

255
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,229
Is.
I made soup.

256
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,760
I thought you
could get cold.

257
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:25,352
What did you do tonight?

258
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,244
I've been thinking a bit on the beach.

259
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:32,541
For three hours?
In freezing weather?

260
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:33,883
You did this?

261
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:34,884
Is.

262
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:37,870
- How?
- I do not know.

263
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:43,164
Some carrots, onions,
one of their beers ...

264
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:46,804
Oh, I hope you're good.
I myself have not tasted.

265
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:51,648
- No, it's fantastic.
- You have not proved yet.

266
00:22:52,014 --> 00:22:53,522
No, no.
I mean, I mean ...

267
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:56,710
The fact itself ... is fantastic.
You have done something ...

268
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:58,137
from nothing.

269
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:00,047
Oh, you can ... you know ...

270
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,802
make soup with anything.

271
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:05,052
It's the great thing about it.

272
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:07,677
Anything that's left ...

273
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,680
take any crap
you have in the refrigerator,

274
00:23:11,835 --> 00:23:15,117
you can poke
and make a soup.

275
00:23:16,114 --> 00:23:17,708
Always becomes a soup.

276
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:23,217
Oh, it's superb!

277
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,180
Thank you.

278
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:27,586
No.
Seriously!

279
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,114
You ... excellent.

280
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:32,238
Do you remember the moment
he realized

281
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:34,711
the soup did not come from a can?

282
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:36,396
That we could make?

283
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:40,553
He need not take
Campbell soup all week?

284
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,022
I think I'm living
this moment right now.

285
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:49,286
Moreover, it is very nutritious.
Very good.

286
00:24:01,994 --> 00:24:05,678
- What happened there?
- Oh, sorry ... uh ...

287
00:24:06,182 --> 00:24:08,268
is something to boyfriend.

288
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:14,461
This bird reminds me of him.

289
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:16,847
He's chicken.

290
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:20,322
Actually it's not a chicken.

291
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,875
It's a bird in North America.

292
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:25,133
Relative of the chicken, but not
Technically a chicken.

293
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:27,766
You are now extinct.

294
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:31,642
The last lived here
preserved on a reservation.

295
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:34,910
I do not know that.

296
00:24:34,997 --> 00:24:36,731
I am not a scholar
bird or anything,

297
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:40,321
but this last survivor
is a character ...

298
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Of what?

299
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:46,039
This bird is the character
of this book ...

300
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:47,957
I'm trying to produce.

301
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:50,442
Uh ... right ...

302
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:52,738
Finish.

303
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:55,209
Actually begin.

304
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:02,020
Saying it aloud,
sounds kinda stupid.

305
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,162
Well, there is Chickie.

306
00:25:06,696 --> 00:25:09,333
You know, red hen?

307
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,627
- Henny Penny?
- Yeah, exactly.

308
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:12,801
Exactly.

309
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,394
There are many books
about it, but ...

310
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:19,394
poetry.

311
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:27,766
- We need to hit?
- Okay.

312
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:35,675
- Is that right?
- Actually ... uh ...

313
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:38,781
- I stop twenty per hour.
- Oh, okay.

314
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:43,830
I just got a ten.
Do you have change?

315
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,299
Let me check.

316
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,531
Her boyfriend is chicken?

317
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:52,766
Not my business, so ...

318
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,597
No.
He just ...

319
00:25:58,114 --> 00:26:02,225
He is an insect, you know, when
alone is with me is one,

320
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:08,307
when you're with friends,
turn chicken.

321
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:14,305
- Right.
- Uh, okay, so ...

322
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,289
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

323
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:27,320
I ask you a
quick question?

324
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,398
Sure.

325
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,542
This sofa does not make me
look fat?

326
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:34,904
I would not say that.

327
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:38,679
So, okay, uh ...

328
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,280
Good luck with the book of the chicken.

329
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:48,303
Same time next week?

330
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:55,256
Okay.

331
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:58,404
You told me your name.

332
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Richard?

333
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:13,900
Richard?

334
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:21,791
We're separated?

335
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
What?

336
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:25,777
It is an experience of separation
what are we doing?

337
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:27,917
What makes you think that?

338
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,289
I do not know.
We are separating?

339
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,605
Sweetness, if we are
in separating

340
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,142
you'll be the first to know.

341
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:37,265
I guess.

342
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:39,948
We'd have to discuss.

343
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:41,260
Believe me.

344
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:45,002
Okay.

345
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:47,347
Good

346
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:53,596
Just move?

347
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:59,221
Oh, is not possible.
It was cooked.

348
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,581
To death.

349
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:02,032
Poor Luizinho.

350
00:28:02,504 --> 00:28:04,283
Do not put your name, Richard.

351
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:06,849
This is ... do what you want.

352
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,990
No, do not put name
in your food.

353
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,947
Here.

354
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Oh!

355
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,775
Here.
Right?

356
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:28,920
Uhm?
Go.

357
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:31,443
Uhm?

358
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,521
If we continue covering everything
the world in butter,

359
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,773
what that world will be?

360
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:40,262
I guess.

361
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:48,773
A world buttery.

362
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:02,803
Something good?

363
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:06,131
I do not know.
It's a bit worrying.

364
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,136
So, what rendered
causes the renderer?

365
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:12,614
I did not get that part yet.

366
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,010
Well, let me know.

367
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:16,679
I'm sure it's something shiny.

368
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:20,051
What we do in
gym class?

369
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Nothing.

370
00:29:21,323 --> 00:29:24,759
- Do not think about graduating?
- I just want more support.

371
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,429
- I hate volleyball.
- Nope nothing.

372
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,853
- I'm sick of everything.
- No, you're not.

373
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:33,737
You're the best
in all directions.

374
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:35,792
Shut up.

375
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,894
- I'm not leaving anymore.
- You have to go, right?

376
00:29:43,144 --> 00:29:44,461
I'm meeting with the
Bryce later.

377
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,174
He just wants to be outdone,
you know.

378
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,659
Why put all that shit?

379
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:09,358
Why is freezing.
I do not know why.

380
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:11,337
You turned on the heater?

381
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:20,364
Already enjoyed?

382
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:23,539
Is.

383
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:53,990
See you later.

384
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:15,337
Right.

385
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,010
- Where do you go?
- I'm going.

386
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:26,196
Well, he's dead now.
You go. It's your turn.

387
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,123
I do not know how to do this all day.
I mean, a lot of pressure.

388
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:30,875
- It's just a game.
- I know.

389
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:32,009
Nobody dies here.

390
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:34,275
- Go ahead, please.
- Can we play something else.

391
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:36,384
- It's okay, you know.
- Okay.

392
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:38,561
Let's see.

393
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,803
- Well, it was fun.
- Yes, it was.

394
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,147
Weekend of practice.

395
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:03,122
Have one weeks production
and I see 15 days.

396
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,140
Is.

397
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,794
What?

398
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:27,435
Why are you raising?

399
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,031
Oh!

400
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:32,811
- Really?
- Seriously.

401
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,711
Ohh!

402
00:32:39,444 --> 00:32:40,850
Well, that's it.

403
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,996
You tried to shove a coin
the nose and take by mouth?

404
00:32:49,163 --> 00:32:52,663
And undressing cowboy
within the school. Remember?

405
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,379
Of course it was not against
those decisions.

406
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,120
I said okay, because
you was just a child.

407
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:02,363
Now it's time to grow.

408
00:33:03,004 --> 00:33:05,944
Nanny?
Bad decision, Richard.

409
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:08,318
Decision very, very bad, Richard.

410
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,502
The chairs can
be a problem.

411
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:13,067
Six.
It's too much.

412
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:17,226
Doing the monkey.

413
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:21,177
The monkey is funny
popular at the zoo.

414
00:33:21,661 --> 00:33:22,802
For example:

415
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:24,989
It's lovely to
a monkey

416
00:33:25,056 --> 00:33:26,443
with a small
piece of paper

417
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:28,582
and put it on your lap
Mommy's monkey.

418
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,222
Fold the top right corner.

419
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:48,116
Why is origami?
Why now?

420
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:50,212
I need something to
do with my hands.

421
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:54,587
Can you tell me what is the monkey
and what is the swan?

422
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:06,337
- Not to be everything?
- Oh, no.

423
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:07,899
Has much more in the truck.

424
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:09,886
Oh, great. Start
bring inside.

425
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,263
Horton ...

426
00:34:30,428 --> 00:34:33,019
Richard, for the love of God,
Do not do this, please.

427
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:34,661
Listen, you will commit
a huge mistake.

428
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,239
You go ahead?

429
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:44,343
Abby is ... my name.

430
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,069
- Oh, you got rid of the couch.
- Yeah, the couch was a problem.

431
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,309
This is for you.

432
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:10,367
Oh!
This is ...

433
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:12,369
Let's see ...

434
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,836
It is a fish.

435
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:16,085
A dead fish.

436
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:19,119
- A dead fish all over.
- Yeah.

437
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:22,337
My father was a fisherman.
He did this for a living.

438
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:25,056
- It is a sole
- In what sense?

439
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:27,603
It is called the sole.

440
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,197
The water here is
full of them.

441
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,305
So is edible?

442
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:33,976
Is.

443
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:38,823
A sole is great.
Thank you.

444
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,607
I read the book
you wrote.

445
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,670
I hope
everything is fine?

446
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,417
Reading my book, of course.

447
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:54,261
You may be
one of the few, but ...

448
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:57,129
Going out tonight?
Will the city?

449
00:35:57,526 --> 00:35:58,689
I do not know.

450
00:35:58,754 --> 00:36:00,576
I do not know what the people of
Montauk is Friday night?

451
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,718
The garden is completely dead.

452
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:05,734
So, you probably
like this:

453
00:36:05,837 --> 00:36:09,508
A bar down the port,
you can not miss.

454
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:12,644
What did you think of the book?

455
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,438
I do not know.
What did you think of it?

456
00:36:15,516 --> 00:36:18,973
I?
Oh, you know ... is ...

457
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,281
has its strength ...

458
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:23,083
has its moments ...

459
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,936
I hated it.

460
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,610
You should probably
by this fish in the refrigerator.

461
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:34,954
Why will not want
the whole house stinks.

462
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,030
Believe me, I know.

463
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,690
What?

464
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,052
Ingredients for soup.

465
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:55,581
You know, what you prefer.

466
00:36:58,227 --> 00:36:59,892
You bought me a turnip?

467
00:37:02,817 --> 00:37:04,553
You'll ruin me.

468
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,429
Well, I can sell
if you do not like.

469
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,700
No pressure.

470
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,854
His book is cool, indeed.

471
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:23,849
Impressed me.

472
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:50,849
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks.

473
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:53,085
Have a soup
waiting for me at home.

474
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,267
The maid.

475
00:37:54,532 --> 00:37:55,564
Can not be.

476
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,750
- Another beer?
- Sure.

477
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:13,501
- What brings you around here?
- A Book ... a bird.

478
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:15,500
A book about a bird.

479
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:17,192
A book of search.

480
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:21,693
My wife makes a
good fish stock.

481
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,903
Not a very
alleged fish broth.

482
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:28,941
You can expect more
corn than fish.

483
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:35,831
I can open Lorrain
12 oysters in a minute and a half.

484
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:37,903
This kind of local oyster?

485
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:39,017
This same.

486
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,452
My wife can
open and save a life

487
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:42,672
during a song.

488
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,779
- Song, you say?
- Song.

489
00:38:57,363 --> 00:38:58,873
Today is the little red hen.

490
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,901
The owner of the parade.

491
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:02,153
- It's everywhere.
- Yeah.

492
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:03,373
Worldwide.

493
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:06,667
- The above mentioned Alfred.
- It is the real name is Alfred.

494
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:10,434
In the book I'll call you
Horton's or ... Morton.

495
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,935
Anyway, he brought
with his own hands,

496
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:16,106
back from extinction.

497
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:17,279
Incredible!

498
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:20,953
Now it has eleven
eleven o'clock, but nobody cares.

499
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:25,292
and thanks to their love,
now has two hundred.

500
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:28,095
- The species is saved.
- Sage, Thank God.

501
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,277
But because the story
is a tragedy,

502
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:31,400
you do not imagine
what happened.

503
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,681
- What?
- Fire.

504
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,204
- No!
- Yes, the whole reservation.

505
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:39,216
Of course these little birds are not
the most intelligent in nature.

506
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,107
The only people sitting on the perch
no sense to run, fly.

507
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:49,494
You know, when the fire
ended only five birds were left.

508
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,306
Roast chickens.

509
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:56,779
What happened to the five?

510
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:01,215
A twinge of pain.
A twinge of pain.

511
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:04,749
It was left umazinha, you know?

512
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:12,687
Just a little something stupid.
A stupid little bird.

513
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:24,664
It is a true story.

514
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:28,352
Another round for
my friend here, Mike.

515
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:48,229
Chicken shit.

516
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:11,987
Oh, you made the soup.
Blessed Heart!

517
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:20,642
An act of great kindness,
but I can not express

518
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:21,991
what it means to me.

519
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,917
Well, no big deal.
It's just a soup.

520
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:28,916
You really are a beautiful girl.

521
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:31,689
You know, you really are
a beautiful child.

522
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,800
- And you're drunk.
- No, no ... Well, yes.

523
00:41:36,017 --> 00:41:39,408
Okay, I must go.
Today you took over.

524
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,456
You know who I am?
I'll tell you who I am.

525
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,919
Just in case you
be interested.

526
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:45,394
- This is who I am.
- What?

527
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:49,771
I am the only child of only child
the only child.

528
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,322
You know what that means?

529
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:52,829
No cousins?

530
00:41:53,115 --> 00:41:55,632
It means that I am
last of my blood.

531
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,769
The last of my kind.

532
00:41:58,256 --> 00:41:59,956
Right then,
has some children.

533
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:02,331
Said Nanny.

534
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,957
Ahh, if you know me.

535
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:11,362
Okay, are $ 60.
Pay and go to bed.

536
00:42:11,518 --> 00:42:14,985
I do not blame the doc.
You know, she is ... just ...

537
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,178
It's just a human mechanics.

538
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:19,445
She always has her hands
within a human being,

539
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:22,424
every day ...
is a machine, you know.

540
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:23,866
A machine that does not break.

541
00:42:24,704 --> 00:42:26,112
As a machine factory.

542
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:30,331
How to create life,
I could stand up and lie down.

543
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,016
I understand.

544
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:36,255
I do not blame you, but ...

545
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,267
Hey, sorry.

546
00:42:39,813 --> 00:42:42,852
Is.
Is it ...

547
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:48,098
She does not realize that
Humans are warm.

548
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:51,337
You know?
Need for contact,

549
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:52,748
need heat ...

550
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:56,589
You really are a beautiful girl.
You really are a beautiful child.

551
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,309
No, no, no!

552
00:43:05,393 --> 00:43:08,722
Damn!
I'll go.

553
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:21,940
Firefighter sucks.
How?

554
00:43:22,815 --> 00:43:24,282
I said he is lonely?

555
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:26,318
We are all lonely.

556
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:31,098
- I should go see it.
- No, you should not.

557
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,847
Okay, what do you prefer?

558
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:38,221
I do not want to play.

559
00:43:38,906 --> 00:43:40,057
Oh, come.

560
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:48,878
You prefer not to have
TV for a year,

561
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:52,472
or just be able to attend
the golf channel?

562
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,178
- The channel of golf.
- Me too.

563
00:43:58,368 --> 00:43:59,739
At least have the TV.

564
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:04,030
Your turn.

565
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,900
Right.

566
00:44:07,907 --> 00:44:10,302
You prefer not to have friends
or have parents?

567
00:44:42,441 --> 00:44:43,447
Claire?

568
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:45,665
Richard, the couch is
outside?

569
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:47,759
It is 15 days?

570
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:49,745
- You're right.
- Yes, I am.

571
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,887
Got soup in the kitchen.
You have made soup?

572
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,092
Be right back.

573
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,970
All right. You made soup.
That nanny?

574
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:08,745
And she's still here.

575
00:45:10,843 --> 00:45:13,447
Take it soon.
Right back there.

576
00:45:19,352 --> 00:45:21,073
You know what
fun to make soup?

577
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:24,617
You put the ingredients
for the sauce ...

578
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:29,405
- The sauce, o. .. sauce ...
- You mean the broth?

579
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:31,257
Okay, okay and then ...

580
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:33,498
just cook.

581
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:37,520
Richard has something wrong?

582
00:45:38,174 --> 00:45:40,426
I do not ...
I'm worried.

583
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:43,490
Oh, thanks for
your concern, Claire.

584
00:45:44,354 --> 00:45:46,298
Speaking of which.
How are your patients?

585
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:48,361
They are going well?

586
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:52,532
And what are their names?

587
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:59,069
- Do you have a bump right here.
- Oh, you know, is life.

588
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:01,041
Winds of change.

589
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:04,582
Anyway I want
unpack some boxes.

590
00:46:04,673 --> 00:46:07,750
If you want to have a snack.

591
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:17,015
- Oh, no, Richard. All of these?
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:20,714
Why? Why is
doing this to yourself?

593
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:23,487
Well, I'm just beginning
my second life.

594
00:46:23,966 --> 00:46:28,795
Getting ready to write
a memorable book.

595
00:46:28,894 --> 00:46:31,142
I can not import from my
first novel did not sell.

596
00:46:32,828 --> 00:46:34,719
Richard, I can not
agree with you.

597
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:37,242
Oh, no, no, no.
This will motivate me, really.

598
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:55,495
- That was amazing.
- Hey, I have to outwit.

599
00:46:55,587 --> 00:46:56,892
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

600
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:58,627
My super-senses
are telling me something.

601
00:46:58,628 --> 00:46:59,628
What?

602
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:02,308
I think Dr.
will get sick.

603
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,525
Shut up.

604
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,020
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

605
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,149
Damn!
What do you want?

606
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:16,034
I came to see if you are well.

607
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,156
- Because if you are ...
- I'm fine.

608
00:47:18,274 --> 00:47:19,534
You need to go.

609
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:20,645
What?

610
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:22,379
You need to go now.

611
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:24,909
Would you also.

612
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,550
And it was you who gave up on me.

613
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:28,878
Incidentally.

614
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:31,838
What?

615
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:33,595
Last night.

616
00:47:34,428 --> 00:47:36,306
Your asshole.
I just wanted to apologize.

617
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:39,208
For hitting you,
but forget it, idiot.

618
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:42,900
Wait!
Abby?

619
00:47:43,284 --> 00:47:46,719
She is leaving the bath.
And voila.

620
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,875
- Richard, who was it?
- A girl scout.

621
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,303
A girl scout.

622
00:47:54,814 --> 00:47:56,033
Oh, okay.

623
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:07,016
Horton saw his loneliness
as sacred.

624
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:12,939
Horton? Norton? Norwood?
Norwood!

625
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:16,304
Norwood saw his loneliness
something like ... Oh!

626
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:28,859
How's it going?

627
00:48:34,593 --> 00:48:36,991
Norwood saw his loneliness
something like ...

628
00:48:43,377 --> 00:48:45,592
Richard, what is it?

629
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:47,844
The sole.

630
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:50,811
- In what sense?
- The fish is called the sole.

631
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:52,625
The water here is full of them.

632
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:55,375
Oh! And what is
planning to do with it?

633
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:57,583
I have to have a plan,

634
00:48:57,653 --> 00:48:59,802
just because I have a fish at home?

635
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,438
Okay, okay.
Sorry.

636
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:02,833
I thought
we cook it.

637
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:04,439
And then eat it.
How about this?

638
00:49:04,514 --> 00:49:07,782
I did not know the fact that you
was cooking now.

639
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:52,528
Okay, stop, stop, please.
Stop immediately.

640
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:55,238
Stop, stop, stop please!

641
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,239
Stop!

642
00:50:23,278 --> 00:50:24,311
Abby!

643
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,972
Who the hell is that?

644
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:40,761
I have not had a chance to pay it
that other night.

645
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:42,574
- Those sixty.
- Stay with them.

646
00:50:42,674 --> 00:50:44,253
You have not had dinner, then ...

647
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:49,675
I think there was a misunderstanding
about my behavior,

648
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:53,005
my intentions.
Certainly, that was not.

649
00:50:53,074 --> 00:50:55,547
Whatever. I'm sure
you're sorry.

650
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:58,380
I'm sorry,
actually about.

651
00:50:58,436 --> 00:51:00,634
I'm sorry to have it
abruptly dismissed

652
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:02,419
- House ...
- His wife was there.

653
00:51:02,545 --> 00:51:05,077
- Yeah, I thought she was there.
- Yeah, she was there.

654
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,755
- It would be inconvenient, you know?
- No, actually I do not know.

655
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:12,606
Well, Claire does not understand our ...

656
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:15,244
Our what?

657
00:51:18,482 --> 00:51:19,755
Our friendship.

658
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:26,663
Abby!

659
00:51:26,998 --> 00:51:28,333
Come!
We're already going.

660
00:51:28,427 --> 00:51:33,340
Anyway, I wanted
I knew about you e. ..

661
00:51:35,197 --> 00:51:36,629
This is the chicken?

662
00:51:39,036 --> 00:51:40,707
- Is
- It's a good-looking.

663
00:51:40,784 --> 00:51:42,316
Yeah, Richard.
I think it is.

664
00:51:44,052 --> 00:51:47,211
Are you coming or not?
We do not have all day.

665
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:49,808
- Just a minute.
- I'm Richard.

666
00:51:50,554 --> 00:51:53,158
Look, you said to connect
when I was in the hole.

667
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:55,531
Okay, Abby.
Do not want to hold it.

668
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:58,923
Not the guy's bike?

669
00:51:59,336 --> 00:52:03,127
Abby has been babysitting for me.
How about Wednesday night?

670
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:06,072
Sure.

671
00:52:07,384 --> 00:52:09,158
Damn, girl!
Move that ass!

672
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:13,738
Sorry.

673
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,568
He was not following you?

674
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:38,050
Richard?

675
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:50,202
- Richard, are you here?
- I'm going there.

676
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:54,269
Do not.

677
00:52:58,784 --> 00:53:00,472
Hey.
How are you?

678
00:53:00,658 --> 00:53:03,179
- Come, let's output it.
- Great! Okay.

679
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:12,735
I have a problem
with my hands.

680
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:15,028
What do you mean?

681
00:53:15,338 --> 00:53:17,044
They do not want to do what
I want them to do.

682
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,744
What do you want them to do?

683
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:21,391
Anything I do not know.

684
00:53:21,454 --> 00:53:25,018
Anything useful.
Build something or ...

685
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,169
do something.

686
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,217
Like what?

687
00:53:27,531 --> 00:53:30,152
Even Jesus, that is,
He was a carpenter.

688
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:32,714
It was not enough just
save humanity

689
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,090
he needed a tray.

690
00:53:34,342 --> 00:53:40,465
- I am a man without substance.
- Well, compared to Jesus ...

691
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:44,683
- I am a man of paper.
- Yeah, you're a writer.

692
00:53:44,994 --> 00:53:48,493
- Big difference.
- Yeah, it is.

693
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:54,056
Arrived.

694
00:53:55,363 --> 00:53:56,519
Where?

695
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,343
It is possible that the sea

696
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:03,743
life and earth suddenly born,

697
00:54:03,806 --> 00:54:05,977
as though they were
see the sea again.

698
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:08,901
Someone wrote that?
I wrote this.

699
00:54:11,493 --> 00:54:12,729
Hold that.

700
00:54:21,484 --> 00:54:22,539
Abby?

701
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:27,197
Abby?

702
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:29,886
Abby?

703
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:35,963
Come!

704
00:54:36,928 --> 00:54:37,964
Abby?

705
00:54:39,524 --> 00:54:40,651
Abby?

706
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:48,025
Jesus!
What are you doing?

707
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:51,079
What are you doing?

708
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:04,391
You can not do that.

709
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:06,276
Can not do that.

710
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:27,899
It was me.
I had to have gone.

711
00:55:32,547 --> 00:55:33,962
It was very cold.

712
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:39,213
It was much, much colder
than today, but ...

713
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,615
know, she was stubborn
like me.

714
00:55:45,085 --> 00:55:46,492
Have you noticed that.

715
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,163
And I went into the water.

716
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,770
I do not know why she came.

717
00:55:56,969 --> 00:55:58,563
She was close e. ..

718
00:56:00,467 --> 00:56:02,674
I think maybe
feel warmer.

719
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,654
And she was laughing.

720
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:19,298
And you know.

721
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,520
She was right.

722
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:25,163
And she was up.

723
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:29,235
And she was calm.

724
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:39,040
Only sank and disappeared e. ..

725
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:43,985
I just stood up there.

726
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:50,472
And in a few hours
My mother came.

727
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:54,099
I think with me,
you know.

728
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:58,907
And swam back, but ...

729
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:02,437
she never did.

730
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:05,817
For how long?

731
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:07,930
She needed me.

732
00:57:09,129 --> 00:57:10,285
We were twins.

733
00:57:10,753 --> 00:57:14,789
Oh!
Oh, my God!

734
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,648
It was a long time ago.

735
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,885
I go there every year.
Swim back to shore.

736
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:26,475
I like to feel the cold.

737
00:57:29,252 --> 00:57:34,437
You must ...
I do not know what to say.

738
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:39,936
So we were both together.

739
00:57:56,328 --> 00:57:57,844
It was our ritual.

740
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:01,048
Every year, you knew that.

741
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:04,522
And you took that guy there.

742
00:58:06,595 --> 00:58:07,811
That day.

743
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,876
He even met her.

744
00:58:12,231 --> 00:58:13,249
I know.

745
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,625
Remember when I was the only
he talked to you?

746
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:18,779
For a long time.

747
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:21,060
I know, but ...

748
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:22,688
He does not love you.

749
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,249
What you think is wrong.

750
00:58:26,613 --> 00:58:27,970
What do you want me to say?

751
00:58:28,184 --> 00:58:30,157
I think we should
move to California.

752
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:33,375
Do not think that'll be
always available

753
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,831
because one day ...
I might not be.

754
00:58:35,935 --> 00:58:38,059
God!
Stop it.

755
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:40,861
Is this what you want?

756
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,403
I do not have much
history, have?

757
00:58:51,934 --> 00:58:53,176
That is relative.

758
00:58:53,527 --> 00:58:54,527
Exactly.

759
00:58:55,496 --> 00:58:57,246
Other people have memories.

760
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,955
Things happen to them.

761
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,310
All kinds of occurrences.

762
00:59:00,892 --> 00:59:02,186
I used to do things.

763
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,905
Remember?
This is not about you.

764
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:07,590
Amazing things.

765
00:59:09,707 --> 00:59:10,892
What do you want me to say?

766
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:11,965
I know not of.

767
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:15,640
No. Tell me what
you want me to say,

768
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:17,481
because frankly
I have nothing.

769
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:20,452
Come here.

770
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:29,340
This is not to its implementation,
Richard, nor of their work.

771
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:31,779
You are unhappy because trz
unhappiness to his brothers.

772
00:59:44,783 --> 00:59:47,765
Has a charity event to
children in the hospital tomorrow.

773
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:53,343
and I am thinking of donating a
bottle of Chateau Petrus 1971.

774
00:59:53,467 --> 00:59:55,585
I know I was saving
for a special occasion,

775
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,303
but for what? So ...
What do you think?

776
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:04,814
Richard, did you drink that wine?

777
01:00:04,937 --> 01:00:07,749
That bottle of wine
five thousand dollars?

778
01:00:07,815 --> 01:00:10,360
Not because of me.
It is because of children.

779
01:00:10,843 --> 01:00:12,280
You can call me, please?

780
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:20,922
Join!

781
01:00:26,988 --> 01:00:30,470
- Wow, look at that couch!
- You like it?

782
01:00:31,893 --> 01:00:34,453
- Which I did with it.
- Very good!

783
01:00:34,643 --> 01:00:36,819
- It's amazing!
- Yeah, sit, sit, sit.

784
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:48,032
- It's comfortable.
- Oh, are ideas for titles.

785
01:00:49,174 --> 01:00:50,185
For his new book?

786
01:00:50,766 --> 01:00:51,958
Cool, what do you have?

787
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:59,736
Dark game.
Death and Desolation.

788
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:05,953
Death and the Account.
Memoirs of an Amnestic.

789
01:01:08,518 --> 01:01:10,669
- Bolero.
- Bolero?

790
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,670
Right.

791
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:13,358
Ad nauseum.

792
01:01:13,891 --> 01:01:15,013
Almost Silence.

793
01:01:15,014 --> 01:01:16,030
No?

794
01:01:16,141 --> 01:01:18,094
Pictures of a Blackberry Wine.

795
01:01:18,298 --> 01:01:22,327
Forget it.
Titles are impossible.

796
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:26,109
Man Paper.

797
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,203
You seem much more
interesting than me.

798
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:55,069
I'm not.

799
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:57,377
Just because I look like
one sister dead.

800
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,540
- Where have you been all day?
- I do not know.

801
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,200
No matter.

802
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:05,458
The party in office this
weekend failed

803
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,834
because of their mother.

804
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:12,424
- And the cave?
- It's very cold there.

805
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:16,552
- Big deal did not party.
- What kind of party?

806
01:02:16,678 --> 01:02:18,705
What kind of party?
Fucking party.

807
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:21,864
- It's nothing, just friends.
- They can use my house.

808
01:02:23,074 --> 01:02:24,143
What?

809
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:26,572
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

810
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:29,894
This weekend is not good,
because my wife back, but

811
01:02:29,972 --> 01:02:31,941
may be next week.
Friday?

812
01:02:32,204 --> 01:02:33,538
Friday is legal.

813
01:02:34,332 --> 01:02:35,471
- Really?
- Yeah.

814
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:39,445
- I get the barrel.
- Legal ... cool.

815
01:02:39,611 --> 01:02:40,733
What most guys need?

816
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,828
Snacks, paper plates,
these things?

817
01:02:42,984 --> 01:02:47,155
No, no, no. We're fine.
We have coverage.

818
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,608
Great.
All over.

819
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,299
Okay, thanks, man.

820
01:03:01,661 --> 01:03:04,720
- No need to do that.
- It'll be fun.

821
01:03:17,802 --> 01:03:18,879
Richard?

822
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:21,818
Richard?

823
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,630
Richard, please?

824
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
Hi

825
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:34,910
When the world
is in danger.

826
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:37,710
When evil is around you.

827
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:38,907
When danger ...

828
01:03:39,261 --> 01:03:40,279
All right?

829
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,280
- Richard, help me.
- You did not like?

830
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:51,247
All furniture is
outside e. ..

831
01:03:51,972 --> 01:03:53,404
What the hell is that?

832
01:03:53,966 --> 01:03:56,265
You seem disappointed,
by its figurative language.

833
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:58,869
You have not answered the phone
Not once this week.

834
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:59,870
You know?

835
01:03:59,871 --> 01:04:01,120
Do not call me even once.

836
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:04,121
I travel all the way
up here and see it.

837
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,745
Richard, say something.

838
01:04:07,402 --> 01:04:08,792
Well, I ...

839
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:21,154
- What is it?
- What is what?

840
01:04:21,264 --> 01:04:22,672
That?
Whose is it?

841
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:24,790
Richard, tell her.

842
01:04:25,967 --> 01:04:27,547
- Claire?
- Yes?

843
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:34,590
We are unhappy or
only pretend to be unhappy?

844
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,400
What do you mean?

845
01:04:36,432 --> 01:04:38,774
We're just
pretending to be unhappy,

846
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:41,079
like dramatizing
our lives?

847
01:04:41,182 --> 01:04:44,205
Wanting to make it appear
that have more substance?

848
01:04:45,204 --> 01:04:46,453
I mean, think about it:

849
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:48,650
Our lives are
embarrassingly simple.

850
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,842
We are full of money.

851
01:04:49,843 --> 01:04:50,943
We have friends.

852
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,140
Well, you have friends.

853
01:04:52,215 --> 01:04:54,815
There are people out there who
have real problems.

854
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:55,816
You know?

855
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:59,025
Real reasons to be unhappy.

856
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:03,585
You could be a dying mining
in darkness, or something.

857
01:05:03,673 --> 01:05:06,928
You could be a bitch to
Cincinnati paying basket.

858
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:08,117
What?
- I do not know.

859
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:11,950
Do not feel like
was a hoax

860
01:05:12,681 --> 01:05:14,054
that our unhappiness?

861
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,616
No.

862
01:05:18,336 --> 01:05:19,589
No.
It's true.

863
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:21,053
It is very true.

864
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:26,638
I'm going home now.

865
01:05:32,772 --> 01:05:35,740
I think you think
that's still charming.

866
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:37,715
We have over 23 years.

867
01:05:37,795 --> 01:05:39,365
You have come to.

868
01:05:40,525 --> 01:05:41,962
Pick up the phone this week.

869
01:05:44,324 --> 01:05:47,364
And get the lawn furniture!

870
01:06:02,145 --> 01:06:04,959
Norwood believes his loneliness
something like ...

871
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:09,177
Norwood? Norman? Richmond?
Richmond!

872
01:06:11,198 --> 01:06:13,176
Richmond sees his loneliness
something like ...

873
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,676
- Richmond?
- Richmond.

874
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:21,738
Schimithmond?
Schimithmond!

875
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,240
Richmond sees his loneliness
something like ...

876
01:06:30,241 --> 01:06:31,295
Oh!

877
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:33,730
Unbearable!

878
01:06:34,134 --> 01:06:35,447
Richmond sees his loneliness
something like ...

879
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:37,313
Unbearable!

880
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:45,123
Richmond sees his loneliness
something like ... unbearable.

881
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:21,791
Scalpel.

882
01:07:25,588 --> 01:07:27,977
You got too high.
Gotta go here below,

883
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:31,777
to the base of the head
and cut around it, good.

884
01:07:32,663 --> 01:07:33,973
Beware, beware, beware.

885
01:07:34,464 --> 01:07:35,912
Let me help you.

886
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:37,315
All right.

887
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:43,636
Good, good, good.

888
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:50,113
Right.
Do you prefer ...

889
01:07:51,746 --> 01:07:55,714
always go back or
being stabbed in the next step?

890
01:07:56,404 --> 01:07:57,800
Because I would have
want one?

891
01:07:58,048 --> 01:07:59,716
It's a game, just choose one.

892
01:08:02,934 --> 01:08:07,767
Oh, throw in a skillet.
Beautiful!

893
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,371
You are really good at it.

894
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:11,268
My wife also
argued that today.

895
01:08:13,116 --> 01:08:14,533
You should be a
fish merchant.

896
01:08:14,617 --> 01:08:17,031
You know, selling fish.

897
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,208
What do you prefer,
walking backwards

898
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:20,555
or take a stab
the next step?

899
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:23,232
I could draw
special shoes or ...

900
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:24,305
No.

901
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:29,276
You must turn in a minute.
Softly, softly.

902
01:08:29,816 --> 01:08:32,500
I think I prefer
walk backwards,

903
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,469
I'm no good to feel pain.
And you?

904
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:37,282
I like to see where I'm going.

905
01:08:43,365 --> 01:08:45,015
Right.
Come here.

906
01:08:46,907 --> 01:08:48,149
Hold that.

907
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:56,967
- Oh, men of paper.
- You know, for your book.

908
01:08:57,647 --> 01:09:02,125
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I have something for you too.

909
01:09:02,627 --> 01:09:04,047
Is.
Close your eyes.

910
01:09:15,092 --> 01:09:16,153
Oh!

911
01:09:17,246 --> 01:09:19,185
A camel?

912
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:21,652
A peacock?

913
01:09:22,217 --> 01:09:26,219
It's a swan.
The beautiful and graceful swan.

914
01:09:26,925 --> 01:09:28,247
Sorry.

915
01:09:29,705 --> 01:09:30,834
Oh!

916
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:02,964
Enters.

917
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:15,673
- We are beautiful.
- Yeah.

918
01:10:16,183 --> 01:10:18,986
Wow, you really
spent high.

919
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:20,963
Is.
Is exaggerated?

920
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
No.

921
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:23,620
No.
You are great.

922
01:10:24,856 --> 01:10:26,017
The feast is ready.

923
01:10:26,183 --> 01:10:28,996
Barrels are here and the appetizers
in order in the kitchen.

924
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:30,486
I think it will flow
this way.

925
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:32,440
Oh, this is a piata?

926
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,620
Yeah, I did a stupid.
It's classic.

927
01:10:38,737 --> 01:10:40,555
You do not like much
parties, like?

928
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:41,910
No.
I get a little nervous.

929
01:10:42,398 --> 01:10:44,120
Oh, relax.
It'll be fun.

930
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:45,121
Okay.

931
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:49,361
No!

932
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:52,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

933
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:56,425
- Shit.
- I know.

934
01:10:58,513 --> 01:11:01,278
- Where is the refrigerator?
- Do not play the asshole.

935
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:04,429
- Whats up?
- Whats up, dude!

936
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,410
- Where do I put this?
- In the kitchen.

937
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:11,641
- And the boxes?
- Any place, man.

938
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,742
Any place that feel good?

939
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:15,485
- Es mi casa, you know?
- What?

940
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,300
Right.

941
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:22,269
Where are the cups.

942
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,162
Hey!

943
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,582
Welcome to party central.

944
01:11:33,693 --> 01:11:34,926
Whatever it is.

945
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,526
Hey!
Hey!

946
01:11:39,114 --> 01:11:40,600
Let me move away a little.

947
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:42,758
Anybody want to join the party?

948
01:11:48,032 --> 01:11:49,373
Come, come.

949
01:11:51,393 --> 01:11:52,669
Today is my day!

950
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,076
Hey.

951
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:12,950
Tim-tim!

952
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:48,555
High School for me was
a time of self-discovery.

953
01:12:50,552 --> 01:12:52,873
When I look back
I'm sad.

954
01:12:53,297 --> 01:12:56,140
You would not want
17 years again, uhm?

955
01:12:59,756 --> 01:13:01,625
We have 15.

956
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,363
Oh!
Sorry.

957
01:14:19,919 --> 01:14:21,779
- Do you care?
- What are you doing?

958
01:14:22,394 --> 01:14:24,373
- What?
- What are you doing?

959
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:25,511
What about Abby?

960
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:26,999
Goodbye, Abby.

961
01:14:27,124 --> 01:14:29,592
Can not do that
with that little girl.

962
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:31,746
Cherish your life,
you pervert.

963
01:14:31,998 --> 01:14:33,142
Chicken shit.

964
01:14:34,089 --> 01:14:36,542
- Do you call me?
- Chicken shit bastard.

965
01:14:37,312 --> 01:14:38,951
Can not talk to me like that.

966
01:14:42,435 --> 01:14:44,925
Do not talk to me like that,
its fucking weird.

967
01:14:45,017 --> 01:14:46,904
You think I can
afraid, her big baby.

968
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:50,832
Criano, huh?
That's what I am?

969
01:14:51,027 --> 01:14:53,654
Leave him alone!
What are you doing?

970
01:14:53,776 --> 01:14:54,839
Stop it!

971
01:14:55,589 --> 01:14:57,404
- Are you okay?
- What is the problem?

972
01:14:57,541 --> 01:14:59,244
What is the problem?
You're making out with him?

973
01:14:59,324 --> 01:15:01,360
- Stop!
- Is having sex with her?

974
01:15:01,432 --> 01:15:02,465
No!

975
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:03,652
I do not give a damn.

976
01:15:03,716 --> 01:15:05,775
You can stick with it.
She is crazy.

977
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:08,204
Why do not you back
Your mama bear

978
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:09,341
you belong.

979
01:15:09,515 --> 01:15:10,672
And take it with you!

980
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,085
Get out of here!

981
01:15:13,405 --> 01:15:14,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

982
01:15:14,756 --> 01:15:18,014
Get out of here!
Now! Go!

983
01:15:20,476 --> 01:15:22,406
What are you looking at?
Go away from here!

984
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:24,266
The party is over.

985
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:29,013
Chicken shit.

986
01:15:29,122 --> 01:15:30,328
He is an asshole.

987
01:15:32,759 --> 01:15:33,796
Is.

988
01:15:37,517 --> 01:15:38,784
Great party?

989
01:15:40,843 --> 01:15:41,920
Is.

990
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:48,608
I love you.

991
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:53,021
What?

992
01:15:55,315 --> 01:16:01,097
Well .. uh ... a
appropriate manner.

993
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,858
I want to know.

994
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:11,366
I discovered when I examined

995
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:15,774
my heart, I thought ...

996
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:22,855
I think there's love there.

997
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:26,418
For you.

998
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,042
Is.

999
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:34,502
I love you.

1000
01:16:47,038 --> 01:16:49,600
Not true love.

1001
01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:58,845
You're only here a few months.

1002
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:05,539
My parents thought ...

1003
01:17:09,174 --> 01:17:10,485
I know not of.

1004
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:16,268
I never told them.

1005
01:17:19,952 --> 01:17:21,173
Never ...

1006
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,296
I told this not once.

1007
01:17:26,848 --> 01:17:28,288
It was a pact.

1008
01:17:36,273 --> 01:17:41,115
Amy and I decided to go.

1009
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:46,260
Enter the water and she ...

1010
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:52,115
unable to swim back.

1011
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:00,353
I swam back.

1012
01:18:03,386 --> 01:18:04,793
I could not.

1013
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,764
I do not know we were so unhappy.
I mean ...

1014
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:22,460
How could we be so unfortunate ...

1015
01:18:25,209 --> 01:18:26,730
with 8 years.

1016
01:18:32,261 --> 01:18:36,865
I think that age is not
had to worry about anything.

1017
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,521
He always takes the worst decisions.

1018
01:19:21,604 --> 01:19:22,986
The same with her.

1019
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,486
I feel useless.

1020
01:19:31,284 --> 01:19:32,550
How long is she with?

1021
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:34,877
Since she was 8.

1022
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,177
You?

1023
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:40,722
Oh, Christ, for over 40 years.

1024
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:45,082
Since the second grade.

1025
01:19:46,082 --> 01:19:47,688
He is not a little old
for you?

1026
01:19:48,142 --> 01:19:49,770
I keep telling him that.

1027
01:19:51,175 --> 01:19:52,506
He never listens.

1028
01:19:53,427 --> 01:19:55,003
He never heard?
- No.

1029
01:19:57,202 --> 01:19:58,463
What is your specialty?

1030
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:02,182
I've done it all.

1031
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:07,295
Monsters under the bed,
a cheerleader,

1032
01:20:08,309 --> 01:20:09,386
Captain.

1033
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:14,847
These days have not been
very true.

1034
01:20:14,901 --> 01:20:15,919
And you?

1035
01:20:16,014 --> 01:20:17,638
I'm madly
love with her.

1036
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:21,574
- Love's impossible!
- Yeah.

1037
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,448
It's getting worse.

1038
01:20:26,063 --> 01:20:27,812
She almost broke up with me.

1039
01:20:27,978 --> 01:20:32,217
Good Good
Run away while you can.

1040
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:37,070
Tell her to open
the door and run.

1041
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,196
You do not want to end up like me.

1042
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,814
I suppose not.

1043
01:20:47,626 --> 01:20:51,781
- Captain Excellent.
- Christopher.

1044
01:20:53,323 --> 01:20:54,633
Nice to meet you.

1045
01:20:56,062 --> 01:20:57,289
See you there.

1046
01:21:39,668 --> 01:21:40,981
Oh!

1047
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,219
What?

1048
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,157
What? What?

1049
01:21:49,233 --> 01:21:50,605
Wait a second.

1050
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,251
Puto.

1051
01:21:52,689 --> 01:21:54,920
- Do not react well here.
- Shut up.

1052
01:21:55,008 --> 01:21:56,243
Do not tell me how to react.

1053
01:21:56,321 --> 01:21:57,980
- Not at all.
- Shut up.

1054
01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:01,010
What?
What is it, Richard?

1055
01:22:01,103 --> 01:22:03,697
Who is this.
Who the hell is she?

1056
01:22:03,806 --> 01:22:05,086
She is the nanny.

1057
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,165
Get out.

1058
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:10,403
Get out!

1059
01:22:13,374 --> 01:22:14,917
Hi, Lucy!
Hi, Peter!

1060
01:22:16,145 --> 01:22:17,198
Hi

1061
01:22:18,169 --> 01:22:19,654
Claire we'll be ...

1062
01:22:22,678 --> 01:22:25,014
I did not sleep with the nanny,
if that's what you're thinking.

1063
01:22:25,211 --> 01:22:26,577
That is very comforting.

1064
01:22:26,952 --> 01:22:28,649
Why you need a babysitter?

1065
01:22:28,764 --> 01:22:31,447
It was just a beer, Claire.
That was all.

1066
01:22:31,734 --> 01:22:32,918
Only one beer.

1067
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:35,491
And who exactly
you did a beer? "

1068
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:37,044
Only high school kids.

1069
01:22:37,098 --> 01:22:38,676
Richard, stop it.

1070
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:40,898
- None of this is right.
- Okay.

1071
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:42,742
You knew I would
this weekend.

1072
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:44,199
Why are you doing this?

1073
01:22:44,272 --> 01:22:46,199
I was feeling
means failed.

1074
01:22:47,086 --> 01:22:48,459
This is a response of shit.

1075
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:51,051
I was charfundando
and Abby was being ...

1076
01:22:51,116 --> 01:22:52,659
What?
Abby was being what?

1077
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:54,597
A friend.

1078
01:22:54,793 --> 01:22:57,168
For God's sake, it is not
a friend, she is a child.

1079
01:22:57,241 --> 01:22:58,991
- You have friends.
- No, I do not.

1080
01:22:59,459 --> 01:23:03,663
- He looks like a squirrel?
- I think I have to agree.

1081
01:23:03,909 --> 01:23:06,099
You do not want to relate
with other human beings.

1082
01:23:06,885 --> 01:23:08,677
Isaiah
You're freezing.

1083
01:23:08,789 --> 01:23:11,054
- Look who's talking?
- What do you mean?

1084
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,650
You who are cold, Claire.

1085
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,211
I think we should leave.

1086
01:23:15,597 --> 01:23:16,925
We can get out of here?

1087
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:18,543
I mean, this area.

1088
01:23:20,377 --> 01:23:22,833
- Where?
- I do not know, anywhere.

1089
01:23:23,414 --> 01:23:26,614
- You cooled your heart.
- I can accept that.

1090
01:23:26,706 --> 01:23:28,110
I wanted a baby.

1091
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:31,047
It is what it is?

1092
01:23:31,111 --> 01:23:32,708
We could have a baby, Claire.

1093
01:23:32,913 --> 01:23:35,048
Why do not we have a baby.
Why?

1094
01:23:35,132 --> 01:23:36,633
Because you're a baby.

1095
01:23:36,766 --> 01:23:38,050
You're childish.

1096
01:23:38,393 --> 01:23:40,547
You still have an imaginary friend.

1097
01:23:40,644 --> 01:23:43,158
I just wanted something hot.

1098
01:23:43,297 --> 01:23:45,392
Someone simple that I could
be in the company.

1099
01:23:45,444 --> 01:23:48,735
A simple relationship
a person who was new and pure.

1100
01:23:48,915 --> 01:23:50,609
I could be me,
it might be it

1101
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:52,969
and everything we expected,
could be built.

1102
01:23:53,046 --> 01:23:56,672
In this world there
someone other than me

1103
01:23:56,738 --> 01:23:59,006
for me to think and worry.

1104
01:23:59,657 --> 01:24:04,797
The relief of being able to give
another person to the world

1105
01:24:04,879 --> 01:24:06,798
and let it happen.

1106
01:24:06,893 --> 01:24:08,943
Let her take your time.

1107
01:24:09,955 --> 01:24:14,878
- Then not only would I?
- Then not only would you?

1108
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:17,672
- When I enter?
- What do you mean?

1109
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:19,516
God, you're the mother.

1110
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:27,830
Ah, we're sorry.
We already go, we'll have ...

1111
01:24:27,892 --> 01:24:31,193
You want to go somewhere?
Anywhere.

1112
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:33,471
- Sorry.
- No. All right.

1113
01:24:33,642 --> 01:24:35,786
- We just wanted ...
- I'll take them, sorry.

1114
01:24:35,827 --> 01:24:37,546
Take them to a cruise
or something.

1115
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:42,202
Okay.

1116
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,189
Okay.
Take care.

1117
01:25:11,448 --> 01:25:12,730
We will organize this.

1118
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,980
Okay. By the way how
old is she, 13, 14?

1119
01:25:16,423 --> 01:25:18,825
Let's at least the facts,
However, right?

1120
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,939
It was you who gave behind.
You did not want a baby.

1121
01:25:22,012 --> 01:25:24,999
It was not yet ready.
So his prayer fucked

1122
01:25:25,108 --> 01:25:27,322
in front of my friends here
was a bunch of crap

1123
01:25:28,073 --> 01:25:30,859
I know now I can not.

1124
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:34,797
So now I'm the bad girl.

1125
01:25:38,798 --> 01:25:39,946
No.
That's romance.

1126
01:25:39,947 --> 01:25:41,451
I prefer that you do not ...

1127
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:44,109
What is this?
What is this?

1128
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,782
That's it.

1129
01:25:47,918 --> 01:25:50,388
All this time and here's this?

1130
01:25:50,443 --> 01:25:51,480
That?

1131
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:54,762
Maybe you should spend time
instead of working ...

1132
01:25:55,044 --> 01:25:56,513
fucking the babysitter.

1133
01:25:56,637 --> 01:25:58,385
- No. I. ..
- You're useless.

1134
01:25:58,515 --> 01:26:01,222
- You are totally useless!
- Yeah. I am.

1135
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:02,910
What is wrong with you?

1136
01:26:02,982 --> 01:26:06,419
I do not know what to do
with my hands.

1137
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:16,562
Everyone.

1138
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:20,452
Janeth, my sister in life
made me laugh.

1139
01:26:20,548 --> 01:26:22,392
I was one that made me laugh.

1140
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,000
What's happening?

1141
01:26:24,048 --> 01:26:25,423
I do not know what
is happening.

1142
01:26:26,171 --> 01:26:27,673
You stopped laughing.

1143
01:27:29,282 --> 01:27:31,866
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1144
01:27:31,939 --> 01:27:33,616
I came here to pay my respects.

1145
01:27:33,817 --> 01:27:36,764
- How?
- The Heath Hen U.S..

1146
01:27:36,963 --> 01:27:40,001
It is here that the last lived and died.

1147
01:27:40,149 --> 01:27:42,843
I know nothing about the Heath Hen.

1148
01:27:44,126 --> 01:27:45,908
But you are welcome to
take a look around.

1149
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:47,969
We have a variety of seedlings.

1150
01:27:48,063 --> 01:27:49,126
Thank you.

1151
01:28:14,144 --> 01:28:16,551
So this is the end
something seems.

1152
01:28:16,767 --> 01:28:18,375
The world goes on, Richard.

1153
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:19,737
But it is never the same.

1154
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:22,728
We do not know how much has changed.
Only she was here.

1155
01:28:22,783 --> 01:28:24,133
The effect of waves.

1156
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:27,350
So as you well know,
just adjusting.

1157
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:28,424
Maybe.

1158
01:28:28,507 --> 01:28:29,549
Doomed.

1159
01:28:31,776 --> 01:28:33,486
I'm feeling like
a lost child

1160
01:28:33,568 --> 01:28:35,579
condemning you to
oblivion, Captain.

1161
01:28:35,987 --> 01:28:37,507
Chickie like that.

1162
01:28:42,237 --> 01:28:44,549
It's time to leave.

1163
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:46,851
No.

1164
01:28:47,702 --> 01:28:49,735
You know what
I mean, Captain.

1165
01:28:53,836 --> 01:28:57,247
I mean, go and
never to return.

1166
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:00,214
I'm not ready.

1167
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:02,384
No matter.

1168
01:29:03,134 --> 01:29:04,914
You can not help me anymore.

1169
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:08,633
The doctor is right.

1170
01:29:09,029 --> 01:29:10,354
You will be alone.

1171
01:29:10,821 --> 01:29:11,872
Yes

1172
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:14,402
The last of my kind.

1173
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:20,603
Right.

1174
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:26,115
Make your voice.

1175
01:29:27,823 --> 01:29:29,049
One last time.

1176
01:29:32,737 --> 01:29:33,855
Please.

1177
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,113
When the world is in danger.

1178
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:47,132
When evil is around you.

1179
01:29:49,269 --> 01:29:50,895
When danger is lurking.

1180
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:57,222
Who do you call?

1181
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,957
Captain Excellent!

1182
01:31:30,489 --> 01:31:37,489
I wish I had a
father as amazing as him.

1183
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:07,110
Captain?

1184
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:18,602
Richmond saw his loneliness
The ...

1185
01:32:18,772 --> 01:32:22,694
Merton saw his solitude ...
Norton saw his loneliness ...

1186
01:32:22,805 --> 01:32:25,044
Horton saw his loneliness ...
Norton thought ...

1187
01:32:26,022 --> 01:32:31,566
Norwood saw his loneliness
The ...

1188
01:32:32,286 --> 01:32:35,691
Richmond?
Richard?

1189
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:44,428
Richard!

1190
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:01,345
Richard felt his loneliness
the sacred.

1191
01:33:38,843 --> 01:33:42,705
Something has changed
last night e. ..

1192
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:44,278
you're at it.

1193
01:33:45,606 --> 01:33:46,927
Something interesting?

1194
01:33:48,811 --> 01:33:50,364
Do you actually.

1195
01:33:53,841 --> 01:33:55,330
You're living here.

1196
01:33:58,093 --> 01:33:59,123
Isaiah

1197
01:34:01,157 --> 01:34:02,606
You know, because of ...

1198
01:34:03,578 --> 01:34:05,950
- Situation ...
- Yeah.

1199
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,246
I think.

1200
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:14,439
You know, spring is ...

1201
01:34:15,731 --> 01:34:17,104
my favorite season.

1202
01:34:18,918 --> 01:34:21,107
The summer has not arrived yet.

1203
01:34:21,872 --> 01:34:23,340
Not so cold.

1204
01:34:27,502 --> 01:34:29,339
I. .. uh ...

1205
01:34:30,481 --> 01:34:32,106
I did something for you.

1206
01:34:45,407 --> 01:34:47,094
It is the swan.

1207
01:34:51,635 --> 01:34:53,885
The beautiful and graceful swan.

1208
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:58,026
It ...
Richard, is perfect.

1209
01:34:58,593 --> 01:35:00,138
Isaiah
Well ..

1210
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:03,502
Thank you.

1211
01:35:07,323 --> 01:35:11,140
It appears that Weaver just begun.

1212
01:35:17,939 --> 01:35:18,991
Take care.

1213
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:41,240
Okay.

1214
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,600
Okay.

1215
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:44,570
I am a horse.

1216
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:50,281
Yeah you are.

1217
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:55,548
Sorry.

1218
01:38:20,858 --> 01:38:23,472
I'll need help
to bring this couch.

1219
01:38:32,795 --> 01:38:35,891
Richard felt his loneliness
the sacred.

1220
01:38:36,315 --> 01:38:38,607
As a badge of honor.

1221
01:38:39,732 --> 01:38:42,756
A stove to keep
your life warm.

1222
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:44,452
As well as protection.

1223
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:47,893
Solitaire was all he was.

1224
01:38:48,027 --> 01:38:52,130
He made it into your life
because hardly satisfied.

1225
01:38:52,778 --> 01:38:55,129
Richard was sure
nobody liked him.

1226
01:38:55,214 --> 01:38:56,733
It was hard for the man.

1227
01:38:56,932 --> 01:39:00,965
Perhaps because he did not give anything
and did not receive anything in return.

1228
01:39:01,152 --> 01:39:04,568
In any case, the situation
became unbearable.

1229
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:09,539
All his friends were
imaginary or nonexistent.

1230
01:39:10,007 --> 01:39:11,808
Richard had reached
a point in your life

1231
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,663
I did not want anymore.

1232
01:39:16,474 --> 01:39:18,055
And then he met a girl.

1233
01:39:19,318 --> 01:39:20,659
And she was hot.

1234
01:39:21,307 --> 01:39:22,693
And she was sad.

1235
01:39:22,836 --> 01:39:26,569
And she was so lonesome
perhaps even remember him.

1236
01:39:27,728 --> 01:39:30,801
She lost things
no girl should miss.

1237
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,060
And she knew things.

1238
01:39:33,976 --> 01:39:35,377
And she told him.

1239
01:39:35,942 --> 01:39:39,816
And Richard thought it might be
so it seems a friendship.

1240
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,329
Maybe.

1241
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:53,656
It was all in the blink of an eye.

1242
01:39:54,915 --> 01:39:57,029
Just started actually.

1243
01:40:01,572 --> 01:40:04,414
But in those long
few days of winter.

1244
01:40:05,323 --> 01:40:06,914
She gave him so much.

1245
01:40:08,978 --> 01:40:11,416
Enough so
Richard could continue.

1246
01:40:18,664 --> 01:40:20,381
And what he gave her?

1247
01:40:22,571 --> 01:40:24,968
Just a few words on a page.

1248
01:40:26,663 --> 01:40:28,336
Not much, perhaps.

1249
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,435
But for Abby.

1250
01:40:33,124 --> 01:40:34,902
It was hope enough.

1251
01:41:19,036 --> 01:41:20,279
Okay.

1252
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:32,500
