1
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:00,543
Watch the birdie!

2
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:52,102
Come on, have something to drink with us.
Come on, drink with us.

3
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:54,897
Drink it, drink it...

4
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:46,449
Do you want gold?

5
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,204
Yes.

6
00:34:55,031 --> 00:35:00,244
You are excrement.
You can change yourself into gold.

7
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:43,788
You broke the looking glass.
Now break the stone.

8
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:08,854
Each stone has a soul,

9
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:13,150
formed by the work of millions of years.

10
00:36:16,237 --> 00:36:19,782
The tarot will teach you
how to create a soul.

11
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:12,394
To know.

12
00:38:25,282 --> 00:38:27,326
To dare.

13
00:38:40,214 --> 00:38:42,216
To want.

14
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:49,139
To be silent.

15
00:38:55,688 --> 00:38:59,191
The same force the vulture
uses to seize the ox

16
00:38:59,316 --> 00:39:03,070
is needed by the ox
to receive the vulture.

17
00:39:45,529 --> 00:39:50,910
The fish thinks about his hunger,
not about the fisherman.

18
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:57,333
It is the master
who seeks the disciple.

19
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,380
You want to know the secret,

20
00:40:03,505 --> 00:40:06,967
but man can achieve nothing
by himself.

21
00:40:07,092 --> 00:40:11,347
To accomplish the alchemical work,
you will have these companions.

22
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:14,767
They are thieves like you,
but on another level.

23
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:17,519
They are the most powerful people
on the planet.

24
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:21,148
Industrialists and politicians.

25
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:27,029
My name is Fon, my planet is Venus.

26
00:40:28,113 --> 00:40:32,701
My business is devoted to the comfort
and beauty of the human body -

27
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:37,581
beds, mattresses, fabrics,

28
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:40,876
clothing, cosmetics.

29
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:59,687
My father is the creator of this empire.

30
00:40:59,812 --> 00:41:04,149
He is deaf, dumb and blind.

31
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:09,488
Before making a decision,
he consults with my mother's mummy.

32
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:11,865
He puts his hand into her sex.

33
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:16,620
If it's moist, it's yes.
If it's dry, it's no.

34
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:23,544
These are my wives.

35
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:26,672
I make love to them
only during working hours.

36
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:31,635
They begin as workers,
then I promote them to secretaries.

37
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:34,800
We know that people want to be loved,

38
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:38,929
not for who they are
but for what they appear to be.

39
00:43:39,054 --> 00:43:41,932
So we have created a line of masks,

40
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:46,520
that have the texture,
warmth, and smell,

41
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:49,064
of living human beings.

42
00:43:49,898 --> 00:43:53,819
A customer can have any face
she wants.

43
00:43:53,944 --> 00:43:58,365
Every face is unique
and lasts a lifetime.

44
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,827
She can wear her artificial face
to the grave.

45
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:06,957
Our make-up department for corpses
eliminates the appearance of death.

46
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:09,126
Not only do we beautify cadavers,

47
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:12,671
we also equip them
with electronic devices.

48
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:15,757
They can kiss their family goodbye...

49
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:25,559
...participate in their own last rites...

50
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:33,192
...or give a live show.

51
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:50,292
My name is Isla, my planet is Mars.

52
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,768
Every morning I wake up
my male secretaries.

53
00:46:40,902 --> 00:46:44,156
I manufacture and sell weapons.

54
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,704
We produce bombers,
hydrogen bombs,

55
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:53,999
ray guns, deadly bacteria,

56
00:46:54,124 --> 00:47:00,255
anti-matter waves,
carcinogenic gases, etcetera.

57
00:47:12,726 --> 00:47:17,189
We are experimenting with a drug
to create delusions of grandeur.

58
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:22,652
Another drug turns harmless people
into wild beasts.

59
00:47:39,878 --> 00:47:44,091
The young generation needs arms
for its marches and sit-ins.

60
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,813
We have psychedelic shotguns...

61
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:01,733
...grenade necklaces...

62
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:04,861
...rock and roll weapons...

63
00:48:06,488 --> 00:48:08,490
...mystical weapons for Buddhists...

64
00:48:09,324 --> 00:48:10,867
...Jews...

65
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,454
...and Christians.

66
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:22,504
My name is Klen,
my planet is Jupiter.

67
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:25,841
My house.

68
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:33,849
My wife.

69
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:26,776
My chauffeur.

70
00:49:44,836 --> 00:49:46,421
- My lover.
- Hi!

71
00:49:46,546 --> 00:49:48,715
A thousand a week.

72
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,566
My art factory.

73
00:50:52,946 --> 00:50:55,824
We produce a new line of art
every season.

74
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:01,681
We created a love machine.

75
00:52:01,806 --> 00:52:05,352
To make it live the spectator
has to work with it, guide it,

76
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:08,730
receive it,
give himself in the act of love.

77
00:52:08,855 --> 00:52:13,693
With this electronic rod
he will rub its mechanical vagina.

78
00:52:13,818 --> 00:52:19,074
The skill of the spectator will determine
the machine's ability to reach a climax.

79
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,941
My chauffeur is a bad lover.

80
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:55,193
He didn't know how to satisfy it.

81
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:58,405
But this woman,
I know her techniques very well,

82
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,740
will produce the electronic orgasm.

83
00:53:00,865 --> 00:53:02,826
Frigid!

84
00:54:15,064 --> 00:54:19,235
My name is Sel, my planet is Saturn.

85
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,322
My customers are children.

86
00:57:03,816 --> 00:57:07,195
We manufacture war toys.

87
00:57:30,802 --> 00:57:34,931
Workers needed in the miniature
plastic bomb shop.

88
00:57:50,029 --> 00:57:52,657
We have an electronic computer

89
00:57:52,782 --> 00:57:55,910
programmed with the politics
of the government.

90
00:57:56,703 --> 00:57:58,955
The government is our client.

91
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:08,881
We feed the computer data
on coming wars and revolutions.

92
00:58:09,966 --> 00:58:13,177
It tells us what kind of toys to produce

93
00:58:13,302 --> 00:58:15,805
to condition children from birth.

94
00:58:18,558 --> 00:58:21,102
For example,
if the government calculates

95
00:58:21,227 --> 00:58:24,480
that it will be necessary
to wage war against Peru,

96
00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:27,942
our machine studies the Peruvians
and tells us what to do.

97
00:58:31,529 --> 00:58:35,992
We manufacture hyper-sexed
brown native vampires,

98
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:39,871
who can only be destroyed
by a cross the color of white skin.

99
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:43,291
We create a laxative
that induces vomiting.

100
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:48,087
We name it after the capital of Peru
and tint it with the color of the natives.

101
00:58:48,212 --> 00:58:50,590
We started a comic book campaign.

102
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:18,451
For 15 years in advance,

103
00:59:18,576 --> 00:59:22,538
we condition children
to hate the future enemy.

104
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:04,705
In 15 years these children
will go off to war,

105
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:08,126
to kill Peruvians with pleasure.

106
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,967
My name is Berg,
my planet is Uranus.

107
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:45,473
Our window is the wrong size,

108
01:01:45,598 --> 01:01:47,391
I don't like it.

109
01:01:47,516 --> 01:01:53,439
Berg, why do we have
that enormous hole in the wall?

110
01:01:53,564 --> 01:01:55,691
Close it up!

111
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:31,018
Our little baby is hungry.

112
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:41,339
- Have you finished the report?
- No.

113
01:04:03,235 --> 01:04:07,031
The president wants the report.
Hurry up! Hurry!

114
01:04:25,424 --> 01:04:28,219
I am financial adviser to the president.

115
01:04:49,865 --> 01:04:52,034
To save the country's economy,

116
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:57,164
we must eliminate four million citizens
in the next five years.

117
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:05,548
Begin the operations
of the gas chambers,

118
01:05:05,673 --> 01:05:10,219
gas schools, gas universities,
gas libraries, gas museums,

119
01:05:10,344 --> 01:05:13,514
gas dance halls,
and gas whore houses, etcetera.

120
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:23,125
I hate you! I hate you...!

121
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:30,591
My name is Axon, my planet is Neptune.

122
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:33,093
I am the chief of police.

123
01:07:40,411 --> 01:07:43,289
This is the most beautiful day
of your life.

124
01:07:43,414 --> 01:07:48,502
Of your own free will you came
to surrender part of your body to me.

125
01:07:48,627 --> 01:07:51,630
You decided to undergo the initiation

126
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:57,386
that 999
other heroes have passed.

127
01:08:06,312 --> 01:08:13,027
Your sacrifice completes my
sanctuary of one thousand testicles.

128
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:31,462
This is the holy book.
Learn to believe in me.

129
01:10:54,938 --> 01:10:59,651
Axon is the truth and the power
and the light...

130
01:11:05,949 --> 01:11:10,329
My name is Lut, my planet is Pluto.

131
01:11:10,454 --> 01:11:12,873
My business is architecture.

132
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,929
Where is he?

133
01:11:27,054 --> 01:11:30,474
He's there, he's there!

134
01:11:30,599 --> 01:11:32,392
No, no he's not!

135
01:11:44,404 --> 01:11:47,991
He's up there. There he is!
He's up there!

136
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:54,289
Go get him!
Come on, let's go get him!

137
01:11:55,624 --> 01:11:57,751
Where is he?

138
01:12:03,298 --> 01:12:05,133
There he is!

139
01:12:12,307 --> 01:12:16,520
When we built this multi-family complex,
we made a big mistake -

140
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:18,897
we lost money.

141
01:12:20,148 --> 01:12:22,442
We gave them
small gardens and windows,

142
01:12:22,568 --> 01:12:25,445
we installed water, lighting,
and heating systems.

143
01:12:25,571 --> 01:12:28,073
This was a wrong concept.

144
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:33,287
A man doesn't need a home,
all he needs is a shelter.

145
01:12:33,412 --> 01:12:37,666
If we can sell him on the idea
of a shelter, we can make millions.

146
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:04,026
A worker will come here only to sleep,
he won't need electricity or water.

147
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:08,071
He won't have to cook,
we'll condition him to eat at the factory.

148
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:14,161
These are communal latrine trucks
for the entire building.

149
01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:00,535
You have power and money,
but you are mortal.

150
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:03,497
You know you cannot escape death.

151
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:06,500
But immortality can be obtained.

152
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:15,675
In old traditions they speak
of holy mountains.

153
01:16:16,593 --> 01:16:18,887
The Meru mountain of India.

154
01:16:21,807 --> 01:16:24,434
Mount Kunlun of the Taoists.

155
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:28,021
The Karakoram of the Himalaya.

156
01:16:29,564 --> 01:16:31,566
The mountain of the philosophers.

157
01:16:32,442 --> 01:16:34,820
The Rosicrucian mountain.

158
01:16:34,945 --> 01:16:38,115
The Cabalistic mountain
of San Juan De La Cruz.

159
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,284
There are many other holy mountains.

160
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:44,329
The legend is always the same.

161
01:16:44,454 --> 01:16:48,458
Nine Immortal men live on top
of the mountain.

162
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:51,545
From the highest peak
they direct our world.

163
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:56,258
They hold the secret
to the conquest of death.

164
01:16:56,383 --> 01:17:00,595
They are more
than 40,000 years old.

165
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,431
But they were once like ourselves.

166
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:06,768
If others have succeeded
in conquering death,

167
01:17:06,893 --> 01:17:09,604
why must we accept it?

168
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:13,859
I know where the Immortals live
and how to obtain their secret.

169
01:17:19,614 --> 01:17:22,701
In this ancient Rosicrucian manuscript,

170
01:17:22,826 --> 01:17:27,914
I found an etching of the Nine Immortals
and the place where they live.

171
01:17:28,039 --> 01:17:31,084
The holy mountain of Lotus Island.

172
01:17:31,209 --> 01:17:36,715
Some men join forces to assault banks
and steal money, pieces of paper.

173
01:17:37,591 --> 01:17:42,179
We must unite our forces to assault
the holy mountain,

174
01:17:42,304 --> 01:17:46,725
and rob its wise men
of their secret of immortality.

175
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,727
But to conquer the wisdom
of the Immortals,

176
01:17:48,852 --> 01:17:50,729
we too must become wise men.

177
01:17:51,897 --> 01:17:57,027
The elements of chemistry
are many, but finite.

178
01:17:57,152 --> 01:18:00,614
So are the techniques of enlightenment.

179
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:05,577
To reach it more quickly
we will combine the techniques.

180
01:18:05,702 --> 01:18:11,291
With the correct formula, any human
being can become enlightened.

181
01:18:13,752 --> 01:18:16,296
The Immortals are a group.

182
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:21,009
If we are to succeed,
we must cease to be individuals,

183
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:23,136
and become a collective being.

184
01:18:42,322 --> 01:18:44,282
Burn your money!

185
01:20:03,194 --> 01:20:08,074
Thief! If you don't want to die,
kill your money.

186
01:20:22,422 --> 01:20:25,675
We shall destroy the self-image,

187
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,804
unsteady, wavering, bewildered,

188
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:34,309
full of desire, distracted, confused.

189
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:40,648
When the self-concept thinks,
this is I and that is mine,

190
01:20:40,774 --> 01:20:45,362
he binds himself
and he forgets the great self.

191
01:23:06,711 --> 01:23:10,507
- His feet stink like a rotten dog.
- He has beautiful teeth.

192
01:23:10,632 --> 01:23:13,134
I can't stand the smell.

193
01:23:33,363 --> 01:23:38,076
When he puts all your bones back together,
you will like his smell.

194
01:23:48,253 --> 01:23:53,675
Man learned to cultivate the earth
by weakening the plants,

195
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:58,346
wild plants remained as they were
at the moment of creation.

196
01:23:58,471 --> 01:24:02,016
They are the humble
guardians of the secret.

197
01:24:54,736 --> 01:25:00,074
The flower knows...
you don't need to ask it.

198
01:26:35,294 --> 01:26:38,631
The dog will take your senses
away with him.

199
01:26:38,756 --> 01:26:41,467
He can see for you.

200
01:26:50,226 --> 01:26:55,440
The delicate scent of flowers
is the fragrance of the universe.

201
01:26:55,565 --> 01:27:00,194
I eat the flower,
and its perfume is my blood.

202
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:05,825
Together we form a dog,
in search of the sacred flower.

203
01:27:06,743 --> 01:27:11,581
Together we form a flower,
in search of the sacred water.

204
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:18,254
This is the moment
when the word is made flesh.

205
01:27:46,115 --> 01:27:48,576
How many people are you?

206
01:27:48,701 --> 01:27:50,328
One, two, three, four, five...

207
01:27:52,538 --> 01:27:53,998
We are nine.

208
01:27:54,123 --> 01:27:56,834
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

209
01:27:56,959 --> 01:28:00,546
- One is missing.
- Yes.

210
01:28:09,931 --> 01:28:12,642
Here is the missing one.
He drowned.

211
01:28:27,824 --> 01:28:29,408
He drowned.

212
01:29:14,704 --> 01:29:17,498
This is the ceremony of death.

213
01:29:17,623 --> 01:29:20,793
The grave receives you with love.

214
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:23,588
Surrender yourselves to death.

215
01:29:24,463 --> 01:29:28,050
Return what was loaned to you.

216
01:29:28,175 --> 01:29:31,637
Give up your pleasure, your pains.

217
01:29:31,762 --> 01:29:35,099
Give up your friends, your lovers.

218
01:29:35,224 --> 01:29:39,228
Give up your family, your past.

219
01:29:39,353 --> 01:29:43,983
Surrender what you hate,
what you desire.

220
01:29:44,108 --> 01:29:46,444
You will know nothingness -

221
01:29:46,569 --> 01:29:49,530
it is the only reality.

222
01:29:49,655 --> 01:29:53,576
Don't be afraid. It's so easy to give.

223
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:56,996
You are not alone. You have a grave.

224
01:29:57,121 --> 01:29:59,624
It is your first mother.

225
01:29:59,749 --> 01:30:02,960
The grave is the door to your rebirth.

226
01:30:03,711 --> 01:30:09,967
Now you will surrender the faithful animal
you once called your body.

227
01:30:10,092 --> 01:30:12,094
Don't try to keep it.

228
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:14,972
Remember, it was a loan.

229
01:30:16,015 --> 01:30:19,852
Surrender your legs, surrender your sex,

230
01:30:19,977 --> 01:30:25,524
your hair, your blood, your organs,
your bones.

231
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:27,944
You no longer want to possess.

232
01:30:28,069 --> 01:30:30,863
Possession is the ultimate pain.

233
01:30:30,988 --> 01:30:33,491
The earth falls over your corpse.

234
01:30:33,616 --> 01:30:36,160
She comes to cover you with love,

235
01:30:36,285 --> 01:30:38,537
because she is your true flesh.

236
01:30:39,705 --> 01:30:42,541
Now you are an empty heart,

237
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:46,379
open to receive your truest selves.

238
01:30:46,504 --> 01:30:50,341
Your own perfection, your new body,

239
01:30:50,466 --> 01:30:54,679
which is the universe, the work of God.

240
01:30:54,804 --> 01:30:58,224
You will be born again, you will be real,

241
01:30:58,349 --> 01:31:01,727
you will be your own father,
your own mother,

242
01:31:01,852 --> 01:31:05,356
your own child, your own perfection.

243
01:31:05,481 --> 01:31:09,151
Open your eyes. You are the earth,
you are the green,

244
01:31:09,276 --> 01:31:13,781
you are the blue, you are the Aleph,
you are the essence.

245
01:31:13,906 --> 01:31:17,702
Look at the flower.
Look at the flower.

246
01:31:17,827 --> 01:31:22,081
For the first time, look at the flowers.

247
01:31:22,206 --> 01:31:24,917
Now, you are a group.

248
01:32:19,847 --> 01:32:22,725
Do you want to perform
miracles like Christ?

249
01:32:23,726 --> 01:32:26,395
See what would happen if you did.

250
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:48,269
Concentrate on this starfish.

251
01:33:48,394 --> 01:33:53,149
When you see the size of an elephant,
you will never miss the target.

252
01:33:59,905 --> 01:34:02,283
Our thoughts have forms.

253
01:34:02,408 --> 01:34:05,619
You have a monster in your mind.

254
01:34:05,744 --> 01:34:07,913
We will help you.

255
01:35:00,341 --> 01:35:03,010
Throw the monster into the water.

256
01:35:22,738 --> 01:35:25,115
He can't swim, he will drown.

257
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:29,870
Fool, destroy your illusions.

258
01:35:30,955 --> 01:35:33,624
Free yourself from the past.

259
01:35:52,977 --> 01:35:54,937
We have crossed the great waters.

260
01:36:28,804 --> 01:36:32,599
Congratulations, you made it to our shores!
This deserves a toast!

261
01:36:32,725 --> 01:36:36,562
You're not the first to come to Lotus Island
in search of the holy mountain.

262
01:36:43,068 --> 01:36:47,072
I drink alone because newcomers
are always abstainers.

263
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:50,200
In time they realize
that the best liquor in the world

264
01:36:50,326 --> 01:36:52,328
is at the Pantheon Bar.

265
01:36:53,829 --> 01:36:57,082
Come. Come. Come.
I have everything -

266
01:36:57,207 --> 01:37:01,295
food, drinks, beds, baths,
men, women.

267
01:37:36,372 --> 01:37:40,167
These illustrious travelers
came here to find the holy mountain,

268
01:37:40,292 --> 01:37:43,587
but they preferred The Pantheon Bar!

269
01:37:47,257 --> 01:37:49,718
The real holy mountain is here -

270
01:37:49,843 --> 01:37:52,846
in my words, in my poems.

271
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:57,851
If I write rose, it blooms in my hand,

272
01:37:58,602 --> 01:38:02,314
And the bees come
to feed on my poetry.

273
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:10,364
Our bees make honey,
but your flies make shit.

274
01:38:17,287 --> 01:38:21,041
The cross was a mushroom.

275
01:38:22,751 --> 01:38:28,048
And the mushroom was also
the tree of good and evil.

276
01:38:29,174 --> 01:38:33,554
The philosophical stone
of the alchemists...

277
01:38:34,721 --> 01:38:38,392
...was LSD.

278
01:38:47,192 --> 01:38:50,362
The book of the dead is a trip,

279
01:38:51,488 --> 01:38:57,619
and the Apocalypse describes
a mescaline experience.

280
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,589
In these flasks...

281
01:39:10,466 --> 01:39:13,969
...are all the holy mountains.

282
01:39:15,304 --> 01:39:18,807
And in this beautiful young man...

283
01:39:19,725 --> 01:39:21,768
...is eternity.

284
01:39:25,606 --> 01:39:27,733
To conquer a mountain is easy.

285
01:39:27,858 --> 01:39:30,694
I can go through solid matter.

286
01:39:36,074 --> 01:39:39,328
Nothing stops me!

287
01:39:39,453 --> 01:39:43,081
In a minute I will cross the holy
mountain. Wait for me here!

288
01:39:45,834 --> 01:39:48,545
I got to the other side of the mountain
in less than a minute.

289
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:54,718
- How long until you reach the summit?
- No, I can only advance horizontally.

290
01:39:54,843 --> 01:39:56,637
That's enough.

291
01:39:56,762 --> 01:39:59,431
From bottom to top, I can't do.

292
01:39:59,556 --> 01:40:02,309
But anyway, I am a champion!

293
01:40:02,434 --> 01:40:05,187
I have conquered
the holy mountain horizontally!

294
01:40:05,312 --> 01:40:08,565
Horizontally! I am a champion!
I am a champion!

295
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:10,901
I founded the academy.
I give the awards!

296
01:40:11,026 --> 01:40:13,111
Here you can win a trophy every year.

297
01:40:13,654 --> 01:40:17,032
Idiots! You don't know
what you are losing!

298
01:40:17,157 --> 01:40:21,411
You could have made history
and we are already forgetting you!

299
01:41:00,409 --> 01:41:04,037
Help me! I can't go one step farther!

300
01:41:04,162 --> 01:41:08,041
You're not afraid of falling.
What frightens you is climbing.

301
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:11,962
- Rub your clitoris against the mountain.
- You're terrified of success.

302
01:41:12,087 --> 01:41:14,172
Give yourself to the world!

303
01:41:59,092 --> 01:42:01,136
I can't lie anymore.

304
01:42:03,013 --> 01:42:04,890
My hand is frozen.

305
01:42:06,475 --> 01:42:09,019
You were never able
to forget your body,

306
01:42:09,144 --> 01:42:11,980
never able to pry yourself
from that love.

307
01:42:12,105 --> 01:42:15,942
Now the thing you love most
is stopping you from reaching the top.

308
01:42:16,068 --> 01:42:18,779
You must sacrifice part of your body.

309
01:42:22,449 --> 01:42:25,410
Cut off your fingers, or go back!

310
01:42:54,439 --> 01:42:57,734
We have mastered
the difficult part of the mountain.

311
01:42:58,944 --> 01:43:01,947
Now the way will be like a garden.

312
01:43:02,072 --> 01:43:07,285
Nevertheless, at this height
our minds will decompose.

313
01:43:07,411 --> 01:43:10,330
And we will suffer the vision of death.

314
01:43:10,455 --> 01:43:14,543
- Lies!
- If you don't believe, wait for us here.

315
01:43:15,544 --> 01:43:19,715
When I return,
I will show you the difficult way.

316
01:47:36,304 --> 01:47:38,056
There are the Immortals!

317
01:47:40,850 --> 01:47:43,895
Meditate here for three hours
before you attack them.

318
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:45,230
And you?

319
01:47:47,899 --> 01:47:50,151
You don't need a master now.

320
01:47:51,236 --> 01:47:53,905
You can win by yourself.

321
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:56,116
Goodbye.

322
01:48:03,289 --> 01:48:06,626
This is the way we may reach
that summit.

323
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:09,337
Then we will master our bodies.

324
01:48:10,922 --> 01:48:13,049
You know now what you must do.

325
01:48:13,174 --> 01:48:16,553
You don't need anyone,
you are a master.

326
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:20,557
Cut off my head.

327
01:48:54,132 --> 01:48:56,551
Now you can begin to learn.

328
01:49:08,855 --> 01:49:11,983
Unite yourself with this good woman,

329
01:49:12,108 --> 01:49:15,653
who came here only
because she loves you.

330
01:49:19,908 --> 01:49:24,788
Forget the summits,
reach eternity through love.

331
01:49:24,913 --> 01:49:27,373
Return to your country.

332
01:49:27,499 --> 01:49:31,669
I leave you my tower
and my alchemical rooms.

333
01:49:31,795 --> 01:49:34,547
This is your family and your people.

334
01:49:34,672 --> 01:49:36,466
Change the world.

335
01:50:24,097 --> 01:50:25,974
Sit down.

336
01:50:36,734 --> 01:50:40,989
I promised you the great secret
and I will not disappoint you.

337
01:50:49,956 --> 01:50:52,750
Is this the end of our adventure?

338
01:50:52,876 --> 01:50:55,086
Nothing has an end.

339
01:50:56,045 --> 01:50:59,257
We came in search
of the secret of immortality.

340
01:50:59,382 --> 01:51:01,551
To be like gods.

341
01:51:01,676 --> 01:51:05,096
And here we are...mortals.

342
01:51:05,221 --> 01:51:07,849
More human than ever.

343
01:51:08,975 --> 01:51:12,228
If we have not obtained immortality,

344
01:51:12,353 --> 01:51:15,440
at least we have obtained reality.

345
01:51:15,565 --> 01:51:20,195
We began in a fairytale
and we came to life!

346
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,782
But is this life reality?

347
01:51:24,908 --> 01:51:26,492
No.

348
01:51:26,618 --> 01:51:28,661
It is a film.

349
01:51:28,786 --> 01:51:31,706
Zoom back camera.

350
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:44,177
We are images, dreams, photographs.

351
01:51:45,261 --> 01:51:47,847
We must not stay here!

352
01:51:47,972 --> 01:51:49,849
Prisoners!

353
01:51:49,974 --> 01:51:52,685
We shall break the illusion.

354
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:55,355
This is Maya.

355
01:52:03,404 --> 01:52:06,115
Goodbye to the holy mountain.

356
01:52:06,241 --> 01:52:09,285
Real life awaits us.
