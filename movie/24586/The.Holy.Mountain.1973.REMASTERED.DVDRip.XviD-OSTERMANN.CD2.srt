0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,134
Berg, why do we have
that enormous hole in the wall?

1
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:07,234
Close it up!

2
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:42,569
Our little baby is hungry.

3
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,846
- Have you finished the report?
- No.

4
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:18,539
The president wants the report.
Hurry up! Hurry!

5
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:39,895
I am financial adviser to the president.

6
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:03,546
To save the country's economy,

7
00:03:03,654 --> 00:03:08,648
we must eliminate four million citizens
in the next five years.

8
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:17,065
Begin the operations
of the gas chambers.

9
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:21,798
Gas schools, gas universities,
gas libraries, gas museums,

10
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:25,069
gas dance halls,
and gas whore houses, etcetera.

11
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:33,468
I hate you! I hate you!

12
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:42,143
My name is Axon, my planet is Neptune.

13
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:44,653
I am the chief of police.

14
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:54,858
This is the most beautiful day
of your life.

15
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,090
Of your own free will you came
to surrender part of your body to me.

16
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:03,132
You decided to undergo the initiation

17
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:08,934
that 999
other heroes have passed.

18
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:24,617
Your sacrifice completes my
sanctuary of one thousand testicles.

19
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:43,006
This is the holy book.
Learn to believe in me.

20
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:11,148
Axon is the truth and the power
and the light...

21
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:21,922
My name is Lut, my planet is Pluto.

22
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:24,364
My business is architecture.

23
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:38,545
Where is he?

24
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,016
He's there, he's there!

25
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,950
No, no he's not!

26
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,631
He's up there. There he is!
He's up there!

27
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:05,842
Go get him!
Come on, let's go get him!

28
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:09,237
Where is he?

29
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:16,683
There he is!

30
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:28,161
When we built this multi-family complex
we made a big mistake -

31
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:30,426
we lost money.

32
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,934
We gave them small gardens
and windows, we installed water,

33
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,973
lighting, and heating systems.

34
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:39,565
This was a wrong concept.

35
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,840
A man doesn't need a home,
all he needs is a shelter.

36
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:49,215
If we can sell him on the idea
of a shelter, we can make millions.

37
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:15,571
A worker will come here only to sleep,
he won't need electricity or water.

38
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,412
He won't have to cook,
we'll condition him to eat at the factory.

39
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:25,720
These are communal latrine trucks
for the entire building.

40
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:12,145
You have power and money,
but you are mortal.

41
00:14:12,256 --> 00:14:15,089
You know you cannot escape death.

42
00:14:15,192 --> 00:14:18,025
But immortality can be obtained.

43
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:27,235
In old traditions they speak
of holy mountains.

44
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:30,437
The Meru mountain of India.

45
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:35,971
Mount Kunlun of the Taoists.

46
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,572
The Karakoram of the Himalaya.

47
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:43,110
The mountain of the philosophers.

48
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:46,318
The Rosicrucian mountain.

49
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:49,586
The Cabalistic mountain
of San Juan De La Cruz.

50
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:52,890
There are many other holy mountains.

51
00:14:52,996 --> 00:14:55,897
The legend is always the same.

52
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,992
Nine lmmortal men live on top
of the mountain.

53
00:15:00,103 --> 00:15:03,072
From the highest peak
they direct our world.

54
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:07,803
They hold the secret
to the conquest of death.

55
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:12,143
They are more
than 40,000 years old.

56
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:15,047
But they were once like ourselves.

57
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:18,383
If others have succeeded
in conquering death,

58
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,185
why must we accept it?

59
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:26,285
I know where the lmmortals live
and how to obtain their secret.

60
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:34,227
In this ancient Rosicrucian manuscript,

61
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:39,469
I found an etching of the Nine lmmortals
and the place where they live.

62
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:42,602
The holy mountain of Lotus Island.

63
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:48,208
Some men join forces to assault banks
and steal money, pieces of paper.

64
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:54,223
We must unite our forces to assault
the holy mountain,

65
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:58,226
and rob its wise men
of their secret of immortality.

66
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:00,990
But to conquer the wisdom
of the lmmortals,

67
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,328
we too must become wise men.

68
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:08,496
The elements of chemistry
are many, but finite.

69
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:12,132
So are the techniques of enlightenment.

70
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:17,043
To reach it more quickly
we will combine the techniques.

71
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:22,813
With the correct formula, any human
being can become enlightened.

72
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,784
The lmmortals are a group.

73
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:32,487
If we are to succeed,
we must cease to be individuals,

74
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:34,655
and become a collective being.

75
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,784
Burn your money!

76
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:19,568
Thief! If you don't want to die,
kill your money.

77
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:37,182
We shall destroy the self image,

78
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:41,314
unsteady, wavering, bewildered,

79
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:45,862
full of desire, distracted, confused.

80
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:51,992
When the self concept thinks,
this is I and that is mine,

81
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:56,869
he binds himself
and he forgets the great self.

82
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:22,049
- His feet stink like a rotten dog.
- He has beautiful teeth.

83
00:21:22,152 --> 00:21:24,643
I can't stand the smell.

84
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:49,574
When he puts all your bones back
together, you will like his smell.

85
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:05,127
Man learned to cultivate the earth
by weakening the plants,

86
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:09,961
wild plants remained as they were
at the moment of creation.

87
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:13,524
They are the humble
guardians of the secret.

88
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:11,625
The flower knows...
you don't need to ask it.

89
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,624
The dog will take your senses
away with him.

90
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:53,025
He can see for you.

91
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:06,940
The delicate scent of flowers
is the fragrance of the universe.

92
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:11,707
I eat the flower,
and its perfume is my blood.

93
00:25:11,815 --> 00:25:17,720
Together we form a dog,
in search of the sacred flower.

94
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:24,784
Together we form a flower,
in search of the sacred water.

95
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:30,388
This is the moment
when the word is made flesh.

96
00:25:57,994 --> 00:26:00,554
How many people are you?

97
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:02,893
One, two, three, four, five...

98
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:05,857
We are nine.

99
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:08,802
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

100
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:12,136
- One is missing.
- Yes.

101
00:26:21,851 --> 00:26:24,319
Here is the missing one.
He drowned.

102
00:26:39,302 --> 00:26:40,963
He drowned.

103
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:29,141
This is the ceremony of death.

104
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:32,415
The grave receives you with love.

105
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:35,150
Surrender yourselves to death.

106
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,620
Return what was loaned to you.

107
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:43,221
Give up your pleasure, your pains.

108
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,700
Give up your friends, your lovers.

109
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:50,864
Give up your family, your past.

110
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:55,502
Surrender what you hate,
what you desire.

111
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:58,103
You will know nothingness -

112
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:01,047
it is the only reality.

113
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,086
Don't be afraid. It's so easy to give.

114
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:08,521
You are not alone. You have a grave.

115
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,093
It is your first mother.

116
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:14,527
The grave is the door to your rebirth.

117
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:21,601
Now you will surrender the faithful animal
you once called your body.

118
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:23,695
Don't try to keep it.

119
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:27,606
Remember, it was a loan.

120
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,146
Surrender your legs, surrender your sex,

121
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:37,049
your hair, your blood, your organs,
your bones.

122
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:39,348
You no longer want to possess.

123
00:28:39,455 --> 00:28:42,185
Possession is the ultimate pain.

124
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:45,125
The earth falls over your corpse.

125
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:47,753
She comes to cover you with love,

126
00:28:47,864 --> 00:28:51,129
because she is your true flesh.

127
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:54,101
Now you are an empty heart,

128
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:57,900
open to receive your truest selves.

129
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:01,909
Your own perfection, your new body,

130
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:06,209
which is the universe, the work of God.

131
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:09,752
You will be born again, you will be real,

132
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:13,253
you will be your own father,
your own mother,

133
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:16,848
your own child, your own perfection.

134
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,622
Open your eyes. You are the earth,
you are the green,

135
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,292
you are the blue, you are the Aleph,
you are the essence.

136
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:29,167
Look at the flower.
Look at the flower.

137
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:33,538
For the first time, look at the flowers.

138
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:36,476
Now, you are a group.

139
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:35,235
Do you want to perform
miracles like Christ?

140
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:38,102
See what would happen if you did.

141
00:31:57,386 --> 00:31:59,854
Concentrate on this starfish.

142
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:05,792
When you see the size of an elephant,
you will never miss the target.

143
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,891
Our thoughts have forms.

144
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:17,234
You have a monster in your mind.

145
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,433
We will help you.

146
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:14,523
Throw the monster into the water.

147
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:36,684
He can't swim, he will drown.

148
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,387
Fool, destroy your illusions.

149
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:45,256
Free yourself from the past.

150
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,416
We have crossed the great waters.

151
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:44,182
Congratulations, you made it to our
shores! This deserves a toast!

152
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:48,120
You're not the first to come to Lotus
Island in search of the holy mountain.

153
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:58,533
I drink alone because newcomers
are always abstainers.

154
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,762
In time they realize
that the best liquor in the world

155
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:03,736
is at the Pantheon Bar.

156
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:08,671
Come. Come. Come.
I have everything -

157
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:12,805
food, drinks, beds, baths,
men, women.

158
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:51,683
These illustrious travelers
came here to find the holy mountain,

159
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:55,086
but they preferred The Pantheon Bar!

160
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:01,321
The real holy mountain is here -

161
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,399
in my words, in my poems.

162
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:09,399
If I write rose, it blooms in my hand,

163
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:13,836
And the bees come
to feed on my poetry.

164
00:36:18,514 --> 00:36:21,972
Our bees make honey,
but your flies make shit.

165
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:32,557
The cross was a mushroom.

166
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,561
And the mushroom was also
the tree of good and evil.

167
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:45,366
The philosophical stone
of the alchemists...

168
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:49,937
...was LSD.

169
00:36:58,854 --> 00:37:03,188
The book of the dead is a trip,

170
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:09,424
and the Apocalypse
describes a mescaline experience.

171
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,067
In these flasks...

172
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:25,502
...are all the holy mountains.

173
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:30,343
And in this beautiful young man...

174
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,311
...is eternity.

175
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,252
To conquer a mountain is easy.

176
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:42,228
I can go through solid matter.

177
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:51,037
Nothing stops me!

178
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,940
In a minute I will cross the holy
mountain. Wait for me here!

179
00:37:57,313 --> 00:38:00,248
I got to the other side of the mountain
in less than a minute.

180
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:06,254
- How long until you reach the summit?
- No, I can only advance horizontally.

181
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:08,186
That's enough.

182
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,054
From bottom to top, I can't do.

183
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,822
But anyway, I am a champion!

184
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:16,762
I have conquered
the holy mountain horizontally!

185
00:38:16,866 --> 00:38:20,267
Horizontally! I am a champion!
I am a champion!

186
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:22,599
I founded the academy.
I give the awards!

187
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:24,673
Here you can win a trophy every year.

188
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:28,675
Idiots! You don't know
what you are losing!

189
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:32,804
You could have made history
and we are already forgetting you!

190
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:15,550
Help me! I can't go one step farther!

191
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:19,560
You're not afraid of falling.
What frightens you is climbing.

192
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:23,462
- Rub your clitoris against the mountain.
- You're terrified of success.

193
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:25,726
Give yourself to the world!

194
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:16,040
I can't lie anymore. My hand is frozen.

195
00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:20,715
You were never able to forget
your body,

196
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:23,621
never able to pry yourself
from that love.

197
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:27,526
Now the thing you love most
is stopping you from reaching the top.

198
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,291
You must sacrifice part of your body.

199
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:36,938
Cut off your fingers, or go back!

200
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:09,233
We have mastered
the difficult part of the mountain.

201
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:13,800
Now the way will be like a garden.

202
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:19,074
Nevertheless, at this height
our minds will decompose.

203
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:21,843
And we will suffer the vision of death.

204
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,910
- Lies!
- If you don't believe, wait for us here.

205
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:31,322
When I return,
I will show you the difficult way.

206
00:45:48,116 --> 00:45:50,414
There are the lmmortals!

207
00:45:52,487 --> 00:45:55,422
Meditate here for three hours
before you attack them.

208
00:45:55,524 --> 00:45:57,788
And you?

209
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:02,825
You don't need a master now.

210
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:07,664
You can win by yourself. Goodbye.

211
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,411
This is the way we may reach
that summit.

212
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:20,845
Then we will master our bodies.

213
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:24,845
You know now what you must do.

214
00:46:24,953 --> 00:46:28,889
You don't need anyone,
you are a master.

215
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:32,083
Cut off my head.

216
00:47:05,827 --> 00:47:08,387
Now you can begin to learn.

217
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:23,605
Unite yourself with this good woman,

218
00:47:23,712 --> 00:47:27,170
who came here only
because she loves you.

219
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,514
Forget the summits,
reach eternity through love.

220
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,025
Return to your country.

221
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:43,427
I leave you my tower
and my alchemical rooms.

222
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:46,092
This is your family and your people.

223
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:48,032
Change the world.

224
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:37,515
Sit down.

225
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,530
I promised you the great secret
and I will not disappoint you.

226
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:04,409
Is this the end of our adventure?

227
00:49:04,513 --> 00:49:06,606
Nothing has an end.

228
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:11,074
We came in search
of the secret of immortality.

229
00:49:11,186 --> 00:49:13,518
To be like gods.

230
00:49:13,622 --> 00:49:16,955
And here we are... mortals.

231
00:49:17,058 --> 00:49:19,526
More human than ever.

232
00:49:20,629 --> 00:49:23,826
If we have not obtained immortality,

233
00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:27,197
at least we have obtained reality.

234
00:49:27,302 --> 00:49:31,966
We began in a fairytale
and we came to life!

235
00:49:32,073 --> 00:49:36,373
But is this life reality?

236
00:49:36,478 --> 00:49:38,139
No.

237
00:49:38,246 --> 00:49:43,183
It is a film. Zoom back camera.

238
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:55,694
We are images, dreams, photographs.

239
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:59,528
We must not stay here!

240
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:01,465
Prisoners!

241
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,471
We shall break the illusion.

242
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:07,064
This is Maya.

243
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:17,813
Goodbye to the holy mountain.

244
00:50:17,919 --> 00:50:20,786
Real life awaits us.

245
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:42,660
