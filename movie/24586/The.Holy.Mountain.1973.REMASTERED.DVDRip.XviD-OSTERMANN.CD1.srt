0
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,296
Watch the birdie!

1
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,782
Come on, have something to drink
with us. Come on, drink with us.

2
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,548
Drink it, drink it...

3
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,128
Do you want gold?

4
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,696
Yes.

5
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:48,914
You are excrement.
You can change yourself into gold.

6
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:32,488
You broke the looking glass.
Now break the stone.

7
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,646
Each stone has a soul,

8
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,851
formed by the work of millions of years.

9
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,397
The tarot will teach you
how to create a soul.

10
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,035
To know.

11
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,956
To dare.

12
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,839
To want.

13
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,811
To be silent.

14
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:48,017
The same force the vulture
uses to seize the ox

15
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:52,118
is needed by the ox
to receive the vulture.

16
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:39,542
The fish thinks about his hunger,
not about the fisherman.

17
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,007
It is the master
who seeks the disciple.

18
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,212
You want to know the secret,

19
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,724
but man can achieve nothing
by himself.

20
00:39:55,826 --> 00:40:00,092
To accomplish the alchemical work,
you will have these companions.

21
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,564
They are thieves like you,
but on another level.

22
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,932
They are the most powerful people
on the planet.

23
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:10,768
Industrialists and politicians.

24
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:15,710
My name is Fon, my planet is Venus.

25
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:21,480
My business is devoted to the comfort
and beauty of the human body -

26
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:26,318
beds, mattresses, fabrics,

27
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,484
clothing, cosmetics.

28
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,373
My father is the creator of this empire.

29
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:52,779
He is deaf, dumb and blind.

30
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:58,283
Before making a decision,
he consults with my mother's mummy.

31
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,619
He puts his hand into her sex.

32
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:05,252
If it's moist, it's yes.
If it's dry, it's no.

33
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,232
These are my wives.

34
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,362
I make love to them
only during working hours.

35
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:20,274
They begin as workers,
then I promote them to secretaries.

36
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,424
We know that people want to be loved,

37
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:27,698
not for who they are
but for what they appear to be.

38
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,638
So we have created a line of masks,

39
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:35,235
that have the texture,
warmth, and smell,

40
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:38,440
of living human beings.

41
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:42,542
A customer can have any face
she wants.

42
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:47,090
Every face is unique
and lasts a lifetime.

43
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:50,490
She can wear her artificial face
to the grave.

44
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,690
Our make-up department for corpses
eliminates the appearance of death.

45
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,790
Not only do we beautify cadavers,

46
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:01,428
we also equip them
with electronic devices.

47
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,371
They can kiss their family goodbye...

48
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:14,215
...participate in their own last rites...

49
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,855
...or give a live show.

50
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,973
My name is Isla, my planet is Mars.

51
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,435
Every morning I wake up
my male secretaries.

52
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,784
I manufacture and sell weapons.

53
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,388
We produce bombers,
hydrogen bombs,

54
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,659
ray guns, deadly bacteria,

55
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:48,932
anti-matter waves,
carcinogenic gases, etcetera.

56
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:05,845
We are experimenting with a drug
to create delusions of grandeur.

57
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:11,324
Another drug turns harmless people
into wild beasts.

58
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,710
The young generation needs arms
for its marches and sit-ins.

59
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,691
We have psychedelic shotguns...

60
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,366
...grenade necklaces...

61
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,665
...rock and roll weapons...

62
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,163
...mystical weapons for Buddhists...

63
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,407
...Jews...

64
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,112
...and Christians.

65
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:12,378
My name is Klen,
my planet is Jupiter.

66
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,480
My house.

67
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,488
My wife.

68
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,408
My chauffer.

69
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,234
- My lover.
- Hi!

70
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,330
A thousand a week.

71
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,222
My art factory.

72
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:45,096
We produce a new line of art
every season.

73
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,469
We created a love machine.

74
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:54,032
To make it live the spectator
has to work with it, guide it,

75
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,636
receive it,
give himself in the act of love.

76
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:02,514
With this electronic rod
he will rub its mechanical vagina.

77
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:07,716
The spectator's skill will determine
the machine's ability to reach a climax.

78
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,722
My chauffer is a bad lover.

79
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,850
He didn't know how to satisfy it.

80
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,191
But this woman,
I know her techniques very well,

81
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,527
will produce the electronic orgasm.

82
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,464
Frigid!

83
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,143
My name is Sel, my planet is Saturn.

84
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,112
My customers are children.

85
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,840
We manufacture war toys.

86
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:23,599
Workers needed in the miniature
plastic bomb shop.

87
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,484
We have an electronic computer

88
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:45,425
programmed with the politics
of the government.

89
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,621
The government is our client.

90
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:58,673
We feed the computer data
on coming wars and revolutions.

91
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,903
It tells us what kind of toys to produce

92
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,445
to condition children from birth.

93
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:13,255
If the government calculates it will be
necessary to wage war against Peru,

94
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:16,587
our machine studies the Peruvians
and tells us what to do.

95
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:24,826
We manufacture hyper-sexed
brown native vampires,

96
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,700
who can only be destroyed
by a cross the color of white skin.

97
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:32,104
We create a laxative
that induces vomiting.

98
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:36,941
We name it after the capital of Peru
and tint it with the color of the natives.

99
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,345
We started a comic book campaign.

100
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,237
For 15 years in advance,

101
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:11,177
we condition children
to hate the future enemy.

102
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,421
In 15 years these children
will go off to war,

103
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,754
to kill Peruvians with pleasure.

104
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:04,625
My name is Berg,
my planet is Uranus.

105
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,155
Our window is the wrong size,

106
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,088
I don't like it.

107
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,122
Berg, why do we have
that enormous hole in the wall?
