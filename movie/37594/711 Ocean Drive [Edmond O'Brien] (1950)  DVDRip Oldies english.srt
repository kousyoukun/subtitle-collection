1
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:51,882
GANGSTER SQUAD

2
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:01,556
We'll be at the airport
in about twenty minutes.

3
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,898
That'll put us in Las Vegas about 2:30.

4
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:06,354
We're going after Granger,
aren't we, lieutenant?

5
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:07,428
That's right.

6
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:08,918
What's the charge?

7
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:10,334
Murder.

8
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
What happens to a guy
like Granger?

9
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:15,344
I don't know.

10
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,059
Too much ambition maybe.

11
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:19,195
Too many brains working
in the wrong direction.

12
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:21,183
Or maybe it's glandular.

13
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,249
Step on it. We're late.

14
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,092
<i>Carter wanted to talk.

15
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:30,038
<i>But what could I tell him
about the real Mal Granger?

16
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:32,193
<i>And I knew him better than most.

17
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,311
<i>He was in the racing wire
service racket.

18
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:37,047
<i>But he started out
just like anybody else.

19
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:38,716
<i>He wasn't a criminal.

20
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:41,692
<i>He was just a guy working
for the telephone company.

21
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:47,094
I just wish I could lay my hands on
Don Ameche for a while.

22
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:48,744
I'd teach him to invent the telephone.

23
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,722
I've always had a secret desire
to cross up some of these wires.

24
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,511
Get all the wrong people
talking to each other.

25
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:58,364
Might be interesting at that.

26
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,724
Oh, lady, lady.

27
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,439
What are you so quiet about?

28
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:04,819
Bessie's sick again.

29
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:07,532
Every time we get almost caught up,
one of the kids gets sick.

30
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:08,352
Kaplooey.

31
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,376
I don't see how you do it.

32
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,415
Take care of a wife and a couple of kids
on our dough.

33
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,682
I can't even handle myself
on that chicken feed.

34
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:14,532
It's tough, Mal.

35
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:16,788
If it wasn't for a couple of bets
now and then, I'd never make it.

36
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:17,994
Here.

37
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,564
There's twenty bucks that's not working.

38
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:22,144
No thanks, Mal. If I need it at the end
of the week, I'll let you know.

39
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,519
By the end of the week I may not
have it. You better take it now.

40
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,520
Gee, thanks, Mal.

41
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:26,939
Tessie's gonna love you for this.

42
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,821
Yeah? My bookie's gonna hate me.

43
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,480
See you at lunch.
-Right.

44
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,885
Forget about those daily doubles, bud.

45
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:35,914
Thanks.

46
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,463
Say, how about mine?
-Hello, Bill.

47
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,031
Six forty and twelve thirty.
Eighteen seventy I owe you.

48
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:42,109
Well, finally.

49
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:43,651
Stick with me, kid, you get nothing
but winners.

50
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,001
Ah, that was yesterday.

51
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:47,808
Hi Jack.
-Hi Chippie. 22.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,722
Ought to start breaking for you soon.
A guy can't play tough luck all the time

53
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,631
I'll believe it when you
begin to pay off.

54
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,667
It'll be a pleasure. Here.

55
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,322
Scratch sheet on the house.

56
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,341
Something in there might really pay off.

57
00:03:58,357 --> 00:03:59,793
Hi Chippie.
-Hi Mal.

58
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:01,388
How's the banking business?
-Fine.

59
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:04,514
All right, how much do I owe you?
And slug me gently, will you?

60
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:05,467
Forty even.

61
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,105
You ought to start playing
some chalk horses.

62
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,656
Too many of those long shots run out.

63
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:10,692
I don't get any bang out of those
even money payoffs.

64
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,634
For me, it's boxcars or nothing.

65
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,142
'Course this week it's nothing.

66
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:16,177
But, if you can carry me
till Saturday, little man.

67
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,201
Sure, Mal, anytime.

68
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,251
You know me, Chippie.

69
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,254
I don't see why a guy like you
should always be broke.

70
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,754
Why, if I had your...

71
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,076
Hey.

72
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,847
How about having a cup of coffee
with me?

73
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:33,630
Well, you're buying I hope.

74
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,773
Sure.
-All right.

75
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,912
Two coffees.

76
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:38,972
Right.

77
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,467
Say uh...

78
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,282
You wouldn't want to carry me
for another five, would you?

79
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,114
I like Big Day in the sixth at Aubrey.

80
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,223
Big Day?
-Yeah.

81
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:47,483
10 to 1, huh?
-Yeah.

82
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:49,619
It ain't the money, Mal, it's just that
he don't look so good.

83
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,953
All I can lose is five bucks
and if it wins, I break even.

84
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,758
How about it, Chippie?

85
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,226
Five straight on Big Day.

86
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,584
You know the only good thing
about putting bets on these?

87
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,328
I don't get indigestion swallowing them
every time a cop walks in.

88
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,434
You know, kid, if I were you,
I'd lay off the races.

89
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,911
That's the sucker's end of the racket.

90
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,411
All right, so maybe I'm losing
a customer.

91
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:09,842
But you're the kind of guy that's always
on the prowl for a fast buck.

92
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,156
And you're not going to make it
off the ponies.

93
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,178
How do you know? I might hit a streak.
Other guys have.

94
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:14,837
You're still taking the odds, Mal.

95
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,604
You ought to be able to turn a buck on
the side if you really need money.

96
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:18,968
Lend me a nickel, will you?

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,568
Here you are working for peanuts.

98
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,775
When you got something up there
that's worth a million bucks.

99
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:23,842
Yeah?

100
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,945
Anytime you figure a way I can
put it in the bank, I'll believe it.

101
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,854
You could be rolling in dough.

102
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:31,778
You got a know-how with
telephones and electronics

103
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:33,403
that's worth plenty to the right guy.

104
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,264
Dames, clothes, automobiles,

105
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,550
You could have anything you want, kid,
if you knew the right guy.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,910
You said that before.

107
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,348
I know the right guy, Mal.

108
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,431
He needs help.

109
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:44,481
So why shouldn't you be the guy
that makes the buck?

110
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,893
His name is Vince Wallace.
He runs the Tri-State Press.

111
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,049
I'll give you a run down on him
in a minute.

112
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,797
I want to get your bet in
before post time.

113
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,461
Hello, Moe?

114
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,671
Chippie.

115
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,721
What's the last post
for the sixth at Aubrey?

116
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,599
4:20?

117
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,580
Five to win on Big Day for Mal G.

118
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:15,220
Yeah, that's all.

119
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:24,451
Well, now that I owe you another fin,
I guess I have to listen to you.

120
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:27,068
All right, what is it that I've got that
this Wallace can't leave alone?

121
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,110
This Tri-State is a wire service.

122
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
It furnishes bookmakers with
all the dope for every race.

123
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,239
Direct from the track.

124
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:34,576
Would you like to see how
the other half lives?

125
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,953
Yeah.

126
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,729
Hey.

127
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:56,951
Are they kidding?

128
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,306
BE FREE
OF WORRY

129
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,453
Hello, Jake.
-Hi.

130
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:06,503
Got a man for the golden furnace.
-OK.

131
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,829
I tell you the wire broke down.

132
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,879
Can I help it if we were late
with the prices?

133
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:49,894
Nothing but beefs.

134
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:53,386
Half the time they're so drunk
you don't know what race is going.

135
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,523
What can I do for you, Chippie?
-Nothing.

136
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:56,934
We're gonna do something for you.

137
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,280
This is Mal Granger, Vince Wallace.
-How are you?

138
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,178
Mal's with the telephone company.

139
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,376
He's smart and knows electronics.

140
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:05,369
Telephone company, huh?
-Yeah.

141
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,105
I'm glad to know you Granger.

142
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:09,248
Can I buy you a drink?
-No thanks. I don't drink in the daytime

143
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,586
I get into enough trouble without it.

144
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:11,567
Don't let him kid you.

145
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:13,737
Aside from liking the ponies,
Mal's a steady citizen.

146
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:15,486
I'm glad you came, Granger.

147
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,800
Ever seen a layout like this before?
-No.

148
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,140
I'll show you around.

149
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:23,946
A bookmaker can't exist
without race results.

150
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,898
Right now the only wire service in town
is my outfit.

151
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:28,954
You see that telegraph key?

152
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,104
That's the backbone of the whole racket.

153
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:34,593
You see, my wire service is legitimate.

154
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:37,680
There's no law against selling
this information to anybody.

155
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
Those guys are talking to
bookmakers right now.

156
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,574
That's live dope.

157
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,208
We charge them plenty.

158
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:45,312
They get a running description
of everything

159
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:47,043
that's taking place at all the tracks.

160
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,770
The last odds, jockey changes,
scratches, post and off time,

161
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,364
the actual running of the race
and the results.

162
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:56,414
All with split second timing.

163
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,704
Of course, some of the tracks
don't help us any but...

164
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,747
We've got ways of getting
the information out

165
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:02,743
whether they like it or not.

166
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:03,547
I get it.

167
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:06,887
But if it was my outfit, I wouldn't want
to rely on a one lung setup like this.

168
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,254
Too many things can go wrong.

169
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,538
You're telling me.

170
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:10,992
Come on back to the office a minute.

171
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,555
Close the door, Chippie.

172
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
What I want to do is expand.

173
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,183
That's where the real gravy lies.

174
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,113
Let me show you something.

175
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,889
Right now, there isn't a bigger outfit
in the whole state.

176
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,796
So, the first guy that comes along
and gives bang up results

177
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:23,915
is gonna make a hat full.

178
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:26,415
There are hundreds of bookmakers
in every one of these towns.

179
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:29,295
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland,

180
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:32,364
Sacramento, Stockton, Fresno, San Diego.

181
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,741
Are you really hep to electronics?

182
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,188
I know what I'm doing.

183
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:39,061
What I need is a way to
distribute my information

184
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:40,857
 all over the state at the same time.

185
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:42,491
It would cost you dough
but you could do it.

186
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,095
Did you ever hear of relay amplifiers?

187
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,118
Relay amplifier?

188
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:47,570
Yeah, that's a new gadget that was
developed so people in different cities

189
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,867
could listen in to a telephone
conference at the same time.

190
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:52,143
Could you set one up for me so it would
work right out of L.A.?

191
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,126
Oh, sure.

192
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,261
You could run wires right out of this
basement to any city you wanted.

193
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:58,338
Then the bookies in the other cities
could get the results

194
00:09:58,377 --> 00:09:59,953
just like the guys
in the next room here.

195
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:00,703
Good.

196
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:03,318
I'd get rid of that telegrapher and
set up a teletype system.

197
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,909
Then you have a guy at a microphone
broadcast the results

198
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:08,260
just like a regular news broadcast
from a radio station.

199
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,387
Get the equipment and
set it up for me like that

200
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:12,517
and it's worth $125 a week to you.

201
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,567
Just as technical man
to keep it running.

202
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:18,932
I'll make it a hundred and fifty.

203
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:20,191
Is it a deal?

204
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,413
I always knew there was some way
to beat the races.

205
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:23,950
That'll do for now.
-Good.

206
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,564
One of you guys better count
your fingers. Hello, Chippie.

207
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:28,594
Sorry to be late, Vince. There was
a little trouble at the bank.

208
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:29,901
They didn't like some of those checks.

209
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,010
More bum checks, huh?

210
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,740
Mal Granger, Trudy Maxwell.

211
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,743
How are you?
-Hi.

212
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,574
He's going to put in
a few improvements around here.

213
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,851
You mean like fresh air?
I'm beginning to feel like a termite

214
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,434
working out of this basement
all the time.

215
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,148
Yeah, you could stand
a little air conditioning.

216
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,525
When I have time, you might give me
your ideas on the subject.

217
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:45,224
You've got a new approach.

218
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,306
First guy I ever met that made
air conditioning sound like etchings.

219
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:49,632
I've got things to do, Mal

220
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,766
You'll start work tomorrow, huh?
The faster, the better.

221
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,816
You can say that again.
Nice to have met you, Vince.

222
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,709
It was my pleasure.

223
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:57,774
Goodbye.
-So long.

224
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:25,904
That was a good dinner, wasn't it?

225
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,545
The steaks are delicious.

226
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:29,233
To think a few hours ago
I was a wage slave.

227
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:30,858
You ought to get rid of that.
-Uh-uh.

228
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:33,325
I still can't figure out why you
quit the phone company.

229
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,577
Honey, I got to thinking.
Are telephones here to stay?

230
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:38,292
Sure, they're here to stay.
You were doing fine with the company.

231
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,860
I was already beginning
to make a few plans.

232
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:43,106
Yeah? What kind of plans?

233
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,406
You know. I thought maybe
after your next raise...

234
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,306
Honey, there's nothing wrong
with your plans.

235
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:49,582
You just got the wrong guy.
-What do you mean?

236
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:52,340
You just hang on to your plans, baby,
but let go of me.

237
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,390
How are your plans...for tonight?

238
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:05,555
Hey.

239
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,181
What are they doing here?

240
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:08,728
Excuse us.

241
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,043
This is another one of Vince's angles.

242
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:17,362
He runs a check cashing service
for bookmakers.

243
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,921
He's sharp, all right.

244
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:21,697
I'm telling you right now,
I won't discount any more 

245
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:22,788
checks at the old rate.

246
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:25,295
If you want to duck income tax,
you get eighty cents on a buck

247
00:12:25,322 --> 00:12:26,640
for every stiff and no more.

248
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:27,400
It's not that, Vince.

249
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:29,647
He can't keep up the payments
on the 3,000 you advanced him.

250
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,012
It ain't my fault, Mr. Walters.

251
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:33,834
I only borrowed that dough because I
went overboard. I couldn't pay off.

252
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:36,055
So what? I want my dough
and the interest.

253
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,879
If you can't keep up your payments,
I'll cut you off the service.

254
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,655
If you do that, I'm out of business.

255
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,916
I gotta have that service, Mr. Walters.

256
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:44,966
If you could only give me a little time.

257
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,003
I'll give you one week.

258
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:50,313
Thanks, Mr. Walters, thanks. I'll...
-Get out.

259
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:56,537
For ten percent interest,
you have to expect a little trouble.

260
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,732
We got 3,600 in stiffs yesterday.

261
00:12:58,782 --> 00:13:02,416
Yes, but you can't make any dough
playing handball with rubber checks.

262
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,587
I want to see a girl about a boy.

263
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:18,124
I was feeling a little corny just now
and couldn't resist coming over

264
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,174
to tell you what a small world
I think it is.

265
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:22,494
Oh yes, you're new little boy we hired

266
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,522
to string wires up around the place.
-That's right.

267
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:27,478
I'm also very good at filling in
when people's dates don't show up.

268
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:28,664
Mine always do.

269
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:32,076
I'm sure they do. But I thought maybe
you had a daughter around my age.

270
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:33,496
What do you want?

271
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,833
We're getting up a game
of hopscotch tonight and

272
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,186
could you play on my side?

273
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,915
You're wasting your breath, Granger.

274
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:41,202
Trudy's all business.
Believe me, I know.

275
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:43,222
You sound like an adding machine.
Hello, Mr. Walters.

276
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:45,507
I only dropped over
because I had an idea.

277
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,626
Chippie tells me that Trudy
works the races for you.

278
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,086
And I thought maybe I ought to go
out there with her and uh...

279
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,413
See just what the setup is.

280
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:52,888
You can do that later.

281
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,782
For the first few weeks you're
gonna have enough to do

282
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:56,149
wiring up that new system.

283
00:13:57,155 --> 00:13:59,857
Well, I'm uh...I'm glad
we had this little talk.

284
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:06,630
SHAKE-UP ON L.A. POLICE FORCE
NEW GANGSTER SQUAD FORMED

285
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:10,677
How are you, lieutenant?

286
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:11,905
Hello, Wright.

287
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,477
Thanks for requesting me for your squad.

288
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:15,524
Sit down.

289
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,465
Where do I start?

290
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:19,677
You have a reputation of being a guy
nobody can approach.

291
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,670
That's why I asked for you when
they gave me the gangster squad.

292
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,719
You can start by checking up
on the bookie racket.

293
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,427
They've been having things
their own way too long.

294
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:32,532
There's one outfit in particular.

295
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:35,394
They call themselves the
Libertt Finance Company.

296
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:38,688
That's all we have on them so far.

297
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,282
<i>There was enough there to convince me

298
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:44,147
<i>that the Libertt Finance Co.
was the front

299
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:47,412
<i>for one of California's largest
bookmaking organizations.

300
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:50,508
<i>We didn't know then that Vince Walters'
Tri-State Wire Service

301
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:51,942
<i>was actually behind it.

302
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,992
<i>And that Mal Granger
was the technical brains.

303
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:57,944
<i>His improvements ran the daily take
up to staggering figures.

304
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,136
They're on the track in Chicago
and ready to go.

305
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:13,621
Where's Vince?
-In Mal's workshop.

306
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:18,452
And there they go. They're ready
in Chicago at 36 1/2

307
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:20,637
It's a switch on those
walkie-talkie radios, huh?

308
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,963
That's right and miniature.

309
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,515
If it works.
-It'll work.

310
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,331
He receives me
through this hearing aid, see?

311
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:27,602
And the amplifier and microphone become
a transmitter

312
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:28,749
and that's how he gets back at me.

313
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,294
His cane here serves as an aerial.

314
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,681
Pop, just keep that ring
right on the metal band, will you?

315
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,495
The only trouble we might get into

316
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,653
is if a federal monitor car
picked up his frequency.

317
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,670
Then they could triangulate the beam.
How does that feel, Pop?

318
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:42,427
Fine, fine. However I must say
that I feel utterly ridiculous

319
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,651
being wired for sound.

320
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,374
Still the erector set kid, huh?

321
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:47,617
Well, why work when
electricity will do it for you?

322
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,028
There's things it hasn't been able
to do for me.

323
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:51,036
Mal wants to try out this new
gadget today, Trudy.

324
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:53,045
I thought maybe you'd better take him
out to the track with you.

325
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:54,320
Show him how you work.

326
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:55,947
Things have getting
a little hot out there.

327
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:57,121
It'll be my pleasure.

328
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,204
Madame.

329
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,121
Eight on top.

330
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:42,676
Twelve.

331
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:44,505
Two and a half.

332
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,156
Eight.

333
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,788
Two.

334
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,288
and twenty on the bottom.

335
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:55,705
All set, Pop.

336
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,770
Let's test it once from the grandstand.

337
00:16:58,512 --> 00:17:00,827
Officer, can you tell me
where the coffee shop is?

338
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:02,043
Right over the grandstand.

339
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,297
I say, officer...

340
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,793
You're just the man I was looking for.

341
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,808
My eyesight isn't too good.

342
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,918
I wonder.

343
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:11,956
Could you give me
the odds on this race?

344
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:14,234
Sure. Number 1, 8 to1

345
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:17,721
Number 1, 8 to 1

346
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,543
Number 2, 12 to 1

347
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:21,575
Number 3, 5 to 2

348
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,081
<i>Number 4, 5 to 2

349
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:24,756
<i>Number 5, 8 to 1

350
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:25,906
Number 6

351
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:26,844
2 to 1

352
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,529
Number 7, 20 to 1

353
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:30,579
Thank you, sir, thank you.
-Don't mention it.

354
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:32,210
This is the life, Sonny.

355
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:35,663
You put horses and radio together and
what do you get? Nothing but money.

356
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,531
You mean Vince's got it.

357
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,158
We're just a couple of hired hands.

358
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,625
I don't see him cutting you in.

359
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,119
That's because I'm the shy type.
I haven't asked him yet.

360
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:45,169
When the time comes, he'll put out.

361
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:47,379
About time for those dogs to get going.

362
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:49,646
Hey, they got Trudy.

363
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:52,171
The pigs just grabbed her.
They're taking her away.

364
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:00,889
Hey, Pop, take over.
They just pinched Trudy.

365
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:02,149
Sonny.

366
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,062
You see, child? You're dated.

367
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:08,332
From now on, the wire service
is strictly Superman stuff.

368
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:09,918
What happened?

369
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,965
They gave me the old heave-ho.

370
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:14,015
Warned me never to darken
their track again.

371
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:16,104
I guess that washes me out.

372
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:19,404
You don't know anybody who needs
a slightly used signaller, do you?

373
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,457
I'll put an ad in the paper for you.

374
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:23,507
I'm afraid I'm too much of a specialist.

375
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:26,853
Guess I should have married the boy
whose father owned the supermarket.

376
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,191
Uh-uh. I'm allergic to that word
if you don't mind.

377
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:30,919
Supermarket?
-No, marriage.

378
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,512
Makes me break out in a rash.

379
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,394
Don't worry. I won't be around long
enough to start you scratching.

380
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:38,322
Maybe you ought to stick around. Maybe
we can find something else for you to do

381
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:40,556
We?
-That's right, we.

382
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:43,683
You sound like someone who thinks he's
going someplace.

383
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:48,332
I'm not one to brag but...
Why don't you stick around and find out?

384
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:50,832
Might be interesting at that.

385
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,527
Look, Ma, one hand.

386
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:00,444
Keep calm, little man. Keep calm.

387
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:03,135
You sure it's all right to try it here?
Suppose the cops saw us? 

388
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:05,169
All we're doing is using
their wire fence for an aerial.

389
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:07,039
If it works here,
it'll work at the racetrack.

390
00:19:07,973 --> 00:19:09,808
This is a low frequency transmitter,
Vince.

391
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,858
I'm saving it for the day they
crack down on Pop.

392
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,453
With the dough I put into this stuff,
I could own a radio station.

393
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,203
With the dough you're making,
you could buy a network.

394
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:17,478
Let's have your leg, Chippie.

395
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,182
Hope you don't get electrocuted.

396
00:19:20,232 --> 00:19:22,232
Always kidding...I hope.

397
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,052
Hey, what's that?

398
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:26,903
That spring needle sets up the circuit.

399
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:30,058
The wires on your leg run
to a low frequency carrier transmitter.

400
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:31,473
The batteries are in that case.

401
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:33,956
We put this telegraph key
in your right pants pocket.

402
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,483
I'm left-handed.
All right. Your left pants pocket.

403
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,974
Now all you gotta do is
make like a telegrapher.

404
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:40,117
Come on.

405
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,708
When he leans against this wire fence,
he's a walking radio station.

406
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,272
Of course, at the track, he'll have
all of these gadgets under his clothes.

407
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:50,185
I still don't get
all of this electrical stuff.

408
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:51,963
What I want to know is
how do we pick him up.

409
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:53,510
That's what we got the car for.

410
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,182
It's rigged to pick up his signals.

411
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,660
The car keeps circling the track
while he broadcasts.

412
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,912
Then they phone the dope to you.
Want to try it, Vince?

413
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:00,927
Let's go.

414
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:13,226
You sure got the angles, Mal.

415
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,840
If it was anybody but Vince,
he'd give you part of the take.

416
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,178
He'll cut me in, Chippie.

417
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,678
I got him by the short hairs right now.

418
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:21,894
I think they're ready. Start sending.

419
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,057
Here's hoping.

420
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:24,394
Don't worry. It'll work.

421
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,519
Believe me, I know.

422
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:28,401
I was down here myself and tried it
last night. Come on.

423
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:40,503
Nice wine, nice lunch, nice girl.

424
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:42,040
Nice day.

425
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,540
That seems to cover everything.

426
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,298
What's so special about today?

427
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,725
I don't know. Days are like people.

428
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,583
They have a kind of personality
of their own.

429
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:52,661
Take today, for instance. I like today.

430
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:54,046
Any reason?

431
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,409
I got a hunch it's liable to be
lucky for me.

432
00:20:57,277 --> 00:20:59,277
Yep, I think today's my lucky day.

433
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,326
Excuse me.

434
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:02,571
Mr. Granger, something's gone sour
at the track.

435
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:04,705
The wires have gone dead.
Every book in town's been calling.

436
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,755
Even I can't get through.
The phones are swamped.

437
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,825
I've been afraid of something like this.

438
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,290
I think things will just have to
work themselves out.

439
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,870
But, Mr. Granger...
-You heard me.

440
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,236
This wouldn't have anything to do with
being your lucky day, would it?

441
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,416
Like arranging to have Pop picked up?

442
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:23,998
Why would I want to do
anything like that?

443
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:26,498
You say the FCC picked him up?

444
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:29,649
Well, hold everything.
I'll get Granger right on it.

445
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:31,497
He's got another way of
handling the track.

446
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:35,012
Where's Mal?

447
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,799
He took Trudy to lunch
over at the Blue Boar.

448
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,407
Get him on the phone right away.
-Yes, sir.

449
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,590
Wire's down.

450
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
Wire trouble. Keep it closed.

451
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:45,909
Rocco?

452
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:47,418
Put Granger on.

453
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:49,014
Wire trouble.

454
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:53,601
Mal, what kind of an outfit you think
I'm running around here anyhow?

455
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:55,120
Get over here. We're in trouble.

456
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:01,392
You'd like it better
if I came there, huh?

457
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:02,930
Why, for two cents I'd...

458
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:07,707
All right. I'll be right over.
Wait in Rocco's office for me.

459
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,468
Well, get it up. We've got a lot
of work to do.

460
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,630
You've got to get a man out to the track
with that new equipment.

461
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:18,944
They knocked off Pop today.

462
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:20,488
You can quit shouting, Vince.
I heard you.

463
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,970
But maybe you didn't hear me right.

464
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:24,936
I'm not taking the new stuff
out to the track.

465
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:27,189
So that's the way it is, huh?

466
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,581
OK, I'll get somebody else
to take it out.

467
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:32,290
Not with my equipment, you won't.
I've already taken it out of the shop.

468
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,017
I know it was your money but it was my
brains that made you that dough.

469
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,053
You think you can hijack me

470
00:22:38,077 --> 00:22:40,369
just because I gave a telephone
company sucker a break?

471
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:41,273
Get smart, Vince.

472
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:43,160
Ever since I hooked up your outfit all
over the state, 

473
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:44,714
you've been rolling in cabbage
and I know it.

474
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,746
Your take is five times what it was.

475
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:48,796
But to keep it that way,
you gotta keep me.

476
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,611
And if I don't?

477
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:56,883
I've handled guys like you before.
You better think that over.

478
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,874
I don't have to.

479
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,247
You never got rid of anything or anybody
that could make you a buck.

480
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:03,186
With that new equipment,
I can get a lot of guys to finance me.

481
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,415
Your books are gonna be looking around
for a new service.

482
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:07,775
So, as of right now,
you're out of business.

483
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,662
What do you want?

484
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:12,816
Twenty percent of your take
from everything.

485
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:14,412
That still leaves you 80%.

486
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:16,315
That's better than 100% of nothing.

487
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:23,257
OK.

488
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,725
Thanks.

489
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,400
Hello, Syd? Mal.

490
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,882
You know that new show
down at the Biltmore?

491
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:33,901
Yeah.

492
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:35,951
Any chance you can get me a couple
for tonight up front?

493
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,185
You can?

494
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,815
That's swell, thanks.

495
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:41,123
Nice guy, that Syd.

496
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,219
<i>During the next three months,
the gangster squad knocked off

497
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:46,771
<i>all the bookies it could find.

498
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:49,271
<i>But they popped up like rats
in another hole.

499
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,017
<i>By then, I knew the only way
to drive them out of business

500
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,067
<i>was to crack down on the
Tri-State Wire Service.

501
00:23:54,787 --> 00:23:56,787
<i>But so far, they were within the law.

502
00:23:56,989 --> 00:23:58,537
<i>One thing I was certain of

503
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,317
<i>The bookmakers were paying off
to the service at a drive-in.

504
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:03,434
<i>We had these small fry marked for arrest

505
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,484
<i>but it was the big shots we were after.

506
00:24:05,953 --> 00:24:08,862
<i>I staked out the place for a few days
looking the boys over.

507
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:12,319
<i>And I found that Mal Granger was
beginning to throw his weight around.

508
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,243
Lemon.
-Yeah.

509
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:16,235
Apple?

510
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:18,735
Hello, Red.

511
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:21,052
Things are going all right
with you guys, huh?

512
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:23,131
Stick with us and every night
will be Saturday night.

513
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,641
So long, fellas.
-Right.

514
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:29,444
We couldn't make it any faster
if printed it ourselves.

515
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:31,998
You picked a winner the day
you tied up with me, Chippie.

516
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:32,761
You said it.

517
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:34,895
Just think of you wasting your time
with the telephone company

518
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,806
and me fooling around with two-bit book.

519
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,703
Where is it?

520
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:48,861
It's kind of light.

521
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:51,077
They hit me again yesterday, Mal.
Two grand.

522
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:52,587
I had to pay off right then, or else.

523
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:53,826
That's your tough luck.

524
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,026
You better have the rest of
what you owe Walters in here.

525
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:57,402
Plus the interest.

526
00:24:57,472 --> 00:24:59,087
Do you think I like owing him money?

527
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,287
I'll try to make the rest of it
next week.

528
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,603
No soap, Weiss.

529
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:05,383
You get it up by 3 this afternoon
or you're out of business.

530
00:25:06,528 --> 00:25:08,524
Walters will be waiting for you
at the office.

531
00:25:15,062 --> 00:25:17,384
I want the dough, Weiss,
and I want it now.

532
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,957
You've had five months
and you still haven't paid off.

533
00:25:20,457 --> 00:25:23,027
I've done the best I could.
But at 10% interest I...

534
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:25,307
I've only got a little book,
Mr. Walters.

535
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:27,000
You haven't got that now.

536
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,368
You're through, Weiss.

537
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,063
You can't do that.

538
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:33,013
I got a wife, two kids.
I gotta keep going.

539
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:35,293
You can't do that!

540
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,802
Why don't you watch what you're doing?

541
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,998
A wife and two kids, huh, Weiss?

542
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:47,976
There are a couple of boys in town
I might speak to about them.

543
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:51,721
How would you like to have the wife
and two kids worked over, Weiss?

544
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,919
You can't do that.

545
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,533
I won't let you.

546
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,033
I won't let anyone.

547
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:05,813
He got right past me. Went right...

548
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,112
Somebody better call an ambulance.

549
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,119
He won't need an ambulance.

550
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:21,551
Weiss was found as suicide in his car
on Kingsley Road, Granger.

551
00:26:21,804 --> 00:26:23,584
Maybe that's why you don't want to talk.

552
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:26,084
Can I help it
if Weiss bumped himself off?

553
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:28,156
I told you he was crazy
when he was in the office.

554
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:29,360
He even took a shot at me.

555
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,495
Why did he come to your office?

556
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:33,203
He wanted to see Walters about a loan.

557
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:35,078
He said his book had been hit
and he needed some money.

558
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:38,549
From what his wife tells us,
you were already bleeding him.

559
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,317
He'd been paying Walters off for months.

560
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:43,055
I don't know anything about that.
I just work there.

561
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:45,555
What's the gangster squad
have on Granger?

562
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,880
Not too much.

563
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,796
The word's around town that he owns
a piece of Tri-State himself.

564
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:53,516
We saw you talking to Weiss this morning
at the drive-in stand.

565
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,918
What is that about?

566
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:55,745
Nothing.

567
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,630
He just asked me
when he could see Walters.

568
00:26:58,164 --> 00:26:59,779
That's all for now, Granger.

569
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,538
If I want you again, I'll call you.

570
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:19,866
Granger.

571
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:24,171
With Walters gone, it looks like you're
going to be Mr. Big over at Tri-State.

572
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:25,900
If you're smart, you'll get out now.

573
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
You know, they all end up like Walters.

574
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:23,980
Quite an improvement for a guy who
didn't even have a change of overalls.

575
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:24,991
Yeah, you like them?

576
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:26,768
All depends on
what you're going to put inside them.

577
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,118
What kind of crack is that?

578
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,208
I just wonder if you're the same guy
I used to know.

579
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,756
Just the same except for money
in my pockets instead of wire,

580
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:34,279
tailored suits instead of overalls.

581
00:28:34,315 --> 00:28:36,480
I hope you and your wardrobe
will be very happy.

582
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:39,636
On the way out, tell the cook to send me
some orange juice and coffee.

583
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:40,938
Yes, master.

584
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:44,793
Have you an appointment? Mr. Granger's
only seeing bankers these days.

585
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:47,467
What's eating her?

586
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,866
I used to think you two cooked up
a little deal between you.

587
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:52,194
Trudy's pretty sold on you.

588
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,622
I know, but that's not for me.

589
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:55,178
Some guys were meant to be single.

590
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:56,872
I hope I never fall in love, Chippie.

591
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:58,103
It's only asking for trouble.

592
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,708
That love business is
strictly storybook stuff.

593
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,769
What I got to tell you
ain't no storybook stuff.

594
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:05,694
Bookies are screaming about you
hiking the price of the service.

595
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,102
They say you're murdering them.

596
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,009
They can afford it.

597
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,918
They gotta deal with me
or they're out of business.

598
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:11,784
Why should I give those guys
a free ride?

599
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,124
I ain't forgetting what you done for me.

600
00:29:15,174 --> 00:29:16,571
But somebody's gotta tell you.

601
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:19,575
Maybe you're getting a little too
successful for your own good.

602
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,368
Right now, you've got all of California
tied up and everybody knows it.

603
00:29:22,414 --> 00:29:25,741
Get too big and those big guys back east
move in. You know what that means.

604
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,141
Relax. I'll do the worrying
for this outfit.

605
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:30,637
Maybe that's one thing
you never thought of...

606
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:32,744
Maybe I'm big enough for the big boys.

607
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:34,980
<i>Mal didn't know it.

608
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:37,993
<i>But the national syndicate was already
eyeing his operation.

609
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:40,980
<i>Their headquarters was in
an office building in Cleveland.

610
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,336
<i>They had impressive offices
and they should.

611
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:48,358
<i>Last year  more than $8 billion was bet
with bookmakers in this country.

612
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:52,637
<i>More than the combined earnings
of 25 of our largest corporations.

613
00:29:52,863 --> 00:29:57,331
<i>And the National Wire Service got
a big slice of that $8 billion racket.

614
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:02,274
Ghastly stuff.

615
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:06,620
If I hadn't picked up this duodenal
worrying about our affairs,

616
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:09,717
I'd be able to eat like a man
instead of a kitten.

617
00:30:10,537 --> 00:30:12,537
What about Jake Miller?

618
00:30:12,682 --> 00:30:14,682
Anyone looked over the Florida accounts?

619
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:15,712
I have.

620
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,351
He was socking down on us all right.

621
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:20,423
Took us for $43,000 entering bets
on winners for himself.

622
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,923
That's bad, very bad.

623
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,231
The man can't trust his own clients.

624
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:27,577
How long has he been with us?

625
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:29,627
Five, six years.

626
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:32,496
He's been screaming ever since we cut
ourselves in for part of his book.

627
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:34,428
That's unfortunate.

628
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:37,426
Particularly so if word
got around that he

629
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,958
took this money without any retaliation.

630
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:43,384
Some of the other bookies
might get the same idea.

631
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:45,509
Are we agreed?

632
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,816
All right, Steve, I'll leave it to you.

633
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:50,596
You know some people
in Miami, don't you?

634
00:30:50,646 --> 00:30:51,849
What does he get?

635
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:55,564
I think he's a very sick man.

636
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,430
I don't believe he'll ever get well.

637
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,930
I'll see that he doesn't.

638
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:04,203
About California, Carl, I have
the data on Granger.

639
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:06,231
Walters was knocked off
about a year ago.

640
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:08,115
Granger took over the Tri-State service.

641
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:10,532
This year, he'll clear
about a million two.

642
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:14,279
That isn't so much. I though the whole
state was dancing to his tune.

643
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:15,998
It is but this is piker stuff.

644
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:18,061
This is just the take from
the wire service alone.

645
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:19,799
If we were to move in on him,

646
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,122
set up a whole operation.

647
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:22,787
That would be a nice venture.

648
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:26,159
I've always thought we should do
something about the Pacific coast.

649
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:30,079
It's ridiculous that this syndicate
has never gone past Kansas City.

650
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:32,753
What would you suggest?

651
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:34,512
Let me look Granger up.

652
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:37,636
Nothing too exciting. Just a little
suggestion he might find it more

653
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:39,998
profitable to come in with us.
That sort of thing.

654
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,819
Very good.

655
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,868
But I've already had Granger looked up.

656
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,328
I'm sure you'll show him
that in the long run

657
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:50,698
no one man has ever been able to keep

658
00:31:51,198 --> 00:31:55,287
the wire service
as a personal enterprise.

659
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:58,309
By the way, I uh...

660
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:00,910
I'm leaving for Palm Springs
myself next week.

661
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:05,471
Why don't you go down ahead
and look Granger over?

662
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:07,459
And Larry...

663
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:09,959
Take the wife along.

664
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:13,302
She might like southern California.

665
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
How long have you been here?

666
00:32:22,752 --> 00:32:24,024
About two hours.

667
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:28,601
Why do you suppose I've been sitting
with you that long?

668
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:31,742
Maybe because you sort of like me?

669
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:33,667
And I kind of like you.

670
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,723
That's what you think, is it? Well, I'll
tell you the truth.

671
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,653
All day I've been feeling like a rat.

672
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,032
For a long time I've been feeling
like a rat.

673
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:48,934
This afternoon I felt like talking to
someone who spoke my own language.

674
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,432
And that's you.

675
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,932
A great, big,

676
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:54,686
good looking rat.

677
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,600
You need another drink?

678
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:57,905
Who doesn't?

679
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:02,607
You're going to get a great shock
when my husband shows up.

680
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,499
He's even a bigger rat than you are.

681
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:06,665
You're a little tight.

682
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:08,128
 But very sweet.

683
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:10,157
And you haven't got a husband.

684
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,465
Hasn't she?
-Darling.

685
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:15,175
This is my husband, Mr...

686
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:17,584
I'm sorry, I...

687
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:19,545
I didn't get the name.

688
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:20,713
You never do.

689
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,030
Well, if you'll excuse me.

690
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,628
You ought to pick them a little tougher.

691
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:28,716
The one I have is tough enough.

692
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,106
How did the meeting go?

693
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:32,697
Is Carl still living on milk?

694
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:33,993
Carl's all right.

695
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,641
Maybe he sees a lot of things I don't.

696
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:40,258
How would you like a little trip
to the coast, baby?

697
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:41,465
I'd love it.

698
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:43,965
I've always wanted to live
in Beverly Hills.

699
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:07,487
Hello, Tim. What's the matter? 
You still look down in the dumps.

700
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:10,277
And for good reason. Things ain't so
good with some of us boys

701
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:12,365
since you upped the prices.

702
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:14,968
Come on, Tim, you're doing fine.
You can afford it.

703
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:22,027
They tell me you're Mal Granger.
I'm Larry Mason.

704
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:23,093
Could I have a word with you?

705
00:34:23,112 --> 00:34:24,096
What are you doing way out here?

706
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:25,971
Came to see a ball game.
-Hope you enjoy it.

707
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:29,286
I also had another reason for coming.
I thought you and I could have a talk.

708
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,466
That's a long way to come
without being sure.

709
00:34:31,494 --> 00:34:32,528
You should have written me first.

710
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,693
The mail belongs to the government.

711
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:35,716
I don't trust much of my business
with the government.

712
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,041
How about watching the game with me?

713
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:38,788
Sorry, I got some people inside
waiting for me.

714
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:40,187
How about after the game?
-I got a date.

715
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:42,128
What have you got against
talking things over?

716
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:44,440
Nothing except I already know
what you're going to talk about.

717
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:45,905
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-That's all right.

718
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,838
Well, are we going?

719
00:34:46,888 --> 00:34:48,888
Gail, this is Mal Granger. My wife.

720
00:34:49,198 --> 00:34:50,656
Hello.
-Well, hello.

721
00:34:50,706 --> 00:34:52,512
Sure you won't change your mind
about joining us?

722
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:55,474
She's very pretty but I already told you
I got people inside waiting.

723
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,405
What about cocktails tomorrow
at my place?

724
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,906
I'm not to far from poverty
to accept a free drink.

725
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,001
All right, 7 O'Clock. I'll give you
the address.

726
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:04,660
Don't bother. I knew when you
got in town and where you're living.

727
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:05,768
I'll see you tomorrow.

728
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:06,831
Oh uh...

729
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,961
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Mason.
-Thank you.

730
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:41,436
Nice layout you got here, Larry.

731
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,931
You must be figuring on staying.

732
00:35:42,981 --> 00:35:45,358
Been thinking of going
into business out here.

733
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:47,525
Win anything on the game last night?

734
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:48,987
I don't gamble anymore.

735
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:51,487
Why should you when you've already got
a sure thing?

736
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:54,125
While I'm here, I'd like to look over
that setup of yours.

737
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:57,292
I hear that for an independent operation
it's right up to the minute.

738
00:35:57,499 --> 00:36:00,073
For a guy that's only been in town for
a couple of days, you've heard a lot.

739
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:02,547
Thanks, I don't show it anymore.
It's top secret.

740
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,065
No reason why it should be, is there?

741
00:36:04,474 --> 00:36:07,715
After all, I'm in the same business.
We might compare methods.

742
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:11,797
As a matter of fact, I might even have
a proposition for you.

743
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:15,088
Thanks, I'm not in the market
for any propositions right now.

744
00:36:16,448 --> 00:36:18,064
I like things the way they are.

745
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,482
A man never lost any money
just listening.

746
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:24,028
Could make him a wad of dough and save
him a lot of trouble at the same time.

747
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:27,358
If you don't come in with us, you might
run into some other outfit

748
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,943
that wouldn't be so cooperative.

749
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:29,789
Really?

750
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:33,096
I thought your syndicate was the only
one big enough to operate on that scale.

751
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:34,898
But you're wasting your time.

752
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,932
If you wanted to talk business,

753
00:36:36,982 --> 00:36:38,522
you should have sent Carl Stevens.

754
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:40,341
I only deal with the top man.

755
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:42,855
I'm not exactly an office boy myself.

756
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,423
But if that's the way you feel.

757
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:46,161
Must you two talk business all evening?

758
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:47,983
Tell me about Palm Springs.

759
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:50,245
Larry and I are going down there
this weekend.

760
00:36:50,728 --> 00:36:53,153
There isn't much doing there
now that the season's over.

761
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:54,844
But if you want a lot of rest
and some sun.

762
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:55,887
Not too much rest.

763
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,747
I like to keep moving, don't I, Larry?

764
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,881
It's all we've been doing
since we were married.

765
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,061
Don't have a chance to think
too much then.

766
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:07,350
Maybe that's why she keeps me broke
buying clothes. Just something to do.

767
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:10,319
Carl's down at Palm Springs right now.

768
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,361
Why don't you come down with us
this weekend and meet him?

769
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:14,292
Perhaps Mr. Granger wouldn't like it.

770
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:18,572
With the season over, he might not find
anything interesting to do.

771
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:20,989
I don't know. I think I might find it
very interesting.

772
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:23,445
Things have got a little dull
around here anyhow.

773
00:37:23,495 --> 00:37:24,935
Maybe I'll take you up on that.

774
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:33,227
Sure you won't have something, Gail?

775
00:37:33,324 --> 00:37:34,983
Nothing right now, thanks.

776
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:37,748
More medicine.

777
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:42,390
I don't know how you two
can just eat like that.

778
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,813
I've taken the very best care of myself.

779
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,474
And that's my reward.

780
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:49,213
I haven't had a decent night's sleep
since I got here.

781
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,250
Maybe you're taking on
too much business, Carl.

782
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:52,722
You ought to take it easy, relax.

783
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:54,882
We're always geared
to take on more business.

784
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:56,174
Oh now, Larry.

785
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:59,566
Mal has every reason to wonder
at our sudden interest in him.

786
00:38:02,395 --> 00:38:04,395
Haven't you, Mal?
-Hm?

787
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:06,895
It is attractive here, isn't it?

788
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:08,311
Yeah.

789
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,276
You should think about going in with us.

790
00:38:11,313 --> 00:38:12,963
We don't want to move in on you.

791
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:14,653
We want to cut you in as a full partner.

792
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:17,270
I'm not interested in
getting any bigger, thanks.

793
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,678
I like things the way they are.

794
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,839
But you might run into trouble
at any minute.

795
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,083
We're prepared to handle that for you.

796
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:27,466
Like the law or some undesirable element
wanting to cut in.

797
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:29,307
We can handle that.

798
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:31,708
Give you and the service
full protection.

799
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,620
I haven't had any trouble so far.

800
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,966
But if it comes,
I think I can handle it.

801
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:37,998
It's more than giving you
just protection.

802
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:41,937
It's cutting you in on profits
you never dreamed of.

803
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:44,402
Suppose something went sour
here on the coast.

804
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:47,331
You'd be getting a share
from our other outlets.

805
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:51,442
You might well call it an annuity.

806
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:56,055
What is your offer anyway?

807
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,768
A very handsome one.

808
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:02,836
You would still retain
a half interest in Tri-State.

809
00:39:03,336 --> 00:39:07,103
And also receive a fair share of our
profits throughout the country.

810
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,988
If you have an attorney
you'd care to consult...

811
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Thanks, I'm my own attorney.

812
00:39:13,107 --> 00:39:14,365
I'll think about it.

813
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:26,856
I'm gonna get cleaned up.

814
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:28,282
I'll see you.

815
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:33,444
I wouldn't be too hasty.

816
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:36,485
Things are working out
exactly as I planned.

817
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:40,020
That's plenty, Mac.

818
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:41,091
Yes, sir.

819
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:44,284
Here you are. Keep the change.
-Thank you, sir.

820
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,834
A girl could get awfully drunk
looking in every bar around town for you

821
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:02,931
Anything wrong with that?

822
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:06,504
Is it all right if I sit down?

823
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:07,596
Why not?

824
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,425
Have a drink?

825
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,011
I'll have a double.

826
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:13,597
Double what?

827
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:15,659
Double yours.

828
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,875
Hey, Mac.
-Yes, sir?

829
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,944
Do it twice.
-OK.

830
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,307
You must like this stuff.

831
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:24,206
No, not especially.

832
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:26,982
I like what I see
in the bottom of the glass.

833
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,893
Getting away from it all, huh?

834
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,030
Just from myself.

835
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:37,704
Let's dance.

836
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:40,533
Sure.

837
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:14,042
The boys seem pretty certain of me.

838
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:17,291
They decided long ago.

839
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:18,738
What about you?

840
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:21,759
You could have saved yourself
a lot of trouble.

841
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:24,259
I've already decided to go in with them.

842
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:25,964
How could that save me trouble?

843
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,943
This is all part
of the buildup, isn't it?

844
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:30,748
Beautiful girl, soft music, hard drinks.

845
00:41:30,798 --> 00:41:31,700
Oh, sure.

846
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,866
I'm the prize you win if you throw
the ring over the right peg.

847
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:35,961
Yeah?

848
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:39,299
I don't know if I can afford to buy
a chance. Or are you giving them away?

849
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:54,648
Gail, wait a minute.

850
00:41:55,897 --> 00:41:57,897
I was out of line.

851
00:41:58,397 --> 00:42:00,397
Gail, please.

852
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,214
I had you figured all wrong.

853
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:03,398
I'm sorry.

854
00:42:05,953 --> 00:42:07,451
We all make mistakes.

855
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,663
Anyway, I did tell you that I'd gone out
looking for you.

856
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:13,035
And there is a guy named Larry.

857
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:15,782
Let's call that my mistake.

858
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,583
My big one.

859
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:21,530
You know,

860
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:23,370
You don't look as though you...

861
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:26,367
Well as though you...

862
00:42:26,593 --> 00:42:28,494
Belong to a big shot int the syndicate?

863
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,957
Yeah.

864
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:32,064
What do I look like?

865
00:42:32,564 --> 00:42:35,558
Like someone who went to
one of those smart girl's schools.

866
00:42:35,758 --> 00:42:37,892
You know, belong to the
country club set.

867
00:42:37,942 --> 00:42:38,805
I did.

868
00:42:40,226 --> 00:42:41,871
Until I met Larry.

869
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:45,562
Innocent young girl taken in
by smooth talking stranger?

870
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:47,815
No, I knew all about him.

871
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:50,489
But you see, I'd never know anyone
like him before.

872
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:55,022
Probably would have gotten over it if
my family hadn't raised such a fuss.

873
00:42:58,462 --> 00:43:00,161
Is this really important to you?

874
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:03,985
You're important to me.

875
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:21,489
Come on.

876
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:55,033
Hi, Pete.

877
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,062
What do you know, George?
-Nothing much, Tim.

878
00:43:57,075 --> 00:43:58,872
Say Tim, what's this all about?

879
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:00,282
I don't know but I don't like it.

880
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,250
Why should Granger bring all the
bookies together

881
00:44:02,269 --> 00:44:04,195
unless he's going to slip us
some more bad news?

882
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:07,628
He picked a good place for it all right.
A gas works yet.

883
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:22,686
Sorry to be late, men, but I got tied up
in a meeting with my new partners.

884
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,180
That's right.

885
00:44:25,213 --> 00:44:27,495
That's why I called this
meeting here today.

886
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:29,488
Right in the same gas house
where Vince Walters

887
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:31,607
first organized the Tri-State
Wire Service.

888
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:34,991
We've all come a long way since then
and we're going to go a lot further.

889
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:37,873
I just made a deal with the National
Press Service.

890
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,720
How do you like that?

891
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,923
...right in the neck.
-That's right, the big boys.

892
00:44:44,964 --> 00:44:47,228
Carl Stevens, Larry Mason, Joe Gish

893
00:44:47,278 --> 00:44:48,730
and Steve Marshak.

894
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:51,260
This is Larry Mason standing
right over here.

895
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,687
He's gonna tell you what the new deal
is all about.

896
00:44:58,644 --> 00:45:02,253
We want all you boys to get together
in a little protective association.

897
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:05,716
We've got some trouble coming up here
and the syndicate's

898
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:07,205
prepared to handle it for you.

899
00:45:07,697 --> 00:45:10,624
It'll take a little juice,
 a little money in the right places.

900
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:13,186
But we'll see that you get
a buck's worth of protection 

901
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:14,823
for every dollar you put out.

902
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,089
And by forming a protection association,

903
00:45:18,122 --> 00:45:20,442
we can handle it in a businesslike way.

904
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:21,804
With our money?

905
00:45:21,827 --> 00:45:23,452
Suppose we don't want to join?

906
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:26,061
You'll change your minds when
you've heard the play-by-play.

907
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:29,070
I don't know if you men know anything
about the politics in this state,

908
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,581
but if you don't, you should.

909
00:45:30,752 --> 00:45:33,898
Right now up in Sacramento,
there's a bill to legalize bookies.

910
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:36,008
If that happens,
we're all out of business.

911
00:45:36,058 --> 00:45:37,793
The state will be taking our gravy.

912
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:39,982
We've not only got to whip that.

913
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,659
But we've got to out box the governor's
new crime commission.

914
00:45:42,709 --> 00:45:45,728
Those guys can't be bought.
So, if you want to stay in business,

915
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:47,560
You're gonna have to pay for it.

916
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:49,476
'Cause it'll cost money

917
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:51,976
for a lobby of our own.
-How much?

918
00:45:52,038 --> 00:45:54,856
We're not going to have any hike
in the price of the wire service.

919
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:58,355
All we're asking is 20% of every book.

920
00:45:58,453 --> 00:46:01,428
He's out of his mind!
-He'll make us broke in no time!

921
00:46:01,498 --> 00:46:02,844
Now wait a minute.

922
00:46:03,737 --> 00:46:05,994
Nobody is forcing you to join.

923
00:46:06,311 --> 00:46:07,658
But if you don't...

924
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:11,341
The wire service can only take care
of its own customers.

925
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:13,841
Count me out.
-Me too.

926
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:20,698
I'm glad to see
the rest of you guys are smart.

927
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,742
I've got all your phone numbers.

928
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,264
If you want to join up,

929
00:46:24,764 --> 00:46:26,764
let the men at the door
know as you go out.

930
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:29,481
REIGN OF TERROR
HITS BOOKIES

931
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:34,561
Press the buzzer, Pop.

932
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:41,636
Get out of here, all of you.

933
00:46:45,771 --> 00:46:47,771
You're not going to get away with this!

934
00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:01,732
<i>The bookmakers were no match for the
strong-arm tactics of the hoodlums.

935
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:04,773
<i>To stay in business, they had to
submit to every demand for tribute.

936
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:07,928
<i>The west coast soon became
one of the syndicate's richest assets.

937
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:11,113
<i>Mal Granger had come a long way
from the telephone company.

938
00:47:12,465 --> 00:47:14,802
Here, you can take care of these things
for me.

939
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,325
I got to go over to the Masons' anyway.

940
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:18,175
You don't spend much time
on business anymore.

941
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:20,141
Why should I? The business takes
care of itself.

942
00:47:20,178 --> 00:47:22,015
And, I've got you to count up
the money for me.

943
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:24,539
That's what I have been doing, Mal,
and it doesn't add up right.

944
00:47:24,733 --> 00:47:26,733
Add it up again.
Maybe you misplaced a decimal.

945
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,129
Me or somebody else did.

946
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:30,559
You're supposed to be getting
a 50-50 break, aren't you?

947
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:31,230
That's right.

948
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,326
The syndicate took over
six hundred thousand last month.

949
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:36,208
You got one hundred forty six thousand.

950
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:38,258
That's not even 70-30, Mal.

951
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,603
Let me see that again.

952
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:45,786
They wouldn't do that to me
in my own town.

953
00:47:45,836 --> 00:47:46,799
Wouldn't they though.

954
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,189
Remember they insisted on having
their own runners?

955
00:47:50,216 --> 00:47:51,406
Where did you get those figures?

956
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:53,603
The bookies trust me, Mal.
They wanted you to see them.

957
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:54,405
They figured if you knew 

958
00:47:54,449 --> 00:47:56,800
you were being taken like they were,
you'd do something about it.

959
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,023
I'm going to have a long talk
with somebody right now.

960
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,554
Do you think she could do anything
about it?

961
00:48:00,574 --> 00:48:01,544
What do you mean, "she"?

962
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,269
That's not the only trouble
you're in, Mal.

963
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:05,295
Larry Mason isn't exactly stupid,
you know.

964
00:48:05,345 --> 00:48:06,868
You're a little bit out of line,
aren't you?

965
00:48:10,946 --> 00:48:12,155
I know, kid.

966
00:48:12,205 --> 00:48:13,691
He's not the same guy.

967
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,789
But maybe he'll come around.
It's worth waiting for.

968
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,727
Do you want to lay odds on that?

969
00:48:20,092 --> 00:48:21,675
Hi, Mal.

970
00:48:21,904 --> 00:48:23,373
I look a little different, don't I?

971
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:24,685
The boys did a good job on me.

972
00:48:24,765 --> 00:48:26,509
I guess I have to learn the hard way.

973
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:29,523
Mal, if you could stake me to a fresh
bankroll so I can open up again,

974
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:31,778
I'll go along with you all the way.
Will you give me a chance?

975
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:34,360
You had you chance, Tim. You better get
yourself a new racket.

976
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,107
I got troubles enough of my own.

977
00:48:44,078 --> 00:48:46,960
I'm sorry, Larry, you'll just have to
take off without me.

978
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:48,894
I don't feel athletic today.

979
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:53,364
Maybe you'd rather go down to Malibu
and build sandcastles.

980
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:56,083
That's right, make yourself
right at home.

981
00:48:56,138 --> 00:48:58,630
Maybe you didn't come to see me.
-I came to see you, all right.

982
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,590
I got a message for you and Carl.
You can get yourselves a new partner.

983
00:49:01,946 --> 00:49:03,946
You sound like things
are tough all over.

984
00:49:03,996 --> 00:49:05,996
Better let me buy you a cup of coffee.
-Never mind the coffee.

985
00:49:06,954 --> 00:49:08,471
All right, what is it?

986
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:09,499
You know what it is.

987
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,865
My agreement called for
a 50-50 cut out here.

988
00:49:11,897 --> 00:49:15,186
I got the figures that prove that all
I'm getting is about 30% to your 70.

989
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,210
There are certain expenses
we have to allow for.

990
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:18,906
And what if the figures
don't all check out?

991
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:20,975
You're averaging $45,000 a month more

992
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:22,400
than you were you when
you came in with us.

993
00:49:22,414 --> 00:49:24,531
I don't care what I'm averaging.
My agreement was for 50-50.

994
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:26,194
If I don't get it, I walk out.

995
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:28,739
It'll be interesting to see
how you do it.

996
00:49:29,093 --> 00:49:32,710
I've seen a few people try. But somehow,
they never seem to make it.

997
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:34,835
No, Mal, you're in.

998
00:49:35,027 --> 00:49:37,367
You came along for the ride
and I'm afraid you're with us

999
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:39,417
till the end of the line.

1000
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,273
You better have that coffee.
You look all upset.

1001
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:06,155
What's the matter, darling? Something's
been bothering you, hasn't it?

1002
00:50:06,418 --> 00:50:07,537
It's funny.

1003
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:10,037
I was supposed to be a smart girl.

1004
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,300
Played everything for laughs.

1005
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:14,444
Now I'm frightened.
-Of what?

1006
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:16,636
What might happen to you.

1007
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:17,830
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

1008
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,212
I'll play along with these jokers
until I can grab what they owe me.

1009
00:50:21,328 --> 00:50:23,328
Then we'll light out for keeps.

1010
00:50:23,376 --> 00:50:25,394
Nobody's ever been able to
walk out on them, Mal.

1011
00:50:25,444 --> 00:50:27,105
There's got to be a first time
for everything.

1012
00:50:27,603 --> 00:50:29,603
We found that out, haven't we?

1013
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:30,947
Yes.

1014
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:35,576
<i>He was building up
to the payoff right then.

1015
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:38,076
<i>All Granger needed was a shove.

1016
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:40,576
<i>It came along a lot sooner
than he expected.

1017
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,808
<i>It came the next Friday night
at the Legion Stadium.

1018
00:51:14,442 --> 00:51:15,923
Hello, Larry.

1019
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:17,683
Didn't know you liked the fights.

1020
00:51:17,763 --> 00:51:19,389
Me? I'm crazy about them.

1021
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,590
Particularly when I get in for free.

1022
00:51:21,632 --> 00:51:23,632
I found a ticket on Gail's dresser.

1023
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:26,750
She told me she'd never seen a fight
so I sent her a ticket.

1024
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:29,071
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have made it a pair.

1025
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:30,301
Sure you would, Mal.

1026
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,680
Peanuts?
-No thanks.

1027
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:34,061
A fight's not the fights
without peanuts.

1028
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,832
The kid in blue tights isn't too bad.
Gail would have got a kick out of him.

1029
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:42,718
Maybe you didn't hear. She had
a little accident this afternoon.

1030
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:44,711
Accident? When? What happened?

1031
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:46,339
Fell down some stairs.

1032
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:48,647
Hurt her jaw and nose.

1033
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:51,028
Got kind of a black eye too.

1034
00:51:51,857 --> 00:51:54,575
Doctor thought she'd better spend
the night in Hollywood Hospital.

1035
00:51:54,913 --> 00:51:56,913
Stairs, huh? Were you around
when it happened?

1036
00:51:56,963 --> 00:51:58,475
What a punch.

1037
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:01,048
That kid's really got it.

1038
00:52:01,722 --> 00:52:03,722
Sure, I was around.

1039
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:07,238
I figured maybe Gail was just tired.

1040
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,602
Not watching what she was doing.

1041
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:11,305
She's been getting around too much.

1042
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,930
Maybe she doesn't like the way
she's been living.

1043
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,670
Maybe that's why she gets around
so much.

1044
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,649
Could be.

1045
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,132
Who's been spoiling her, Mal?

1046
00:52:18,395 --> 00:52:20,942
Drive-ins, little bars places like this.

1047
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:23,789
You shouldn't do things like that
for a dame.

1048
00:52:24,097 --> 00:52:26,371
Especially if she doesn't belong to you.

1049
00:52:33,299 --> 00:52:35,711
Only a minute now.
I'm going to give you a sedative.

1050
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:44,495
Mal.

1051
00:52:45,282 --> 00:52:46,639
It was a good fight.

1052
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:49,139
But I'm afraid I underrated my opponent.

1053
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:51,632
I'd like to see him pick on someone
his own size.

1054
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:52,926
No, it wouldn't help.

1055
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:54,815
It would only end in a killing.

1056
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,290
If they killed you, I'd die with you.

1057
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,340
I can't stand around
and let this happen.

1058
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,321
Every time I'm not with you,
I'll be afraid...

1059
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:02,323
No, Mal.

1060
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,540
I don't care about
what Larry does to me.

1061
00:53:04,693 --> 00:53:06,693
But I do care about you.

1062
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:09,159
If anything happened to you.
-What am I supposed to do?

1063
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:10,612
Just sit here and relax?

1064
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:13,251
Right now, we've got to pretend
 we never felt this way.

1065
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:17,233
Mal, you've got to keep coming
to the house as if nothing happened.

1066
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:18,779
Will you?

1067
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:21,745
Sure.

1068
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:24,327
Sure, I'll come around.

1069
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,119
Maybe things will handle themselves.

1070
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,290
Remember the old gag?

1071
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:31,434
Time wounds all heels?

1072
00:53:54,701 --> 00:53:56,268
Want to see me, Mr. Granger?

1073
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:58,028
Yeah. Sit down.

1074
00:53:59,122 --> 00:54:01,122
I was feeling kind of lonesome tonight.

1075
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:05,001
Matter of fact,
I'm feeling very lonesome.

1076
00:54:05,631 --> 00:54:07,901
I thought you had many friends.
Only the other day i...

1077
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:08,668
Sure.

1078
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:09,849
I  know a lot of people.

1079
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,879
But they're not the right sort.

1080
00:54:15,447 --> 00:54:17,447
I need to meet one man, Rocco.

1081
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:20,341
One man who can do me a lot of good.

1082
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,180
Who is this man?
-I said I don't know him.

1083
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
But I need a man for a job.

1084
00:54:26,098 --> 00:54:27,418
A tough job.

1085
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:29,893
Surely, Mr. Granger, you know
many such men.

1086
00:54:29,943 --> 00:54:31,667
I also need a stranger.

1087
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:34,167
Someone who doesn't know me.

1088
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,813
Or anyone in my business.

1089
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,619
Well uh...

1090
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,944
Maybe you need a new sport coat.

1091
00:54:45,007 --> 00:54:47,007
Sport coat?
-Yeah.

1092
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:51,710
I know a place where the tailoring
is exceptional. The material the best.

1093
00:54:52,648 --> 00:54:54,841
A place in Beverly Hills called Gizzi.

1094
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:58,369
Gizzi's from Victoria. They just opened
up. I know him real well.

1095
00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:00,869
His father and my father came
from the old country together.

1096
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,060
Gizzi.

1097
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,064
Absolutely reliable.

1098
00:55:04,144 --> 00:55:05,786
Satisfaction guaranteed.

1099
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:08,286
Just tell him I sent you.

1100
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:14,484
Thanks, Rocco.

1101
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,546
If you want something, come back
in an hour. The clerk's out to lunch.

1102
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,735
Are you Gizzi?
-Yeah.

1103
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,724
I'd like to talk to you about
a special job of tailoring.

1104
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:48,425
I don't do no special jobs.

1105
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,036
Everything here is plainly marked.

1106
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:53,947
If you like the price, buy it.
If you don't, go someplace else.

1107
00:55:54,913 --> 00:55:56,538
Even a friend of Rocco's?

1108
00:55:58,468 --> 00:55:59,760
Rocco, huh?

1109
00:56:04,387 --> 00:56:05,721
Nice goods.

1110
00:56:06,732 --> 00:56:08,732
You got a lot of nice merchandise here.

1111
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,131
The best.

1112
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,135
You like the way it fits?

1113
00:56:21,154 --> 00:56:22,763
Sure. Looks good to me.

1114
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:26,407
What's this special job, friend?

1115
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:32,487
Say...

1116
00:56:33,908 --> 00:56:35,663
No wonder your coats are so expensive.

1117
00:56:36,574 --> 00:56:37,971
Look what I found in the pocket.

1118
00:56:38,307 --> 00:56:39,778
Five thousand dollars.

1119
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:43,038
I like them better with
ten thousand in them.

1120
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,866
Then the customer is very satisfied.

1121
00:56:51,571 --> 00:56:53,571
Maybe I better try on another coat.

1122
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:07,191
Cold for you out here, Gail?
Why don't you get yourself a wrap?

1123
00:57:07,244 --> 00:57:08,557
I'm very comfortable, thanks.

1124
00:57:09,032 --> 00:57:11,032
We haven't all been together
for a long time, Mal.

1125
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:12,549
What gave you the idea tonight?

1126
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,672
I thought I'd better let
bygones be bygones.

1127
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:19,767
Besides I...

1128
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:21,196
I could use a little gin money.

1129
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,826
Smartening up huh, boy?

1130
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:24,644
That's more like it.

1131
00:57:24,683 --> 00:57:27,199
I'll still show you that I can
beat you at anything.

1132
00:57:27,249 --> 00:57:28,652
Well, I deal.

1133
00:57:30,984 --> 00:57:32,739
Just giving him a little break.

1134
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:45,225
Dollar a point?

1135
00:57:45,515 --> 00:57:47,515
Don't want to make it too tough on you.

1136
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:51,301
But even at a buck a point,
the way you play gin I could retire.

1137
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:54,696
So, I'll help you retire.

1138
00:57:55,196 --> 00:57:58,217
I could use a little luck, Gail.
Why don't you sit next to me?

1139
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Are you sure you want my advice?

1140
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:06,084
Sure, go ahead. With you kibitzing he's
a cinch to wind up buying me a new car.

1141
00:58:30,895 --> 00:58:34,218
If I draw another card like that,
I'll think something's crooked.

1142
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:35,862
You can count on it.

1143
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,628
I have to make a living some way.

1144
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,264
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1145
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:41,326
I'm very sorry.

1146
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:43,858
How clumsy can you be.
We better get some water on that.

1147
00:58:43,908 --> 00:58:45,039
No, it's nothing, Mal.

1148
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:47,182
No, come on, we'll fix it.

1149
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,554
Stay here.

1150
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:06,255
The first time it's ever happened to us.

1151
00:59:07,209 --> 00:59:08,801
To others, yes but...

1152
00:59:09,118 --> 00:59:10,304
Never to us.

1153
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,179
How did you make out with the police?

1154
00:59:12,487 --> 00:59:14,078
They sweated me for eight hours.

1155
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,751
When they found out I didn't
know anything, they had to let me go.

1156
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,745
They just told me not to leave town.

1157
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:20,795
They even questioned me.

1158
00:59:20,855 --> 00:59:22,554
That's bad. Very bad.

1159
00:59:22,817 --> 00:59:25,793
The public should never even be aware
that there is a wire service.

1160
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:28,293
Lucky you spilled that drink.

1161
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:30,601
I guess Gail was lucky too.

1162
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,101
Everyone but Larry.
-Yeah.

1163
00:59:33,354 --> 00:59:35,354
I guess you never know, do you?

1164
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:38,127
Still can't figure out who would want
to kill him though.

1165
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:40,691
Unless it was one of those bookies
he batted around.

1166
00:59:40,899 --> 00:59:43,889
I don't think so.
It was too carefully planned.

1167
00:59:44,955 --> 00:59:47,800
We still have our everyday problems.

1168
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:52,086
We'll all have a little talk. Real soon.

1169
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,156
Don't feel that everything
has just ended, my dear.

1170
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:58,107
If the police...

1171
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:00,817
Can't discover Larry's murderer,
we will.

1172
01:00:01,317 --> 01:00:02,650
And when we do,

1173
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,582
there'll be another funeral.

1174
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,306
Are you sure you told me everything?

1175
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,652
I thought you were the girl who knew
all the answers.

1176
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:19,668
Please.

1177
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:21,830
I didn't have anything to do with it.

1178
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,387
You have to believe me.

1179
01:00:23,695 --> 01:00:25,044
Guess I have to.

1180
01:00:26,191 --> 01:00:27,544
I want to, Mal.

1181
01:00:42,994 --> 01:00:44,994
I have to get out of this house, Mal.

1182
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:47,862
Every minute is like waiting for it
to happen again.

1183
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,638
It won't happen again. Not to us.

1184
01:00:49,663 --> 01:00:51,125
I'll find you another place to live.

1185
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,902
Maybe you ought to go
to Palm Springs for a while.

1186
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,940
I want to get away from
the whole business, Mal.

1187
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,697
Not just the house, everything.

1188
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:58,821
I just want to be with you.
-You'll be with me.

1189
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,020
But I can't cut away now.

1190
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:04,149
They still owe me plenty
from that 70-30 chiseling.

1191
01:01:04,614 --> 01:01:07,447
Six months is all I need to make those
 guys pony up every cent they owe me.

1192
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:09,430
And when you get that, you'll want more.

1193
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:10,719
Another six months, another year.

1194
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:12,752
But I'd be a sucker to walk out now.

1195
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,170
Money's the answer to everything.

1196
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:15,914
Is it?
-Sure.

1197
01:01:18,944 --> 01:01:20,099
Hello, Trudy.

1198
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,302
Chippie said you wanted to see me.

1199
01:01:25,346 --> 01:01:26,973
That's right. You haven't been
around much lately.

1200
01:01:27,023 --> 01:01:28,022
Anything wrong?

1201
01:01:28,204 --> 01:01:29,449
No, not with me.

1202
01:01:29,577 --> 01:01:31,111
Nothing wrong with the business either.

1203
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:32,491
I'm declaring a dividend.

1204
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:34,662
No thanks, Mal, I don't want
any part of it.

1205
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:40,893
Is that why you haven't dragged down
your last couple of week's salary?

1206
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:41,918
That's why.

1207
01:01:41,968 --> 01:01:43,465
What for? It's money, isn't it?

1208
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,126
This money has a peculiar smell to it.

1209
01:01:46,176 --> 01:01:47,322
One I don't like.

1210
01:01:47,822 --> 01:01:49,822
Looks like things have changed,Trudy?

1211
01:01:49,857 --> 01:01:51,181
That's right, Mal, things have changed.

1212
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:53,680
Some of the changes,
I'm not so crazy about either.

1213
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,125
Maybe it's just some of the people.

1214
01:01:55,604 --> 01:01:58,808
You're not nailed to the job.
You can quit any time you like.

1215
01:01:59,073 --> 01:02:01,073
That's what I was thinking.
How do you resign around here?

1216
01:02:01,123 --> 01:02:03,123
I'll save you the trouble. You're fired.

1217
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,432
Any more questions?

1218
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,599
No, I guess you've answered
everything, Mal.

1219
01:02:12,724 --> 01:02:13,677
Good.

1220
01:02:21,547 --> 01:02:23,547
Mal Granger in?
-Who wants him?

1221
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:26,899
Just tell him the man who sold him
the suit. That's all you have to say.

1222
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:28,394
He's pretty busy. What do you want?

1223
01:02:28,684 --> 01:02:31,531
Like I said. Just tell him the man
who sold him the suit.

1224
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,301
All right, wait here.

1225
01:02:48,439 --> 01:02:50,257
OK, he'll see you.

1226
01:02:57,901 --> 01:03:00,360
How are you, Mal?
You're kind of a tough guy to see.

1227
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,944
Must be pretty busy these days.

1228
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,544
No busier than usual.
What's on your mind?

1229
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:06,606
It's like this...

1230
01:03:06,914 --> 01:03:09,696
A man always likes to hear a good word
about his work.

1231
01:03:10,552 --> 01:03:13,526
That job I did for you
turned out pretty good, huh?

1232
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:16,295
Everybody says
you're a real big shot now.

1233
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:18,795
A big wheel in the syndicate.

1234
01:03:19,094 --> 01:03:20,164
So?

1235
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,260
So I figure a big wheel
has gotta go out more.

1236
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:26,408
If you are, you gotta dress up.

1237
01:03:27,118 --> 01:03:29,392
Maybe you need some more suits, huh?

1238
01:03:30,123 --> 01:03:31,729
I got all the clothes
I can use right now.

1239
01:03:31,762 --> 01:03:33,762
Say you put up 25 G's.

1240
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:34,973
For a new wardrobe.

1241
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:36,711
Then you'd look good
no matter what comes up.

1242
01:03:37,656 --> 01:03:39,656
I can't afford it. It's too expensive.

1243
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,900
It'd be a good buy.

1244
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,273
I might take a trip back 

1245
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:46,078
to the old country for 3 or 4 months
to see my relatives.

1246
01:03:54,437 --> 01:03:56,940
It would be a good time
for me to take a trip.

1247
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,440
Good for you too.

1248
01:04:01,956 --> 01:04:03,467
Maybe you got a deal, Gizzi.

1249
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:04,821
If you leave right away.

1250
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:07,047
I'll have it for you tonight.

1251
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:09,684
We better meet somewhere
where we won't be seen.

1252
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:11,766
How about the Malibu pier at 10 O'clock?

1253
01:04:11,816 --> 01:04:13,053
Malibu pier.

1254
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,714
10 O'clock.

1255
01:04:23,662 --> 01:04:25,662
Hello.

1256
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,162
Hello, Carl, how are you?

1257
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:29,611
Tonight?

1258
01:04:31,216 --> 01:04:33,216
Do we have to have a meeting tonight?

1259
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,483
All right, if you say so.

1260
01:04:37,439 --> 01:04:38,983
Dinner at 8:30.

1261
01:04:48,123 --> 01:04:51,025
I'm glad you were able to
spare us the time, Mal.

1262
01:04:51,242 --> 01:04:52,511
Yeah, sure.

1263
01:04:54,073 --> 01:04:56,986
This meeting concerns you
perhaps more than it does us.

1264
01:04:57,036 --> 01:04:58,343
What's it all about anyway?

1265
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,491
Larry's death.

1266
01:05:02,767 --> 01:05:06,775
We have decided that for you at least
it has come at an opportune time.

1267
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:10,432
We're going to put you in charge
of the entire west coast.

1268
01:05:10,932 --> 01:05:12,079
Oh, that's fine.

1269
01:05:12,597 --> 01:05:14,216
But maybe I'm not quite ready yet.

1270
01:05:14,266 --> 01:05:15,617
I've still got a lot to learn.

1271
01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:16,990
Remember me?

1272
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:20,099
The country boy that got sucked
into a 70-30 deal?

1273
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:22,132
We told you that was necessary expenses.

1274
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:23,773
You got nothing to kick about.

1275
01:05:23,821 --> 01:05:25,821
You'll be getting a part of
Larry's take from now on.

1276
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:31,277
The big problem on this coast is to
take care of Larry's murderer.

1277
01:05:32,212 --> 01:05:34,851
As long as the assassin is free,

1278
01:05:35,114 --> 01:05:37,114
others might get ideas about us.

1279
01:05:37,495 --> 01:05:39,322
Maybe we ought to let
the police handle it.

1280
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,420
They at least have got some leads.

1281
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,067
It would have a more salutary effect
if we took care of it ourselves.

1282
01:05:45,786 --> 01:05:48,145
And I mean to do just that.

1283
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:52,088
What we must decide tonight...

1284
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,215
Is where to start.

1285
01:05:54,782 --> 01:05:57,845
Larry's murder was obviously
one of revenge.

1286
01:05:57,878 --> 01:05:59,007
Did you make out that list?

1287
01:05:59,057 --> 01:06:01,057
We had a little trouble
around Kansas City.

1288
01:06:01,376 --> 01:06:03,119
Kelly and Rasta both swore to get him.

1289
01:06:04,284 --> 01:06:05,409
But they didn't.

1290
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,471
I've already checked there.

1291
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:09,651
Kelly has been in the hospital
for months.

1292
01:06:10,315 --> 01:06:11,563
And Rasta

1293
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,145
was in Kansas City
the night Larry was killed.

1294
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:17,476
Maybe it was someone from out here.

1295
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:19,236
Somebody he crossed.

1296
01:06:20,266 --> 01:06:21,391
It was.

1297
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,340
I'm sure of that.

1298
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,214
But none of these local bookmakers would

1299
01:06:26,285 --> 01:06:28,714
dare to attempt such a rubout.

1300
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:33,347
Unless, of course, they hired
someone to do it.

1301
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:35,509
And probably someone from out of town.

1302
01:06:35,918 --> 01:06:38,402
There's one guy in L.A.
who might handle a job like this.

1303
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:40,902
I knew him back in Detroit.
 His name's Gizzi.

1304
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:45,727
Surely there must be more than one
suspect in a town of this size.

1305
01:06:46,538 --> 01:06:49,492
I think we better call
all the hoodlums in.

1306
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:52,558
What do you think, Mal?
-Yeah, sure.

1307
01:06:52,787 --> 01:06:53,660
Good idea.

1308
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:54,759
I'll take care of it.

1309
01:06:54,903 --> 01:06:55,641
Good.

1310
01:06:55,848 --> 01:06:58,452
Then we'll start with Mr. Gizzi and

1311
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:59,861
go on from there.

1312
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:03,753
Sorry to have taken up so much
of your time, Mal, but

1313
01:07:04,564 --> 01:07:07,661
I hope you realize
that this business is urgent.

1314
01:07:08,003 --> 01:07:09,063
Oh, sure.

1315
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:11,755
Good night.

1316
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,141
Good night.

1317
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:20,627
Good night.
-See you.

1318
01:07:54,634 --> 01:07:56,423
Thee you are, Gizzi.

1319
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,789
And take my advice.

1320
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:00,492
Make this a nice long trip.

1321
01:08:03,305 --> 01:08:04,517
Think I should?

1322
01:08:06,652 --> 01:08:09,075
I got to worrying
after I left you today.

1323
01:08:10,107 --> 01:08:12,006
What happens
if somebody puts the heat on you?

1324
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:13,820
Who's gonna protect you then?
-I will.

1325
01:08:13,863 --> 01:08:15,644
You just go and visit your relatives.

1326
01:08:15,683 --> 01:08:17,683
Believe me, you need this trip.

1327
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:20,705
I waited a long time.
I can wait a little longer.

1328
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,966
Particularly now I got my eye
on a new business.

1329
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,129
Oh, not mine.

1330
01:08:25,595 --> 01:08:27,595
Yours.
-I'll handle it myself.

1331
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:28,904
I don't need you, Gizzi.

1332
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:30,268
I say you do.

1333
01:08:30,705 --> 01:08:32,327
Just a silent partner.

1334
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,862
Somebody to look after your interests
while you

1335
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,313
chase around with that dame of Mason's.

1336
01:08:36,341 --> 01:08:37,433
you leave her out of this.

1337
01:08:37,483 --> 01:08:39,804
After all she's pretty and young.

1338
01:08:40,091 --> 01:08:43,058
She might get into all kind of trouble
if you don't keep her happy.

1339
01:08:43,091 --> 01:08:44,507
I tell you, leave her out of this.

1340
01:08:44,557 --> 01:08:45,563
Stubborn, huh?

1341
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:49,331
You can't afford to argue, Mal,
you're cutting me in.

1342
01:08:49,468 --> 01:08:51,468
I'd have to figure out
how to cut you in.

1343
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:52,838
And while I was figuring it,

1344
01:08:53,185 --> 01:08:54,894
a lot of things might happen.

1345
01:08:54,944 --> 01:08:57,218
A lot more will happen
if you don't cut me in.

1346
01:08:57,955 --> 01:09:01,029
I'll give you till tomorrow
to make up your mind.

1347
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:06,853
I get kind of nervous
when people keep me waiting.

1348
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:14,814
I'll be seeing you, partner.

1349
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,255
You look sick.

1350
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,755
Get me a drink.

1351
01:09:55,255 --> 01:09:57,255
Am I glad you're home.

1352
01:09:57,335 --> 01:09:59,490
I tried all over town to catch you.

1353
01:10:00,858 --> 01:10:02,858
That cop wants you to call him.

1354
01:10:03,778 --> 01:10:05,778
Pete Wright?
-Yeah.

1355
01:10:05,922 --> 01:10:07,922
He wants to talk to you tonight.

1356
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:13,612
What does he want?
Where did you tell him I was?

1357
01:10:13,662 --> 01:10:15,203
I just said you would call him. Period.

1358
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:19,357
I tried to stall him. Told him I thought
you went to Palm Springs to see Gail.

1359
01:10:28,572 --> 01:10:30,346
I'd call him right now if I were you.

1360
01:10:30,396 --> 01:10:32,396
You don't want him coming here
to pick you up.

1361
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:05,374
Long distance?

1362
01:11:05,424 --> 01:11:08,490
I want Palm Springs 23654.

1363
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,257
Hello.
-Hello, Gail?

1364
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:19,307
Oh, Mal, I've been hoping you'd call.

1365
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:22,236
Is anything wrong?

1366
01:11:22,309 --> 01:11:23,780
I'll tell you about it when I see yo.

1367
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:25,606
But you got to do something
for me right away.

1368
01:11:25,642 --> 01:11:28,254
You know that relay amplifier
I rigged up when I was down there?

1369
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:30,271
That thing I used to keep in touch
with all the offices?

1370
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:31,656
It's still here but...

1371
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:32,884
What's all this about?

1372
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:35,529
Is it Carl?
-Not yet.

1373
01:11:35,657 --> 01:11:38,354
But unless you do exactly as I tell you,
I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.

1374
01:11:38,404 --> 01:11:39,313
Go ahead, Mal.

1375
01:11:39,614 --> 01:11:40,917
Pick up the other phone.

1376
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:44,971
And call Pete Wright of the gangster
squad in Los Angeles.

1377
01:11:45,019 --> 01:11:48,266
When you get him, put each phone
in the cradles of the amplifier.

1378
01:11:48,316 --> 01:11:49,288
You understand that?

1379
01:11:49,712 --> 01:11:50,784
OK. Call him.

1380
01:11:59,892 --> 01:12:01,166
OK, Mal.

1381
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:10,278
Hello, operator.

1382
01:12:10,586 --> 01:12:14,041
I want to call Los Angeles.
Michigan 5211, please.

1383
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,436
Lieutenant Wright please.
Palm Springs calling.

1384
01:12:23,053 --> 01:12:24,826
Gangster squad, Wright speaking.

1385
01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:27,845
Lieutenant Wright, this is Gail Mason.

1386
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:30,345
Just a moment. Mal wants to talk to you.

1387
01:12:30,845 --> 01:12:32,845
Put the beeper on. I want this recorded.

1388
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:40,834
<i>Hello, Granger?

1389
01:12:41,027 --> 01:12:43,580
<i>What are you doing in Palm Springs?
You were told not to leave town.

1390
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,068
<i>That's what I'm calling you about.

1391
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,424
Gail needed a rest pretty badly
and I thought

1392
01:12:47,441 --> 01:12:49,125
I thought I could
use some sun myself so uh..

1393
01:12:49,175 --> 01:12:51,330
We decided to run down here on our own.

1394
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,250
I thought you'd be celebrating.

1395
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,300
Word's around town
you just had a promotion.

1396
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:58,888
How does it feel
having Larry Mason's old job?

1397
01:12:59,151 --> 01:13:00,455
You know a lot, don't you?

1398
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:04,064
<i>I like to keep tabs on a guy who's
going up in the world so rapidly.

1399
01:13:04,265 --> 01:13:05,167
<i>Thanks.

1400
01:13:05,196 --> 01:13:05,985
Don't mention it.

1401
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:07,662
Better stay put, Granger. That's all.

1402
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:11,195
I just wanted him on the record
about taking over the west coast.

1403
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:12,214
Well, we got it.

1404
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:14,594
It may come in handy
if we ever go before the grand jury.

1406
01:13:18,206 --> 01:13:20,754
This coroner's report
doesn't add up at all.

1407
01:13:20,889 --> 01:13:24,184
According to him, Gizzi was crushed to
death before he was dumped in the ocean.

1408
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,549
No water in his lungs.

1409
01:13:26,049 --> 01:13:28,049
The crime lab report isn't in yet.

1410
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:30,531
Sounds like just another wrong guy
rubbed out.

1411
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:31,937
But it wasn't a gang job.

1412
01:13:32,019 --> 01:13:33,588
It doesn't have
the right characteristics.

1413
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:34,844
He had money on him.

1414
01:13:34,874 --> 01:13:36,661
So robbery's out.

1415
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:38,215
I think it was done
on the spur of the moment.

1416
01:13:38,265 --> 01:13:39,565
I can't get it.

1417
01:13:40,402 --> 01:13:41,474
What's the matter?

1418
01:13:41,524 --> 01:13:43,166
If it's not Bing Crosby,
you don't like it?

1419
01:13:43,237 --> 01:13:46,144
It's that one you ran on Granger.
I can't get part of it.

1420
01:13:46,236 --> 01:13:48,658
A whistle keeps drowning out
something he's saying.

1421
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:50,334
Let me hear it.
Maybe I can figure it out.

1422
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:51,646
Right here.

1423
01:13:52,274 --> 01:13:54,274
<i>Gail needed a rest pretty badly and I

1424
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,400
<i>so uh...

1425
01:13:56,462 --> 01:13:58,462
<i>decided to run down here on our own.

1426
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,880
That's some kind of a streetcar whistle.

1427
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:02,970
Whatever it is they don't have
any transportation running 

1428
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,332
right through the center
of Palm Springs.

1429
01:14:05,628 --> 01:14:07,628
<i>you know a lot,don't you?

1430
01:14:07,717 --> 01:14:09,717
Granger wasn't there at all.

1431
01:14:09,961 --> 01:14:12,762
Why did he go to so much trouble
to rig up an alibi?

1432
01:14:13,681 --> 01:14:15,280
We better have a talk with him.

1433

1434
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:33,237
Mal.

1435
01:14:34,449 --> 01:14:36,961
This happened right about the time
you talked to me.

1436
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:38,685
Well?

1437
01:14:40,504 --> 01:14:42,504
Did your alibi have anything to do
with this?

1438
01:14:42,554 --> 01:14:45,018
You've been around long enough
not to ask questions like that.

1439
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:47,582
Who was he, Mal?

1440
01:14:47,762 --> 01:14:48,942
How do I know?

1441
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:51,880
Was he the one who shot Larry?

1442
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,808
You hired him to kill Larry
then you had to kill him.

1443
01:14:57,917 --> 01:14:59,071
I never thought that you'd...

1444
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:00,751
That I'd what?

1445
01:15:01,643 --> 01:15:03,643
Murder.
-Don't say that. I don't like it!

1446
01:15:17,611 --> 01:15:19,311
That's what Larry would have done.

1447
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,846
I'm sorry. It will never
happen again. I promise you.

1448
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:29,410
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

1449
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:31,964
Nothing's going to happen to me.

1450
01:15:53,264 --> 01:15:54,318
Hello?

1451
01:15:54,848 --> 01:15:56,188
Oh, hello, Wright.

1452
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,852
Yeah, sure, I'm still down here.

1453
01:16:01,297 --> 01:16:03,069
What's all the rush about?

1454
01:16:06,406 --> 01:16:07,450
All right.

1455
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,950
See you at headquarters at 3 O'clock.

1456
01:16:11,992 --> 01:16:13,738
What do you mean you don't know
what that whistle is?

1457
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:15,526
Take another look, Granger.

1458
01:16:15,734 --> 01:16:18,259
This is a recording
of a streetcar whistle.

1459
01:16:18,348 --> 01:16:22,034
This is a recording of your phone call.

1460
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:25,997
Identical sounds. Streetcar whistles.

1461
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:29,140
There are no streetcars in Palm Springs.

1462
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,640
I still don't know what
you're so excited about.

1463
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:33,684
I've been around electronics.

1464
01:16:33,734 --> 01:16:35,734
You could have butched up
that recording yourself.

1465
01:16:35,978 --> 01:16:39,084
It might have been a streetcar from
around here. They do go past here.

1466
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,678
You think of everything, don't you?

1467
01:16:40,867 --> 01:16:42,867
But you were framing
an alibi that night.

1468
01:16:43,075 --> 01:16:44,688
That cathode ray proves it.

1469
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,377
Why would I need an alibi?

1470
01:16:46,427 --> 01:16:47,350
You tell us.

1471
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,154
A lot of things happened that night.

1472
01:16:49,207 --> 01:16:50,722
But only one would interest you.

1473
01:16:51,042 --> 01:16:52,353
A guy named Gizzi.

1474
01:16:52,381 --> 01:16:53,756
The guy went off the pier.

1475
01:16:53,797 --> 01:16:55,009
I never even heard of him.

1476
01:16:55,059 --> 01:16:58,006
If you guys are going to drag me down
here every time you get a brainstorm.

1477
01:16:58,059 --> 01:16:58,926
We are.

1478
01:16:59,189 --> 01:17:01,965
And one of those brainstorms is going
to get you in trouble, big shot.

1479
01:17:02,365 --> 01:17:04,869
I have a hunch you got my message
at the beach all right.

1480
01:17:05,195 --> 01:17:08,101
But you didn't call Palm Springs from
your house. You're too smart for that.

1481
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,256
You probably went to the drug store
and called Mrs. Mason 

1482
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:12,023
and had her hook up your call.

1483
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,513
You've heard of relay amplifiers,
haven't you?

1484
01:17:14,693 --> 01:17:16,162
Maybe I have and maybe I haven't.

1485
01:17:16,452 --> 01:17:20,015
I'm tired of playing games
over some stupid train whistle.

1486
01:17:20,122 --> 01:17:22,953
Either book me, let me call my lawyer,
or let me get out of here.

1487
01:17:23,453 --> 01:17:25,131
OK, Granger, you can beat it.

1488
01:17:25,222 --> 01:17:26,211
Thanks.

1489
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:28,200
The next time I bring you in,
it's to stay.

1490
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:30,300
So don't get any ideas
about leaving town.

1491
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,350
What makes you think
there's going to be a next time?

1492
01:17:36,311 --> 01:17:38,680
Don't worry, we'll be ready
in five minutes.

1493
01:17:40,559 --> 01:17:42,194
That's not what I'm worried about.

1494
01:17:42,904 --> 01:17:45,271
There's nothing the matter, is there?
 You're going with me?

1495
01:17:46,445 --> 01:17:47,634
Of course I am.

1496
01:17:47,851 --> 01:17:49,851
All right, you wanted to get away.
Now you're doing it.

1497
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:53,100
Look.

1498
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,385
You know I wouldn't let anything happen
to you. I got everything figured out.

1499
01:17:57,885 --> 01:17:59,885
If it were only the police,
we'd have a chance.

1500
01:18:00,257 --> 01:18:01,369
But there's Carl.

1501
01:18:02,097 --> 01:18:04,686
I've seen too many try it but I've
never seen anyone make it.

1502
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:06,985
Come here, let me show you something.

1503
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:14,254
There's $230,000 in cash.

1504
01:18:14,462 --> 01:18:16,462
I didn't get that by being stupid.

1505
01:18:16,715 --> 01:18:19,126
And I know where I got about
that much more waiting.

1506
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:21,489
And I'll tell you where
we're going to get it.

1507
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:22,865
We're going to Las Vegas.

1508
01:18:22,915 --> 01:18:24,030
You, me and Chippie.

1509
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:26,030
Las Vegas?

1510
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,530
That's the last place Carl will figure.

1511
01:18:30,893 --> 01:18:34,306
This is one time I make those guys
pay off every cent they owe me.

1512
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:39,117
<i>While I was still trying to hook up
Granger with Gizzi's murder in L.A.,

1513
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:41,270
<i>he was fixing things for a real haul.

1514
01:18:41,414 --> 01:18:42,912
<i>It was a dangerous plan.

1515
01:18:43,065 --> 01:18:45,065
<i>But by now, Mal was too driven to care.

1516
01:18:45,531 --> 01:18:48,177
<i>Mal knew which books the syndicate
owned in las Vegas.

1517
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:50,065
<i>And he was going to past post them.

1518
01:18:50,565 --> 01:18:53,637
<i>If he was caught,
he was dead right then.

1519
01:18:53,836 --> 01:18:57,688
<i>He tapped the cables of the wire service
that led to all the horse parlors.

1520
01:18:57,887 --> 01:19:00,684
<i>And electrically set their clocks
back two minutes.

1521
01:19:01,385 --> 01:19:03,385
<i>Then he stretched wires
into a hotel room.

1522
01:19:03,885 --> 01:19:06,683
<i>Between the connections
were tape recording machines.

1523
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:10,781
<i>By next afternoon, Granger was
all set for the kill.

1524
01:19:11,712 --> 01:19:12,747
How do I look?

1525
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:14,771
Hope I look better than I feel,
'cause I don't feel so good.

1526
01:19:14,821 --> 01:19:16,492
You look fine, Chippie.
Now, you got it straight?

1527
01:19:16,555 --> 01:19:18,966
Your station is at the horse parlor
across the way.

1528
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,191
When I get the winner,

1529
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:22,529
I'll cut in on the loudspeaker
with the late price change.

1530
01:19:22,572 --> 01:19:24,361
I'll use a phony voice like this.

1531
01:19:24,395 --> 01:19:27,238
Flash. The odds on number three
in the seventh

1532
01:19:27,288 --> 01:19:29,509
race are now 8 to 1.
-Hey, that's good.

1533
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:32,019
Now the number of the horse
I call is the winner.

1534
01:19:32,337 --> 01:19:34,850
And I'm going to sock $3,000 across the
board on number 7 in the eighth race.

1535
01:19:34,888 --> 01:19:38,456
No, the seventh race. Number 3
in the seventh race.

1536
01:19:38,483 --> 01:19:40,206
Mal, what if I get it wrong?
-Don't worry, Chippie.

1537
01:19:40,228 --> 01:19:42,513
It'll be the last time you ever get
anything wrong in your life.

1538
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:44,021
I hope so.
-Now remember.

1539
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,045
It's just the number of the horse I call

1540
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:48,543
and the seventh and eighth
races in California but

1541
01:19:48,557 --> 01:19:50,557
you gotta make a couple of
sucker bets first.

1542
01:19:50,572 --> 01:19:53,000
If I want to pick a loser, I'll pick
a winner. It's just my luck.

1543
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:55,112
No, we got to build up
a couple of losses

1544
01:19:55,131 --> 01:19:56,618
so they won't think anything about it

1545
01:19:56,668 --> 01:19:58,357
when we really start to
chunk it in later.

1546
01:19:59,616 --> 01:20:00,804
OK, get going.

1547
01:20:00,854 --> 01:20:02,854
I've already told Gail what to do.

1548
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,893
In the third in California

1549
01:20:06,047 --> 01:20:08,393
Make the show horse $2.60

1550
01:20:08,455 --> 01:20:09,876
instead of $2.80.

1551
01:20:09,995 --> 01:20:12,766
They're nearing the post
for the seventh in California.

1552
01:20:12,816 --> 01:20:14,088
Here's the reading.

1553
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:16,232
Here are the readings.

1554
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:18,458
Even money on top.

1555
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,958
20, 4

1556
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:22,180
20

1557
01:20:22,306 --> 01:20:23,698
scratch one.

1558
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,760
10, 6

1559
01:20:26,023 --> 01:20:28,023
2 1/2 and 8 on the bottom.

1560
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,998
<i>Granger was now ready.

1561
01:20:31,297 --> 01:20:34,364
<i>He was recording the running of the race
on one tape recorder.

1562
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:37,191
<i>And holding up the recorded results
for two minutes.

1563
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:41,155
<i>On the other machine he was releasing
the delayed results to the horse parlors

1564
01:20:41,655 --> 01:20:44,279
They're off and running in the seventh
in California.

1565
01:20:44,889 --> 01:20:47,430
At the quarter it's number 8 by a neck.

1566
01:20:47,601 --> 01:20:49,601
Number 6 by a head.

1567
01:20:49,772 --> 01:20:51,184
And number 2.

1568
01:20:52,926 --> 01:20:56,227
They're still at the post
in the seventh at California.

1569
01:20:56,325 --> 01:21:01,248
They're still at the post in the seventh
at California. Number 3 is acting up.

1570
01:21:10,613 --> 01:21:12,302
Nothing to it.

1571
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:14,473
In the stretch,

1572
01:21:14,553 --> 01:21:16,553
It's number 2 by a length,

1573
01:21:16,615 --> 01:21:18,396
number 6 by a head,

1574
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:20,862
and number 8 is running third.

1575
01:21:20,912 --> 01:21:22,912
Here are the winners at California,

1576
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:26,154
Number 2 wins it by three lengths.

1577
01:21:27,397 --> 01:21:28,711
They're still at the post.

1578
01:21:29,068 --> 01:21:30,402
Here comes a flash.

1579
01:21:30,902 --> 01:21:32,355
Here comes a flash.

1580
01:21:32,866 --> 01:21:34,152
Number 2

1581
01:21:34,524 --> 01:21:37,043
Number 2 is now 15

1582
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:39,791
Number 2 is now 15

1583
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,863
Two thousand across the board
on number 2 please.

1584
01:21:42,913 --> 01:21:43,980
Yes, ma'am.

1585
01:21:46,106 --> 01:21:48,446
Three thousand across the board
on number 2.

1586
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,544
Just a minute. Al?

1587
01:21:51,722 --> 01:21:54,723
This fellow wants to bet $3,000
across the board on number 2.

1588
01:21:54,773 --> 01:21:56,773
They're not off yet in California.

1589
01:21:56,862 --> 01:21:58,185
Number 2

1590
01:21:58,274 --> 01:21:59,659
Is back to 20.

1591
01:21:59,851 --> 01:22:01,851
He's already lost $8,000.

1592
01:22:01,901 --> 01:22:03,142
Guess he's trying to get even.

1593
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,370
Take it. They're still at the post.

1594
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,480
OK.

1595
01:22:10,606 --> 01:22:13,435
They're off and running
in the seventh at California.

1596
01:22:13,497 --> 01:22:16,361
At the quarter it's number 8 by a neck,

1597
01:22:16,477 --> 01:22:18,103
Number 6 by a head,

1598
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:19,649
And number 2.

1599
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,968
At the half it's number 6
by a half a length,

1600
01:22:23,221 --> 01:22:25,221
Number 2 by a head,.

1601
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:26,578
and number 8.

1602
01:22:26,834 --> 01:22:28,476
In the stretch,

1603
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:30,526
It's number 2 by a length,

1604
01:22:30,588 --> 01:22:32,297
number 6 by a head,

1605
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:34,571
and number 8 is running third.

1606
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:36,621
Here are the winners at California,

1607
01:22:36,966 --> 01:22:39,406
Number 2 wins it by three lengths.

1608
01:22:39,577 --> 01:22:41,577
Number 6 is second.

1609
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:43,657
And number 8 is third.

1610
01:22:45,846 --> 01:22:48,647
It's OK in California in the eighth.

1611
01:22:48,828 --> 01:22:51,147
That's number 9 Milargo,

1612
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:53,391
number 1 Zapata,

1613
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:55,638
and number 3 Thirador.

1614
01:22:55,688 --> 01:22:57,944
That's 9, 1, and 3.

1615
01:22:58,983 --> 01:23:00,983
Pardon me.

1616
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,215
You hit us pretty hard.

1617
01:23:12,478 --> 01:23:14,669
I'm afraid we haven't got this kind
of money on hand.

1618
01:23:14,955 --> 01:23:16,908
Would you mind taking a check?
You can cash it 

1619
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,735
at the bank when it opens
in the morning.

1620
01:23:19,263 --> 01:23:20,918
I guess it'll be all right.

1621
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:22,796
I'll get it right away.

1622
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:26,326
Here you are, Chippie.
The hotel paid Gail off in cash.

1623
01:23:26,359 --> 01:23:27,874
Did you get rid of those
lines on the roof?

1624
01:23:27,912 --> 01:23:30,205
You wouldn't know anybody was up
there. Not even a cigarette butt on it.

1625
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:33,250
All we got to do is cash Chippie's check
in the morning and then, darling...

1626
01:23:33,628 --> 01:23:34,588
We're retired.

1627
01:23:34,805 --> 01:23:35,996
I'm afraid.

1628
01:23:36,462 --> 01:23:38,462
Between the police and Carl.
-It's all over.

1629
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:39,973
We're going to sink without a trace.

1630
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:42,507
We just lie low at the Boulder Inn
for a couple of weeks and then

1631
01:23:42,609 --> 01:23:43,775
we're off to Guatemala.

1632
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:45,269
Maybe you will but how about me?

1633
01:23:45,299 --> 01:23:47,479
If they start looking,
Vegas will give them all the answers.

1634
01:23:47,497 --> 01:23:48,436
Let's not borrow trouble.

1635
01:23:48,444 --> 01:23:50,857
There's only one road out. If they
check the railroads and the airlines...

1636
01:23:50,907 --> 01:23:51,719
Chippie...

1637
01:23:51,784 --> 01:23:54,466
Just in case of a tie,
I got a place all picked out.

1638
01:23:54,966 --> 01:23:56,966
That's him all right.

1639
01:23:57,019 --> 01:23:58,627
He didn't say his name was Granger.

1640
01:23:59,127 --> 01:24:01,630
He brought in a Cadillac
with a marked up fender.

1641
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,130
I rubbed it down and airbrushed it
while he waited.

1642
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:05,677
Made it look good as new.

1643
01:24:05,752 --> 01:24:08,170
And the paint was identical with
the sample we showed you?

1644
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,199
Yeah, Cadillac green.

1645
01:24:10,235 --> 01:24:12,235
Thanks. That's all we need.

1646
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:13,284
Let's pick up Granger.

1647
01:24:13,355 --> 01:24:15,848
Nobody else has been able to tell me
how my books

1648
01:24:15,898 --> 01:24:18,653
 were hit for a quarter of a million
dollars in one day, Healy.

1649
01:24:19,171 --> 01:24:21,171
What makes you think you can?
-Nothing maybe.

1650
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:24,108
But the day it happened, I saw
Chippie Evans cashing a wad.

1651
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,131
And Mal Granger was in town too.

1652
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:27,152
I saw him.

1653
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,072
Go on.

1654
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:29,848
I just figured they went down
for the weekend.

1655
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,062
When I heard what happened...

1656
01:24:31,546 --> 01:24:33,052
You'll figure it out for yourself.

1657
01:24:33,214 --> 01:24:35,214
Now it adds up.

1658
01:24:35,358 --> 01:24:38,856
Only one man in the world would know
how to past post up here.

1659
01:24:39,055 --> 01:24:40,650
Mal Granger.

1660
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:43,587
Now I'm sure of a lot of things.

1661
01:24:43,806 --> 01:24:45,054
Larry's death.

1662
01:24:45,104 --> 01:24:46,409
Mrs. Mason was with him.

1663
01:24:47,263 --> 01:24:48,909
You've done us a favor, Healy.

1664
01:24:49,101 --> 01:24:50,845
When I get back to L.A.,

1665
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:53,070
I'll see that you're set up
with a new book.

1666
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,072
Thanks.

1667
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:57,606
If you could just tell us
where Granger is staying.

1668
01:24:57,656 --> 01:24:58,864
He's not here now.

1669
01:24:59,236 --> 01:25:01,889
He wouldn't take a chance on getting
cut off in a place like this.

1670
01:25:02,389 --> 01:25:05,030
That's why you'll never be anything
but a bookmaker, Healy.

1671
01:25:05,925 --> 01:25:07,925
Mal Granger's too smart to run.

1672
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:11,431
He'd stay right here expecting us
to be searching the country for him.

1673
01:25:11,636 --> 01:25:13,327
We heard about an hour ago
that the police

1674
01:25:13,377 --> 01:25:16,975
were down at his place in Malibu
looking for him for Gizzi's murder.

1675
01:25:17,328 --> 01:25:20,743
Operator, will you get me
the L.A. police department.

1676
01:25:21,672 --> 01:25:25,509
I want to talk to Lieutenant Pete Wright
of the gangster squad.

1677
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:40,662
Guatemala here we come. Nothing in the
papers about us. We're in the clear.

1678
01:25:41,216 --> 01:25:42,763
How are you darling? You still love me?

1679
01:25:42,796 --> 01:25:44,961
I'll love you more in Guatemala.
-That's my girl.

1680
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:45,700
Come on, Chippie.

1681
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,750
We got to go to Las Vegas
to get the check cashed.

1682
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:50,976
That's kind of taking chances, ain't it?

1683
01:25:51,009 --> 01:25:52,846
Not like trying to cash it
in another town 

1684
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:54,123
and waiting for the check to clear.

1685
01:25:54,156 --> 01:25:57,133
You get a cab out of here and go
straight to the bank in Las Vegas

1686
01:25:57,162 --> 01:25:58,752
and keep the cab waiting, see?
-Sure.

1687
01:25:58,802 --> 01:25:59,920
All right, come on. Let's get going.

1688
01:26:00,298 --> 01:26:01,868
Come on, come on.

1689
01:26:13,144 --> 01:26:14,898
A hundred thousand dollars.

1690
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:17,398
Where's the rest of it, Evans?

1691
01:26:18,252 --> 01:26:19,569
I don't know.

1692
01:26:30,795 --> 01:26:31,958
Boulder Inn.

1693
01:26:32,795 --> 01:26:34,458
So that's where our little boyfriend is.

1694
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:36,246
Isn't it?

1695
01:26:36,296 --> 01:26:38,086
Stop it! You know I can't stand that.

1696
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:41,024
Besides that's...

1697
01:26:41,395 --> 01:26:42,951
Peterson's department.

1698
01:26:43,001 --> 01:26:44,431
I told you I don't know anything.

1699
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:46,931
He's at the inn all right.

1700
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:47,925
Should we get him?

1701
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:50,041
No, let him stay there for now.

1702
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:51,756
Our friends the police are out.

1703
01:26:51,919 --> 01:26:53,370
What are you going to do with me?

1704
01:26:54,957 --> 01:26:58,337
Evans, I admire loyalty
but not to the wrong people.

1705
01:26:58,654 --> 01:27:00,654
You will go with Peterson, please.

1706
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:15,812
You better get down to the airport.
You'll miss Lieutenant Wright.

1707
01:27:15,862 --> 01:27:17,616
You're the one who called him.
He'll be expecting you.

1708
01:27:17,961 --> 01:27:19,113
A policeman?

1709
01:27:19,613 --> 01:27:21,182
I wouldn't be bothered.

1710
01:27:21,983 --> 01:27:24,654
You take care of it.
I'll join you later.

1711
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,126
Hi, Pete.

1712
01:27:35,181 --> 01:27:37,364
What's that you called me?
-He meant Mr. Rush.

1713
01:27:37,406 --> 01:27:38,330
That's better.

1714
01:27:38,364 --> 01:27:39,174
Where's Stevens?

1715
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,997
You know how it is. He doesn't like to
get involved in anything unpleasant.

1716
01:27:42,031 --> 01:27:44,786
Oh, sure. He wants to keep
his lily white hands clean.

1717
01:27:44,815 --> 01:27:45,955
Sheriff Steele.

1718
01:27:45,987 --> 01:27:47,739
Howdy, sheriff. Always glad to
help an officer.

1719
01:27:47,789 --> 01:27:49,450
Why don't you stop marching?

1720
01:27:49,767 --> 01:27:51,088
And get this through your head.

1721
01:27:51,144 --> 01:27:53,943
The only reason I'm here cleaning up
your dirty laundry

1722
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:55,568
 is because we want Granger badly.

1723
01:27:55,618 --> 01:27:57,618
There's no reason for that attitude.

1724
01:27:57,753 --> 01:28:00,824
My attitude toward you
is one of complete disgust.

1725
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:03,905
We're clean. Our wire service
is perfectly legitimate.

1726
01:28:03,941 --> 01:28:05,941
So are your banks and music businesses.

1727
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:07,542
But what about all your sidelines?

1728
01:28:07,587 --> 01:28:08,765
You want me to go into them?

1729
01:28:08,796 --> 01:28:11,407
What's that got to do with Granger? You
came up here to get him, didn't you?

1730
01:28:11,457 --> 01:28:13,457
Sure. But someday,
we're going to get all of you.

1731
01:28:13,848 --> 01:28:16,112
When the public gets wise
to your stinking mess.

1732
01:28:16,329 --> 01:28:17,624
Now where's Granger?

1733
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:24,727
Boulder Inn.

1734
01:28:24,816 --> 01:28:26,816
We can be there in about
35 minutes. I've got a car waiting.

1735
01:28:35,313 --> 01:28:36,974
Well, that settles Granger.

1736
01:28:37,474 --> 01:28:39,474
I think we handled things very well.

1737
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:41,810
My bags here?
-Got them checked.

1738
01:28:41,872 --> 01:28:42,860
Good.

1739
01:28:43,177 --> 01:28:45,706
Steve, I'm putting you
in charge out here.

1740
01:28:46,535 --> 01:28:50,578
I promised my children I'd go back east
on the farm with them for a while.

1741
01:28:51,078 --> 01:28:54,538
Anything important I can be reached
through the usual source.

1742
01:29:05,081 --> 01:29:06,351
Mal?

1743
01:29:08,148 --> 01:29:09,801
Something's happened to Chippie.

1744
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:26,392
I think we better go find him.

1745
01:29:32,529 --> 01:29:34,431
The inn's about ten miles from here.

1746
01:29:34,693 --> 01:29:36,031
Not far from the dam.

1747
01:30:02,594 --> 01:30:04,352
That's Granger. Turn around.

1748
01:30:04,578 --> 01:30:05,985
Must be Wright.

1749
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,121
He's turning around.

1750
01:30:15,105 --> 01:30:17,105
We better head for Boulder Dam.

1751
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,860
Once we're across the dam,
we're in Arizona.

1752
01:30:25,922 --> 01:30:27,602
We'll never make it into Vegas now.

1753
01:30:33,111 --> 01:30:36,308
Car number 1 calling government
rangers at Boulder Dam.

1754
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:38,197
Green Cadillac convertible

1755
01:30:38,241 --> 01:30:40,590
California license number, 9 Young 8

1756
01:30:40,606 --> 01:30:42,606
9 Young 8 014

1757
01:30:42,656 --> 01:30:44,986
014 headed toward dam.

1758
01:30:45,078 --> 01:30:47,910
This man wanted for murder.
 Throw up roadblock. Over.

1759
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:21,606
Kelly, Bates you handle  the other side.
Get him if he tries to come over.

1760
01:31:21,656 --> 01:31:23,656
OK Hey what's the matter? It's a holdup.

1761
01:31:25,526 --> 01:31:27,526
Mal, it's too late.
They've blocked it off.

1762
01:31:33,959 --> 01:31:36,008
It's never too late, darling, come on.

1763
01:31:59,704 --> 01:32:04,861
The next tour of the dam
will leave in five minutes.

1764
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,614
The next tour of the dam

1765
01:32:31,932 --> 01:32:34,600
will leave immediately.

1766
01:32:39,337 --> 01:32:41,726
No smoking on the elevator.

1767
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:50,630
Wright, L.A. police.

1768
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:52,206
Their car's parked up there.

1769
01:32:52,277 --> 01:32:54,020
Did you see anyone
who fits his description?

1770
01:32:54,073 --> 01:32:55,516
No, I didn't see them.

1771
01:32:55,815 --> 01:32:57,815
The only way he could have got through
is in the crowd.

1772
01:32:57,913 --> 01:32:59,913
Want to come with us, captain,
we'll check the other end,.

1773
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:10,786
We're now descending
in the elevator 528 feet.

1774
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:16,916
One tenth of a mile or equal to the
height of a 44 story office building.

1775
01:33:17,416 --> 01:33:19,416
As we step from the elevator,

1776
01:33:19,605 --> 01:33:23,897
We still have 199 feet of it
down below us.

1777
01:33:28,372 --> 01:33:30,062
Kelly, have you seen Granger
and the girl?

1778
01:33:30,109 --> 01:33:31,504
Nope, no one's got through here.

1779
01:33:31,554 --> 01:33:33,554
They must have ducked into the dam.
-Let's check.

1780
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:38,644
Right this way, please.

1781
01:33:38,907 --> 01:33:41,144
Follow me. Watch your step.

1782
01:33:49,949 --> 01:33:51,779
At this point,

1783
01:33:51,941 --> 01:33:54,700
we're now standing
in a portion of the dam

1784
01:33:55,036 --> 01:33:57,680
that's 457 feet thick.

1785
01:33:58,618 --> 01:34:00,618
It's 107 feet

1786
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:04,194
upstream through solid concrete

1787
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:05,952
to the water in Lake Mead.

1788
01:34:06,151 --> 01:34:09,887
We're going to walk downstream
through the thickness of the dam,

1789
01:34:10,232 --> 01:34:13,377
350 feet to the Nevada wing
of the power plant.

1790
01:34:13,468 --> 01:34:15,468
Watch your step, please.

1791
01:34:15,518 --> 01:34:16,640
Follow me.

1792
01:34:19,462 --> 01:34:21,010
How long ago did the last tour come out?

1793
01:34:21,048 --> 01:34:23,377
About 5 minutes ago. They should be
coming out the other end now.

1794
01:34:23,427 --> 01:34:24,718
Let us use your binoculars.

1795
01:34:31,844 --> 01:34:36,738
You are now standing in the
Nevada wing of the power plant.

1796
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:42,878
Ahead are seven hydroelectric generators

1797
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,676
each one with a turbine capacity

1798
01:34:45,747 --> 01:34:48,639
115,000 horse power.

1799
01:34:48,728 --> 01:34:52,648
Don't worry, we'll get out of here as
soon as we get over to the Arizona side.

1800
01:34:52,737 --> 01:34:55,612
Now, right this way, please.

1801
01:34:55,719 --> 01:34:57,719
Follow me.

1802
01:35:24,263 --> 01:35:29,520
Where we're now standing, folks, it's 560 feet
up to the top of the dam,

1803
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,625
The elevator shaft we came down
is to the left

1804
01:35:33,741 --> 01:35:36,602
of the large awning you see
at the top of the duct.

1805
01:35:36,671 --> 01:35:38,738
Can I borrow your glasses a minute?
-Sure.

1806
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:46,765
Thanks.

1807
01:35:46,938 --> 01:35:49,265
Maybe you're right.
We better lose this crowd.

1808
01:35:51,564 --> 01:35:53,089
There he is, come on.

1809
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,028
What do we do now?

1810
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:04,291
If we can climb the Arizona elevators
ahead of that crowd, we've got a chance.

1811
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:39,167
Come on. This way.

1812
01:36:55,005 --> 01:36:57,250
I can't go any further, Mal,
I just can't.

1813
01:36:57,303 --> 01:36:58,269
You've got to.

1814
01:36:58,449 --> 01:36:59,454
Come on.

1815
01:37:16,226 --> 01:37:17,587
Gail, listen to me.

1816
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,069
You wait back there for me.

1817
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:20,575
I'll shake them off and come back
for you.

1818
01:37:21,358 --> 01:37:22,512
Yes.

1819
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:09,590
Take her up to my car.
We'll keep after him.

1820
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:33,668
He must have taken
the Nevada inspection stairway.

1821
01:39:42,664 --> 01:39:44,807
We can take the elevator
and catch him at the top.

1822
01:40:40,444 --> 01:40:42,631
Granger, hold it!

1823
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:08,712
Oh, Mal.

1824
01:41:11,528 --> 01:41:13,720
Give me two to win
on Honeycomb in the fifth.

1825
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:16,233
<i>Only an innocent two dollar bet,
you say?

1826
01:41:16,313 --> 01:41:19,409
<i>It's just as innocent as the germs
in an epidemic.

1827
01:41:19,626 --> 01:41:21,626
<i>Spreading the worst kind of disease.

1828
01:41:21,879 --> 01:41:25,420
<i>The civic disease of criminals
with an $8 billion racket.

1829
01:41:25,886 --> 01:41:27,565
<i>Corrupting politicians,

1830
01:41:27,615 --> 01:41:28,853
<i>buying protection,

1831
01:41:29,353 --> 01:41:32,303
<i>fostering crime,
all with your two dollars.
