1
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,832
[Man] I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.

2
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,933
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,502
My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

4
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:53,351
Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,354
I think he's pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,956
I know I was.

7
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,960
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,658
Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

9
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,360
That's the younger Jim.

10
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,895
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.

11
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,464
I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.

12
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,535
Never missed a chance to do so.

13
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:24,174
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,084
Can't help but wonder
how they'd have operated these times.

15
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:33,023
There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,426
My arrest and my testimony.

17
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,100
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

18
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,658
Paper said it was a crime of passion,

19
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,603
but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,905
Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,878
Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.

22
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,541
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,016
Be there in about 15 minutes.

24
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,883
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,185
I sure do don't.

26
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:09,987
The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.

27
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,725
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:18,500
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,871
But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out

30
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,400
and meet something I don't understand.

31
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,883
A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,648
He'd have to say, "OK.

33
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,820
I'll be part of this world."

34
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,261
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,426
He had some sort of thing on him,

36
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,063
like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something,

37
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,471
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

38
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,067
[Man] Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?

39
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,908
You got me. Well,
you can look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,417
- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, I got it under control.

00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,754
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

163
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,784
Raised a family there. In Temple.

164
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,956
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

165
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,263
- If that's the way you want to put it.
- Well, I don't have some way to put it.

166
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,065
That's the way it is.

167
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:37,079
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

168
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:42,143
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

169
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,781
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't say.

170
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,183
- Call it.
- Call it?

171
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,389
- Yes.
- For what?

172
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,692
Just call it.

173
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,934
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

174
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,441
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.

175
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,602
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.

176
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,205
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

177
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,648
You just didn't know it.

178
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,743
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

179
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:20,121
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

180
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:24,925
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

181
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,361
You have to say. Call it.

182
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,867
Well, look,
I need to know what I stand to win.

183
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,768
- Everything.
- How's that?

184
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,432
You stand to win everything. Call it.

185
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,945
All right. Heads, then.

186
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,980
Well done.

187
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,083
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

188
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,218
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

189
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,252
Where do you want me to put it?

190
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,457
Anywhere not in your pocket.

191
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:04,992
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

192
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,598
Which it is.

193
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,507
[Rustling]

194
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,850
Llewelyn?

195
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,453
What the hell?

196
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,822
- [Llewelyn] Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

197
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,332
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

198
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,696
Well, how come?

199
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:40,033
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

200
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:44,201
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

201
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,540
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

202
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,171
- How long do we?
- What point would you quit

203
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,444
bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

204
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,712
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

205
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,448
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, I'm home!"?

206
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,820
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

207
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,724
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

208
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,954
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

209
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,263
Oh, baby, things happen.

210
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,194
Come on, I can't take them back.

211
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,622
Mind riding bitch?

212
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,840
- This his truck?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,712
Got a screwgie?

214
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:06,483
- Who cut his tires?
- [Man] Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

215
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,455
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

216
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,725
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

217
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,701
These are some ripe petunias.

218
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,637
Hold this, please.

219
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,212
Want it?

220
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,947
- [Man 2] Getting anything on this?
- [Man 3] Not a bleep.

221
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,718
All right.

222
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,219
Give me that.

223
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,733
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

224
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,266
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

225
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,334
Step in there.

226
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,405
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

227
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,576
- I love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

228
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,846
[Exhales]

229
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,581
- Be careful.
- Always am.

230
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,350
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

231
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,289
- Don't hurt no one.
- [Scoffs]

232
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,392
If you say so.

233
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,430
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,864
We should've brought wienies.

235
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,872
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

236
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,171
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

237
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:10,237
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

238
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:14,513
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway,

239
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:20,024
swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

240
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,491
That's very linear, sheriff.

241
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,725
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,891
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

243
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,164
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

244
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:37,504
Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here,

245
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:41,033
I can tell you, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

246
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,981
It's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

247
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,211
You can see the sipes real clear.

248
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,022
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

249
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,854
I know this truck.

250
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,489
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

251
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,398
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

252
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,336
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

253
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:11,171
- I kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

254
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,210
[Flies buzzing]

255
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,008
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

256
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,281
This is just
a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

257
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,618
Yup. Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

258
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:33,186
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

259
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,392
Couple of.45 ACPs.

260
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,198
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

261
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,040
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

262
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,202
I don't know.

263
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,951
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

264
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,487
These boys appear to be managerial.

265
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,851
I think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

266
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,326
Wild West over there.

267
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:09,733
- It's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

268
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,668
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

269
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,602
Then, whoa, differences, and...

270
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,673
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

271
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:23,043
- But you don't believe it?
- [Scoffs] No.

272
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,412
Probably I don't.

273
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,146
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, sheriff?

274
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,925
If it ain't,
it'll do till the mess gets here.

[Woman] Yes, sir?

278
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,936
- I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

279
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,914
- Yes, I did.
- Well, I'd say he's at work.

280
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,951
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

281
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,078
I can't say.

282
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,982
Where does he work?

283
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:50,551
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

284
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,822
Where does he work?

285
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,930
Did you not hear me?

286
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,060
We can't give out no information.

- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

290
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,366
- You can't afford one?
- I don't want to register it.

- Look, I'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

Yes, I do.

- I got a good one. Oughta even out.

Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

- Mama's gonna raise hell.
- Mm-hm.

She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

- Well, you should be used to that.
- I'm used to lots of things.

- I work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

- I'm hiding behind you.

Wait up!

487

[TV]... and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me,

488
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,568
and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

489
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:24,204
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight,

490
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,114
though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight

491
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:31,619
instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

[Woman] Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,720
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

on his way to Odessa?

01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:55,141
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

563
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,854
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... about me.

a little of the money.

why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

He's a peculiar man.

575

Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs

576
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:56,597
or anything like that. Not like you.

- Not word one.

- Well, I don't know.

- Some pretty bad people.

They won't quit.

got that place out east of Sanderson?

591
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:52,618

beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul,

You'll excuse the... Well...

01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,035
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head,

598
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:12,137
but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

599
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:14,842
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

600
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:18,545
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

601
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,852
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer,

602
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,721
the issue is not certain.

603
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:37,064

just tell him I can make him safe.

- I don't know.

608
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,128
My mind wanders.

609
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,545
Hello, Carson.

01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:34,446
Let's go to your room.

611
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:49,362
You don't have to do this.

612
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:53,464
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

613
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,277
- You could.
- Make it worth your while,

614
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:02,544
take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

615
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,949
And everybody just walks away.

616
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,381
An ATM.

617
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,488
I know where the satchel is.

618
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,827
If you knew, you would have it with you.

619
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:21,801
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

- I know something better.
- What's that?

621
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,831
Where it's going to be.

622
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:33,004
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me

623
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,572
and placed at my feet.

624
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,387
You don't know to a certainty.

625
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:44,414
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

626
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:47,188
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

627
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:52,893
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

628
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,872
- You go to hell.
- [Chuckles]

629
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,975
All right.
Let me ask you something.

630
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:11,548
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,

631
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,213
of what use was the rule?

632
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,696
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

633
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:27,232
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

634
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,463
I mean the nature of you.

635
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:39,611
You... You can have the money, Anton.

636
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:45,716
[Phone rings]

637
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:01,031
- [Wells grunts]
- [Phone continues to ring]

638
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:22,053
- [Llewelyn] Hello?
- Yes?

639
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,956
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

640
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,688
Not in the sense that you mean.

641
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:37,861
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

642
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:40,931
You know who it is.

643
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:44,172
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

644
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,577
I think you do.

645
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,377
Do you know where I'm going?

646
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,044
Why would I care where you're going?

647
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:53,781
I know where you are.

648
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,050
Yeah, where am I?

649
01:24:56,124 --> 01:25:00,390
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

650
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:03,389
Do you know where I'm going?

651
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:09,260
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

652
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:10,895
You know she won't be there.

653
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:13,440
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

654
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:15,669
So, what're you going up there for?

655
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,545
[Sighs]

656
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:21,839
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

657
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,342
Nope.

658
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,686
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

659
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,252
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

660
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:37,992
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

661
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:42,501
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

662
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:46,506
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

663
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:53,213
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

664
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,442
Decided to make you a project of mine.

665
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,179
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

666
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,050
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

667
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,889
None of the three had ID on 'em,

668
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:10,727
but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

669
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:15,667
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

670
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,606
Yes, sir.

671
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,268
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

672
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,971
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

673
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,805
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for,

674
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,408
it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

675
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:35,422
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

676
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,357
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

677
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:42,419
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

678
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:45,955
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

679
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,765
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,

680
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,135
cash their Social Security checks.

681
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:56,337
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

682
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:59,639
Maybe their television set was broke.

683
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:03,081
And this went on until, here, I quote,

684
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:07,053
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises

685
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:09,112
wearing only a dog collar."

686
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:13,850
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

687
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:17,625
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

688
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,429
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

689
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:22,196
[Suppresses laughter]

690
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:30,872
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

691
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,006
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

692
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,610
Tell me something.

693
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:42,679
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

694
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,984
I don't know. American citizens?

695
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,962
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

696
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,022
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

697
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,398
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

698
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:58,405
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

699
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,838
If I don't, they don't.

700
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:01,966
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

701
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:04,705
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

702
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,672
Well, I got an overcoat on.

703
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,884
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

704
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,011
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

705
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,816
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

706
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,358
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

707
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:21,020
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion,

708
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:24,690
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

709
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,337
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

710
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:33,966
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

711
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,420
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

712
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,047
- I need everything else.
- OK.

713
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:52,718
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

714
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:55,126
No, sir. It's unusual.

715
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:11,601
- [Woman] She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

716
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,204
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care,

717
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,580
and don't you hang up this phone.

718
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:19,814
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

719
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,853
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

720
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:26,087
- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?

721
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,891
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

722
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:33,263
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

723
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:37,131
- You're hurt, ain't you?
- [Scoffs]

724
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,469
What makes you say that?

725
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,101
- I can hear it in your voice.
- [Woman] It's falseness in his voice!

726
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:46,772
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

727
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:49,316
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

728
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,818
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

729
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:55,083
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money,

730
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:57,954
he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

731
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,687
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

732
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:04,220
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

733
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:06,198
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

734
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:08,792
[Woman] Be all right? I got the cancer!

735
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,838
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

736
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:36,654
[Man gurgles]

737
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,938
- [Gurgling continues]
- Hmm.

738
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:46,896
Who are you?

739
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,110
- Me?
- Yes.

740
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,376
Nobody.

741

Accounting.

742
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:01,054
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

743
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,359
He feels...

744
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:09,055
He felt that the more people looking...

745
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:14,067
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

746
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,534
I see.

747
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,066
Are you going to shoot me?

748
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,111
That depends.

749
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,077
Do you see me?

750
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:37,817
[Woman] I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

751
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:42,192
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

752
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:46,461
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good."

753
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:50,197
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

754
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:55,675
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

755
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:59,175
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

756
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:02,410
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

757
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:05,418
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

758

- I put it in, Mama.

761
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:21,396
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

762

You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

You need help with the bags, madam?

764

Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

767
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,121
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

768
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,749
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

769

Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

772
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:54,590
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

773
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,762
[chuckles] Um...

774
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:59,397
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail,

775
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:03,000
- but it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

776
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:06,911
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

777
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:08,915
Yes, ma'am.

778
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:13,613
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you

779
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,851
who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

780
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:20,860
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

781
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,795
He never thinks he needs any.

782
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:27,766
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

783
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:31,271
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

784
01:33:40,214 --> 01:33:42,307
What's the problem there, neighbor?

785
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:46,752
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

786
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:52,322
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

787
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:56,454
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

788
01:33:56,530 --> 01:34:00,728
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

789
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:04,567
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

790
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,099
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? [laughs] Brother, I been there.

791
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:12,875
Well, there's airstrips.

792
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:15,279
The airport is El Paso.

793
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:17,146
If you want someplace specific,

794
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:21,177
you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

795
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,450
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

796
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:26,425
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

797
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,361
What are you talking about?

798
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:49,272
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

799
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:53,309
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

800
01:34:53,387 --> 01:34:55,787
Yeah, that's me.

801
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:58,654
I got beers in my room.

802
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:02,628
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

803
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,530
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

804
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:08,227
- Well, half.
- What else then?

805
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:13,137
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- [Woman] Yeah.

806
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:15,903
But no one ever sees that.

807
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:19,275
Beer! That's what's comin'.

808
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:22,144
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

809
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,707
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

810
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:26,480
[Laughs]

811
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,681
Beer leads to more beer.

812
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:38,388
[Rapid gunfire]

813
01:35:38,466 --> 01:35:41,594
- [Men shouting in Spanish]
- [Tires squealing]

814
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,908
[Woman sobbing]

815
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:00,920
[Woman screams]

816
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,526
[Women crying]

817
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,070
You all right?

818
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,208
Call the police.

819
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:26,940
[Speaks Spanish]

820
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,314
Your local law enforcement.

821
01:36:33,654 --> 01:36:35,645
I'm not on their radio.

822
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:38,453
[Man] I met his daughter at the...

823
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:29,103
[man] Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

824
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:32,737
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

825
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:35,145
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

826
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:37,776
I suppose so.

827
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,013
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

828
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:45,286
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

829
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,122
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

830
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:53,095
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

831
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:56,227
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago

832
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:59,431
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns

833
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:02,634
with green hair, bones in their noses,

834
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,270
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

835
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:06,904
Signs and wonders.

836
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:11,543
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

837
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,348
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

838
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:17,254
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

839
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:18,916
Not the one thing.

840
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:21,860
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

841
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:25,057
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

842
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:28,499
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

843
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:31,936
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

844
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,940
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

845
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:37,774
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

846
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:40,405
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

847
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:43,382
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

848
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,416
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

849
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:50,981
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

850
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:52,548
It's hard to believe.

851
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:55,891
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

852
01:38:55,963 --> 01:39:01,333
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

853
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:04,394
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

854
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:06,871
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

855
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:34,899
[Engine shuts off]

856
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:44,210
[Sighs]

857
01:41:48,969 --> 01:41:51,164
[Sighs]

858
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:56,531
[Airplane flies overheard]

859
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:35,309
[Cats meow]

860
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:42,217
- [Man] In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

861
01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:45,383
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

862
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:47,017
- You heard it?
- How's that?

863
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:51,292
Did you hear my?
You're having fun with me.

864
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:55,734
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

865
01:42:55,802 --> 01:43:00,603
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

866
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,835
How many of them things you got now?

867
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:05,435
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

868
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:08,811
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got."

869
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:13,114
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

870
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,921
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

871
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:24,594
I got to say, you're looking older.

872
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:26,189
I am older.

873
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:29,802
Got a letter from your wife.

874
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:34,307
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

875
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:38,071
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

876
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,545
[Inhales, exhales deeply]

877
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:44,049
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

878
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,389
How fresh is that coffee?

879
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:59,194
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

880
01:44:01,134 --> 01:44:03,466
That man that shot you died in prison?

881
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:08,069
Angola. Yeah.

882
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:10,939
What'd you done he'd a been released?

883
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:13,912
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

884
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:15,608
Wouldn't be no point in it.

885
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:18,947
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

886
01:44:19,019 --> 01:44:22,750
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back

887
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:26,486
what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

888
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,529
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

889
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:34,727
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

890
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:41,564
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

891
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:43,940
I don't know.

892
01:44:46,647 --> 01:44:48,308
I feel overmatched.

893
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:55,480
I always figured when I got older,

894
01:44:55,555 --> 01:45:00,458
God would... sort of
come into my life somehow.

895
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:04,521
And He didn't.

896
01:45:08,402 --> 01:45:10,029
And I don't blame Him.

897
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:15,341
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

898
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:17,773
You don't know what He thinks.

899
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:35,723
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers,

900
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,424
put it in their museum.

901
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:42,127
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

902
01:45:43,203 --> 01:45:46,764
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

903
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:53,878
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

904
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:56,916
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

905
01:45:56,983 --> 01:46:00,612
Well, they was ahead of him.

906
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:03,417
Shot him in his doorway.

907
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:06,084
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

908
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:10,095
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

909
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:14,600
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

910
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:19,866
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

911
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:22,571
Left out.

912
01:46:24,745 --> 01:46:28,237
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

913
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:31,443
Shot through the left lung.

914
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:36,046
And that was that... as they say.

915
01:46:39,326 --> 01:46:40,623
When'd he die?

916
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:45,262
Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?

917
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:49,166
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

918
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,933
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

919
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:58,034
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

920
01:47:00,981 --> 01:47:03,745
What you got ain't nothin' new.

921
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:07,581
This country is hard on people.

922
01:47:11,324 --> 01:47:13,451
You can't stop what's coming.

923
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:17,321
It ain't all waitin' on you.

924
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:22,032
That's vanity.

925
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:25,329
I knew this wasn't done with.

926
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:30,068
I ain't got the money.

927
01:48:32,105 --> 01:48:36,337
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

928
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:42,806
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

929
01:48:43,817 --> 01:48:45,682
I wouldn't worry about it.

930
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:49,879
I need to sit down.

931
01:49:05,171 --> 01:49:07,264
You got no cause to hurt me.

932
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:11,174
No. But I gave my word.

933
01:49:12,612 --> 01:49:16,241
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

934
01:49:19,252 --> 01:49:22,016
That don't make sense.

935
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:25,319
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

936
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:28,884
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

937
01:49:28,962 --> 01:49:31,829
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

938
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:38,827
Not like that.

939
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:42,238
Not like you say.

940
01:49:48,315 --> 01:49:50,112
You don't have to do this.

941
01:49:50,183 --> 01:49:52,447
People always say the same thing.

942
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:55,449
What do they say?

943
01:49:56,556 --> 01:49:58,786
They say, "You don't have to do this."

944
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:05,023
- You don't.
- OK.

945
01:50:10,136 --> 01:50:12,127
This is the best I can do.

946
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:14,228
Call it.

947
01:50:18,745 --> 01:50:22,340
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

948
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:27,379
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

949
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:31,788
- Call it.
- No.

950
01:50:31,858 --> 01:50:34,383
I ain't gonna call it.

951
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:39,163
Call it.

952
01:50:39,232 --> 01:50:42,292
The coin don't have no say.

953
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:44,234
It's just you.

954
01:50:46,773 --> 01:50:49,867
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

955
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:54,876
[Rattling]

956
01:51:18,738 --> 01:51:21,332
[Boys chattering]

957
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:57,701
- [Glass clattering]
- [Groaning]

958
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:13,617
[Breathing heavily]

959
01:52:28,308 --> 01:52:32,404
[Groaning]

960
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:35,642
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

961
01:52:35,715 --> 01:52:38,115
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

962
01:52:38,184 --> 01:52:41,119
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

963
01:52:41,187 --> 01:52:43,485
All right.

964
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:47,390
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

965
01:52:48,661 --> 01:52:50,629
What'll you take for the shirt?

966
01:52:50,697 --> 01:52:53,165
- [Sirens approaching]
- [Panting]

967
01:52:55,201 --> 01:52:58,170
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

968
01:53:05,178 --> 01:53:08,636
Look at that fucking bone.

969
01:53:08,715 --> 01:53:09,875
Tie this for me.

970
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:12,952
Just tie it, just tie it.

971
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:16,482
- [Sirens approaching]
- [Exhales]

972
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:34,997
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

973
01:53:35,074 --> 01:53:37,565
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

974
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:40,772
Take it and... you didn't see me.

975
01:53:40,847 --> 01:53:43,111
- I was already gone.
- [Sirens approaching]

976
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:44,480
Yes, sir.

977
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:52,415
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

978
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:56,895
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

979
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:19,644
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

980
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:23,587
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

981
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:28,385
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

982
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:34,833
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... better not.

983
01:54:39,138 --> 01:54:42,471
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

984
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:46,911
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

985
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,813
They always is to the party concerned.

986
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:54,645
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

987
01:54:57,090 --> 01:55:02,187
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

988
01:55:02,262 --> 01:55:05,254
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

989
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:09,199
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

990
01:55:09,269 --> 01:55:12,363
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

991
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:15,168
but it was about meeting him in town,

992
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:17,835
somewheres,
and he give me some money.

993
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:19,538
I think I lost it.

994
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:26,250
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

995
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,415
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

996
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:33,926
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

997
01:55:33,993 --> 01:55:37,394
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

998
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:39,931
And he rode past me and kept on going,

999
01:55:39,999 --> 01:55:42,763
never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

1000
01:55:44,404 --> 01:55:48,204
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

1001
01:55:50,009 --> 01:55:54,002
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

1002
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,980
the way people used to do, and I...

1003
01:55:56,049 --> 01:55:58,643
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

1004
01:55:58,718 --> 01:56:00,447
'bout the color of the moon.

1005
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,287
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

1006
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:06,955
...going on ahead.

1007
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,429
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

1008
01:56:16,035 --> 01:56:19,027
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

1009
01:56:23,576 --> 01:56:25,544
And then I woke up.
