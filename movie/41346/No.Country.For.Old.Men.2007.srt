1
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,500
我二十五歲那年
I was sheriff of this county...

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,830
是這個郡的警長
when I was 25 years old.

3
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,930
難以置信
Hard to believe.

4
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,500
我祖父是個警察 父親也是
My grandfather was a lawman. Father too.

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,890
我跟父親同時當警長
Me and him was sheriffs at the same time,

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,350
他當時在布蘭諾 而我在這
him up in Plano and me out here.

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,350
我想他一定以此為傲
I think he's pretty proud of that.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,950
我知道我是的
I know I was.

9
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,960
老一輩的警長們通常連手槍也不帶
Some of the old-time sheriffs never even wore a gun.

10
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,830
有很多人覺得難以置信
Folks find that hard to believe.

11
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,650
吉姆·斯卡布羅就從未帶過槍
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

12
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,360
那是年輕的吉姆
That's the younger Jim.

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,400
卡曼契郡的卡司頓·伯金斯...
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear...

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,890
也不帶槍
one up in Comanche County.

15
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,460
現在我總喜歡聽關於這些老前輩的事情
I always liked to hear about the old-timers.

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,530
從不想錯過一個
Never missed a chance to do so.

17
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,100
因此很難不把自己...
You can't help but compare yourself...

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,170
跟老前輩們作比較
against the old-timers.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,500
也不禁好奇
Can't help but wonder...

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,080
他們那時是怎麼做到的
how they'd have operated these times.

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,700
有一個男孩是我不久之前...
There's this boy I sent to the...

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,020
在亨斯維爾這堸e他上電椅的
electric chair at Huntsville here a while back.

23
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,420
我親自逮捕 訊問他
My arrest and my testimony.

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,100
他殺了一個十四歲的女孩
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,650
報紙上寫說那是件激情犯罪
Paper said it was a crime of passion,

26
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,600
但是他告訴我說 根本沒有半點激情
but he told me there wasn't any passion to it.

27
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,780
他告訴我說它的殺人行為
Told me he'd planned to kill somebody...

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,900
都是經過長時間縝密計劃的
for as long as he could remember.

29
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,870
他還說要是放他出來 他還是會去殺人
Said if they turned him out, he'd do it again.

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,540
他也說他知道 他將會下地獄
Said he knew he was going to hell.

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,010
大概在那堳搕W十五分鐘
Be there in about 15 minutes.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,880
我不明白是什麼導致這樣
I don't know what to make of that.

33
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,180
真的不懂
I sure do don't.

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,800
你現在看到的犯罪
The crime you see now,

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,000
也很難去採取什麼措施
it's hard to even take its measure.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,720
不是我害怕
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

37
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,100
我原本就知道
I always knew you had to...

38
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,500
做這行本來就要有心理準備
be willing to die to even do this job.

39
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,500
但我不想探出頭去
But I don't want to push my chips forward and...

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,400
走出去 面對我不瞭解的東西
go out and meet something I don't understand.

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,880
有時候 男人必須暴露在風險中
A man would have to put his soul at hazard.

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,640
他只需要說:"好的
He'd have to say, "OK.

43
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,820
我要成為這世上的一部分"
I'll be part of this world."

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,260
是 長官 我剛進門
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

45
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,420
他身上有些東西
He had some sort of thing on him,

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,060
像是肺病病人用的氧氣筒什麼的
like a oxygen tank for emphysema or something,

47
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,470
一條軟管從他袖子埵虪X來
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,060
氧氣罐? 他拿那個幹什麼?
Oxygen tank? What the hell's he got that for?

49
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,200
你放心 有我在
You got me.

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,900
當你進來的時候 你就會看到了
Well, you can look at it when you get in.

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,800
我一會兒就過去
I'll be down there in a bit.

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,410
好的長官 一切在控制中
Yes, sir, I got it under control.

53
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,190
您好 怎麼回事?
Howdy. What's this about?

54
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,170
請下車 先生
Step out of the car please, sir.

55
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,440
那是什麼?
What is that?

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,880
我需要您下車 先生
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,690
- 那個是幹什麼的? - 你能不能?
- What is that for? - Would you?

58
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,790
能不能站著不要動 先生?
Would you hold still please, sir?

59
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,790
不要動
You hold still.

60
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,730
可惡
Shit.

61
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,950
水
Agua.

62
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,010
水
Agua.

63
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,860
水
Agua.

64
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,700
我沒有水
I ain't got no water.

65
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,840
水
Agua.

66
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,480
水
Agua.

67
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,820
我給你說了我沒有水
I told you I ain't got no agua.

68
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,000
你會說英文嗎?
Do you speak English?

69
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,370
最後一個人呢?
Where's the last guy?

70
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,810
最後一個人 最後一個
Ultimo hombre, last man standing.

71
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,180
一定還有 他去哪了?
There must have been one. Where'd he go?

72
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,420
我猜想我可以從來的地方出去
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

73
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,590
有野狼
Hay lobos.

74
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,030
沒有野狼
There ain't no lobos.

75
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,810
要是你停下來 看著你的回頭路
You stopped to watch your backtrack.

76
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,720
你將會射中我
Now shoot my dumb ass.

77
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,590
但如果你停下來
But if you stop,

78
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,650
你會停在陰影處
you stopped in shade.

79
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,880
是的
Yeah.

80
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,950
我坐錯地方了麼?
My place is wrong?

81
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,100
你的是正座...
Yours is the first place...

82
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,620
丹澤和多拉會看的 如果他們...
Danzer and Dora will look if they...

83
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,680
如果他們知道的話
If they know.

84
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,790
- 皮箱堶惘酗偵? - 滿滿都是錢
- What's in the satchel? - It's full of money.

85
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,100
要那樣就好了
That would be the day.

86
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,550
你在哪弄到的手槍?
Where'd you get the pistol?

87
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,930
在我拿到它的地方
At the gettin' place.

88
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,430
- 槍是你買的嗎? - 不 是我發現的
- Did you buy that gun? - No. I found it.

89
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,840
- 溫利 - 什麼? 你別再發牢騷了
- Llewelyn. - What? Quit your hollering.

90
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,440
你拿什麼換來的?
What'd you get for that thing?

91
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,820
你不必樣樣都知道 卡拉·珍
You don't need to know everything, Carla Jean.

92
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,500
我必須知道
I need to know that.

93
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,290
你要是再喋喋不休
Keep running that mouth of yours,

94
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,990
我會把你綁起來
I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.

95
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,150
- 說大話 - 繼續呀
- Big talk. - Keep it up.

96
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,320
很好 我不想知道
Fine. I don't want to know.

97
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,360
我甚至不想知道你一整天去了哪
I don't even want to know where you been all day.

98
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,170
那樣最好
That'll work.

99
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,850
好的
All right.

100
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,990
- 奧萊溫利 - 怎麼了?
- Llewelyn? - Yeah?

101
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,670
- 寶貝 你在做什麼? - 我要出去
- What're you doing, baby? - I'm going out.

102
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,900
去哪?
Going where?

103
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,870
我忘了做件事情 很快會回來
A little something I forgot to do, but I'll be back.

104
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,600
你要做什麼事情?
And what're you gonna do?

105
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,270
我要去做一件說不清的事情
I'm fixing to do something...

106
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,570
但現在我無論如何都要去做
dumber than hell, but I'm going anyways.

107
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,180
我要是沒有回來 告訴媽媽我愛她
If I don't come back, you tell Mother I love her.

108
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,380
你母親已經死了 奧萊溫利
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

109
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,750
好吧 那我自己告訴她
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

110
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,290
- 多少錢? - 69分
- How much? - Sixty-nine cents.

111
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,850
還有汽油?
And the gas?

112
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,450
一路上有下雨嗎?
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

113
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,100
那條路是通往哪的?
What way would that be?

114
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,720
我看你是從達拉斯來的
Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

115
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,800
我打哪來的關你啥事...
What business is it of yours where I'm from...

116
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,400
...老兄?
...friendo?

117
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,090
我什麼意思也沒有
Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.

118
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,070
你什麼意思也沒有?
You didn't mean nothing?

119
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,510
只是想打發時間而已
I was just passing the time.

120
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,710
如果這樣你也受不了
If you don't want to accept that,

121
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,650
那我不知道我還能幫你什麼
I don't know what else I can do for you.

122
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,410
還有什麼事情?
Will there be something else?

123
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,130
我不知道 會有嗎?
I don't know. Will there?

124
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,400
- 有什麼不對勁? - 不對勁什麼?
- Is something wrong? - With what?

125
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,870
任何事情?
With anything.

126
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,020
那就是你要問我的嗎?
Is that what you're asking me?

127
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,100
是否有什麼事情不對勁嗎?
Is there something wrong with anything?

128
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,890
還有什麼事?
Will there be anything else?

129
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,610
這你已經問過我了
You already asked me that.

130
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,200
嗯...我想我要關門了
Well, I need to see about closing now.

131
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,540
要關門?
See about closing?

132
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,550
- 是的先生 - 你幾點關門?
- Yes, sir. - What time do you close?

133
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,880
- 現在 就是現在關 - 現在沒說是幾點啊
- Now. We close now. - Now is not a time.

134
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,500
你幾點關門?
What time do you close?

135
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,090
大概天黑的時候 天黑就關
Generally around dark. At dark.

136
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,890
你不知道你在說什麼 對吧?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?

137
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,060
先生?
Sir?

138
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,800
我說你不知道你在說什麼
I said you don't know what you're talking about.

139
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,870
- 你幾點鐘睡覺? - 先生?
- What time do you go to bed? - Sir?

140
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,740
你難道是聾子嗎?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

141
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,540
我說你幾點鐘睡覺?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

142
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,250
哦
Oh.

143
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,480
大約晚上九點半 我會說大約九點半
Somewhere around 9:30. I'd say around 9:30.

144
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,110
我可以那個時候再來
I could come back then.

145
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,620
你要再來做什麼? 我們已經關門了啊
Why would you be coming back? We'll be closed.

146
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,460
是啊 沒錯
Yeah, you said that.

147
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,980
嗯...我現在得關門了
Well, I got to close now.

148
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,260
你住在後面那房子嗎?
You live in that house out back?

149
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,400
- 是的 - 從出生就住在這嗎?
- Yes, I do. - You lived here all your life?

150
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,070
這是我岳父的房子 原本是
Well, this is my wife's father's place, originally.

151
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,770
你是招贅進來的?
You married into it?

152
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,750
之前我們住在德州天普市許多年
We lived in Temple, Texas for many years.

153
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,780
全家人都住在一起 在天普市
Raised a family there. In Temple.

154
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,500
大約四年前我們搬到這
We come out here about four years ago.

155
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,950
你是招贅進來的?
You married into it?

156
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,640
如果你非要這樣說的話
If that's the way you want to put it.

157
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,260
我沒非要這樣說
Well, I don't have some way to put it.

158
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,060
事情就是那樣
That's the way it is.

159
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:37,070
你玩硬幣遊戲最多輸掉多少?
What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?

160
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,140
- 先生? - 你玩硬幣遊戲最多輸掉多少?
- Sir? - The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

161
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,780
哦 我不知道 我說不上來
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't say.

162
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,180
- 猜吧 - 猜?
- Call it. - Call it?

163
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,380
- 是的 - 為什麼?
- Yes. - For what?

164
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,690
只管猜
Just call it.

165
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,930
我們得先知道為什麼要猜
We need to know what we're calling it for here.

166
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,440
你必須猜 我不能幫你猜
You need to call it. I can't call it for you.

167
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,050
那樣不公平
Or it wouldn't be fair.

168
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,600
我什麼也沒有要賭
I didn't put nothing up.

169
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,400
不 你有
Yes, you did.

170
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
你這輩子 不就是一直在下注
You've been putting it up your whole life.

171
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,640
你只是不知道而已
You just didn't know it.

172
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,740
- 你知道這硬幣是什麼年份的嗎? - 不知道
- You know what date is on this coin? - No.

173
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,120
1958年 已經過去22年了 這硬幣才流浪到此
1958. It's been traveling 22 years to get here.

174
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,920
現在來到這 不是正面就是反面
And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails.

175
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,360
你必須說出來 猜吧
You have to say. Call it.

176
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,860
聽著... 我必須知道 猜對了我贏得什麼
Well, look, I need to know what I stand to win.

177
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,760
- 所有的東西 - 什麼?
- Everything. - How's that?

178
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,430
猜對了你就得到了一切 猜吧
You stand to win everything. Call it.

179
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,940
好吧 那就正面
All right. Heads, then.

180
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,980
很好
Well done.

181
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,080
- 別放到口袋去 - 什麼?
- Don't put it in your pocket. - Sir?

182
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,200
別放到口袋去
Don't put it in your pocket.

183
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,210
那是你的幸運硬幣
It's your lucky quarter.

184
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,250
那你要我放哪?
Where do you want me to put it?

185
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,450
哪堻ㄕn 就是別放口袋
Anywhere not in your pocket.

186
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,500
放進去跟其他硬幣混在一起
Or it'll get mixed in with the others...

187
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,990
它就只是個硬幣而已了
and become just a coin.

188
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,590
跟原本一樣了
Which it is.

189
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,850
奧萊溫利?
Llewelyn?

190
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,450
怎麼回事?
What the hell?

191
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,820
- 奧德薩市 - 我們為何要去奧德薩?
- Odessa. - Why would we go to Odessa?

192
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,330
不是我們 是你 待在你母親家
No, not we. You. You stay with your mother.

193
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,690
嗯 為什麼?
Well, how come?

194
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,890
聽著 現在是週日午夜
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.

195
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,030
九個小時後 法院開始上班
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

196
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,150
有人將會來查證...
Someone's gonna call in the number...

197
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,200
貨車檢查板上的車輛編號
on the inspection plate of my truck.

198
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,540
在9:30左右 他們會來這
And around 9:30, they'll show up here.

199
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,170
- 但是 我們要多久才能? - 什麼時候你才會放棄
- How long do we? - What point would you quit

200
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,440
希望得到兩百萬元的夢想?
bothering to look for your two million dollars?

201
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,710
我要怎樣跟媽媽說?
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

202
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,440
就站在門口大聲叫喊　 "媽媽 我回來了"
Stand in the door and holler, "Mama, I'm home!"?

203
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,820
- 奧萊溫利 - 快 將你的東西打包
- Llewelyn. - Come on, pack your things.

204
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,720
任何留下來的東西 將不會再見到
Anything you leave, you ain't gonna see again.

205
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,950
嗯 不用道歉
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

206
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,260
寶貝 事情已經發生
Oh, baby, things happen.

207
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,190
快 我無法回頭
Come on, I can't take them back.

208
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,620
不用腦子思考的賤人?
Mind riding bitch?

209
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,840
- 這是他的車嗎? - 嗯
- This his truck? - Mm-hmm.

210
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,710
有螺絲刀嗎?
Got a screwgie?

211
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,000
誰刺破他的輪胎?
Who cut his tires?

212
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,480
我猜是墨西哥人 不是我們的人
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

213
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,450
- 是一隻死狗 - 是啊
- That is a dead dog. - Yes, it is.

214
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,720
- 接收器在哪? - 在我這
- Where's the receiver? - I've got it.

215
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,700
他們都爛了
These are some ripe petunias.

216
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,630
拿著這個
Hold this, please.

217
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,210
你要這個?
Want it?

218
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,940
- 有接收到什麼嗎? - 一點聲響也沒
- Getting anything on this? - Not a bleep.

219
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,710
好吧
All right.

220
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,210
手電筒給我
Give me that.

221
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,730
- 我以為是汽車著火了呢 - 是汽車著火了
- I thought it was a car afire. - It is a car afire.

222
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,400
但是溫道爾說曠野地區...
Wendell said there's something...

223
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,260
還有些狀況
in the back country too.

224
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,330
進去
Step in there.

225
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,900
郡堶惜偵糪伬
When's the county gonna start...

226
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,400
才會付我馬的租金啊?
paying rent on my horse?

227
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,500
我越來越愛你了
I love you more and more every day.

228
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,570
那很好
That's very nice.

229
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,580
- 要小心 - 我一直是的
- Be careful. - Always am.

230
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,350
- 別受傷了 - 從來不會
- Don't get hurt. - Never do.

231
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,280
也別傷人
Don't hurt no one.

232
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,390
如果你這樣說的話
If you say so.

233
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,430
- 沒見過燒成這樣子的車 - 是 長官
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that. - Yes, sir.

234
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,860
我們該帶香腸來烤的
We should've brought wienies.

235
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,870
看來是一輛 77年福特 是嗎 溫道爾?
That look like about a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

236
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,000
可能是
It could be.

237
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,170
我說一定是 絕對是
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

238
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,400
這老傢伙在公路上被殺?
The old boy shot by the highway?

239
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,230
是 先生 他的車
Yes, sir. His vehicle.

240
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,410
疑犯在高速公路上殺死了...
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,

241
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,510
埃瑪的副警長 並開走他的車
killed that man on the highway,

242
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,300
換開他的車 那車現在就在這
swapped for his car, now here it is...

243
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,020
他又不曉得換了什麼車走了
and he's swapped again for God knows what.

244
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,490
看來那樣很直接呀 警長
That's very linear, sheriff.

245
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,720
- 是呀 歲月讓人腦袋變簡單 - 是 長官
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell. - Yes, sir.

246
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,890
- 但還有其他的 - 是的
- Then there's this other. - Yeah.

247
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,160
- 你騎溫士頓 - 你確定?
- You ride Winston. - You sure?

248
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,800
喔 我當然確定
Oh, I'm more than sure.

249
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,500
要是洛蕾塔的馬有什麼事情
If anything happens to Loretta's horse out here,

250
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,500
我可以告訴你
I can tell you,

251
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,030
我絕對承受不起
I don't want to be the party that was aboard.

252
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,000
來回的車痕 都是同一種輪胎的印記
It's the same tire tread coming back as going.

253
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,980
也是差不多時間產生的
Made about the same time too.

254
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,210
你可以清楚的看到輪胎的壓痕
You can see the sipes real clear.

255
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,800
有人將檢查板...
Somebody's pried the inspection...

256
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,020
從車門上撬走了
plate off the door on this one.

257
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,850
我知道這貨車
I know this truck.

258
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,480
是一個叫做摩斯的小伙子的
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

259
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,390
- 奧萊溫利·摩斯? - 就是他
- Llewelyn Moss? - That's the boy.

260
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,330
- 你覺得他是個毒癮逃犯? - 我不知道
- You figure him for a dope runner? - I don't know.

261
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,170
- 有點懷疑 - 槍戰就在那邊
- I kindly doubt it. - O.K. Corral is just yonder.

262
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,000
喔 天啊 他們連狗都射殺
Oh, hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

263
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,280
看起來像是交易中出了差錯 對嗎?
This is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

264
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,610
是呀 似乎是出了一兩個差錯
Yup. Appears to have been a glitch or two.

265
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,500
那是什麼口徑的 警長?
What calibers you got there, sheriff?

266
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,180
九毫米
Nine-millimeter.

267
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,390
還有一些0.45英吋ACP彈
Couple of.45 ACPs.

268
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,190
有人用霰彈槍處理了那條狗
Somebody unloaded on that thing with a shotgun.

269
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,040
你覺得為什麼野狼不來吃這些屍體?
How come the coyotes ain't been at them?

270
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,200
我不知道
I don't know.

271
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,950
我猜是因為它們不吃墨西哥人
Supposedly, a coyote won't eat a Mexican.

272
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,480
這些人看上去衣冠楚楚
These boys appear to be managerial.

273
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,500
我認為 我們看到的不是只有一場騷動
I think we're looking at more than one fracas.

274

next to yours if you want, 137. It ain't took.

408
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,740
不要 38號房可以
No, 38 will be fine.

409
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,770
那間有兩張雙人床
Well, that's got two double beds.

410
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,400
你們怎麼找到的?
How'd you find that?

411
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,780
你不該這樣做的
You shouldn't be doin' that.

412
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:41,380
即使像你這樣的年輕人
Even a young man like you.

413
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,120
- 不應該做什麼? - 搭便車
- Doin' what? - Hitchhiking.

414
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,590
太危險了
Dangerous.

415
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,140
你認得安通·希格爾 對嗎?
You know Anton Chigurh by sight, is that correct?

416
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,750
是 先生 我瞭解他各個方面
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

417
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,190
你上次見他是什麼時候?
When did you last see him?

418
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,750
呃...
Uh...

419
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:24,990
...去年11月28號
...November 28th, last year.

420
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,330
你似乎把這日期記得特別清楚 我有要你坐下嗎?
Seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?

421
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,180
沒有 先生 但你教過我
No, sir, but you struck me as a man...

422
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,230
要成為一個不要浪費椅子的男人
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

423
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,050
我對日期 人名 數字記憶力特好
I remember dates, names, numbers.

424
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,800
我上次見到他是11月28日
I saw him November the 28th.

425
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,640
現在我們要面對一個 我行我素不顧後果的人
Got a loose cannon here.

426
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,430
我們還損失了一大票金錢
We're out a bunch of money,

427
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,150
還有另一組人馬也在覬覦
and the other party is out his product.

428
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,400
- 是 先生 - 這個帳戶每24小時
- Yes, sir. - This account will give up $1,200

429
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,450
最多可提領一千兩百美元 一次最多可以提領一千美元
in any 24-hour period. That's up from a thousand.

430
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,610
要是你的花費比這個高
If your expenses run higher,

431
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,690
我希望你值得我們信任
I hope you'll trust us for it.

432
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,860
好的
OK.

433
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,400
你有多瞭解希格爾?
Just how well do you know Chigurh?

434
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,700
你要瞭解些什麼?
What do you wanna know?

435
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:07,670
我要知道你對他的看法 整體的看法
I just wanna know your opinion of him, in general.

436
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,470
也就是他有多麼危險?
Just how dangerous is he?

437
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,200
跟什麼來比較? 跟黑死病嗎?
Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

438
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,470
對我來說 他實在是夠壞了
He's bad enough you called me.

439
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:20,040
是啊 他是個喪心病狂殺手 那又如何?
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer, but so what?

440
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,920
世界上這種人多的是
There's plenty of them around.

441
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,680
他昨天在爾德媔曭漁館殺死了三個人
Killed three men in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

442
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,550
還有在那沙漠野外...
and two others in that colossal...

443
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,350
另外殺了兩個
goat-fuck out in the desert.

444
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,360
- 我們可以阻止他的 - 你似乎對自己很有信心
- We can stop that. - Seem pretty sure of yourself.

445
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,200
你過去的日子 似乎過得還不錯
You've led something of a charmed life,

446
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,000
是嗎 威爾斯先生?
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

447
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,700
老實說 我認為我的生活如何
In all honesty, I can't say that...

448
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,340
跟這些一點關係也沒有
charm has had a whole lot to do with it.

449
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,440
- 我在想... - 什麼?
- I was wondering... - Yes?

450
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,510
你可以讓我的停車證恢復有效嗎?
Could you validate my parking ticket?

451
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,150
- 我想 你是在開玩笑吧 - 抱歉
- An attempt at humor, I suppose? - I'm sorry.

452
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,610
你知道嗎 我算了算...
You know, I counted the floors...

453
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,300
這棟大樓的樓層
to this building from the street.

454
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,890
- 怎樣? - 少了一層樓
- And? - There's one missing.

455
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,600
我們會深入檢查
We'll look into it.

456
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,430
一個房間 住一晚
One room. One night.

457
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,120
- 總共26美金 - 好的
- That'll be $26. - Alrighty.

458
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,470
整個晚上你都在嗎?
You on all night?

459
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,500
是 先生
Yes, sir,

460
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,770
我到明天十點鐘才下班
I'll be right here till 10:00 in the morning.

461
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,600
這是給你的
This here's for you.

462
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,870
我不會要你做非法的事情
Now, I ain't asking you to do anything illegal.

463
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,970
有個人一直在找我 不是警察
There's someone who been looking for me. Not police.

464
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,780
若是有人晚上來住宿 請立刻告訴我
You just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.

465
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,050
任何人 不管是任何人來住宿都要
And by anyone, I mean any swinging dick.

466
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,690
絕對不可能
There just ain't no way.

467
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,930
別擔心 我不會傷害你
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

468
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,840
我需要你載我離開這
I need you to drive me on outta here.

469
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:40,190
- 為什麼不? - 我不知道 哥們
- Why not? - I don't know, man.

470
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,980
你遇到車禍了嗎?
Were you in a car accident?

471
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,290
我用500美金買你的外套
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

472
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,120
錢給我看一下
Lemme see the money.

473
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,660
你遇到車禍了嗎?
Were you in a car accident?

474
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:22,370
- 是的 - 給我錢
- Yeah. - OK, give me the money.

475
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,410
錢就在這 給我外套

476

477
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,680
給你
Give it here.

478
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,690
啤酒也給我
Gimme that beer too.

01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,190
多少錢?
How much?

480
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:50,730
布來恩 啤酒給他
Brian, give him the beer.

481
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,360
醫院...
Medico...

482
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,630
...請幫我
...por favor.

483
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,490
守在這!
Wait up!

484
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,970
有那些車輛的新發現嗎?
Any word on those vehicles yet?

485
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:16,080
警長 我發現所有事情 都等待我們去調查
Sheriff, I found out everything there was to find.

486
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,000
那些車輛...
Those vehicles are titled...

487
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,720
都登記在死人名下
and registered to deceased people.

488
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:23,280
那輛飆馬車車主已經死了二十年了
The owner of that Bronco's been dead 20 years.

489
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,590
你要我去查其他那些墨西哥人嗎?
Want me to find out about the Mexican ones?

490
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,460
不了 不用
No. Lord, no.

491
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,590
這是這個月的支票
There's this month's checks.

492
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,900
緝毒署的探員又打電話來了
That DEA agent called again.

493
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,130
你還是不跟他們談嗎?
You don't wanna talk to him?

494
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,900
我會試著盡我所能撐著
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

495
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,900
他要再次去現場 他問你...
Going back. Wanted to know...

496
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,970
是否要跟他一起去
if you wanted to go with him.

497
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,270
他是衷心的說
That's cordial of him.

498
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,870
你可以幫我打電話給洛蕾塔
Can I get you to call Loretta,

499
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:47,640
告訴他我要去奧德薩市 去找卡拉·珍·摩斯?
tell her I'm going to Odessa to see Carla Jean Moss?

500
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,710
- 是的 警長 - 我到了 再打電話給她
- Yes, sheriff. - I'll call her when I get there.

501
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,700
我本現在就可以打
I'd call now,

502
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,520
可是她會要我回家
but if she want me to come home, I might.

503
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,390
你要我等你 等到你離開這媔?
Do you want me to wait till you quit the building?

504
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,320
非到萬不得已
Don't wanna lie without...

505
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,190
絕對不要說謊話
what it's absolutely necessary.

506
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,290
托伯特說過的 真理與正義的意義是什麼?
What is it Torbert says about truth and justice?

507
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,500
喔 我們每天自我反省一次
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.

508
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,000
好像這樣吧
Something like that.

509
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:14,100
我想 我將要每天自我反省兩次
I'm gonna commence dedicating myself twice daily.

510
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,010
在事情結束之前 也許還會反省個三次
Might come to three before it's over.

511
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,810
怎麼回事?
What the hell?

512
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,020
警長?
Sheriff?

513
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,620
最近你有檢查過載運的物品嗎?
You looked at your load lately?

514
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,460
這已經違規了
That is a damn outrage.

515
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,730
有一條繩子的結鬆了
One of those tie-downs worked loose.

516
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,200
你原本運載了幾具屍體?
How many bodies did you leave with?

517
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,100
我一具也沒有丟失呀 警長
I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

518
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:46,540
你們就不能用有蓋貨車來載運嗎?
Couldn't y'all have taken a van out there?

519
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:48,980
因為沒有一部四輪傳動的貨車
We didn't have no van with four-wheel drive.

520
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:51,740
你會開給我貨物捆綁不牢的罰單嗎?
You gonna write me up for improperly secured load?

521
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,720
你快給我滾吧
You get your ass outta here.

522
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,120
你好 早安
Buenos dias.

523
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:01,990
我在想 這應該不是...
I'm guessing this isn't...

524
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,790
你曾經想過的樣子吧
the future you had pictured for yourself

525
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,460
當你第一眼見到那些錢的時候
when you first clapped eyes on that money.

526
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,660
別擔心 我不是那個要追殺你的人
Don't worry. I'm not the man who's after you.

527
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,970
我知道
I know that.

528
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:15,460
我見過他
I've seen him.

529
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,870
你見過他? 而且你沒有死?
You've seen him? And you're not dead?

530
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,110
嗯
Huh.

531
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:23,940
那傢伙是怎樣的 超級壞蛋嗎?
What's this guy supposed to be, the ultimate badass?

532
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:26,110
不要認為我會這樣形容他
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

533
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,050
那你怎樣形容他?
How would you describe him?

534
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,320
我想我會說他沒有幽默感
I guess I'd say he doesn't have a sense of humor.

535
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:34,950
- 他叫做希格爾 - 修格?
- His name's Chigurh. - Sugar?

536
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,490
希格爾 安通·希格爾
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

537
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,220
你知道他怎樣找到你嗎?
You know how he found you?

538
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,890
我知道他怎樣找到我的
Yeah, I know how he found me.

539
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,560
那是個發訊機
It's called a transponder.

540
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,160
我知道那是什麼
I know what it's called.

541
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:46,930
- 他不再會找到我了 - 不會用那種方式
- He won't find me again. - Not that way.

542
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,840
- 不會用任何方式 - 花了我大約三個小時
- Not any way. - Took me about three hours.

543
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:52,240
嗯 這期間我一直動不了
Yeah, well, I been immobile.

544
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,570
不 你不瞭解
No. You don't understand.

545
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,180
- 你的職業是什麼? - 我退休了
- What do you do? - I'm retired.

547
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,350
- 電焊? 水下焊接? 不袗焊? - 都算是
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig? - Any of it.

548
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,950
- 只要是能焊接的 我都行 - 鑄鐵?
- If it can be welded, I can weld it. - Cast iron?

549
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,820
- 可以 - 我不是說銅焊
- Yeah. - I don't mean braze.

550
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:11,830
- 我沒說銅焊 - 銅鉛合金?
- I didn't say braze. - Pot metal?

551
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,360
我不是說過了嗎?
What did I say?

552
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:19,630
- 你有去過越南? - 是的 我有
- Were you in 'Nam? - Yeah, I was 'Nam.

553
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,500
我也有
So was I.

554
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:25,910
所以 這能說明什麼 我是你兄弟?
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

555
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:30,110
聽著 你得把錢給我
Look, you gotta give me this money.

556
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,710
我沒有理由再保護你了
I got no other reason to protect you.

557
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:36,480
太遲了 我花完了
It's too late. I spent it.

558
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:39,850
150萬在酒與色上
A million and a half on whores and whiskey,

559
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,690
剩下的全花在了這個醫院
and the rest of it, I just sorta blew it in.

560
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,030
你怎麼知道他不會去奧德薩市?
How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa?

561
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:55,140
- 他為何要去奧德薩市? - 去殺你老婆
- Why would he go to Odessa? - Kill your wife.

562
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,650
或許他才是那個...
Maybe he's the one that needs to be worried...

563
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:06,850
要擔心我的人
about me.

564
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,580
他不是的
He isn't.

565
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:12,280
你還是沒搞清楚
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

566
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,100
你只是個剛好路過
You're just a guy...

567
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,850
發現那些車子的傢伙
who happened to find those vehicles.

568
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,960
我住在河對岸的老鷹旅館
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

569
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,470
卡爾森·威爾斯
Carson Wells.

570
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,530
當你想通了 記得找我
Call me when you've had enough.

571
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:32,580
我甚至可以讓你保有少部份錢
I can even let you keep a little of the money.

572
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,340
要談交易的話
If I was into cutting deals,

573
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,040
我何不直接跟希格爾交易就好了?
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

574
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,330
不 不 你不明白
No, no, you don't understand.

575
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,550
你沒法跟他談交易
You can't make a deal with him.

576
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,500
即使你還他錢
Even if you gave him the money,

577
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,420
他還是會殺了你 只因為你造成的種種不便
he'd still kill you for inconveniencing him.

578
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,680
他是個特殊的人
He's a peculiar man.

579
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,000
也可說是有原則的人
Might even say he has principles,

580
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,860
他處理金錢 毒品...
principles that transcend money or drugs

581
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:56,590
所有事情 都是一樣的原則 他不像你
or anything like that. Not like you.

582
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,870
是的 他甚至也不像我
Yeah. He's not even like me.

583
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,730
他說話沒你多
No, he don't talk as much as you.

584
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,530
這點我比較欣賞他
I give him points for that.

585
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,540
卡拉·珍 很感謝你能來
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

586
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,380
不知道為何要來
Don't know why I did.

587
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:13,380
我說過 我不知道他在哪
I told you, I don't know where he is.

588
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,780
- 你連他的消息也沒有? - 一點也沒有
- You haven't heard from him? - No, I ain't.

589
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,650
- 什麼都沒有? - 一句話也沒有
- Nothing? - Not word one.

590
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,200
有了他的消息 你會告訴我嗎?
Would you tell me if you had?

591
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,920
嗯 我不知道
Well, I don't know.

592
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:24,410
他不需要因你再惹麻煩
He don't need any trouble from you.

593
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:26,830
惹他麻煩的人不是我
It ain't me he's in trouble with.

594
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,690
那又是誰?
Who's he in trouble with then?

595
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:30,490
一些壞蛋
Some pretty bad people.

596
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:32,430
這些壞蛋會殺死他
These people will kill him,

597
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:34,300
卡拉·珍 他們不會停手
Carla Jean. They won't quit.

598
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:37,400
他也不會 他從不放棄
He won't neither. He never has.

599
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,540
他來者不懼
He can take all comers.

600
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:44,920
你聽過住在山德森...
You know Charlie Walser's got...

601
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,740
東部地區的查理·華瑟嗎?
that place out east of Sanderson?

602
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:51,000
你知道他如何宰牛嗎?
You know how he used to slaughter beeves,

603
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,610
先用大木槌敲暈...
hit 'em right there with a maul,

604
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,520
綁起來之後 再切斷喉嚨
truss 'em and slit their throats?

605
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:56,170
曾經查理把一隻牛五花大綁
Charlie's got one all trussed up,

606
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:57,750
準備把它力氣耗盡...
all set to drain him...

607
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:00,130
這隻牛到處翻跳扭動
and the beef comes to, thrashing around.

608
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,730
那可是有六百磅種的畜生啊
Six hundred pounds of very pissed off livestock.

609
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,390
原諒我的措辭... 然而...
You'll excuse the... Well...

610
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:09,030
查理抓起槍對準發狂的牛的頭部射
Charlie grabs a gun, shoot the thing in the head,

611
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,000
但是 那隻牛四處搖晃 亂衝亂跳
but with the swinging and thrashing,

612
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,130
並沒射中
it's a glance shot.

613
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:14,840
子彈反彈射傷了查理的肩膀
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

614
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:15,720
你去看看查理
You go see Charlie,

615
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:18,540
現在的他仍然無法舉起右手拿帽子
he still can't pick up his right hand for his hat.

616
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,600
我想說的是
The point being,

617
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,850
即使是牛與人的競賽...
that even in the contest between man and steer,

618
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,720
結果也不是一定的
the issue is not certain.

619
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,730
奧萊溫利打給你時
When Llewelyn calls,

620
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,060
請告訴他 我會保護他的安全
just tell him I can make him safe.

621
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,270
當然 今天屠宰牛的方法...
'Course, they slaughter steers...

622
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:45,640
大不相同了
a lot different these days.

623
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:48,000
使用空氣槍 射出一塊小石子
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod...

624
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,810
只能進到腦部那麼深
about that far under the brain.

625
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,100
然後吸出來
Sucks right back in.

626
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,010
畜生永遠不知道被什麼射中
Animal never knows what hit him.

627
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:58,200
你告訴我這些要做什麼 警長?
Why are you telling me that, sheriff?

628
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,750
我不知道
I don't know.

629
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,120
我有點失神了
My mind wanders.

630
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,540
哈囉 卡爾森
Hello, Carson.

631
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:34,440
我們去你房間
Let's go to your room.

632
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,360
我們不需要這樣
You don't have to do this.

633
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:53,460
我只是一個投機者 可以現在就打道回府
I'm a day trader. I could just go home.

634
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,270
- 你可以 - 我會讓你感到值得
- You could. - Make it worth your while,

635
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:02,540
帶你去提款機 還有一千四百塊
take you to an ATM. There's 14 grand in it.

636
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:04,940
然後 大家各走各的
And everybody just walks away.

637
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,380
提款機
An ATM.

638
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,480
我知道提箱在哪
I know where the satchel is.

639
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,820
你要是知道 一定會帶在身邊
If you knew, you would have it with you.

640
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:20,500
我能在河岸找到
I can find it from the river bank.

641
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:21,800
我知道它在哪
I know where it is.

642
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:26,270
- 我知道一些更好的 - 什麼?
- I know something better. - What's that?

643
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,830
它將會在哪
Where it's going to be.

644
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:33,000
- 哪? - 它會被帶到我這
- Where's that? - It will be brought to me

645
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,570
放在我的腳邊
and placed at my feet.

646
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:40,380
你根本不確定
You don't know to a certainty.

647
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:43,000
二十分鐘之內它就可以在這
In 20 minutes it could be here.

648
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,410
我確定我知道
I do know to a certainty.

649
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:47,180
你知道接下來會怎樣嗎 卡爾森?
And you know what's gonna happen now, Carson?

650
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:50,570
你得承認你現在的情勢
You should admit your situation.

651
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:52,890
接下來將會更莊重
There would be more dignity in it.

652
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:00,870
你去下地獄吧
You go to hell.

653
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,970
好吧 我問你件事情
All right. Let me ask you something.

654
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:11,540
假使你遵循的法則 將你帶到這
If the rule you followed brought you to this,

655
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:14,210
那麼法則又有何用?
of what use was the rule?

656
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:23,690
你知道你有多瘋狂嗎?
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

657
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,230
你是說 我們這段對話的內容嗎?
You mean the nature of this conversation?

658
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:29,460
我是說你這個人
I mean the nature of you.

659
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:39,610
你...你可以擁有這些錢 安通
You... You can have the money, Anton.

660
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,050
- 哈囉? - 是的?
- Hello? - Yes?

661
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,950
呃 卡爾森·威爾斯在嗎?
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

662
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:31,680
從你的角度來說是不在了
Not in the sense that you mean.

663
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:37,860
- 你必須來見我 - 你是誰?
- You need to come see me. - Who is this?

664
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:40,930
你知道我是誰
You know who it is.

665
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,580
你該跟我談談
You need to talk to me.

666
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,170
我不需要跟你談
I don't need to talk to you.

667
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,570
我想你需要
I think you do.

668
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,370
你知道我要去哪媔?
Do you know where I'm going?

669
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,040
我不管你要去哪
Why would I care where you're going?

670
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:53,780
我知道你在哪
I know where you are.

671
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:56,050
是嗎? 我在哪?
Yeah, where am I?

672
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,250
你在河對岸的醫院
You're in the hospital across the river,

673
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,390
但我不是要去那
but that's not where I'm going.

674
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:03,380
你知道我要去哪嗎?
Do you know where I'm going?

675
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:09,260
- 是的 我知道你要去哪 - 好的
- Yeah, I know where you're going. - All right.

676
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:10,890
你知道 她不會在那堣F
You know she won't be there.

677
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:13,440
她在不在那堣ㄜ垠n
It doesn't make any difference where she is.

678
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,660
那麼 你去那邊要做什麼?
So, what're you going up there for?

679
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:21,830
你知道事情會怎樣進行下去 對嗎?
You know how this is gonna turn out, don't you?

680
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:25,340
不
Nope.

681
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,680
我想你知道 所以我的提議是這樣的
I think you do. So this is what I'll offer.

682
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:33,250
你帶錢來 我讓她走
You bring me the money, and I'll let her go.

683
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,990
否則她就跟你一樣 要對事情負責
Otherwise, she's accountable, the same as you.

684
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,500
這將是你最好的選擇了
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

685
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:45,000
我不說你可以拯救自己
I won't tell you you can save yourself,

686
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,500
因為你做不到
because you can't.

687
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:53,210
是呀 我該帶些東西給你的
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something, all right.

688
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,440
我決定給你個特殊計劃
Decided to make you a project of mine.

689
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:58,170
你根本用不著來找我
You ain't gonna have to come look for me at all.

690
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,050
- 爾德媔曭漁館? - 是 長官
- The motel in Del Rio? - Yes, sir.

691
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,880
三個死者都沒有身份
None of the three had ID on 'em,

692
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,840
但是他們告訴我 三個都是墨西哥人
but they're tellin' me that all three is Mexican...

693
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:10,720
曾經是墨西哥人
was Mexicans.

694
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,500
有個問題
There's a question,

695
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,660
他們會停手嗎? 何時停手?
whether they stopped being and when.

696
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,600
是 長官
Yes, sir.

697
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:22,260
溫道爾 你查過那個鎖頭了嗎?
Wendell, did you inquire about the lock cylinder?

698
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,970
- 是 長官 是整個被衝出去的 - 很好
- Yes, sir. It was punched out. - OK.

699
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:27,000
你要過去看看麼?
Wanna drive out there?

700
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,800
不 我該查的就是如此了
No, that's all I had to look for,

701
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,400
看起來他們都是自然死亡
it sound like these boys died of natural causes.

702
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,450
怎麼會 警長?
How's that, sheriff?

703
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:35,420
就跟他們日常的工作一樣而已
Natural to the line of work they in.

704
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,350
- 是 長官 - 天啊 溫道爾 這簡直是全面戰爭
- Yes, sir. - My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

705
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,600
我想不出其他形容詞了
I can't think of any other word for it.

706
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,410
這些傢伙是誰?
Who are these people?

707
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,220
這婸﹞W周...
Here, last week they found...

708
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:45,950
他們發現一對夫婦
this couple out in California.

709
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:47,890
在加州 他們將房間出租給老人
They rent out rooms to old people,

710
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:49,760
殺了他們 將他們埋在院子
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,

711
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:52,130
再將他們的社會福利金支票兌現
cash their Social Security checks.

712
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:56,330
他們先折磨被害人 我不知道為什麼
Oh, they'd torture 'em first. I don't know why.

713
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:59,630
也許他們的電視機壞了
Maybe their television set was broke.

714
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:03,080
這件事一直持續到 這塈琩茪犍峇@下:
And this went on until, here, I quote,

715
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:05,000
"當一個只套著套狗項圈的男人...
"Neighbors were alerted...

716
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,050
從屋媔]出來時
when a man ran from the premises

717
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,110
鄰居們才發覺了事情的異常"
wearing only a dog collar."

718
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:12,800
這種事情 你一定編不出來
You can't make up such a thing as that.

719
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,850
我敢保證
I dare you to try.

720
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,000
但你要注意 那就是有效果
But that's what it took, you notice,

721
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,620
引起人們的注意
to get somebody's attention.

722
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,420
在後院挖墳墓卻不會有如此效果
Digging graves in the backyard didn't bring any.

723
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:30,870
沒關係 有時候我也會一個人傻笑
Well, that's all right. I laugh myself sometimes.

724
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,000
你能做的事情 其實不多
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

725
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:39,610
說說看
Tell me something.

726
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,670
你覺得 誰可以經由這個門進入美國?
Who gets through this gate into the United States?

727
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:46,980
我不知道 美國公民?
I don't know. American citizens?

728
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:49,960
某些美國公民 你覺得誰可以決定?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?

729
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,020
- 嗯 你可以 我猜 - 沒錯
- You do, I reckon. - That is correct.

730
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,390
- 我如何決定? - 我不知道
- How do I decide? - I don't know.

731
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:57,200
我問問題 我若是得到滿意回答
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers,

732
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,400
他們就能進入美國
then they get to go to America.

733
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,830
若不滿意 他們就不可以通過
If I don't, they don't.

734
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,960
- 關於那還有什麼不明白的嗎? - 沒有 長官
- Anything you don't understand? - No.

735
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:02,900
那我再問你一次
I ask again,

736
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,700
你怎麼沒穿衣服出現在這?
how you come to be here with no clothes?

737
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:07,670
我有穿外套啊
Well, I got an overcoat on.

738
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,880
- 你在耍我嗎? - 喔 沒有 長官

August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

744

745
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,180
找人來幫這位先生
Get someone to help this man.

746
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,960
他需要進城

747

她不想跟你說話
She don't want to talk to you.

753
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,600
不 她想的 讓她聽
Yes, she does. Put her on.

754
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:14,200
- 你知道現在幾點鐘嗎? - 我不管現在幾點

01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:34,340
好的 謝謝 我又老又病
Yes, thank you. I am old and I am not well!

811
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:36,000
你們要搭哪部巴士?
Which bus are you taking?

812
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,110
我們要去愛爾帕索 別問我原因
Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

813
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:42,120
很少見到墨西哥人穿西裝
It's not often you see a Mexican in a suit.

814
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,800
你要去愛爾帕索? 我知道那
You go to El Paso? I know it.

815
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,740
你們要待在哪?
Where are you staying?

816
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,120
哦...
Oh...

817
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:47,950
卡拉·珍 還好嗎?
Carla Jean, how are you?

818
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:52,020
警長 查理·華瑟的故事是真的嗎?
Sheriff, was that a true story about Charlie Walser?

819
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:54,590
查理·華瑟是誰? 啊! 哦...
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

820
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:56,760
嗯...
Um...

821
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:59,390
是真的 細節我不敢保證
True story. I couldn't swear to every detail,

822
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:02,000
但那的確是一個故事
but it's certainly true it is a story.

823
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
嗯 好吧
Yeah, right.

824
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:06,910
警長 你可以給我個保證嗎?
Sheriff, can you give me your word on something?

825
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:08,910
可以的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

826
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:11,900
要是我告訴你奧萊溫利要去哪
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,

827
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,610
請答應我 只有你...
you promise it'll be just you...

828
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,850
去找他 跟他談? 只有你
who goes and talks with him? You and nobody else.

829
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,300
當然 我保證
Yes, ma'am, I do.

830
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,860
奧萊溫利從不會求助他人
Llewelyn would never ask for help.

831
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,790
他從不覺得需要幫助
He never thinks he needs any.

832
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:27,760
卡拉·珍 我絕不會傷害你的丈夫
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

833
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:31,270
況且他需要幫助 不管他知道否
And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.

834
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:42,300
兄弟 什麼問題?
What's the problem there, neighbor?

835
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:46,750
那會失去些動力 過度使用
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

836
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:50,430
你住附近嗎?
You from around here?

837
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,320
我從出生就再這
Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

838
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:56,450
- 可以了 - 你會用哪個機場?
- Here you go. - What airport would you use?

839
01:33:56,530 --> 01:34:00,720
- 機場還是小型飛機場? - 機場
- Well, airport or airstrip? - Airport.

840
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,560
- 嗯 你要去哪? - 我不知道
- Well, where you goin'? - I don't know.

841
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:07,500
只是到處跑 嗯?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh?

842
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,090
兄弟 我也曾經如此
Brother, I been there.

843
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,870
嗯 有一個小型機場
Well, there's airstrips.

844
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:15,270
機場在愛爾帕索
The airport is El Paso.

845
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,140
若是要去比較特殊的地方
If you want someplace specific,

846
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,400
最好開車去...
you might could be better off...

847
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,170
達拉斯 就不用轉機了
just driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

848
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,450
兄弟 你不把它夾上去麼?
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

849
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,420
你可以將那些雞籠子從車上弄走麼?
Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed?

850
01:34:26,490 --> 01:34:29,360
你在說些什麼啊?
What are you talking about?

851
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:49,270
嘿 體育用品先生
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

852
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:53,300
- 嘿 你好 - 你是運動員?
- Hey, yourself. - You a sport?

853
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:55,780
是的
Yeah, that's me.

854
01:34:55,850 --> 01:34:58,650
我房間埵陸鈰s
I got beers in my room.

855
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:02,620
- 哦 呃 我...我在等我妻子 - 哦
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife. - Oh.

856
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:05,530
難怪你一直往窗外望?
That's who you keep looking out the window for?

857
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:08,220
- 猜對一半 - 那另一半原因呢?
- Well, half. - What else then?

858
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:13,130
- 看看有什麼情況 - 是啊
- Just looking for what's comin'. - Yeah.

859
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,900
但是沒有人可以預見沒發生的事
But no one ever sees that.

860
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:19,270
啤酒 就是接下來的事
Beer! That's what's comin'.

861
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,140
我會將冰桶拿來這 你可以繼續保持你的婚姻
I'll bring the ice chest out. You can stay married.

862
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:24,700
不了 女士 我知道 啤酒會帶來什麼
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

863
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:28,680
啤酒會只會帶來更多啤酒
Beer leads to more beer.

864
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,070
你還好麼?
You all right?

865
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,200
快報警
Call the police.

866
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,310
通知這堛瘧給
Your local law enforcement.

867
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:35,640
我的無線電頻率不同
I'm not on their radio.

868
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:38,450
我見到了他的女兒...
I met his daughter at the...

869
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:29,100
你回家前 我可以請你喝杯咖啡嗎?
Buy you a cup of coffee 'fore you drive home?

870
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:30,950
錢沒在他房間?
No money in his room there?

871
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:32,730
他身上有幾百塊錢
Couple hundred, on his person.

872
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:35,140
那些西班牙人可能將錢藏起來了
Those hombres would have taken the stash.

873
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:37,770
我猜是這樣
I suppose so.

874
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:40,010
雖然他們來去匆匆
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

875
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,680
一切都因為那錢而起 愛德·湯姆
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.

876
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,280
金錢和毒品
Money and the drugs.

877
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,120
超乎其他所有事情
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

878
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:53,090
那代表什麼? 它又會帶來什麼後果?
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

879
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:56,220
你知道麼 要是你二十年前告訴我
You know, if you'd have told me 20 years ago

880
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:59,430
現在的我會看到在德州的城
I'd see children walking the streets of our Texas towns

881
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,630
孩子們染者綠色頭髮 穿著鼻環走來走去
with green hair, bones in their noses,

882
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,270
我只是直截了當地不相信你
I just flat-out wouldn't have believed you.

883
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,900
神跡奇事
Signs and wonders.

884
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:08,800
但我認為一旦不尊稱人們...
But I think once you quit hearing...

885
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,540
"先生"與"女士" 其他的壞事很快會接踵而來
"sir" and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

886
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:13,340
- 喔 那就是潮流 - 是啊
- Oh, it's the tide. - Yeah.

887
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:17,250
令人悲傷的潮流 還不只是這樣
It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.

888
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,910
不只是這樣而已
Not the one thing.

889
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:21,860
然而 那都不足以解釋 你要逮捕的那個人
Yeah, well, none of that explains your man, though.

890
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,050
他只是一個嗜殺成性的瘋子 愛德·湯姆
Well, he's just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

891
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:26,810
我不確定他是一個瘋子
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.

892
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:28,490
嗯 那你覺得他是什麼?
Well, what would you call him?

893
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,930
嗯 有時我甚至覺得他像個鬼魂
Well, sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.

894
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,940
- 他是真實的 好麼? - 是嗎?
- He's real, all right. - Oh, yeah?

895
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,880
是的 在老鷹旅館發生的事情
Yeah. All of that over at the Eagle Hotel?

896
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:37,770
超乎想像
Just beyond everything.

897
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,400
是啊 他有些無情
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

898
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,380
幾乎不能這麼說
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

899
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,410
有天 他射殺了旅館櫃檯人員
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

900
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,730
走回來又接著...
walks right back in the next...

901
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:50,980
射殺了一個退役陸軍上校
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

902
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,540
真是難以置信
It's hard to believe.

903
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:55,890
最後還回到犯罪現場
Just strolls right back into a crime scene.

904
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,640
有誰會做這樣的事情?
Now, who'd do such a thing?

905
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:01,330
你又能怎樣防範?
How do you defend against it?

906
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:04,390
旅途平安 愛德·湯姆
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

907
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:06,870
很抱歉我們沒能幫他
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

908
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:42,210
- 我在後面! - 你怎知道我在這?
- In back! - How'd you know I was here?

909
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:45,380
誰會開你那輛車?
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

910
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:47,010
- 你聽見了? - 如何?
- You heard it? - How's that?

911
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:51,290
你聽說過我的事 你在取笑我嗎?
Did you hear my? You're having fun with me.

912
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,540
你怎會這樣子想呢?
What give you that idea?

913
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,730
我看到其中一隻貓聽見車聲
I seen one of the cats heard it.

914
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,200
但你怎麼知道那是我的車?
How'd you know it was my truck?

915
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,600
當你走進來的時候我推論的
I deduced it when you walked in.

916
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:02,830
那些你現在有幾隻?
How many of them things you got now?

917
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:05,430
貓? 我不知道 好幾隻吧
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

918
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:08,810
嗯 得看你說的"有"是什麼意思了
Well, it depends on what you mean by "got."

919
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,990
有些是半野生的
Some of 'em are half wild,

920
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:13,110
也有些是野貓
some of 'em are just outlaws.

921
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,920
- 還好嗎 埃奡? - 你這不是見到了
- How you been, Ellis? - You're looking at it.

922
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:24,590
我要說你看起來老了許多
I got to say, you're looking older.

923
01:43:24,660 --> 01:43:26,180
我的確老了
I am older.

924
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:29,800
我收到了你老婆的信
Got a letter from your wife.

925
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:32,080
她經常寫信給我
She writes me pretty regular,

926
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:34,300
讓我知道些家堛漁灡
keeps me up on the family news.

927
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:36,220
我不知道有什麼消息
Didn't know there was any.

928
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:38,070
她說你要辭職了
Told me you're quittin'.

929
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:44,040
- 要喝一杯麼? - 謝謝
- You want a cup? - Appreciate it.

930
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:53,380
這咖啡放了多久了?
How fresh is that coffee?

931
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,320
通常我每周煮一次
I generally make a fresh pot every week,

932
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,190
即使有剩下的
even if there's some left over.

933
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:03,460
那個槍殺你的死在牢堣F
That man that shot you died in prison?

934
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:08,060
安哥拉 是的
Angola. Yeah.

935
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:10,930
若是他被釋放出來 你會怎麼做?
What'd you done he'd a been released?

936
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:13,910
我不知道  什麼也不會做
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

937
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,600
我也從來沒想過
Wouldn't be no point in it.

938
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,940
我真的驚訝你會這麼說
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

939
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:22,750
嗯 當你試圖拿回...
Well, all the time you spend trying to get back

940
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:24,650
失去的東西的時候
what's been took from you,

941
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:26,480
也將會失去更多
more is going out the door.

942
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,500
不久之後
After a while,

943
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,520
你就只會試著綁條止血帶
you have to try to get a tourniquet on it.

944
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:34,720
你祖父從未要求我 要我擔任副警長
Your granddad never asked me to sign on as a deputy.

945
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:40,000
洛蕾塔說你要辭職了
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.

946
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,560
為何要辭職?
How come you doing that?

947
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,940
我不知道
I don't know.

948
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,300
我感到心力交瘁
I feel overmatched.

949
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,480
我總是想 當我老了
I always figured when I got older,

950
01:44:55,550 --> 01:45:00,450
上帝會用某種方式進入我心中
God would... sort of come into my life somehow.

951
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:04,520
他沒有
And He didn't.

952
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,020
我也不會怪上帝
And I don't blame Him.

953
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,400
換作我是他
If I was Him,

954
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,340
我也會是一樣的看法
I'd have the same opinion of me that He does.

955
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:17,770
你不會知道上帝想些什麼
You don't know what He thinks.

956
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,850
我將麥克叔叔的警徽與臂章...
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge...

957
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:35,720
送到巡警署
over to the Rangers,

958
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:38,420
放到了博物館
put it in their museum.

959
01:45:38,490 --> 01:45:40,300
你爸爸告訴過你...
Your daddy ever tell you...

960
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:42,120
麥克叔叔如何得到勳章的嗎?
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

961
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:46,760
在哈得斯佩斯郡的家門口 被槍殺倒地
Gunned down on his own porch over in Hudspeth County.

962
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,430
共有七八個人
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,

963
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:53,870
想要這 想要那
all wanting this, wanting that.

964
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:56,910
麥克叔叔走進屋子去拿出散彈鎗
Uncle Mac went back in the house to get the shotgun.

965
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:00,610
他們比他快一步
Well, they was ahead of him.

966
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:03,410
在門口把他殺死了
Shot him in his doorway.

967
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:06,080
愛拉姑姑出來想要止住流血
Aunt Ella come out, tried to stop the bleeding.

968
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:10,090
麥克叔叔還在想要拿他的散彈鎗
Uncle Mac all the while trying to get that shotgun.

969
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,800
他們就坐在馬上
They just sat there on their horses,

970
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,600
看著他死去
watching him die.

971
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:16,780
稍後...
After a while,

972
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:19,860
其中一個人說了些印第安話 他們才轉身
one of 'em said something in Indian and they turned.

973
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:22,570
離開
Left out.

974
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:28,230
嗯 麥克叔叔知道狀況的危險 即使愛拉姑姑沒有意識到
Uncle Mac knew the score, even if Aunt Ella didn't.

975
01:46:28,310 --> 01:46:31,440
子彈射穿左肺
Shot through the left lung.

976
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:36,040
事情就是那樣 就如他們說的
And that was that... as they say.

977
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:40,620
他何時死的?
When'd he die?

978
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:45,260
190...9年
Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?

979
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:49,160
不 我是說立刻還是晚上 還是...
No, I mean, was it right away or in the night or...

980
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:52,930
- 什麼時候? - 我想是當天晚上
- When was it? - I believe it was that night.

981
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,510
她隔天早上就把他埋葬了
She buried him the next morning.

982
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:58,030
在那硬硬的黏土層用力挖掘
Digging in that hard old caliche.

983
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:03,740
你聽到的並不是什麼新鮮事
What you got ain't nothin' new.

984
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,580
這國家對待人民很苛刻
This country is hard on people.

985
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,450
對於將要發生的事情 你也無法阻擋
You can't stop what's coming.

986
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,320
沒有人會拜訪你
It ain't all waitin' on you.

987
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,030
一切都是空虛的
That's vanity.

988
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,320
我知道這事情還沒了結
I knew this wasn't done with.

989
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,060
我沒拿到那些錢
I ain't got the money.

990
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,210
我身邊的錢也所剩無幾
What little I had is long gone...

991
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:36,330
很多帳單沒付
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

992
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:40,530
今天才埋葬了我母親
I buried my mother today.

993
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:42,800
喪葬費用也還沒付
Ain't paid for that neither.

994
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:45,680
我不擔心那個
I wouldn't worry about it.

995
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,870
我要坐下來
I need to sit down.

996
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:07,260
你沒有理由傷害我
You got no cause to hurt me.

997
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:11,170
沒有 但我承諾過
No. But I gave my word.

998
01:49:12,610 --> 01:49:16,240
- 你承諾過? - 對你丈夫
- You gave your word? - To your husband.

999
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:22,010
沒有道理啊
That don't make sense.

1000
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,310
你對我丈夫承諾過要殺我?
You gave your word to my husband to kill me?

1001
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:28,880
你丈夫原本有機會救你
Your husband had the opportunity to save you.

1002
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,820
可是 他利用你 想要救他自己
Instead, he used you to try to save himself.

1003
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:38,820
不是那樣
Not like that.

1004
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,230
不是你說的那樣
Not like you say.

1005
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:50,110
你不需要這樣做
You don't have to do this.

1006
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:52,440
人們都是這樣說
People always say the same thing.

1007
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:55,440
說些什麼?
What do they say?

1008
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:58,780
人們都說:"你不需要這樣做"
They say, "You don't have to do this."

1009
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:05,020
- 你不必這樣 - 好吧
- You don't. - OK.

1010
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:12,120
這是我能做得最好的事
This is the best I can do.

1011
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:14,220
猜吧
Call it.

1012
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:22,340
我看你坐在那邊的時候 我就知道你瘋了
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you sitting there.

1013
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:27,370
我很確認我知道要發生的事情
I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

1014
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:31,780
- 猜吧 - 不
- Call it. - No.

1015
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:34,380
我不會猜的
I ain't gonna call it.

1016
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,160
猜吧
Call it.

1017
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:42,290
這硬幣什麼也不會說
The coin don't have no say.

1018
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:44,230
只有你
It's just you.

1019
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:49,860
嗯 我來的路跟這個硬幣一樣
Well, I got here the same way the coin did.

1020
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:35,640
先生 你的骨頭裂出來了
Mister, you got a bone sticking out of your arm.

1021
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:38,110
我還好 讓我在這塈仍X分鐘
I'm all right. Let me just sit here a minute.

1022
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:41,110
救護車就在路上 是那邊的男子去打的電話
There's an ambulance coming. The man went to call.

1023
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:43,480
好的
All right.

1024
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:45,000
你還好嗎?
Are you all right?

1025
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,390
你的骨頭裂出來了
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

1026
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:50,620
你的襯衫怎麼賣?
What'll you take for the shirt?

1027
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,170
先生 我可以送給你
Well, hell, mister, I'll give you my shirt.

1028
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:08,630
看那恐怖的骨頭
Look at that fucking bone.

1029
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:09,870
幫我打個結
Tie this for me.

1030
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,950
就打個結 就打個結
Just tie it, just tie it.

1031
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:34,990
先生 聽著 我很樂於助人
Hell,mister.Look,I don't mind helping someone out.

1032
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,560
- 那可不是小錢 - 收下吧
- That's a lot of money. - Take it.

1033
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:40,770
收下 然後...你們沒見到我
Take it and... you didn't see me.

1034
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:43,110
我已經不見了
I was already gone.

1035
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:44,480
是 先生
Yes, sir.

1036
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,640
見者也有份
Part of that's mine, right?

1037
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:52,410
又不是你的襯衫
You still got your damn shirt.

1038
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:54,200
他的錢不只是要買襯衫
Ain't even what it was for.

1039
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,890
也許吧 但是是我的襯衫給了他
Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

1040
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:19,640
- 或許我要繼續騎馬 - 好吧
- Maybe I'll go ridin'. - OK.

1041
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:23,580
- 你覺得呢? - 我無法幫你計劃一天要做的事
- What do you think? - Well, I can't plan your day.

1042
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:26,610
我是說 你也想一起來嗎?
I mean, would you care to join me?

1043
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:28,380
不了 我又還沒退休
Lord, no, I'm not retired.

1044
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:34,830
- 不然我在這媕飢A - 呃...最好不要
- Maybe I'll help out here then. - Uh...better not.

1045
01:54:39,130 --> 01:54:42,470
- 睡得好嗎? - 我不知道 做了夢
- How'd you sleep? - I don't know. Had dreams.

1046
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:44,720
你現在有時間做夢了
Well, you got time for 'em now.

1047
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,910
有什麼有趣的嗎?
Anything interesting?

1048
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,810
只有當事人會有興趣
They always is to the party concerned.

1049
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:54,640
愛德·湯姆 我願洗耳恭聽
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

1050
01:54:57,090 --> 01:54:59,000
好吧 有兩段夢
All right, then. Two of 'em,

1051
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,180
都跟我爸有關 很怪
both had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

1052
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:05,250
我夢堣韖L要老20歲
I'm older now than he ever was by 20 years.

1053
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:09,190
所以 可以說他比我年輕
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

1054
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:12,360
沒關係 第一個夢記不太清楚 但...
Anyway, the first one I don't remember too well,

1055
01:55:12,430 --> 01:55:15,160
是關於在城堿Y處和他相見
but it was about meeting him in town,

1056
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:17,830
他給了我一些錢
somewheres, and he give me some money.

1057
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:19,530
我想我弄丟了
I think I lost it.

1058
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:23,000
第二個夢
Second one,

1059
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,250
我跟爸都回到舊時過去
it was like we was both back in older times.

1060
01:55:26,310 --> 01:55:28,000
某個夜晚
And I was a-horseback,

1061
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,410
我騎馬穿過山上小路
going through the mountains of a night.

1062
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:33,920
穿過山上的小徑
Going through this pass in the mountains.

1063
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:37,390
天氣很冷 地上有雪
It was cold, and there was snow on the ground.

1064
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:39,930
他騎馬超過我 繼續往前
And he rode past me and kept on going,

1065
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:42,760
什麼也沒說只是繼續往前騎
never said nothing going by, just rode on past.

1066
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,900
他從頭到腳都用毯子蓋著...
He had his blanket wrapped around him...

1067
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,200
並且頭朝下
and his head down.

1068
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,500
當他超過我身邊時
When he rode past,

1069
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:54,000
我見到他拿著一把牛角火炬
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

1070
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,980
就像從前人們一樣 而且我...
the way people used to do, and I...

1071
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,640
我從火光堨i以將牛角看的很清楚
I could see the horn from the light inside of it,

1072
01:55:58,710 --> 01:56:00,440
就跟月亮的顏色一樣
'bout the color of the moon.

1073
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:04,280
在夢 我知道他將
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

1074
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:06,950
繼續往前騎去
...going on ahead.

1075
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,200
好像他要在寒冷的黑夜...
He was fixin' to make a fire...

1076
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:12,420
到某處去生火
somewhere out there in all that dark and cold.

1077
01:56:16,030 --> 01:56:19,020
我知道 無論何時我到了那 他都會在那
