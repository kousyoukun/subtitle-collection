1
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,124
I was sheriff of this county when I was
twenty-five years old.

2
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,752
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,422
Grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

4
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,095
Me and him was sheriff at the same time,
him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,681
I think he was pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,058
I know I was.

7
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,688
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,649
A lot of folks find that
hard to believe.

9
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,276
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

10
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,318
That the younger Jim.

11
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,905
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Commanche County.

12
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,034
Now I always liked to hear about
the old-timers.

13
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,037
Never missed a chance to do so.

14
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,458
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

15
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,296
Can't help but wonder how they
would've operated these times.

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,509
There is this boy I sent to the electric
chair in Huntsville here a while back.

17
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,430
My arrest and my testimony.

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,350
He killed a fourteen-year-old girl.

19
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:46,690
Papers said it was a crime of passion but
he told me there wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,612
Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody
for about as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,655
Said if they turned him out he'd do it again.

22
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,699
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,702
Be there in about fifteen minutes.

24
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,954
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,832
I surely don't.

26
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,629
The crime you see now, it's hard
to even take its measure.

27
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,508
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,055
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,934
But I don't want to push my chips forward...

30
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,271
...and go out and meet something
I don't understand.

31
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,070
A man would have to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,740
He just have to say, okay.

33
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,704
I'll be part of this world.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,792
Yes sir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,587
Sheriff he had some sort of
thing on him like a...

36
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,257
...oxygen tanks for emphysema or something.

37
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,968
And a hose that run down his sleeve...

38
00:02:59,054 --> 00:02:59,805
You got me.

39
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,682
You'll look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,393
Yes sir, I got it under control.

41
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,576
Howdy, what's this about?

42
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,036
Step out of the car please, sir.

43
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,371
What is it?

44
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,082
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

45
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,132
What is that for?

46
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,011
Would you hold still please, sir.

47
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,418
Hold still.

48
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,849
Agua.

49
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,435
...Agua. Por Dios.

50
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,949
Agua.

51
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,245
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,800
Agua.

53
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,304
I ain't got no agua.

54
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:11,528
You speak English?

55
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,365
Where's the last guy?

56
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,534
Ultimo hombre.

57
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,369
Last man standing.
There must've been one.

58
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,078
Where'd he go?

59
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,213
I reckon I'd go out the way I came in.

60
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,340
La puerta...

61
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,384
Hay lobos...

62
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,179
Ain't no lobos.

63
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:58,617
If you stopped and watch your backtrack,
you're gonna shoot my dumb ass.

64
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,667
But if you stopped, you
stopped in the shade.

65
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,286
What's in the satchel?

66
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,329
It's full of money.

67
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,498
That'll be the day.

68
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,083
Where'd you get the pistol?

69
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,418
At the gettin' place.

70
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,921
Did you buy that gun?

71
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,672
No. I found it.

72
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,176
Welyn!

73
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:44,593
What?

74
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:45,677
Quit your hollering.

75
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,263
What'd you give for that thing?

76
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,142
You don't need to know everything, Carla Jean.

77
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,520
I need to know that.

78
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,690
You keep running that mouth of yours I'm gonna
take you in the back and screw you.

79
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,651
Big talk.

80
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:01,985
Keep it up.

81
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,947
Fine. I don't wanna know.

82
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,783
I don't even wanna know
where you been all day.

83
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:10,953
That'll work.

84
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,301
Alright.

85
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,142
Llewelyn.

86
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,519
Yeah?

87
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,147
What're you doing, baby?

88
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,233
I'm going out.

89
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,401
Going where?

90
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,612
Something I forgot to do but I'll be back.

91
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,906
What're you going to do?

92
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,577
I'm fixing to do something dumber
now but I'm going anyways.

93
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,415
If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

94
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,585
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

95
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,382
Well then. I'll tell her myself.

96
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,260
How much?

97
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,929
Sixty-nine cents.

98
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,514
And the gas.

99
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,475
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

100
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,102
What way would that be?

101
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:10,854
I seen you was from Dallas.

102
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:18,987
What business is it of yours
where I'm from, friendo?

103
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,116
I didn't mean nothing by it.

104
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,660
Didn't mean nothing.

105
00:21:24,827 --> 00:21:27,079
Just passing my time.

106
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,793
If you don't wanna accept that I don't
know what else I can do for you.

107
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,172
Will there be something else?

108
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,674
I don't know. Will there?

109
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:46,932
Is somethin wrong?

110
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:47,724
With what?

111
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:48,475
With anything?

112
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:51,520
Is that what you're asking me?

113
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,022
Is there something wrong with anything?

114
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,191
Will there be anything else?

115
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,109
You already asked me that.

116
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,323
Well... I need to see about closing.

117
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,992
See about closing.

118
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:05,576
Yes sir.

119
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,660
What time do you close?

120
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,287
Now. We close now.

121
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,079
Now is not a time.

122
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,289
What time do you close?

123
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,040
Generally around dark. At dark.

124
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,881
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

125
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:19,464
Sir?

126
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,469
I said you don't know what you're
talking about.

127
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:28,765
What time do you go to bed?

128
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:29,933
Sir?

129
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,643
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

130
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,562
I said what time do you go to bed?

131
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:39,610
Somewhere around 9:30.

132
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,154
I'd say around 9:30.

133
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,322
I could come back then.

134
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,698
Why would you be coming back?

135
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,699
We'd be closed.

136
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,658
Yeah. You said that.

137
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,704
Well... I got to close now.

138
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,247
You live in that house out back?

139
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,375
Yes I do.

140
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,711
You lived here all your life?

141
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:03,091
This is my wife's father's place. Originally.

142
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:06,803
You married into it.

143
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,182
We lived in Temple Texas for many years.

144
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,101
Raised a family there.

145
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,145
In Temple.

146
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:17,231
We come out here about four years ago.

147
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,066
You married into it.

148
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,360
If that's the way you wanna put it.

149
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,362
I don't have some way to put it.

150
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,531
That's the way it is.

151
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,250
What's the most you've ever
lost in a coin toss?

152
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,168
Sir?

153
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,463
The most you ever lost in a coin toss.

154
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,217
I don't know. I couldn't say.

155
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,179
Call it.

156
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,430
Call it?

157
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:51,056
Yes.

158
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:52,391
For what?

159
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:53,392
Just call it.

160
00:23:56,562 --> 00:24:00,190
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

161
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,233
You need to call it.

162
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,026
I can't call it for you.

163
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,112
It wouldn't be fair.

164
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,780
I didn't put nothing up.

165
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,073
Yes, you did.

166
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:10,367
You've been putting it up your whole life.

167
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,451
You just didn't know it.

168
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,580
You know what date is on this coin?

169
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:15,873
No.

170
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:16,790
1958.

171
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,918
It's been traveling twenty-two
years to get here.

172
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,420
And now it's here.

173
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,755
And it's either heads or tails.

174
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,508
And you have to say. Call it.

175
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,887
Look... I need to know what I stand to win.

176
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,013
Everything.

177
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:32,890
How's that?

178
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,100
You stand to win everything. Call it.

179
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,983
Alright. Heads then.

180
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:48,697
Well done.

181
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,992
Don't put it in your pocket.

182
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,035
Sir?

183
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,078
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

184
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,373
Where you want me to put it?

185
00:24:58,373 --> 00:24:59,583
Anywhere not in your pocket.

186
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,879
Or it'll be mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

187
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:08,926
Which it is.

188
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:21,772
Llewelyn?

189
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,651
What the hell?

190
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:28,695
Odessa.

191
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,906
Why would we go to Odessa?

192
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,867
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

193
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,536
Well, how come?

194
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,955
Right now it's midnight Sunday.

195
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,165
When the courthouse opens nine hours from now,...

196
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,585
...someone's gonna be callin' in the vehicle
number on the inspection plate on the truck.

197
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,046
And by 9:30, they'll show up here.

198
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,048
But for how long do we have to...

199
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:51,301
Baby, at what point would you quit bothering
to look for your two million dollars?

200
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,096
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

201
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,558
Try standin' in the door and holler
"Mama, I'm home".

202
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,392
Llewelyn...

203
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,309
C'mon, pack your things.

204
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,937
Anything you leave you ain't
gonna see it again.

205
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,651
Well, thanks for falling all over
and apologizing.

206
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,489
Baby, things happened.
I can't take 'em back.

207
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,097
Mind ridin', bitch?

208
00:26:50,794 --> 00:26:51,403
This his truck?

209
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:52,446
Mm-Mm.

210
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:57,826
Got a screwgie?

211
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,040
Who cut his tires?

212
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,709
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

213
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,545
That's a dead dog.

214
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:09,713
Yes, it is.

215
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:14,801
Where's the receiver?

216
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:15,969
I've got it.

217
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,097
They're ripe petunias.

218
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,975
Hold this please.

219
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,485
You want it?

220
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,155
You getting anything though?

221
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:36,990
Not a bleep.

222
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,117
Alright...

223
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:43,330
Gimme that.

224
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,801
I thought it was a car afire.

225
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:56,802
It is a car afire.

226
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,054
But Wnedell said there was
something backcountry too.

227
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,393
When is the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

228
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:05,853
I love you more and more everyday.

229
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,271
That's very nice.

230
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:09,606
Be careful.

231
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,107
Always am.

232
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:11,316
Don't get hurt.

233
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,109
Never do.

234
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,443
Don't hurt no one.

235
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:17,531
If you say so.

236
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:55,394
Wouldn't think a car would burn like that.

237
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,939
Yes sir. We should've brought weenies.

238
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,566
That look like about a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

239
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,943
It could be.

240
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:05,028
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

241
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:06,905
The old boy shot by the highway?

242
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:09,241
Yes sir, his vehicle.

243
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,911
Man killed Lamar's deputy and took his car.

244
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:14,371
Killed that man on the highway,...

245
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:15,747
...swapped for his car...

246
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:19,167
...and now here it is and he's swapped
again for god knows what.

247
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,130
That's very linear, Sheriff.

248
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:25,215
Well. Old age flattens a man.

249
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:28,844
Yes sir. But then there's this other.

250
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:32,472
You ride Winston.

251
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:34,766
- You sure?
- Oh, I'm more than sure.

252
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:37,477
Anything happens to Loretta's horse out here,...

253
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:40,439
...I can tell you right now I don't wanna be
the party that was aboard.

254
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:44,526
It's the same tire tread comin back as going.

255
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:47,904
Made about the same time too.
You can see the sipes real clear.

256
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,201
Somebodies pried the inspection
plate off the door on this one.

257
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:57,622
I know this truck.

258
00:29:57,956 --> 00:30:00,083
Belongs to a fella named Moss.

259
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:02,753
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

260
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,921
You figure him for a doperunner?

261
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:08,884
I don't know but I kindly doubt it.

262
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:11,136
OK Corral just down there.

263
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,599
Oh hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

264
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:21,355
Well this is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

265
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:25,275
Yeah, appears to have been a glitch or two.

266
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:31,073
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?

267
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:35,535
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

268
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:40,207
Somebody unloaded on that thing with a shotgun.

269
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,961
How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?

270
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:46,797
I don't know.

271
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:54,763
Supposedly coyotes won't eat a Mexican.

272
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:57,682
These boys appear to be managerial.

273
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,519
I think we're lookin at more than one fracas...

274
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,062
Execution here...

275
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:03,980
...Wild West over there

276
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:07,275
That Mexican brown dope.

277
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:09,528
These boys is all swole up.

278
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:12,489
So this was earlier, getting set to trade.

279
00:31:12,572 --> 00:31:14,950
Then, whoa, differences...

280
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,661
You know might not of even been no money.

281
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,162
That's possible.

282
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:20,997
But you don't believe it.

283
00:31:21,665 --> 00:31:24,543
No. Probably I don't.

284
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:29,881
Well, it's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?

285
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,470
If it ain't, it'll do till a mess gets here.

286
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:29,668
Yes sir?

287
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:32,629
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

288
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,756
Did you go up to his trailer?

289
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:35,632
Yes.

290
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:39,469
Well, I'd say he's at work. Do you
want to leave a message?

291
00:33:39,594 --> 00:33:40,595
Where does he work?

292
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,139
I can't say.

293
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,059
Where does he work?

294
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:50,480
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

295
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:53,316
Where does he work?

296
00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:58,822
Did you not hear me? We can't give
out no information.

297
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:22,971
Why all the way to Del Rio?

298
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:25,348
I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

299
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:26,975
You can't afford one?

300
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:29,436
I don't wanna register it.

301
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,229
Look, I'll call you in a couple days.

302
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:33,315
- Promise?
- Yes, I do.

303
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:36,318
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

304
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:38,820
Well I got a good one.
So, they ought to even out.

305
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:42,157
Quit worrying so much.

306
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,159
Mama's gonna raise hell.

307
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:46,745
She is just gonna curse you
up and down.

308
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:48,747
You should be used to that.

309
00:34:48,747 --> 00:34:51,708
I'm used to lots of things,
I work at Wal-Mart.

310
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:55,212
Not any more, Carla Jean.
You're retired.

311
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:57,881
- Llewelyn?
- Yes ma'am?

312
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:04,554
- You are comin back, ain't ya?
- I shall return.

313
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:11,311
Sheriff's Department!

314
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:14,898
Look at that lock.

315
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:18,694
We goin' in?

316
00:35:18,694 --> 00:35:20,487
Gun out and up.

317
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,202
- What about yours?
- I'm hidin behind you.

318
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:31,915
Sheriff's Department!

319
00:35:58,191 --> 00:36:00,068
I believe they've lit a shuck.

320
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,403
I believe you're right.

321
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:02,946
That from the lock?

322
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:05,032
Probably must be.

323
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,616
When was he here, Sheriff?

324
00:36:06,658 --> 00:36:07,367
I don't know.

325
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,579
Oh. Now that's aggravating.

326
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:11,621
Sheriff?

327
00:36:11,621 --> 00:36:13,165
Still sweating.

328
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:16,960
Oh, Sheriff, we just missed him!

329
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:21,048
We gotta circulate this. On radio.

330
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:23,091
Alright.

331
00:36:24,176 --> 00:36:26,219
What do we circulate?

332
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:31,725
Lookin for a man who has
recently drunk milk?

333
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,564
Ah, Sheriff, that's aggravating.

334
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:39,733
I'm ahead of you there.

335
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:46,448
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of
the sorts of sons of bitches that are hunting him?

336
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:48,617
I don't know. He ought to...

337
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:53,789
He seen the same things I've seen,...

338
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:56,833
...and it certainly made an impression on me.

339
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,800
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

340
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,426
Someplace cheap.

341
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:10,514
You tell me the option.

342
00:37:10,514 --> 00:37:11,848
Do what now?

343
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:15,560
You pick the option goes with the applicable rate.

344
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:20,399
I'm just one person. So, don't
matter the size of the bed.

345
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:29,449
<i>This is Roberto Sagramore,
I'm not here right now.</i>

346
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,867
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

347
00:39:30,112 --> 00:39:31,363
Hello?

348
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:33,865
Is Llewelyn there?

349
00:39:34,157 --> 00:39:36,868
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

350
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:39,371
You expect him?

351
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,289
Now why would I expect him?

352
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:43,500
Who's this?

353
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:52,634
Can I help you?

354
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:55,846
Yeah. You got a pair of Larry Mahan's,
shoulder size 11.

355
00:39:55,846 --> 00:39:57,264
I'll check.

356
00:39:57,305 --> 00:39:59,224
- You sell socks?
- Just white.

357
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,059
White is all I wear.

358
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,853
You got a bathroom?

359
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:31,840
Don't stop. Just ride me
up past those rooms.

360
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:35,218
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

361
00:40:35,635 --> 00:40:37,429
I want to see if someone's here.

362
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:47,064
Keep going. Don't stop.

363
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:50,359
I don't wanna get into some
kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

364
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:51,735
It's alright.

365
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:55,530
Why don't I just set you down around here
and we won't argue about it.

366
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:58,116
Take me to another motel.

367
00:40:58,241 --> 00:40:59,659
Let's just call it square.

368
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:02,662
Look, you're already in a jackpot.
I'm trying to get you out of it.

369
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:04,331
Now take me to another motel.

370
00:41:54,506 --> 00:41:57,008
The lab reports from Austin on
that boy by the highway.

371
00:41:57,008 --> 00:41:58,218
What was the bullet?

372
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,636
There wasn't no bullet.

373
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:01,847
Wasn't no bullet?

374
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:03,724
Yes sir. Wasn't none.

375
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:08,979
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

376
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:10,564
No sir.

377
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:13,442
You said entry wound in the forehead.

378
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,735
No exit wound.

379
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:15,610
Yes sir.

380
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,487
Are you telling he shot this boy in the head...

381
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,573
...and then went digging around in
there with a pocket knife?

382
00:42:20,657 --> 00:42:22,659
Sir, I don't want to picture that.

383
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,077
I don't either!

384
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:25,912
Can I freshen that there for you, Sheriff?

385
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:28,457
Yeah, Noreen, you better had.

386
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:31,960
The Rangers and the DEA are headed back
out to the scene this morning.

387
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:34,171
You gonna join 'em?

388
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:36,673
Any new bodies accumulated out there?

389
00:42:38,341 --> 00:42:39,593
No sir.

390
00:42:39,676 --> 00:42:41,595
Well then, I guess I can skip it.

391
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:58,528
Twelve gauge. You need shells?

392
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:02,532
- Yeah. Double ought.
- They'll give you a wallop.

393
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:04,493
Y'all got camping supplies?

394
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:06,620
Tent poles?

395
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,288
You already have a tent?

396
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:09,498
Somethin' like that.

397
00:43:09,498 --> 00:43:12,292
Well, you give me the model number on the
tent, I can order you the poles.

398
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:13,835
Never mind. I want a tent.

399
00:43:13,835 --> 00:43:17,172
- Well, what kind of tent?
- The kind with the most poles.

400
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:40,779
Could I get another room?

401
00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:42,322
You want to change rooms?

402
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:44,825
No m'am, I want to keep my room
and get another one.

403
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,243
Another additional?

404
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:47,494
Yes, m'am.

405
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:49,705
And do you have a map of the rooms?

406
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:52,833
Yeah, we had a sorta one.

407
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:01,842
How bout 38?

408
00:44:01,925 --> 00:44:04,803
Well, you can have the one right
next to yours if you want.

409
00:44:04,803 --> 00:44:06,722
Number 137. It ain't took.

410
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:08,432
No, 38 will be fine.

411
00:44:08,765 --> 00:44:10,892
That's got two double beds.

412
00:50:38,447 --> 00:50:40,032
No me, mate.

413
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:47,914
How'd you find it?

414
00:50:48,457 --> 00:50:50,542
No me, mate.

415
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:39,484
Shouldn't be doin' that.
Even a young man like you.

416
00:52:41,153 --> 00:52:45,240
- Doin what?
- Hitchhiking.

417
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,864
Dangerous.

418
00:53:10,615 --> 00:53:13,994
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

419
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:16,621
Yes sir.

420
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:19,332
When did you last see him?

421
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:24,171
November 28th, last year.

422
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:28,758
You seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

423
00:53:28,758 --> 00:53:29,468
No sir.

424
00:53:29,468 --> 00:53:33,346
But you struck me as a man who wouldn't
want to waste a chair.

425
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:38,059
I remember dates. Names. Numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

426
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:42,606
We got a loose cannon here.

427
00:53:42,606 --> 00:53:43,940
And we're out a bunch of money,...

428
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,859
...and the other party is out his product.

429
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:46,860
Yes sir.

430
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:51,823
This account will give up twelve hundred dollars
in any twenty-four hour period.

431
00:53:51,823 --> 00:53:53,909
That's up from a thousand.

432
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:56,661
If your expenses run higher I hope
you'll trust us for it.

433
00:53:57,496 --> 00:53:59,039
Okay.

434
00:53:59,748 --> 00:54:02,250
Just how well do you know Chigurh?

435
00:54:02,584 --> 00:54:03,710
What do you want to know?

436
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,171
I just want to know your opinion of him.

437
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:07,047
In general.

438
00:54:07,506 --> 00:54:10,008
Just how dangerous is he?

439
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,969
Compared to what? The bubonic plague?

440
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:15,222
He's bad enough that you called me.

441
00:54:15,263 --> 00:54:18,934
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer but so what?

442
00:54:19,935 --> 00:54:21,394
There's plenty of them around.

443
00:54:21,645 --> 00:54:24,272
He killed three men in Del Rio Motel yesterday.

444
00:54:24,272 --> 00:54:28,068
And two others in that colossal
goatfuck out in the desert.

445
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:29,778
We can stop that.

446
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,530
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

447
00:54:33,281 --> 00:54:37,202
You've led something of a charmed
life haven't you, Mr. Wells?

448
00:54:37,744 --> 00:54:39,162
In all honesty,...

449
00:54:39,162 --> 00:54:42,874
...I can't say that charm has had a
whole lot to do with it.

450
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:46,169
I'm wondering...

451
00:54:46,211 --> 00:54:47,629
Yes?

452
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,882
Can I get my parking ticket validated?

453
00:54:52,926 --> 00:54:55,720
An attempt at humor, I suppose.

454
00:54:55,762 --> 00:54:57,264
I'm sorry.

455
00:55:01,726 --> 00:55:07,691
- You know I counted the floors of this building from the street?
- And?

456
00:55:08,066 --> 00:55:10,152
There's one missing.

457
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:14,573
We'll look into it.

458
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:36,928
One room, one night.

459
00:55:37,262 --> 00:55:40,474
- That'll be twenty-six dollars.
- Alright.

460
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:46,313
You on all night?

461
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:49,357
Yes sir, I'll be around here until
ten o'clock in the morning.

462
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:54,905
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

463
00:55:55,697 --> 00:55:57,991
There's someone who's been
lookin for me. Not police.

464
00:55:57,991 --> 00:56:01,495
Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.

465
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,331
By anyone, I mean any swinging dude.

466
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:48,125
There just ain't no way.

467
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:05,883
Were you in a car accident?

468
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:10,429
I'll give you five hundred bucks for that coat.

469
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:13,682
Let me see the money.

470
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:18,103
Were you in a car accident?

471
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:20,439
Yeah.

472
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:24,485
- Gimme the money.
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.

473
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:27,029
Let him hold the money.

474
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:44,338
Gimme that beer too.

475
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:48,008
How much?

476
01:06:49,176 --> 01:06:50,928
Brian. Give him the beer.

477
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:06,897
Medico. Por favor.

478
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:12,768
Any word on those vehicles yet?

479
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:15,813
Sheriff, I found out everything there was to find.

480
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,608
Those vehicles are titled and registered
to deceased people.

481
01:13:20,984 --> 01:13:23,403
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead twenty years.

482
01:13:23,654 --> 01:13:25,781
Did you want me to see what I could
find out about the Mexican ones?

483
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:27,783
No. Lord no.

484
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:30,410
Here's this month's checks.

485
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,705
That DEA agent called again.

486
01:13:33,747 --> 01:13:34,832
You don't want to talk to him?

487
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm goin' to try and keep from it
as much as I can.

488
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:40,337
He's goin' back out there and he wanted
to know if you wanted to go with him.

489
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,089
That's cordial of him.

490
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:45,175
Could I get you to call Loretta for me...

491
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:47,427
...and tell her I'm goin' to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

492
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:48,929
Yes, Sheriff.

493
01:13:48,971 --> 01:13:51,140
I'll call her when I get there.

494
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:53,934
I'd call her now but she'll want me to come
home and I just might.

495
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:56,895
- You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
- Uhuh.

496
01:13:57,521 --> 01:14:00,816
You don't want to lie without what
it's absolutely necessary.

497
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:06,905
What is it that Torbert says
about truth and justice?

498
01:14:07,698 --> 01:14:11,493
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

499
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:14,371
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin'
myself twice daily.

500
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:17,207
It might come to three times
before it's over...

501
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,127
Oh, what the hell?

502
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:29,970
Sheriff?

503
01:14:31,472 --> 01:14:32,389
Have you looked at your load lately?

504
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:35,767
That is a damned outrage.

505
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:38,979
Oh. One of those tiedowns worked lose.

506
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:40,647
How many bodies did you leave with?

507
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:42,941
I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff.

508
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:46,528
Couldn't you all of took a van out there?

509
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,072
Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive.

510
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,783
You going to write me up for
improperly secured load?

511
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:53,452
You get your ass out of here.

512
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:03,587
I'm guessin' this isn't the future you had
pictured for yourself...

513
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:06,507
...when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

514
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:10,511
Don't worry. I'm not the man
that's after you.

515
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:12,513
I know.

516
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:17,142
- I've seen him.
- You've seen him?

517
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:19,186
And you're not dead.

518
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:24,233
Is this guy supposed to be the
ultimate bad-ass?

519
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:27,778
- No, I don't think that's how I'd describe him.
- How would you describe him?

520
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:32,282
I guess I'd say... he doesn't have a
sense of humor.

521
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,409
His name is Chigurh.

522
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,079
- Sugar?
- Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

523
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,916
- You know how he found you?
- I know how he found me.

524
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:43,710
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it is.

525
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:45,921
He won't find me again.

526
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:48,257
- Not that way.
- Not any way.

527
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:51,802
- Took me about three hours.
- Yeah, well, I've been immobile.

528
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,264
No. You don't understand.

529
01:15:56,974 --> 01:16:00,561
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

530
01:16:00,727 --> 01:16:02,229
What did you do?

531
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:04,523
- Welder.
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

532
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:06,984
Any of it. If it can be welded, I can weld it.

533
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:08,902
- Cast iron?
- Yes.

534
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:11,238
- I don't mean braze.
- I didn't say braze.

535
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,448
- Pot metal?
- What did I say?

536
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:16,743
Were you in Nam?

537
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:19,788
Yeah. I was in Nam.

538
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:23,417
So was I.

539
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:26,044
So what does that make me, your buddy?

540
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:32,467
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

541
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:36,013
It's too late. I spent it.

542
01:16:37,848 --> 01:16:41,727
About a million and a half on whores and whiskey
and the rest of it I just sort of blew it here.

543
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:47,399
How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa?

544
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,407
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- To kill your wife.

545
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:04,625
Maybe he's the one who needs to be worried.

546
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:08,128
- About me.
- He isn't.

547
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:12,257
You're not cut out for this.

548
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:16,804
You're just a guy who happened to
find those vehicles.

549
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:26,522
I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle.
Carson Wells.

550
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:29,858
Call me when you've had enough.

551
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:32,569
I can even let you keep a
little of the money.

552
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:34,071
If I was into cutting deals,...

553
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:36,365
...why wouldn't I just deal
with this guy Chigurh?

554
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:40,619
You don't understand. You can't
make a deal with him.

555
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:43,497
Even if you gave him the money back,
he'd still kill you...

556
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:45,999
...just for inconvenience in him.

557
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:49,962
He's a peculiar man. Might even say
he has principles.

558
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:55,050
Principles that transcend money or
drugs or anything like that.

559
01:17:55,551 --> 01:18:00,097
He's not like you.
He's not even like me.

560
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:04,560
He don't talk as much as you, I
give him points for that.

561
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:08,564
Carla Jean. Thank you for comin'.

562
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:09,982
Don't know why I did.

563
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:13,569
I told you, I don't know where he is.

564
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,863
- You ain't heard from him?
- No I ain't.

565
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:17,781
- Nothin'?
- Not word one.

566
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:21,910
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

567
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:26,165
-  He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

568
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:30,169
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

569
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:34,464
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

570
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:37,634
He won't neither.
He never has.

571
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:40,512
He can take all comers.

572
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:46,602
You know Charlie Walser?
He's got that place out east of Sanderson?

573
01:18:49,813 --> 01:18:52,941
Well you know how they used to slaughter beefs,
hit 'em right there with a maul...

574
01:18:52,983 --> 01:18:54,735
..truss 'em up and slit their throats?

575
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:57,946
Here Charlie's got one all trussed up
and all set to drain him...

576
01:18:57,988 --> 01:19:00,324
...and the beef comes to.
It starts thrashing around.

577
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:05,537
Six hundred pounds of very pissed-off livestock
if you'll excuse me.

578
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:09,208
Charlie grabs his gun there to shoot the
damn thing in the head...

579
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:15,005
...but with all the swayin' and then the trashin' it's a glance-shot and
ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder.

580
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:16,256
You go see Charlie,...

581
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:18,759
he still can't pick up his right hand for his hat...

582
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:22,387
The point bein', even in the contest
between man and steer,...

583
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:24,932
...the issue is not certain.

584
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:37,361
When Llewelyn calls, just tell him
I'll make him safe.

585
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,827
Course they slaughter steers a lot
different these days.

586
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:47,579
Use a air gun.

587
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:52,835
Shoots out a little rock, about that far into the brain.
Sucks right back in. Animal never knows what hit him.

588
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:59,341
- Why you telling me that, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

589
01:20:03,428 --> 01:20:05,514
My mind wanders.

590
01:21:28,555 --> 01:21:29,848
Hello, Carson.

591
01:21:32,976 --> 01:21:34,186
Let's go to your room.

592
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:49,159
We don't have to do this.

593
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:53,539
I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.

594
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:56,792
Why would I let you do that?

595
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:59,086
I'll make it worth your while.

596
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:02,714
Take you to an ATM. Forteen grand in it.

597
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,758
And everybody just walks away.

598
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:08,428
An ATM...

599
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:17,479
- I know where the satchel is.
- If you knew, you would have it with you.

600
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:22,234
Find it from the river bank. I know where it is.

601
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:25,445
I know something better.

602
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,115
- What's that?
- I know where it's going to be.

603
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:36,081
- Where is that?
- It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.

604
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:42,921
You don't know to a certainty.
Twenty minutes it could be here.

605
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,301
I do know to a certainty. And you know
what's going to happen now, Carson?

606
01:22:48,385 --> 01:22:52,931
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

607
01:22:58,187 --> 01:22:59,563
You go to hell.

608
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:03,150
Alright.

609
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:04,943
Let me ask you something.

610
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:11,867
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,...

611
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:14,328
...of what use was the rule?

612
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:24,254
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

613
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:27,633
You mean the nature of this conversation?

614
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:29,802
I mean the nature of you.

615
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:40,479
You can have the money, Anton.

616
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:21,061
<i>Hello?</i>

617
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:22,396
Yes?

618
01:24:25,357 --> 01:24:27,151
<i>Is Carson Wells there?</i>

619
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:31,655
Not in the sense that you mean.

620
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,993
<i>You need to come see me.</i>

621
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:37,870
Who is this?

622
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,830
You know who it is.

623
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:43,041
You need to talk to me.

624
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,543
<i>I don't need to talk to you.</i>

625
01:24:44,543 --> 01:24:45,836
I think you do.

626
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,964
Do you know where I'm going?

627
01:24:49,339 --> 01:24:51,508
Why would I care where you're going.

628
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,552
I know where you are.

629
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:56,096
<i>Yeah? Where am I?</i>

630
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,182
You're in a hospital across the river.

631
01:24:58,223 --> 01:25:03,145
But that's not where I'm going.
Do you know where I'm going?

632
01:25:05,481 --> 01:25:07,149
<i>Yeah. I know where you're going.</i>

633
01:25:07,149 --> 01:25:08,734
Alright.

634
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,236
<i>You know she won't be there. </i>

635
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:13,447
It doesn't make any difference where she is.

636
01:25:13,489 --> 01:25:15,365
So what're you goin up there for?

637
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:22,039
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?

638
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:25,083
No.

639
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:30,005
I think you do too.
So this is what I'll offer.

640
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:33,258
You bring me the money and I'll let her go.

641
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:38,055
<i>Otherwise she's accountable.
Same as you.</i>

642
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,559
That's the best deal you're going to get.

643
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:46,814
I won't tell you you can save yourself
because you can't.

644
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:52,152
Yeah, I'm goin to bring you somethin' alright.

645
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:55,864
I've decided to make you a special
project of mine.

646
01:25:55,906 --> 01:25:57,866
You ain't goin' to have to come
look for me at all.

647
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:04,748
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes sir.

648
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:07,292
None of the three had ID on 'em,...

649
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:09,169
...but they're tellin me that all three is Mexicans.

650
01:26:09,837 --> 01:26:10,671
Was Mexicans.

651
01:26:10,838 --> 01:26:15,634
There's a question.  Whether they
stopped it? And when?

652
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:19,138
Yes sir.

653
01:26:19,805 --> 01:26:22,224
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about
the lock cylinder?

654
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:25,102
- Yes sir. It was punched out.
- Okay.

655
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:27,563
You wanna drive out there?

656
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:31,608
No, that's all I've to look for and it sounds like
these old boys died of natural causes.

657
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:33,110
How's that, Sheriff?

658
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:35,320
Natural to the line of work they was in.

659
01:26:35,362 --> 01:26:36,363
Yes sir.

660
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:40,159
My god, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I can't
think of any other word for it.

661
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,411
Who are these people?

662
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:45,247
Here last week they found this couple out...

663
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:47,833
...in California, they'd rent out
rooms to old people.

664
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:52,462
Kill em, bury em in the yard and cash their
social security checks.

665
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:56,967
They'd torture them first.
I don't know why.

666
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:00,262
Maybe their television set was broke.

667
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:03,098
And this went on until, and here I quote:

668
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:09,271
<i>Neighbors were alerted when a man ran
from the premises wearing only a dog collar.</i>

669
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:14,568
You can't make up such a thing as that.
I dare you to even try.

670
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:17,863
But that's what it took, you'll notice.
Get somebody's attention.

671
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:21,158
Diggin graves in the back yard
didn't bring any.

672
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:30,667
That's all right. I laugh
myself sometimes.

673
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:35,589
There ain't a whole lot else you can do.

674
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,343
Tell me something.

675
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:42,638
Who do you think gets through this gate
into the United States of America?

676
01:27:44,598 --> 01:27:47,142
I don't know. American citizens?

677
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:49,770
Some American citizens. Who do
you think decides?

678
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:53,232
- Well, you do, I reckon.
- That is correct. How do I decide?

679
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:56,026
- I don't know.
- I ask questions.

680
01:27:56,068 --> 01:28:00,155
And if I get sensible answers then they get to go to America.
If I don't get sensible answers they don't.

681
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:02,199
- Anything about that you don't understand?
- No sir.

682
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:05,035
Then I ask you again. How you come to be
out here with no clothes?

683
01:28:06,495 --> 01:28:08,372
I got an overcoat on.

684
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:11,041
- Are you jackin' with me?
- Oh, no sir.

685
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:12,876
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes sir.

686
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:16,046
- Are you in the service?
- No sir. I'm a veteran.

687
01:28:16,088 --> 01:28:18,465
- Nam?
- Yes sir. Two tours.

688
01:28:18,507 --> 01:28:19,675
What outfit?

689
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:25,305
Twelfth Infantry Battalion.
August 7th 1966 to July 2nd 1968.

690
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:29,143
- Wilson!
- Yes sir.

691
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:33,856
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

692
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:46,451
- How those Larries holdin' up?
- Oh, good.

693
01:28:46,493 --> 01:28:49,246
- I need everything else.
- Okay.

694
01:28:50,414 --> 01:28:53,000
You have a lot of people come in here
without any clothes on?

695
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,377
No sir, it's unusual.

696
01:29:08,932 --> 01:29:10,309
<i>She don't want to talk to you.</i>

697
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,685
Yes she does. Put her on.

698
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:13,103
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

699
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:15,772
I don't care what time it is. And
don't you hang up this phone.

700
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,821
- Llewelyn.
- Hey you.

701
01:29:23,071 --> 01:29:26,074
- What should I do ?
- You know what's goin' on?

702
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:29,828
I don't know, I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County.

703
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:31,205
What did you tell him?

704
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:35,709
<i>What did I know to tell him?
You're hurt, ain't you?</i>

705
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:39,213
What makes you say that?

706
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:41,131
<i>I can hear it in your voice.</i>

707
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:43,300
<i>There is falseness in his voice!</i>

708
01:29:43,634 --> 01:29:46,303
Look, I want you to meet me at the
Desert Sands motel in El Paso.

709
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:49,515
Cause I'm gonna give you the money
and I'ma put you on a plane.

710
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:52,142
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.

711
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:56,104
No. This works better. With you gone and
I don't have the money, he can't touch me.

712
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:58,065
But I can sure touch him.

713
01:29:58,106 --> 01:30:00,526
And after I find him I'll
come and join you.

714
01:30:00,818 --> 01:30:04,196
<i>Find who? What am I supposed
to do with Mother?</i>

715
01:30:04,196 --> 01:30:06,365
- Nah, she'll be alright.
- She'll be alright?

716
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,909
<i>Be all right?! I've got the cancer!</i>

717
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:11,453
Ain't nobody's gonna bother her.

718
01:30:45,529 --> 01:30:46,738
Who are you?

719
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:53,162
- Me?
- Yes.

720
01:30:53,203 --> 01:30:56,707
Nobody. Accounting.

721
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,420
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

722
01:31:03,589 --> 01:31:09,011
He feels...he felt that...
the more people looking...

723
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:13,390
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.

724
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:20,189
I see. Are you going
to shoot me?

725
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:32,534
That depends.
Do you see me?

726
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:37,998
I always seen this is what it would come to.

727
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:40,584
Three years ago I pre-visioned it.

728
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:42,586
It ain't even three years we been married.

729
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:47,007
Three years ago I said them
very words. No and Good.

730
01:31:47,174 --> 01:31:51,428
Here we are.
Ninety degree heat.

731
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:55,724
I got the cancer. And look at this.
Not even a home to go to.

732
01:31:56,517 --> 01:32:02,481
We're goin' to El Paso Texas. You know how
many people I know in El Paso Texas?

733
01:32:02,523 --> 01:32:05,859
- No ma'am.
- That's how many.

734
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:17,746
- I didn't see my Prednizone.
- I put it in, Mama.

735
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:21,250
- Well I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in. That one.

736
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:25,337
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

737
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:27,923
Do you need help with the bags, madam?

738
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:31,635
Well, thank god there is one gentleman
left in West Texas.

739
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:34,596
Yes, thank you. I am old
and I am not well.

740
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:39,143
- Which bus are you taking?
- We're going to El Paso. Don't ask me why.

741
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:42,104
It's not often you see a Mexican in a suit.

742
01:32:42,396 --> 01:32:45,607
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

743
01:32:46,316 --> 01:32:48,026
<i>Carla Jean, how are you?</i>

744
01:32:48,235 --> 01:32:52,114
Sheriff, was that a true story about
Charlie Walser?

745
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:53,907
<i>Who's Charlie Walser?</i>

746
01:32:57,369 --> 01:33:01,498
Oh! Oh, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail
but it's certainly true that it is a story.

747
01:33:02,332 --> 01:33:02,916
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

748
01:33:04,918 --> 01:33:06,962
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on somethin'?

749
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:09,089
<i>Yes ma'am?</i>

750
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:12,217
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,...

751
01:33:12,217 --> 01:33:14,928
...you promise it'll be just you goes
and talks with him?

752
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:16,930
You and nobody else.

753
01:33:17,264 --> 01:33:18,974
Yes ma'am, I do.

754
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:21,393
<i>Llewelyn would never ask for help.</i>

755
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:23,937
He never thinks he needs any.

756
01:33:24,188 --> 01:33:26,857
<i>Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.</i>

757
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:31,528
<i>And he needs help, whether
he knows it or not.</i>

758
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,247
What's the problem there, neighbor?

759
01:33:43,624 --> 01:33:46,835
That'll suck some power.
Over time.

760
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:52,508
- You from around here?
- Alpine. Born and bred.

761
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:53,634
Here ya go.

762
01:33:54,176 --> 01:33:59,389
- What airport would you use?
- Well? Airport or airstrip?

763
01:33:59,598 --> 01:34:02,768
- Airport.
- Well, where ya goin'?

764
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:07,105
- I don't know.
- Just lightin' out for the territories, huh?

765
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:09,733
Brother, I been there.

766
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:10,692
Well...

767
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:14,738
There's airstrips.
The airport is El Paso.

768
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:19,034
You want some place specific you might could
be better off just drivin' to Dallas.

769
01:34:19,952 --> 01:34:20,744
Not have to connect.

770
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:26,708
- You gonna clamp them, buddy?
- Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed?

771
01:34:27,793 --> 01:34:29,795
What're you talkin' about?

772
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:50,649
- Hey. Mr. Sporting Goods.
- Hey yourself.

773
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:52,526
You a sport?

774
01:34:53,777 --> 01:34:55,696
Yeah, that's me.

775
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:58,073
I got beers in my room.

776
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,119
Waiting on my wife.

777
01:35:02,953 --> 01:35:07,332
- That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
- Half.

778
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:11,670
- What else then?
- Just lookin' for what's comin'.

779
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,299
Yeah, but no one ever sees that.

780
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:19,011
Beer. That's what's comin'.

781
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:22,222
I'll bring the ice chest out here.
You can stay married.

782
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:24,725
No ma'am. I know what beer leads to.

783
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:29,021
Beer leads to more beer.

784
01:36:22,366 --> 01:36:24,409
Call police.

785
01:36:30,332 --> 01:36:31,875
Your local law enforcement.

786
01:36:34,336 --> 01:36:35,546
I'm not on their radio.

787
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:28,932
Buy you a cup of coffee
before you drive home?

788
01:37:29,516 --> 01:37:30,893
No money in his room there?

789
01:37:31,018 --> 01:37:35,522
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres
would've taken the stash.

790
01:37:36,064 --> 01:37:40,152
I suppose so. Though they was
leavin' in a hurry.

791
01:37:40,527 --> 01:37:43,280
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom.

792
01:37:43,614 --> 01:37:45,324
The money and the drugs.

793
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:49,578
It's just goddamned beyond everything.

794
01:37:50,037 --> 01:37:52,915
What's it mean?
What's it leading to?

795
01:37:53,457 --> 01:37:58,045
You know, if you'd a told me twenty years
ago, I'd see children walking...

796
01:37:58,045 --> 01:38:02,633
the streets of our Texas towns with green
hair and bones in their noses.

797
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:05,344
I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.

798
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:09,515
Signs and wonders. But I think once
you quit hearin' sir and ma'am,...

799
01:38:09,515 --> 01:38:11,433
...the rest is soon to follow.

800
01:38:11,975 --> 01:38:16,188
Oh, it's the tide.
It's the dismal tide.

801
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,857
- It is not the one thing.
- Not the one thing.

802
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:20,984
None of that explains your man though.

803
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:25,155
He's just a goddamn homicidal
lunatic, Ed Tom.

804
01:38:25,405 --> 01:38:28,534
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Yeah well, what would you call him?

805
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:32,538
I don't know. Sometimes I think
he's pretty much a ghost.

806
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:34,414
- He's real all right.
- Oh yeah?

807
01:38:34,581 --> 01:38:38,502
All that at the ???
Motel. It's beyond everything.

808
01:38:38,877 --> 01:38:41,130
Yeah, he has some hard bark on him.

809
01:38:41,755 --> 01:38:43,757
That don't hardly say it.

810
01:38:44,716 --> 01:38:46,635
He shoots the desk clerk one day.

811
01:38:46,635 --> 01:38:50,430
Walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired army colonel.

812
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,641
It's hard to believe.

813
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:55,727
Strolls right back into a crime scene.

814
01:38:56,103 --> 01:39:00,774
Who would do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

815
01:39:03,152 --> 01:39:04,486
Good trip, Ed Tom.

816
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:07,114
I'm sorry we couldn't help your boy.

817
01:42:39,243 --> 01:42:40,869
Min back!

818
01:42:41,203 --> 01:42:44,873
- How'd you know I was here?
- Who else'd be driving up your truck?

819
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:47,292
- You heard it?
- How's that?

820
01:42:47,668 --> 01:42:53,590
- You heard what I'm - you havin fun with me?
- What give you that idea?

821
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:57,427
- I seen one of the cats heard it.
- But - how'd you know it was my truck?

822
01:42:58,262 --> 01:43:01,140
I deduced it. When you walked in.

823
01:43:01,348 --> 01:43:02,975
How many of those things you got now?

824
01:43:03,016 --> 01:43:05,310
Cats? I don't know. Several.

825
01:43:06,019 --> 01:43:08,272
Well, it depends on what you mean by got.

826
01:43:09,106 --> 01:43:12,901
Some of 'em are half-wild, and
some of 'em are just outlaws.

827
01:43:16,446 --> 01:43:19,241
How you been, Ellis?

828
01:43:19,241 --> 01:43:24,872
You lookin' at it. I got to say
you lookin' older.

829
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,498
I am older.

830
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:30,043
Got a letter from your wife.

831
01:43:30,043 --> 01:43:34,715
She writes to me pretty regular,
keep me up on the family news.

832
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,218
- Didn't know there was any.
- She told me you were quittin'.

833
01:43:41,388 --> 01:43:44,099
- You want a cup?
- 'Preciate it.

834
01:43:51,773 --> 01:43:53,484
How fresh is that coffee?

835
01:43:53,817 --> 01:43:59,198
I generally make a fresh pot ever week
even if there's some left over.

836
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:04,661
That man who shot you died in prison.

837
01:44:06,038 --> 01:44:07,623
In Angola.
Yeah.

838
01:44:08,332 --> 01:44:10,584
What would you a done if
he'd been released?

839
01:44:11,418 --> 01:44:16,006
I don't know. Nothin.
Wouldn't be no point to it.

840
01:44:16,632 --> 01:44:19,259
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.

841
01:44:19,301 --> 01:44:22,846
Well, all the time you spend
tryin' to get back...

842
01:44:22,846 --> 01:44:26,433
...what's been took from you more
is goin' out the door.

843
01:44:26,809 --> 01:44:30,562
After a while, you just have to try
to get a tourniquet on it.

844
01:44:30,938 --> 01:44:34,775
Your granddaddy never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

845
01:44:37,694 --> 01:44:40,280
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.

846
01:44:40,697 --> 01:44:42,241
How come're you doin' that?

847
01:44:42,533 --> 01:44:44,076
I don't know.

848
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:49,164
I feel overmatched.

849
01:44:53,043 --> 01:44:55,420
I always figured when I got older,...

850
01:44:56,004 --> 01:45:00,551
...God would sort of come into
my life in some way.

851
01:45:03,637 --> 01:45:05,097
He didn't.

852
01:45:08,475 --> 01:45:10,477
I don't blame him.

853
01:45:12,563 --> 01:45:15,941
If I was him I'd have the same opinion
about me that he does.

854
01:45:16,233 --> 01:45:18,360
You don't know what he thinks.

855
01:45:32,291 --> 01:45:36,420
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and
badge over to the Rangers.

856
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,421
Put up in a museum.

857
01:45:38,839 --> 01:45:42,551
Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

858
01:45:43,385 --> 01:45:47,055
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

859
01:45:49,308 --> 01:45:53,854
Seven or eight of 'em come up to here.
Wantin' this and wantin' that.

860
01:45:54,438 --> 01:45:57,357
Uncle Mac went back in the house
and got the shotgun,...

861
01:45:57,357 --> 01:46:00,235
They was way ahead of him.

862
01:46:01,403 --> 01:46:03,572
Shot him in the doorway.

863
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:06,867
Aunt Ella came out and tried to stop the bleedin'.

864
01:46:06,909 --> 01:46:09,661
Uncle Mac all the while tryin'
to get that shotgun.

865
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:14,249
They just sat there on their
horses watchin' him die.

866
01:46:15,918 --> 01:46:20,756
After a while, one of 'em says somethin in
Injun and they all turned and left out.

867
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:28,847
Well, Uncle Mac knew the score
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

868
01:46:28,889 --> 01:46:31,266
Shot through the left lung.

869
01:46:32,142 --> 01:46:36,438
And that was that. As they say.

870
01:46:39,566 --> 01:46:45,280
- When did he die?
- 1909.

871
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:51,328
No, I mean was it right away or in
the night or when was it?

872
01:46:51,537 --> 01:46:55,249
I believe it's that night. She
buried him the next mornin'.

873
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:58,127
Diggin' in that hard old caliche.

874
01:47:01,713 --> 01:47:04,675
What you got ain't nothin new.

875
01:47:05,217 --> 01:47:08,178
This country is hard on people.

876
01:47:11,348 --> 01:47:14,059
You can't stop what's comin'.

877
01:47:15,435 --> 01:47:18,272
Ain't all waitin' on you.

878
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:23,068
That's vanity.

879
01:48:23,086 --> 01:48:27,758
- I knew this wasn't done with.
- No.

880
01:48:28,467 --> 01:48:32,721
I ain't got the money.

881
01:48:32,721 --> 01:48:37,017
What little I had is long gone and
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

882
01:48:38,519 --> 01:48:42,898
I buried my mother today.
I ain't paid for that neither.

883
01:48:43,941 --> 01:48:46,276
I wouldn't worry about it.

884
01:48:48,529 --> 01:48:50,864
I need to sit down.

885
01:49:05,504 --> 01:49:08,006
You got no cause to hurt me.

886
01:49:08,382 --> 01:49:11,802
No. But I gave my word.

887
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,807
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

888
01:49:19,434 --> 01:49:25,399
That don't make sense. You gave your
word to my husband to kill me?

889
01:49:25,691 --> 01:49:28,986
Your husband had the
opportunity to save you.

890
01:49:28,986 --> 01:49:32,281
Instead, he used you to try
to save himself.

891
01:49:37,286 --> 01:49:43,125
Not like that.
Not like you say.

892
01:49:48,589 --> 01:49:50,466
You don't have to do this.

893
01:49:50,799 --> 01:49:52,509
They'll always say the same thing.

894
01:49:54,344 --> 01:49:56,263
What did they say?

895
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:59,808
They say you don't have to do this.

896
01:50:00,225 --> 01:50:01,768
You don't.

897
01:50:10,235 --> 01:50:12,404
This is the best I can do.

898
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:15,157
Call it.

899
01:50:19,578 --> 01:50:23,081
I knowed you was crazy when
I saw you sittin' there.

900
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:28,086
I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

901
01:50:28,587 --> 01:50:31,089
- Call it.
- No.

902
01:50:32,549 --> 01:50:34,551
I ain't gonna call it.

903
01:50:37,971 --> 01:50:42,142
- Call it.
- The coin don't have no say.

904
01:50:42,684 --> 01:50:44,937
It's just you.

905
01:50:47,314 --> 01:50:50,818
Well, I got here the same
way the coin did.

906
01:52:33,128 --> 01:52:36,298
Mister, there's a bone stickin' out of your arm.

907
01:52:36,632 --> 01:52:38,509
I'm alright. Let me just sit
here a minute.

908
01:52:38,801 --> 01:52:41,720
There's an ambulance comin'.
Man over yonder went to call.

909
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:43,388
Alright.

910
01:52:44,056 --> 01:52:47,851
Are you all right? You got a
bone stickin' out of your arm.

911
01:52:48,852 --> 01:52:51,188
What will you take for that shirt?

912
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:58,987
Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt.

913
01:53:06,036 --> 01:53:08,831
Look at that fuckin' bone.

914
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:10,958
Tie this for me.

915
01:53:11,208 --> 01:53:13,085
Just tie it.

916
01:53:31,478 --> 01:53:36,024
Hell mister. Look, I don't mind helping
someone out. That's a lot of money.

917
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:41,155
Take it. Take it and you
didn't see me.

918
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:42,823
I was already gone.

919
01:53:43,157 --> 01:53:44,700
Yes sir.

920
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:52,416
- Part of that's mine.
- You still got your damn shirt.

921
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:55,919
- That ain't what it was for.
- Well maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.

922
01:54:17,232 --> 01:54:19,818
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- Okay.

923
01:54:20,068 --> 01:54:23,113
- What do you think?
- I can't plan your day.

924
01:54:25,032 --> 01:54:26,575
I mean, would you care to join me?

925
01:54:26,909 --> 01:54:28,786
Lord no. I'm not retired.

926
01:54:30,537 --> 01:54:32,956
Maybe I'll help out here then.

927
01:54:33,832 --> 01:54:35,542
Better not.

928
01:54:39,296 --> 01:54:42,800
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

929
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:46,428
Well you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

930
01:54:47,137 --> 01:54:49,848
They always is to the
party concerned.

931
01:54:52,351 --> 01:54:55,187
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

932
01:54:58,398 --> 01:55:01,068
Okay. Two of 'em. Both
had my father. It's peculiar.

933
01:55:02,486 --> 01:55:06,490
I'm older now than he ever
was by twenty years.

934
01:55:05,864 --> 01:55:09,743
So, in a sense he's the younger man.

935
01:55:10,327 --> 01:55:12,538
Anyway, first one I don't remember
too well but...

936
01:55:12,538 --> 01:55:17,042
It was about meeting him in town someplace
where he gave me some money.

937
01:55:18,043 --> 01:55:19,878
I think I lost it.

938
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:26,093
The second one, it was like we
was both back in older times...

939
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:30,597
...and I was on horseback goin'
through the mountains of a night.

940
01:55:30,806 --> 01:55:34,101
Goin' through this pass in the mountains.

941
01:55:34,351 --> 01:55:43,026
It was cold and there's snow on the ground. He rode past me and
kept on goin'. Never said nothin goin' by. He just rode on past.

942
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:48,740
He had his blanket wrapped around
him and his head down.

943
01:55:50,242 --> 01:55:52,244
When he rode past I seen he was...

944
01:55:52,244 --> 01:55:54,246
...carryin fire in a horn...

945
01:55:54,288 --> 01:55:58,625
...the way people used to do and I could see
the horn from the light inside of it.

946
01:55:58,876 --> 01:56:00,627
About the color of the moon.

947
01:56:02,171 --> 01:56:07,426
And in the dream I knew that
he was goin' on ahead...

948
01:56:07,426 --> 01:56:12,639
and that he's fixin to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and all that cold.

949
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:20,856
I knew that whenever I got
there he'd be there.

950
01:56:23,817 --> 01:56:24,902
Then, I woke up.
