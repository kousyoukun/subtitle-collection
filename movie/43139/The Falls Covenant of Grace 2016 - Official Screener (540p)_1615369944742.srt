1
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:54,301
我仍然不知道 世界之大 何处为家
I still don't know where we fit in the world.

2
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:02,808
我以为放弃信仰就能减轻
I thought leaving faith behind would relieve

3
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,944
我一直以来的负罪感
the dissonance I always felt.

4
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:10,349
并没有
It didn't.

5
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:18,957
一路走来 才发现我一直试图抓住某些价值
Through it all, I find myself holding onto these values.

6
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:24,729
我曾经的属灵同伴 Chris也一样 
So does Chris, my former mission companion.

7
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,466
出于某些原因 在探索这条道路上
For one reason or another, we've had trouble

8
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,035
我们遇到了麻烦
finding our way.

9
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:35,942
我已经一年没有见过他了
It's been a year since I've seen him,

10
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:39,412
明天他就要回来北镇了
and tomorrow, he comes back to the Northwest.

11
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,884
我们已经说好忘记以前的事重新开始
We've agreed to put it all behind us and start fresh,

12
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:51,056
不受教会家庭和距离或者其它什么事
uninhibited by the Church, our families, distance,

13
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:51,924
的影响
or anything else.

14
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:55,460
这是我们应得的
We deserve that.

15
00:01:57,298 --> 00:01:59,397
所有人都是
Everyone does.

16
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:04,903
* 你是否想坠落 *
* Don't you wanna fall *

17
00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:06,005
* 你是否想翱翔 *
* Don't you wanna fly *

18
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:12,142
* 你是否想垂吊悬崖边 *
* Don't you wanna be dangled over the edge *

19
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:15,447
* 体验危险浪漫 *
* Of this aching romance *

20
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:32,765
- 嗨  - 嗨

21

真不敢相信 你明天就回来了
I cannot believe you're going to be here tomorrow.

22

我说过原谅你了 我是认真的

我想别人肯定很疑惑
I just think people were legitimately confused

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,854
为什么两个男人会在我父母的结婚纪念日上接吻

我吃得下
I could eat.

100
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:08,164
我在这会让你们难堪吗
Am I that hard to be around?

101
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:13,603
不会
No.

102

我对这事倒不担心
I've got my heart set on sticking close to home.

106

只是有段时间没写了
I haven't written anything original in a while.

109

我忘了跟你说
I forgot to tell you my sister read

110
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:48,271

It's just that she knew you were talking about me,

115
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:58,381
就好像
and it was like...

116
00:08:58,383 --> 00:08:59,949
我知道 这就是为什么我要道歉
I know that's why I'm apologizing.

117

Chelsea最近怎么样
How is Chelsea?

118
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,522

She's good, it's Greg that I don't talk to,

119
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:08,291
但你已经知道了

他们知道你现在在这里吗
Do they know that you're here with me right now?

I'm not trying to get you drunk, it's just happening.

132
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,461
我们为什么需要这么久才能变得舒适
Why does it take us so long to get comfortable?

133
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:52,795
我不知道
I don't know.

134
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:59,569
感觉在你面前 我还是会紧张 
I feel like I still get...nervous around you.

135

耶 我也会紧张

144
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,946
而且你喝酒
and you're drinking beer.

145
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:21,084
盐湖城怎么样
And what about the Salt Lake City thing?

146
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:22,418
什么方面的
What about it?

147
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:25,622
你可以吗
Could you do it?

148
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:28,424
我觉得你完全可以
I think you could barely do it.

149
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:32,428
额 也行你最好不要
Well, maybe you won't have to.

150
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,837
好
Okay.

151
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,472
你要去哪
Where are you going?

152
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:44,941
我进去拿点啤酒
I am headed back to your house to get some more beer.

153
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:46,009
你不是说过不喝的嘛
I thought you said you weren't drinking.

154
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:49,545
你 帅哥 把门打开
You, sir, have opened the flood gates.

155
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,547
我已经没有退路了
I'm past the point of no return.

156
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:53,650
你不能就这样放弃
You can't just say that and then walk away.

157
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:55,151
太迟了
Too late.

158
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,419
拜托 
Come on, ugh.

159
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:08,765
你能行的
You'll be okay.

160
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,937
- 我认为它  - 有点干
- I think it's... - It's a little dry.

161
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,141
我们会没事的
We'll be okay.

162
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,176
我很好
I'm good.

163
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,921
- 嘿 你 额   - 自从上次分开
- Hey did you... - sleep with anybody else

164
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:33,690
你和其它人上过床吗
since I saw you last?

165
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,660
离开盐湖城后我和Paul做过一次
I had sex with Paul after Salt Lake.

166
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:39,162
这个我知道
I knew about that.

167
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,731
我说的是之后
I saw you after that.

168
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,734
有 我只是不知道还能再见到你
Yeah, I just didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

169
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,736
别担心
Don't worry about it.

170
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:52,709
你有男朋友吗
Was there anybody else?

171
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:58,281
嗯 或者一夜情什么的 
Um, like a night here, and a night there, but nothing real.

172
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:07,523
耶 我有破坏婚姻的坏习惯
Yeah, I had to break a couple bad habits myself.

173
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,325
还有什么比这更坏
What makes them bad?

174
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:13,830
只是 换个地方
Just, oing places, and...

175
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:20,937
认识新朋友
meeting people.

176
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:33,149
你觉得怎么样
What do you think about that?

177
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,221
我觉得我们不应该一直这样
I think that we shouldn't feel like we're bad people

178
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:39,622
妄自菲薄
all the time.

179
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,694
做爱很正常 你懂的 我们是需要发泄的
It's okay to have sex, you know, we're supposed to cum.

180
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:47,063
我们本应该如此的
We're supposed to cum.

181
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:50,967
我们是动物 这很正常
We are animals, it's okay.

182
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:54,303
我们很正常
We're okay.

183
00:14:55,874 --> 00:15:00,076
不要 不要随意断定我
You're not, you're not going to judge me?

184
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,477
我没有
No.

185
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,748
我只是希望我们能够打开天窗说亮话
I just wanted to get it all out in the open.

186
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,618
耶 这样很好
Yeah, it's fine.

187
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,590
我们把所有的事情摊开讲清楚
We can get everything out in the open.

188
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:20,163
还有多少件事没有摊开讲
Every last thing we can get out in the open.

189
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:29,038
三件 两件 一件
Three, two... one.

190
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,508

喝咖啡吗
Do you want some coffee?

193
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:54,390
我是摩门教的 先生
I am a Mormon, sir.

194
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,660
你现在是一个摩门教徒
So now you're a Mormon?

195
00:16:57,662 --> 00:16:58,662
阿门
Amen.

196

200
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:21,918
我喘口气
My breath.

201
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:24,387
我不在乎 快点
I don't mind, come on.

202
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:26,022
我知道
I do.

203
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:29,191
快点 快
Come on, go.

204
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:40,403
我还没有准备好
I wasn't ready for that.

205
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,638
那你为什么叫我去做
Then why did you tell me to do it?

206
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:45,775
开个玩笑
I'm just kidding.

207
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,984
我去买点早餐
I'll go make us some breakfast.

208
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:21,010
嘿 你想要鸡蛋吗
Hey, how do you want your eggs cooked?

209
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:32,655
怎么这么亮
Everything's so bright.

210
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,725
因为现在是白天
It's called day.

211

谢谢你的早餐
Thank you for breakfast.

212

不用谢
You're welcome.

213
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:48,571
你头在哪受伤的 那里吗
Where does your head hurt, there?

214
00:18:48,573 --> 00:18:50,239

219
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:56,572
"新来的教会指导表示同性家庭的孩子
"New IDS guidelines say children of same-sex couples...

220
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,575
不能接受洗礼仪式"
will not be baptized in the Church."

221
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,585
我知道你想争论这个
I know you want to discuss this,

222
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:10,986
但是能不能给我点时间
but if you'll just give me a moment

223
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:13,068
- 读完这篇报道  - 他们开玩笑的 对吗
- to read the whole article. - They're joking, right?

224
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:21,931
上面说由于同志家庭的小孩不能被同等对待
It says they're doing this for their own protection,

225
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,700
所以这样做是为了
that children from gay marriages can't be treated

226
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:26,335
保护他们
like everyone else.

227
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,975
免受更多来自同志父母的罪恶
Punishing children for the sins of their own fathers.

228
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:35,578
真不敢相信
We don't even believe in that.

229
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,283
其实我本可以骗你的
You can interpret this any way you want,

230
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,518
只是我已经说完了
but I am done.

231
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:46,322
我觉得你不会这么做
I don't think you mean that.

232

The love of your life is finally here,

242
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:17,887
你却给他这个

243
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,922
额 我只有这个
Well, it's all I had.

244
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:29,064
Sheris去哪了
Where's Sheris?

245
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,799
不清楚
Not sure.

246
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:32,568
一切都还好吧
Is everything okay?

247
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,938
不怎么好 不过我没事
No, but I'll be fine.

248
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,679
来吧
Come on.

249
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:45,147
什么
What?

250

我又不舌吻 来吧
I'm a lip kisser, come on.

251
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:48,150
哦
Oh?

252
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:54,290
什么 你如果和女人结过婚 那就无所谓了
What, you were married to a woman once, you'll be fine.

253
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:01,897
他的嘴唇好软
He has soft lips.

254

在一起

259
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:18,914
我猜人们是上下便便的

但是你得赶上来

287
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:13,602
这主要是口头上的，但他给了我很多。
It's mostly word of mouth, but he's giving me lots

288
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,204
的练习
of practice.

289
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,475
我们都知道他有多紧张。
We all know how tense he gets, right.

290
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:22,478
哇，可能是一个网站或名片。
Wow, maybe like a website or business cards.

291
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,781
是的，你知道，我也要处理这方面的事情。
Yeah, you know, I gotta handle that side as well.

292
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:28,784
我感觉到了
I'm feeling it out, literally.

293
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:32,788
好卡。-它也很精确
- Good card. - It's so accurate, too.

294
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,690
轮到你。——哦,当然,好的。
- Your turn. - Oh, sure, okay.

295
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:36,959
一生的礼物，一份悲伤的工作:故事。
Lifetime presents, A Sad Handjob: The Story

296
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:39,828
一个同性恋排球的蒙太奇。
of a Homoerotic Volleyball Montage.

297
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:42,031
我的手表。
I'd watch that.

298
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:48,671
我真不敢相信我和你一起抽大麻，克里斯。
I can't believe I'm smoking pot with you, Chris.

299
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:50,706
你爸爸是法定人数的一员。
Your dad's a member of the Quorum.

300
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,308
是的,他是Yes he is.

301
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,743
-是啊，这很难。
现在就给我们一个。
- Yeah, that's a tough
one for us right now.

302
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:59,014
是的,我听到……
-但这是意料之中的事。
- Yeah, I heard...
- but to be expected.

303
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:03,952
那你上哪儿去了?
你的使命,瑞安?
- So where did you serve
your mission, Ryan?

304
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:07,056
-我完成了我的使命。
在墨西哥城
- I spent my mission
in Mexico City

305
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,396
这是美丽的…
我的同伴也是如此。
it was beautiful...
and so was my companion.

306
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:21,003
连续一年……
For a year straight...

307
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:25,708
他总是改变
在我的面前……
he would always change
in front of me...

308
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,012
完全无辜的,
但他知道自己在做什么。
totally innocent,
but he knew what he was doing.

309
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,850
然后一个晚上,
我们在公共汽车上
And then one night,
we were on a bus

310
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:39,288
回到我们的地区，然后。
我趴在他的肩膀上睡着了
heading back to our district, and
I fell asleep on his shoulder.

311
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,658
回到我们的地区，然后。
我趴在他的肩膀上睡着了
While I was sleeping,
he had taken my hand,

312
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,961
他拿着它。
在一个男权控制。
and he was holding it
in a patriarchal grip.

313
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:50,399
我醒来……像这样…I woke up... like this...

314
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:53,569
我抬头一看
到他的眼睛,……
and I looked up
into his eyes, and...

315
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:58,607
我看到了欲望和爱。
和渴望……

316
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:06,448
但我也看到了
这深深的悲伤…

317
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:11,754
因为我们都知道

318
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:15,791
我们永远不能在一起……

319
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:20,896
就在这一刻。
在公共汽车的后面。

320
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:26,668
我们很快就被送回家了。

321
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,572
从那以后我就没见过他。

322
00:25:39,717 --> 00:25:44,486
但是看到你们
在一起这么长时间后…

323
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:45,954
它给了我希望。

324
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,626
我要走了。

325
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:52,895
——真的吗?

326
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:57,065
-是的…
-很高兴见到你。

327
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:58,434
——是的,你也一样。

328
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:00,736
-你还好吗?

329
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:02,471
——不是。

330
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:04,873
——嘿,嘿,嘿…

331
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:13,048
爱你。

332
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:15,384
——爱你。

333
00:26:25,863 --> 00:26:27,629
你们在哪里认识的?

334
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:29,498
-嗯，我们是在肯定的时候认识的。

335
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,492
就像一个互助小组。
康复的摩门教徒。

336
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:32,592
-是的，我知道那是什么。

337
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:37,206
-是的，他父母踢了。
他离开了房子。

338
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:38,640
——哇。

339
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:42,211
——我不知道,
我为他感到难过。

340
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:46,014
他在这里没有
没有家人或朋友。

341
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:49,284
——哇。

342
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:53,155
——你明白吗?

343
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,557
-是的。

344
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,229
——你要来吗?

345
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:01,296
-是的。

346
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:10,138
——哦,对不起。
——没关系。

347
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,488
-你和Ryan有没有…

348
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,093
——没有。

349
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:42,237
-他肯定爱你。

350
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:51,647
-你爱我吗?

351
00:30:38,082 --> 00:30:39,247
你想喝点水吗?

352
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:40,716
那些是什么?

353
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:43,919
-哦，我有压力。
点在我的后背。

354
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,721
-你的背怎么了?

355
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:50,025
-只是那些年而已。
拎着一个沉重的手提箱。

356
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:54,863
——谢谢。

357
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:56,164
-是的。

358
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:06,975
-哇，有点冷。

359
00:31:20,557 --> 00:31:23,058
我能问你个问题吗?

360
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,092
——确定。

361
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:28,663
你会考虑去吗?
和我的圣礼?

362
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:35,470
-克里斯，我就是不喜欢。
知道要点是什么。

363
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:37,205
-我觉得不是。
巧合,你住

364
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,541
只有几个街区
远离战争。

365
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:42,244
现在回来还不晚。

366
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:44,112
-你以为我去哪儿了?

367
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:47,249
-不远，除非所有这些。
客厅里的东西。

368
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:48,617
只是一场表演。

369
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,819
-我还在想办法。
他们努力

370
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,288
我想说的是。
371
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:01,518
顺便说一下…
你知道吗?

371
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:01,397
——什么?

372
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,699
-关于政策，做了。
你知道在他们制造之前。

373
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,034
这一消息?

374
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:08,737
——没有……你真的认为
这一点我知道。

375
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:13,575
-我不知道，我只是…我不
知道吗，我想如果你做了，

376
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:16,578
也许有一些
你本可以做的。

377
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,680
——我不知道。
——就像什么?

378
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:21,316
-跟你父亲谈谈。

379
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:24,186
——可能
好,会做什么?

380
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,560
-我不知道，他。
像一个内心的声音。

381
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:34,596
十二门徒之中有一个
使徒们有一个同性恋的儿子。

382
00:32:34,598 --> 00:32:35,931
如果那不是预言，

383
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:39,935
那我就不知道是什么了。

384
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,474
你想过吗?

385
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:50,245
会是什么样子呢?

386
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:51,213
——什么?

387
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:53,715
-我想起来了。
所有的时间…

388
00:32:53,717 --> 00:32:57,552
和你在一起,结婚……

389
00:33:00,924 --> 00:33:05,861
在教堂
上面的封口机,

390
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:08,330
我的父母和你的父母。

391
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:16,471
我做……但它不是
将会发生什么。

392
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:18,974
不是这样的。

393
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:23,311
你知道教会做什么吗?

394
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:25,981
他们更让我信服。
也许是约瑟夫·史密斯。

395
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:27,816
真的把一切都搞砸了。

396
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:29,417
——不要这样做。

397
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,486
你怎么能成为其中的一份子呢?
疏远了的东西

398
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:34,556
父母从孩子吗?

399
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,092
你不理解
这对你意味着什么?

400
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:39,160
-我一直坚持。
教会的一切。

401
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:41,763
缺陷和特质,
就像我一直和你在一起一样。

402
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:43,632
这些年来。

403
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:45,600
-你在说什么?

404
00:33:45,602 --> 00:33:47,702
我完成了,
我已经填满。

405
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:50,205
-不，你放弃了，
这是不同的。

406
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:52,007
-你没有。
离开的勇气。

407
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:53,742
-我不想离开。

408
00:33:53,744 --> 00:33:57,112
-你好吗?
对待你的方式，

409
00:33:57,114 --> 00:34:00,448
或者他们对待你的方式。
家人和你的女儿吗?

410
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,284
作为一个父亲,如何
你接受吗?

411
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:04,719
-我所做的一切都是为了她。

412
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:07,989
你可以质疑我的信仰。
作为一个有信仰的人，

413
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:11,426
但你从来没有质疑过。
我对我女儿的忠诚。

414
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:12,827
——我很抱歉。

415
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,333
我很抱歉。

416
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:23,738
-我在这里做什么?

417
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:27,375
我在做什么?

418
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:33,615
我只是觉得有义务
你,你知道的。

419
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:36,818
我只是不断
回来,回来

420
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,254
因为这是我所知道的一切。

421
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,489
——哇。

422
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,239
——瑞奇?

423
00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:04,713
-嘿…你还好吗?

424
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:06,114
嘿。

425
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:07,816
怎么了?

426
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:09,718
你还好吗?

427
00:35:10,654 --> 00:35:12,620
哇,哇,哇。
简单,简单,

428
00:35:12,622 --> 00:35:14,089
好吧。

429
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:19,928
怎么了?嘿,看着我……
我就在这里。

430
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:25,700
呼吸……你还好吗?

431
00:35:25,702 --> 00:35:27,836
-我有时会得到这些。

432
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:32,841
——嘿,嘿…好了,

433
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,810
好吧。

434
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:14,115
回到现实生活中。

435
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,452
-这就是现实生活。

436
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:25,060
对不起,我们继续
他妈的。

437
00:36:25,062 --> 00:36:27,462
-你不必道歉。

438
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:40,909
——好的。

439
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,144
——谢谢。

440
00:39:52,702 --> 00:39:54,469
——叫克里斯。

441
00:39:56,973 --> 00:39:59,807
——比如列表
一个你…

442
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,976
调用移动
克里斯的数量。

443
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:16,591

589
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:57,331
—老美林。

590
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:58,832
- Good to see you.

591
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:07,608
-我不知道该拿什么，所以我。
吃了各种各样的食物，泰国菜。
- I didn't know what to get, so I
got a variety of foods, pad Thai.

592
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:09,677
-我希望饭
对每个人都好。
- I hope Thai is
good for everyone.

593
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,414
我们没剩多少了。
招待会后,所以…
We didn't have much left
after the reception, so...

594
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:16,583
看起来不错，又好又热。
Looks good, nice and hot.

595
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:18,752
史密斯兄弟,
你喜欢为我们祈祷吗?
Brother Smith, would
you like to pray for us?

596
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:22,089
—我的美林
如果是会员，就应该受到尊敬。
- Elder Merrill, I'd
be honored if a member

597
00:51:22,091 --> 00:51:24,258
法定人数的
说祝福。
of the Quorum would
say a blessing.

598
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,062
-好吧，叫我诺亚好吗?
- Okay, call me Noah, alright?

599
00:51:28,064 --> 00:51:30,130
—让我们祈祷
- Let's pray.

600
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:36,570
我们的天父,
谢谢你带来的一切
Our Heavenly Father,
thank you for bringing

601
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:40,407
汤姆和RJ安全地到我们这里。
今天和我们的家庭。
Tom and RJ safely to us
today and as our families

602
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:42,843
聚在一起,请帮助
我们引导我们的谈话,
come together, please help
us guide our conversation,

603
00:51:42,845 --> 00:51:46,747
帮助我们了解
对每个人来说都是最好的,
help us discover what
is best for everyone,

604
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:48,882
以
耶稣基督名义,阿门。
in the name of
Jesus Christ, Amen.

605
00:51:48,884 --> 00:51:50,417

607
00:52:08,771 --> 00:52:13,107
今天在这里，就是这样。
你能来真是太好了。
for being here today, it was
very gracious of you to come.

608
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:21,382
我必须说清楚。
现在和贝尔的证词
I have to make clear right
now and bear testimony

609
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:24,251
对你们每个人……
to each of you that...

610
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:28,355
性的关系
sexual relations

611
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:32,226

同性是错误的
between two of the
same sex is wrong.

612
00:52:32,228 --> 00:52:36,196
通过这样做，我们的孩子。
成为变节者,
By doing so, our children
become apostates,

613
00:52:36,198 --> 00:52:39,867
并且应该扑杀
的王国
and should be culled
from the kingdom.

614
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:43,270
现在世界上的其他国家可能会。
走一条不同的路，
Now the rest of the world may
be taking a different path,

615
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:46,974
但是我们保持忠诚
福音。
but we remain faithful
to the Gospel.

616
00:52:46,976 --> 00:52:49,843
-你做得很漂亮。
大胆的假设,爸爸。
- You've made some pretty
bold assumptions, Dad.

617
00:52:49,845 --> 00:52:52,479
-我见过。
我自己的眼睛,克里斯。
- I've seen it with
my own eyes, Chris.

618
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:53,914
我读过他的书。
I've read his book.

619
00:52:55,184 --> 00:52:56,683
—有一本书吗?
- There's a book?

620
00:52:56,685 --> 00:53:00,120
-这是一个详细的描述。
他们的使命。
- It's a detailed account
of their mission together.

621
00:53:00,122 --> 00:53:02,890
而你，你感觉如何。
关于这个
And you, how do you feel
about this, having your

622
00:53:02,892 --> 00:53:05,759
每个人看法不一样?
adventures out there in
print for everyone to see?

623
00:53:05,761 --> 00:53:07,494
-我不想让他们指出来。
- I wouldn't want them in print.

624
00:53:07,496 --> 00:53:10,431
-好吧，没人会读。
一本关于你的书，格雷格。
- Well, no one would read
a book about you, Greg.

625
00:53:11,534 --> 00:53:13,267
-你读了整件事吗?
- Did you read the whole thing?

626
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:16,336
-我尽可能多地读。
- I read as much as I could.

627
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:18,372
-那部分呢?
他们帮助经验丰富的
- What about the part when
they helped the veteran

628
00:53:18,374 --> 00:53:23,243
创伤后应激障碍使他平静下来。
天上的父亲和他自己。
with PTSD make his peace with
heavenly Father and himself.

629
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:24,912
你读了吗?
Did you read that?

630
00:53:26,715 --> 00:53:29,416
-你的儿子和我相爱了。
- Your son and I fell in love.

631
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:35,222
我们做了人们做的事情。
当他们相爱的时候。
We did things that people do
when they love each other.

632
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:39,893
-信仰不是金赛的尺度。
- Faith isn't a Kinsey scale.

633
00:53:39,895 --> 00:53:41,795
你不是一个有信仰的人，
或者你不是。
You're either a man of faith,
or you're not.

634
00:53:41,797 --> 00:53:46,066
美林，我可以向你保证，RJ…
   爸爸。
- Elder Merrill, I can assure you, RJ...
- Dad.

635
00:53:46,068 --> 00:53:48,535
不管你喜欢与否,
我在你的生活。
Like it or not,
I'm in your life.

636
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:55,075
不管上帝与否，我都能感觉到。
今晚失去了这个女人，
A man of God or not, I feel the
loss of this woman tonight,

637
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:57,144
我通过他感觉到了。
and I feel it through him.

638
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:02,916
他是我爱的人。
我爱他的家人。
And he's a man that I love
and whose family I love.

639
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:11,892
-我妈妈会爱你的。
- My mother would've loved you.

640
00:54:13,863 --> 00:54:15,162
就像我做的事。
Just like I do.

641
00:54:27,776 --> 00:54:31,145
—所以这是什么
要看起来像什么?
- So what's this
going to look like?

642
00:54:31,147 --> 00:54:33,447
—是什么
要看起来像什么?

going to look like?

643
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:34,815

646
00:54:39,288 --> 00:54:41,488
—好吧,RJ搬到波特兰,爸爸。
- Well, RJ moved
to Portland, Dad.

647
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,557
-这是一样的。
- Well, that's the same thing.

648
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,025
凯莉在盐湖城。
Kaylee's in Salt Lake City.

649
00:54:48,797 --> 00:54:51,632
- RJ和我不是。
现在在一起。
- RJ and I aren't
together right now.

650
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:55,502
-等一下，我想。
你们是…
- Wait a minute, I thought
that you guys were...

651
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:57,739
ya know.

652
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:02,442
—是的,为什么不呢?我刚听到
你说你爱他。
- Yeah why not? I just heard
you say that you love him.

653
00:55:15,891 --> 00:55:19,326
你介意我问一下吗?
问题是什么?
Do you mind if I ask
what the problem is?

654
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:28,902
-教会…在哪里
我们完全融入其中。
- The Church... and where
we fit inside of it all.

655
00:55:28,904 --> 00:55:30,237
我们不知道。
We don't know.

656
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,410
我明白了
- I see.

657
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:48,655
Thanks.

658
00:55:48,657 --> 00:55:51,592
RJ,谢谢你
克里斯在这里。

659
00:55:51,594 --> 00:55:53,360

You know, RJ, I get it...

我和你妈
想要对你最好的，并且…
Your mother and I
want the best for you, and...

664
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:58,659

你比他强。
I can't think of anyone
better for you than him.

00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:09,536
我想让你知道……
我为你骄傲，儿子。
I want you to know...
I'm proud of you, son.

666
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:13,173

我知道有人在
你的情况。
I knew someone in
your situation once.

670
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,169
他不是那样
像你和克里斯一样勇敢。
He wasn't nearly as
courageous as you and Chris.

671
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:46,173
-是的，我想我记得。
你谈论他。
- Yeah, I think I remember
you talking about him.

你知道
发生在他身上?

happened to him?

I'll listen.

00:58:19,508 --> 00:58:20,807
- Thank you, son.

678
00:58:41,397 --> 00:58:43,997
*看太阳*。
* Looking at the sun *

679
00:58:43,999 --> 00:58:48,235
*你认为只有这样。
天空中的一盏灯*。
* You think there's only
one light in the sky *

680
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:53,273
*你不会是对的*
* You wouldn't be right *

681
00:58:53,275 --> 00:58:56,977
*等到夜晚来临*
* Wait until the night comes *

682
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:05,318
看到一万亿的太阳。
旋转上面*
* See a trillion suns
spinning up above *

683
00:59:07,389 --> 00:59:10,223
这就是它的本质。
* That's how it is *

684
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:14,194
就是这样。
* That's how it is when *

685
00:59:26,508 --> 00:59:28,108
请坐
- Have a seat.

686
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:31,545

00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:38,952
是的,我们很好

690
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:41,455
现在告诉我关于盐湖的事。

691
00:59:42,558 --> 00:59:46,193
-是真的。
难过,很甜。
- Well, it was really
sad and really sweet.

692
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:51,932
我们说再见,
和…现在我在这里。
And we said goodbye,
and... now I'm here.

693
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:56,736
—不
任何意义。
- Well that doesn't
make any sense.

694
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:02,042
你们一直在做这个。
六,七年。
You guys have been at this
what, six, seven years.

695
01:00:02,044 --> 01:00:07,581
我爱你，不，
我是摩门教徒，不，我不是。
I love you, no I don't,
I'm Mormon, no I'm not.

696
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:11,084
我父母会生气的如果我们操，我们不该操
My parents will be mad if
we fuck, we shouldn't fuck.

697
01:00:11,086 --> 01:00:13,720
他妈反对我们的宗教。
Fucking is against our religion.

698
01:00:13,722 --> 01:00:15,755
如果每个人都只会
别再胡闹了。
If everyone would just
stop giving a fuck about

699
01:00:15,757 --> 01:00:18,124
其他人是谁
他妈的就不会
who everyone else was
fucking then there wouldn't

700
01:00:18,126 --> 01:00:19,926
是一个问题。
be a problem.

701
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:22,662
我不在乎谁。
除了莎丽。
I don't care who anyone
fucks except for Sharis.

702
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:25,165
我为什么要在乎?
那个家伙诅咒
Why should I care about
who that guy fucks,

703
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:29,336
或者那个混蛋，或者那个。
盖伊·福克斯，或者那个混蛋，

or that guy fucks, or that
guy fucks, or that guy fucks,

704
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:31,505
都是废话。
it's all bullshit.

705
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:33,673
- Yeah, I agree.

706
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:39,679
-好，那又怎样。
你害怕什么?
- Good, so then what
are you afraid of?

707
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,617
没什么
- Nothing.

708
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:57,364
-你知道有。
社区的人。
- You know there's a
community of people out there

709
01:00:57,366 --> 01:01:02,636
谁爱你,
希望你快乐。
who love you and
want you to be happy

710
01:01:02,638 --> 01:01:07,040
我们希望你找到真爱。
and we want you to find love.

711
01:01:09,077 --> 01:01:11,344
-你知道，我能做到。
- You know, I could do it.

712
01:01:13,415 --> 01:01:20,086
我可以妥协，如果。
这意味着和他一起生活。
I could-I could compromise if
it meant living a life with him.

713
01:01:21,523 --> 01:01:23,223
-那你为什么不呢?
- So then why don't you?

714
01:01:24,393 --> 01:01:28,895
-因为你不是同性恋，
或者你是个有信仰的人……
- Because you're either gay,
or you're a man of faith...

715
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,698
但显然
你不能两者兼而有之。
but apparently
you can't be both.

716
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:36,970
- Hey.
- Hi.

717
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:45,145
-你知道，你知道的停止说话。
- You know, you can tell
her to stop talking.

718
01:01:45,147 --> 01:01:46,580
这就是我做的
That's what I do.

719
01:01:51,186 --> 01:01:52,852
醒着的我。
Waking me up.

720
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:55,255
Hi.

721
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:05,532
我听说了克里斯的妈妈。
I heard about Chris's mom.

722
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:11,004
你过得如何?
How are you doing?

723
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,274
- Eh...

724
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:16,876
—来到这里。
- Come here.

725
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:32,225
-你让我感觉像。
当你这样做的时候。
- You make me feel like
a baby when you do that.

726
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:34,094
-因为你是一个。
- Because you are one.

727
01:03:17,572 --> 01:03:20,373
—不,不,不。
-跟我多做一个。
- No, no, no.
- Do one more with me.

728
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:23,176
—不,我很好。
-再来一个，来吧。
- No, I'm good.
- Just one more, come on.

729
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:26,780
-不，真的，我很好。
——好。
- No, really, I'm good.
- Fine.

730
01:03:29,518 --> 01:03:31,418
-你要崩溃了。
- You are falling apart.

731
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:36,756
我是- - - ?我想我
终于放松了。
- Am I? I think I'm
finally letting loose.

732
01:03:36,758 --> 01:03:38,858
—好吧,你已经
放松一段时间。
- Well, you've been
letting loose for a while.

733
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,561
你需要放松一下。
- Well, you need to loosen up.

734
01:03:55,811 --> 01:03:57,377
我们现在该怎么办?
What do we do now?

735
01:03:59,147 --> 01:04:02,515
-我晕过去了，因为我有。
早上去做编辑。
- Well I pass out because I have
to go be an editor in the morning.

736
01:04:02,517 --> 01:04:06,419
-不，不，不，我是说。
你的身体工作。
- No, no, no, I mean
your body of work.

737
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:10,323
书架上的那些书，它们是。
充满了你的感情
Those books on the shelf, they're
filled with your feelings

738
01:04:10,325 --> 01:04:11,858
关于这个的人
about this man.

739
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:13,960
他是你的缪斯女神。
He was your muse.

740
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:18,932
-我会找到新的。
- I'll find a new one.

741
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,169
-我可以做你的缪斯女神。
- I could be your muse.

742
01:04:24,306 --> 01:04:26,005
I make a great muse.

743
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:29,075
- Yeah, you are.

744
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:38,518
- What?

745
01:04:39,187 --> 01:04:40,587
没什么
- Nothing.

746
01:05:33,975 --> 01:05:39,179
- Okay, okay,
no, okay, okay, okay.

747
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:42,415
—他不在这里。
- He's not here.

748
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:44,250
-这不关他的事。
- It's not about him.

749
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:46,886
你被我吸引对吧?
- You're attracted to me right?

750
01:05:46,888 --> 01:05:49,322
- Of course, you're beautiful.

751
01:06:01,169 --> 01:06:06,105
Hey come on, please don't be...

752
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:09,142
别让这
是我们之间的尴尬。
Don't let this
be awkward between us.

753
01:06:09,144 --> 01:06:11,077
—太迟了。
- Too late.

754
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:13,713
-听着，我对你有感觉。
- Look, I have feelings for you.

755
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:17,684
他们是
复杂的感情。
And they are
complicated feelings.

756
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,586
我们就是不能做爱。
We just can't have sex.

757
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:22,622
它会搞砸了。
It'll mess it up.

758
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:25,792
-我们都知道那是什么。
爱的东西
- We both know what it's
like to love something

759
01:06:25,794 --> 01:06:29,696
这并不爱
我们回来了,不是吗?
that doesn't love
us back, don't we?

760
01:06:32,634 --> 01:06:36,936
-瑞安…来吧。
- Ryan... come on.

761
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,538
—什么?
- What?

762
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,874
-过来，过来。
- Come here, come on.

763
01:06:43,111 --> 01:06:45,144
Come here.

764
01:07:01,096 --> 01:07:04,130
—你还
相信上帝,RJ吗?
- Do you still
believe in God, RJ?

765
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,903
你认为
他现在在这里吗?
Do you think that
He's here right now?

766
01:07:20,382 --> 01:07:23,783
因为我开始
看到我们的天父…
Because I'm starting to
see our Heavenly Father...

767
01:07:23,785 --> 01:07:30,523
就像我看到了先知。
或者其他领导人，就像…
like I see the Prophet
or the other leaders, as...

768
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:32,859
有缺陷的人。
flawed men.

769
01:07:34,529 --> 01:07:37,597
我不想
看到这样的他。
I don't want to
see Him like that.

770
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:43,169
我想知道他是谁。
在这里，他爱我。
I want to know that He's
here, and that He loves me.

771
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:49,275
-你现在感觉到被爱了吗?
- Do you feel loved right now?

772
01:07:53,415 --> 01:07:55,348
-在这一刻，我愿意。
- In this moment, I do.

773
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:01,154
-也许他是
- Then maybe He is.

774
01:08:11,066 --> 01:08:13,333
-我不得不承认…
- I have to admit...

775
01:08:13,335 --> 01:08:17,337
我不想要你和克里斯。
工作了。
I didn't want you and Chris
to work out.

776
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:18,471
—我知道。
- I know that.

777
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:22,875
-我只是不想。
失去我们拥有的。
- I just didn't want
to lose what we have.

778
01:08:25,246 --> 01:08:28,348
-我不是你想要的，
我想你们都知道。
- I am not what you want,
and I think you know that.

779
01:08:30,785 --> 01:08:34,587
-我看着你们，
我心想，
- I looked at you guys,
and I thought to myself,

780
01:08:36,157 --> 01:08:41,494
“我想要……我想要的。
"I want that... I want that.

781
01:08:42,564 --> 01:08:44,964
或类似的东西。
Or something like that."

782
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:46,899
-你可以拥有它
- You can have it.

783
01:08:50,038 --> 01:08:52,305
-我想找个家，RJ。
- I want a family some day, RJ.

784
01:08:52,307 --> 01:08:54,507
我想要一个礼堂婚礼
I want a Temple wedding.

785
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:57,010
我不希望别人告诉我。
我要被驱逐了。
I don't want to be told that
I'm going to be banished

786
01:08:57,012 --> 01:08:59,579
这些希望在外面看来太黑暗。
to the outer darkness
for wanting that.

787
01:09:01,116 --> 01:09:03,983
我去过黑暗的地方，
I have been to the dark places,

788
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:06,719
我去过黑暗的地方，
and I had to pull myself out.

789
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:11,824
我不想回去。
I don't want to go back there.

790
01:09:28,977 --> 01:09:35,248
-你可以拥有所有这些，
但如果你走了，就不是了。
- You can have all of that,
but not if you're gone.

791
01:09:57,305 --> 01:09:59,038
-我们现在做什么?
- What do we do now?

792
01:10:07,415 --> 01:10:10,216
我们打电话给你
任务的同伴。
- We call your
mission companion.

793
01:10:10,218 --> 01:10:12,852
-不，不，我们没有。
-是的。是的。
- No, no we don't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

794
01:10:14,289 --> 01:10:18,624
-来吧，有办法吗?
找个老彼得森?
- Come on is there a way to
get a hold of Elder Petersen?

795
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:22,128
- Maybe.

796
01:10:23,698 --> 01:10:25,398
- Then let's call him.

797
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,235
-可能不是。
他的电话号码。
- It's probably not even
his number any more.

798
01:10:29,237 --> 01:10:31,737
除了他不会
接,他可能
Besides he wouldn't
pick up, he's probably

799
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:34,340
和他的朋友们
什么的。
out with his friends
or something.

800
01:10:34,342 --> 01:10:37,076
在BYU，就像凌晨2点。
At BYU, it's like 2 am.

801
01:10:38,213 --> 01:10:42,482
-好吧，也许不是，但是。
但他还是不接电话
- Okay, well maybe not, but
still he wouldn't pick up.

802
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:45,952
- Well then it doesn't matter.

803
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:48,020
他可能会生我的气。
- He might be angry with me.

804
01:10:48,022 --> 01:10:49,088
- Why?

805
01:10:52,427 --> 01:10:55,128
他回家做我们做的事
- He went home for what we did.

806
01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:01,467

他感到羞愧。
He's ashamed.

807
01:11:05,707 --> 01:11:09,108
-他可能会掉进去。
爱着另一个男孩,
- He could fall in
love with another boy,

808
01:11:10,345 --> 01:11:14,714
更糟的是，他可以结婚。
一些毫无戒心的女孩
or worse, he could marry
some unsuspecting girl.

809
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:17,016
—我一直在喝酒。
- I've been drinking.

810
01:11:17,018 --> 01:11:19,318
—这只会帮助。
- That'll only help.

811
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,288
-我改天再打给他。
- I'll call him some other time.

812
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:24,624
-不，不，今晚，我们。
今晚会打电话给他。
- No, no, tonight, we're
gonna call him tonight.

813
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:27,627
克里斯从来不回答你的问题。
你的使命后调用。
- Chris never answered your
calls after your mission.

814
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:29,795
-是的，我不够努力。
-好吧，他不让你这么做。
- Yeah, I didn't try hard enough.
- Well, he didn't let you.

815
01:11:29,797 --> 01:11:32,798
-我本可以更努力的。
-别像我那样搞砸了。
- I could've tried harder.
- Don't fuck this up like I did.

816
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,133
—你没有。
- You didn't.

817
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:38,571
来吧，让我看看你的手机。
- Come on let me see your phone.

818
01:11:38,573 --> 01:11:40,373
—这可能是死了
- It's probably dead.

819
01:11:45,346 --> 01:11:47,113
—你不会
来吧，来吧。
- You're not going
to do it, come on.

820
01:11:47,115 --> 01:11:49,182
-让我来整理一下。
- Just let me sort it out.

821
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:53,085
—他的室友
可能现在
- His roommates are
probably out right now

822
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,687
与他们的女朋友沉溺。
soaking with their girlfriends.

823
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:56,155
恶心
- Gross.

824
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:03,462
-他一个人在宿舍，
他要你给他打电话。
- He's alone in his dorm,
and he wants you to call him.

825
01:12:03,464 --> 01:12:04,830
不,他没有。
- No, he doesn't.

826
01:12:07,936 --> 01:12:11,837
你知道你什么时候想。
你爱的人,
- You know when you think
about someone you love,

827
01:12:11,839 --> 01:12:15,708
通常因为他们
我也想着你。
it's usually because they're
thinking about you, too.

828
01:12:36,297 --> 01:12:38,264
- Hello?

829
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:42,201
- It's Ryan.

830
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:47,106
我在波特兰。
I'm in Portland.

831
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:50,343
That's cool.

832
01:12:50,345 --> 01:12:52,578
你怎么知道我会起床?
How did you know I'd be up?

833
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,313
-只是运气好，我想。
- Just luck, I guess.

834
01:12:55,383 --> 01:12:59,885
很高兴收到你的来信。
It's nice to hear from you.

835
01:13:01,389 --> 01:13:03,522
-太好了。
听到你的声音。
- It's so good to
hear your voice.

836
01:13:03,524 --> 01:13:05,057
很奇怪你会叫,
It's weird you'd called,

837
01:13:05,059 --> 01:13:06,993
我一直在想你。
I've been thinking about you.

838
01:13:06,995 --> 01:13:08,327
—你有吗?
- You have?

839
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:12,698
—是的,
像所有的翻转时间一样。
- Yeah,
like all the flipping time.

840
01:13:18,306 --> 01:13:19,939
你独自一人吗?
- Are you alone?

841
01:13:21,409 --> 01:13:24,143
Yeah, are you?

842
01:13:25,213 --> 01:13:26,912
- Yeah, I am.

843
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,916
你最近怎么样?
So, how have you been?

844
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,488
- Good.

845
01:13:39,394 --> 01:13:42,328
I miss you.

846
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:44,630
- I miss you, too.

847
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,134
- Really?
- Yeah.

848
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:53,906
我真希望能看到你的脸。
- I wish I could see your face.

849
01:13:57,512 --> 01:14:00,046
-也许我们可以。
实现它。
- Well maybe we could
make that happen.

850
01:14:00,048 --> 01:14:03,049
- Really?
- Yeah.

851
01:14:08,122 --> 01:14:11,991
我记得你是如何
过去常常看着我。
- I remember how you
used to look at me.

852
01:14:11,993 --> 01:14:15,328
-就像你是唯一的。
世界上的人吗?
- Like you were the only
person in the world?

853
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:17,229
- Yeah.

854
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:19,632
-因为我只看到了这些。
- It's because that's all I saw.

855
01:14:23,071 --> 01:14:25,471
I love you.

856
01:14:29,877 --> 01:14:31,711
- I love you, too.

857
01:14:33,648 --> 01:14:36,382
So much.

858
01:14:40,188 --> 01:14:44,857
我回家,
我认为这是时间
- I'm coming home,
I think it's time.

859
01:16:19,287 --> 01:16:20,986
-主席，我可以坐下吗?
- President, may I sit?

860
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:23,468
—是的,哥哥美林。
- Yes, brother Merrill.

861
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:33,532
我先说一下。
我为你祈祷。
Let me first say that
I am praying for you.

862
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:36,135
我一直在说话
我们的天父,
I've been speaking with
our Heavenly Father,

863
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:37,837
和他爱你。
and He loves you.

864
01:16:37,839 --> 01:16:41,740
黛比是亲爱的
我和弗朗西斯
Debbie was dear to
me and to Francis.

865
01:16:41,742 --> 01:16:44,443
切尔西和格雷格，
克里斯和凯莉吗?
How are Chelsea, and Greg,
Chris and Kaylee?

866
01:16:46,013 --> 01:16:50,082
-切尔西正在接受。
这很困难，格雷格也是。
- Well Chelsea is taking
it pretty hard, as is Greg.

867
01:16:51,185 --> 01:16:54,753
凯莉,我们告诉她
那个Deedee已经走了
Kaylee, we tell her
that Deedee has gone on

868
01:16:54,755 --> 01:16:58,724
给她永恒的家庭，但是。
你知道，她是个孩子。
to her eternal family, but
you know, she's a child.

869
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:02,695
克里斯是一个顽固的人
Chris has been a rock.

870
01:17:02,697 --> 01:17:05,297
他实际上是一个
很大一部分原因
And he's actually a
big part of the reason

871
01:17:05,299 --> 01:17:07,399
我今天在这里。
I'm here today.

872
01:17:07,401 --> 01:17:09,168
- Oh?

873
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:13,506
-他受同性恋的影响很多年
- He suffered from same-sex
attraction for many years.

874
01:17:13,508 --> 01:17:18,010
我尽力了，我什么都做了。
我可以帮助他
I tried, I did everything
I could to help him,

875
01:17:18,012 --> 01:17:20,813
但我现在已经停止了。
but I've stopped that now.

876
01:17:20,815 --> 01:17:23,949
-这是非常困难的。
的情况
- It's a very difficult
situation.

877
01:17:23,951 --> 01:17:28,220
-我意识到他。
他的样子很好。
- I realized that he
is fine the way he is.

878
01:17:28,222 --> 01:17:31,257
没有必要
为他改变。
There's no need
for him to change.

879
01:17:32,026 --> 01:17:33,459
- Brother Merrill,

880
01:17:33,461 --> 01:17:37,329
你知道路西法会的。
试着每一个技巧来误导我们。
you know that Lucifer will
try every trick to mislead us.

881
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:41,800
,你继续
教我保持开放。
- You continue to
teach me to be open

882
01:17:41,802 --> 01:17:45,571
来促进。
精神，我感觉到我的心。
to the promptings of the
spirit, and I feel my heart

883
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:48,641
软化对克里斯
和许多忠实的
softening towards Chris
and the many faithful

884
01:17:48,643 --> 01:17:50,009
像他这样的人。
who are like him.

885
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:58,350
我们的灵性在哪儿?
Where's our spirituality?

886
01:17:58,352 --> 01:18:01,687
我们的反应
给上帝的爱?
Where's our response
to the love of God?

887
01:18:03,858 --> 01:18:07,893
这并不觉得
爱,让人们选择……
This doesn't feel like
love, making people choose...

888
01:18:09,196 --> 01:18:12,798
将自己
从他们的永恒。
separating ourselves
from them for eternity.

889
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:20,639
你看见什么了吗
世界上发生?
Have you seen what's
happening in the world?

890
01:18:20,641 --> 01:18:26,111
人被杀,
殴打,歧视
People are being killed,
beaten, discriminated against

891
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:30,950
每一天，我的儿子都在其中。
every day, my son among them.

892
01:18:30,952 --> 01:18:32,151
- I understand,

893
01:18:32,153 --> 01:18:36,622
brother Merrill,但我
从上帝那里得到消息……
brother Merrill, but I
have heard from the Lord...

894
01:18:36,624 --> 01:18:40,726
我们必须继续吗?
我们已经有了。
is that we have to proceed
as we already have.

895
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:44,830
-我也谈过了。
我们的天父。
- Well, I, too, have talked
to our Heavenly Father.

896
01:18:44,832 --> 01:18:46,380
哦,你有吗?
Oh, have you?

897
01:18:46,392 --> 01:18:51,070
是的，他告诉我了。
我们,使徒,和…
Yes and He told me that
we, the apostles, and...

898
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,308
Quorum必须继续
讨论这件事。
the Quorum must continue
to discuss this matter.

899
01:19:04,218 --> 01:19:07,620
——好了,儿子,你一会还有
你的会议。
- Alright, son, you'll
have your meeting.

900
01:19:08,889 --> 01:19:13,158
与此同时,
诺亚,得到一些休息
In the meantime,
Noah, get some rest.

901
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,727
你正在经历
更多的现在
You're going through
much more now

902
01:19:14,729 --> 01:19:16,495
比你意识到的。
than you may realize.

903
01:19:17,999 --> 01:19:21,667
-谢谢，但我真的。
现在就需要工作。
- Thank you, but I really
need to work right now.

904
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:24,837
- I understand.

905
01:19:24,839 --> 01:19:26,505
Let us pray.

906
01:19:26,507 --> 01:19:27,840
- Of course.

907
01:19:30,978 --> 01:19:36,115
亲爱的天父,
我们感谢你们的友谊。
- Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank you for the friendships

908
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:44,256
在困难时期支持我们……
当我们失去家庭
that support us in difficult times...
when we lose family

909
01:19:44,258 --> 01:19:48,127
直到我们看到他们
在永生,
until we see them
again in eternal life,

910
01:19:48,129 --> 01:19:49,695
它是非常困难的。
it is very hard.

911
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,367
—好的。你还记得这
这些在订单吗?
- Okay. Do you remember which
order these go in?

912
01:19:55,369 --> 01:19:56,402
- Yeah.

913
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:59,972
—好了,把他们
为了我。
- Alright, put 'em
in order for me.

914
01:20:07,982 --> 01:20:11,083
很好,不错。
Very good, good job.

915
01:20:12,987 --> 01:20:16,121
你能告诉我在哪儿吗?
奶奶，你还记得吗?
So can you tell me where
Grandma is, do you remember?

916
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:19,658
很好，这就是精神世界。
这是天堂。
Very good, that's the spirit world.
That's paradise.

917
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,460
这就是她的
等待我们所有人。
That's where she's
waiting for all of us.

918
01:20:21,462 --> 01:20:23,796
—在这里吗?
——是的,在这里
- Here?
- Yep, right there.

919
01:20:23,798 --> 01:20:26,899
——是的,在这里,
总有一天，我们都会
- Yeah, right there,
and one day, we will all

920
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:29,735
在一起在这里。
be together right here.

921
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:33,238
那就是你，我，还有。
妈妈会在那里
So it'll be you, and me, and
Mommy's going to be there,

922
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:37,443
还有你的奶奶，还有我们。
将永远在一起。
and your Grandma, and we
will all be together forever.

923
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:39,378
- RJ, too?

924
01:20:42,683 --> 01:20:45,651
是的,当然,
他会在那里
- Yeah, of course,
he'll be there.

925
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:51,490
当然，他会在那儿的，宝贝。
Of course, he'll be there, baby.

926
01:20:55,062 --> 01:20:56,795
哦，你妈妈要去。
几分钟后到这里。
Oh, your Mommy's going to
be here in a few minutes.

927
01:20:56,797 --> 01:20:58,597
你想去吗?
在外面等她?
Do you want to go
outside and wait for her?

928
01:20:58,599 --> 01:21:00,099
看看我们能不能看到她开车?
See if we can see her drive up?

929
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:01,633
- Yeah.
- Okay.

930
01:21:44,178 --> 01:21:46,779
-你保证你没疯。
我不会去拜你?
- You promise you're not mad
that I'm not going to BYU?

931
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:48,213
我不是疯了
- I'm not mad.

932
01:21:49,183 --> 01:21:50,849
这更有意义
This makes so more sense.

933
01:21:50,851 --> 01:21:53,552
你不需要
扰乱Kaylee的生活。
You won't have to
disrupt Kaylee's life.

934
01:21:54,789 --> 01:21:56,755
这个地方很漂亮。
This place is beautiful.

935
01:21:56,757 --> 01:21:58,190
-是的。
- Yeah.

936
01:21:58,192 --> 01:22:00,058
这是正确的事情。
It's the right thing.

937
01:22:04,932 --> 01:22:08,333
我在想我们的事。
与史密斯夫妇共进晚餐,
I was thinking about our
dinner with the Smiths,

938
01:22:08,335 --> 01:22:11,036
我多么希望你这样。
妈妈本来可以去的。
and how much I wished your
mom could have been there

939
01:22:11,038 --> 01:22:13,138
为了那
for that.

940
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:22,014
它有一个生命标记。
对它的感觉。
It had a life marker
feel about it.

941
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:31,023
它启发了我
带来一些问题
It's inspired me to
bring some matters up

942
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:33,025
在法定人数。
before the Quorum.

943
01:22:33,027 --> 01:22:36,361
我要拉一下。
新政策的主题。
I'm going to broach the
subject of the new policy

944
01:22:36,363 --> 01:22:39,832
和同性
在教堂里结婚。
and also same-sex
marriage in the Church.

945
01:22:44,638 --> 01:22:46,972
你怎么看?
What do you think about that?

946
01:22:50,945 --> 01:22:55,747
-我想我没说过。
你,但是……当我在
- I don't think I ever told
you this, but... while I was

947
01:22:55,749 --> 01:23:01,353
在治疗……他们告诉
我一次又一次,
in therapy... they told
me time and again,

948
01:23:01,355 --> 01:23:04,857
你可以选择上帝或。
你可以选择爱。
you can choose God or
you can choose love.

949
01:23:06,193 --> 01:23:09,661
嗯,对我来说,他们是
一个相同的。
Well, to me, they're
one in the same.

950
01:23:09,663 --> 01:23:13,298
我的女儿知道
这是一个孩子知道的。
My own daughter knows
that, a child knows that.

951
01:23:16,503 --> 01:23:19,438
我不会让。
谁能告诉我我能做什么。
I'm not going to let
anyone tell me who I can

952
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:24,076
不能与…我
不会让任何人……
and can't be with... and I'm
not going to let anyone...

953
01:23:24,078 --> 01:23:27,312
定义这些选择
对我来说。
define those choices
for me either.

954
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:37,823
这次会议的
总统的群体……
This meeting with the
President, with the Quorum...

955
01:23:40,427 --> 01:23:44,529
谢谢，但我希望你能。
不是为我做的。
thank you, but I hope you're
not doing it just for me.

956
01:23:46,967 --> 01:23:48,267
我希望你正在做的事情
因为你知道
I hope you're doing
it because you know

957
01:23:48,269 --> 01:23:50,869
这是正确的做法。
it's the right thing to do.

958
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,142
作为一名成员。
法定人数,我是有限的
- As a member of the
Quorum, I'm limited.

959
01:23:57,144 --> 01:24:01,013
我只是其中一个声音，但我要去
I'm one voice in that
room, but I'm going to have

960
01:24:01,015 --> 01:24:02,948
你妈妈和我在一起。
your mom with me.

961
01:24:08,522 --> 01:24:13,358
你知道的…当我看到
RJ和你在一起,
You know... when I saw
you and RJ together,

962
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,195
当他惊恐发作时，
你追着他跑…
when he had his panic attack,
and you ran after him...

963
01:24:17,197 --> 01:24:20,265
安慰他,说
他通过它。
reassured him, talked
him through it.

964
01:24:21,635 --> 01:24:25,637
这提醒我
你妈妈和我，
That reminded me so
much of your mom and I,

965
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:27,973
以及我们是如何互相关心的。
and how we cared for each other.

966
01:24:28,609 --> 01:24:30,275
这是爱。
That's love.

967
01:24:31,111 --> 01:24:33,145
我看到了
I saw that with you.

968
01:24:34,682 --> 01:24:39,351
这就像一个梦想……
It's like a dream...

969
01:24:39,353 --> 01:24:42,888
这种生活,
它只会持续很长时间
this life,
it only lasts so long.

970
01:24:49,697 --> 01:24:51,263
我爱你,儿子。
I love you, son.

971
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:54,399
- I love you, too, Dad.

972
01:24:58,072 --> 01:24:59,705
-天啊，我真想她。
- God, I miss her.

973
01:25:01,241 --> 01:25:02,641
- Me too.

974
01:25:04,345 --> 01:25:08,613
* His love shall light my way *

975
01:25:08,615 --> 01:25:13,151
* Through darkness
and through doubt *

976
01:25:13,153 --> 01:25:17,089
* Imprisoned by uncertainty *

977
01:25:17,925 --> 01:25:21,727
* His love has brought me out *

978
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,987
- Hey.
- Hi.

979
01:26:55,989 --> 01:26:57,522
你在这里多久了?
- How long have you been here?

980
01:26:57,524 --> 01:26:59,558
-三个半小时。
- Three and a half hours.

981
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,359
- I'm so sorry.

982
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:02,427
- It's okay.

983
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:05,430
-你进了法学院。

987
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:14,426
你不需要
为我坚强
You don't have to
be strong for me.

988
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,627
-我没必要说再见。
- I never got to say goodbye.

989
01:29:51,398 --> 01:29:53,698
她是如此好。

你不需要它,
但是你拥有它。

-嘿，嘿，你有时间。
- Hey, hey, you have time.

996
01:33:11,031 --> 01:33:12,697
你不会
想念你的航班。

miss your flight.

997
01:33:12,699 --> 01:33:14,999
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

998
01:33:20,507 --> 01:33:24,409
会是什么样子呢!
当你开始上学了吗?
What's in going to be like
when you start school?

999
01:33:24,411 --> 01:33:26,978
-你知道的。
现在每个人都要休息。
- Well, you know there's
going to be breaks every now

1000
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:32,817
然后,它
只有三年。
and then, and it's
only three years.

1001
01:33:32,819 --> 01:33:36,321
-很多事情都有可能发生。
在三年。
- A lot can happen
in three years.

1002
01:33:36,323 --> 01:33:38,356
- Yeah.

1003
01:33:38,358 --> 01:33:39,624
-我只是觉得。
你要离开,
- I just feel like
you're going to leave,

1004
01:33:39,626 --> 01:33:42,093
和所有的
还是一样的。
and everything's
going to be the same.

1005
01:33:42,095 --> 01:33:43,761
- RJ，我知道为什么。
你有这样的感觉
- RJ, I know why
you feel that way.

1006
01:33:43,763 --> 01:33:45,964
我今早祈祷了。
- I prayed this morning.

1007
01:33:48,702 --> 01:33:53,204
我祈求天上的
父亲给了我力量
I prayed for Heavenly
Father to give me strength.

1008
01:33:53,206 --> 01:33:57,041
我祈求力量
让我们去,
I prayed for strength
to let us go,

1009
01:33:58,245 --> 01:34:00,612
这样你就可以参加了。
在你自己的生活中
so that you could attend to
matters in your own life,

1010
01:34:00,614 --> 01:34:02,747
我也可以这么做
and I could do the same.

1011
01:34:05,585 --> 01:34:08,786
我知道教堂
背叛了我们…
I know that the Church
has betrayed us...

1012
01:34:10,090 --> 01:34:18,062
它把我们排除在外。
这是……心碎……
and it's excluded us, and
it's been... heart breaking...

1013
01:34:18,064 --> 01:34:19,864
但当你
结束了
but when you're
wrapped up in it,

1014
01:34:19,866 --> 01:34:21,699
没有它我就活不下去。
I can't live without it.

1015
01:34:29,976 --> 01:34:34,646
-我知道这是真的。
疯狂的过去几
- I know it's been really
crazy the last couple

1016
01:34:34,648 --> 01:34:38,383
几个星期，对我来说，
我很抱歉……
of weeks, and for my part,
I apologize for that...

1017
01:34:43,623 --> 01:34:44,956
但如果它教会了我什么，
but if it's taught me anything,

1018
01:34:44,958 --> 01:34:47,892
人生苦短。
it's that life is way too short.

1019
01:34:49,229 --> 01:34:53,331
这是我第一次。
生活，我知道我想要什么
For the first time in my
life, I know what I want

1020
01:34:53,333 --> 01:34:54,832
和我想要的。
and who I want.

1021
01:34:56,903 --> 01:34:58,303
我想要你。
I want you.

1022
01:35:01,575 --> 01:35:06,945
还有Kaylee和教堂，
我希望这一切……
And Kaylee, and the Church,
I want it all...

1023
01:35:08,081 --> 01:35:09,948
因为我们应得的。
because we deserve it.

1024
01:35:10,684 --> 01:35:12,317
-我也想要。
- I want it all, too.

1025
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:14,686
我想要的一切。
I want everything.

1026
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:18,556
它和我们一样属于我们。
它属于任何人……
It belongs to us as much as
it belongs to anyone else...

1027
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:24,696
没人能告诉我们。
我们的选择是……
and nobody can tell us
what our options are...

1028
01:35:24,698 --> 01:35:26,998
我也不想
and I don't want to
fuck around anymore.

1029
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:39,544
-嗯，我有一个完整的。
另一件事。
- Well, I had this whole
other thing planned.

1030
01:35:47,821 --> 01:35:51,255
我最近打电话给你爸爸…
I called your dad recently...

1031
01:35:53,426 --> 01:35:58,596
我打电话给他的原因是。
请求他允许和他儿子结婚。
and the reason I called him was to
ask his permission to marry his son.

1032
01:36:23,623 --> 01:36:25,289
你愿意嫁给我吗?
Will you marry me?

1033
01:36:29,195 --> 01:36:33,498
Yes...

1034
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,533
I love you.

1035
01:36:36,636 --> 01:36:38,403
- I love you so much.

1036
01:36:46,913 --> 01:36:49,714
我再也不会离开你了。
I will never leave you again.

1037
01:37:03,363 --> 01:37:05,997
你需要一些纸巾？
You need some tissue?

1038
01:37:05,999 --> 01:37:07,498
- No, no I'm okay.

1039
01:37:09,436 --> 01:37:11,936
我要赶飞机。
- I have a plane to catch.

1040
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:14,439
-你说过你不会离开的。
就这一次。
- You said you would never leave.
- Just this once.

1041
01:37:14,441 --> 01:37:16,274
- Okay.
- Okay.

1042
01:37:24,684 --> 01:37:27,719
-我们亲爱的天父，
我们非常感激
- Our dear Heavenly Father,
we're so very grateful

1043
01:37:27,721 --> 01:37:32,356
在这幸福的日子里。
在这里，和这两个年轻人。
for this blessed day, to be
here, with these two young men.

1044
01:37:32,358 --> 01:37:35,059
我们祈祷你
灵魂将与我们同在，
We pray that thy
spirit will be with us,

1045
01:37:35,061 --> 01:37:37,929

我们祈祷一切都会好起来。
丰富的经验
We pray that all will be
enriched by this experience

1048
01:37:43,036 --> 01:37:44,502
我们今天离开,
as we leave today,

1049
01:37:44,504 --> 01:37:47,739
我们将永远。
记得对待你的孩子。
and that we will always
remember to treat thy children

1050
01:37:47,741 --> 01:37:52,009
爱的极致，
善良,耐心,
with the utmost of love,
kindness, and patience,

1051
01:37:52,011 --> 01:37:54,612

and we ask these things
humbly in the name of thy Son,

2016年12月,
俄勒冈州波特兰市
in December of 2016,
in Portland, Oregon,

1065
01:39:43,056 --> 01:39:45,656
我们的家人都在那里，
our families were both there,

1066
01:39:45,658 --> 01:39:48,359
包括我的继女Kaylee.
including my stepdaughter
Kaylee.

1067
01:39:51,164 --> 01:39:53,965
我很快就到
盐湖。
I soon moved to
Salt Lake with them.

1068
01:39:55,869 --> 01:39:57,969
我找到了一份工作。
兼职教授
I got a job as an
adjunct professor

1069
01:39:57,971 --> 01:40:04,675

at the University of Utah,
and I finished my new book.

1070
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:11,749
在犹他大学，
我完成了我的新书。
I finally found a way to join the
two opposing sides of myself.

1071
01:40:16,389 --> 01:40:22,093
我终于找到了一种加入的方法。
我的两个对立面。
My first day in our home,
we knelt down and prayed.

1072
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:30,635
克里斯轻声对我说，
“就是这样。
Chris said to me softly,
"This is it."

1073
01:40:33,406 --> 01:40:35,172
这就是我们所拥有的。
This is what we have.

1074
01:40:38,344 --> 01:40:41,579
“这是我们
争取。”
"This is what we've
been fighting for."

1075
01:40:42,782 --> 01:40:48,019
他说一切都值得……
他是对的。
He said it was all worth it...
and he was right.
