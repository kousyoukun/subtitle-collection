1
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:56,774
- I still don't
know where we fit in the world.

2
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:04,281
I thought leaving faith
behind would relieve

3
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:06,717
the dissonance I always felt.

4
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:10,822
It didn't.

5
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:20,330
Through it all, I find myself
holding onto these values.

6
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:25,202
So does Chris, my former
mission companion.

7
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:29,139
For one reason or
another, we've had trouble

8
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,508
finding our way.

9
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,115
It's been a year
since I've seen him,

10
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:41,885
and tomorrow, he comes
back to the Northwest.

11
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:47,157
We've agreed to put it all
behind us and start fresh,

12
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:52,229
uninhibited by the Church,
our families, distance,

13
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,697
or anything else.

14
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,533
We deserve that.

15
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:00,070
Everyone does.

16
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:33,338
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:36,773
I cannot believe you're
going to be here tomorrow.

18
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,342
- I know.

19
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:41,278
- I can introduce you to
all my friends finally.

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,081
- I can introduce
you to my friend.

21
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,083
- Hi.

22
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:50,287
- Hi, Kaylee.
- Hi.

23
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,488
- How are you?

24
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,789
- Good.

25
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,559
- You are so cute, I
can't even stand it.

26
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,361
- It's past her bedtime.

27
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:58,495
Do you want to say goodnight?

28
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:01,198
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Kaylee.

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,034
- All right, wanna take Gillian,
and go brush all your guys' teeth.

30
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,335
God bless you.

31
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,870
- Gesundheit.

32
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,806
- I'll be in tuck you
in just a sec, okay.

33
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:16,213
- I'm so excited to see you.

34
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:19,583
- I know, it'll be
good to see you, too.

35
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,254
I better hit the hay as well.

36
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:26,990
- Yeah, um...

37
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,300
Uh... so I know that
we discussed this,

38
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:38,135
and I know that you're
trying to figure it all out,

39
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:41,271
but I just want to say that...

40
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:43,140
you know,
she's more than welcome

41
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:46,176
to come up with you
next time you come up,

42
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,711
if that's okay.

43
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:52,649
- Yeah, no, I'll
think about that.

44
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:54,685
- Okay, great.

45
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,488
- Well, goodnight,
I'll see you soon.

46
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,990
- Yeah, goodnight.

47
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:07,531
I love you, I love you, Chris.

48
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:10,601
Just... I love you.

49
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:15,639
Why can't I just say that
like a normal person?

50
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:18,575
- RJ?

51
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,844
- Okay, yeah, hi.

52
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,947
- Hi, no, I'm still here, did
you want me to hang up?

53
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,817
- Well, sure that'd be...
- Or I can.

54
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,552
Not that I want
to hang up on you.

55
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:30,721
- No, I know.
- Okay.

56
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:34,358
- Alright, goodnight.
- Yep, goodnight.

57
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,792
- Bye.

58
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:28,779
Hey.

59
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:36,586
- Thanks for coming to get me.

60
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:38,855
- You look good.

61
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:41,358
- Thank you.
- I think I lost a little weight.

62
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,893
- It looks good.

63
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,261
- Thanks.

64
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:04,848
I'm really happy you're here.

65
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,286
I didn't think you'd ever
speak to me again after the...

66
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:12,422
- I said I forgive you,
and I meant it.

67
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,791
I just think people were
legitimately confused

68
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:17,327
why two men were kissing at
my parents' anniversary party.

69
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:18,428
- I was trying to
make a statement.

70
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,831
- Well, mission accomplished.

71
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,369
- You know I'm excited for
you to meet Adina and Sheris.

72
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:28,071
- Yeah, they sound great.

73
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,706
- Any my friend Ryan.

74
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,475
- Oh he is the
returning missionary

75
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:33,076
you were telling me about?

76
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:37,481
Great.

77
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,237
- Yeah, I'll be there.

78
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,207
Okay, give her my love, please.

79
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:08,245
Alright, thank you.

80
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:10,046
Okay, bye.

81
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:13,550
Sometimes it feels
like I'm still married.

82
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:17,888
Thanks.

83
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:31,668
- You hungry?

84
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:33,737
- I could eat.

85
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:07,637
- Am I that hard to be around?

86
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,076
- No.

87
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,643
- So how is life after
pharmaceutical sales?

88
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:16,680
- Well, I haven't heard
back from any of the schools

89
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:17,948
that I've applied to.

90
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,383
I've got my heart set on
sticking close to home.

91
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:25,222
What about you, how's work?

92
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:26,923
- Work's going well.

93
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:31,995
I haven't written anything
original in a while.

94
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,009
- I forgot to tell
you my sister read

95
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,744
one of your books.

96
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:49,112
- Oh, which one?

97
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:51,715
- The really dirty one.

98
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:54,217
- Yeah, tell her I'm sorry.

99
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,419
- It's just that she knew
you were talking about me,

100
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:57,854
and it was like...

101
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:59,422
- I know that's why
I'm apologizing.

102
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,691
How is Chelsea?

103
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:04,995
- She's good, it's Greg
that I don't talk to,

104
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:07,764
but you already knew that.

105
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,200
- Do they know that you're
here with me right now?

106
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:12,135
- My Mom does.

107
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:15,739
My Dad, he's...

108
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:20,877
- Let's loosen up.

109
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:22,112
- Okay.

110
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,288
- No, I don't drink.

111
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,324
- Come on, you have
no where else to be.

112
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:42,666
How often do I get to see you?

113
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,503
- Alright, I'll do one.

114
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,254
- Another one?

115
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:07,257
- You know you can't get me drunk.
- I just got here.

116
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,060
- I'm not trying to get you
drunk, it's just happening.

117
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:50,934
- Why does it take us so
long to get comfortable?

118
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:52,268
- I don't know.

119
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:59,042
I feel like I still get...
nervous around you.

120
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:00,677
- Yeah, I get nervous, too.

121
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,245
- After all this time.

122
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:06,583
- Yeah, we're just
two fluttering hearts.

123
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:54,798
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

124
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,974
- You know, I think I can do

125
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,743
this whole Northwest thing.

126
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,547
- What? You are doing it.

127
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:11,748
- What?

128
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,951
- You're hanging out
with gay, bearded men,

129
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:16,419
and you're drinking beer.

130
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:20,557
- And what about the
Salt Lake City thing?

131
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,891
- What about it?

132
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:25,095
- Could you do it?

133
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:27,897
- I think you
could barely do it.

134
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:31,901
- Well, maybe you won't have to.

135
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,310
- Okay.

136
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,945
- Where are you going?

137
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:44,414
- I am headed back to your
house to get some more beer.

138
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,482
- I thought you said
you weren't drinking.

139
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:49,018
- You, sir, have
opened the flood gates.

140
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,020
I'm past the point of no return.

141
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:53,123
- You can't just say
that and then walk away.

142
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,624
- Too late.

143
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:55,892
- Come on, ugh.

144
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:08,238
You'll be okay.

145
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:14,410
- I think it's...
- It's a little dry.

146
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:17,614
We'll be okay.

147
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:19,649
- I'm good.

148
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:31,394
- Hey did you...
- sleep with anybody else

149
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,163
since I saw you last?

150
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:37,133
- I had sex with
Paul after Salt Lake.

151
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,635
- I knew about that.

152
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,204
I saw you after that.

153
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:44,207
- Yeah, I just didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

154
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,209
- Don't worry about it.

155
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:52,182
Was there anybody else?

156
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:57,754
- Um, like a night here, and a
night there, but nothing real.

157
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:06,996
- Yeah, I had to break a
couple bad habits myself.

158
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,798
- What makes them bad?

159
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,303
- Just, oing places, and...

160
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,410
meeting people.

161
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,622
What do you think about that?

162
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:37,694
- I think that we shouldn't
feel like we're bad people

163
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:39,095
all the time.

164
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:44,167
It's okay to have sex, you
know, we're supposed to cum.

165
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:46,536
We're supposed to cum.

166
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:50,440
We are animals, it's okay.

167
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,776
We're okay.

168
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:59,549
- You're not, you're
not going to judge me?

169
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,950
- No.

170
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:05,221
- I just wanted to get
it all out in the open.

171
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:08,091
- Yeah, it's fine.

172
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:14,063
We can get everything
out in the open.

173
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:19,636
Every last thing we can
get out in the open.

174
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:28,511
Three, two... one.

175
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:38,981
- Hey.

176
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:46,422
Good morning.

177
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:52,095
Do you want some coffee?

178
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,863
- I am a Mormon, sir.

179
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,133
- So now you're a Mormon?

180
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,135
- Amen.

181
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:07,910
- Get up, get up.

182
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:12,081
Get up.

183
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,055
- Oh.

184
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:20,289
- What?

185
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,391
- My breath.

186
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:23,860
- I don't mind, come on.

187
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,495
- I do.

188
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:28,664
- Come on, go.

189
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,876
I wasn't ready for that.

190
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,111
- Then why did you
tell me to do it?

191
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:45,248
- I'm just kidding.

192
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:54,457
I'll go make us some breakfast.

193
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:20,483
Hey, how do you want
your eggs cooked?

194
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,128
- Everything's so bright.

195
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,198
- It's called day.

196
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:40,136
- Thank you for breakfast.

197
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:41,571
- You're welcome.

198
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:48,044
- Where does your
head hurt, there?

199
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:49,712
- Right here. Oh.

200
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:58,120
- Well, you gotta
drink more water.

201
00:18:58,122 --> 00:18:59,622
Keep going.

202
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:06,596
Here, I'm going to
get you some more.

203
00:19:06,598 --> 00:19:08,631
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,045
- "New IDS guidelines say
children of same-sex couples...

205
00:19:56,047 --> 00:19:59,048
will not be baptized
in the Church."

206
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,058
I know you want to discuss this,

207
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,459
but if you'll just
give me a moment

208
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,541
- to read the whole article.
- They're joking, right?

209
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:21,404
It says they're doing this
for their own protection,

210
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:24,173
that children from gay
marriages can't be treated

211
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,808
like everyone else.

212
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:32,448
Punishing children for
the sins of their own fathers.

213
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,051
We don't even believe in that.

214
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:40,756
You can interpret
this any way you want,

215
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:41,991
but I am done.

216
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:45,795
- I don't think you mean that.

217
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:53,102
- That's Adina.

218
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:57,239
- Hello, hi!

219
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,275
- Hi.
- Hi!

220
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:03,779
I'm Adina, I've heard
so much about you.

221
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:05,047
- I'm Chris.

222
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,983
- Yeah, I know.

223
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:09,585
- Nice to meet you.

224
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:12,722
- Yeah, what's this?

225
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:13,789
- What?

226
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:15,925
- The love of your
life is finally here,

227
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,360
and you make him this?

228
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:19,395
- Well, it's all I had.

229
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:28,537
- Where's Sheris?

230
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,272
- Not sure.

231
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:32,041
- Is everything okay?

232
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:35,411
- No, but I'll be fine.

233
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:43,152
Come on.

234
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:44,620
- What?

235
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:46,389
- I'm a lip kisser, come on.

236
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:47,623
- Oh?

237
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:53,763
- What, you were married
to a woman once, you'll be fine.

238
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,370
- He has soft lips.

239
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:11,313
Back and forth?

240
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:12,682
Back and forth?

241
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,383
Yeah, you know it's like...

242
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:15,584
- No, that's up and down.

243
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,786
- Together.

244
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:18,387
- I assume that people
poop up and down.

245
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:20,756
- Okay, moving on,
having anuses for eyes.

246
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:23,292
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

247
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:26,095
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

248
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:27,663
- Hey. Ryan.
- Chris.

249
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:29,598
- Oh, it's great to
finally meet you.

250
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,733
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

251
00:22:30,735 --> 00:22:32,001
- Hey.

252
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:33,536
- Ryan.
- Anya.

253
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:35,337
- Steve. Nice to meet you.

254
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:37,206
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

255
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:40,609
- Oh, you guys
started without me?

256
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,078
- Yeah, we had
some really great ones,

257
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,124
but you can still deal
yourself in though.

258
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:43,746
But you gotta catch up.

259
00:22:43,748 --> 00:22:45,848
- Yeah take seven and pick two.

260
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:48,551
- Chris, how long
are you in town for?

261
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:49,952
- Oh just through tomorrow.

262
00:22:49,954 --> 00:22:51,687
- You have work or?

263
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:53,055
- I have a
six-year-old daughter.

264
00:22:53,057 --> 00:22:54,957
- Oh!
- Really?

265
00:22:55,893 --> 00:22:57,526
- And what do you do Ryan?

266
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:58,794
- Oh, I'm a masseur.

267
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:01,163
- How long have you
been doing that?

268
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:04,133
- Oh, I actually just graduated,
so I'm just starting out.

269
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:07,269
Actually RJ is my only client.

270
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:08,571
- You're only client?

271
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:10,106
- Yeah, I'm hoping
it'll take off.

272
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:13,075
It's mostly word of mouth,
but he's giving me lots

273
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:14,677
of practice.

274
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:18,948
We all know how
tense he gets, right.

275
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,951
- Wow, maybe like a
website or business cards.

276
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:25,254
- Yeah, you know, I gotta
handle that side as well.

277
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:28,257
I'm feeling it out, literally.

278
00:23:30,228 --> 00:23:32,261
- Good card.
- It's so accurate, too.

279
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:34,163
- Your turn.
- Oh, sure, okay.

280
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:36,432
- Lifetime presents, A
Sad Handjob: The Story

281
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:39,301
of a Homoerotic
Volleyball Montage.

282
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:41,504
- I'd watch that.

283
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:48,144
- I can't believe I'm
smoking pot with you, Chris.

284
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,179
Your dad's a member
of the Quorum.

285
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:51,781
- Yes he is.

286
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:54,216
- Yeah, that's a tough
one for us right now.

287
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:58,487
- Yeah, I heard...
- but to be expected.

288
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:03,425
- So where did you serve
your mission, Ryan?

289
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:06,529
- I spent my mission
in Mexico City

290
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:13,869
It was beautiful...
and so was my companion.

291
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,476
For a year straight...

292
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:25,181
he would always change
in front of me...

293
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:29,485
totally innocent,
but he knew what he was doing.

294
00:24:31,923 --> 00:24:34,323
And then one night,
we were on a bus

295
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:38,761
heading back to our district, and
I fell asleep on his shoulder.

296
00:24:38,763 --> 00:24:42,131
While I was sleeping,
he had taken my hand,

297
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:45,434
and he was holding it
in a patriarchal grip.

298
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:49,872
I woke up... like this...

299
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:53,042
and I looked up
into his eyes, and...

300
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:58,080
I saw a lust and love
and longing...

301
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:05,921
but I also saw
this deep sadness...

302
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:11,227
because we both knew

303
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:15,264
we could never be together...

304
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:20,369
and it would just be this moment
in the back of a bus.

305
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,141
We got sent home shortly after.

306
00:25:27,912 --> 00:25:30,045
I haven't seen him since.

307
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,959
But seeing you guys
together after so long...

308
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,427
it gives me hope.

309
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:50,099
I'm going to go.

310
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:52,368
- Really?

311
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,538
- Yeah...
- It was nice to meet you.

312
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,907
- Yeah, you too.

313
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,209
- Are you okay?

314
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:01,944
- Not really.

315
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:04,346
- Hey, hey, hey...

316
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:12,521
Love you.

317
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:14,857
- Love you, too.

318
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:27,102
- Where did you guys meet?

319
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:28,971
- Um, we met at Affirmations.

320
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:30,965
It's like a support group
for recovering Mormons.

321
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,065
- Yeah, I know what it is.

322
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:36,679
- Yeah, his parents kicked
him out of the house.

323
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:38,113
- Wow.

324
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:41,684
- I don't know,
I feel bad for him.

325
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,487
He's out here without
no family or friends.

326
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:48,757
- Wow.

327
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:52,628
- You okay?

328
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:55,030
- Yeah.

329
00:26:58,369 --> 00:26:59,702
- You coming?

330
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,769
- Yeah.

331
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:09,611
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

332
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:25,961
- Have you and Ryan ever...?

333
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:30,566
- No.

334
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:41,710
- He sure loves you.

335
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,120
- Do you love me?

336
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:38,720
- Do you want some water?

337
00:30:38,722 --> 00:30:40,189
What are those?

338
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:43,392
- Oh, I have pressure
points in my back.

339
00:30:43,394 --> 00:30:45,194
- What's wrong with your back?

340
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:49,498
- Just all those years of
carrying around a heavy suitcase.

341
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:54,336
- Thank you.

342
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:55,637
- Yeah.

343
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:06,448
- Whoa, it got chilly.

344
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,531
Can I ask you something?

345
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:23,565
- Sure.

346
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:28,136
- Would you consider going to
a sacrament meeting with me?

347
00:31:30,874 --> 00:31:34,943
- Chris, I just don't
know what the point is.

348
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:36,678
- I don't think it's
coincidence that you live

349
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,014
only a few blocks
away from the war.

350
00:31:39,016 --> 00:31:41,717
It's not too late to come back.

351
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:43,585
- Where do you think I've gone?

352
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:46,722
- Not far, unless all of that
stuff in your living room

353
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,090
is just for show.

354
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:50,292
- I'm still trying to figure
out what they're trying

355
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:52,761
to say with this announcement.

356
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:59,868
By the way...
did you know?

357
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,870
- What?

358
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:04,172
- About the policy, did
you know before they made

359
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,507
the announcement?

360
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:08,210
- No... You honestly think
that I knew about that.

361
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:13,048
- I don't know, I just... I don't
know, I thought that if you did,

362
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,051
maybe there was something
you could've done about it.

363
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:18,153
- I don't know.
- Like what?

364
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:20,789
- Talk to your father.

365
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,659
- What possible
good would that do?

366
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:31,033
- I don't know, he's
like an inside voice.

367
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:34,069
One of the twelve
apostles has a gay son.

368
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:35,404
I mean if that's not a prophecy,

369
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:39,408
then I don't know what is.

370
00:32:43,681 --> 00:32:45,947
Do you ever think about it?

371
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:49,718
What it would be like?

372
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,686
- What?

373
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,188
- I think about it
all the time...

374
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,025
with you, getting married...

375
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:05,334
in the Church with
the Sealer above us,

376
00:33:05,336 --> 00:33:07,803
my parents and your parents.

377
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:15,944
I do... but it's not
going to happen.

378
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:18,447
Not like that.

379
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,784
You know what the Church does?

380
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:25,454
They convince me more and
more that maybe Joseph Smith

381
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:27,289
really did make it all up.

382
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,890
- Don't do that.

383
00:33:28,892 --> 00:33:30,959
- How can you be a part of
something that alienates

384
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:34,029
parents from their children?

385
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:36,565
Don't you understand
what this means for you?

386
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,633
- I've stuck with the
Church through all of its

387
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:41,236
flaws and idiosyncrasies,
just like I've stuck with you

388
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,105
through all of these years.

389
00:33:43,107 --> 00:33:45,073
- What are you talking about?

390
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:47,175
I'm done with it,
I've had my fill.

391
00:33:47,177 --> 00:33:49,678
- No, you gave up,
that's different.

392
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,480
- And you don't have
the courage to leave.

393
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,215
- I don't want to leave.

394
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:56,585
- How are you okay with
the way the treat you,

395
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,921
or the way they treat your
family or your daughter?

396
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,757
As a father, how
do you accept that?

397
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,192
- Everything I do is for her.

398
00:34:05,262 --> 00:34:07,462
You can question my beliefs
as a man of the faith,

399
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,899
but don't you ever question
my devotion to my daughter.

400
00:34:10,901 --> 00:34:12,300
- I'm sorry.

401
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:17,806
I'm sorry.

402
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:23,211
- What am I doing here?

403
00:34:24,948 --> 00:34:26,848
What am I doing?

404
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:33,088
I just feel obligated
to you, you know.

405
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,291
I just keep coming
back and coming back

406
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:38,727
because it's all that I know.

407
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:40,962
- Wow.

408
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,712
- Ricky?

409
00:35:00,217 --> 00:35:04,186
- Hey... are you alright?

410
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,587
Hey.

411
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:07,289
What's wrong?

412
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:09,191
Are you alright?

413
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:12,093
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy,

414
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:13,562
Okay.

415
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:19,401
What's wrong? Hey, look at me...
I'm right here.

416
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:25,173
Breathe... Are you alright?

417
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:27,309
- I get these sometimes.

418
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:32,314
- Hey, hey... Alright,

419
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,283
Alright.

420
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:13,588
Back to real life.

421
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:16,925
- This is real life.

422
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:24,533
I'm sorry we keep
fucking things up.

423
00:36:24,535 --> 00:36:26,935
- You don't have to be sorry.

424
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:40,382
- Okay.

425
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:55,617
- Thanks.

426
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:53,942
- Call Chris.

427
00:39:56,446 --> 00:39:59,280
- Say the list
number of the one you...

428
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:01,449
Calling the mobile
number for Chris.

429
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:16,064
- Hello.

430
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:21,236
- Chris, Chris, I just heard.

431
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:23,304
I'm so sorry.

432
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:25,607
Is there anything I can I do?

433
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:30,634
Would you consider
coming to Salt Lake?

434
00:40:30,646 --> 00:40:31,646
Yeah.

435
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:34,983
- I can make
all the arrangements.

436
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:37,285
- No, don't worry about it.
- I'll get there.

437
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:41,256
- The service is tomorrow.

438
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:42,524
- Yeah, that's fine.

439
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:46,594
- Okay,
I'll send you all the details.

440
00:40:46,596 --> 00:40:48,062
I'll see you soon.

441
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:49,664
- Are you okay?

442
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:58,339
- It'll just be
good to have you here.

443
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:00,775
- Yeah, I want to
be there with you.

444
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:03,778
- I'll see you soon, RJ.

445
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,648
- Okay, I love you.

446
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:16,491
- Elder Merrill's
gonna pitch a fit when he sees you.

447
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:19,894
I think I'd like
to be there with you.

448
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,930
- Uh...

449
00:41:22,866 --> 00:41:25,500
- I just-I think I should
do it alone.

450
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:31,406
- Look, son,
I never told you this, but...

451
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:35,844
I had a conversation with him.

452
00:41:35,846 --> 00:41:37,278
- Wait, when?

453
00:41:38,648 --> 00:41:43,017
- We talked when you were
in Salt Lake City with Chris.

454
00:41:44,888 --> 00:41:47,622
I was a bit direct.

455
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:50,425
- How so?

456
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:53,094
- Doesn't matter now.

457
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,496
Back then I had my reasons.

458
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,269
- Um... okay.

459
00:42:03,006 --> 00:42:05,039
What does Mom think?

460
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:08,776
- She backs me up on this.

461
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:11,112
- What about your foot?

462
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:13,414
- It'll be fine, RJ.

463
00:42:16,152 --> 00:42:17,685
- Okay.

464
00:42:18,855 --> 00:42:21,890
- Alright, son, I'll see you
in the morning in Salt Lake.

465
00:42:21,892 --> 00:42:23,691
- Yeah, I'll see
you in the morning.

466
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:25,493
- Alright, bye.
- Bye.

467
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:33,001
- Where are you headed today?

468
00:42:33,003 --> 00:42:34,068
- Uh, Utah.

469
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:36,838
- Will you be checking
any bags today?

470
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,206
- No thanks.

471
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,342
- There you go, sir,
have a good flight.

472
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:42,844
- Thank you.

473
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,967
- Hi, thank you.

474
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:22,610
Hey.

475
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,918
Hi.
Thank you for coming.

476
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,654
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

477
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:48,703
- Hi, Kaylee.

478
00:44:48,705 --> 00:44:50,071
- Hi.

479
00:44:50,073 --> 00:44:51,339
- You look really pretty.

480
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:53,041
- Thank you.
- I like your shoes.

481
00:44:53,043 --> 00:44:54,509
- Thank you.

482
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:55,977
- She gets a little shy.

483
00:44:55,979 --> 00:44:57,345
- It's okay.

484
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:07,755
- I'm glad you're here.

485
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:09,123
- Me too.

486
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,329
- Hey, shall I take
her for a little why?

487
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:18,021
Yeah absolutely, you wanna
go with Grandma, honey?

488
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:18,933
Yeah.

489
00:45:18,935 --> 00:45:21,335
I'll see you later, sweetie.

490
00:45:29,546 --> 00:45:30,645
You look good.

491
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,680
- You too.
- Thanks.

492
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:36,551
- I'm sorry.
- It's a very tough situation.

493
00:45:36,553 --> 00:45:39,620
- It's challenging, yeah.
- Yeah.

494
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:41,589
- Are you okay?

495
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:44,258
- Yeah, he's walking over here.

496
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:48,930
- It's gonna be fine.
- I'm right here.

497
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:51,099
- I think they're
starting to recognize me.

498
00:45:51,101 --> 00:45:52,800
- They probably are.

499
00:45:54,537 --> 00:45:56,604
Hey, just don't kiss me.

500
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:01,175
Sorry, that wasn't funny.

501
00:46:07,984 --> 00:46:10,902
- RJ.

502
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:13,821
- Elder Merrill, I want you to
know I'm very sorry for your loss.

503
00:46:13,823 --> 00:46:15,556
- I appreciate that.

504
00:46:16,526 --> 00:46:18,793
Chris didn't tell me
that you were coming.

505
00:46:18,795 --> 00:46:20,528
- I invited him, Dad.

506
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,732
- Elder Merrill,
I'm Tom Smith, RJ's father.

507
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:26,300
- Oh, right.

508
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:31,405
- I can't begin to know what
you're going through right now.

509
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:35,710
Saying sorry isn't enough
to express my sympathies.

510
00:46:38,014 --> 00:46:40,748
- Thank you, Brother Smith.

511
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,784
- And you must be Chris, brother Smith.
- Yes.

512
00:46:46,022 --> 00:46:49,257
I've heard so many
great things about you.

513
00:46:50,693 --> 00:46:51,959
Welcome.

514
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:53,861
What happened?

515
00:46:53,863 --> 00:46:55,530
- Oh, an accident at work.

516
00:46:56,399 --> 00:47:00,268
- Elder Smith,
I thought that was you.

517
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,837
How are you?

518
00:47:10,146 --> 00:47:11,879
- RJ, are you okay, son?

519
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:13,481
- I'm sorry.

520
00:47:13,883 --> 00:47:15,249
- RJ?

521
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:20,054
- Excuse me.

522
00:47:28,565 --> 00:47:30,932
Easy, hey, easy.

523
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:34,535
- I'm so sorry.

524
00:47:34,537 --> 00:47:35,537
- It's okay.

525
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:37,872
- That was so weird.
- Yeah.

526
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:42,243
- Our mission president...

527
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:45,613
and the look that your father
gave me, he hates me.

528
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:48,616
- Okay. Okay.
- He doesn't hate you.

529
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:50,484
- I just wanted to
be here for you.

530
00:47:50,486 --> 00:47:54,322
- You are, you're here.

531
00:47:54,324 --> 00:47:56,357
Rest.

532
00:47:57,994 --> 00:48:00,328
Easy, easy, easy.

533
00:48:01,898 --> 00:48:05,633
There we go, there
we go, there we go.

534
00:48:11,874 --> 00:48:13,474
- They're gonna be alright.

535
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:16,043
- Yeah, why don't you
and RJ stick around,

536
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:18,145
and we'll get some dinner?

537
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:21,449
- Oh, Elder Merrill, I couldn't
intrude on your mourning.

538
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:22,516
- We need to have a talk.

539
00:48:22,518 --> 00:48:24,952
We need to have a
candid conversation,

540
00:48:24,954 --> 00:48:26,687
and I would like you and RJ

541
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:29,890
to join us for dinner tonight,
alright?

542
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:31,092
- Absolutely.

543
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:32,593
- Good, thank you.

544
00:48:56,753 --> 00:48:58,919
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

545
00:49:05,728 --> 00:49:08,529
So, I hear you're
going to law school.

546
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:10,064
- I'm still applying.

547
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:11,532
- I bet your mother was proud.

548
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:12,967
- Yeah, she was.

549
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,172
As far as she was concerned,
I was already practicing law.

550
00:49:18,174 --> 00:49:21,242
- My old mission companion
became an attorney.

551
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:25,146
I saw him and some of my
other companions recently.

552
00:49:25,148 --> 00:49:30,584
We met up for a night, and
life didn't skip a beat,

553
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:32,620
let me tell you.

554
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:35,423
We picked up right
where we left off.

555
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:38,659
We shared our blessings,
and our tragedies,

556
00:49:38,661 --> 00:49:42,530
love and heartbreak.

557
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:49,570
Some of them... I had no idea
what they were going through

558
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:51,172
back then.

559
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,545
It's nice to have
people in your life

560
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:59,447
you can depend on.

561
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:05,186
- I'm Greg, Chris's brother.

562
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:07,722
- Thomas Smith, RJ's father.

563
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:09,123
- It's good to see you again.

564
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,624
- Thank you.

565
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:20,801
Did you know my mother?

566
00:50:20,803 --> 00:50:24,105
- Okay, Greg, I know that
you don't care much for me,

567
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:25,806
so maybe we should...

568
00:50:25,808 --> 00:50:29,910
- I would like to sit
here and mourn my mother

569
00:50:29,912 --> 00:50:33,080
without the shadow
of my brother's past

570
00:50:33,082 --> 00:50:35,616
looming over this sacred moment.

571
00:50:38,388 --> 00:50:40,354
- I'm sorry.
- May I have that?

572
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:42,523
- You're really going to
do this right now, Greg?

573
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:46,427
- Our father asked me to
be here, and here I am.

574
00:50:49,265 --> 00:50:50,564
Dad.

575
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:55,336
- Boys, Brother Smith, RJ.

576
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:56,804
- Elder Merrill.

577
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:58,305
- Good to see you.

578
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:07,081
- I didn't know what to get, so I
got a variety of foods, pad Thai.

579
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:09,150
- I hope Thai is
good for everyone.

580
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:12,887
We didn't have much left
after the reception, so...

581
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:16,056
Looks good, nice and hot.

582
00:51:16,058 --> 00:51:18,225
Brother Smith, would
you like to pray for us?

583
00:51:18,227 --> 00:51:21,562
- Elder Merrill, I'd
be honored if a member

584
00:51:21,564 --> 00:51:23,731
of the Quorum would
say a blessing.

585
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:27,535
- Okay, call me Noah, alright?

586
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:29,603
- Let's pray.

587
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:36,043
Our Heavenly Father,
thank you for bringing

588
00:51:36,045 --> 00:51:39,880
Tom and RJ safely to us
today and as our families

589
00:51:39,882 --> 00:51:42,316
come together, please help
us guide our conversation,

590
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,220
help us discover what
is best for everyone,

591
00:51:46,222 --> 00:51:48,355
in the name of
Jesus Christ, Amen.

592
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:49,890
- Amen.

593
00:52:05,608 --> 00:52:08,242
- Brother Smith and RJ,
thank you both

594
00:52:08,244 --> 00:52:12,580
for being here today, it was
very gracious of you to come.

595
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:20,855
I have to make clear right
now and bear testimony

596
00:52:20,857 --> 00:52:23,724
to each of you that...

597
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:27,828
sexual relations

598
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,699
between two of the
same sex is wrong.

599
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:35,669
By doing so, our children
become apostates,

600
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:39,340
and should be culled
from the kingdom.

601
00:52:39,342 --> 00:52:42,743
Now the rest of the world may
be taking a different path,

602
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:46,447
but we remain faithful
to the Gospel.

603
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:49,316
- You've made some pretty
bold assumptions, Dad.

604
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:51,952
- I've seen it with
my own eyes, Chris.

605
00:52:51,954 --> 00:52:53,387
I've read his book.

606
00:52:54,657 --> 00:52:56,156
- There's a book?

607
00:52:56,158 --> 00:52:59,593
- It's a detailed account
of their mission together.

608
00:52:59,595 --> 00:53:02,363
And you, how do you feel
about this, having your

609
00:53:02,365 --> 00:53:05,232
adventures out there in
print for everyone to see?

610
00:53:05,234 --> 00:53:06,967
- I wouldn't want them in print.

611
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:09,904
- Well, no one would read
a book about you, Greg.

612
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:12,740
- Did you read the whole thing?

613
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:15,809
- I read as much as I could.

614
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:17,845
- What about the part when
they helped the veteran

615
00:53:17,847 --> 00:53:22,716
with PTSD make his peace with
heavenly Father and himself.

616
00:53:22,718 --> 00:53:24,385
Did you read that?

617
00:53:26,188 --> 00:53:28,889
- Your son and I fell in love.

618
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:34,695
We did things that people do
when they love each other.

619
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:39,366
- Faith isn't a Kinsey scale.

620
00:53:39,368 --> 00:53:41,268
You're either a man of faith,
or you're not.

621
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:45,539
- Elder Merrill, I can assure you, RJ...
- Dad.

622
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:48,008
Like it or not,
I'm in your life.

623
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:54,548
A man of God or not, I feel the
loss of this woman tonight,

624
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,617
and I feel it through him.

625
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:02,389
And he's a man that I love
and whose family I love.

626
00:54:08,998 --> 00:54:11,365
- My mother would've loved you.

627
00:54:13,336 --> 00:54:14,635
Just like I do.

628
00:54:27,249 --> 00:54:30,618
- So what's this
going to look like?

629
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,920
- What's what
going to look like?

630
00:54:32,922 --> 00:54:34,288
- This.

631
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:36,123
- What?

632
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,759
You two, with him in Seattle?

633
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:40,961
- Well, RJ moved
to Portland, Dad.

634
00:54:40,963 --> 00:54:43,030
- Well, that's the same thing.

635
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:44,498
Kaylee's in Salt Lake City.

636
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,105
- RJ and I aren't
together right now.

637
00:54:52,341 --> 00:54:54,975
- Wait a minute, I thought
that you guys were...

638
00:54:56,212 --> 00:54:57,212
ya know.

639
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:01,915
- Yeah why not? I just heard
you say that you love him.

640
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:18,799
Do you mind if I ask
what the problem is?

641
00:55:21,604 --> 00:55:28,375
- The Church... and where
we fit inside of it all.

642
00:55:28,377 --> 00:55:29,710
We don't know.

643
00:55:34,483 --> 00:55:35,883
- I see.

644
00:55:46,162 --> 00:55:48,128
Thanks.

645
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:51,065
RJ, thank you for
being here for Chris.

646
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,833
- Mm-hmm.

647
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:07,014
- Thank you for coming.

648
00:56:32,675 --> 00:56:37,111
- Son, give me a hand.
- Thanks.

649
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:48,255
You know, RJ, I get it...
about Chris. I mean.

650
00:56:50,426 --> 00:56:53,761
Your mother and I
want the best for you, and...

651
00:56:55,431 --> 00:56:58,132
I can't think of anyone
better for you than him.

652
00:57:03,706 --> 00:57:09,009
I want you to know...
I'm proud of you, son.

653
00:57:10,446 --> 00:57:12,646
- For what?

654
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:16,216
- For...
- being a good human being...

655
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:25,793
and for having the fortitude
to... follow your heart.

656
00:57:29,932 --> 00:57:33,700
I knew someone in
your situation once.

657
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:41,642
He wasn't nearly as
courageous as you and Chris.

658
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:45,646
- Yeah, I think I remember
you talking about him.

659
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:51,385
Do you know what
happened to him?

660
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:57,391
Is he okay?

661
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:10,003
- He is... he's fine.

662
00:58:12,608 --> 00:58:14,474
- Well if you ever
want to talk about him,

663
00:58:14,476 --> 00:58:15,943
I'll listen.

664
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:20,280
- Thank you, son.

665
00:59:25,981 --> 00:59:27,581
- Have a seat.

666
00:59:29,351 --> 00:59:31,018
- Is Sheris here?

667
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,319
- She's asleep.

668
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:36,356
- Is everything okay?

669
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:38,425
- Yeah, we're fine.

670
00:59:38,427 --> 00:59:40,928
Now tell me about Salt Lake.

671
00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:45,666
- Well, it was really
sad and really sweet.

672
00:59:47,102 --> 00:59:51,405
And we said goodbye,
and... now I'm here.

673
00:59:52,808 --> 00:59:56,209
- Well that doesn't
make any sense.

674
00:59:57,546 --> 01:00:01,515
You guys have been at this
what, six, seven years.

675
01:00:01,517 --> 01:00:07,054
I love you, no I don't,
I'm Mormon, no I'm not.

676
01:00:07,056 --> 01:00:10,557
My parents will be mad if
we fuck, we shouldn't fuck.

677
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,193
Fucking is against our religion.

678
01:00:13,195 --> 01:00:15,228
If everyone would just
stop giving a fuck about

679
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,597
who everyone else was
fucking then there wouldn't

680
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,399
be a problem.

681
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:22,135
I don't care who anyone
fucks except for Sharis.

682
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:24,638
Why should I care about
who that guy fucks,

683
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,809
or that guy fucks, or that
guy fucks, or that guy fucks,

684
01:00:28,811 --> 01:00:30,978
it's all bullshit.

685
01:00:31,814 --> 01:00:33,146
- Yeah, I agree.

686
01:00:34,817 --> 01:00:39,152
- Good, so then what
are you afraid of?

687
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:43,090
- Nothing.

688
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:56,837
- You know there's a
community of people out there

689
01:00:56,839 --> 01:01:02,109
who love you and
want you to be happy

690
01:01:02,111 --> 01:01:06,513
and we want you to find love.

691
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,817
- You know, I could do it.

692
01:01:12,888 --> 01:01:19,559
I could-I could compromise if
it meant living a life with him.

693
01:01:20,996 --> 01:01:22,696
- So then why don't you?

694
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:28,368
- Because you're either gay,
or you're a man of faith...

695
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:31,171
but apparently
you can't be both.

696
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,443
- Hey.
- Hi.

697
01:01:41,884 --> 01:01:44,618
- You know, you can tell
her to stop talking.

698
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,053
That's what I do.

699
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:52,325
Waking me up.

700
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:54,728
Hi.

701
01:02:02,704 --> 01:02:05,005
I heard about Chris's mom.

702
01:02:08,877 --> 01:02:10,477
How are you doing?

703
01:02:11,713 --> 01:02:13,747
- Eh...

704
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:16,349
- Come here.

705
01:02:28,063 --> 01:02:31,698
- You make me feel like
a baby when you do that.

706
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,567
- Because you are one.

707
01:03:17,045 --> 01:03:19,846
- No, no, no.
- Do one more with me.

708
01:03:19,848 --> 01:03:22,649
- No, I'm good.
- Just one more, come on.

709
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:26,253
- No, really, I'm good.
- Fine.

710
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:30,891
- You are falling apart.

711
01:03:30,893 --> 01:03:36,229
- Am I? I think I'm
finally letting loose.

712
01:03:36,231 --> 01:03:38,331
- Well, you've been
letting loose for a while.

713
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:41,034
- Well, you need to loosen up.

714
01:03:55,284 --> 01:03:56,850
What do we do now?

715
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,988
- Well I pass out because I have
to go be an editor in the morning.

716
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:05,892
- No, no, no, I mean
your body of work.

717
01:04:05,894 --> 01:04:09,796
Those books on the shelf, they're
filled with your feelings

718
01:04:09,798 --> 01:04:11,331
about this man.

719
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:13,433
He was your muse.

720
01:04:16,505 --> 01:04:18,405
- I'll find a new one.

721
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:22,642
- I could be your muse.

722
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,478
I make a great muse.

723
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:28,548
- Yeah, you are.

724
01:04:36,725 --> 01:04:37,991
- What?

725
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,060
- Nothing.

726
01:05:33,448 --> 01:05:38,652
- Okay, okay,
no, okay, okay, okay.

727
01:05:40,756 --> 01:05:41,888
- He's not here.

728
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,723
- It's not about him.

729
01:05:44,826 --> 01:05:46,359
- You're attracted to me right?

730
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:48,795
- Of course, you're beautiful.

731
01:06:00,642 --> 01:06:05,578
Hey come on, please don't be...

732
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,615
Don't let this
be awkward between us.

733
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:10,550
- Too late.

734
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:13,186
- Look, I have feelings for you.

735
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:17,157
And they are
complicated feelings.

736
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,059
We just can't have sex.

737
01:06:20,262 --> 01:06:22,095
It'll mess it up.

738
01:06:22,097 --> 01:06:25,265
- We both know what it's
like to love something

739
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:29,169
that doesn't love
us back, don't we?

740
01:06:32,107 --> 01:06:36,409
- Ryan... come on.

741
01:06:36,912 --> 01:06:38,011
- What?

742
01:06:38,013 --> 01:06:40,347
- Come here, come on.

743
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:44,617
Come here.

744
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:03,603
- Do you still
believe in God, RJ?

745
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:09,376
Do you think that
He's here right now?

746
01:07:19,855 --> 01:07:23,256
Because I'm starting to
see our Heavenly Father...

747
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:29,996
like I see the Prophet
or the other leaders, as...

748
01:07:29,998 --> 01:07:32,332
flawed men.

749
01:07:34,002 --> 01:07:37,070
I don't want to
see Him like that.

750
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,642
I want to know that He's
here, and that He loves me.

751
01:07:46,248 --> 01:07:48,748
- Do you feel loved right now?

752
01:07:52,888 --> 01:07:54,821
- In this moment, I do.

753
01:07:58,994 --> 01:08:00,627
- Then maybe He is.

754
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:12,806
- I have to admit...

755
01:08:12,808 --> 01:08:16,810
I didn't want you and Chris
to work out.

756
01:08:16,812 --> 01:08:17,944
- I know that.

757
01:08:19,114 --> 01:08:22,348
- I just didn't want
to lose what we have.

758
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,821
- I am not what you want,
and I think you know that.

759
01:08:30,258 --> 01:08:34,060
- I looked at you guys,
and I thought to myself,

760
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:40,967
"I want that... I want that.

761
01:08:42,037 --> 01:08:44,437
Or something like that."

762
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:46,372
- You can have it.

763
01:08:49,511 --> 01:08:51,778
- I want a family some day, RJ.

764
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:53,980
I want a Temple wedding.

765
01:08:53,982 --> 01:08:56,483
I don't want to be told that
I'm going to be banished

766
01:08:56,485 --> 01:08:59,052
to the outer darkness
for wanting that.

767
01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:03,456
I have been to the dark places,

768
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:06,192
and I had to pull myself out.

769
01:09:09,264 --> 01:09:11,297
I don't want to go back there.

770
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:34,721
- You can have all of that,
but not if you're gone.

771
01:09:56,778 --> 01:09:58,511
- What do we do now?

772
01:10:06,888 --> 01:10:09,689
- We call your
mission companion.

773
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:12,325
- No, no we don't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

774
01:10:13,762 --> 01:10:18,097
- Come on is there a way to
get a hold of Elder Petersen?

775
01:10:20,101 --> 01:10:21,601
- Maybe.

776
01:10:23,171 --> 01:10:24,871
- Then let's call him.

777
01:10:24,873 --> 01:10:28,708
- It's probably not even
his number any more.

778
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:31,210
Besides he wouldn't
pick up, he's probably

779
01:10:31,212 --> 01:10:33,813
out with his friends
or something.

780
01:10:33,815 --> 01:10:36,549
At BYU, it's like 2 am.

781
01:10:37,686 --> 01:10:41,955
- Okay, well maybe not, but
still he wouldn't pick up.

782
01:10:43,224 --> 01:10:45,425
- Well then it doesn't matter.

783
01:10:45,427 --> 01:10:47,493
- He might be angry with me.

784
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:48,561
- Why?

785
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,601
- He went home for what we did.

786
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:00,940
He's ashamed.

787
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,581
- He could fall in
love with another boy,

788
01:11:09,818 --> 01:11:14,187
or worse, he could marry
some unsuspecting girl.

789
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:16,489
- I've been drinking.

790
01:11:16,491 --> 01:11:18,791
- That'll only help.

791
01:11:18,793 --> 01:11:21,761
- I'll call him some other time.

792
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:24,097
- No, no, tonight, we're
gonna call him tonight.

793
01:11:24,099 --> 01:11:27,100
- Chris never answered your
calls after your mission.

794
01:11:27,102 --> 01:11:29,268
- Yeah, I didn't try hard enough.
- Well, he didn't let you.

795
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:32,271
- I could've tried harder.
- Don't fuck this up like I did.

796
01:11:32,273 --> 01:11:33,606
- You didn't.

797
01:11:34,976 --> 01:11:38,044
- Come on let me see your phone.

798
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:39,846
- It's probably dead.

799
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:46,586
- You're not going
to do it, come on.

800
01:11:46,588 --> 01:11:48,655
- Just let me sort it out.

801
01:11:50,692 --> 01:11:52,558
- His roommates are
probably out right now

802
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,160
soaking with their girlfriends.

803
01:11:54,162 --> 01:11:55,628
- Gross.

804
01:11:58,133 --> 01:12:02,935
- He's alone in his dorm,
and he wants you to call him.

805
01:12:02,937 --> 01:12:04,303
- No, he doesn't.

806
01:12:07,409 --> 01:12:11,310
- You know when you think
about someone you love,

807
01:12:11,312 --> 01:12:15,181
it's usually because they're
thinking about you, too.

808
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:37,737
- Hello?

809
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:41,674
- It's Ryan.

810
01:12:44,412 --> 01:12:46,579
I'm in Portland.

811
01:12:47,549 --> 01:12:49,816
That's cool.

812
01:12:49,818 --> 01:12:52,051
How did you know I'd be up?

813
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:53,786
- Just luck, I guess.

814
01:12:54,856 --> 01:12:59,358
It's nice to hear from you.

815
01:13:00,862 --> 01:13:02,995
- It's so good to
hear your voice.

816
01:13:02,997 --> 01:13:04,530
It's weird you'd called,

817
01:13:04,532 --> 01:13:06,466
I've been thinking about you.

818
01:13:06,468 --> 01:13:07,800
- You have?

819
01:13:07,802 --> 01:13:12,171
- Yeah,
like all the flipping time.

820
01:13:17,779 --> 01:13:19,412
- Are you alone?

821
01:13:20,882 --> 01:13:23,616
Yeah, are you?

822
01:13:24,686 --> 01:13:26,385
- Yeah, I am.

823
01:13:28,123 --> 01:13:30,389
So, how have you been?

824
01:13:32,093 --> 01:13:34,961
- Good.

825
01:13:38,867 --> 01:13:41,801
I miss you.

826
01:13:42,837 --> 01:13:44,103
- I miss you, too.

827
01:13:44,973 --> 01:13:47,607
- Really?
- Yeah.

828
01:13:50,912 --> 01:13:53,379
- I wish I could see your face.

829
01:13:56,985 --> 01:13:59,519
- Well maybe we could
make that happen.

830
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:02,522
- Really?
- Yeah.

831
01:14:07,595 --> 01:14:11,464
- I remember how you
used to look at me.

832
01:14:11,466 --> 01:14:14,801
- Like you were the only
person in the world?

833
01:14:14,803 --> 01:14:16,702
- Yeah.

834
01:14:16,704 --> 01:14:19,105
- It's because that's all I saw.

835
01:14:22,544 --> 01:14:24,944
I love you.

836
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,184
- I love you, too.

837
01:14:33,121 --> 01:14:35,855
So much.

838
01:14:39,661 --> 01:14:44,330
- I'm coming home,
I think it's time.

839
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,459
- President, may I sit?

840
01:16:20,461 --> 01:16:22,941
- Yes, brother Merrill.

841
01:16:29,904 --> 01:16:33,005
Let me first say that
I am praying for you.

842
01:16:33,007 --> 01:16:35,608
I've been speaking with
our Heavenly Father,

843
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:37,310
and He loves you.

844
01:16:37,312 --> 01:16:41,213
Debbie was dear to
me and to Francis.

845
01:16:41,215 --> 01:16:43,916
How are Chelsea, and Greg,
Chris and Kaylee?

846
01:16:45,486 --> 01:16:49,555
- Well Chelsea is taking
it pretty hard, as is Greg.

847
01:16:50,658 --> 01:16:54,226
Kaylee, we tell her
that Deedee has gone on

848
01:16:54,228 --> 01:16:58,197
to her eternal family, but
you know, she's a child.

849
01:16:59,534 --> 01:17:02,168
Chris has been a rock.

850
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,770
And he's actually a
big part of the reason

851
01:17:04,772 --> 01:17:06,872
I'm here today.

852
01:17:06,874 --> 01:17:08,641
- Oh?

853
01:17:08,643 --> 01:17:12,979
- He suffered from same-sex
attraction for many years.

854
01:17:12,981 --> 01:17:17,483
I tried, I did everything
I could to help him,

855
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:20,286
but I've stopped that now.

856
01:17:20,288 --> 01:17:23,422
- It's a very difficult
situation.

857
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:27,693
- I realized that he
is fine the way he is.

858
01:17:27,695 --> 01:17:30,730
There's no need
for him to change.

859
01:17:31,499 --> 01:17:32,932
- Brother Merrill,

860
01:17:32,934 --> 01:17:36,802
you know that Lucifer will
try every trick to mislead us.

861
01:17:38,606 --> 01:17:41,273
- You continue to
teach me to be open

862
01:17:41,275 --> 01:17:45,044
to the promptings of the
spirit, and I feel my heart

863
01:17:45,046 --> 01:17:48,114
softening towards Chris
and the many faithful

864
01:17:48,116 --> 01:17:49,482
who are like him.

865
01:17:55,423 --> 01:17:57,823
Where's our spirituality?

866
01:17:57,825 --> 01:18:01,160
Where's our response
to the love of God?

867
01:18:03,331 --> 01:18:07,366
This doesn't feel like
love, making people choose...

868
01:18:08,669 --> 01:18:12,271
separating ourselves
from them for eternity.

869
01:18:16,077 --> 01:18:20,112
Have you seen what's
happening in the world?

870
01:18:20,114 --> 01:18:25,584
People are being killed,
beaten, discriminated against

871
01:18:25,586 --> 01:18:30,423
every day, my son among them.

872
01:18:30,425 --> 01:18:31,624
- I understand,

873
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:36,095
brother Merrill, but I
have heard from the Lord...

874
01:18:36,097 --> 01:18:40,199
is that we have to proceed
as we already have.

875
01:18:41,302 --> 01:18:44,303
- Well, I, too, have talked
to our Heavenly Father.

876
01:18:44,305 --> 01:18:45,853
Oh, have you?

877
01:18:45,865 --> 01:18:50,543
Yes and He told me that
we, the apostles, and...

878
01:18:52,513 --> 01:18:55,781
the Quorum must continue
to discuss this matter.

879
01:19:03,691 --> 01:19:07,093
- Alright, son, you'll
have your meeting.

880
01:19:08,362 --> 01:19:12,631
In the meantime,
Noah, get some rest.

881
01:19:12,633 --> 01:19:14,200
You're going through
much more now

882
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:15,968
than you may realize.

883
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:21,140
- Thank you, but I really
need to work right now.

884
01:19:22,543 --> 01:19:24,310
- I understand.

885
01:19:24,312 --> 01:19:25,978
Let us pray.

886
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,313
- Of course.

887
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:35,588
- Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank you for the friendships

888
01:19:37,024 --> 01:19:43,729
that support us in difficult times...
when we lose family

889
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:47,600
until we see them
again in eternal life,

890
01:19:47,602 --> 01:19:49,168
it is very hard.

891
01:19:52,673 --> 01:19:54,840
- Okay. Do you remember which
order these go in?

892
01:19:54,842 --> 01:19:55,875
- Yeah.

893
01:19:56,644 --> 01:19:59,445
- Alright, put 'em
in order for me.

894
01:20:07,455 --> 01:20:10,556
Very good, good job.

895
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:15,594
So can you tell me where
Grandma is, do you remember?

896
01:20:15,596 --> 01:20:19,131
Very good, that's the spirit world.
That's paradise.

897
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:20,933
That's where she's
waiting for all of us.

898
01:20:20,935 --> 01:20:23,269
- Here?
- Yep, right there.

899
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:26,372
- Yeah, right there,
and one day, we will all

900
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:29,208
be together right here.

901
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:32,711
So it'll be you, and me, and
Mommy's going to be there,

902
01:20:32,713 --> 01:20:36,916
and your Grandma, and we
will all be together forever.

903
01:20:36,918 --> 01:20:38,851
- RJ, too?

904
01:20:42,156 --> 01:20:45,124
- Yeah, of course,
he'll be there.

905
01:20:48,563 --> 01:20:50,963
Of course, he'll be there, baby.

906
01:20:54,535 --> 01:20:56,268
Oh, your Mommy's going to
be here in a few minutes.

907
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:58,070
Do you want to go
outside and wait for her?

908
01:20:58,072 --> 01:20:59,572
See if we can see her drive up?

909
01:20:59,574 --> 01:21:01,106
- Yeah.
- Okay.

910
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:46,252
- You promise you're not mad
that I'm not going to BYU?

911
01:21:46,254 --> 01:21:47,686
- I'm not mad.

912
01:21:48,656 --> 01:21:50,322
This makes so more sense.

913
01:21:50,324 --> 01:21:53,025
You won't have to
disrupt Kaylee's life.

914
01:21:54,262 --> 01:21:56,228
This place is beautiful.

915
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,663
- Yeah.

916
01:21:57,665 --> 01:21:59,531
It's the right thing.

917
01:22:04,405 --> 01:22:07,806
I was thinking about our
dinner with the Smiths,

918
01:22:07,808 --> 01:22:10,509
and how much I wished your
mom could have been there

919
01:22:10,511 --> 01:22:12,611
for that.

920
01:22:18,152 --> 01:22:21,487
It had a life marker
feel about it.

921
01:22:25,493 --> 01:22:30,496
It's inspired me to
bring some matters up

922
01:22:30,498 --> 01:22:32,498
before the Quorum.

923
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,834
I'm going to broach the
subject of the new policy

924
01:22:35,836 --> 01:22:39,305
and also same-sex
marriage in the Church.

925
01:22:44,111 --> 01:22:46,445
What do you think about that?

926
01:22:50,418 --> 01:22:55,220
- I don't think I ever told
you this, but... while I was

927
01:22:55,222 --> 01:23:00,826
in therapy... they told
me time and again,

928
01:23:00,828 --> 01:23:04,330
you can choose God or
you can choose love.

929
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:09,134
Well, to me, they're
one in the same.

930
01:23:09,136 --> 01:23:12,771
My own daughter knows
that, a child knows that.

931
01:23:15,976 --> 01:23:18,911
I'm not going to let
anyone tell me who I can

932
01:23:18,913 --> 01:23:23,549
and can't be with... and I'm
not going to let anyone...

933
01:23:23,551 --> 01:23:26,785
define those choices
for me either.

934
01:23:32,893 --> 01:23:37,296
This meeting with the
President, with the Quorum...

935
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:44,002
thank you, but I hope you're
not doing it just for me.

936
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,740
I hope you're doing
it because you know

937
01:23:47,742 --> 01:23:50,342
it's the right thing to do.

938
01:23:52,513 --> 01:23:56,615
- As a member of the
Quorum, I'm limited.

939
01:23:56,617 --> 01:24:00,486
I'm one voice in that
room, but I'm going to have

940
01:24:00,488 --> 01:24:02,421
your mom with me.

941
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:12,831
You know... when I saw
you and RJ together,

942
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:16,668
when he had his panic attack,
and you ran after him...

943
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:19,738
reassured him, talked
him through it.

944
01:24:21,108 --> 01:24:25,110
That reminded me so
much of your mom and I,

945
01:24:25,112 --> 01:24:27,446
and how we cared for each other.

946
01:24:28,082 --> 01:24:29,748
That's love.

947
01:24:30,584 --> 01:24:32,618
I saw that with you.

948
01:24:34,155 --> 01:24:38,824
It's like a dream...

949
01:24:38,826 --> 01:24:42,361
this life,
it only lasts so long.

950
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:50,736
I love you, son.

951
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:53,872
- I love you, too, Dad.

952
01:24:57,545 --> 01:24:59,178
- God, I miss her.

953
01:25:00,714 --> 01:25:02,114
- Me too.

954
01:26:53,093 --> 01:26:55,460
- Hey.
- Hi.

955
01:26:55,462 --> 01:26:56,995
- How long have you been here?

956
01:26:56,997 --> 01:26:59,031
- Three and a half hours.

957
01:26:59,033 --> 01:27:00,832
- I'm so sorry.

958
01:27:00,834 --> 01:27:01,900
- It's okay.

959
01:27:03,604 --> 01:27:04,903
- You got into law school.

960
01:27:04,905 --> 01:27:07,639
- I did.

961
01:27:10,344 --> 01:27:14,913
- Congratulations.
- Thank you... Oh, okay.

962
01:28:52,546 --> 01:28:56,715
- Have you had time... to think?

963
01:29:11,298 --> 01:29:13,899
You don't have to
be strong for me.

964
01:29:45,632 --> 01:29:48,100
- I never got to say goodbye.

965
01:29:50,871 --> 01:29:53,171
She was so good.

966
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:41,406
- Hi, you've reached
the voice-mail box of Christopher Merrill.

967
01:32:41,408 --> 01:32:44,943
- Chris, as a member of
the Quorum of the Twelve,

968
01:32:44,945 --> 01:32:47,913
I have to tell you that
I cannot support you,

969
01:32:47,915 --> 01:32:52,050
but as your father,
you have my blessing.

970
01:32:52,052 --> 01:32:54,886
You don't need it,
but you have it.

971
01:33:08,135 --> 01:33:10,502
- Hey, hey, you have time.

972
01:33:10,504 --> 01:33:12,170
You're not going to
miss your flight.

973
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:14,472
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

974
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:23,882
What's in going to be like
when you start school?

975
01:33:23,884 --> 01:33:26,451
- Well, you know there's
going to be breaks every now

976
01:33:26,453 --> 01:33:32,290
and then, and it's
only three years.

977
01:33:32,292 --> 01:33:35,794
- A lot can happen
in three years.

978
01:33:35,796 --> 01:33:37,829
- Yeah.

979
01:33:37,831 --> 01:33:39,097
- I just feel like
you're going to leave,

980
01:33:39,099 --> 01:33:41,566
and everything's
going to be the same.

981
01:33:41,568 --> 01:33:43,234
- RJ, I know why
you feel that way.

982
01:33:43,236 --> 01:33:45,437
- I prayed this morning.

983
01:33:48,175 --> 01:33:52,677
I prayed for Heavenly
Father to give me strength.

984
01:33:52,679 --> 01:33:56,514
I prayed for strength
to let us go,

985
01:33:57,718 --> 01:34:00,085
so that you could attend to
matters in your own life,

986
01:34:00,087 --> 01:34:02,220
and I could do the same.

987
01:34:05,058 --> 01:34:08,259
I know that the Church
has betrayed us...

988
01:34:09,563 --> 01:34:17,535
and it's excluded us, and
it's been... heart breaking...

989
01:34:17,537 --> 01:34:19,337
but when you're
wrapped up in it,

990
01:34:19,339 --> 01:34:21,172
I can't live without it.

991
01:34:29,449 --> 01:34:34,119
- I know it's been really
crazy the last couple

992
01:34:34,121 --> 01:34:37,856
of weeks, and for my part,
I apologize for that...

993
01:34:43,096 --> 01:34:44,429
but if it's taught me anything,

994
01:34:44,431 --> 01:34:47,365
it's that life is way too short.

995
01:34:48,702 --> 01:34:52,804
For the first time in my
life, I know what I want

996
01:34:52,806 --> 01:34:54,305
and who I want.

997
01:34:56,376 --> 01:34:57,776
I want you.

998
01:35:01,048 --> 01:35:06,418
And Kaylee, and the Church,
I want it all...

999
01:35:07,554 --> 01:35:09,421
because we deserve it.

1000
01:35:10,157 --> 01:35:11,790
- I want it all, too.

1001
01:35:11,792 --> 01:35:14,159
I want everything.

1002
01:35:14,161 --> 01:35:18,029
It belongs to us as much as
it belongs to anyone else...

1003
01:35:19,633 --> 01:35:24,169
and nobody can tell us
what our options are...

1004
01:35:24,171 --> 01:35:26,471
and I don't want to
fuck around anymore.

1005
01:35:33,547 --> 01:35:39,017
- Well, I had this whole
other thing planned.

1006
01:35:47,294 --> 01:35:50,728
I called your dad recently...

1007
01:35:52,899 --> 01:35:58,069
and the reason I called him was to
ask his permission to marry his son.

1008
01:36:23,096 --> 01:36:24,762
Will you marry me?

1009
01:36:28,668 --> 01:36:32,971
Yes...

1010
01:36:32,973 --> 01:36:35,006
I love you.

1011
01:36:36,109 --> 01:36:37,876
- I love you so much.

1012
01:36:46,386 --> 01:36:49,187
I will never leave you again.

1013
01:37:02,836 --> 01:37:05,470
You need some tissue?

1014
01:37:05,472 --> 01:37:06,971
- No, no I'm okay.

1015
01:37:08,909 --> 01:37:11,409
- I have a plane to catch.

1016
01:37:11,411 --> 01:37:13,912
- You said you would never leave.
- Just this once.

1017
01:37:13,914 --> 01:37:15,747
- Okay.
- Okay.

1018
01:37:24,157 --> 01:37:27,192
- Our dear Heavenly Father,
we're so very grateful

1019
01:37:27,194 --> 01:37:31,829
for this blessed day, to be
here, with these two young men.

1020
01:37:31,831 --> 01:37:34,532
We pray that thy
spirit will be with us,

1021
01:37:34,534 --> 01:37:37,402
and it will bless them
and strengthen them

1022
01:37:37,404 --> 01:37:39,938
as they endure life's
challenges together.

1023
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:42,507
We pray that all will be
enriched by this experience

1024
01:37:42,509 --> 01:37:43,975
as we leave today,

1025
01:37:43,977 --> 01:37:47,212
and that we will always
remember to treat thy children

1026
01:37:47,214 --> 01:37:51,482
with the utmost of love,
kindness, and patience,

1027
01:37:51,484 --> 01:37:54,085
and we ask these things
humbly in the name of thy Son,

1028
01:37:54,087 --> 01:37:55,987
Jesus Christ, Amen.

1029
01:37:55,989 --> 01:37:57,622
- Amen.

1030
01:38:01,895 --> 01:38:03,595
- And now the rings.

1031
01:38:23,717 --> 01:38:27,352
Brethren, do you take
one another by the hand

1032
01:38:28,822 --> 01:38:32,523
and receive each other to
be your lawful and wedded

1033
01:38:32,525 --> 01:38:35,660
husband for time
and all eternity,

1034
01:38:38,131 --> 01:38:41,399
and this you do in the
presence of God, angels,

1035
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:47,972
and these witnesses of your
own free will and choice?

1036
01:38:47,974 --> 01:38:49,641
- Yes.

1037
01:38:50,143 --> 01:38:51,509
- Yes.

1038
01:38:52,712 --> 01:38:57,015
- By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husbands.

1039
01:39:28,214 --> 01:39:35,953
- My name is RJ Smith, and I
married Chris, the love of my life...

1040
01:39:35,955 --> 01:39:39,724
in December of 2016,
in Portland, Oregon,

1041
01:39:42,529 --> 01:39:45,129
our families were both there,

1042
01:39:45,131 --> 01:39:47,832
including my stepdaughter
Kaylee.

1043
01:39:50,637 --> 01:39:53,438
I soon moved to
Salt Lake with them.

1044
01:39:55,342 --> 01:39:57,442
I got a job as an
adjunct professor

1045
01:39:57,444 --> 01:40:04,148
at the University of Utah,
and I finished my new book.

1046
01:40:06,853 --> 01:40:11,222
I finally found a way to join the
two opposing sides of myself.

1047
01:40:15,862 --> 01:40:21,566
My first day in our home,
we knelt down and prayed.

1048
01:40:25,238 --> 01:40:30,108
Chris said to me softly,
"This is it."

1049
01:40:32,879 --> 01:40:34,645
This is what we have.

1050
01:40:37,817 --> 01:40:41,052
"This is what we've
been fighting for."

1051
01:40:42,255 --> 01:40:47,492
He said it was all worth it...
and he was right.
