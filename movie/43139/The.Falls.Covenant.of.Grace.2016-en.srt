1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,470
(glass breaking)

2
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:38,637
(slow elegant classical music)

3
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,424
- [Narrator] I still don't
know where we fit in the world.

4
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,931
I thought leaving faith
behind would relieve

5
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,367
the dissonance I always felt.

6
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:12,472
It didn't.

7
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,980
Through it all, I find myself
holding onto these values.

8
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,852
So does Chris, my former
mission companion.

9
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,789
For one reason or
another, we've had trouble

10
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,158
finding our way.

11
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,765
It's been a year
since I've seen him,

12
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,535
and tomorrow, he comes
back to the Northwest.

13
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,807
We've agreed to put it all
behind us and start fresh,

14
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:53,879
uninhibited by the Church,
our families, distance,

15
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,347
or anything else.

16
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,183
We deserve that.

17
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,720
Everyone does.

18
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,225
(uplifting piano rock music)

19
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,526
* Don't you wanna fall *

20
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,128
* Don't you wanna fly *

21
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,265
* Don't you wanna be
dangled over the edge *

22
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:18,570
* Of this aching romance *

23
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,380
(cell phone ringing)

24
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:34,988
- Hey.
- Hey.

25
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,423
I cannot believe you're
going to be here tomorrow.

26
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,992
- I know.

27
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,928
- I can introduce you to
all my friends finally.

28
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,731
- I can introduce
you to my friend.

29
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,733
- Hi.

30
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,937
- Hi, Kaylee.
- Hi.

31
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,138
- How are you?

32
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,439
- Good.

33
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,209
- You are so cute, I
can't even stand it.

34
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,011
- It's past her bedtime.

35
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,145
Do you want to say goodnight?

36
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,848
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Kaylee.

37
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,684
- All right, wanna take Gillian,
and go brush all your guys' teeth.

38
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,985
[sneeze]
God bless you.

39
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,520
- Gesundheit.

40
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,456
- I'll be in tuck you
in just a sec, okay.

41
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,759
(giggling)

42
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,863
- I'm so excited to see you.

43
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,233
- I know, it'll be
good to see you, too.

44
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,904
I better hit the hay as well.

45
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,640
- Yeah, um...

46
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,950
Uh... so I know that
we discussed this,

47
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,785
and I know that you're
trying to figure it all out,

48
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,921
but I just want to say that...

49
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,790
you know,
she's more than welcome

50
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,826
to come up with you
next time you come up,

51
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,361
if that's okay.

52
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,299
- Yeah, no, I'll
think about that.

53
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,335
- Okay, great.

54
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:00,138
- Well, goodnight,
I'll see you soon.

55
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,640
- Yeah, goodnight.

56
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,181
I love you, I love you, Chris.

57
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,251
Just... I love you.

58
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,289
Why can't I just say that
like a normal person?

59
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,225
- RJ?

60
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,494
- Okay, yeah, hi.

61
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,597
- Hi, no, I'm still here, did
you want me to hang up?

62
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,467
- Well, sure that'd be...
- Or I can.

63
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,202
Not that I want
to hang up on you.

64
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,371
- No, I know.
- Okay.

65
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:36,008
- Alright, goodnight.
- Yep, goodnight.

66
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,442
- Bye.

67
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,878
(groans)

68
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,120
* Ride the big one *

69
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,322
* Don't you wanna fall *

70
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,190
* Don't you wanna fly *

71
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:56,461
* Don't you wanna be
dangled over the edge *

72
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:02,067
* Of this aching romance *

73
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,904
* If it's going to
end then I wanna know *

74
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,408
* Let me squeeze
out every moment *

75
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,276
* But if there's nothing left *

76
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,345
* Can you tell me why *

77
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:18,383
* That it is you're
holding onto me *

78
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:24,823
* Like it's the end
of the world *

79
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,894
(traffic rushing by)

80
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,429
Hey.

81
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,236
- Thanks for coming to get me.

82
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,505
- You look good.

83
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,008
- Thank you.
- I think I lost a little weight.

84
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,543
- It looks good.

85
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,911
- Thanks.

86
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,752
(clearing throats)

87
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,893
(blinker ticking)

88
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,498
I'm really happy you're here.

89
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,936
I didn't think you'd ever
speak to me again after the...

90
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:14,072
- I said I forgive you,
and I meant it.

91
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,441
I just think people were
legitimately confused

92
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,977
why two men were kissing at
my parents' anniversary party.

93
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,078
- I was trying to
make a statement.

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,481
- Well, mission accomplished.

95
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,019
- You know I'm excited for
you to meet Adina and Sheris.

96
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,721
- Yeah, they sound great.

97
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,356
- Any my friend Ryan.

98
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,125
- Oh he is the
returning missionary

99
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,726
you were telling me about?

100
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,131
Great.

101
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,887
- Yeah, I'll be there.

102
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,857
Okay, give her my love, please.

103
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,895
Alright, thank you.

104
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,696
Okay, bye.

105
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,200
Sometimes it feels
like I'm still married.

106
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,538
Thanks.

107
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,318
- You hungry?

108
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,387
- I could eat.

109
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:44,329
(slow, warm piano music)

110
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,287
- Am I that hard to be around?

111
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,726
- No.

112
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,293
- So how is life after
pharmaceutical sales?

113
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,330
- Well, I haven't heard
back from any of the schools

114
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,598
that I've applied to.

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,033
I've got my heart set on
sticking close to home.

116
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,872
What about you, how's work?

117
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,573
- Work's going well.

118
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:33,645
I haven't written anything
original in a while.

119
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,659
- I forgot to tell
you my sister read

120
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,394
one of your books.

121
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,762
- Oh, which one?

122
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,365
- The really dirty one.

123
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,867
- Yeah, tell her I'm sorry.

124
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,069
- It's just that she knew
you were talking about me,

125
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,504
and it was like...

126
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,072
- I know that's why
I'm apologizing.

127
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,341
How is Chelsea?

128
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,645
- She's good, it's Greg
that I don't talk to,

129
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,414
but you already knew that.

130
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,850
- Do they know that you're
here with me right now?

131
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,785
- My Mom does.

132
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:17,389
My Dad, he's...

133
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,527
- Let's loosen up.

134
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,762
- Okay.

135
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,938
- No, I don't drink.

136
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,974
- Come on, you have
no where else to be.

137
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,810
(glasses clinking)

138
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,316
How often do I get to see you?

139
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,153
- Alright, I'll do one.

140
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,264
(groaning)

141
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,904
- Another one?

142
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,907
- You know you can't get me drunk.
- I just got here.

143
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,710
- I'm not trying to get you
drunk, it's just happening.

144
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,780
(glasses clink)

145
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:52,584
- Why does it take us so
long to get comfortable?

146
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:53,918
- I don't know.

147
00:10:54,955 --> 00:11:00,692
I feel like I still get...
nervous around you.

148
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,327
- Yeah, I get nervous, too.

149
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,895
- After all this time.

150
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:08,233
- Yeah, we're just
two fluttering hearts.

151
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:24,149
(breathing heavily)

152
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,865
(breathing heavily together)

153
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,843
(moaning)

154
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,448
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

155
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,624
- [Chris] You know,
I think I can do

156
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,393
this whole Northwest thing.

157
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,197
- [RJ] What? You are doing it.

158
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,398
- [Chris] What?

159
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,601
- You're hanging out
with gay, bearded men,

160
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,069
and you're drinking beer.

161
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,207
- And what about the
Salt Lake City thing?

162
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,541
- What about it?

163
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,745
- Could you do it?

164
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,547
- I think you
could barely do it.

165
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,551
- Well, maybe you won't have to.

166
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,960
- Okay.

167
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,595
- Where are you going?

168
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,064
- I am headed back to your
house to get some more beer.

169
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,132
- I thought you said
you weren't drinking.

170
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,668
- You, sir, have
opened the flood gates.

171
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,670
I'm past the point of no return.

172
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,773
- You can't just say
that and then walk away.

173
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,274
- Too late.

174
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,542
- Come on, ugh.

175
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,480
(lighter clicks)

176
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,749
(giggling)

177
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,888
You'll be okay.

178
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,060
- I think it's...
- It's a little dry.

179
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,264
We'll be okay.

180
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,299
- I'm good.

181
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,044
- Hey did you...
- sleep with anybody else

182
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,813
since I saw you last?

183
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,783
- I had sex with
Paul after Salt Lake.

184
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,285
- I knew about that.

185
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,854
I saw you after that.

186
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,857
- Yeah, I just didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

187
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,859
- Don't worry about it.

188
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,832
Was there anybody else?

189
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:59,404
- Um, like a night here, and a
night there, but nothing real.

190
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,646
- Yeah, I had to break a
couple bad habits myself.

191
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,448
- What makes them bad?

192
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,953
- Just, oing places, and...

193
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,060
meeting people.

194
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,272
What do you think about that?

195
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,344
- I think that we shouldn't
feel like we're bad people

196
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,745
all the time.

197
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,817
It's okay to have sex, you
know, we're supposed to cum.

198
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,186
We're supposed to cum.

199
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,090
We are animals, it's okay.

200
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,426
We're okay.

201
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:01,199
- You're not, you're
not going to judge me?

202
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,600
- No.

203
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,871
- I just wanted to get
it all out in the open.

204
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,741
- Yeah, it's fine.

205
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,713
We can get everything
out in the open.

206
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:21,286
Every last thing we can
get out in the open.

207
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:30,161
Three, two... one.

208
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,472
(kissing and breathing heavily)

209
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,058
(laughing and kissing)

210
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,177
(sleepy harp music)

211
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,462
(yawning)

212
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,631
- Hey.

213
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,072
Good morning.

214
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,745
Do you want some coffee?

215
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,513
- I am a Mormon, sir.

216
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,783
- So now you're a Mormon?

217
00:16:58,785 --> 00:16:59,785
- Amen.

218
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:09,560
- Get up, get up.

219
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,696
(groaning)

220
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,731
Get up.

221
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,705
- Oh.

222
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,939
- What?

223
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,041
- My breath.

224
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,510
- I don't mind, come on.

225
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,145
- I do.

226
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:30,314
- Come on, go.

227
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,356
(laughing)

228
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,526
I wasn't ready for that.

229
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,761
- Then why did you
tell me to do it?

230
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,898
- I'm just kidding.

231
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,107
I'll go make us some breakfast.

232
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,133
Hey, how do you want
your eggs cooked?

233
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,778
- Everything's so bright.

234
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,848
- It's called day.

235
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,786
- Thank you for breakfast.

236
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,221
- You're welcome.

237
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,694
- Where does your
head hurt, there?

238
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,362
- Right here. Oh.

239
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,631
(groaning)

240
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,770
- Well, you gotta
drink more water.

241
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,272
Keep going.

242
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:08,246
Here, I'm going to
get you some more.

243
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,281
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,108
(phone clatters on counter)

245
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,695
- "New IDS guidelines say
children of same-sex couples...

246
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,698
will not be baptized
in the Church."

247
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,708
I know you want to discuss this,

248
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,109
but if you'll just
give me a moment

249
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,191
- to read the whole article.
- They're joking, right?

250
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:23,054
It says they're doing this
for their own protection,

251
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,823
that children from gay
marriages can't be treated

252
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,458
like everyone else.

253
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:34,098
Punishing children for
the sins of their own fathers.

254
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,701
We don't even believe in that.

255
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,406
You can interpret
this any way you want,

256
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,641
but I am done.

257
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,445
- I don't think you mean that.

258
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,451
(knocking on the door)

259
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,752
- That's Adina.

260
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,889
- Hello, hi!

261
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,925
- Hi.
- Hi!

262
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:05,429
I'm Adina, I've heard
so much about you.

263
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,697
- I'm Chris.

264
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,633
- Yeah, I know.

265
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,235
- Nice to meet you.

266
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,372
- Yeah, what's this?

267
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,439
- What?

268
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,575
- The love of your
life is finally here,

269
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,010
and you make him this?

270
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,045
- Well, it's all I had.

271
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,187
- Where's Sheris?

272
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,922
- Not sure.

273
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,691
- Is everything okay?

274
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:37,061
- No, but I'll be fine.

275
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,531
(laughing)

276
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,802
Come on.

277
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,270
- What?

278
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,039
- I'm a lip kisser, come on.

279
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,273
- Oh?

280
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:55,413
- What, you were married
to a woman once, you'll be fine.

281
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,020
- He has soft lips.

282
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:06,223
(murmuring agreement)

283
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:12,963
(laughing)
- Back and forth?

284
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,332
[Chris] Back and forth?

285
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,033
- Yeah, you know it's like...
- (making swishing sound).

286
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,234
- No, that's up and down.

287
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:18,436
- Together.

288
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,037
- I assume that people
poop up and down.

289
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,406
- Okay, moving on,
having anuses for eyes.

290
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,942
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

291
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,745
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

292
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,313
- Hey. Ryan.
- Chris.

293
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,248
- Oh, it's great to
finally meet you.

294
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,383
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

295
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:33,651
- Hey.

296
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,186
- Ryan.
- Anya.

297
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,987
- Steve. Nice to meet you.

298
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,856
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

299
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,259
- Oh, you guys
started without me?

300
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,728
- [Steve] Yeah, we had
some really great ones,

301
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,774
but you can still deal
yourself in though.

302
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:45,396
But you gotta catch up.

303
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,498
- Yeah take seven and pick two.

304
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,201
- Chris, how long
are you in town for?

305
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,602
- Oh just through tomorrow.

306
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,337
- You have work or?

307
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,705
- I have a
six-year-old daughter.

308
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,607
- Oh!
- Really?

309
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,176
- And what do you do Ryan?

310
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,444
- Oh, I'm a masseur.

311
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,813
- How long have you
been doing that?

312
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,783
- Oh, I actually just graduated,
so I'm just starting out.

313
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:08,919
Actually RJ is my only client.

314
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,221
- You're only client?

315
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,756
- Yeah, I'm hoping
it'll take off.

316
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,725
It's mostly word of mouth,
but he's giving me lots

317
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,327
of practice.

318
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,598
We all know how
tense he gets, right.

319
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,601
- Wow, maybe like a
website or business cards.

320
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:26,904
- Yeah, you know, I gotta
handle that side as well.

321
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,907
I'm feeling it out, literally.

322
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,876
(laughing)

323
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,911
- Good card.
- It's so accurate, too.

324
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,813
- Your turn.
- Oh, sure, okay.

325
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,082
- Lifetime presents, A
Sad Handjob: The Story

326
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,951
of a Homoerotic
Volleyball Montage.

327
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,154
- I'd watch that.

328
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:46,690
(laughing and coughing)

329
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,794
- I can't believe I'm
smoking pot with you, Chris.

330
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,829
Your dad's a member
of the Quorum.

331
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,431
- Yes he is.

332
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,866
- Yeah, that's a tough
one for us right now.

333
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:00,137
- Yeah, I heard...
- but to be expected.

334
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,075
- So where did you serve
your mission, Ryan?

335
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:08,179
- I spent my mission
in Mexico City

336
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,681
(speaking foreign language)

337
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:15,519
It was beautiful...
and so was my companion.

338
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,126
For a year straight...

339
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,831
he would always change
in front of me...

340
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,135
totally innocent,
but he knew what he was doing.

341
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,973
And then one night,
we were on a bus

342
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:40,411
heading back to our district, and
I fell asleep on his shoulder.

343
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,781
While I was sleeping,
he had taken my hand,

344
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:47,084
and he was holding it
in a patriarchal grip.

345
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:51,522
I woke up... like this...

346
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:54,692
and I looked up
into his eyes, and...

347
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:59,730
I saw a lust and love
and longing...

348
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:07,571
but I also saw
this deep sadness...

349
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,877
because we both knew

350
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:16,914
we could never be together...

351
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:22,019
and it would just be this moment
in the back of a bus.

352
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,791
We got sent home shortly after.

353
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,695
I haven't seen him since.

354
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,609
But seeing you guys
together after so long...

355
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,077
it gives me hope.

356
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,749
I'm going to go.

357
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,018
- Really?

358
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,188
- Yeah...
- It was nice to meet you.

359
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,557
- Yeah, you too.

360
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,859
- Are you okay?

361
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,594
- Not really.

362
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,996
- Hey, hey, hey...

363
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,171
Love you.

364
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,507
- Love you, too.

365
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,752
- Where did you guys meet?

366
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,621
- Um, we met at Affirmations.

367
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,615
It's like a support group
for recovering Mormons.

368
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,715
- Yeah, I know what it is.

369
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,329
- Yeah, his parents kicked
him out of the house.

370
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,763
- Wow.

371
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,334
- I don't know,
I feel bad for him.

372
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,137
He's out here without
no family or friends.

373
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,407
- Wow.

374
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,278
- You okay?

375
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,680
- Yeah.

376
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,352
- [RJ] You coming?

377
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:02,419
- Yeah.

378
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,261
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

379
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:16,834
(yawning and breathing heavily)

380
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,611
- Have you and Ryan ever...?

381
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,216
- No.

382
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,360
- He sure loves you.

383
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,770
- Do you love me?

384
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,009
(breathing heavy)

385
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,921
(breathing grows rhythmic)

386
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,882
(moaning and breathing heavily)

387
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:24,027
(moaning grows
louder and deeper)

388
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:43,080
(exhausted breathing)

389
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:09,606
(water rushing)

390
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,795
(birds chirping)

391
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,370
- Do you want some water?

392
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,839
What are those?

393
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,042
- Oh, I have pressure
points in my back.

394
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,844
- What's wrong with your back?

395
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,148
- Just all those years of
carrying around a heavy suitcase.

396
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,986
- Thank you.

397
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,287
- Yeah.

398
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,098
- Whoa, it got chilly.

399
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,678
(water trickling)

400
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,181
Can I ask you something?

401
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,215
- Sure.

402
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,786
- Would you consider going to
a sacrament meeting with me?

403
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:36,593
- Chris, I just don't
know what the point is.

404
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,328
- I don't think it's
coincidence that you live

405
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,664
only a few blocks
away from the war.

406
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,367
It's not too late to come back.

407
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,235
- Where do you think I've gone?

408
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,372
- Not far, unless all of that
stuff in your living room

409
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,740
is just for show.

410
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,942
- I'm still trying to figure
out what they're trying

411
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,411
to say with this announcement.

412
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:01,518
By the way...
did you know?

413
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
- What?

414
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,822
- About the policy, did
you know before they made

415
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,157
the announcement?

416
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,860
- No... You honestly think
that I knew about that.

417
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:14,698
- I don't know, I just... I don't
know, I thought that if you did,

418
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,701
maybe there was something
you could've done about it.

419
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,803
- I don't know.
- Like what?

420
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,439
- Talk to your father.

421
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,309
- What possible
good would that do?

422
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,683
- I don't know, he's
like an inside voice.

423
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:35,719
One of the twelve
apostles has a gay son.

424
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,054
I mean if that's not a prophecy,

425
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:41,058
then I don't know what is.

426
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,597
Do you ever think about it?

427
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,368
What it would be like?

428
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,336
- What?

429
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,838
- I think about it
all the time...

430
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,675
with you, getting married...

431
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:06,984
in the Church with
the Sealer above us,

432
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,453
my parents and your parents.

433
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:17,594
I do... but it's not
going to happen.

434
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,097
Not like that.

435
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,434
You know what the Church does?

436
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:27,104
They convince me more and
more that maybe Joseph Smith

437
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,939
really did make it all up.

438
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,540
- Don't do that.

439
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,609
- How can you be a part of
something that alienates

440
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,679
parents from their children?

441
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,215
Don't you understand
what this means for you?

442
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,283
- I've stuck with the
Church through all of its

443
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,886
flaws and idiosyncrasies,
just like I've stuck with you

444
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,755
through all of these years.

445
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,723
- What are you talking about?

446
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,825
I'm done with it,
I've had my fill.

447
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,328
- No, you gave up,
that's different.

448
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,130
- And you don't have
the courage to leave.

449
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,865
- I don't want to leave.

450
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,235
- How are you okay with
the way the treat you,

451
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:01,571
or the way they treat your
family or your daughter?

452
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,407
As a father, how
do you accept that?

453
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,842
- Everything I do is for her.

454
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,112
You can question my beliefs
as a man of the faith,

455
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:12,549
but don't you ever question
my devotion to my daughter.

456
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,950
- I'm sorry.

457
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,456
I'm sorry.

458
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,861
- What am I doing here?

459
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,498
What am I doing?

460
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,738
I just feel obligated
to you, you know.

461
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,941
I just keep coming
back and coming back

462
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,377
because it's all that I know.

463
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,612
- Wow.

464
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,518
(wind blowing)

465
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,362
- Ricky?

466
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,865
(labored breathing)

467
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:05,836
- Hey... are you alright?

468
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:07,237
Hey.

469
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,939
What's wrong?

470
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:10,841
Are you alright?

471
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,743
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy,

472
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,212
Okay.
(panting)

473
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:21,051
What's wrong? Hey, look at me...
I'm right here.

474
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:26,823
Breathe... Are you alright?

475
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,959
- I get these sometimes.

476
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:33,964
- Hey, hey... Alright,

477
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,933
Alright.

478
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:45,375
(somber piano music)

479
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,238
Back to real life.

480
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,575
- This is real life.

481
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:26,183
I'm sorry we keep
fucking things up.

482
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,585
- You don't have to be sorry.

483
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,032
- Okay.

484
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:09,392
(slow, melancholy rock music)

485
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:48,531
(moves into
uplifting rock music)

486
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,793
(music fades)

487
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:52,128
(paper tearing, crumpling)

488
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,267
- Thanks.

489
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,281
(computer jingles)

490
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,517
(phone ringing)

491
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,592
- Call Chris.

492
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,930
- [automated voice] Say the list
number of the one you...

493
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,099
Calling the mobile
number for Chris.

494
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,968
(cheerful chiming)

495
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:10,240
(phone ringing)

496
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,714
- [Chris] Hello.

497
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:22,886
- Chris, Chris, I just heard.

498
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,954
I'm so sorry.

499
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,257
Is there anything I can I do?

500
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,284
[Chris] Would you consider
coming to Salt Lake?

501
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,296
Yeah.

502
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,633
- I can make
all the arrangements.

503
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:38,935
- No, don't worry about it.
- I'll get there.

504
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,906
- [Chris] The
service is tomorrow.

505
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,174
- Yeah, that's fine.

506
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:48,244
- [Chris] Okay,
I'll send you all the details.

507
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,712
I'll see you soon.

508
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,314
- Are you okay?

509
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,989
- [Chris] It'll just be
good to have you here.

510
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,425
- Yeah, I want to
be there with you.

511
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,428
- [Chris] I'll see you soon, RJ.

512
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,298
- Okay, I love you.

513
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,035
(phone beeps)

514
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:18,141
- [Man on the phone] Elder Merrill's
gonna pitch a fit when he sees you.

515
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,544
I think I'd like
to be there with you.

516
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,580
- [RJ] Uh...

517
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,150
- I just-I think I should
do it alone.

518
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:33,056
- [Tom] Look, son,
I never told you this, but...

519
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,494
I had a conversation with him.

520
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,928
- Wait, when?

521
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:44,667
- [Tom] We talked when you were
in Salt Lake City with Chris.

522
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:49,272
I was a bit direct.

523
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,075
- How so?

524
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,744
- [Tom] Doesn't matter now.

525
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,146
Back then I had my reasons.

526
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,919
- Um... okay.

527
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,689
What does Mom think?

528
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:10,426
- [Tom] She backs me up on this.

529
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,762
- What about your foot?

530
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,064
- [Tom] It'll be fine, RJ.

531
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,335
- Okay.

532
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:23,540
- Alright, son, I'll see you
in the morning in Salt Lake.

533
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,341
- Yeah, I'll see
you in the morning.

534
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,143
- [Tom] Alright, bye.
- Bye.

535
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,651
- Where are you headed today?

536
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:35,718
- Uh, Utah.

537
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,488
- Will you be checking
any bags today?

538
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,856
- No thanks.

539
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:42,992
- There you go, sir,
have a good flight.

540
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,494
- Thank you.

541
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:52,368
(melancholy music)

542
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,617
- Hi, thank you.

543
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:16,853
(indistinct conversation)

544
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,260
Hey.

545
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,568
Hi.
Thank you for coming.

546
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,304
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

547
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:40,777
(bright harp music)

548
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,353
- Hi, Kaylee.

549
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,721
- Hi.

550
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:52,989
- You look really pretty.

551
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,691
- Thank you.
- I like your shoes.

552
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,159
- Thank you.

553
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:57,627
- She gets a little shy.

554
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:58,995
- It's okay.

555
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,405
- I'm glad you're here.

556
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,773
- Me too.

557
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:16,979
- Hey, shall I take
her for a little why?

558
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:19,671
Yeah absolutely, you wanna
go with Grandma, honey?

559
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:20,583
Yeah.

560
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,985
I'll see you later, sweetie.

561
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:24,387
(clearing throat)

562
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:28,791
(breathing audibly)

563
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,295
You look good.

564
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,330
- You too.
- Thanks.

565
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,201
- I'm sorry.
- It's a very tough situation.

566
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:41,270
- It's challenging, yeah.
- Yeah.

567
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,239
- Are you okay?

568
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,908
- Yeah, he's walking over here.

569
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:50,580
- It's gonna be fine.
- I'm right here.

570
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,749
- I think they're
starting to recognize me.

571
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,450
- They probably are.

572
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,254
Hey, just don't kiss me.

573
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,825
Sorry, that wasn't funny.

574
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:12,552
- RJ.

575
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:15,471
- Elder Merrill, I want you to
know I'm very sorry for your loss.

576
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,206
- I appreciate that.

577
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,443
Chris didn't tell me
that you were coming.

578
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,178
- I invited him, Dad.

579
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,382
- Elder Merrill,
I'm Tom Smith, RJ's father.

580
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,950
- Oh, right.

581
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,055
- I can't begin to know what
you're going through right now.

582
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:37,360
Saying sorry isn't enough
to express my sympathies.

583
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:42,398
- Thank you, Brother Smith.

584
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,434
- And you must be Chris, brother Smith.
- Yes.

585
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:50,907
I've heard so many
great things about you.

586
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:53,609
Welcome.

587
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,511
What happened?

588
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,180
- Oh, an accident at work.

589
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,918
- Elder Smith,
I thought that was you.

590
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,487
How are you?

591
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,529
- [Tom] RJ, are you okay, son?

592
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,131
- I'm sorry.

593
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,899
- RJ?

594
00:47:19,938 --> 00:47:21,704
- Excuse me.

595
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:26,876
(labored breathing)

596
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,582
Easy, hey, easy.

597
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,185
- I'm so sorry.

598
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,187
- It's okay.

599
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:39,522
- That was so weird.
- Yeah.

600
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,893
- Our mission president...

601
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:47,263
and the look that your father
gave me, he hates me.

602
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:50,266
- Okay. Okay.
- He doesn't hate you.

603
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,134
- I just wanted to
be here for you.

604
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:55,972
- You are, you're here.

605
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,007
Rest.

606
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:01,978
Easy, easy, easy.

607
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:07,283
There we go, there
we go, there we go.

608
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,124
- They're gonna be alright.

609
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,693
- Yeah, why don't you
and RJ stick around,

610
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:19,795
and we'll get some dinner?

611
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:23,099
- Oh, Elder Merrill, I couldn't
intrude on your mourning.

612
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,166
- We need to have a talk.

613
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,602
We need to have a
candid conversation,

614
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,337
and I would like you and RJ

615
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,540
to join us for dinner tonight,
alright?

616
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:32,742
- Absolutely.

617
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,243
- Good, thank you.

618
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:00,569
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

619
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,179
So, I hear you're
going to law school.

620
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,714
- I'm still applying.

621
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:13,182
- I bet your mother was proud.

622
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,617
- Yeah, she was.

623
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,822
As far as she was concerned,
I was already practicing law.

624
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:22,892
- My old mission companion
became an attorney.

625
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:26,796
I saw him and some of my
other companions recently.

626
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:32,234
We met up for a night, and
life didn't skip a beat,

627
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:34,270
let me tell you.

628
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:37,073
We picked up right
where we left off.

629
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,309
We shared our blessings,
and our tragedies,

630
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:44,180
love and heartbreak.

631
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:51,220
Some of them... I had no idea
what they were going through

632
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,822
back then.

633
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,195
It's nice to have
people in your life

634
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,097
you can depend on.

635
00:50:03,935 --> 00:50:06,836
- I'm Greg, Chris's brother.

636
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:09,372
- Thomas Smith, RJ's father.

637
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,773
- It's good to see you again.

638
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,274
- Thank you.

639
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:22,451
Did you know my mother?

640
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:25,755
- Okay, Greg, I know that
you don't care much for me,

641
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,456
so maybe we should...

642
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:31,560
- I would like to sit
here and mourn my mother

643
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:34,730
without the shadow
of my brother's past

644
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,266
looming over this sacred moment.

645
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,004
- I'm sorry.
- May I have that?

646
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,173
- You're really going to
do this right now, Greg?

647
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:48,077
- Our father asked me to
be here, and here I am.

648
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:52,214
Dad.

649
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:56,986
- Boys, Brother Smith, RJ.

650
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:58,454
- Elder Merrill.

651
00:50:58,456 --> 00:50:59,955
- Good to see you.

652
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,731
- I didn't know what to get, so I
got a variety of foods, pad Thai.

653
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,800
- I hope Thai is
good for everyone.

654
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:14,537
We didn't have much left
after the reception, so...

655
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:17,706
Looks good, nice and hot.

656
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,875
Brother Smith, would
you like to pray for us?

657
00:51:19,877 --> 00:51:23,212
- Elder Merrill, I'd
be honored if a member

658
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,381
of the Quorum would
say a blessing.

659
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:29,185
- Okay, call me Noah, alright?

660
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,253
- Let's pray.

661
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,693
Our Heavenly Father,
thank you for bringing

662
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:41,530
Tom and RJ safely to us
today and as our families

663
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,966
come together, please help
us guide our conversation,

664
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:47,870
help us discover what
is best for everyone,

665
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,005
in the name of
Jesus Christ, Amen.

666
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,540
- [Together] Amen.

667
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:09,892
- Brother Smith and RJ,
thank you both

668
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:14,230
for being here today, it was
very gracious of you to come.

669
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:22,505
I have to make clear right
now and bear testimony

670
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:25,374
to each of you that...

671
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,478
sexual relations

672
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,349
between two of the
same sex is wrong.

673
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:37,319
By doing so, our children
become apostates,

674
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,990
and should be culled
from the kingdom.

675
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:44,393
Now the rest of the world may
be taking a different path,

676
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:48,097
but we remain faithful
to the Gospel.

677
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:50,966
- You've made some pretty
bold assumptions, Dad.

678
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:53,602
- I've seen it with
my own eyes, Chris.

679
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,037
I've read his book.

680
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,806
- There's a book?

681
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:01,243
- It's a detailed account
of their mission together.

682
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,013
And you, how do you feel
about this, having your

683
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,882
adventures out there in
print for everyone to see?

684
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,617
- I wouldn't want them in print.

685
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:11,554
- Well, no one would read
a book about you, Greg.

686
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,390
- Did you read the whole thing?

687
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:17,459
- I read as much as I could.

688
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,495
- What about the part when
they helped the veteran

689
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:24,366
with PTSD make his peace with
heavenly Father and himself.

690
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,035
Did you read that?

691
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,539
- Your son and I fell in love.

692
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:36,345
We did things that people do
when they love each other.

693
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:41,016
- Faith isn't a Kinsey scale.

694
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:42,918
You're either a man of faith,
or you're not.

695
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,189
- Elder Merrill, I can assure you, RJ...
- Dad.

696
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,658
Like it or not,
I'm in your life.

697
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:56,198
A man of God or not, I feel the
loss of this woman tonight,

698
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,267
and I feel it through him.

699
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:04,039
And he's a man that I love
and whose family I love.

700
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:13,015
- My mother would've loved you.

701
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:16,285
Just like I do.

702
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:32,268
- So what's this
going to look like?

703
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,570
- What's what
going to look like?

704
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:35,938
- This.

705
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:37,773
- What?

706
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,409
You two, with him in Seattle?

707
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:42,611
- Well, RJ moved
to Portland, Dad.

708
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,680
- Well, that's the same thing.

709
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:46,148
Kaylee's in Salt Lake City.

710
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,755
- RJ and I aren't
together right now.

711
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,625
- Wait a minute, I thought
that you guys were...

712
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:58,862
ya know.

713
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,565
- Yeah why not? I just heard
you say that you love him.

714
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:20,449
Do you mind if I ask
what the problem is?

715
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:30,025
- The Church... and where
we fit inside of it all.

716
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:31,360
We don't know.

717
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,533
- I see.

718
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,837
(somber piano music)

719
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:49,778
- Thanks.
- (speaks indistinctly)

720
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,715
RJ, thank you for
being here for Chris.

721
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,483
- Mm-hmm.

722
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,664
- Thank you for coming.

723
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,110
(speaking indistinctly)

724
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:38,761
- Son, give me a hand.
- Thanks.

725
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:49,905
You know, RJ, I get it...
about Chris. I mean.

726
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,411
Your mother and I
want the best for you, and...

727
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,782
I can't think of anyone
better for you than him.

728
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:10,659
I want you to know...
I'm proud of you, son.

729
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,296
- For what?

730
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:17,866
- For...
- being a good human being...

731
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:27,443
and for having the fortitude
to... follow your heart.

732
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:35,350
I knew someone in
your situation once.

733
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:43,292
He wasn't nearly as
courageous as you and Chris.

734
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,296
- Yeah, I think I remember
you talking about him.

735
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:53,035
Do you know what
happened to him?

736
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,041
Is he okay?

737
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:11,653
- He is... he's fine.

738
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:16,124
- Well if you ever
want to talk about him,

739
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,593
I'll listen.

740
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:21,930
- Thank you, son.

741
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,900
(somber piano music)

742
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,120
* Looking at the sun *

743
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:49,358
* You think there's only
one light in the sky *

744
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:54,396
* You wouldn't be right *

745
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:58,100
* Wait until the night comes *

746
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:06,441
* See a trillion suns
spinning up above *

747
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:11,346
* That's how it is *

748
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:15,317
* That's how it is when *

749
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:18,120
(knocking on door)
(music stops)

750
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,231
- Have a seat.

751
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,668
- Is Sheris here?

752
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:33,969
- She's asleep.

753
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,006
- Is everything okay?

754
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:40,075
- Yeah, we're fine.

755
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,578
Now tell me about Salt Lake.

756
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:47,316
- Well, it was really
sad and really sweet.

757
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:53,055
And we said goodbye,
and... now I'm here.

758
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:57,859
- Well that doesn't
make any sense.

759
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:03,165
You guys have been at this
what, six, seven years.

760
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:08,704
I love you, no I don't,
I'm Mormon, no I'm not.

761
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:12,207
My parents will be mad if
we fuck, we shouldn't fuck.

762
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,843
Fucking is against our religion.

763
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,878
If everyone would just
stop giving a fuck about

764
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,247
who everyone else was
fucking then there wouldn't

765
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,049
be a problem.

766
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:23,785
I don't care who anyone
fucks except for Sharis.

767
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,288
Why should I care about
who that guy fucks,

768
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,459
or that guy fucks, or that
guy fucks, or that guy fucks,

769
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,628
it's all bullshit.

770
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,796
- Yeah, I agree.

771
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:40,802
- Good, so then what
are you afraid of?

772
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,740
- Nothing.

773
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:58,487
- You know there's a
community of people out there

774
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:03,759
who love you and
want you to be happy

775
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:08,163
and we want you to find love.

776
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,467
- You know, I could do it.

777
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:21,209
I could-I could compromise if
it meant living a life with him.

778
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,346
- So then why don't you?

779
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:30,018
- Because you're either gay,
or you're a man of faith...

780
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,821
but apparently
you can't be both.

781
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,093
- Hey.
- Hi.

782
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:46,268
- You know, you can tell
her to stop talking.

783
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,703
That's what I do.

784
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,975
Waking me up.

785
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:56,378
Hi.

786
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,655
I heard about Chris's mom.

787
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,127
How are you doing?

788
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:15,397
- Eh...

789
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,999
- Come here.

790
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,937
(speaks indistinctly)

791
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:33,348
- You make me feel like
a baby when you do that.

792
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,217
- Because you are one.

793
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:40,889
(upbeat electronic dance music)

794
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,693
(groaning)

795
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,496
- No, no, no.
- Do one more with me.

796
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:24,299
- No, I'm good.
- Just one more, come on.

797
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,903
- No, really, I'm good.
- Fine.

798
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,541
- You are falling apart.

799
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:37,879
- Am I? I think I'm
finally letting loose.

800
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:39,981
- Well, you've been
letting loose for a while.

801
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,684
- Well, you need to loosen up.

802
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,500
What do we do now?

803
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,638
- Well I pass out because I have
to go be an editor in the morning.

804
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,542
- No, no, no, I mean
your body of work.

805
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:11,446
Those books on the shelf, they're
filled with your feelings

806
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,981
about this man.

807
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,083
He was your muse.

808
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:20,055
- I'll find a new one.

809
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,292
- I could be your muse.

810
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,128
I make a great muse.

811
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,198
- Yeah, you are.

812
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,641
- What?

813
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,710
- Nothing.

814
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,861
(heavy breathing)

815
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,301
(grunting)

816
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,113
(belt buckle clinking)

817
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,096
(moaning)

818
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:40,302
- Okay, okay,
no, okay, okay, okay.

819
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:43,538
- He's not here.

820
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,373
- It's not about him.

821
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,009
- You're attracted to me right?

822
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:50,445
- Of course, you're beautiful.

823
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:07,228
Hey come on, please don't be...

824
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,265
Don't let this
be awkward between us.

825
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:12,200
- Too late.

826
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,836
- Look, I have feelings for you.

827
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:18,807
And they are
complicated feelings.

828
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:20,709
We just can't have sex.

829
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:23,745
It'll mess it up.

830
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,915
- We both know what it's
like to love something

831
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:30,819
that doesn't love
us back, don't we?

832
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:38,059
- Ryan... come on.

833
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,661
- What?

834
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,997
- Come here, come on.

835
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:46,267
Come here.

836
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,253
- Do you still
believe in God, RJ?

837
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:11,026
Do you think that
He's here right now?

838
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,906
Because I'm starting to
see our Heavenly Father...

839
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:31,646
like I see the Prophet
or the other leaders, as...

840
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,982
flawed men.

841
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,720
I don't want to
see Him like that.

842
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:44,292
I want to know that He's
here, and that He loves me.

843
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:50,398
- Do you feel loved right now?

844
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,471
- In this moment, I do.

845
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,277
- Then maybe He is.

846
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:14,456
- I have to admit...

847
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:18,460
I didn't want you and Chris
to work out.

848
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:19,594
- I know that.

849
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,998
- I just didn't want
to lose what we have.

850
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,471
- I am not what you want,
and I think you know that.

851
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:35,710
- I looked at you guys,
and I thought to myself,

852
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,617
"I want that... I want that.

853
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,087
Or something like that."

854
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:48,022
- You can have it.

855
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:53,428
- I want a family some day, RJ.

856
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,630
I want a Temple wedding.

857
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,133
I don't want to be told that
I'm going to be banished

858
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:00,702
to the outer darkness
for wanting that.

859
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,106
I have been to the dark places,

860
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,842
and I had to pull myself out.

861
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:12,947
I don't want to go back there.

862
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:22,257
(sobbing quietly)

863
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:36,371
- You can have all of that,
but not if you're gone.

864
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,161
- What do we do now?

865
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,339
- We call your
mission companion.

866
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:13,975
- No, no we don't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

867
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:19,747
- Come on is there a way to
get a hold of Elder Petersen?

868
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,251
- Maybe.

869
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:26,521
- Then let's call him.

870
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:30,358
- It's probably not even
his number any more.

871
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,860
Besides he wouldn't
pick up, he's probably

872
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,463
out with his friends
or something.

873
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:38,199
At BYU, it's like 2 am.

874
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:43,605
- Okay, well maybe not, but
still he wouldn't pick up.

875
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,075
- Well then it doesn't matter.

876
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:49,143
- He might be angry with me.

877
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:50,211
- Why?

878
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:56,251
- He went home for what we did.

879
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:02,590
He's ashamed.

880
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:10,231
- He could fall in
love with another boy,

881
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:15,837
or worse, he could marry
some unsuspecting girl.

882
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,139
- I've been drinking.

883
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:20,441
- That'll only help.

884
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,411
- I'll call him some other time.

885
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,747
- No, no, tonight, we're
gonna call him tonight.

886
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:28,750
- Chris never answered your
calls after your mission.

887
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:30,918
- Yeah, I didn't try hard enough.
- Well, he didn't let you.

888
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,921
- I could've tried harder.
- Don't fuck this up like I did.

889
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,256
- You didn't.

890
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,694
- Come on let me see your phone.

891
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:41,496
- It's probably dead.

892
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,236
- You're not going
to do it, come on.

893
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:50,305
- Just let me sort it out.

894
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:54,208
- His roommates are
probably out right now

895
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,810
soaking with their girlfriends.

896
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,278
- Gross.

897
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:04,585
- He's alone in his dorm,
and he wants you to call him.

898
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:05,953
- No, he doesn't.

899
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:12,960
- You know when you think
about someone you love,

900
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:16,831
it's usually because they're
thinking about you, too.

901
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:37,418
(phone ringing)

902
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,387
- [Young Man] Hello?

903
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,324
- It's Ryan.

904
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,229
I'm in Portland.

905
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,466
- [Missionary Companion]
That's cool.

906
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,701
How did you know I'd be up?

907
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,436
- Just luck, I guess.

908
01:12:56,506 --> 01:13:01,008
- [Missionary Companion]
It's nice to hear from you.

909
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,645
- It's so good to
hear your voice.

910
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:06,180
- [Missionary Companion]
It's weird you'd called,

911
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,116
I've been thinking about you.

912
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:09,450
- You have?

913
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:13,821
- [Missionary Companion] Yeah,
like all the flipping time.

914
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:21,062
- Are you alone?

915
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:25,266
- [Missionary Companion]
Yeah, are you?

916
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,035
- Yeah, I am.

917
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:32,039
- [Missionary Companion]
So, how have you been?

918
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,611
- Good.

919
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:43,451
- [Missionary Companion]
I miss you.

920
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:45,753
- I miss you, too.

921
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:49,257
- [Missionary Companion] Really?
- Yeah.

922
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:55,029
- I wish I could see your face.

923
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:01,169
- Well maybe we could
make that happen.

924
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:04,172
- [Missionary Companion] Really?
- Yeah.

925
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:13,114
- I remember how you
used to look at me.

926
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:16,451
- Like you were the only
person in the world?

927
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,352
- [Missionary Companion] Yeah.

928
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:20,755
- It's because that's all I saw.

929
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:26,594
- [Missionary Companion]
I love you.

930
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,834
- I love you, too.

931
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:34,769
(crying)

932
01:14:34,771 --> 01:14:37,505
- [Missionary Companion]
So much.

933
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:45,980
- I'm coming home,
I think it's time.

934
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:52,186
(mournful soft rock music)

935
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:05,526
(inspiring instrumental music)

936
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,109
- President, may I sit?

937
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,591
- [President Of The Quorum Of The
Twelve] Yes, brother Merrill.

938
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:34,655
Let me first say that
I am praying for you.

939
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:37,258
I've been speaking with
our Heavenly Father,

940
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,960
and He loves you.

941
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:42,863
Debbie was dear to
me and to Francis.

942
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,566
How are Chelsea, and Greg,
Chris and Kaylee?

943
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:51,205
- Well Chelsea is taking
it pretty hard, as is Greg.

944
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:55,876
Kaylee, we tell her
that Deedee has gone on

945
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:59,847
to her eternal family, but
you know, she's a child.

946
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:03,818
Chris has been a rock.

947
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,420
And he's actually a
big part of the reason

948
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:08,522
I'm here today.

949
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:10,291
- Oh?

950
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:14,629
- He suffered from same-sex
attraction for many years.

951
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:19,133
I tried, I did everything
I could to help him,

952
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,936
but I've stopped that now.

953
01:17:21,938 --> 01:17:25,072
- It's a very difficult
situation.

954
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:29,343
- I realized that he
is fine the way he is.

955
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:32,380
There's no need
for him to change.

956
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,582
- Brother Merrill,

957
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:38,452
you know that Lucifer will
try every trick to mislead us.

958
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,923
- You continue to
teach me to be open

959
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:46,694
to the promptings of the
spirit, and I feel my heart

960
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:49,764
softening towards Chris
and the many faithful

961
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:51,132
who are like him.

962
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:59,473
Where's our spirituality?

963
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:02,810
Where's our response
to the love of God?

964
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:09,016
This doesn't feel like
love, making people choose...

965
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,921
separating ourselves
from them for eternity.

966
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:21,762
Have you seen what's
happening in the world?

967
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:27,234
People are being killed,
beaten, discriminated against

968
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:32,073
every day, my son among them.

969
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:33,274
- I understand,

970
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:37,745
brother Merrill, but I
have heard from the Lord...

971
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:41,849
is that we have to proceed
as we already have.

972
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:45,953
- Well, I, too, have talked
to our Heavenly Father.

973
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:47,503
Oh, have you?

974
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:52,193
Yes and He told me that
we, the apostles, and...

975
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:57,431
the Quorum must continue
to discuss this matter.

976
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:08,743
- Alright, son, you'll
have your meeting.

977
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:14,281
In the meantime,
Noah, get some rest.

978
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:15,850
You're going through
much more now

979
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:17,618
than you may realize.

980
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:22,790
- Thank you, but I really
need to work right now.

981
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:25,960
- I understand.

982
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:27,628
Let us pray.

983
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,963
- Of course.

984
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:37,238
- Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank you for the friendships

985
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:45,379
that support us in difficult times...
when we lose family

986
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:49,250
until we see them
again in eternal life,

987
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:50,818
it is very hard.

988
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:54,321
(crying softly)

989
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:56,490
- Okay. Do you remember which
order these go in?

990
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:57,525
- Yeah.

991
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,095
- Alright, put 'em
in order for me.

992
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:12,206
Very good, good job.

993
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:17,244
So can you tell me where
Grandma is, do you remember?

994
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:20,781
Very good, that's the spirit world.
That's paradise.

995
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,583
That's where she's
waiting for all of us.

996
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,919
- Here?
- Yep, right there.

997
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:28,022
- Yeah, right there,
and one day, we will all

998
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:30,858
be together right here.

999
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:34,361
So it'll be you, and me, and
Mommy's going to be there,

1000
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:38,566
and your Grandma, and we
will all be together forever.

1001
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:40,501
- RJ, too?

1002
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:46,774
- Yeah, of course,
he'll be there.

1003
01:20:50,213 --> 01:20:52,613
Of course, he'll be there, baby.

1004
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,918
Oh, your Mommy's going to
be here in a few minutes.

1005
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,720
Do you want to go
outside and wait for her?

1006
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:01,222
See if we can see her drive up?

1007
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1008
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:47,902
- You promise you're not mad
that I'm not going to BYU?

1009
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:49,336
- I'm not mad.

1010
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:51,972
This makes so more sense.

1011
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:54,675
You won't have to
disrupt Kaylee's life.

1012
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:57,878
This place is beautiful.

1013
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,313
- Yeah.

1014
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:01,181
It's the right thing.

1015
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:09,456
I was thinking about our
dinner with the Smiths,

1016
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:12,159
and how much I wished your
mom could have been there

1017
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:14,261
for that.

1018
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:23,137
It had a life marker
feel about it.

1019
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:32,146
It's inspired me to
bring some matters up

1020
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:34,148
before the Quorum.

1021
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:37,484
I'm going to broach the
subject of the new policy

1022
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:40,955
and also same-sex
marriage in the Church.

1023
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,095
What do you think about that?

1024
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:56,870
- I don't think I ever told
you this, but... while I was

1025
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:02,476
in therapy... they told
me time and again,

1026
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,980
you can choose God or
you can choose love.

1027
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:10,784
Well, to me, they're
one in the same.

1028
01:23:10,786 --> 01:23:14,421
My own daughter knows
that, a child knows that.

1029
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,561
I'm not going to let
anyone tell me who I can

1030
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:25,199
and can't be with... and I'm
not going to let anyone...

1031
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:28,435
define those choices
for me either.

1032
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:38,946
This meeting with the
President, with the Quorum...

1033
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,652
thank you, but I hope you're
not doing it just for me.

1034
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,390
I hope you're doing
it because you know

1035
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:51,992
it's the right thing to do.

1036
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:58,265
- As a member of the
Quorum, I'm limited.

1037
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:02,136
I'm one voice in that
room, but I'm going to have

1038
01:24:02,138 --> 01:24:04,071
your mom with me.

1039
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:14,481
You know... when I saw
you and RJ together,

1040
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:18,318
when he had his panic attack,
and you ran after him...

1041
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,388
reassured him, talked
him through it.

1042
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:26,760
That reminded me so
much of your mom and I,

1043
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:29,096
and how we cared for each other.

1044
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:31,398
That's love.

1045
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,268
I saw that with you.

1046
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:40,474
It's like a dream...

1047
01:24:40,476 --> 01:24:44,011
this life,
it only lasts so long.

1048
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,386
I love you, son.

1049
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,522
- I love you, too, Dad.

1050
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:00,828
- God, I miss her.

1051
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:03,764
- Me too.

1052
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:09,736
* His love shall light my way *

1053
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:14,274
* Through darkness
and through doubt *

1054
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:18,212
* Imprisoned by uncertainty *

1055
01:25:19,048 --> 01:25:22,850
* His love has brought me out *

1056
01:25:24,053 --> 01:25:26,687
(wind blowing)

1057
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:36,196
(breathing tiredly)

1058
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:44,304
(slow, soft piano music)

1059
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:41,728
(knocking on door frame)

1060
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:49,736
(laughing)

1061
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:52,472
(soft piano music quickens)

1062
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:57,110
- Hey.
- Hi.

1063
01:26:57,112 --> 01:26:58,645
- How long have you been here?

1064
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:00,681
- Three and a half hours.

1065
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:02,482
- I'm so sorry.

1066
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:03,550
- It's okay.

1067
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:06,553
- You got into law school.

1068
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,289
- I did. (laughing)

1069
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:11,091
(kissing)

1070
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:16,563
- Congratulations.
- Thank you... Oh, okay.

1071
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:53,000
(belt buckle clinking)

1072
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:39,680
(laughing)

1073
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:58,365
- Have you had time... to think?

1074
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:15,549
You don't have to
be strong for me.

1075
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:36,903
(crying quietly)

1076
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:49,750
- I never got to say goodbye.

1077
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:54,821
She was so good.

1078
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:57,457
(sobbing loudly)

1079
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:01,755
(hopeful, uplifting
orchestral music)

1080
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:32,185
(wheels rolling across pavement)

1081
01:31:32,187 --> 01:31:36,690
(people conversing
loudly on street)

1082
01:31:53,909 --> 01:31:57,310
(laughing and shouting)

1083
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:43,056
- [Voicemail Recording] Hi, you've reached
the voice-mail box of Christopher Merrill.

1084
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:46,593
- Chris, as a member of
the Quorum of the Twelve,

1085
01:32:46,595 --> 01:32:49,563
I have to tell you that
I cannot support you,

1086
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:53,700
but as your father,
you have my blessing.

1087
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:56,536
You don't need it,
but you have it.

1088
01:33:09,785 --> 01:33:12,152
- Hey, hey, you have time.

1089
01:33:12,154 --> 01:33:13,820
You're not going to
miss your flight.

1090
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:16,122
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1091
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:25,532
What's in going to be like
when you start school?

1092
01:33:25,534 --> 01:33:28,101
- Well, you know there's
going to be breaks every now

1093
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:33,940
and then, and it's
only three years.

1094
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:37,444
- A lot can happen
in three years.

1095
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:39,479
- Yeah.

1096
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:40,747
- I just feel like
you're going to leave,

1097
01:33:40,749 --> 01:33:43,216
and everything's
going to be the same.

1098
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:44,884
- RJ, I know why
you feel that way.

1099
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:47,087
- I prayed this morning.

1100
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:54,327
I prayed for Heavenly
Father to give me strength.

1101
01:33:54,329 --> 01:33:58,164
I prayed for strength
to let us go,

1102
01:33:59,368 --> 01:34:01,735
so that you could attend to
matters in your own life,

1103
01:34:01,737 --> 01:34:03,870
and I could do the same.

1104
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:09,909
I know that the Church
has betrayed us...

1105
01:34:11,213 --> 01:34:19,185
and it's excluded us, and
it's been... heart breaking...

1106
01:34:19,187 --> 01:34:20,987
but when you're
wrapped up in it,

1107
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,822
I can't live without it.

1108
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:35,769
- I know it's been really
crazy the last couple

1109
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:39,506
of weeks, and for my part,
I apologize for that...

1110
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:46,079
but if it's taught me anything,

1111
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:49,015
it's that life is way too short.

1112
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:54,454
For the first time in my
life, I know what I want

1113
01:34:54,456 --> 01:34:55,955
and who I want.

1114
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,426
I want you.

1115
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:08,068
And Kaylee, and the Church,
I want it all...

1116
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,071
because we deserve it.

1117
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:13,440
- I want it all, too.

1118
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:15,809
I want everything.

1119
01:35:15,811 --> 01:35:19,679
It belongs to us as much as
it belongs to anyone else...

1120
01:35:21,283 --> 01:35:25,819
and nobody can tell us
what our options are...

1121
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:28,121
and I don't want to
fuck around anymore.

1122
01:35:35,197 --> 01:35:40,667
- Well, I had this whole
other thing planned.

1123
01:35:48,944 --> 01:35:52,378
I called your dad recently...

1124
01:35:54,549 --> 01:35:59,719
and the reason I called him was to
ask his permission to marry his son.

1125
01:36:24,746 --> 01:36:26,412
Will you marry me?

1126
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:34,621
- Yes...
- (crying quietly)

1127
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,656
I love you.

1128
01:36:37,759 --> 01:36:39,526
- I love you so much.

1129
01:36:48,036 --> 01:36:50,837
I will never leave you again.

1130
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:07,120
You need some tissue?

1131
01:37:07,122 --> 01:37:08,621
- No, no I'm okay.

1132
01:37:10,559 --> 01:37:13,059
- I have a plane to catch.

1133
01:37:13,061 --> 01:37:15,562
- You said you would never leave.
- Just this once.

1134
01:37:15,564 --> 01:37:17,397
- Okay.
- Okay.

1135
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:28,842
- Our dear Heavenly Father,
we're so very grateful

1136
01:37:28,844 --> 01:37:33,479
for this blessed day, to be
here, with these two young men.

1137
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:36,182
We pray that thy
spirit will be with us,

1138
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:39,052
and it will bless them
and strengthen them

1139
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:41,588
as they endure life's
challenges together.

1140
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:44,157
We pray that all will be
enriched by this experience

1141
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:45,625
as we leave today,

1142
01:37:45,627 --> 01:37:48,862
and that we will always
remember to treat thy children

1143
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:53,132
with the utmost of love,
kindness, and patience,

1144
01:37:53,134 --> 01:37:55,735
and we ask these things
humbly in the name of thy Son,

1145
01:37:55,737 --> 01:37:57,637
Jesus Christ, Amen.

1146
01:37:57,639 --> 01:37:59,272
- [Together] Amen.

1147
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:05,245
- And now the rings.

1148
01:38:07,515 --> 01:38:11,684
(sweet music plays quietly)

1149
01:38:25,367 --> 01:38:29,002
Brethren, do you take
one another by the hand

1150
01:38:30,472 --> 01:38:34,173
and receive each other to
be your lawful and wedded

1151
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:37,310
husband for time
and all eternity,

1152
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:43,049
and this you do in the
presence of God, angels,

1153
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:49,622
and these witnesses of your
own free will and choice?

1154
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:51,291
- Yes.

1155
01:38:51,793 --> 01:38:53,159
- Yes.

1156
01:38:54,362 --> 01:38:58,665
- By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husbands.

1157
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:06,639
(crowd applauding loudly)

1158
01:39:29,864 --> 01:39:37,603
- [RJ] My name is RJ Smith, and I
married Chris, the love of my life...

1159
01:39:37,605 --> 01:39:41,374
in December of 2016,
in Portland, Oregon,

1160
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:46,779
our families were both there,

1161
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:49,482
including my stepdaughter
Kaylee.

1162
01:39:52,287 --> 01:39:55,088
I soon moved to
Salt Lake with them.

1163
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:59,092
I got a job as an
adjunct professor

1164
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:05,798
at the University of Utah,
and I finished my new book.

1165
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:12,872
I finally found a way to join the
two opposing sides of myself.

1166
01:40:14,376 --> 01:40:17,510
(twinkling piano music)

1167
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:23,216
My first day in our home,
we knelt down and prayed.

1168
01:40:26,888 --> 01:40:31,758
Chris said to me softly,
"This is it."

1169
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,295
This is what we have.

1170
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:42,702
"This is what we've
been fighting for."

1171
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:49,142
He said it was all worth it...
and he was right.

1172
01:40:52,914 --> 01:40:57,116
