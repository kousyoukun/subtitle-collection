1
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:55,424
我仍然不知道 世界之大 何处为家
I still don't know where we fit in the world.

2
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:03,931
我以为放弃信仰就能减轻
I thought leaving faith behind would relieve

3
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,067
我一直以来的负罪感
the dissonance I always felt.

4
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:11,472
并没有
It didn't.

5
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:20,080
一路走来 才发现我一直试图抓住某些价值
Through it all, I find myself holding onto these values.

6
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:25,852
我曾经的属灵同伴 Chris也一样 
So does Chris, my former mission companion.

7
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:29,589
出于某些原因 在探索这条道路上
For one reason or another, we've had trouble

8
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,158

我已经一年没有见过他了
It's been a year since I've seen him,

10
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:40,535
明天他就要回来北镇了
and tomorrow, he comes back to the Northwest.

11
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:46,007
我们已经说好忘记以前的事重新开始
We've agreed to put it all behind us and start fresh,

12
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:52,179
不受教会家庭和距离或者其它什么事
uninhibited by the Church, our families, distance,

13
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,047
的影响
or anything else.

14
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:56,583
这是我们应得的
We deserve that.

15
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:00,520
所有人都是
Everyone does.

16
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:06,026
* 你是否想坠落 *
* Don't you wanna fall *

17
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:07,128
* 你是否想翱翔 *

19
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,570

20
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,888

I cannot believe you're going to be here tomorrow.

22

我想别人肯定很疑惑
I just think people were legitimately confused

83
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:16,977
为什么两个男人会在我父母的结婚纪念日上接吻

00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:07,287

It's just that she knew you were talking about me,

115
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,304
这有点
and it was like...

116

我知道 这就是为什么我要道歉
I know that's why I'm apologizing.

I'm not trying to get you drunk, it's just happening.

我们为什么需要这么久才能变得舒适
Why does it take us so long to get comfortable?

133

我不知道
I don't know.

134
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:58,792
感觉在你面前 我还是会紧张

144
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:17,001
还有喝酒
and you're drinking beer.

145
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:20,407
要不要做点像盐湖城那种疯狂事
And what about the Salt Lake City thing?

146
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,841
什么方面的
What about it?

147
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:24,745
你敢吗
Could you do it?

148
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:27,847
我觉得你勉强可以
I think you could barely do it.

149
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:31,851
额 我想最好还是不要
Well, maybe you won't have to.

150
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,060
好
Okay.

151
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:41,795
你要去哪
Where are you going?

152
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:44,364
我进去拿点啤酒
I am headed back to your house to get some more beer.

153
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,532
你不是说过不喝酒的嘛
I thought you said you weren't drinking.

154
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:48,768
帅哥 都是你惹的
You, sir, have opened the flood gates.

155
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,870
我已经没有退路了
I'm past the point of no return.

156
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,873
别走 这事可不能怪我
You can't just say that and then walk away.

157
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,374
太迟了
Too late.

158
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:55,742
拜托 
Come on, ugh.

159
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:07,998
你会没事的
You'll be okay.

160
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:14,360
- 我认为它  - 有点干
- I think it's... - It's a little dry.

161
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,264
我们会没事的
We'll be okay.

162
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,399
我很好
I'm good.

163
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:31,344
- 嘿 你 额   - 自从上次分开
- Hey did you... - sleep with anybody else

164
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:32,913
你和其它人做过吗
since I saw you last?

165
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:36,983
离开盐湖城后我和Paul做过一次
I had sex with Paul after Salt Lake.

166
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,385
这个我知道
I knew about that.

167
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:40,994
我说的是之后
I saw you after that.

168
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,957
有 我只是不知道还能再见到你
Yeah, I just didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

169
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:45,959
别担心
Don't worry about it.

170
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:51,932
你有男朋友吗
Was there anybody else?

171
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:57,604
嗯 或者一夜情什么的 
Um, like a night here, and a night there, but nothing real.

172
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:06,846
耶 我有破坏婚姻的坏习惯
Yeah, I had to break a couple bad habits myself.

173
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:08,648
还有什么比这更坏
What makes them bad?

174
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,053
只是 换个地方
Just, oing places, and...

175
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,260
认识新朋友
meeting people.

176
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,472
你觉得怎么样
What do you think about that?

177
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:37,544
我觉得我们不应该一直这样
I think that we shouldn't feel like we're bad people

178
00:14:37,546 --> 00:14:38,945
妄自菲薄
all the time.

179
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:43,917
做爱很正常 你懂的 我们是需要发泄的
It's okay to have sex, you know, we're supposed to cum.

180
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,286
我们本应该如此的
We're supposed to cum.

181
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:50,290
我们是动物 这很正常
We are animals, it's okay.

182
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,626
我们很正常
We're okay.

183
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:59,499
不要 不要随意断定我
You're not, you're not going to judge me?

184
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:00,600
我没有
No.

185
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:04,991
我只是希望我们能够打开天窗说亮话
I just wanted to get it all out in the open.

186
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:07,841
耶 这样很好
Yeah, it's fine.

187
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:13,913
我们把所有的事情摊开讲清楚
We can get everything out in the open.

188
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:19,586
还有多少件事没有摊开讲
Every last thing we can get out in the open.

189
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:28,461
三 二 一
Three, two... one.

190
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:38,831

来杯咖啡吗
Do you want some coffee?

193
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,813
我是摩门教的 先生
I am a Mormon, sir.

194
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:56,983
现在才说你是摩门教的
So now you're a Mormon?

195
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:57,985
阿门
Amen.

196

快点 来吧
Come on, go.

204
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,726
我还没有准备好
I wasn't ready for that.

205
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,991
那你为什么叫我做
Then why did you tell me to do it?

206
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,998
开个玩笑
I'm just kidding.

207
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:54,407
我去做煮早餐
I'll go make us some breakfast.

208
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:20,533
嘿 你想吃什么类型的煮鸡蛋
Hey, how do you want your eggs cooked?

209
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,978
怎么什么都这么亮
Everything's so bright.

210
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:34,948

It's called day.

不用谢
You're welcome.

213
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:47,994
你头在哪受伤的 那里
Where does your head hurt, there?

214
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,562

219
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,995
"新来的教会指导表示同性家庭的孩子
"New IDS guidelines say children of same-sex couples...

220
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,998
不能接受洗礼仪式"
will not be baptized in the Church."

221
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,908
我知道你想争论这个
I know you want to discuss this,

222
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,409
但是能不能给我点时间

223
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:12,591
- 读完这篇报道  - 他们开玩笑的 对吗
- to read the whole article. - They're joking, right?

224
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:21,554
上面说由于同志家庭的小孩不能被同等对待
It says they're doing this for their own protection,

225
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,993
所以这样做是为了
that children from gay marriages can't be treated

226
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:25,558
保护他们
like everyone else.

227
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:32,498
免受更多来自同志父母的罪恶
Punishing children for the sins of their own fathers.

228
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,801
真不敢相信
We don't even believe in that.

229
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,606
你可以随你瞎掰
You can interpret this any way you want,

230
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:41,741
但是我受够了
but I am done.

231
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,645

I don't think you mean that.

245
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:29,992
不清楚
Not sure.

246
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:31,891
一切都还好吧
Is everything okay?

247
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:35,361
不怎么好 不过我没事

251
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:47,373
哦
Oh?

252
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:53,713
什么 你和女人结过婚的 这无所谓的
What, you were married to a woman once, you'll be fine.

253

It's mostly word of mouth, but he's giving me lots

288
00:23:12,997 --> 00:23:14,427
of practice.

289
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:18,798
We all know how tense he gets, right.

290
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,901
Wow, maybe like a website or business cards.

291
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:25,104
Yeah, you know, I gotta handle that side as well.

292
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:28,107
I'm feeling it out, literally.

293
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:32,111
- Good card. - It's so accurate, too.

294
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,913
- Your turn. - Oh, sure, okay.

295
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:36,382
Lifetime presents, A Sad Handjob: The Story

296
00:23:36,384 --> 00:23:39,151
of a Homoerotic Volleyball Montage.

297
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:41,454
I'd watch that.

298
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:47,994
I can't believe I'm smoking pot with you, Chris.

299
00:23:47,796 --> 00:23:49,989
Your dad's a member of the Quorum.

300
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:51,531
Yes he is.

301
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,866
- Yeah, that's a tough
one for us right now.

302
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:00,137
- Yeah, I heard...
- but to be expected.

303
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,075
- So where did you serve
your mission, Ryan?

304
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:08,179
- I spent my mission
in Mexico City

305
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:15,519
It was beautiful...
and so was my companion.

306
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,126
For a year straight...

307
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,831
he would always change
in front of me...

308
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,135
totally innocent,
but he knew what he was doing.

309
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,973
And then one night,
we were on a bus

310
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:40,411
heading back to our district, and
I fell asleep on his shoulder.

311
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,781
While I was sleeping,
he had taken my hand,

312
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:47,084
and he was holding it
in a patriarchal grip.

313
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:51,522
I woke up... like this...

314
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:54,692
and I looked up
into his eyes, and...

315
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:59,730
I saw a lust and love
and longing...

316
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:07,571
but I also saw
this deep sadness...

317
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,877
because we both knew

318
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:16,914
we could never be together...

319
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:22,019
and it would just be this moment
in the back of a bus.

320
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,791
We got sent home shortly after.

321
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,695
I haven't seen him since.

322
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,609
But seeing you guys
together after so long...

323
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,077
it gives me hope.

324
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,749
I'm going to go.

325
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,018
- Really?

326
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,188
- Yeah...
- It was nice to meet you.

327
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,557
- Yeah, you too.

328
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,859
- Are you okay?

329
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,594
- Not really.

330
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,996
- Hey, hey, hey...

331
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,171
Love you.

332
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,507
- Love you, too.

333
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,752
- Where did you guys meet?

334
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,621
- Um, we met at Affirmations.

335
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,615
It's like a support group
for recovering Mormons.

336
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,715
- Yeah, I know what it is.

337
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,329
- Yeah, his parents kicked
him out of the house.

338
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,763
- Wow.

339
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,334
- I don't know,
I feel bad for him.

340
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,137
He's out here without
no family or friends.

341
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,407
- Wow.

342
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,278
- You okay?

343
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:56,680
- Yeah.

344
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,352
- You coming?

345
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:02,419
- Yeah.

346
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,261
- Oops, sorry.
- It's okay.

347
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,611
- Have you and Ryan ever...?

348
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,216
- No.

349
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,360
- He sure loves you.

350
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,770
- Do you love me?

351
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,370
- Do you want some water?

352
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,839
What are those?

353
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,042
- Oh, I have pressure
points in my back.

354
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,844
- What's wrong with your back?

355
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:51,148
- Just all those years of
carrying around a heavy suitcase.

356
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,986
- Thank you.

357
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,287
- Yeah.

358
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,098
- Whoa, it got chilly.

359
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,181
Can I ask you something?

360
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,215
- Sure.

361
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,786
- Would you consider going to
a sacrament meeting with me?

362
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:36,593
- Chris, I just don't
know what the point is.

363
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,328
- I don't think it's
coincidence that you live

364
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,664
only a few blocks
away from the war.

365
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,367
It's not too late to come back.

366
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,235
- Where do you think I've gone?

367
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,372
- Not far, unless all of that
stuff in your living room

368
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,740
is just for show.

369
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:51,942
- I'm still trying to figure
out what they're trying

370
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,411
to say with this announcement.

371
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:01,518
By the way...
did you know?

372
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
- What?

373
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,822
- About the policy, did
you know before they made

374
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,157
the announcement?

375
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,860
- No... You honestly think
that I knew about that.

376
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:14,698
- I don't know, I just... I don't
know, I thought that if you did,

377
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,701
maybe there was something
you could've done about it.

378
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,803
- I don't know.
- Like what?

379
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,439
- Talk to your father.

380
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,309
- What possible
good would that do?

381
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,683
- I don't know, he's
like an inside voice.

382
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:35,719
One of the twelve
apostles has a gay son.

383
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,054
I mean if that's not a prophecy,

384
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:41,058
then I don't know what is.

385
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,597
Do you ever think about it?

386
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,368
What it would be like?

387
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,336
- What?

388
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,838
- I think about it
all the time...

389
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,675
with you, getting married...

390
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:06,984
in the Church with
the Sealer above us,

391
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,453
my parents and your parents.

392
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:17,594
I do... but it's not
going to happen.

393
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,097
Not like that.

394
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,434
You know what the Church does?

395
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:27,104
They convince me more and
more that maybe Joseph Smith

396
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:28,939
really did make it all up.

397
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,540
- Don't do that.

398
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,609
- How can you be a part of
something that alienates

399
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,679
parents from their children?

400
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,215
Don't you understand
what this means for you?

401
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,283
- I've stuck with the
Church through all of its

402
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,886
flaws and idiosyncrasies,
just like I've stuck with you

403
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,755
through all of these years.

404
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,723
- What are you talking about?

405
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,825
I'm done with it,
I've had my fill.

406
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,328
- No, you gave up,
that's different.

407
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,130
- And you don't have
the courage to leave.

408
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,865
- I don't want to leave.

409
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,235
- How are you okay with
the way the treat you,

410
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:01,571
or the way they treat your
family or your daughter?

411
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,407
As a father, how
do you accept that?

412
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,842
- Everything I do is for her.

413
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,112
You can question my beliefs
as a man of the faith,

414
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:12,549
but don't you ever question
my devotion to my daughter.

415
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,950
- I'm sorry.

416
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:19,456
I'm sorry.

417
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,861
- What am I doing here?

418
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,498
What am I doing?

419
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,738
I just feel obligated
to you, you know.

420
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,941
I just keep coming
back and coming back

421
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:40,377
because it's all that I know.

422
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,612
- Wow.

423
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,362
- Ricky?

424
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:05,836
- Hey... are you alright?

425
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:07,237
Hey.

426
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,939
What's wrong?

427
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:10,841
Are you alright?

428
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,743
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy,

429
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,212
Okay.

430
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:21,051
What's wrong? Hey, look at me...
I'm right here.

431
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:26,823
Breathe... Are you alright?

432
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,959
- I get these sometimes.

433
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:33,964
- Hey, hey... Alright,

434
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,933
Alright.

435
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,238
Back to real life.

436
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,575
- This is real life.

437
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:26,183
I'm sorry we keep
fucking things up.

438
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,585
- You don't have to be sorry.

439
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,032
- Okay.

440
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,267
- Thanks.

441
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,592
- Call Chris.

442
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,930
- Say the list
number of the one you...

443
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:03,099
Calling the mobile
number for Chris.

444
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,714
- Hello.

445
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:22,886
- Chris, Chris, I just heard.

446
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,954
I'm so sorry.

447
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,257
Is there anything I can I do?

448
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,284
Would you consider
coming to Salt Lake?

449
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,296
Yeah.

450
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,633
- I can make
all the arrangements.

451
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:38,935
- No, don't worry about it.
- I'll get there.

452
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,906
- The service is tomorrow.

453
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,174
- Yeah, that's fine.

454
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:48,244
- Okay,
I'll send you all the details.

455
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,712
I'll see you soon.

456
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,314
- Are you okay?

457
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,989
- It'll just be
good to have you here.

458
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,425
- Yeah, I want to
be there with you.

459
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,428
- I'll see you soon, RJ.

460
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,298
- Okay, I love you.

461
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:18,141
- Elder Merrill's
gonna pitch a fit when he sees you.

462
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:21,544
I think I'd like
to be there with you.

463
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,580
- Uh...

464
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,150
- I just-I think I should
do it alone.

465
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:33,056
- Look, son,
I never told you this, but...

466
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,494
I had a conversation with him.

467
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:38,928
- Wait, when?

468
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:44,667
- We talked when you were
in Salt Lake City with Chris.

469
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:49,272
I was a bit direct.

470
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,075
- How so?

471
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,744
- Doesn't matter now.

472
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,146
Back then I had my reasons.

473
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,919
- Um... okay.

474
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,689
What does Mom think?

475
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:10,426
- She backs me up on this.

476
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,762
- What about your foot?

477
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,064
- It'll be fine, RJ.

478
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,335
- Okay.

479
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:23,540
- Alright, son, I'll see you
in the morning in Salt Lake.

480
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,341
- Yeah, I'll see
you in the morning.

481
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,143
- Alright, bye.
- Bye.

482
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,651
- Where are you headed today?

483
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:35,718
- Uh, Utah.

484
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,488
- Will you be checking
any bags today?

485
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,856
- No thanks.

486
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:42,992
- There you go, sir,
have a good flight.

487
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,494
- Thank you.

488
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,617
- Hi, thank you.

489
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,260
Hey.

490
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,568
Hi.
Thank you for coming.

491
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,304
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

492
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,353
- Hi, Kaylee.

493
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,721
- Hi.

494
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:52,989
- You look really pretty.

495
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,691
- Thank you.
- I like your shoes.

496
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,159
- Thank you.

497
00:44:56,161 --> 00:44:57,627
- She gets a little shy.

498
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:58,995
- It's okay.

499
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,405
- I'm glad you're here.

500
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:10,773
- Me too.

501
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:16,979
- Hey, shall I take
her for a little why?

502
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:19,671
Yeah absolutely, you wanna
go with Grandma, honey?

503
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:20,583
Yeah.

504
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,985
I'll see you later, sweetie.

505
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:32,295
You look good.

506
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,330
- You too.
- Thanks.

507
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,201
- I'm sorry.
- It's a very tough situation.

508
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:41,270
- It's challenging, yeah.
- Yeah.

509
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:43,239
- Are you okay?

510
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,908
- Yeah, he's walking over here.

511
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:50,580
- It's gonna be fine.
- I'm right here.

512
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,749
- I think they're
starting to recognize me.

513
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,450
- They probably are.

514
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,254
Hey, just don't kiss me.

515
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,825
Sorry, that wasn't funny.

516
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:12,552
- RJ.

517
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:15,471
- Elder Merrill, I want you to
know I'm very sorry for your loss.

518
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,206
- I appreciate that.

519
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,443
Chris didn't tell me
that you were coming.

520
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,178
- I invited him, Dad.

521
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,382
- Elder Merrill,
I'm Tom Smith, RJ's father.

522
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:27,950
- Oh, right.

523
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,055
- I can't begin to know what
you're going through right now.

524
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:37,360
Saying sorry isn't enough
to express my sympathies.

525
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:42,398
- Thank you, Brother Smith.

526
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,434
- And you must be Chris, brother Smith.
- Yes.

527
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:50,907
I've heard so many
great things about you.

528
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:53,609
Welcome.

529
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,511
What happened?

530
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,180
- Oh, an accident at work.

531
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,918
- Elder Smith,
I thought that was you.

532
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,487
How are you?

533
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,529
- RJ, are you okay, son?

534
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,131
- I'm sorry.

535
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16,899
- RJ?

536
00:47:19,938 --> 00:47:21,704
- Excuse me.

537
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,582
Easy, hey, easy.

538
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,185
- I'm so sorry.

539
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,187
- It's okay.

540
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:39,522
- That was so weird.
- Yeah.

541
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,893
- Our mission president...

542
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:47,263
and the look that your father
gave me, he hates me.

543
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:50,266
- Okay. Okay.
- He doesn't hate you.

544
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,134
- I just wanted to
be here for you.

545
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:55,972
- You are, you're here.

546
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,007
Rest.

547
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:01,978
Easy, easy, easy.

548
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:07,283
There we go, there
we go, there we go.

549
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,124
- They're gonna be alright.

550
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,693
- Yeah, why don't you
and RJ stick around,

551
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:19,795
and we'll get some dinner?

552
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:23,099
- Oh, Elder Merrill, I couldn't
intrude on your mourning.

553
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,166
- We need to have a talk.

554
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,602
We need to have a
candid conversation,

555
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,337
and I would like you and RJ

556
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,540
to join us for dinner tonight,
alright?

557
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:32,742
- Absolutely.

558
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,243
- Good, thank you.

559
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:00,569
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

560
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,179
So, I hear you're
going to law school.

561
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,714
- I'm still applying.

562
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:13,182
- I bet your mother was proud.

563
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,617
- Yeah, she was.

564
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,822
As far as she was concerned,
I was already practicing law.

565
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:22,892
- My old mission companion
became an attorney.

566
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:26,796
I saw him and some of my
other companions recently.

567
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:32,234
We met up for a night, and
life didn't skip a beat,

568
00:49:32,236 --> 00:49:34,270
let me tell you.

569
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:37,073
We picked up right
where we left off.

570
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,309
We shared our blessings,
and our tragedies,

571
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:44,180
love and heartbreak.

572
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:51,220
Some of them... I had no idea
what they were going through

573
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,822
back then.

574
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,195
It's nice to have
people in your life

575
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,097
you can depend on.

576
00:50:03,935 --> 00:50:06,836
- I'm Greg, Chris's brother.

577
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:09,372
- Thomas Smith, RJ's father.

578
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,773
- It's good to see you again.

579
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,274
- Thank you.

580
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:22,451
Did you know my mother?

581
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:25,755
- Okay, Greg, I know that
you don't care much for me,

582
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,456
so maybe we should...

583
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:31,560
- I would like to sit
here and mourn my mother

584
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:34,730
without the shadow
of my brother's past

585
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:37,266
looming over this sacred moment.

586
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,004
- I'm sorry.
- May I have that?

587
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,173
- You're really going to
do this right now, Greg?

588
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:48,077
- Our father asked me to
be here, and here I am.

589
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:52,214
Dad.

590
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:56,986
- Boys, Brother Smith, RJ.

591
00:50:56,988 --> 00:50:58,454
- Elder Merrill.

592
00:50:58,456 --> 00:50:59,955
- Good to see you.

593
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,731
- I didn't know what to get, so I
got a variety of foods, pad Thai.

594
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,800
- I hope Thai is
good for everyone.

595
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:14,537
We didn't have much left
after the reception, so...

596
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:17,706
Looks good, nice and hot.

597
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,875
Brother Smith, would
you like to pray for us?

598
00:51:19,877 --> 00:51:23,212
- Elder Merrill, I'd
be honored if a member

599
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,381
of the Quorum would
say a blessing.

600
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:29,185
- Okay, call me Noah, alright?

601
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,253
- Let's pray.

602
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:37,693
Our Heavenly Father,
thank you for bringing

603
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:41,530
Tom and RJ safely to us
today and as our families

604
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,966
come together, please help
us guide our conversation,

605
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:47,870
help us discover what
is best for everyone,

606
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,005
in the name of
Jesus Christ, Amen.

607
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,540
- Amen.

608
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:09,892
- Brother Smith and RJ,
thank you both

609
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:14,230
for being here today, it was
very gracious of you to come.

610
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:22,505
I have to make clear right
now and bear testimony

611
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:25,374
to each of you that...

612
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,478
sexual relations

613
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,349
between two of the
same sex is wrong.

614
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:37,319
By doing so, our children
become apostates,

615
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,990
and should be culled
from the kingdom.

616
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:44,393
Now the rest of the world may
be taking a different path,

617
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:48,097
but we remain faithful
to the Gospel.

618
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:50,966
- You've made some pretty
bold assumptions, Dad.

619
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:53,602
- I've seen it with
my own eyes, Chris.

620
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,037
I've read his book.

621
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,806
- There's a book?

622
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:01,243
- It's a detailed account
of their mission together.

623
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:04,013
And you, how do you feel
about this, having your

624
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,882
adventures out there in
print for everyone to see?

625
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,617
- I wouldn't want them in print.

626
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:11,554
- Well, no one would read
a book about you, Greg.

627
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,390
- Did you read the whole thing?

628
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:17,459
- I read as much as I could.

629
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,495
- What about the part when
they helped the veteran

630
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:24,366
with PTSD make his peace with
heavenly Father and himself.

631
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,035
Did you read that?

632
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,539
- Your son and I fell in love.

633
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:36,345
We did things that people do
when they love each other.

634
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:41,016
- Faith isn't a Kinsey scale.

635
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:42,918
You're either a man of faith,
or you're not.

636
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,189
- Elder Merrill, I can assure you, RJ...
- Dad.

637
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,658
Like it or not,
I'm in your life.

638
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:56,198
A man of God or not, I feel the
loss of this woman tonight,

639
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,267
and I feel it through him.

640
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:04,039
And he's a man that I love
and whose family I love.

641
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:13,015
- My mother would've loved you.

642
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:16,285
Just like I do.

643
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:32,268
- So what's this
going to look like?

644
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,570
- What's what
going to look like?

645
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:35,938
- This.

646
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:37,773
- What?

647
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,409
You two, with him in Seattle?

648
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:42,611
- Well, RJ moved
to Portland, Dad.

649
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,680
- Well, that's the same thing.

650
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:46,148
Kaylee's in Salt Lake City.

651
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,755
- RJ and I aren't
together right now.

652
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,625
- Wait a minute, I thought
that you guys were...

653
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:58,862
ya know.

654
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:03,565
- Yeah why not? I just heard
you say that you love him.

655
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:20,449
Do you mind if I ask
what the problem is?

656
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:30,025
- The Church... and where
we fit inside of it all.

657
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:31,360
We don't know.

658
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,533
- I see.

659
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:49,778
Thanks.

660
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,715
RJ, thank you for
being here for Chris.

661
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,483
- Mm-hmm.

662
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,664
- Thank you for coming.

663
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:38,761
- Son, give me a hand.
- Thanks.

664
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:49,905
You know, RJ, I get it...
about Chris. I mean.

665
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,411
Your mother and I
want the best for you, and...

666
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,782
I can't think of anyone
better for you than him.

667
00:57:05,356 --> 00:57:10,659
I want you to know...
I'm proud of you, son.

668
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:14,296
- For what?

669
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:17,866
- For...
- being a good human being...

670
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:27,443
and for having the fortitude
to... follow your heart.

671
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:35,350
I knew someone in
your situation once.

672
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:43,292
He wasn't nearly as
courageous as you and Chris.

673
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,296
- Yeah, I think I remember
you talking about him.

674
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:53,035
Do you know what
happened to him?

675
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,041
Is he okay?

676
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:11,653
- He is... he's fine.

677
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:16,124
- Well if you ever
want to talk about him,

678
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,593
I'll listen.

679
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:21,930
- Thank you, son.

680
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,120
* Looking at the sun *

681
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:49,358
* You think there's only
one light in the sky *

682
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:54,396
* You wouldn't be right *

683
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:58,100
* Wait until the night comes *

684
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:06,441
* See a trillion suns
spinning up above *

685
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:11,346
* That's how it is *

686
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:15,317
* That's how it is when *

687
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,231
- Have a seat.

688
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,668
- Is Sheris here?

689
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:33,969
- She's asleep.

690
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,006
- Is everything okay?

691
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:40,075
- Yeah, we're fine.

692
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,578
Now tell me about Salt Lake.

693
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:47,316
- Well, it was really
sad and really sweet.

694
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:53,055
And we said goodbye,
and... now I'm here.

695
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:57,859
- Well that doesn't
make any sense.

696
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:03,165
You guys have been at this
what, six, seven years.

697
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:08,704
I love you, no I don't,
I'm Mormon, no I'm not.

698
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:12,207
My parents will be mad if
we fuck, we shouldn't fuck.

699
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:14,843
Fucking is against our religion.

700
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,878
If everyone would just
stop giving a fuck about

701
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,247
who everyone else was
fucking then there wouldn't

702
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,049
be a problem.

703
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:23,785
I don't care who anyone
fucks except for Sharis.

704
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,288
Why should I care about
who that guy fucks,

705
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,459
or that guy fucks, or that
guy fucks, or that guy fucks,

706
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,628
it's all bullshit.

707
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,796
- Yeah, I agree.

708
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:40,802
- Good, so then what
are you afraid of?

709
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,740
- Nothing.

710
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:58,487
- You know there's a
community of people out there

711
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:03,759
who love you and
want you to be happy

712
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:08,163
and we want you to find love.

713
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,467
- You know, I could do it.

714
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:21,209
I could-I could compromise if
it meant living a life with him.

715
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,346
- So then why don't you?

716
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:30,018
- Because you're either gay,
or you're a man of faith...

717
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,821
but apparently
you can't be both.

718
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,093
- Hey.
- Hi.

719
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:46,268
- You know, you can tell
her to stop talking.

720
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,703
That's what I do.

721
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,975
Waking me up.

722
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:56,378
Hi.

723
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,655
I heard about Chris's mom.

724
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,127
How are you doing?

725
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:15,397
- Eh...

726
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,999
- Come here.

727
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:33,348
- You make me feel like
a baby when you do that.

728
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,217
- Because you are one.

729
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,496
- No, no, no.
- Do one more with me.

730
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:24,299
- No, I'm good.
- Just one more, come on.

731
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,903
- No, really, I'm good.
- Fine.

732
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,541
- You are falling apart.

733
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:37,879
- Am I? I think I'm
finally letting loose.

734
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:39,981
- Well, you've been
letting loose for a while.

735
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,684
- Well, you need to loosen up.

736
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,500
What do we do now?

737
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,638
- Well I pass out because I have
to go be an editor in the morning.

738
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,542
- No, no, no, I mean
your body of work.

739
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:11,446
Those books on the shelf, they're
filled with your feelings

740
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,981
about this man.

741
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,083
He was your muse.

742
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:20,055
- I'll find a new one.

743
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,292
- I could be your muse.

744
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,128
I make a great muse.

745
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,198
- Yeah, you are.

746
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,641
- What?

747
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,710
- Nothing.

748
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:40,302
- Okay, okay,
no, okay, okay, okay.

749
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:43,538
- He's not here.

750
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,373
- It's not about him.

751
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:48,009
- You're attracted to me right?

752
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:50,445
- Of course, you're beautiful.

753
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:07,228
Hey come on, please don't be...

754
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,265
Don't let this
be awkward between us.

755
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:12,200
- Too late.

756
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,836
- Look, I have feelings for you.

757
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:18,807
And they are
complicated feelings.

758
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:20,709
We just can't have sex.

759
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:23,745
It'll mess it up.

760
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,915
- We both know what it's
like to love something

761
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:30,819
that doesn't love
us back, don't we?

762
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:38,059
- Ryan... come on.

763
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,661
- What?

764
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,997
- Come here, come on.

765
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:46,267
Come here.

766
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,253
- Do you still
believe in God, RJ?

767
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:11,026
Do you think that
He's here right now?

768
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,906
Because I'm starting to
see our Heavenly Father...

769
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:31,646
like I see the Prophet
or the other leaders, as...

770
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:33,982
flawed men.

771
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,720
I don't want to
see Him like that.

772
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:44,292
I want to know that He's
here, and that He loves me.

773
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:50,398
- Do you feel loved right now?

774
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,471
- In this moment, I do.

775
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,277
- Then maybe He is.

776
01:08:12,189 --> 01:08:14,456
- I have to admit...

777
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:18,460
I didn't want you and Chris
to work out.

778
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:19,594
- I know that.

779
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,998
- I just didn't want
to lose what we have.

780
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,471
- I am not what you want,
and I think you know that.

781
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:35,710
- I looked at you guys,
and I thought to myself,

782
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,617
"I want that... I want that.

783
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,087
Or something like that."

784
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:48,022
- You can have it.

785
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:53,428
- I want a family some day, RJ.

786
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,630
I want a Temple wedding.

787
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,133
I don't want to be told that
I'm going to be banished

788
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:00,702
to the outer darkness
for wanting that.

789
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,106
I have been to the dark places,

790
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,842
and I had to pull myself out.

791
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:12,947
I don't want to go back there.

792
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:36,371
- You can have all of that,
but not if you're gone.

793
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,161
- What do we do now?

794
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,339
- We call your
mission companion.

795
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:13,975
- No, no we don't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

796
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:19,747
- Come on is there a way to
get a hold of Elder Petersen?

797
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,251
- Maybe.

798
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:26,521
- Then let's call him.

799
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:30,358
- It's probably not even
his number any more.

800
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,860
Besides he wouldn't
pick up, he's probably

801
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,463
out with his friends
or something.

802
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:38,199
At BYU, it's like 2 am.

803
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:43,605
- Okay, well maybe not, but
still he wouldn't pick up.

804
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:47,075
- Well then it doesn't matter.

805
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:49,143
- He might be angry with me.

806
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:50,211
- Why?

807
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:56,251
- He went home for what we did.

808
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:02,590
He's ashamed.

809
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:10,231
- He could fall in
love with another boy,

810
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:15,837
or worse, he could marry
some unsuspecting girl.

811
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,139
- I've been drinking.

812
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:20,441
- That'll only help.

813
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:23,411
- I'll call him some other time.

814
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,747
- No, no, tonight, we're
gonna call him tonight.

815
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:28,750
- Chris never answered your
calls after your mission.

816
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:30,918
- Yeah, I didn't try hard enough.
- Well, he didn't let you.

817
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,921
- I could've tried harder.
- Don't fuck this up like I did.

818
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,256
- You didn't.

819
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,694
- Come on let me see your phone.

820
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:41,496
- It's probably dead.

821
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,236
- You're not going
to do it, come on.

822
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:50,305
- Just let me sort it out.

823
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:54,208
- His roommates are
probably out right now

824
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,810
soaking with their girlfriends.

825
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,278
- Gross.

826
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:04,585
- He's alone in his dorm,
and he wants you to call him.

827
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:05,953
- No, he doesn't.

828
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:12,960
- You know when you think
about someone you love,

829
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:16,831
it's usually because they're
thinking about you, too.

830
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,387
- Hello?

831
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,324
- It's Ryan.

832
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,229
I'm in Portland.

833
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,466
That's cool.

834
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,701
How did you know I'd be up?

835
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,436
- Just luck, I guess.

836
01:12:56,506 --> 01:13:01,008
It's nice to hear from you.

837
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,645
- It's so good to
hear your voice.

838
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:06,180
It's weird you'd called,

839
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,116
I've been thinking about you.

840
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:09,450
- You have?

841
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:13,821
- Yeah,
like all the flipping time.

842
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:21,062
- Are you alone?

843
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:25,266
Yeah, are you?

844
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,035
- Yeah, I am.

845
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:32,039
So, how have you been?

846
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,611
- Good.

847
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:43,451
I miss you.

848
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:45,753
- I miss you, too.

849
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:49,257
- Really?
- Yeah.

850
01:13:52,562 --> 01:13:55,029
- I wish I could see your face.

851
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:01,169
- Well maybe we could
make that happen.

852
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:04,172
- Really?
- Yeah.

853
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:13,114
- I remember how you
used to look at me.

854
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:16,451
- Like you were the only
person in the world?

855
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,352
- Yeah.

856
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:20,755
- It's because that's all I saw.

857
01:14:24,194 --> 01:14:26,594
I love you.

858
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,834
- I love you, too.

859
01:14:34,771 --> 01:14:37,505
So much.

860
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:45,980
- I'm coming home,
I think it's time.

861
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,109
- President, may I sit?

862
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,591
- Yes, brother Merrill.

863
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:34,655
Let me first say that
I am praying for you.

864
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:37,258
I've been speaking with
our Heavenly Father,

865
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,960
and He loves you.

866
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:42,863
Debbie was dear to
me and to Francis.

867
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:45,566
How are Chelsea, and Greg,
Chris and Kaylee?

868
01:16:47,136 --> 01:16:51,205
- Well Chelsea is taking
it pretty hard, as is Greg.

869
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:55,876
Kaylee, we tell her
that Deedee has gone on

870
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:59,847
to her eternal family, but
you know, she's a child.

871
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:03,818
Chris has been a rock.

872
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,420
And he's actually a
big part of the reason

873
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:08,522
I'm here today.

874
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:10,291
- Oh?

875
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:14,629
- He suffered from same-sex
attraction for many years.

876
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:19,133
I tried, I did everything
I could to help him,

877
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,936
but I've stopped that now.

878
01:17:21,938 --> 01:17:25,072
- It's a very difficult
situation.

879
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:29,343
- I realized that he
is fine the way he is.

880
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:32,380
There's no need
for him to change.

881
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,582
- Brother Merrill,

882
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:38,452
you know that Lucifer will
try every trick to mislead us.

883
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,923
- You continue to
teach me to be open

884
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:46,694
to the promptings of the
spirit, and I feel my heart

885
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:49,764
softening towards Chris
and the many faithful

886
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:51,132
who are like him.

887
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:59,473
Where's our spirituality?

888
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:02,810
Where's our response
to the love of God?

889
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:09,016
This doesn't feel like
love, making people choose...

890
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,921
separating ourselves
from them for eternity.

891
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:21,762
Have you seen what's
happening in the world?

892
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:27,234
People are being killed,
beaten, discriminated against

893
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:32,073
every day, my son among them.

894
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:33,274
- I understand,

895
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:37,745
brother Merrill, but I
have heard from the Lord...

896
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:41,849
is that we have to proceed
as we already have.

897
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:45,953
- Well, I, too, have talked
to our Heavenly Father.

898
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:47,503
Oh, have you?

899
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:52,193
Yes and He told me that
we, the apostles, and...

900
01:18:54,163 --> 01:18:57,431
the Quorum must continue
to discuss this matter.

901
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:08,743
- Alright, son, you'll
have your meeting.

902
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:14,281
In the meantime,
Noah, get some rest.

903
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:15,850
You're going through
much more now

904
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:17,618
than you may realize.

905
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:22,790
- Thank you, but I really
need to work right now.

906
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:25,960
- I understand.

907
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:27,628
Let us pray.

908
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,963
- Of course.

909
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:37,238
- Dear Heavenly Father,
we thank you for the friendships

910
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:45,379
that support us in difficult times...
when we lose family

911
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:49,250
until we see them
again in eternal life,

912
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:50,818
it is very hard.

913
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:56,490
- Okay. Do you remember which
order these go in?

914
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:57,525
- Yeah.

915
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,095
- Alright, put 'em
in order for me.

916
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:12,206
Very good, good job.

917
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:17,244
So can you tell me where
Grandma is, do you remember?

918
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:20,781
Very good, that's the spirit world.
That's paradise.

919
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:22,583
That's where she's
waiting for all of us.

920
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,919
- Here?
- Yep, right there.

921
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:28,022
- Yeah, right there,
and one day, we will all

922
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:30,858
be together right here.

923
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:34,361
So it'll be you, and me, and
Mommy's going to be there,

924
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:38,566
and your Grandma, and we
will all be together forever.

925
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:40,501
- RJ, too?

926
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:46,774
- Yeah, of course,
he'll be there.

927
01:20:50,213 --> 01:20:52,613
Of course, he'll be there, baby.

928
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,918
Oh, your Mommy's going to
be here in a few minutes.

929
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,720
Do you want to go
outside and wait for her?

930
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:01,222
See if we can see her drive up?

931
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

932
01:21:45,301 --> 01:21:47,902
- You promise you're not mad
that I'm not going to BYU?

933
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:49,336
- I'm not mad.

934
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:51,972
This makes so more sense.

935
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:54,675
You won't have to
disrupt Kaylee's life.

936
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:57,878
This place is beautiful.

937
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,313
- Yeah.

938
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:01,181
It's the right thing.

939
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:09,456
I was thinking about our
dinner with the Smiths,

940
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:12,159
and how much I wished your
mom could have been there

941
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:14,261
for that.

942
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:23,137
It had a life marker
feel about it.

943
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:32,146
It's inspired me to
bring some matters up

944
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:34,148
before the Quorum.

945
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:37,484
I'm going to broach the
subject of the new policy

946
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:40,955
and also same-sex
marriage in the Church.

947
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,095
What do you think about that?

948
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:56,870
- I don't think I ever told
you this, but... while I was

949
01:22:56,872 --> 01:23:02,476
in therapy... they told
me time and again,

950
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:05,980
you can choose God or
you can choose love.

951
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:10,784
Well, to me, they're
one in the same.

952
01:23:10,786 --> 01:23:14,421
My own daughter knows
that, a child knows that.

953
01:23:17,626 --> 01:23:20,561
I'm not going to let
anyone tell me who I can

954
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:25,199
and can't be with... and I'm
not going to let anyone...

955
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:28,435
define those choices
for me either.

956
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:38,946
This meeting with the
President, with the Quorum...

957
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:45,652
thank you, but I hope you're
not doing it just for me.

958
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:49,390
I hope you're doing
it because you know

959
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:51,992
it's the right thing to do.

960
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:58,265
- As a member of the
Quorum, I'm limited.

961
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:02,136
I'm one voice in that
room, but I'm going to have

962
01:24:02,138 --> 01:24:04,071
your mom with me.

963
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:14,481
You know... when I saw
you and RJ together,

964
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:18,318
when he had his panic attack,
and you ran after him...

965
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,388
reassured him, talked
him through it.

966
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:26,760
That reminded me so
much of your mom and I,

967
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:29,096
and how we cared for each other.

968
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:31,398
That's love.

969
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,268
I saw that with you.

970
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:40,474
It's like a dream...

971
01:24:40,476 --> 01:24:44,011
this life,
it only lasts so long.

972
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,386
I love you, son.

973
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,522
- I love you, too, Dad.

974
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:00,828
- God, I miss her.

975
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:03,764
- Me too.

976
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:09,736
* His love shall light my way *

977
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:14,274
* Through darkness
and through doubt *

978
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:18,212
* Imprisoned by uncertainty *

979
01:25:19,048 --> 01:25:22,850
* His love has brought me out *

980
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:57,110
- Hey.
- Hi.

981
01:26:57,112 --> 01:26:58,645
- How long have you been here?

982
01:26:58,647 --> 01:27:00,681
- Three and a half hours.

983
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:02,482
- I'm so sorry.

984
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:03,550
- It's okay.

985
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:06,553
- You got into law school.

986
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,289
- I did.

987
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:16,563
- Congratulations.
- Thank you... Oh, okay.

988
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:58,365
- Have you had time... to think?

989
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:15,549
You don't have to
be strong for me.

990
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:49,750
- I never got to say goodbye.

991
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:54,821
She was so good.

992
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:43,056
- Hi, you've reached
the voice-mail box of Christopher Merrill.

993
01:32:43,058 --> 01:32:46,593
- Chris, as a member of
the Quorum of the Twelve,

994
01:32:46,595 --> 01:32:49,563
I have to tell you that
I cannot support you,

995
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:53,700
but as your father,
you have my blessing.

996
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:56,536
You don't need it,
but you have it.

997
01:33:09,785 --> 01:33:12,152
- Hey, hey, you have time.

998
01:33:12,154 --> 01:33:13,820
You're not going to
miss your flight.

999
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:16,122
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1000
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:25,532
What's in going to be like
when you start school?

1001
01:33:25,534 --> 01:33:28,101
- Well, you know there's
going to be breaks every now

1002
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:33,940
and then, and it's
only three years.

1003
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:37,444
- A lot can happen
in three years.

1004
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:39,479
- Yeah.

1005
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:40,747
- I just feel like
you're going to leave,

1006
01:33:40,749 --> 01:33:43,216
and everything's
going to be the same.

1007
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:44,884
- RJ, I know why
you feel that way.

1008
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:47,087
- I prayed this morning.

1009
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:54,327
I prayed for Heavenly
Father to give me strength.

1010
01:33:54,329 --> 01:33:58,164
I prayed for strength
to let us go,

1011
01:33:59,368 --> 01:34:01,735
so that you could attend to
matters in your own life,

1012
01:34:01,737 --> 01:34:03,870
and I could do the same.

1013
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:09,909
I know that the Church
has betrayed us...

1014
01:34:11,213 --> 01:34:19,185
and it's excluded us, and
it's been... heart breaking...

1015
01:34:19,187 --> 01:34:20,987
but when you're
wrapped up in it,

1016
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,822
I can't live without it.

1017
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:35,769
- I know it's been really
crazy the last couple

1018
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:39,506
of weeks, and for my part,
I apologize for that...

1019
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:46,079
but if it's taught me anything,

1020
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:49,015
it's that life is way too short.

1021
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:54,454
For the first time in my
life, I know what I want

1022
01:34:54,456 --> 01:34:55,955
and who I want.

1023
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,426
I want you.

1024
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:08,068
And Kaylee, and the Church,
I want it all...

1025
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,071
because we deserve it.

1026
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:13,440
- I want it all, too.

1027
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:15,809
I want everything.

1028
01:35:15,811 --> 01:35:19,679
It belongs to us as much as
it belongs to anyone else...

1029
01:35:21,283 --> 01:35:25,819
and nobody can tell us
what our options are...

1030
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:28,121
and I don't want to
fuck around anymore.

1031
01:35:35,197 --> 01:35:40,667
- Well, I had this whole
other thing planned.

1032
01:35:48,944 --> 01:35:52,378
I called your dad recently...

1033
01:35:54,549 --> 01:35:59,719
and the reason I called him was to
ask his permission to marry his son.

1034
01:36:24,746 --> 01:36:26,412
Will you marry me?

1035
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:34,621
Yes...

1036
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,656
I love you.

1037
01:36:37,759 --> 01:36:39,526
- I love you so much.

1038
01:36:48,036 --> 01:36:50,837
I will never leave you again.

1039
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:07,120
You need some tissue?

1040
01:37:07,122 --> 01:37:08,621
- No, no I'm okay.

1041
01:37:10,559 --> 01:37:13,059
- I have a plane to catch.

1042
01:37:13,061 --> 01:37:15,562
- You said you would never leave.
- Just this once.

1043
01:37:15,564 --> 01:37:17,397
- Okay.
- Okay.

1044
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:28,842
- Our dear Heavenly Father,
we're so very grateful

1045
01:37:28,844 --> 01:37:33,479
for this blessed day, to be
here, with these two young men.

1046
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:36,182
We pray that thy
spirit will be with us,

1047
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:39,052
and it will bless them
and strengthen them

1048
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:41,588
as they endure life's
challenges together.

1049
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:44,157
We pray that all will be
enriched by this experience

1050
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:45,625
as we leave today,

1051
01:37:45,627 --> 01:37:48,862
and that we will always
remember to treat thy children

1052
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:53,132
with the utmost of love,
kindness, and patience,

1053
01:37:53,134 --> 01:37:55,735
and we ask these things
humbly in the name of thy Son,

1054
01:37:55,737 --> 01:37:57,637
Jesus Christ, Amen.

1055
01:37:57,639 --> 01:37:59,272
- Amen.

1056
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:05,245
- And now the rings.

1057
01:38:25,367 --> 01:38:29,002
Brethren, do you take
one another by the hand

1058
01:38:30,472 --> 01:38:34,173
and receive each other to
be your lawful and wedded

1059
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:37,310
husband for time
and all eternity,

1060
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:43,049
and this you do in the
presence of God, angels,

1061
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:49,622
and these witnesses of your
own free will and choice?

1062
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:51,291
- Yes.

1063
01:38:51,793 --> 01:38:53,159
- Yes.

1064
01:38:54,362 --> 01:38:58,665
- By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husbands.

1065
01:39:29,864 --> 01:39:37,603
- My name is RJ Smith, and I
married Chris, the love of my life...

1066
01:39:37,605 --> 01:39:41,374
in December of 2016,
in Portland, Oregon,

1067
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:46,779
our families were both there,

1068
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:49,482
including my stepdaughter
Kaylee.

1069
01:39:52,287 --> 01:39:55,088
I soon moved to
Salt Lake with them.

1070
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:59,092
I got a job as an
adjunct professor

1071
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:05,798
at the University of Utah,
and I finished my new book.

1072
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:12,872
I finally found a way to join the
two opposing sides of myself.

1073
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:23,216
My first day in our home,
we knelt down and prayed.

1074
01:40:26,888 --> 01:40:31,758
Chris said to me softly,
"This is it."

1075
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:36,295
This is what we have.

1076
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:42,702
"This is what we've
been fighting for."

1077
01:40:43,905 --> 01:40:49,142
He said it was all worth it...
and he was right.
