进来吧

{\rEng}20 minutes and we were gonna start looking for you.

8
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,020
是啊！外面状况的确很糟！
{\rEng}Yeah. It's really something out there.

00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,200

13
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,750
你刚刚说什么？
{\rEng}What was that you were you saying?

14
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,550
你常会听到她整夜诵经“哦吗咪吧比轰”
{\rEng}You used to hear her chant all night long. Om mahneypod me om.

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,130
- 哦吗咪吧比轰 - 对植物诵经吗？
{\rEng}- Om mahneypod me om. - Over the plants?

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,550
她双手并拢在种子上面轻拂，一诵经就一小时以上
{\rEng}She'd cup her hands over those seeds and chant by the hour.

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,760
她种出你所看过最美丽的鞣桉，老兄
{\rEng}She grew the most beautiful wandoos you ever saw, man.

18
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,930
雷西城里都是顶级的东西
{\rEng}Primo stuff. Resin city.

19
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,980
让开
{\rEng}Stand clear.

20
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,990
指挥官正担心着你们呢，路况一定很糟糕吧
{\rEng}The commander's been worried about you. The roads must be a bear.

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,320
- 那来的路？- 能见度太差
{\rEng}- What roads? - Visibility.

22
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,160
能见度太差？胡扯，你们这些家伙6个月来从不准时
{\rEng}Visibility? Bullshit. You guys haven't been on time for the last six months.

23
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,990
- 我在已经在日志里帮你们签到了 - 是啊，你真是好人，贝文
{\rEng}- I wrote you guys up in the logbook. - Yeah. You're a prince, Bevan.

24
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,830
晚安，两位！
{\rEng}Good night, gentlemen!

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,760
所以，用起来感觉就像法属西印度群岛的音乐，是吗？
{\rEng}So, that was like sinsemilia, right?

26
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,590
法属西印度群岛的音乐，这草搞的泰国烟尝起来都没味道
{\rEng}Sinsemilla. This grass made Thai stick taste like oregano.

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,760
安排好你自己，老兄
{\rEng}Lay you out flat, man.

28
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,020
- 长官，红灯没熄 - 那一个位置？
{\rEng}- Got a red light, sir. - What on?

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,190
8号，导弹弹头警报
{\rEng}Number eight. Warhead alarm.

30
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,560
用你的指头敲一敲
{\rEng}Give it a thump with your finger.

31
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,230
警报重新设定
{\rEng}Alarm reset.

32
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,870
天鸟，这是抛踢发布红色-A级警报
{\rEng}Skybird, this is Dropkick with a Red dash Alpha message in two parts.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,040

00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,180
我收到一个对的命令，准备确认
{\rEng}I have a valid message. Stand by to authenticate.

40
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,770
我也同意进行确认，长官

{\rEng}- All right. Let's do it. Insert launch key. - Stand by.

47
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,890
听我的口令...旋转发射钥匙
{\rEng}On my mark... rotate launch key to Set.

48
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,600
3 ... 2 ... 1 ...

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
- 转 - 倒数计时50秒
{\rEng}- Mark. - Tminus 50.

50
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,860

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,790
- 长官？- 倒数计时40秒
{\rEng}- Sir? - Tminus 40.

52
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,360
- 发射备便 - 一号备便，二号备便
{\rEng}- Enable missiles. - Number one enabled. Two enabled.

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,780
- 三号备便 - 找人来接这该死的电话！
{\rEng}- Three enabled. - Get somebody on the goddamn phone.

54
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,130
7...8...
{\rEng}Seven... eight...

55
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,130
9...
{\rEng}Nine...

56
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,550
10枚导弹全都备便发射
{\rEng}Ten. All missiles enabled.

57
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,890
- 给我接空军作战司令部 - 那不是正确的程序
{\rEng}- Get me Wing Command Post. Direct line. - That's not the correct procedure.

58
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,380
- 联系战略空军司令部 - 那违反程序
{\rEng}- Try SAC Headquarters on the HF. - That's not the procedure.

59
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,810
在我杀死2000万人之前，我要有人来接这该死的电话！
{\rEng}I want somebody on the goddamn phone before I kill 20 million people.

60
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,730
倒数计时20秒
{\rEng}T minus 20.

61
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,770
什么也没有！他们可能已经被干掉了！
{\rEng}I got nothin' here! They might have been knocked out already.

62
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,480
对！
{\rEng}Right.

63
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,810
听我的口令，转动发射钥匙
{\rEng}On my mark, rotate launch keys to Launch.

64
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,190
收到！准备发射！
{\rEng}Roger. Ready to go to Launch.

65
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,650
- 14... - 13...12...
{\rEng}- Fourteen... - Thirteen... twelve...

66
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,110
11...
{\rEng}Eleven...

67
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,620
7...6...
{\rEng}Seven... six...

68
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,070
- 5... - 长官！我们有发射命令！
{\rEng}- Five... - Sir, we have a launch order.

69
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,330
- 3...2... - 长官！把你的手放在钥匙上！
{\rEng}- Three... two... - Put your hand on the key, sir.

70
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,340
1...发射！
{\rEng}One... Launch!

71
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,500
- 长官！我们得发射！转动你的钥匙！- 对不起！非常抱歉！
{\rEng}- Sir, we are at launch! Turn your key! - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

72
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,260
长官！转动你的钥匙！
{\rEng}Turn your key, sir!

73
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,760
他们没问题，尽管把门打开
{\rEng}They're cleared. Go ahead and open it up.

74
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,850
- 你好！我是帕特·希利 - 我是莱尔·沃森，这是亚瑟·卡伯特
{\rEng}- Hello. I'm Pat Healy. - I'm Lyle Watson. This is Arthur Cabot.

75
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,640
我是帕特·希利，麦崔克博士的助手 我已经为你们办了通行证
{\rEng}I'm Pat Healy, Dr McKittrick's assistant. I've got some passes for you here.

76
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,640
在你们来之前，我们已经安排了一个会议
{\rEng}We had scheduled a meeting pending your arrival.

77
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,480
如果你们有任何问题，尽量问我
{\rEng}If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

78
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,730
我将很高兴替你们效劳
{\rEng}I'd be happy to fill you in if there's any way I can.

79
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,400
他们到了
{\rEng}They're here.

80
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,110
好
{\rEng}Good.

81
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,730
我们走
{\rEng}Let's go.

82
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,940
卡伯特和沃森单独前来，没有参议员 也没有国会议员
{\rEng}Cabot and Watson came alone. No senators. No congressmen.

83
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,450
我倒希望他们带些参议员来，这样 才能告诉他们这里在做什么
{\rEng}I wish they'd brought a few senators. I'd like to tell 'em what's going on here.

84
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,250
约翰！拜托！现在不要那么做！
{\rEng}John, please! Don't start that right away.

85
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,000
我有和他们通电话，他们已经平静下来了
{\rEng}I had them on the phone and they're calmed down.

86
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,330
嗯，我们确信这些人完全不知道 这只是一次测试吗？
{\rEng}Well, are we positive that these men had no way of knowing this was only a test?

87
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,130
看在老天爷面上，莱尔！这些鸟事 我们还要讨论多少次？
{\rEng}Lyle, for God's sakes! How many times are we gonna go through this?

88
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,670
- 它完全没有区别 - 我已经跟这些人谈过了
{\rEng}- It doesn't make any difference. - I've spoken to these men.

89
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,130
他们全都相信它是真的
{\rEng}They all believed it was the real deal.

90
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,020
注意，我们的飞机一小时内就要起飞
{\rEng}Look, we gotta be on a plane in less than an hour.

91
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,300
我得对总统解释，为什么有22%的导弹官
{\rEng}I have to explain to the president why 22% of his missile commanders

92
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,180
不愿意发射导弹，我该说什么？22%还算好？
{\rEng}failed to launch their missiles. What am I supposed to say? 22% isn't so bad?

93
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,020
总统知道我对麾下的人负完全责任
{\rEng}The president knows that I am fully responsible for the men in my command.

94
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,070
我已经安排了他们重做心理评估
{\rEng}I've ordered a re-evaluation of our psychological screening procedure.

95
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,570
稍等一下！对不起！将军！
{\rEng}Wait a minute. Excuse me, General.

96
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,780
我们不能把这些人带着精神病医师的胡说！
{\rEng}We can't ask these men to go back to the president

97
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,200
踢回到总统那儿，让总统处理，你不可能从那些报告看出人的反应！
{\rEng}with a lot of headshrinker horseshit! You can't screen out human response!

98
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,120
那些人知道转动钥匙会发生什么事 只不过有些人下不了手！
{\rEng}Those men know what it means to turn the keys, and some are just not up to it!

99
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,960
现在看清楚！就是那么简单！
{\rEng}Now, it's as simple as that!

100
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,380
我想我们应该把人的因素抽离 不依靠人发射
{\rEng}I think we oughta take the men out of the loop.

101
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,090
- 麦崔克先生，你离谱了，先生 - 我那有离谱？
{\rEng}- Mr McKittrick, you're out of line, sir. - Why am I out of line?

102
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,760
对不起！
{\rEng}Excuse me!

103
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,500
对不起！我不理解！把人的因素抽离？
{\rEng}I'm sorry. I don't understand. Take them out of the loop?

104
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,100
各位！这些导弹发射井早在你们看伍迪杜迪儿童秀之前 就有导弹官驻守了
{\rEng}Gentlemen! We've had men in these silos since before any of you were watching Howdy Doody.

105
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,100
就我而言，我在夜里就睡得很香，因为我知道有那些小伙子守在那里
{\rEng}For myself, I sleep pretty well at night knowing those boys are down there.

106
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,360
将军，我们知道他们都是优秀的人，但是在核战中我们承受不起
{\rEng}General, we know they're fine men, but in a nuclear war we can't afford

107
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,240
让导弹像死火山一样，静静地躺在发射井里
{\rEng}to have missiles lying dormant in those silos

108
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,190
只因为当电脑叫他们发射时，那些人不愿转动钥匙！
{\rEng}because those men refuse to turn the keys when the computers tell 'em to!

109
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,570
你是说当总统命令他们的时候
{\rEng}You mean when the president orders them to.

110
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,410
总统或许会依照电脑战争计划行动，那是事实！
{\rEng}The president will probably follow the computer war plan. That's a fact!

111
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,290
我想参谋总长会愿意加入一些意见
{\rEng}I imagine the Joint Chiefs will have some input.

112
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,040
- 你他妈简直是聋子 - 那么，该死...
{\rEng}- You're damn tootin'. - Well, hell...

113
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,660
假如对方突袭的话，我们完全没有时间反应
{\rEng}In a surprise attack, there's no time.

114
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,330
预警到导弹爆炸只有23分钟
{\rEng}23 minutes from warning to impact.

115
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,630
- 如果是潜射导弹，预警时间只有6分钟 - 仅仅6分钟
{\rEng}- Six minutes if it's sub-launched. - Six minutes.

116
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,590
就那么一点时间给总统作决定
{\rEng}That's barely enough time for the president to make a decision.

117
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,640
一旦他下了决定，电脑应该接管
{\rEng}Once he makes the decision, the computer should take over.

118
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,510
现在，两位，我知道你们在赶飞机
{\rEng}Now, sir, I know that you've got a plane waiting for you,

119
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,170
但是如果可以的话，我想展示给你们看
{\rEng}but if you could indulge me, I'd like to show you something.

120
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,970
这些电脑可以处理世界上所有状况的实时信息
{\rEng}These computers give instant access to the state of the world.

121
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,560
军队的移防，苏联的导弹测试，天气变化的模式
{\rEng}Troop movements, Soviet missile tests, weather patterns.

122
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,530
这些信息全部进到这个房间，然后进入华普电脑
{\rEng}It all flows into this room, and then into the WOPR computer.

123
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,190
- 华普？那是什么？- 实时反应战争行动计划
{\rEng}- WOPR? What is that? - War Operation Plan Response.

124
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,150
这是黎克特先生
{\rEng}This is Mr Richter.

125
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,120
保罗，你能向这些先生介绍华普的情况吗？
{\rEng}Paul, would you like to tell these gentlemen about the WOPR?

126
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,790
嗯，华普专门在研究第三次世界大战
{\rEng}Well, the WOPR spends all its time thinking about World War Ill.

127
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,130
一天24小时，一年365天，它不停地执行战争游戏
{\rEng}24 hours a day, 365 days a year, it plays an endless series of war games

128
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,840
使用所有搜集到的世界各国情报
{\rEng}using all available information on the state of the world.

129
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,830
华普已经把第三次世界大战当作游戏，打了一阵子
{\rEng}The WOPR has already fought World War Ill, as a game,

130
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,010
打了一次又一次
{\rEng}time and time again.

131
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,340
它预估苏联对我们的反应会有什么回应
{\rEng}It estimates Soviet responses to our responses

132
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,760
以及对他们的回应，等等...
{\rEng}to their responses, and so on.

133
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,470
损害估计、计算伤亡
{\rEng}Estimates damage. Counts the dead.

134
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,360
然后它想办法增加分数...
{\rEng}Then it looks for ways to improve its score...

135
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,940
重点是关键决定
{\rEng}The point is that the key decisions

136
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,190
每种选项都已经被华普考虑过了
{\rEng}of every option have already been made by the WOPR.

137
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,980
所以这些万亿美元的设备只是因为怜悯那些家伙
{\rEng}So all this trillion-dollar hardware is really at the mercy

138
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,490
不然，早就可以取代那些导弹官了？
{\rEng}of those men with the little brass keys?

139
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,360
完全正确，那些家伙唯一的问题是，他们是人类
{\rEng}That's exactly right. Whose only problem is that they're human beings.

140
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,280
但是在30天内，我们就能用电子转换器取代那些人
{\rEng}But in 30 days we could put in electronic relays. Get the men out of the loop.

141
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,040
先生们...
{\rEng}Gentlemen...

142
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,830
我不相信一堆微芯片能管用，除非把它扔了
{\rEng}I wouldn't trust this overgrown pile of microchips further than I could throw it.

143
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,580
我不知道你是否要把我们的国家安全维系在一些...硅芯片...上
{\rEng}I don't know if you wanna trust the safety of our country to some... silicon diode...

144
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,330
没人说要把国家安全交给一台机器
{\rEng}Nobody is talking about entrusting the safety of the nation

145
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,510
看在老天爷面上！
{\rEng}to a machine, for God's sake!

146
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,670
我们仍然控制着系统，但这里拥有所有导弹的控制权
{\rEng}We'll keep control, but here at the top where it belongs.

147
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,180
好了，先生们
{\rEng}All right, gentlemen.

148
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,470
我想我会向总统推荐麦崔克的办法
{\rEng}I think I'm going to recommend McKittrick's idea to the president.

149
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,090
而这件事我会给你个答案的
{\rEng}And I'll get back to you on this.

150
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,980
你绝不会后悔的
{\rEng}You won't regret this.

151
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,330
好，你的炸薯条和可乐，对吗？
{\rEng}OK. You had fries and a Coke, right?

152
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,970
该死！
{\rEng}Damn!

153
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,470
- 嗨，大卫！- 嗨，豪伊！
{\rEng}- Hi, David! - Hi, Howie!

154
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,600

{\rEng}- How's it going? - Pretty good.

155
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,980
- 你想继续玩吗？我得走了 - 当然！
{\rEng}- You wanna take this over? I gotta go. - Sure!

156
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,150
- 打吧！- 谢啦！
{\rEng}- Go ahead. - Thanks!

157
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,860
- 再见，大卫！- 再见！
{\rEng}- Bye, David! - Bye!

158
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,330
好！第二个问题
{\rEng}All right. Question number two.

159
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:33,330
种子在被种植之前，要放在在水里发芽...为什么？
{\rEng}Seeds that are germinated in water before they are planted will... what?

160
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,790
- 罗伯特？- 使根生长？
{\rEng}- Robert? - Sprout roots?

161
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,630
啊！大卫！
{\rEng}Ah! David!

162
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,220
很高兴你加入我们，噢，大卫！我有小礼物给你
{\rEng}Nice of you to join us. Oh, David. I have a little present for you.

163
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,350
第4个问题，在科学历史上
{\rEng}Question number four. In the history of science,

164
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,060
偶尔会出现新奇和革新的概念
{\rEng}novel and innovative concepts occasionally arise

165
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,680
是因为突然有非主流想法的启发
{\rEng}from sudden left-field inspiration.

166
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,560
麦克小姐...
{\rEng}Miss Mack...

167
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,060
你能告诉我们第4个问题你的答案吗？
{\rEng}Could you tell us your answer to question number four?

168
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,700
为什么氮根瘤依附着植物的根吗？
{\rEng}Why do nitrogen nodules cling to the roots of plants?

169
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,370
因为爱？
{\rEng}Love?

170
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,950
珍妮弗，关于氮根瘤，你了解一些我们不知道的吗？
{\rEng}Jennifer, what do you know about nitrogen nodules that we don't?

171
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,620
一些只能你自己独享的猥亵东西？
{\rEng}Some bit of salacious info to which you alone are privy?

172
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,250
- 没有 - 我明白了
{\rEng}- No. - I see.

173
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,670
不对，你不知道正确的答案...共生
{\rEng}No, you didn't know the correct answer - symbiosis.

174
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,220
因为你上课不专心
{\rEng}Because you don't pay attention in class.

175
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,890
- 谢谢 - 别客气
{\rEng}- Thank you. - You're welcome.

176
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,260
好像在下一个无性生殖的问题上，我们有许多混淆的地方
{\rEng}There seems to be a lot of confusion on this next question - asexual reproduction.

177
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,600
谁能告诉我
{\rEng}Could someone tell me, please

178
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,100
谁首先提出了无性生殖的概念？
{\rEng}who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex?

179
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,990
- 麦克小姐！- 是？
{\rEng}- Miss Mack! - Yes?

180
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,740
什么事如此有趣？
{\rEng}What is so amusing?

181
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,160
什么？
{\rEng}What?

182
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,000
好，莱特曼
{\rEng}All right, Lightman.

183
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,330
或许你能告诉我们，谁首先提出了无性生殖的概念
{\rEng}Maybe you can tell us who first suggested the idea of reproduction without sex.

184
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,830
你的妻子吗？
{\rEng}Your wife?

185
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,250
出去！莱特曼！出去！
{\rEng}Get out, Lightman! Get out!

186
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,430
利格特先生要我跟凯斯勒先生检讨态度问题
{\rEng}Mr Ligget wants me to discuss my attitude problem with Mr Kessler.

187
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,930
我想凯斯勒先生对你的态度问题已经很烦了
{\rEng}I think Mr Kessler's getting tired of your attitude problem.

188
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,690
我也是
{\rEng}Me, too.

189
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,920

{\rEng}- So you got an F on that test today, too? - Yep.

199
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,500
我想我们两个都得暑修了

200
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,540
- 我不会 - 为什么不？你得补上生物学
{\rEng}- Not me. - Why not? You have to make up biology.

201
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,620
- 我想不会 - 为什么不？
{\rEng}- I don't think so. - Why not?

{\rEng}- Why not? Come on! Tell me. Why not? - Make a left.

203
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,590
不如你来我家，我会秀给你看
{\rEng}Why don't you come up to my house and I'll show you?

204
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,760
你要秀什么给我看？
{\rEng}What are you gonna show me?

205
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,090

我的房间在楼上

没人会知道，你得了C！现在你不用去暑修了
{\rEng}Nobody can find out. You got a C! Now you won't go to summer school.

225
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,870
- 改回来 - 为什么？他们不能...
{\rEng}- Change it back. - Why? They can't...

226

00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,560
- 中间的那个吗？- 是的，女士
{\rEng}- The one in the middle? - Yes, ma'am.

599
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,140
噢，我的上帝！按错了！
{\rEng}Oh, my God! It's the wrong one!

600
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,860
是个玩笑！你没炸掉任何东西！看你做了些什么
{\rEng}It's a joke! You didn't blow up anything. Look what you did do.

601
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:10,860
"从伯明翰来的贵宾"
{\rEng}"Distinguished visitors from Birmingham."

602
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,720
就在上周我请纽泽西州长坐在这把椅子里
{\rEng}Last week I had the governor of New Jersey in this chair.

603
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:48,010
他说："托马斯上校，为什么我们在战备状况4？" 就像我们现在一样
{\rEng}He said, "Colonel Thomas, why are we at DEFCON 4?" as we are right now.

604
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,180
我们为什么在战备状况4？
{\rEng}Why are we at DEFCON 4?

605
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,230
那些苏联人看见我们的轰炸机紧急起飞，而且进入紧急状态
{\rEng}The Soviets saw our bombers scramble and went on alert.

606
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:58,260
我们跟他们说这只是一个演习，但是我们希望他们先降低战备状况
{\rEng}We told them it was just an exercise, but we want them to relax their posture first.

607
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,640
等等！等等！
{\rEng}Wait. Wait.

608
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,270
- 我帮你整理 - 噢，基督，又是一个旅行团
{\rEng}- Give me that. - Oh, Christ. Another tour group.

609
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,530
正是我们今天需要的，他们为什么不到该去的迪斯尼乐园呢？
{\rEng}Just what we need today. Why don't they go to Disneyland where they belong?

610
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,820
- 嗯，我想他们明天会去的 - 好，搞定了吗？噢，这里
{\rEng}- Well, I think they're going to tomorrow. - OK. All set? Oh, here.

611
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,030
那是个百万分之一的机会
{\rEng}It was a one-in-a-million shot.

612
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,000
在我们桑尼维尔的分部，有一条对外开放的线路
{\rEng}There was an open line at our division in Sunnyvale.

613
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,160
这是电话公司搞砸的！
{\rEng}The phone company screwed up!

614
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,290
- 约翰，约翰‧麦崔克，乔治威根 - 你好吗？
{\rEng}- John. John McKittrick, George Wigan. - How are you?

615
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,910
乔治跟FBI在一起，他把孩子带来了
{\rEng}George is with the FBl. He brought the kid in.

616
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:30,300
看来好像我们碰到了一个高中生的恶作剧
{\rEng}It looks like we've got a high-school prank on our hands.

617
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,250
保罗，怎么回事？
{\rEng}Paul, what happened?

618
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:37,130
那孩子使用系统原创者留下的密码，突入战争游戏系统
{\rEng}The kid broke into the war game using a password left by the original programmer.

619
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,840
- 一个密码？- 是的，长官
{\rEng}- A password? - Yes, sir.

620
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,010
我们甚至没人知道有这个密码
{\rEng}None of my team even knew it was there.

621
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,840
孩子声称他是在找一家玩具公司
{\rEng}Kid claims he was looking for a toy company.

622
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,220
太棒了！这里有人相信吗？
{\rEng}That's great! Anybody in here buy that one?

623
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,220
我们能找到密码而且删除它，但它能协助我们增加安全性
{\rEng}We can find the password and take it out, but it might help to beef up security.

624
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,350
噢！增加！啊？
{\rEng}Oh. Beef up, huh?

625
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,560
不如说搞砸吧？
{\rEng}How about screwed up?

626
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,360
我们做了所有防御措施，但是他再次突破进入系统
{\rEng}We did all that and he broke in again.

627
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,240
孩子说是你的电脑调用他的
{\rEng}Kid says your computer called him.

628
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,980
究竟他妈的是怎么回事，约翰？
{\rEng}What the hell is going on, John?

629
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,200
我叫醒总统！告诉他俄国人攻过来了！
{\rEng}I woke up the president. I told him we were under attack by the Russians.

630
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:13,490
你知道这让我看起来有多白痴吗？更别提将军了
{\rEng}You know what an idiot that makes me look? Not to mention the general.

631
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,780
我认为我们结论下得太草率了
{\rEng}I think we're being a little naive here.

632
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,960
绝对不可能有一个高中的烂货
{\rEng}There is no way a high-school punk

633
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,080
随便打打电话，就突破我们的系统
{\rEng}can put a dime in a telephone and break into our system.

634
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,540
他一定有同谋
{\rEng}He's got to be working with somebody else.

635
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,500
他符合这种人的特质，聪明，但是个后进生
{\rEng}He fits the profile perfectly. He's intelligent, but an underachiever.

636
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,420
跟父母不亲，朋友也很少
{\rEng}Alienated from his parents. Has few friends.

637
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,040
这是苏联要招幕人员的典型
{\rEng}Classic case for recruitment by the Soviets.

638
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,880
这件事对我们国家表示着什么？
{\rEng}What does this say about the state of our country?

639
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:40,560
我是指，你有没有观察到，为什么像这样聪明的男孩
{\rEng}I mean, have you gotten any insight as to why a bright boy like this

640
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,010
会危及数百万人的生命？
{\rEng}would jeopardise the lives of millions?

641
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,350
他说，他做这些事只是好玩
{\rEng}He says he does this sort of thing for fun.

642
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,850
他妈的，约翰，我要答案，而且我现在就要！
{\rEng}Dammit, John, I want some answers, and I want 'em now!

643
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,980
- 让我和这小混蛋谈谈 - 我不想再讨论了，做就对了！
{\rEng}- Let me talk to this little prick. - I don't wanna talk. Just do it!

644
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,740
保罗，跟我来
{\rEng}Come on, Paul.

645
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,450
他们属于谁？你知道吗？
{\rEng}Who do they belong to? Do you know?

646
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,950
什么？
{\rEng}What?

647
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,320
早安，长官
{\rEng}Good morning, sir.

648
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,570
- 莱特曼这孩子在哪里？- 在医务室，长官
{\rEng}- Where's the Lightman kid? - In the infirmary, sir.

649
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,790
你好，大卫，我是约翰‧麦崔克，我负责管理这电脑中心
{\rEng}Hello, David. John McKittrick. I run the computer facility here.

650
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,630
班长，这些不必要吧，用手铐？
{\rEng}Sergeant, these aren't necessary, the handcuffs?

651
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,220
是不必要，长官
{\rEng}No, sir.

652
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,600
嗯，大卫，我们有打电话给你的父母
{\rEng}Well, David, we called your parents.

653
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,050
我们告诉他们一切都很好
{\rEng}We told them everything's fine.

654
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,050
没有任何指控留下纪录...暂时没有
{\rEng}No charges have been filed... yet.

655
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,930
但是我想我们要花一点时间，来处理这里发生的一些事情
{\rEng}But I think we are gonna need a little time to sort things out here.

656
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,900
多久时间？
{\rEng}How much time?

657
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:49,390
嗯，那取决于你的合作程度
{\rEng}Well, that depends on how willing you are to cooperate.

658
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,600
噢，当然
{\rEng}Oh, of course.

659
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:57,190
班长，能请你告诉值日官，我要和大卫一起散个步吗？
{\rEng}Sergeant, would you tell the OD I'm gonna take David for a little walk?

660
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,990
我们去我的办公室吧，那里会更舒适一点
{\rEng}Let's go down to my office. We'll be more comfortable there.

661
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,160
走吧
{\rEng}Go ahead.

662
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,790
你与史蒂芬·法肯一起工作过吗？
{\rEng}You used to work with Stephen Falken?

663
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,410
我从他的助手开始做起，你怎么知道的？
{\rEng}I started as his assistant. How d'you know?

664
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,910
我读到一篇你和他一起写的文章，是关于扑克游戏和核战对策的
{\rEng}I read an article you wrote with him on poker and nuclear war.

665
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,450
吓唬人，是啊，那文章是吓了一些人
{\rEng}Bluffing. Yeah, that shook a few people up.

666
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,720
- 他一定相当惊人 - 他很了不起又有点古怪
{\rEng}- He must have been pretty amazing. - He's a brilliant man. A little flaky.

667
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,920
但他从未了解...他研究成果的实际用途
{\rEng}He never understood the practical uses of his... of his work.

668
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,300
这台在这里的机器运行他的游戏程序
{\rEng}This machine over here runs his game program.

669
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:31,400
约书亚
{\rEng}Joshua.

670
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,660
大卫，过来一下
{\rEng}Come here a minute, David.

671
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,700
看到那个指示牌吗？那个？
{\rEng}See that sign up here? Up here?

672
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,490
- 是的 - 战备状况
{\rEng}- Yeah. - DEFCON.

673
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,990
那表示我们现在的战备状况
{\rEng}That indicates our current defence condition.

674
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,990
它应该显示战备状况5，那表示和平状态
{\rEng}It should read DEFCON 5, which means peace.

675
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:51,710
它仍然停留在状况4，就因为你耍的那个小特技
{\rEng}It's still on 4 because of that little stunt you pulled.

676
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,250
实际上，如果我们没及时解决问题，它可能变成状况1
{\rEng}Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time, it might have gone to DEFCON 1 .

677
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,670
- 你知道那是什么意思吗，大卫？- 不知道，那表示什么？
{\rEng}- You know what that means, David? - No. What does that mean?

678
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,380
第三次世界大战
{\rEng}World War Ill.

679
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,750
哇！
{\rEng}Wow.

680
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:06,880
你闯进我们的系统，只为了打游戏，是吗？
{\rEng}You broke into our system just to play a game, right?

681
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:09,380
是这样，就是这样
{\rEng}That's right. That's exactly right.

682
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,630
在看到新闻后，你必然了解到它有多严重
{\rEng}After the news, you must have realised how serious it was.

683
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:19,090
- 你为什么又再搞一次呢？- 我没有再侵入系统了
{\rEng}- Why'd you do it again? - I didn't do it again.

684
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,140
- 我甚至把电话号码都丢了 - 他们在垃圾里发现了电话号码
{\rEng}- I even threw the number away. - They found it in the trash.

685
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,600
约书亚打电话给我
{\rEng}Joshua called me.

686
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,600
嘿！
{\rEng}Hey!

687
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,050
看看这些装备！真是不错得的设置
{\rEng}Look at that! That's some setup.

688
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:31,440
- 你说什么？- 真是不错得的设置
{\rEng}- What did you say? - This is some setup.

689
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,360
不，不，那句话之前
{\rEng}No, no. Before that.

690
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,520
约书亚打电话给我
{\rEng}Joshua called me.

691
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:39,360
大卫，机器不会打电话给人
{\rEng}David, machines don't call people.

692
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,780
你们的机器打了
{\rEng}Yours did.

693
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,610
你要跟谁一起去巴黎？
{\rEng}Who are you going to Paris with?

694
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,820
巴黎吗？噢！
{\rEng}Paris? Oh!

695
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,740
不...你不知道
{\rEng}No... You don't understand.

696
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,330
你有预订两张到巴黎的机票
{\rEng}You had reservations for two to Paris.

697
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,830
- 你跟谁一起搞的？- 没人！
{\rEng}- Who are you working with? - Nobody!

698
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,920
我为什么不相信你？
{\rEng}Why don't I believe you?

699
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:12,630
我想在我跟律师谈话前，我不该再说任何事了
{\rEng}I don't think I should say anything else until I talk to a lawyer.

700
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:17,290
我想我们还是把律师这档烂事给忘掉吧
{\rEng}I think we'd better forget about the lawyer crap

701
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:20,050
除非我从你那里弄到一些答案
{\rEng}until I get a few answers out of you myself.

702
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,600
你不接电话吗？
{\rEng}Are you gonna answer the phone?

703
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:45,900
哈啰
{\rEng}Hello.

704
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:47,270
是的
{\rEng}Yeah.

705
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,400
什么？
{\rEng}What?

706
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,190
好！我马上下来！
{\rEng}All right. I'll be right down.

707
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,240
你留在这里，不要乱动
{\rEng}You stay here. Don't move.

708
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,280
发生什么事了？
{\rEng}What's going on?

709
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:11,280
已有严重的渗透情况，侵入我们的华普可执行文件
{\rEng}There's been a serious penetration into our WOPR execution order file.

710
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,820
- 他说的什么他妈的？- 说人话
{\rEng}- What the hell's he sayin'? - In English.

711
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,370
我用人话跟你讲，有人侵入麦崔克先生的系统
{\rEng}I'll give it to you. Somebody got into Mr McKittrick's system

712
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,250
并且偷走我们发射导弹的密码
{\rEng}and stole the codes that'll launch our missiles.

713
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,160
没有发布警报的理由，除非我们在战备状况1的情况下
{\rEng}There's no cause for alarm. The system won't accept a launch code

714
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,000
系统不会接受单一发射代码，而我在一小时内就能改好那些代码
{\rEng}unless we're at DEFCON 1 . I can change those codes in an hour.

715
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,590
嗯，谁干的？
{\rEng}Well, who did this?

{\rEng}I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water.

835
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,500
惊喜吧！
{\rEng}Surprise!

836
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:05,710
- 你在这里干什么？- 你电话里听起来好像不太好
{\rEng}- What are you doing here? - You didn't sound too good on the phone.

837
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,920
- 你不应来，我现在有麻烦 - 为什么？
{\rEng}- You shouldn't have come. I'm in trouble. - Why?

838
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,550
这全是因为你帮我改成绩吗？
{\rEng}Is this because of what you did with my grade?

839
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,590
你们这些孩子最好快点，渡轮随时会开
{\rEng}You kids better hustle. The ferry leaves any second.

840
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,760
感谢！赶快！我们得用跑的！
{\rEng}Thanks. Come on. We gotta run.

841
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:32,590
- 等等！等等！等等！等等！哇！- 等一等！等一等！
{\rEng}- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa! - Hold it, hold it!

842
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:45,350
如果他仍然活着，为什么讣文说他死了？
{\rEng}If he's still alive, why would the obituary say he's dead?

843
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,520
不，他没死，他只是离开了
{\rEng}No, he's not dead. He left.

844
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:51,100
当有人知道太多内情时，他们会给他新身份
{\rEng}When they know too much, they give 'em new identities.

845
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,320
- 不论如何，电脑是这样说的 - 噢，电脑这样说的
{\rEng}- Anyway, the computer said so. - Oh, the computer said so.

846
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:58,770
电脑还在玩那场游戏吗？它是军用电脑哎！
{\rEng}The computer that's still playing the games? It's the military's computer!

847
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:02,520
- 军方怎么会不知道这件事？- 他们不知道约书亚的事
{\rEng}- Why wouldn't they know about it? - They don't know about Joshua.

848
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:06,440
法肯了解约书亚，他是唯一知道它能做什么的人
{\rEng}Falken knows about Joshua. He's the only one who knows what it can do.

849
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,490
那台电脑想要赢得我们和它玩的游戏
{\rEng}That computer is trying to win the game that we asked it to play.

850
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,660
真的是这样！
{\rEng}For real!

851
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:14,910
你甚至都不相信我！
{\rEng}You don't even believe me!

852
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,250
大卫...大卫
{\rEng}David... David.

853
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,000
- 他没死 - 对不起
{\rEng}- He's not dead. - I'm sorry.

854
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:31,630
我相信你
{\rEng}I believe you.

855
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:20,740
噢！
{\rEng}Oh!

856
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,280
那是什么？
{\rEng}What was that?

857
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,120
我不知道
{\rEng}I don't know.

858
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:33,580
你看见了吗？仍然有人不相信他们能飞
{\rEng}Did you see that? There are still people who won't believe they could fly.

859
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,830
天空曾经充满了他们
{\rEng}The sky was once filled with them.

860
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,740
- 我正在找罗伯特‧休姆博士 - 你们谁是古生物学家？
{\rEng}- I'm looking for Dr Robert Hume. - Is either of you a palaeontologist?

861
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,920
不是，我们是高中生
{\rEng}No. We're high-school students.

862
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,090
噢...可惜
{\rEng}Oh... Pity.

863
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,050
嗯，高中生
{\rEng}Well, high-school students,

864
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,930
你踩在我的土地上，而我没邀请你
{\rEng}you're on my land and I didn't invite you.

865
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,050
但是
{\rEng}But

866
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,500
你是史蒂芬‧法肯吗？
{\rEng}aren't you Stephen Falken?

867
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,590
现在，仔细听着
{\rEng}Now, listen carefully.

868
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:59,220
路径，顺着路径
{\rEng}Path. Follow path.

869
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:03,180
闸门，打开闸门，穿过闸门，关上闸门
{\rEng}Gate. Open gate, through gate, close gate.

870
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:05,850
最后一班渡船6:30，所以赶快跑、跑、跑
{\rEng}Last ferry 6.30, so run, run, run.

871
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,300
等等！等等！
{\rEng}Wait! Wait.

872
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,480
我是因为约书亚而来
{\rEng}I came because of Joshua.

873
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:56,870
雷达报告有两个不明轨迹，进入阿拉斯加防空区域
{\rEng}Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defence zone.

874
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:02,330
很可能是真的，依飞行特性来看，应是苏联逆火式轰炸机
{\rEng}Confidence is high. Flight profile suggests Soviet backfire bombers.

875
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:07,010
我要目视确认报告，派两架F-16从加利纳紧急起飞
{\rEng}I want a visual confirmation on that. Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

876
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,720
提升到战备状况2
{\rEng}Go to DEFCON 2.

877
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:48,320
水晶宫，这是DF27，没有雷达接触
{\rEng}Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27. I have negative radar contact.

878
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:50,660
重复，没有苏联飞机
{\rEng}Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.

879
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,870
27，我是高级将领 (原文：黄铜帽)，他们就在你们前面！
{\rEng}27, this is Brass Hat. They're right in front of you!

880
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,040
你几乎就飞在他们上面了
{\rEng}You're almost on top of 'em.

881
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:58,740
高级将领，我们雷达上什么也没有
{\rEng}Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar

882
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,950
能见度有40英里
{\rEng}and 40 miles visibility.

883
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:04,830
什么东西也没有，将军，只有蓝色的天空
{\rEng}There's nothin' out there, General. Just blue skies.

884
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,000
真他妈的怎么回事？
{\rEng}What the hell?!

885
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:20,420
- 你一直都没听新闻 - 是的，我有听
{\rEng}- You haven't been listening. - Yes, I have.

886
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,010
我喜欢你用核弹攻击拉斯维加斯这部分
{\rEng}I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas.

887
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:26,550
一个圣经上说适合结束的地方，你不认为吗？
{\rEng}A suitably biblical ending for the place, don't you think?

888
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,300
你会告诉他们约书亚在做什么吗？
{\rEng}Are you gonna tell them what Joshua's doing?

889
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:35,730
现在，孩子们，过来这儿，我将要告诉你们一个床边故事
{\rEng}Now, children, come on over here. I'm going to tell you a bedtime story.

890
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,140
你们坐的还舒服吗？
{\rEng}Are you sitting comfortably?

891
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:40,180
那我要开始讲了
{\rEng}Then I'll begin.

892
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:46,400
很久以前，有一种很了不起的动物
{\rEng}Once upon a time, there lived a magnificent race of animals

893
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:49,650
他们支配着世界，年复一年
{\rEng}who dominated the world through age after age.

894
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,610
他们能跑也能游泳
{\rEng}They ran and they swam

895
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,030
而且他们能战斗也能飞翔
{\rEng}and they fought and they flew.

896
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:58,200
直到忽然间，就在最近，他们消失了
{\rEng}Until suddenly, quite recently, they disappeared.

897
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,700
大自然放弃了他们并重新开始
{\rEng}Nature just gave up and started again.

898
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,450
我们那时甚至还没进化到猿猴
{\rEng}We weren't even apes then.

899
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:09,620
我们只不过是藏在石缝里一些聪明的小啮齿动物
{\rEng}We were just these smart little rodents hiding in the rocks.

900
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:13,500
而当我们灭亡时，大自然将再次重新开始
{\rEng}And when we go, nature will start again.

901
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:16,420
或许是从蜜蜂开始
{\rEng}With the bees probably.

902
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,870
大自然知道什么时候该放弃，大卫
{\rEng}Nature knows when to give up, David.

903
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,040
我没放弃
{\rEng}I'm not giving up.

904
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:26,000
如果约书亚欺骗他们发动攻击，那将是你造成的错误
{\rEng}If Joshua tricks them into launching an attack, it'll be your fault.

905
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,960
我造成的错误？这整个概念是找到练习核战的方法
{\rEng}My fault? The whole point was to find a way to practise nuclear war

906
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,130
而不至于伤到我们自己
{\rEng}without destroying ourselves.

907
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:37,130
让电脑由我们犯不起的错误中学习
{\rEng}To get the computers to learn from mistakes we couldn't afford to make.

908
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,720
只除了我没让约书亚学到最重要的一课
{\rEng}Except I never could get Joshua to learn the most important lesson.

909
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:42,310
是什么？
{\rEng}What's that?

910
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:46,810
无望弃子，也就是你应该放弃的时机
{\rEng}Futility. That there's a time when you should just give up.

911
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:48,980
这算是那一门子课？
{\rEng}What kind of a lesson is that?

912
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,590
你玩过井字游戏吗？
{\rEng}Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

913
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,270
是的，当然
{\rEng}Yeah. Of course.

914
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,440
- 但是现在不玩了？- 不玩了
{\rEng}- But you don't any more? - No.

915
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:57,730
为什么？
{\rEng}Why?

916
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:01,610
因为它是令人厌烦的游戏，老是平手
{\rEng}Because it's a boring game. It's always a tie.

917
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,860
就是这样，没有方法能赢
{\rEng}Exactly. There's no way to win.

918
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:06,560
游戏本身是毫无意义的
{\rEng}The game itself is pointless.

919
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,240
但是回到作战室的场景，他们相信是能打赢一场核战...
{\rEng}But back at the war room, they believe you can win a nuclear war.

920
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,030
...而所受的损失是在可接受的范围内
{\rEng}That there can be acceptable losses.

921
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,370
所以你就放弃了？决定假死？
{\rEng}So you gave up? Decided to play dead?

922
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:24,240
基于安全因素，他们很乐意安排我的死亡
{\rEng}For security reasons, they graciously arranged my death.

923
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,080
你知不知道没有陆上动物能在经历那劫难之后
{\rEng}Did you know that no land animal

924
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:31,710
幸存下来而体重有超过50磅的吗？
{\rEng}with a body weight of over 50lb survived that age?

925
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,760
灭绝是大自然现象的一部分
{\rEng}Extinction is part of the natural order.

926
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,290
胡扯！
{\rEng}Bullshit!

927
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,130
如果我们被灭绝，那不是因为大自然关系 只是因为愚蠢！
{\rEng}If we're extinguished, it's not natural. It's just stupid!

928
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,720
噢！没关系！我已经早就算好了
{\rEng}Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead.

929
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:48,300
我们只离一个主要目标3英里
{\rEng}We're just three miles from a primary target.

930
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:51,470
一毫秒的光辉
{\rEng}A millisecond of brilliant light

931
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,340
然后我们就被蒸发了
{\rEng}and we're vaporised.

932
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:57,770
这比起数百万个经过闷烧以后
{\rEng}Much more fortunate than the millions who'll wander sightless

933
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,380
到处乱跑的瞎子幸运多了
{\rEng}through the smouldering aftermath.

934
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:04,220
我们就免除了还要求生存的恐惧
{\rEng}We'll be spared the horror of survival.

935
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,350
我只有17岁吔！
{\rEng}I'm only 17 years old.

936
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,400
我还不想死
{\rEng}I'm not ready to die yet.

937
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:12,730
你连一个这么简单的电话都不打？
{\rEng}You won't make a simple phone call?

938
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:18,320
如果真的约书亚还活着，你的约书亚
{\rEng}If the real Joshua was still alive, your Joshua,

939
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:21,730
- 你就会打的，对吗？- 看着，我们也许可以争取个几年
{\rEng}- you'd do it, wouldn't you? - Look, we might gain a few years.

940
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:25,280
或许够你生个儿子再看着他死亡
{\rEng}Perhaps time enough for you to have a son and watch him die.

941
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:29,790
但是人类想要自我毁灭的话...
{\rEng}But humanity planning its own destruction...

942
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:32,740
一通电话是阻止不了的
{\rEng}That a phone call won't stop.

943
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:37,750
不可能这样！你不管大家死活！是因为你心已经死了
{\rEng}This is unreal! You don't care about death cos you're already dead.

944
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:42,870
我知道很多有关你的事，你不是这样的人
{\rEng}I know a lot about you. I know you weren't always like this.

945
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,370
你最关心的事是什么？
{\rEng}What was the last thing you cared about?

946
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,340
你们已经错过末班渡船了
{\rEng}You've missed the last ferry.

947
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:03,420
欢迎你们留下，可以睡地板吗？
{\rEng}You're welcome to stay. You want to sleep on the floor?

948
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,060
晚安
{\rEng}Good night.

949
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,890
我们走吧
{\rEng}Let's get outta here.

950
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:27,310
来吧！我们得找到一条船！这里一定有船的
{\rEng}Come on. We'll find a boat. There's gotta be a boat.

951
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,780
总统先生，我们侦测到48艘核潜艇向美国开过来
{\rEng}Mr President, we've got 48 nuclear subs closing on the United States.

952
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,410
还有10万苏联军队在东德集结中
{\rEng}And we've got 100,000 Soviet troops massing in East Germany.

953
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,710
我们正在监视着他们提升战备的轰炸机，是，长官...

01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,400
所有外站，这是水晶宫
{\rEng}All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

上校，这是洛林空军基地，这里的资深指挥官现在不在
{\rEng}Colonel, this is Loring AirForce Base. The senior controllerisn't here right now.

1079
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:39,990
没关系，你是谁？
{\rEng}That's all right. Who are you?

1080
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,790
长官，这是空军士兵多尔蒂，长官
{\rEng}Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

1081
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,330
这是北美空防司令部贝林杰将军
{\rEng}This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1082
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,500
我们当前的局势...
{\rEng}Our current situation...

1083
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:52,790
老兄们，我们目前正在追踪
{\rEng}Men, we're currently tracking

{\rEng}approximately 2,400 inbound Soviet warheads.

1085
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,790
但是现在我们还不能确认
{\rEng}But at the moment we cannot confirm this.

1086
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,540
我重复，我们不能确认
{\rEng}I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1087
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:03,550
30秒后核爆
{\rEng}30 seconds to impact.

1088
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:08,340
我们就在这里陪着你们，我们也已经采取我们所能做的全部措施
{\rEng}We're right there with you guys. We've taken all the steps we can.

1089
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:11,800
准备听我的命令发射导弹
{\rEng}Stand by to launch missiles at my command.

1090
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:21,850
请你们尽可能留在这个频道上面
{\rEng}Stay on this channel as long as you can.

1091
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:24,020
我们会准备妥当
{\rEng}We'll be standing by.

1092
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:26,180
20秒后核爆
{\rEng}20 seconds to impact.

1093
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,650
10...9...
{\rEng}Ten... nine...

1094

1100
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,280
1...爆炸
{\rEng}one... Impact.

1101
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,750
这是水晶宫，你们还在吗？
{\rEng}This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on?

1102
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,130
这是水晶宫，你们还在吗？任何在那里的人？
{\rEng}This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on? Anyone there?

1103
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:19,920
肯定有人在，长官
{\rEng}That's affiirmative, sir.

1104
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,510
是啊！我们在这里！
{\rEng}Yeah! We're here!

1105
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:26,250
- 耶稣基督！我们还活着！- 屏幕正在显示爆炸
{\rEng}- Jesus H Christ! We're still here! - Our boards are showing impact.

1106
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:31,420
没有，长官，没有爆炸，我们活的好好的
{\rEng}No, sir. No impact. We're alive and well.

1107
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:32,970
好！
{\rEng}All right!

1108
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,970
好！
{\rEng}All right!

1109
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:42,270
好！
{\rEng}All right!

1110
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,070
好！召回轰炸机！
{\rEng}All right! Recall the bombers!

1111
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,320
退出导弹！
{\rEng}Stand down the missiles!

1112
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,380
约书亚，你在做什么？
{\rEng}Joshua, what are you doing?

1113
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,050
作战指挥中心，我立刻需要麦崔克博士
{\rEng}COC, I need Dr McKittrick right away.

1114
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,260
- 这是麦崔克 - 长官，我们有问题了
{\rEng}- This is McKittrick. - Sir, we got a problem.

1115
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:38,590
华普不让我登录
{\rEng}WOPR's not letting me log back on.

1116
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:42,090
- 我不能进入系统退出导弹 - 稍等
{\rEng}- I can't get in to stand down the missiles. - Stand by.

1117
01:39:54,980 --> 01:39:56,600
保罗，这是麦崔克
{\rEng}Paul, this is McKittrick.

1118
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:58,970
华普不让我们进去
{\rEng}The WOPR's not letting us back in.

1119
01:39:59,110 --> 01:40:02,640
我知道，没人能进去，我们正在试所有的办法
{\rEng}I know. No one can get back on. We're trying everything.

1120
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:06,230
看起来像整个登录密码档被删掉了
{\rEng}It's like the entire password file has been wiped out.

1121
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,230
我试过了！你不认为我已经试过了吗？
{\rEng}I tried that! Don't you think I would have tried that?

1122
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:14,400
那些是什么？
{\rEng}What are those?

1123
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,570
那些是发射密码
{\rEng}Those are launch codes.

1124
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,740
那是干什么用的？
{\rEng}What are they for?

1125
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:23,120
约书亚尝试要找到正确的密码，好发射导弹
{\rEng}Joshua's trying to find the right codes so he can launch the missiles himself.

1126
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:35,160
怎么啦？
{\rEng}What's happening?

1127
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,790
乱数产生器没在跑
{\rEng}The random number generators aren't running.

1128
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,960
- 有结果吗？- 我还在看
{\rEng}- Got anything? - I'm still looking.

1129
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:42,710
我没主意了，它可能来自任何地方译码
{\rEng}I got no idea. It could be coming from anywhere.

1130
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,960
长官，你最好戴上耳机
{\rEng}Sir, you better get on the headset.

1131
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,040
是？
{\rEng}Yeah?

1132
01:40:50,180 --> 01:40:55,220
将军，机器把我们卡在外面，正把乱数送到发射井
{\rEng}General, the machine has locked us out. It's sending random numbers to the silos.

1133
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:57,390
发射密码，好发射导弹
{\rEng}Codes. To launch the missiles.

1134
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,560
把他妈的电源插头拔掉就好了嘛！
{\rEng}Just unplug the goddamn thing!

1135
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:02,930
- 耶稣基督！- 那不管用，将军
{\rEng}- Jesus Christ! - That won't work, General.

1136
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,390
它会认为是北美空防司令部被毁掉的关系而停电
{\rEng}It would interpret a shutdown as the destruction of NORAD.

1137
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:11,350
发射井的电脑会运行最后的指令，导弹就会发射
{\rEng}The computers in the silos would carry out their last instructions. They'd launch.

1138
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:14,900
- 我们不能解除导弹吗？- 超过1,000个？
{\rEng}- Can't we disarm the missiles? - Over a thousand of them?

1139
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:19,070
没有时间这样做，在这种速度下，它将在5.3分钟内找到发射密码
{\rEng}There's no time. At this rate it'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1140
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,990
麦崔克博士？在非常仔细的考虑之后，先生
{\rEng}Mr McKittrick? After very careful consideration, sir,

1141
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,440
我得出结论：就是你的新防御系统很烂
{\rEng}I have come to the conclusion that your new defence system sucks.

1142
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:33,330
我不必要忍受这些，你这猪眼狗屎人
{\rEng}I don't have to take that, you pig-eyed sack of shit.

1143
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:38,360
我还以为像你这样受过良好教育的人应该讲的比这好一些吧
{\rEng}I was hoping for something a little better than that from a man of your education.

1144
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,540
将军，是总统
{\rEng}General, it's the president.

1145
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,460
你要怎样...你要告诉他什么？
{\rEng}What do you... What are you gonna tell him?

1146
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:52,790
我正命令我们的轰炸机回到待命区
{\rEng}That I'm ordering our bombers back to fail-safe.

1147
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,010
搞到最后，我们可能还是得打这场核战争
{\rEng}We might have to go through this thing after all.

1148
01:41:58,720 --> 01:41:59,710
是的，先生
{\rEng}Yes, sir.

1149
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:10,340
它找到1个了，当他解开全部10个的时候 它就要发射导弹了
{\rEng}He's got one. When he gets all ten, he'll launch the missiles.

1150
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,840
- 嗯，他们不能进入系统，停住它吗？- 不，他们不能
{\rEng}- Well, can't they get in and stop it? - No. They can't.

1151
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,400
他们已经删掉了我的密码
{\rEng}They've taken out my password.

1152
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,440
- 嗯，我们该怎么办呢？- 我不知道，你知道吗？
{\rEng}- Well, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. Do you?

1153
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:25,930
我叫你不要跟它玩游戏的
{\rEng}I told you not to start playing games with that thing.

1154
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,150
它是游戏
{\rEng}It's games.

1155
01:42:33,110 --> 01:42:35,320
- 游戏！- 试试看
{\rEng}- Games! - Try it.

1156
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:39,060
- 约翰，喂给它一个病毒 - 太冒险了，它可能把系统搞垮
{\rEng}- John, feed it a tapeworm. - Too risky. It might smash the system.

1157
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,870
- 孩子们不是从后门程序进入系统吗？- 我们把它关闭了
{\rEng}- Did the kid get in the back door? - We took it out.

1158
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:44,360

{\rEng}- Invade the deep logic. - We hit a fire wall.

01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:47,610
如果它想要玩游戏，那就跟它玩，让它列出游戏清单
{\rEng}If it wants to play a game, then play it. Have it list games.

1160
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:50,660
- 看在老天爷面上！- 他以前玩过
{\rEng}- For Christ's sake! - He's played before.

1161
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:53,160
- 他不可能搞得比现在烂了 - 解出2个码了
{\rEng}- He can hardly do worse. - Two numbers.

1162
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:56,160
我会在火花塞上撒尿，如果我认为它管用的话
{\rEng}I'd piss on a spark plug if I thought it'd do any good.

1163
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:58,960
- 让那个男孩进去，少校 - 列出游戏清单
