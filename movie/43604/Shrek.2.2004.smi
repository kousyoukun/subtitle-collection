<SYNC Start=143027><P Class=KRCC>
It's so good to be home!

<SYNC Start=148714><P Class=KRCC>
Just you and me and......

<SYNC Start=151668><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=157529><P Class=KRCC>
Donkey?

<SYNC Start=158655><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek! Fiona!

<SYNC Start=160187><P Class=KRCC>
Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes!

<SYNC Start=162331><P Class=KRCC>
Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine.


<SYNC Start=165982><P Class=KRCC>
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?

<SYNC Start=170106><P Class=KRCC>
- Donkey, what are you doing here?<br>- Taking care of your love nest for you.

<SYNC Start=173540><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants?

<SYNC Start=178356><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, and feeding the fish!

<SYNC Start=179802><P Class=KRCC>
I don't have any fish.

<SYNC Start=181223><P Class=KRCC>
You do now. I call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

<SYNC Start=184285><P Class=KRCC>
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

<SYNC Start=186803><P Class=KRCC>
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.


<SYNC Start=190037><P Class=KRCC>
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

<SYNC Start=194171><P Class=KRCC>
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

<SYNC Start=197497><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, yeah, that. I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

<SYNC Start=204099><P Class=KRCC>
I thought I'd move back in with you.

<SYNC Start=206222><P Class=KRCC>
- You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.<br>- But Fiona and I are married now.

<SYNC Start=211619><P Class=KRCC>
We need a little time, you know,

<SYNC Start=213477><P Class=KRCC>
to be together.

<SYNC Start=217120><P Class=KRCC>
Just with each other

<SYNC Start=220578><P Class=KRCC>
- Alone<br>- Say no more. say no more. You don't have to waorry about a thing.

<SYNC Start=224177><P Class=KRCC>
I will always be there to make sure nobody bothers you.

<SYNC Start=227362><P Class=KRCC>
- Donkey!<br>- Yes, roomie?

<SYNC Start=229183><P Class=KRCC>
You are bothering me.

<SYNC Start=231776><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...<br>Me and Pinocchio was just going to 

<SYNC Start=236475><P Class=KRCC>
try to catch a tournament, anyway, so...<br> Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

<SYNC Start=241989><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=245297><P Class=KRCC>
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

<SYNC Start=249686><P Class=KRCC>
 Oh. [giggles] I think I remember.

<SYNC Start=252986><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=255742><P Class=KRCC>
- Donkey!<br>
- [Fiona yelps]<br>
- I know, I know! Alone! I'm going! I'm going.

<SYNC Start=260484><P Class=KRCC>
What do you want me to tell these other guys?

<SYNC Start=264250><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=273895><P Class=KRCC>
Enough, Reggie.

<SYNC Start=276458><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=279280><P Class=KRCC>
[clears throat] "Dearest Princess Fiona.

<SYNC Start=281850><P Class=KRCC>
"You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

<SYNC Start=285263><P Class=KRCC>
"for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

<SYNC Start=290675><P Class=KRCC>
"at which time the King <br>"will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your..." uh... "Prince Charming.

<SYNC Start=301404><P Class=KRCC>
"Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

<SYNC Start=304875><P Class=KRCC>
"AKA Mom and Dad."

<SYNC Start=307381><P Class=KRCC>
- Mom and Dad?<br>- Prince Charming?

<SYNC Start=310394><P Class=KRCC>
Royal ball? Can I come?

<SYNC Start=312073><P Class=KRCC>
We're not going.

<SYNC Start=313196><P Class=KRCC>
[both] What?

<SYNC Start=314254><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...shocked to see you like this?

<SYNC Start=319993><P Class=KRCC>
[chuckles] Well, they might be
a bit surprised. But they're my parents, Shrek.

<SYNC Start=324810><P Class=KRCC>
They love me. And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

<SYNC Start=328484><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome
at the country club.

<SYNC Start=332337><P Class=KRCC>
Would you stop it.
They're not like that.

<SYNC Start=334255><P Class=KRCC>
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

<SYNC Start=337875><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

<SYNC Start=340852><P Class=KRCC>
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

<SYNC Start=343450><P Class=KRCC>
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

<SYNC Start=346256><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?

<SYNC Start=350544><P Class=KRCC>
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!


<SYNC Start=352860><P Class=KRCC>
Who says I want
to be part of this family?

<SYNC Start=354978><P Class=KRCC>
You did!
When you married me!

<SYNC Start=358109><P Class=KRCC>
Well, there's some fine print for you!

<SYNC Start=360260><P Class=KRCC>
[exasperated sigh]
So that's it. You won't come?

<SYNC Start=362834><P Class=KRCC>
Tust me!

<SYNC Start=364129><P Class=KRCC>
It's a bad idea. We are not going! And that's final!

<SYNC Start=370923><P Class=KRCC>
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

<SYNC Start=374277><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=376101><P Class=KRCC>
[Gingy] Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.<br>
- Hey, wait for me. Oof!

- [Donkey] Are we there yet?<br>- [Shrek] No.

<SYNC Start=417663><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=421304><P Class=KRCC>
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?<br>- [Fiona] Not yet.

-  Are we there yet?<br>

- [Donkey] Are we there yet?<br>
- [Shrek] Yes.<br>
- [Donkey] Really? <br>
- [Shrek] No!


<SYNC Start=436195><P Class=KRCC>
- Are we there yet?<br>
- [Fiona] No!

<SYNC Start=436626><P Class=KRCC>
- Are we there yet?<br>
- [Shrek] We are not!

<SYNC Start=439126><P Class=KRCC>
- Are we there yet?
- [Shrek & Fiona] No!

<SYNC Start=442940><P Class=KRCC>
- Are we there yet?<br>
- [Shrek & Fiona] No!

<SYNC Start=442955><P Class=KRCC>
- Are we there yet? [Shrek mimics]<br>
- This is why nobody likes ogres.[Shrek mimics]

<SYNC Start=445984><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=449789><P Class=KRCC>
See? This is why noby likes ogres.[Shrek mimics]

<SYNC Start=451175><P Class=KRCC>
Alright, your loss. [Shrek mimics]

<SYNC Start=452895><P Class=KRCC>
- I'm gonna just stop talking.<br>


<SYNC Start=454222><P Class=KRCC>
- Finally!<br>

<SYNC Start=456445><P Class=KRCC>
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

<SYNC Start=459859><P Class=KRCC>
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That's where we're going.

<SYNC Start=466064><P Class=KRCC>
Far, far...[softly] away!

<SYNC Start=469803><P Class=KRCC>
All right, all right, I get it.

<SYNC Start=471718><P Class=KRCC>
I'm just so darn bored.

<SYNC Start=474012><P Class=KRCC>
-Well, find a way
to entertain yourself.<br>
-[sighs]

<SYNC Start=480076><P Class=KRCC>
{Deep sighs}

<SYNC Start=498552><P Class=KRCC>
For five minutes...Could you not be yourself...

<SYNC Start=503541><P Class=KRCC>
[shouts] FOR FIVE MINUTES!

<SYNC Start=507464><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=512900><P Class=KRCC>
Are we there yet?

<SYNC Start=514744><P Class=KRCC>
- [chuckles] Yes!<br>
- Oh, finally!

<SYNC Start=517445><P Class=KRCC>
[fanfare]

<SYNC Start=525683><P Class=KRCC>
[ # Lipps, Inc: Funkytown]

<SYNC Start=526985><P Class=KRCC>
Wow!

<SYNC Start=532770><P Class=KRCC>
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

<SYNC Start=536712><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

<SYNC Start=542566><P Class=KRCC>
# Gotta make a move
to a town that's right for me

<SYNC Start=548802><P Class=KRCC>
- We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.<br>
- [whistle] Halt!

<SYNC Start=555907><P Class=KRCC>
# Well, I talk about it, talk about it,
talk about it, talk about it <br>
- Hey, everyone, look.<br>
# Talk about, talk about movin'... #

<SYNC Start=576016><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?

<SYNC Start=578228><P Class=KRCC>
You working that hat.

<SYNC Start=580751><P Class=KRCC>
[Donkey] Swimming pools! Movie stars!<br>
[cheering][applause][fanfare]

<SYNC Start=626940><P Class=KRCC>
Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband.

<SYNC Start=635554><P Class=KRCC>
- Well, this is it.<br>
- This is it.<br>
- This is it.<br>
- This is it.

<SYNC Start=642149><P Class=KRCC>
[fanfare]
[fanfare and cheering stop]

<SYNC Start=662759><P Class=KRCC>
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

<SYNC Start=668218><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=669733><P Class=KRCC>
So...you still think this was a good idea?

<SYNC Start=675097><P Class=KRCC>
Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

<SYNC Start=679830><P Class=KRCC>
- [softly] Who on earth are they?<br>
- [softly] I think that's our little girl.

<SYNC Start=683855><P Class=KRCC>
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

<SYNC Start=687317><P Class=KRCC>
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

<SYNC Start=690653><P Class=KRCC>
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

<SYNC Start=693476><P Class=KRCC>
[softly] Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

<SYNC Start=697008><P Class=KRCC>
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

<SYNC Start=700420><P Class=KRCC>
- They're my parents.

<SYNC Start=701553><P Class=KRCC>
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

<SYNC Start=703878><P Class=KRCC>
That was for my own...

<SYNC Start=705411><P Class=KRCC>
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

<SYNC Start=709323><P Class=KRCC>
- Harold, we have to be...<br>
- Quick! While they are not looking

<SYNC Start=711599><P Class=KRCC>
we can make a run for it. 

<SYNC Start=713494><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

<SYNC Start=716297><P Class=KRCC>
- A disaster! There is no way...<br>
- You can do this.

<SYNC Start=719101><P Class=KRCC>
- You can do this.<br>
- I really...<br>
- Really...

<SYNC Start=720484><P Class=KRCC>
Don't

<SYNC Start=721145><P Class=KRCC>
want ...to... be

<SYNC Start=726507><P Class=KRCC>
Mom... Dad...

<SYNC Start=730910><P Class=KRCC>
I'd like you to meet my husband...Shrek.

<SYNC Start=737161><P Class=KRCC>
Well, um...It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

<SYNC Start=749035><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
[chuckles nervously]

<SYNC Start=780642><P Class=KRCC>
- Excuse me.[Shrek & Fiona laugh]<br>
- That's good.<br>
- I guess not

<SYNC Start=782866><P Class=KRCC>
Better out than in,
I always say, eh, Fiona?

<SYNC Start=792384><P Class=KRCC>
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

<SYNC Start=796010><P Class=KRCC>
What's up, everybody?

<SYNC Start=798340><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks for waiting.

<SYNC Start=799637><P Class=KRCC>
I had the hardest time finding this place.

<SYNC Start=801274><P Class=KRCC>
No! No! Bad donkey! 

<SYNC Start=803046><P Class=KRCC>
Bad! Down!

<SYNC Start=804265><P Class=KRCC>
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

<SYNC Start=807181><P Class=KRCC>
He helped rescue me from the dragon.

<SYNC Start=809056><P Class=KRCC>
That's me: the noble steed.

<SYNC Start=810650><P Class=KRCC>
- Waiter! How 'bout a bowl for the steed?<br>
- Oh, boy. [slurps]

<SYNC Start=817242><P Class=KRCC>
- Um, Shrek?<br>
- Yeah? Oh, Sorry!

<SYNC Start=820181><P Class=KRCC>
- Great soup, Mrs Q.Mmm!<br>
- No, no. Darling.<br>
-[chuckles nervously] Oh!

<SYNC Start=830476><P Class=KRCC>
- So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.<br>
- Well...

<SYNC Start=835268><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek owns his own land.

<SYNC Start=837641><P Class=KRCC>
- Don't you, honey?<br>
- Oh, yes!

<SYNC Start=841185><P Class=KRCC>
It's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels
and cute little duckies and...

<SYNC Start=849348><P Class=KRCC>
- What?I know you ain't talking about the swamp.<br>
- Donkey!

<SYNC Start=852813><P Class=KRCC>
An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

<SYNC Start=856907><P Class=KRCC>
I suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.

<SYNC Start=863820><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=870071><P Class=KRCC>
- It's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it?<br>
- lndeed. 

<SYNC Start=873764><P Class=KRCC>
I just started eating.<br>
- Harold!

<SYNC Start=876215><P Class=KRCC>
- What's that supposed to mean?<br>
- Dad. It's great, OK?

<SYNC Start=879146><P Class=KRCC>
- For his type, yes.<br>
- My type?

<SYNC Start=882496><P Class=KRCC>
I got to go to the bathroom.

<SYNC Start=883804><P Class=KRCC>
Dinner is served!

<SYNC Start=886035><P Class=KRCC>
Never mind. I can hold it.

<SYNC Start=889788><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=893262><P Class=KRCC>
Bon appetit!

<SYNC Start=894545><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, Mexican food! My favorite.

<SYNC Start=896713><P Class=KRCC>
Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. 

<SYNC Start=899435><P Class=KRCC>
- Everybody dig in.<br>
- Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

<SYNC Start=901776><P Class=KRCC>
I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...

<SYNC Start=905750><P Class=KRCC>
Ogres, yes!

<SYNC Start=907988><P Class=KRCC>
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

<SYNC Start=910926><P Class=KRCC>
- Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

<SYNC Start=916417><P Class=KRCC>
- Dad!<br>
- No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

<SYNC Start=921809><P Class=KRCC>
- Shrek, please!<br>
- I only did that because I love her.

<SYNC Start=924728><P Class=KRCC>
Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle.

<SYNC Start=927874><P Class=KRCC>
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

<SYNC Start=935182><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=936229><P Class=KRCC>
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.


<SYNC Start=943314><P Class=KRCC>
- Harold!<br>
- Shrek!

<SYNC Start=944561><P Class=KRCC>
- Fiona!<br>
- Fiona!<br>
- Mom!

<SYNC Start=946315><P Class=KRCC>
- Harold...<br>
- Donkey!

<SYNC Start=949803><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1032050><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.

<SYNC Start=1033328><P Class=KRCC>
You're all grown up.

<SYNC Start=1039321><P Class=KRCC>
- Who are you?<br>
- Oh, sweet pea! I'm your fairy godmother.

<SYNC Start=1044299><P Class=KRCC>
I have a fairy godmother?

<SYNC Start=1045328><P Class=KRCC>
Shush, shush. Now, don't worry.I'm here to make it all better. With just a...

<SYNC Start=1056212><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1120602><P Class=KRCC>
- Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don't need all this.<br>
- Fine. Be that way.<br>
- We didn't like you, anyway.

<SYNC Start=1129442><P Class=KRCC>
[gasps and mutterings of disapproval]

<SYNC Start=1132453><P Class=KRCC>
- [knocking]
- [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona?

<SYNC Start=1138061><P Class=KRCC>
[dog barks]Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

<SYNC Start=1141523><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, uh...Fairy Godmother, furniture...
I'd like you to meet my husband, 

<SYNC Start=1148083><P Class=KRCC>
- Shrek.<br>
- Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

<SYNC Start=1152424><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

<SYNC Start=1154219><P Class=KRCC>
But that can't be right.

<SYNC Start=1155873><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, great, more relatives!

<SYNC Start=1158353><P Class=KRCC>
She's just trying to help.

<SYNC Start=1159725><P Class=KRCC>
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

<SYNC Start=1163131><P Class=KRCC>
- What?<br>
- I don't want to leave.

<SYNC Start=1164849><P Class=KRCC>
When did you decide this?

<SYNC Start=1166306><P Class=KRCC>
Shortly after arriving.

<SYNC Start=1169489><P Class=KRCC>
- No, that's all right.

<SYNC Start=1171198><P Class=KRCC>
I need to go, anyway.

<SYNC Start=1172808><P Class=KRCC>
But remember, dear. If you should ever need me...
happiness...
is just a teardrop away.

<SYNC Start=1179272><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

Happy, happy, happy...

<SYNC Start=1183543><P Class=KRCC>

Let's go, Kyle.

<SYNC Start=1188024><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1190480><P Class=KRCC>
Very nice, Shrek.

<SYNC Start=1191948><P Class=KRCC>
- What?<br>
- I told you coming here was a bad idea.

<SYNC Start=1194718><P Class=KRCC>
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

<SYNC Start=1197348><P Class=KRCC>
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it.

<SYNC Start=1201808><P Class=KRCC>
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

<SYNC Start=1205989><P Class=KRCC>
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

<SYNC Start=1208637><P Class=KRCC>
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

<SYNC Start=1213801><P Class=KRCC>
- Go on! Say it!<br>
- Like an ogre!

<SYNC Start=1216732><P Class=KRCC>
Here's a news flash for you!
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!<br>
- [yelps]<br>
- [roars]

<SYNC Start=1228170><P Class=KRCC>
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

<SYNC Start=1234647><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1237607><P Class=KRCC>
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.


<SYNC Start=1243931><P Class=KRCC>
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"
[mimics Shrek roaring]

<SYNC Start=1251714><P Class=KRCC>

<SYNC Start=1273919><P Class=KRCC>

- [Lillian] You should. You started it.

<SYNC Start=1277207><P Class=KRCC>
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

<SYNC Start=1281535><P Class=KRCC>
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.


<SYNC Start=1284733><P Class=KRCC>
This is Fiona's choice.

<SYNC Start=1286831><P Class=KRCC>
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

<SYNC Start=1290376><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

<SYNC Start=1294555><P Class=KRCC>
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

<SYNC Start=1298684><P Class=KRCC>
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

<SYNC Start=1303289><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

<SYNC Start=1306241><P Class=KRCC>
Don't you remember when
we were young?

<SYNC Start=1309093><P Class=KRCC>
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...they were in bloom...

<SYNC Start=1313545><P Class=KRCC>
Our first kiss.

<SYNC Start=1315180><P Class=KRCC>
It's not the same!

<SYNC Start=1316849><P Class=KRCC>
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

<SYNC Start=1320859><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

<SYNC Start=1323440><P Class=KRCC>
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

out here for a while.

So, what's new?

<SYNC Start=1361025><P Class=KRCC>

Is that you? My gosh! It's been years.

<SYNC Start=1367555><P Class=KRCC>

- Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

<SYNC Start=1373740><P Class=KRCC>
After I endured blistering winds,

<SYNC Start=1378491><P Class=KRCC>
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

Mommy can handle this.

<SYNC Start=1382941><P Class=KRCC>
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

<SYNC Start=1386945><P Class=KRCC>
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

<SYNC Start=1390975><P Class=KRCC>
And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

<SYNC Start=1395705><P Class=KRCC>
is already married.

<SYNC Start=1398072><P Class=KRCC>
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

<SYNC Start=1400668><P Class=KRCC>
Stop the car!!

<SYNC Start=1404388><P Class=KRCC>
Harold.

<SYNC Start=1407098><P Class=KRCC>
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

<SYNC Start=1411971><P Class=KRCC>
[gasps] Where are we?

<SYNC Start=1413653><P Class=KRCC>
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

<SYNC Start=1416558><P Class=KRCC>

<SYNC Start=1427993><P Class=KRCC>
- No, thank you.

<SYNC Start=1428943><P Class=KRCC>
- Sourdough soft taco, now what'd you want?<br>
- No, really, I'm fine.

<SYNC Start=1430551><P Class=KRCC>
- Your order, Fairy Godmother.

<SYNC Start=1433724><P Class=KRCC>

There you are, dear.

We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

<SYNC Start=1444587><P Class=KRCC>
[sighs deeply] lndeed not.

<SYNC Start=1446479><P Class=KRCC>
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

<SYNC Start=1450304><P Class=KRCC>
- Yes.<br>
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and,

about an ogre problem?

You are told correct.

But for this, I charge

<SYNC Start=2095128><P Class=KRCC>
I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.

<SYNC Start=2099510><P Class=KRCC>
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

<SYNC Start=2103106><P Class=KRCC>
Let's go, Shrek. 

<SYNC Start=2104841><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek?

<SYNC Start=2108633><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2114819><P Class=KRCC>
- Shrek!<br>
- Aw, come on, Donkey. 

<SYNC Start=2116768><P Class=KRCC>
Look at him...in his wee little boots.

<SYNC Start=2120922><P Class=KRCC>
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

<SYNC Start=2123694><P Class=KRCC>
- Let's keep him!<br>
- Say what?<br>
[purrs]<br>
- Ahh!<br>
- Listen. He's purring!

<SYNC Start=2131042><P Class=KRCC>
- Oh, so now it's cute.

<SYNC Start=2132332><P Class=KRCC>
- Come on, Donkey.Lighten up.<br>

<SYNC Start=2134441><P Class=KRCC>
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

<SYNC Start=2137312><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2141541><P Class=KRCC>
[giggles] Shrek!

<SYNC Start=2145845><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek?

<SYNC Start=2159768><P Class=KRCC>
They're both festive, aren't they? 

<SYNC Start=2162040><P Class=KRCC>
What do you think, Harold?

<SYNC Start=2163895><P Class=KRCC>
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.

<SYNC Start=2168391><P Class=KRCC>
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

<SYNC Start=2172305><P Class=KRCC>
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.

<SYNC Start=2174681><P Class=KRCC>
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

<SYNC Start=2176995><P Class=KRCC>
- Mom. Dad.!<br>- Oh, hello, dear.

<SYNC Start=2180222><P Class=KRCC>
What's that, Cedric?

<SYNC Start=2181559><P Class=KRCC>
Right! Coming.

<SYNC Start=2183143><P Class=KRCC>
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

<SYNC Start=2185421><P Class=KRCC>
I haven't.
You should ask your father.

<SYNC Start=2187320><P Class=KRCC>
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

<SYNC Start=2193129><P Class=KRCC>
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?<br>
- Ah, yes! Um...

<SYNC Start=2195326><P Class=KRCC>
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

<SYNC Start=2199389><P Class=KRCC>
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

<SYNC Start=2202121><P Class=KRCC>
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

<SYNC Start=2205996><P Class=KRCC>
Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?

<SYNC Start=2208523><P Class=KRCC>
No, I haven't, dear.

<SYNC Start=2210271><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice... mud hole to cool down in.

<SYNC Start=2214762><P Class=KRCC>
You know, after your
little spat last night.

<SYNC Start=2217536><P Class=KRCC>
Oh. You heard that, huh?

<SYNC Start=2219355><P Class=KRCC>
Darling, the whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be...

<SYNC Start=2223789><P Class=KRCC>
well, a bit of a brute. <br>Him?

<SYNC Start=2226326><P Class=KRCC>
You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

<SYNC Start=2229084><P Class=KRCC>
Well, what did you expect?

<SYNC Start=2230634><P Class=KRCC>
Look at what he's done to you

<SYNC Start=2233732><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek loves me for who I am.

<SYNC Start=2236869><P Class=KRCC>
I would think you'd be happy for me.

<SYNC Start=2239243><P Class=KRCC>
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

<SYNC Start=2242968><P Class=KRCC>
Maybe you should do the same.

<SYNC Start=2249049><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
[both whisper]

<SYNC Start=2259922><P Class=KRCC>
No, really?

<SYNC Start=2262905><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
[both laugh]<br>
[Shrek] Shh...

<SYNC Start=2273699><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

<SYNC Start=2276750><P Class=KRCC>
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

<SYNC Start=2278754><P Class=KRCC>
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

<SYNC Start=2282155><P Class=KRCC>
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? 

<SYNC Start=2284344><P Class=KRCC>
- Ha-ha! Spell!<br>
- [Puss in Boots shrieks with laughter]<br>
[Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh.

<SYNC Start=2288368><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2299659><P Class=KRCC>
- Hi. I'm here to see the...<br>
- The Fairy Godmother.

<SYNC Start=2301903><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sorry. She is not in.

<SYNC Start=2303830><P Class=KRCC>
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

<SYNC Start=2307087><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

<SYNC Start=2311170><P Class=KRCC>
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

<SYNC Start=2314004><P Class=KRCC>
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

<SYNC Start=2316077><P Class=KRCC>
The union?

<SYNC Start=2317398><P Class=KRCC>
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

<SYNC Start=2321858><P Class=KRCC>
- Oh! Oh, right.<br>
- Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

<SYNC Start=2326687><P Class=KRCC>
- Uh... a little. We don't even have dental.<br>
- They don't even have dental.

<SYNC Start=2332806><P Class=KRCC>
Okay, we'll just have
a look around.

<SYNC Start=2334937><P Class=KRCC>
- Oh. By the way. I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here. Know what I'm saying? Huh?<br>
- Huh? Huh? Huh?<br>
- Stop it!

<SYNC Start=2343544><P Class=KRCC>
Of course. Go right in.

<SYNC Start=2347712><P Class=KRCC>
[voices and grinding machines][explosion]

<SYNC Start=2375940><P Class=KRCC>
A drop of desire. <br>
[giggles] Naughty! 

<SYNC Start=2381377><P Class=KRCC>
A pinch of passion

<SYNC Start=2388245><P Class=KRCC>
And just a hint of..<br>
LUST 

<SYNC Start=2393830><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
[laugh]

<SYNC Start=2395962><P Class=KRCC>
- [Shrek] Excuse me.<br>
- [gasps]

<SYNC Start=2397710><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry to barge in like this...

<SYNC Start=2399694><P Class=KRCC>
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here??

<SYNC Start=2402481><P Class=KRCC>
Well, it seems
that Fiona's not exactly happy.

<SYNC Start=2407917><P Class=KRCC>
Oh-ho-ho!
And there's some question
as to why that is?

<SYNC Start=2412745><P Class=KRCC>
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

<SYNC Start=2416437><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2418866><P Class=KRCC>
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...

<SYNC Start=2423955><P Class=KRCC>
[laughs] No ogres!

<SYNC Start=2426024><P Class=KRCC>
Let's see. Snow White. <br>
A handsome prince.

<SYNC Start=2429246><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, no ogres.

<SYNC Start=2431569><P Class=KRCC>
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

<SYNC Start=2433768><P Class=KRCC>
Hansel and Gretel? No!

<SYNC Start=2435819><P Class=KRCC>
Thumbelina? No.

<SYNC Start=2437191><P Class=KRCC>
The Golden Bird,

<SYNC Start=2438136><P Class=KRCC>
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

<SYNC Start=2439895><P Class=KRCC>
No, no, no, no, no!

<SYNC Start=2442922><P Class=KRCC>
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

<SYNC Start=2447004><P Class=KRCC>
All right, look, lady!

<SYNC Start=2448639><P Class=KRCC>
Don't you point...
those dirty green sausages at me!

<SYNC Start=2454401><P Class=KRCC>
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.<br>
Oh!

<SYNC Start=2456525><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry.


<SYNC Start=2457720><P Class=KRCC>
Ah... that's okay. We were just leaving.

<SYNC Start=2461885><P Class=KRCC>
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

<SYNC Start=2464643><P Class=KRCC>
Just... go.

<SYNC Start=2466947><P Class=KRCC>
Come on, guys.

<SYNC Start=2471782><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
TGlF, eh, buddy?

<SYNC Start=2487873><P Class=KRCC>
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

<SYNC Start=2492235><P Class=KRCC>

<SYNC Start=2495980><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2500138><P Class=KRCC>
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!
Man, that stinks!

<SYNC Start=2505941><P Class=KRCC>
Well, you don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses

<SYNC Start=2511257><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=2511706><P Class=KRCC>
Well, one of these has got to help.

<SYNC Start=2513924><P Class=KRCC>
I was just concocting this very plan!

<SYNC Start=2515921><P Class=KRCC>
Already our minds are becoming one.

<SYNC Start=2518924><P Class=KRCC>
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

<SYNC Start=2523957><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

<SYNC Start=2526051><P Class=KRCC>
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

<SYNC Start=2529426><P Class=KRCC>
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

<SYNC Start=2532382><P Class=KRCC>
No problema, boss.
In one of my nine lives, I was the great cat burglar
of

<SYNC Start=2536285><P Class=KRCC>
Santiago de Compostela.<br>
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

<SYNC Start=2539467><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek, are you off your nut?

<SYNC Start=2540877><P Class=KRCC>
Donkey, keep watch

<SYNC Start=2542488><P Class=KRCC>
Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch.I'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside.
I'll laugh, too.
I'll be giggling to myself.


<SYNC Start=2551886><P Class=KRCC>
What do you see?

<SYNC Start=2552664><P Class=KRCC>
Toad Stool Softner?

<SYNC Start=2553998><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution
for marital problems

<SYNC Start=2558463><P Class=KRCC>
- Elfa Seltzer?<br>
- Uh-uh.

<SYNC Start=2560355><P Class=KRCC>
Hex Lax?

<SYNC Start=2561475><P Class=KRCC>
No!<br> Try "handsome."

<SYNC Start=2565167><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry. No handsome.<br>
Hey! How about

<SYNC Start=2569384><P Class=KRCC>
"Happily Ever After"?

<SYNC Start=2571056><P Class=KRCC>
Well, what does it do?

<SYNC Start=2573662><P Class=KRCC>
"It says "Beauty Divine."

<SYNC Start=2576356><P Class=KRCC>
In some cultures, donkeys are revered
as the wisest of creatures.

<SYNC Start=2579685><P Class=KRCC>
Especially us talking ones.

<SYNC Start=2581903><P Class=KRCC>
Donkey!

<SYNC Start=2585524><P Class=KRCC>
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

<SYNC Start=2594888><P Class=KRCC>
Can we get on with this?

<SYNC Start=2599424><P Class=KRCC>
Hurry!

<SYNC Start=2600890><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2609497><P Class=KRCC>
Nice catch, Donkey!

<SYNC Start=2611330><P Class=KRCC>
Finally! A good use for your mouth.

<SYNC Start=2617641><P Class=KRCC>
Come on!

<SYNC Start=2619017><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=2680473><P Class=KRCC>
I don't care whose fault it is.

<SYNC Start=2682683><P Class=KRCC>
- Just get this place cleaned up!!<br>- Yes, Godmother

<SYNC Start=2685659><P Class=KRCC>
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

<SYNC Start=2691126><P Class=KRCC>
- Mother!<br>
- Charming. Sweetheart.

<SYNC Start=2694658><P Class=KRCC>
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

<SYNC Start=2697948><P Class=KRCC>
Whoa, what happened here?

<SYNC Start=2699705><P Class=KRCC>
The ogre, that's what!

<SYNC Start=2701397><P Class=KRCC>
What? Where is he, mom?

<SYNC Start=2703142><P Class=KRCC>
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

<SYNC Start=2705823><P Class=KRCC>
I will smite him where he stands!

<SYNC Start=2708553><P Class=KRCC>
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

<SYNC Start=2713445><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

<SYNC Start=2717327><P Class=KRCC>
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter. That's all.

<SYNC Start=2720061><P Class=KRCC>
Pardon. Um...

<SYNC Start=2721011><P Class=KRCC>
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, 

<SYNC Start=2724362><P Class=KRCC>
- except for one potion.<br>
- What?

<SYNC Start=2730247><P Class=KRCC>
Oh... I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

<SYNC Start=2735768><P Class=KRCC>
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

<SYNC Start=2739161><P Class=KRCC>
"For you and your true love.

<SYNC Start=2741523><P Class=KRCC>
"lf one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

<SYNC Start=2744685><P Class=KRCC>
"Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine."

<SYNC Start=2747162><P Class=KRCC>
You both will be fine?

<SYNC Start=2748862><P Class=KRCC>
I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

<SYNC Start=2752177><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, man, this don't feel right.

<SYNC Start=2753869><P Class=KRCC>
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

<SYNC Start=2755788><P Class=KRCC>
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

<SYNC Start=2758424><P Class=KRCC>
It says, "Beauty Divine."

<SYNC Start=2760672><P Class=KRCC>
How bad can it be?

<SYNC Start=2764874><P Class=KRCC>
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

<SYNC Start=2767372><P Class=KRCC>
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub

<SYNC Start=2769520><P Class=KRCC>
over your chest, think again!

<SYNC Start=2773179><P Class=KRCC>
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

<SYNC Start=2775048><P Class=KRCC>
Allow me to take the first sip.

<SYNC Start=2777106><P Class=KRCC>
It would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

<SYNC Start=2780123><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

<SYNC Start=2783272><P Class=KRCC>
If there'll be any animal testing,
I'll do it.

<SYNC Start=2784746><P Class=KRCC>
That's the best friend's job.

<SYNC Start=2787728><P Class=KRCC>
Now give me that bottle.

<SYNC Start=2789944><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2793988><P Class=KRCC>
How do you feel?

<SYNC Start=2796504><P Class=KRCC>
I don't feel any different.

<SYNC Start=2798920><P Class=KRCC>
I look any different?

<SYNC Start=2800317><P Class=KRCC>
You still look like an ass to me.

<SYNC Start=2802857><P Class=KRCC>
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

<SYNC Start=2806609><P Class=KRCC>
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.<br>
- Shrek?

<SYNC Start=2810820><P Class=KRCC>
You drink that, there's no going back.

<SYNC Start=2812848><P Class=KRCC>
- I know. <br>
- No more wallowing in the mud?

<SYNC Start=2815230><P Class=KRCC>
I know

<SYNC Start=2815902><P Class=KRCC>
- No more itchy butt crack?<br>
- I know!


<SYNC Start=2817672><P Class=KRCC>
But you love being an ogre!

<SYNC Start=2818548><P Class=KRCC>
I know

<SYNC Start=2823719><P Class=KRCC>
But I love Fiona more.

<SYNC Start=2827305><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek, no! Wait!

<SYNC Start=2832698><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
[gurgling]<br>
[fart]

<SYNC Start=2843829><P Class=KRCC>
Got to be... I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

<SYNC Start=2846610><P Class=KRCC>
Maybe it's a dud.

<SYNC Start=2848751><P Class=KRCC>
Or maybe Fiona and l
were never meant to be.

<SYNC Start=2854145><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
Or maybe Fiona and l
were never meant to be.

<SYNC Start=2855777><P Class=KRCC>
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.

<SYNC Start=2858538><P Class=KRCC>
I don't want to die.

<SYNC Start=2859777><P Class=KRCC>
I don't want to die. I don't want to die!
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting! I'm melting!

<SYNC Start=2867966><P Class=KRCC>
- It's just the rain, Donkey.<br>
- [chuckles] Oh.

<SYNC Start=2871817><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2914682><P Class=KRCC>
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired

<SYNC Start=2918756><P Class=KRCC>
- a sleazy hitman to whack you.<br>
- [hisses]

<SYNC Start=2921211><P Class=KRCC>
It'll be better in the morning.

<SYNC Start=2922968><P Class=KRCC>
You'll see...

<SYNC Start=2924267><P Class=KRCC>
# The sun'll come out...

<SYNC Start=2927798><P Class=KRCC>
# Tomorrow
[yawns]
# Bet your bottom... # <br>

<SYNC Start=2930175><P Class=KRCC>
- Bet my bottom? <br>
- I'm coming, Elizabeth!

<SYNC Start=2936001><P Class=KRCC>
Donkey?

<SYNC Start=2936847><P Class=KRCC>
Are you all right?

<SYNC Start=2940039><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, boss. Let's shave him.

<SYNC Start=2942787><P Class=KRCC>
D-Donkey?

<SYNC Start=2951454><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2952882><P Class=KRCC>
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

<SYNC Start=2956414><P Class=KRCC>
What is it, darling?

<SYNC Start=2958719><P Class=KRCC>
Dad...I've been thinking
about what you said.

<SYNC Start=2962775><P Class=KRCC>
And I'm going to set things right.

<SYNC Start=2965115><P Class=KRCC>
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.

<SYNC Start=2967166><P Class=KRCC>
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

<SYNC Start=2970399><P Class=KRCC>
I'm going to go out and find him.

<SYNC Start=2973068><P Class=KRCC>
And then we'll go back 
to the swamp where we belong.

<SYNC Start=2979947><P Class=KRCC>
- Fiona, please!<br>
- Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

<SYNC Start=2987430><P Class=KRCC>
[Both] Fiona!

<SYNC Start=2991689><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3031094><P Class=KRCC>
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

<SYNC Start=3039143><P Class=KRCC>
Good morning, sleepyhead.

<SYNC Start=3040629><P Class=KRCC>
-[All] Good morning!<br> - We love your kitty!

<SYNC Start=3042225><P Class=KRCC>
- Oh... My head...<br>
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.

<SYNC Start=3045621><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks.

<SYNC Start=3052040><P Class=KRCC>
A cute button nose...?

<SYNC Start=3057457><P Class=KRCC>
Thick, wavy locks?

<SYNC Start=3060359><P Class=KRCC>
Taut, round buttocks?

<SYNC Start=3062019><P Class=KRCC>
I'm... I'm...

<SYNC Start=3064479><P Class=KRCC>
- Gorgeous!<br>
- I'll say.

<SYNC Start=3066491><P Class=KRCC>
- I'm Jill. What's your name?<br>- I'm

<SYNC Start=3068971><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek.

<SYNC Start=3070320><P Class=KRCC>
- Um... Shrek.<br>
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

<SYNC Start=3072176><P Class=KRCC>
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.

<SYNC Start=3074578><P Class=KRCC>
- I got it covered.Thanks <br>
- I don't have anything to rub.

<SYNC Start=3077716><P Class=KRCC>
Well, get in line.

<SYNC Start=3078792><P Class=KRCC>
Have you seen my donkey?

<SYNC Start=3080745><P Class=KRCC>
Who are you calling donkey?

<SYNC Start=3083612><P Class=KRCC>
Donkey? You're a...

<SYNC Start=3084487><P Class=KRCC>
A stallion, baby!

<SYNC Start=3087304><P Class=KRCC>
I can whinny.

<SYNC Start=3089116><P Class=KRCC>
[whinnies]
I can count.

<SYNC Start=3090949><P Class=KRCC>
Look at me, Shrek!

<SYNC Start=3092481><P Class=KRCC>
I'm trotting! That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

<SYNC Start=3098176><P Class=KRCC>
"Oh, don't take the potion,

<SYNC Start=3099689><P Class=KRCC>
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."<br>
Pah!

<SYNC Start=3101432><P Class=KRCC>
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.

<SYNC Start=3104493><P Class=KRCC>
"Not intended for heart patients
or those with... nervous disorders."<br>
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah!

<SYNC Start=3115508><P Class=KRCC>
What?

<SYNC Start=3116598><P Class=KRCC>
Se?or? "To make the effects
of this potion permanent,

<SYNC Start=3120330><P Class=KRCC>
"the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight."

<SYNC Start=3124276><P Class=KRCC>
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?

<SYNC Start=3126735><P Class=KRCC>
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!

<SYNC Start=3128540><P Class=KRCC>
- I'll be your true love.<br>
- I'll be true... enough.

<SYNC Start=3133629><P Class=KRCC>
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.

<SYNC Start=3136594><P Class=KRCC>
And take it from me, Boss. You are going to have
one satisfied Princess.

<SYNC Start=3141860><P Class=KRCC>
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

<SYNC Start=3144049><P Class=KRCC>
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...

<SYNC Start=3146759><P Class=KRCC>
- Easy.<br>
-...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been.

<SYNC Start=3150677><P Class=KRCC>
And you're still the same
annoying donkey.

<SYNC Start=3152737><P Class=KRCC>
- Yeah.<br>
- [sighs]

<SYNC Start=3155973><P Class=KRCC>
Well...Look out, Princess.

<SYNC Start=3159394><P Class=KRCC>
- Here comes the new me.<br>
- First things first. We need to get you out of those clothes.<br>
- [all gasp]

<SYNC Start=3169581><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3169849><P Class=KRCC>
- Ready?<br>
- Ready!

<SYNC Start=3176305><P Class=KRCC>
- [Donkey screams]<br>
- Driver, stop!<br>
- Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

<SYNC Start=3179270><P Class=KRCC>
I'm blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever play the violin again?

<SYNC Start=3184142><P Class=KRCC>
You poor creature!

<SYNC Start=3186184><P Class=KRCC>
Is there anything
I can do for you?

<SYNC Start=3188934><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I guess there is one thing.

<SYNC Start=3190744><P Class=KRCC>
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

<SYNC Start=3198078><P Class=KRCC>
- Not bad.<br>
- Not bad at all.

<SYNC Start=3204282><P Class=KRCC>
[both laugh]

<SYNC Start=3208444><P Class=KRCC>
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?

<SYNC Start=3216841><P Class=KRCC>
Thank you, gentlemen!

<SYNC Start=3218317><P Class=KRCC>
Someday, I will repay you. Unless, of course, I can't find you 

<SYNC Start=3222715><P Class=KRCC>
- if I forget.<br>
- [whinnies]<br>
- [Puss in Boots, in angry Spanish]

<SYNC Start=3229486><P Class=KRCC
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

<SYNC Start=3311122><P Class=KRCC>
- Hello, handsome<br>
-Shrek?

<SYNC Start=3316568><P Class=KRCC>
- Princess<br>
- Donkey?

<SYNC Start=3319260><P Class=KRCC>
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too, Huh?

<SYNC Start=3321855><P Class=KRCC>
What potion?

<SYNC Start=3323034><P Class=KRCC>
Well, It's kind of a long story but Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

<SYNC Start=3325902><P Class=KRCC>
- Now, we're sexy! <br>
-Shrek?

<SYNC Start=3335901><P Class=KRCC>
- For you, baby... I could be.<r>-  Yeah, you wish.

<SYNC Start=3339197><P Class=KRCC>
Donkey, where is Shrek?

<SYNC Start=3340414><P Class=KRCC>
He went inside looking for you.

<SYNC Start=3344955><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek?

<SYNC Start=3346533><P Class=KRCC>
Fiona! Fiona!

<SYNC Start=3351167><P Class=KRCC>
You want to dance, pretty boy?

<SYNC Start=3356032><P Class=KRCC>
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

<SYNC Start=3361426><P Class=KRCC>
Fiona?

<SYNC Start=3364487><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek?

<SYNC Start=3366377><P Class=KRCC>
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

<SYNC Start=3368507><P Class=KRCC>
What happened to your voice?

<SYNC Start=3370118><P Class=KRCC>
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

<SYNC Start=3374101><P Class=KRCC>
But not the way I feel about you.

<SYNC Start=3377360><P Class=KRCC>
Fiona?

<SYNC Start=3379865><P Class=KRCC>
Charming?

<SYNC Start=3381505><P Class=KRCC>
Do you think so?

<SYNC Start=3383424><P Class=KRCC>
[laughs] Dad. I was so hoping
you'd approve.

<SYNC Start=3386309><P Class=KRCC>
Um... Who are you?

<SYNC Start=3388421><P Class=KRCC>
Mom, it's me, Shrek.

<SYNC Start=3390353><P Class=KRCC>
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

<SYNC Start=3394101><P Class=KRCC>
but, well, what do you think?

<SYNC Start=3400761><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3402615><P Class=KRCC>
-[Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona!<br>
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

<SYNC Start=3412075><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

<SYNC Start=3417083><P Class=KRCC>
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

<SYNC Start=3421087><P Class=KRCC>
I just wanted her to be happy.

<SYNC Start=3423362><P Class=KRCC>
And now she can be.

<SYNC Start=3425870><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, sweetheart.

<SYNC Start=3428113><P Class=KRCC>
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

<SYNC Start=3431851><P Class=KRCC>
But look at me.

<SYNC Start=3434102><P Class=KRCC>
Look what I've done for her.

<SYNC Start=3435707><P Class=KRCC>
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

<SYNC Start=3439198><P Class=KRCC>
She's a princess,

<SYNC Start=3441565><P Class=KRCC>
and you're an ogre.

<SYNC Start=3443911><P Class=KRCC>
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

<SYNC Start=3455266><P Class=KRCC>
But...

<SYNC Start=3456963><P Class=KRCC>
I love her.

<SYNC Start=3458773><P Class=KRCC>
If you really love her...

<SYNC Start=3461421><P Class=KRCC>
you'll let her go.

<SYNC Start=3464004><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3468525><P Class=KRCC>
- Shrek??<br>- Se?or.

<SYNC Start=3470675><P Class=KRCC>
What's going on?

<SYNC Start=3472207><P Class=KRCC>
Where are you going?

<SYNC Start=3474921><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3479856><P Class=KRCC>
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this,

<SYNC Start=3482769><P Class=KRCC>
would you, Harold?

<SYNC Start=3485989><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3499026><P Class=KRCC>
There you go, boys.

<SYNC Start=3500644><P Class=KRCC>
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

<SYNC Start=3502571><P Class=KRCC>
Hey. Why the long face?

<SYNC Start=3504931><P Class=KRCC>
It was all just 

<SYNC Start=3507105><P Class=KRCC>
a stupid mistake.

<SYNC Start=3509571><P Class=KRCC>
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

<SYNC Start=3515650><P Class=KRCC>
I hate Mondays.

<SYNC Start=3517651><P Class=KRCC>
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

<SYNC Start=3521134><P Class=KRCC>
What choice do I have?

<SYNC Start=3522897><P Class=KRCC>
She loves that pretty boy,

<SYNC Start=3525229><P Class=KRCC>
Prince Charming.

<SYNC Start=3526883><P Class=KRCC>
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

<SYNC Start=3528897><P Class=KRCC>
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

<SYNC Start=3531083><P Class=KRCC>
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

<SYNC Start=3534420><P Class=KRCC>
 Oh. He sounds dreamy.

<SYNC Start=3536454><P Class=KRCC>
 You know...shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

<SYNC Start=3543427><P Class=KRCC>
Look, guys.

<SYNC Start=3545231><P Class=KRCC>
It's for the best.

<SYNC Start=3547166><P Class=KRCC>
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

<SYNC Start=3552156><P Class=KRCC>
Everybody wins.

<SYNC Start=3555188><P Class=KRCC>
Except for you.

<SYNC Start=3557024><P Class=KRCC>
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

<SYNC Start=3560010><P Class=KRCC>
Aye. And that's why
I have to let her go.

<SYNC Start=3564549><P Class=KRCC>
Excuse me, is she here?

<SYNC Start=3567205><P Class=KRCC>
She's, uh... in the back.

<SYNC Start=3571754><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, hello again.

<SYNC Start=3576012><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3578224><P Class=KRCC>
Fairy Godmother.

<SYNC Start=3579558><P Class=KRCC>
Charming.

<SYNC Start=3581220><P Class=KRCC>
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

<SYNC Start=3584292><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I'm afraid Fiona 

<SYNC Start=3586744><P Class=KRCC>
isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

<SYNC Start=3590395><P Class=KRCC>
FYl, not my fault.

<SYNC Start=3592603><P Class=KRCC>
No, of course it's not, dear.

<SYNC Start=3594216><P Class=KRCC>
I mean,
how charming can I be when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

<SYNC Start=3598225><P Class=KRCC>
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

<SYNC Start=3599807><P Class=KRCC>
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, 

<SYNC Start=3603991><P Class=KRCC>
- okay?<br>- [both] What??

<SYNC Start=3605166><P Class=KRCC>
You can't force someone to fall in love!

<SYNC Start=3608333><P Class=KRCC>
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!


<SYNC Start=3612078><P Class=KRCC>
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

<SYNC Start=3616620><P Class=KRCC>
which will be Charming.

<SYNC Start=3620511><P Class=KRCC>
Umm... no.

<SYNC Start=3621372><P Class=KRCC>
What did you say?

<SYNC Start=3622403><P Class=KRCC>
I can't. I won't do it.

<SYNC Start=3623926><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

<SYNC Start=3630219><P Class=KRCC>
And I can take it away
just as easily.

<SYNC Start=3634141><P Class=KRCC>
Is that what you want? 

<SYNC Start=3636287><P Class=KRCC>
Is it?

<SYNC Start=3637443><P Class=KRCC>
No.

<SYNC Start=3639706><P Class=KRCC>
Good boy.

<SYNC Start=3641033><P Class=KRCC>
Now, we have to go.

<SYNC Start=3642681><P Class=KRCC>
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball. He's hopeless.

<SYNC Start=3646130><P Class=KRCC>
He's all high in the front. He can never get to the back.

<SYNC Start=3648354><P Class=KRCC>
 You need someone to do the back.

<SYNC Start=3650449><P Class=KRCC>
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

<SYNC Start=3651928><P Class=KRCC>
Mother?

<SYNC Start=3654447><P Class=KRCC>
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

<SYNC Start=3656869><P Class=KRCC>
The ogre!

<SYNC Start=3658885><P Class=KRCC>
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

<SYNC Start=3663564><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=3665383><P Class=KRCC>
The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout! The coaches are lined up

<SYNC Start=3674788><P Class=KRCC>
as the cream of the crop pours out of them Iike Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

<SYNC Start=3677493><P Class=KRCC>
Everyone who's anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek. And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

<SYNC Start=3684878><P Class=KRCC>
- Look! Hansel and Gretel!<br>
- What the heck are the crumbs for? And right behind them,
 
<SYNC Start=3689895><P Class=KRCC>
- Tom Thumb and Thumbelina! Oh, aren't they adorable!<br>
-[screaming]


<SYNC Start=3694232><P Class=KRCC>
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

<SYNC Start=3698077><P Class=KRCC>
Tired old thing.

<SYNC Start=3701003><P Class=KRCC>
Who's this? Who's this?

<SYNC Start=3702541><P Class=KRCC>
Who is this? Oh. It's the one, it's the only...

<SYNC Start=3708415><P Class=KRCC>
It's the Fairy Godmother!

<SYNC Start=3711043><P Class=KRCC>
Hello, Far, Far Away!

<SYNC Start=3714438><P Class=KRCC>
- Can I get a whoop whoop?<br>
- Whoop Whoop <br>
- May all your endings be happy and...Well, you know the rest!


<SYNC Start=3722766><P Class=KRCC>


<SYNC Start=3724172><P Class=KRCC>
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

<SYNC Start=3726186><P Class=KRCC>
after these messages.

<SYNC Start=3729129><P Class=KRCC>

- I hate these ball shows.
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of T orture!<br>
- I'm not flipping anywhere, 

<SYNC Start=3735198><P Class=KRCC>
Sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.

<SYNC Start=3738222><P Class=KRCC>
Whizzes on you guys.

<SYNC Start=3740347><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

<SYNC Start=3742704><P Class=KRCC>
No, to your left. Your left!

<SYNC Start=3747386><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3748345><P Class=KRCC>
Tonight on "Knights"....

<SYNC Start=3749750><P Class=KRCC>
Now here's a good show!

<SYNC Start=3751297><P Class=KRCC>
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

<SYNC Start=3754602><P Class=KRCC>
It's time

<SYNC Start=3755169><P Class=KRCC>
to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes

<SYNC Start=3758866><P Class=KRCC>
- just won't fly.<br>
- Why you grabbing me? Police brutality!

<SYNC Start=3764971><P Class=KRCC>
- Come on, I have to talk to Princess Fiona!
- We warned you!<br>
- Ow! Ow!

<SYNC Start=3770340><P Class=KRCC>
- Will they get away with it? Did someone let the cat out of the bag?

<SYNC Start=3772931><P Class=KRCC>
You capitalist pig dogs!

<SYNC Start=3776382><P Class=KRCC>
No, no. there

<SYNC Start=3780460><P Class=KRCC>
- Catnip!<br>
- That's not mine.<br>
- Hold on,

<SYNC Start=3783517><P Class=KRCC>
Find Princess Fiona!

<SYNC Start=3785956><P Class=KRCC>
I'm a donkey!

<SYNC Start=3787036><P Class=KRCC>
Tell her Shrek...

<SYNC Start=3788154><P Class=KRCC>
- I'm her husband, Shrek!<br>
- Quick! Rewind it!

<SYNC Start=3791809><P Class=KRCC>


<SYNC Start=3801553><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
[knock on door]

<SYNC Start=3825942><P Class=KRCC>
Darling? Ah. I thought I might
find you here.

<SYNC Start=3827858><P Class=KRCC>
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

<SYNC Start=3832479><P Class=KRCC>
I'm not going.

<SYNC Start=3833763><P Class=KRCC>
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

<SYNC Start=3837423><P Class=KRCC>
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

<SYNC Start=3842398><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, look at him.

<SYNC Start=3846281><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, he is a bit different, but people change

<SYNC Start=3849333><P Class=KRCC>
for the ones they love.

<SYNC Start=3851186><P Class=KRCC>
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

<SYNC Start=3853871><P Class=KRCC>
Change?

<SYNC Start=3855814><P Class=KRCC>
He's completely lost his mind!

<SYNC Start=3858280><P Class=KRCC>
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?


<SYNC Start=3861453><P Class=KRCC>
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

<SYNC Start=3865233><P Class=KRCC>
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

<SYNC Start=3869836><P Class=KRCC>
I'd give anything to have him back.

<SYNC Start=3874706><P Class=KRCC>
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

<SYNC Start=3878273><P Class=KRCC>
Otherwise I'm up all night.

<SYNC Start=3886770><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks.

<SYNC Start=3890150><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
I got to get out of here! You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

<SYNC Start=3894204><P Class=KRCC>
What about my Miranda rights?

<SYNC Start=3896550><P Class=KRCC>
You're supposed to say

<SYNC Start=3897433><P Class=KRCC>
I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!

<SYNC Start=3900897><P Class=KRCC>
Donkey, You have the right to remain silent.

<SYNC Start=3904395><P Class=KRCC>
What you lack is the capacity.

<SYNC Start=3906993><P Class=KRCC>
I must hold on before l, too,
go totally mad.

<SYNC Start=3910764><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek? Donkey?

<SYNC Start=3914263><P Class=KRCC>
Too late.

<SYNC Start=3915137><P Class=KRCC>
Gingy! Pinocchio!

<SYNC Start=3916802><P Class=KRCC>
Get us out of here!

<SYNC Start=3924411><P Class=KRCC>
Fire in ze hole!

<SYNC Start=3945433><P Class=KRCC>
Look out below!

<SYNC Start=3947361><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=3949464><P Class=KRCC>
Quick! Tell a lie!

<SYNC Start=3950870><P Class=KRCC>
- What should I say?<br>
- Anything, but quick!

<SYNC Start=3953540><P Class=KRCC>
Say something crazy like
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"

<SYNC Start=3956009><P Class=KRCC>
I am wearing ladies' underwear.

<SYNC Start=3962714><P Class=KRCC>
Are you?

<SYNC Start=3963859><P Class=KRCC>
I most certainly am not!

<SYNC Start=3965705><P Class=KRCC>
- It looks like you
most certainly am are!<br>
- I am not!

<SYNC Start=3969458><P Class=KRCC>
- I am not!<br>
- What kind?<br>
- It's a thong!<br>
- Oww! They're briefs!

<SYNC Start=3970845><P Class=KRCC>
- Are not.<br>

<SYNC Start=3972226><P Class=KRCC>
- Are not!<br>

<SYNC Start=3989421><P Class=KRCC>
- Excuse me?<br>

<SYNC Start=3989003><P Class=KRCC>
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

<SYNC Start=3993244><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry, boss.

<SYNC Start=3994117><P Class=KRCC>
Quit messing around! We've got to stop that kiss!

<SYNC Start=3996840><P Class=KRCC>
I thought you was going
to let her go.

<SYNC Start=3998627><P Class=KRCC>
I was, but I can't let them
do this to Fiona.

<SYNC Start=4001375><P Class=KRCC>
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

<SYNC Start=4004086><P Class=KRCC>
It's impossible!

<SYNC Start=4005420><P Class=KRCC>
We'll never get in.
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!

<SYNC Start=4007923><P Class=KRCC>
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

<SYNC Start=4019701><P Class=KRCC>
 What?

<SYNC Start=4021116><P Class=KRCC>
Do you still know the Muffin Man?

<SYNC Start=4023188><P Class=KRCC>
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane.

<SYNC Start=4026057><P Class=KRCC>
Why?

<SYNC Start=4027286><P Class=KRCC>
Because we're gonna need flour.

<SYNC Start=4029754><P Class=KRCC>
Lots and lots of flour.

<SYNC Start=4035940><P Class=KRCC>
Gingy!

<SYNC Start=4037270><P Class=KRCC>
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

<SYNC Start=4042146><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4068418><P Class=KRCC>
Go, baby, go!
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

<SYNC Start=4073918><P Class=KRCC>
No, you great stupid pastry!

<SYNC Start=4077385><P Class=KRCC>
- Come on!<br>

<SYNC Start=4090403><P Class=KRCC>
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

<SYNC Start=4092888><P Class=KRCC>
- Pretty pony wants to play
at the castle!<br>
- Pretty pony.

<SYNC Start=4099250><P Class=KRCC>
Ladies and gentlemen. Presenting Princess Fiona

<SYNC Start=4102775><P Class=KRCC>

<SYNC Start=4108045><P Class=KRCC>
- Shrek, what are you doing?<br>- I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

<SYNC Start=4113000><P Class=KRCC>
Is that glitter on your lips?

<SYNC Start=4115862><P Class=KRCC>
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?

<SYNC Start=4118076><P Class=KRCC>
- Ugh! What is with you?<br>- But, Muffin Cake...

<SYNC Start=4125355><P Class=KRCC>
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

<SYNC Start=4128446><P Class=KRCC>
Ladies and gentlemen.

<SYNC Start=4132407><P Class=KRCC>
I'd like to dedicate this song to...

<SYNC Start=4135112><P Class=KRCC>
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

<SYNC Start=4140322><P Class=KRCC>
Fiona, my Princess.

<SYNC Start=4142247><P Class=KRCC>
Will you honor me with a dance?

<SYNC Start=4146555><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4164382><P Class=KRCC>
Since when do you dance?

<SYNC Start=4166102><P Class=KRCC>
Fiona, my dearest,

<SYNC Start=4167649><P Class=KRCC>
if there's one thing I know, it's that love is full of surprises.

<SYNC Start=4174237><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4182236><P Class=KRCC>
Hit it!

<SYNC Start=4189500><P Class=KRCC>
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

<SYNC Start=4194011><P Class=KRCC>
- Man the catapults!<br>
- Aim! Fire!

<SYNC Start=4199595><P Class=KRCC>
Brace yourselves!

<SYNC Start=4202121><P Class=KRCC>
- Ooh! Purty!<br>
- Not the gumdrop button!

<SYNC Start=4221885><P Class=KRCC>
Go, Mongo! 

<SYNC Start=4224834><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4231901><P Class=KRCC>
Go, Mongo! Go!

<SYNC Start=4236913><P Class=KRCC>
- Man the cauldrons!<br>
- After you, Mongo.<br>
- That's it! Heave-ho!<br>
- Watch out!

<SYNC Start=4256245><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek!

<SYNC Start=4261218><P Class=KRCC>
More heat, less foam!

<SYNC Start=4264211><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4314893><P Class=KRCC>
- Heave! Ho!<br>

Go! Go! Your lady needs you!

<SYNC Start=4346699><P Class=KRCC>

<SYNC Start=4350307><P Class=KRCC>
Today, I repay my debt.

<SYNC Start=4355809><P Class=KRCC>

<SYNC Start=4364098><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4374806><P Class=KRCC>
Stop!

<SYNC Start=4378547><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
[Donkey whinnies]

<SYNC Start=4380535><P Class=KRCC>
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.<br>
- Shrek?

<SYNC Start=4385952><P Class=KRCC>
You couldn't just go back to your swamp
and leave well enough alone.

<SYNC Start=4390477><P Class=KRCC>
- Now!<br>
- Pigs und blanket!

<SYNC Start=4395892><P Class=KRCC>
- Pinocchio! Get the wand!<br>
- I see London! I see France!<br>
- Whah!


- I'm a real boy!<br>
- Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!

<SYNC Start=4402750><P Class=KRCC>
I'm a real boy. Aah!

<SYNC Start=4410877><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4428111><P Class=KRCC>
That's mine!

<SYNC Start=4432092><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4434235><P Class=KRCC>
- Pray for mercy, from Puss...<br>
- And Donkey!

<SYNC Start=4437554><P Class=KRCC>
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

<SYNC Start=4443650><P Class=KRCC>
No!

<SYNC Start=4449247><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4466894><P Class=KRCC>
- Fiona.<br>
- Shrek.

<SYNC Start=4469150><P Class=KRCC>
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

<SYNC Start=4473009><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I guess I gave her
the wrong tea. 

<SYNC Start=4477078><P Class=KRCC>
- Mommy!<br>
- Mommy?

<SYNC Start=4480802><P Class=KRCC>
I told you. Ogres don't live happily ever after.

<SYNC Start=4488613><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4489286><P Class=KRCC>
Harold!

<SYNC Start=4511196><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, Dad!

<SYNC Start=4516365><P Class=KRCC>
- Is he...?<br>
- Yup.<br>
- He croaked.
- Harold?

<SYNC Start=4525162><P Class=KRCC>
Dad?

<SYNC Start=4527345><P Class=KRCC>
I'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

<SYNC Start=4529802><P Class=KRCC>
And he gave you a hard time!

<SYNC Start=4531374><P Class=KRCC>
- Donkey!<br>
- No, no, he's right. I'm sorry.

<SYNC Start=4535035><P Class=KRCC>
To both of you. I only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

<SYNC Start=4540010><P Class=KRCC>
But I can see now...

<SYNC Start=4542403><P Class=KRCC>
she already has it.

<SYNC Start=4545136><P Class=KRCC>
Shrek, Fiona... Will you accept
an old frog's apologies...

<SYNC Start=4552140><P Class=KRCC>
and my blessing?

<SYNC Start=4554803><P Class=KRCC>
- Harold?<br>
- I'm sorry, Lillian.

<SYNC Start=4557622><P Class=KRCC>
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve. 

<SYNC Start=4562372><P Class=KRCC>
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

<SYNC Start=4566095><P Class=KRCC>
warts and all.

<SYNC Start=4571554><P Class=KRCC>
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

<SYNC Start=4574079><P Class=KRCC>
Midnight! Fiona.

<SYNC Start=4577257><P Class=KRCC>
Is this what you want? To be this way forever?

<SYNC Start=4580137><P Class=KRCC>
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

<SYNC Start=4585556><P Class=KRCC>
we can stay like this.

<SYNC Start=4588805><P Class=KRCC>
You'd do that? For me?

<SYNC Start=4601349><P Class=KRCC>
I want what any princess wants.

<SYNC Start=4604379><P Class=KRCC>
To live happily ever after...

<SYNC Start=4608253><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4611084><P Class=KRCC>
with the ogre I married.

<SYNC Start=4616302><P Class=KRCC>
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!

<SYNC Start=4619814><P Class=KRCC>
You cannot make me cry!

<SYNC Start=4625061><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4647193><P Class=KRCC>
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.
Oh, no.

<SYNC Start=4659946><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4672602><P Class=KRCC>
 Hey. You still look like
a noble steed to me.

<SYNC Start=4680403><P Class=KRCC>
Now, where were we?

<SYNC Start=4683081><P Class=KRCC>
Oh. I remember.

<SYNC Start=4688284><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4692598><P Class=KRCC>
- Hey! Isn't we supposed to be having a fiesta?<br>
- Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

<SYNC Start=4705343><P Class=KRCC>
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

<SYNC Start=4712031><P Class=KRCC>
Sing it, Puss!

<SYNC Start=4714027><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4720156><P Class=KRCC>
Here we go!

<SYNC Start=4724824><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4776995><P Class=KRCC>
Hey, Donkey, that's Spanish!
