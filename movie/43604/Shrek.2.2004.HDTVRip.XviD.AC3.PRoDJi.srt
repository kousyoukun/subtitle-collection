# So she said
what's the problem, baby?

3
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,960
# What's the problem?
I don't know

4
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,960
# Well, maybe I'm in love

5
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,440
# Think about it
every time I think 'bout it

6
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,720
# Can't stop thinking 'bout it

7
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,840
# How much longer
will it take to cure this?

8
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,400
# Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it

9
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
# If it's love, love

10
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,040
# Makes me wanna turn around
and face me

11
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,600
# But I don't know nothing
'bout love

12
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,440
# Oh, come on, come on

13
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,600
- # Turn a little faster

14
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,120
# Come on, come on

15
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,200
# The world will follow after

16
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,720
# Come on, come on

17
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,280
# Everybody's after love

18
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,960
# So I said
I'm a snowball running

19
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,720
# Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love

20
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,080
# Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight

21
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,120
# Shimmering love

22
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
# Well, baby, I surrender

23
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
# To the strawberry ice cream

24
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,800
# Never ever end of all this love

25
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,720
# Well, I didn't mean to do it

26
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,920
# But there's no escaping your love

27
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,600
# These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone

28
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
# Never alone, no, no

29
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
# Come on, come on

30
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,280
# Jump a little higher

31
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
# Come on, come on

32
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,600
# If you feel a little lighter

33
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,840
# Come on, come on

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,040
# We were once upon a time in love

35
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,040
Hyah!

36
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,800
# We're accidentally in love

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,560
# Accidentally in love

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,240
# Accidentally in love

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,680
# Accidentally in love

40
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,920
# Accidentally in love

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
# Accidentally in love

42
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,400
# Accidentally in love

43
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,880
# Accidentally

44
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,120
# I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
# I'm in love, I'm in love

46
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,480
# Accidentally in love

47
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,160
# I'm in love

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,920
# I'm in love #

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,040
It's so good to be home!

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,640
Just you and me and...

51
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,880
- # Two can be as bad as one... #
- Donkey?

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,640
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

53
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,960
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

54
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,160
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?

55
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,280
Donkey, what are you doing here?

56
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,320
Taking care of your love nest for you.

57
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,560
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants?

58
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,480
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.

59
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,520
You do now. I call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

60
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,400
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,080
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.

62
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

63
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,000
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

64
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,120
Oh, yeah, that.

65
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,680
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

66
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,320
I thought I'd move in with you.

67
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,040
You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

68
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,800
But Fiona and I are married now.

69
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,040
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

70
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Just with each other.

71
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,480
Alone.

72
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

73
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,960
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,080
You're bothering me.

76
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,440
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...

77
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,640
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament, anyway, so...

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,320
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

79
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,200
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

80
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
Oh.

81
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
I think I remember.

82
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,680
- Donkey!

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,760
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.

84
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,720
What do you want me
to tell these other guys?

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
Enough, Reggie.

86
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,840
"Dearest Princess Fiona.

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,920
"You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,480
"for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

89
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,640
"at which time the King

90
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,520
"will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your..."

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,640
uh..."Prince Charming.

92
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,200
"Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

93
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,600
"aka Mom and Dad."

94
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,960
Mom and Dad?

95
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,280
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?

96
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,080
- We're not going.
- What?

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,000
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

98
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,960
shocked to see you like this?

99
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,360
Well, they might be
a bit surprised.

100
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,480
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,840
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

102
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,800
Yeah, right.

103
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,520
Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome
at the country club.

104
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
Stop it.
They're not like that.

105
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,760
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

106
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,120
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

107
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,160
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

108
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,000
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

109
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,040
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?

110
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,440
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

111
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,480
Who says I want
to be part of this family?

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,440
You did!
When you married me!

113
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,480
Well, there's some fine print for you!

114
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,440
So that's it. You won't come?

115
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,560
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!

116
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

117
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,160
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

118
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,120
- Hey, wait for me. Oof!

119
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
# Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!

120
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,120
# Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!

121
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,400
# Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!

122
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,680
# Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!

123
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,720
# Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!

124
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,280
# Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!

125
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,800
# Rawhide! #
Yee-haw!

126
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,600
- Are we there yet?
- No.

127
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,480
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

128
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,520
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.

129
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,200
- Are we there yet?
- No!

130
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,240
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

131
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
- Really?
- No!

132
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,040
- Are we there yet?
- No!

133
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,840
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!

134
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,400
- Are we there yet?
- No!

135
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,440
- Are we there yet?

136
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,400
- That's not funny. That's really immature.

137
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,680
- This is why nobody likes ogres.

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,000
- Your loss!

139
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,280
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!

140
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,800
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

141
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,520
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

142
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,760
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

143
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,360
away!

144
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,880
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.

145
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,400
Well, find a way
to entertain yourself.

146
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,720
For five minutes...

147
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
Could you not be yourself...

148
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,200
... for five minutes!

149
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,640
Are we there yet?

150
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,240
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

151
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,520
Wow!

152
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,920
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

153
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Hey, good-Iooking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

154
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,040
# Gotta make a move
to a town that's right for me

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,600
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

156
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
Halt!

157
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,560
# Well, I talk about it, talk about it,
talk about it, talk about it

158
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,760
Hey, everyone, look.

159
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,200
# Talk about, talk about movin'... #

160
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,040
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

161
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,240
Swimming pools!
Movie stars!

162
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,200
Announcing the long-awaited return

163
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,640
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

164
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,960
Well, this is it.

165
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,920
- This is it.
- This is it.

166
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
This is it.

167
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,320
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

168
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,440
So...

169
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,400
you still think
this was a good idea?

170
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

171
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,800
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that's our little girl.

172
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,120
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

173
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,320
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

174
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,520
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

175
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,120
Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

176
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,520
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

177
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

178
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,240
That was for my own...

179
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,040
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

180
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,280
Harold, we have to be...

181
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,160
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

182
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,160
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

183
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,520
A disaster! There is no way...

184
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,120
- You can do this.
- I really...

185
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
- Really...
- don't... want... to... be...

186
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Here!

187
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,560
Mom... Dad...

188
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
I'd like you to meet my husband...

189
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
Shrek.

190
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,520
Well, um...

191
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,840
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

192
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,520
- Excuse me.

193
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,160
Better out than in,
I always say, eh, Fiona?

194
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,120
That's good.

195
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
I guess not.

196
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,200
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

197
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,240
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

198
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,840
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

199
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,160
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

200
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,960
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

201
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,360
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.

202
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,400
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?

203
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, boy.

204
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,000
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?

205
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,440
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.

206
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,480
Mmm!

207
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,480
No, no. Darling.

208
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,280
Oh!

209
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,520
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.

210
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,040
Well...

211
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
Shrek owns his own land.

212
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,680
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

213
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
It's in an enchanted forest

214
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,080
abundant in squirrels
and cute little duckies and...

215
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,440
What?

216
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,640
I know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

217
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,640
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.

218
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,520
I suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.

219
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,320
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

220
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,200
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!

221
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?

222
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,040
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

223
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
I got to go to the bathroom.

224
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,840
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

225
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,440
Bon appetit!

226
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,920
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.

227
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,440
Let's not sit here with our tummies
rumbling. Everybody dig in.

228
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,840
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

229
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,560
I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,920
Ogres, yes!

231
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,840
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

232
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,560
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

233
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,720
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

234
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,600
Dad!

235
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,080
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

236
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,720
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.

237
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

238
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,120
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

239
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,280
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

240
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,800
- Harold!
- Shrek!

241
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,760
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

242
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,080
- Mom!
- Harold...

243
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,120
Donkey!

244
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,640
# Your fallen tears have called to me

245
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,320
# So, here comes my sweet remedy

246
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,520
# I know what every princess needs

247
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,240
# For her to live life happily... #

248
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,080
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.

249
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,880
You're all grown up.

250
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,440
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

251
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm your fairy godmother.

252
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,080
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

253
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,320
Now, don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.

254
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,320
With just a...

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,440
# Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone

256
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,200
# With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash

257
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,160
# A high-priced dress
made by mice no less

258
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,280
# Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress

259
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,240
# Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse

260
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
# Confide in your very own
furniture friends

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,080
# We'll help you set a new fashion trend

262
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,960
- # I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
- # The kind of girl a prince would date!

263
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,280
# They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...

264
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
# "For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!"

265
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,240
# A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle

266
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,720
# Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away

267
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
# And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frise! '

268
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,120
# Nip and tuck, here and there
to land that prince with the perfect hair

269
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,520
# Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get that prince with the sexy tush

270
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,440
# Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay

271
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,600
# You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune

272
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,200
# Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs

273
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,840
# Cheese souffle, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!

274
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,400
# Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair #

275
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,440
Stop!

276
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,240
Look...

277
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,880
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

278
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,760
but I really don't need all this.

279
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,480
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

280
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,480
- Fiona? Fiona?

281
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,360
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

282
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, uh...

283
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

284
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

285
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,960
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

286
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,600
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

287
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,440
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

288
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,240
She's just trying to help.

289
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,440
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

290
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
- What?
- I don't want to leave.

291
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,480
When did you decide this?

292
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,160
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

293
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,440
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.

294
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,720
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me...

295
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,880
happiness...

296
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,600
is just a teardrop away.

297
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,160
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

298
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,000
Happy, happy, happy...

299
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,160
So I see.

300
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,040
Let's go, Kyle.

301
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,120
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

302
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,800
I told you coming here was a bad idea.

303
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,400
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

304
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

305
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,800
even if I did want it.

306
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,720
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

307
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,080
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

308
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,880
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

309
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,800
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

310
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,280
Here's a news flash for you!

311
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,120
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!

312
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,320
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

313
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,840
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

314
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"

315
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,720
I knew this would happen.

316
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,680
You should.
You started it.

317
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,560
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

318
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,960
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

319
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,320
This is Fiona's choice.

320
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,360
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

321
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,440
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

322
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

323
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,800
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

324
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,360
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

325
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,160
Don't you remember when
we were young?

326
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,080
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

327
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,280
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

328
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,640
It's not the same!

329
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,600
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

330
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,920
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

331
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,800
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

332
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,800
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!

333
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,760
I'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

334
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,080
- Hello, Harold.

335
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,120
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

336
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,080
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

337
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

338
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,760
You better get in.
We need to talk.

339
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

340
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,480
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

341
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,240
So, how about... we make this
a quick visit. What?

342
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

343
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,160
So, what's new?

344
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,800
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

345
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,240
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

346
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,360
When did you get back?

347
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,280
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

348
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,720
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

349
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,720
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

350
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,120
Mommy can handle this.

351
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,120
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

352
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,000
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

353
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,160
And what does he find?

354
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,800
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

355
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,680
is already married.

356
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,160
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

357
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,840
Stop the car!

358
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,880
Harold.

359
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,360
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

360
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,320
Where are we?

361
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

362
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,280
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy. Er... okay.

363
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,080
Two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo... chili rings...

364
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,480
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

365
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,520
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

366
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,200
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.

367
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,000
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

368
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,200
There you are, dear.

369
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,160
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

370
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,280
Indeed not.

371
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,920
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

372
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,320
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

373
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
Not only for your daughter...

374
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
but for your Kingdom.

375
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,440
What am I supposed to do about it?

376
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,840
Use your imagination.

377
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
Oh...

378
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,680
Come on in, Your Majesty.

379
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,400
# I like my town

380
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,640
# With a little drop of poison

381
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,000
# Nobody knows...

382
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,240
Excuse me.

383
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,520
Do I know you?

384
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,280
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

385
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,920
Uh... excuse me.
I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

386
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,200
Ah! There you are. Right.

387
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,400
You see, I need to have
someone taken care of.

388
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,600
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

389
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,440
Um... He's an ogre.

390
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,800
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

391
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,040
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

392
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,760
he don't like to be disturbed.

393
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,200
he don't like to be disturbed.

394
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,840
Where could I find him?

395
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
Hello?

396
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,000
Who dares enter my room?

397
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,560
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to

398
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,280
about an ogre problem?

399
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,560
You are told correct.

400
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,280
But for this, I charge
a great deal of money.

401
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,400
Would... this be enough?

402
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,920
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

403
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,160
Just tell me where
I can find this ogre.

404
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,800
# Everyone says
I'm getting down too low

405
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,400
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go

406
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,040
# You just gotta let it go

407
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,400
# I need some sleep

408
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,720
# Time to put the old horse down

409
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,440
# I'm in too deep

410
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,680
# And the wheels keep spinning round

411
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,160
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go #

412
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,760
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go #

413
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,040
Dear Knight, I pray that you take
this favor as a token of my gratitude.

414
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,680
Dear Diary...

415
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,360
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

416
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,080
but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.

417
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,600
Dad says I'm going away for a while.

418
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,920
Must be like some finishing school.

419
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,680
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

420
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,360
my Prince Charming will rescue me
from my tower

421
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,920
and bring me back to my family,

422
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,040
and we'll all live
happily ever after.

423
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,720
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

424
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,000
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

425
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,400
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

426
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,680
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

427
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,720
Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

428
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,160
No, no. I was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.

429
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,080
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

430
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,520
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.

431
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,920
Do you suppose we could pretend
it never happened and start over...

432
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,920
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

433
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,960
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

434
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,400
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

435
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,760
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

436
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,800
A little father-son time?

437
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,920
I know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

438
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,280
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?

439
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,480
Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.

440
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,200
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

441
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,600
"Head to the
darkest part of the woods..."

442
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,600
"Past the sinister trees
with scary-Iooking branches."

443
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,760
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

444
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,600
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

445
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,960
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

446
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,920
and I end up lost
in the woods with you!

447
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,160
Don't get huffy!
I'm only trying to help.

448
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,120
I know! I know.

449
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,600
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

450
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,720
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.

451
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,560
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

452
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,520
Well, well, well, Donkey.

453
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,000
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

454
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,760
What? I ain't purring.

455
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,040
Sure. What's next? A hug?

456
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,080
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...

457
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,640
Ha-ha!
Fear me, if you dare!

458
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,040
Look! A little cat.

459
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,120
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

460
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,120
Come here,
little kitty, kitty.

461
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,080
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

462
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,920
- Whoa!

463
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,040
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

464
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,320
Oh, God. Oh...

465
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,920
No!

466
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,200
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

467
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,200
Shrek! Hold still!

468
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,040
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.

469
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,040
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

470
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,440
Puss... in Boots!

471
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
I'll kill that cat!

472
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,200
Ah-ha-ha!

473
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,040
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

474
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,880
What should we do with him?

475
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,160
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

476
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,520
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!

477
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,200
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Senor.

478
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,920
I was doing it only for my family.

479
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,840
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!

480
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,280
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...

481
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

482
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,480
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

483
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,400
The rich King? Si.

484
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,040
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

485
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,280
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

486
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,720
Gee, thanks.

487
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,000
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

488
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,440
That's what the King said.

489
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,960
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question
was directed at me.

490
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,880
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'd do anything for her.

491
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,000
Well, it's not like
I wouldn't change if I could.

492
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,960
I just... I just wish
I could make her happy.

493
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,480
Hold the phone...

494
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,040
"Happiness."

495
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,880
"A tear drop away."

496
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,640
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

497
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,240
Aw, man, where do I begin?

498
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,440
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

499
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,120
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

500
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,120
Then they got drunk and start beating me
with a stick, going "Pinata!!"

501
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,520
What is a pinata, anyway?

502
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,880
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

503
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,320
Don't go projecting on me.

504
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,440
I know you're feeling bad,
but you got to...

505
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,560
Aaaahhh!

506
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,680
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

507
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
What? Is it on? Is it on?

508
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,520
This is Fairy Godmother.

509
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,760
I'm either away
from my desk or with a client.

510
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,160
But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you an appointment.

511
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,960
Have a "happy ever after."

512
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,240
Oh...

513
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,320
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

514
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,760
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

515
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,240
# Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!
We're on the move!

516
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,720
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

517
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,520
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life

518
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,400
as you have spared me mine.

519
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,600
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

520
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,480
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

521
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,200
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...

522
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,080
in his wee little boots.

523
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,240
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

524
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,040
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

525
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,920
Ahh!

526
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,760
Listen. He's purring!

527
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,760
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

528
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,000
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

529
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,240
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

530
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,840
Shrek!

531
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,360
Shrek?

532
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,280
They're both festive, aren't they?

533
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,160
What do you think, Harold?

534
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,400
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.

535
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,880
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

536
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,240
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.

537
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,560
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

538
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,480
Mom. Dad.

539
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,000
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

540
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,640
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

541
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,400
I haven't.
You should ask your father.

542
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,920
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

543
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,360
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...

544
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,800
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

545
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,880
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

546
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,560
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

547
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,600
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.

548
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice... mud hole to cool down in.

549
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,600
You know, after your
little spat last night.

550
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,880
Oh. You heard that, huh?

551
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,560
The whole kingdom heard you.

552
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,360
I mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be...

553
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,840
well, a bit of a brute.

554
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

555
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,280
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

556
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,880
Shrek loves me for who I am.

557
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,480
I would think you'd be happy for me.

558
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,840
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

559
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,080
Maybe you should do the same.

560
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,600
No, really?

561
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,400
Shh...

562
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,760
Oh...

563
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,280
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

564
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,160
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

565
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,560
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

566
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,160
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!

567
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,760
He makes me laugh.

568
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,160
Hi. I'm here to see the...

569
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,120
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

570
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,080
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

571
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,440
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

572
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,160
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

573
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,320
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

574
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,360
The union?

575
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,640
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

576
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,360
Oh! Oh, right.

577
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,400
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

578
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,000
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.

579
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,680
They don't even have dental.

580
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay, we'll just have
a look around.

581
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,200
Oh. By the way.

582
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,480
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

583
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,480
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

584
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,720
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

585
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,600
A drop of desire.

586
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,360
Naughty!

587
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,120
A pinch of passion.

588
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,360
And just a hint of...

589
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,080
lust!

590
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,400
- Excuse me.

591
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,080
Sorry to barge in like this...

592
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,160
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

593
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,000
Well, it seems
that Fiona's not exactly happy.

594
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,360
Oh-ho-ho!

595
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,920
And there's some question
as to why that is?

596
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,840
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

597
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,200
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.

598
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...

599
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,520
No ogres!

600
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,960
Let's see. Snow White.

601
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,640
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.

602
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,880
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

603
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

604
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,880
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

605
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,520
No, no, no, no, no!

606
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,800
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

607
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,440
All right, look, lady!

608
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,040
Don't you point...
those dirty green sausages at me!

609
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,120
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

610
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
Oh! Sorry.

611
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,680
Ah... that's okay.

612
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,000
We were just leaving.

613
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,600
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

614
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,400
Just... go.

615
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,760
Come on, guys.

616
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,800
TGIF, eh, buddy?

617
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,320
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

618
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,560
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!

619
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,520
Man, that stinks!

620
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,680
You don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses.

621
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,880
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!

622
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Already our minds are becoming one.

623
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,680
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

624
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,320
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

625
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,480
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

626
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,720
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

627
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,800
No problema, boss.
In one of my nine lives,

628
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,640
I was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.

629
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,960
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

630
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,360
Shrek, are you off your nut?

631
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,000
Donkey, keep watch.

632
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,920
Keep watch?
Yeah, I'll keep watch.

633
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,920
I'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

634
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,800
I'll laugh, too.
I'll be giggling to myself.

635
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,520
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?

636
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,480
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution
for marital problems.

637
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,400
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.

638
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,800
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try "handsome."

639
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,160
Sorry. No handsome.

640
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,280
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

641
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,400
Well, what does it do?

642
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,680
It says "Beauty Divine."

643
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,000
In some cultures, donkeys are revered
as the wisest of creatures.

644
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,560
Especially us talking ones.

645
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,680
Donkey!

646
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,080
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

647
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,520
Can we get on with this?

648
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,200
Hurry!

649
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,840
Nice catch, Donkey!

650
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,840
Finally! A good use for your mouth.

651
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,080
Come on!

652
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,360
# You spurn my natural emotions

653
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,080
# You make me feel like dirt
and I'm hurt

654
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,680
# And if I start a commotion

655
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,200
# I run the risk of losing you
and that's worse

656
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,240
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

657
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,760
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

658
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,000
# In love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

659
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,640
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

660
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,320
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

661
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,800
# With someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

662
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,960
# Fallen in love with

663
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,560
# Ever fallen in love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with #

664
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,800
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

665
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,520
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

666
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,840
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

667
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,200
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

668
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,320
Whoa, what happened here?

669
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,360
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?

670
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,840
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

671
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,240
I will smite him where he stands!

672
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,160
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

673
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,560
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

674
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,160
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

675
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,160
Pardon. Um...

676
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,320
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

677
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
What?

678
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,360
Oh...

679
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,320
I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

680
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,560
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

681
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,160
"For you and your true love.

682
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,840
"If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

683
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,640
"Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine."

684
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,280
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

685
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,760
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

686
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,680
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

687
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,040
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?

688
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,880
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

689
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,160
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

690
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,160
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

691
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,080
allow me to take the first sip.

692
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,480
It would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

693
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,600
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

694
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,200
If there'll be any animal testing,
I'll do it.

695
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,200
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

696
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,000
How do you feel?

697
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,120
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

698
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,240
You still look like an ass to me.

699
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,240
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

700
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,880
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?

701
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,480
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.

702
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,400
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.

703
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,120
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!

704
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,480
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!

705
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,920
But I love Fiona more.

706
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,000
Shrek, no! Wait!

707
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,520
Got to be... I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

708
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,280
Maybe it's a dud.

709
00:47:59,360 --> 00:47:59,720
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

710
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,280
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

711
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,240
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.

712
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,480
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die!

713
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,760
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

714
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
I'm melting!

715
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,800
It's just the rain, Donkey.

716
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,080
Oh.

717
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,680
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy

718
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,280
and Fiona's father hired
a sleazy hitman to whack you.

719
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,240
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

720
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,320
# The sun'll come out...

721
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,120
# Tomorrow

722
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,760
# Bet your bottom... #

723
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,640
Bet my bottom?

724
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm coming, Elizabeth!

725
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,680
Donkey?

726
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,560
Are you all right?

727
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,360
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?

728
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,680
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

729
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,440
What is it, darling?

730
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,040
Dad...

731
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,360
I've been thinking
about what you said.

732
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,120
And I'm going to set things right.

733
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,640
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.

734
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,320
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

735
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,080
I'm going to go out and find him.

736
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,080
And then we'll go back
to the swamp where we belong.

737
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,880
Fiona, please!

738
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,840
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

739
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,800
Fiona!

740
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,720
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

741
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,480
Good morning, sleepyhead.

742
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,040
Good morning!

743
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,640
We love your kitty!

744
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,280
- Oh... My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.

745
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,880
Thanks.

746
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,880
Uhh!

747
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,800
Aahh!

748
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,840
Oh...

749
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,120
A cute button nose?

750
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,120
Thick, wavy locks?

751
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,960
Taut, round buttocks?

752
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,200
I'm... I'm...

753
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,560
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.

754
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,240
I'm Jill. What's your name?

755
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,320
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

756
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,600
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.

757
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,320
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.

758
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:39,840
Get in line.

759
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,920
Get in line.

760
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,800
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?

761
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,560
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!

762
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,600
I can whinny.

763
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,720
I can count.

764
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,880
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!

765
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,480
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

766
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,640
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."

767
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,720
Pah!

768
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,120
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping.

769
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,680
"Not intended for heart patients
or those with... nervous disorders."

770
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,720
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah!

771
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,840
What?

772
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,400
Senor? "To make the effects
of this potion permanent,

773
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,880
"the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight."

774
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,160
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?

775
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,960
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.

776
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,480
I'll be true... enough.

777
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,880
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.

778
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,960
Oh...

779
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,480
And take it from me, Boss.

780
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,560
You are going to have
one satisfied Princess.

781
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,120
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

782
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,600
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...

783
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,600
- Easy.
...cantankerous, foul,

784
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,360
angry ogre you always been.

785
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,520
And you're still the same
annoying donkey.

786
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,120
- Yeah.

787
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,680
Well...

788
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,960
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

789
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,920
First things first.

790
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,440
- We need to get you out of those clothes.

791
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,560
- Ready?
- Ready!

792
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,240
- Driver, stop!

793
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,320
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

794
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,040
I'm blind! Tell the truth.

795
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,760
Will I ever play the violin again?

796
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,480
You poor creature!

797
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,720
Is there anything
I can do for you?

798
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,920
Well, I guess there is one thing.

799
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,840
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

800
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,960
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

801
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,760
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?

802
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,560
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.

803
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,000
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

804
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,600
# Oh, yeah

805
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,160
# Turn and face the strange

806
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
# Ch-Ch-Changes

807
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,040
# Don't wanna be a richer one

808
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,800
# Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

809
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,360
# Turn and face the strange

810
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,280
# Ch-Ch-Changes

811
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,240
# Just gonna have to be
a different man

812
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,680
# Time may change me

813
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,760
# But I can't trace time

814
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,920
Halt!

815
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,360
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

816
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,960
# Still don't know what
I was looking for

817
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:59,320
# And my time was running wild,
a million dead-end streets

818
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,360
# Every time I thought
I'd got it made

819
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,960
# It seemed the taste
was not so sweet

820
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,960
- # Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

821
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,560
# Turn and face the strange

822
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,120
- Shrek?
- # Ch-Ch-Changes

823
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,800
# Don't wanna be a richer one

824
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,560
# Time may change me

825
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,120
# But I can't trace time

826
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,160
Fiona?

827
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,200
Hello, handsome.

828
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,240
Shrek!

829
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,560
- Princess!
- Donkey?

830
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,680
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

831
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,960
What potion?

832
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,120
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

833
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,280
Now, we're sexy!

834
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,600
Shrek?

835
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,160
For you, baby... I could be.

836
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,440
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

837
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,760
He went inside looking for you.

838
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,480
Shrek?

839
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,920
Fiona! Fiona!

840
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,840
You want to dance, pretty boy?

841
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,080
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

842
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,320
Fiona?

843
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,840
Shrek?

844
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,640
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

845
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,320
What happened to your voice?

846
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,360
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

847
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,960
But not the way I feel about you.

848
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,440
Fiona?

849
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,040
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

850
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,800
Dad. I was so hoping
you'd approve.

851
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,320
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

852
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,720
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

853
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,160
but, well, what do you think?

854
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,840
Fiona! Fiona!

855
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,000
Fiona!

856
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,920
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

857
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,400
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

858
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,120
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

859
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,960
I just wanted her to be happy.

860
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,280
And now she can be.

861
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,240
Oh, sweetheart.

862
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,040
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

863
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,000
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.

864
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,240
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

865
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,280
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

866
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,240
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

867
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,080
But...

868
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,600
I love her.

869
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,400
If you really love her...

870
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,440
you'll let her go.

871
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,160
Shrek?

872
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,280
Senor.

873
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,200
What's going on?
Where are you going?

874
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,440
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

875
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,320
# People just ain't no good

876
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,280
# I think that's well understood

877
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,920
There you go, boys.

878
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,880
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

879
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,280
Hey. Why the long face?

880
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,720
It was all just a stupid mistake.

881
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,280
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

882
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,240
I hate Mondays.

883
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,800
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

884
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,400
What choice do I have?

885
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,800
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

886
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,920
Come on. Is he really
that good-Iooking?

887
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,360
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

888
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,520
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

889
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,040
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

890
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,320
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

891
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,800
Look, guys.
It's for the best.

892
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,240
Mom and Dad approve,

893
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,520
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

894
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,400
Everybody wins.

895
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,600
Except for you.

896
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,840
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

897
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,200
Aye.

898
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,640
And that's why
I have to let her go.

899
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,360
Excuse me, is she here?

900
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,480
She's, uh... in the back.

901
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,440
Oh, hello again.

902
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,560
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

903
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,760
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

904
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:51,400
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

905
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,840
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

906
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,720
I mean,
how charming can I be

907
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,080
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

908
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,160
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

909
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,440
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

910
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:08,680
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

911
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,800
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!

912
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,120
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

913
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,080
which will be Charming.

914
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,000
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

915
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,360
I can't. I won't do it.

916
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,960
Oh, yes, you will.

917
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,480
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

918
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,000
And I can take it away
just as easily.

919
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,120
Is that what you want? Is it?

920
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,480
- No.
- Good boy.

921
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,200
Now, we have to go.

922
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,440
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

923
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,680
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

924
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,480
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

925
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,120
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

926
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,920
Mother?

927
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,040
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

928
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,080
The ogre!

929
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,760
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

930
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,200
(Announcer) The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus

931
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,520
here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!

932
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,520
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

933
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,320
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

934
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,240
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

935
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,720
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

936
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,720
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

937
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,080
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

938
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,680
What the heck are the crumbs for?

939
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,680
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

940
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,280
- Oh, aren't they adorable!

941
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,360
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

942
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,320
Tired old thing.

943
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,800
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

944
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,880
Oh. It's the one, it's the only...

945
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,440
It's the Fairy Godmother!

946
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,640
Hello, Far, Far Away!

947
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
Can I get a whoop whoop?

948
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,400
May all your endings be happy and...

949
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,400
Well, you know the rest!

950
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,320
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

951
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,240
after these messages.

952
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,840
I hate these ball shows.

953
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,960
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!

954
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,520
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

955
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,160
Whizzes on you guys.

956
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,240
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

957
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,480
No, to your left. Your left!

958
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,480
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!

959
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,840
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

960
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,920
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

961
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,600
their "devil may mare" attitudes
just won't fly.

962
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,520
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

963
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,600
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

964
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,640
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!

965
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,120
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?

966
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,040
You capitalist pig dogs!

967
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,960
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

968
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,000
Find Princess Fiona!

969
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,680
I'm a donkey!

970
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,320
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!

971
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,840
Quick! Rewind it!

972
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,200
I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!

973
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,920
Darling?

974
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,800
Ah. I thought I might
find you here.

975
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,320
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

976
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,800
I'm not going.

977
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,760
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

978
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,640
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

979
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,360
I mean, look at him.

980
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,000
Yes, he is a bit different,

981
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,040
but people change
for the ones they love.

982
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,160
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

983
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,920
Change?

984
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,120
He's completely lost his mind!

985
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:11,600
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

986
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,440
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

987
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,640
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

988
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,680
I'd give anything to have him back.

989
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,680
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

990
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,640
Otherwise I'm up all night.

991
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,800
Thanks.

992
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,280
I got to get out of here!

993
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,600
I got to get out of here!

994
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,240
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

995
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,760
What about my Miranda rights?

996
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,480
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.

997
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,680
Nobody said I have the right
to remain silent!

998
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,200
You have the right to remain silent.

999
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,760
What you lack is the capacity.

1000
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,200
I must hold on before I, too,
go totally mad.

1001
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,480
Shrek? Donkey?

1002
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,840
Too late.

1003
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,080
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!

1004
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,320
Oh...

1005
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,160
Fire in ze hole!

1006
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,520
Look out below!

1007
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,760
Quick! Tell a lie!

1008
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,440
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!

1009
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,440
Say something crazy like
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"

1010
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,520
I am wearing ladies' underwear.

1011
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,720
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!

1012
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,880
It looks like you
most certainly am are!

1013
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,440
- I am not!
- What kind?

1014
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,000
- It's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!

1015
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,400
- Are not.
- Are too!

1016
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,120
- Are not!
- Are too!

1017
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,840
Here we go. Hang tight.

1018
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,080
Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!

1019
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,680
Ow!

1020
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,160
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

1021
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,280
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

1022
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,240
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!

1023
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,040
We've got to stop that kiss!

1024
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,880
I thought you was going
to let her go.

1025
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,200
I was, but I can't let them
do this to Fiona.

1026
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,320
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

1027
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,120
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.

1028
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,080
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!

1029
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:38,760
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

1030
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,520
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

1031
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,920
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

1032
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,400
Because we're gonna need flour.

1033
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,360
Lots and lots of flour.

1034
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,920
Gingy!

1035
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,240
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

1036
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,000
It's alive!

1037
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,480
Run, run, run,
as fast you can!

1038
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,440
Go, baby, go!

1039
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,720
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

1040
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,040
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

1041
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,080
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

1042
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,880
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

1043
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,360
Pretty pony wants to play
at the castle!

1044
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,040
Pretty pony.

1045
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,520
Ladies and gentlemen.

1046
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:05,160
Presenting Princess Fiona
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

1047
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,560
Shrek, what are you doing?

1048
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,720
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

1049
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,640
Is that glitter on your lips?

1050
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,520
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?

1051
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,240
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

1052
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,200
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

1053
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,680
Ladies and gentlemen.

1054
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,920
I'd like to dedicate this song to...

1055
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,320
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

1056
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,000
Fiona, my Princess.

1057
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,520
Will you honor me with a dance?

1058
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,400
# Where have all the good men gone

1059
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,240
# And where are all the gods?

1060
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,360
Dance!

1061
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,040
# Where's the streetwise Hercules

1062
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,600
# To fight the rising odds?

1063
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,040
Since when do you dance?

1064
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,920
Fiona, my dearest,
if there's one thing I know,

1065
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,160
it's that love is full of surprises.

1066
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,680
# Late at night I toss and I turn

1067
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,080
# And I dream of what I need

1068
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,160
Hit it!

1069
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,360
# I need a hero

1070
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,320
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

1071
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,400
Man the catapults!

1072
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,080
Aim! Fire!

1073
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,160
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!

1074
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,360
Not the gumdrop button!

1075
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,200
Incoming!

1076
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,840
Ha-ha! All right!

1077
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:06,160
# Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy

1078
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,800
Go, Mongo! Go!

1079
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,440
Man the cauldrons!

1080
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,000
After you, Mongo.

1081
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,680
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!

1082
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,640
Shrek!

1083
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,040
More heat, less foam!

1084
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,800
# Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above

1085
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,720
# Out where the lightning
Splits the sea

1086
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:46,440
# I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me

1087
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,080
Heave! Ho!

1088
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,360
No...!

1089
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,080
Come on!

1090
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,360
Look out!

1091
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,000
- Be good.

1092
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,680
He needs me!
Let me go!

1093
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,520
Donkey!

1094
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,800
Puss!

1095
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,080
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

1096
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,120
Today, I repay my debt.

1097
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,440
Aww...

1098
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,240
On guard!

1099
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,320
# He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

1100
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,800
# And he's gotta be fresh
From the fight

1101
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,680
- # I need a hero #
- Stop!

1102
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,360
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?

1103
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,600
You couldn't just go back to your swamp
and leave well enough alone.

1104
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,840
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

1105
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,960
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

1106
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,720
I see London! I see France!

1107
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,080
Whah!

1108
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,680
I'm a real boy!

1109
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,400
Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!

1110
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,040
Catch!

1111
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,320
Donkey!

1112
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,880
Oh!

1113
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,840
I'm a real boy. Aah!

1114
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,360
Oh!

1115
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,480
- Ha!
- Ah.

1116
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,200
That's mine!

1117
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,680
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

1118
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,320
And Donkey!

1119
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,280
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

1120
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,440
No!

1121
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,280
- Hi-ya!

1122
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,600
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

1123
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:57,480
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

1124
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,280
Well, I guess I gave her
the wrong tea.

1125
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,680
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

1126
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,920
I told you.

1127
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Ogres don't live happily ever after.

1128
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,200
Woo!

1129
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:22,960
Ha!

1130
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,480
Oh, Dad!

1131
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,080
- Is he...?
- Yup.

1132
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,120
He croaked.

1133
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,400
Harold?

1134
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,400
Dad?

1135
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,640
I'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

1136
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,840
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!

1137
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,080
No, no, he's right.
I'm sorry.

1138
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,040
To both of you.

1139
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,960
I only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

1140
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,080
But I can see now...

1141
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,720
she already has it.

1142
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,760
Shrek, Fiona...

1143
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,520
Will you accept
an old frog's apologies...

1144
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,280
and my blessing?

1145
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,560
Harold?
I'm sorry, Lillian.

1146
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,000
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

1147
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,280
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

1148
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,240
warts and all.

1149
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,240
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

1150
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,400
Midnight!

1151
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,960
Fiona. Is this what you want?

1152
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,880
To be this way forever?

1153
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,520
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

1154
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,200
we can stay like this.

1155
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,120
You'd do that?

1156
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,080
- For me?
- Yes.

1157
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,240
I want what any princess wants.

1158
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,920
To live happily ever after...

1159
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,400
with the ogre I married.

1160
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,200
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!

1161
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,280
You cannot make me cry!

1162
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,840
Whoa!

1163
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,560
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.

1164
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,320
Oh, no.

1165
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:12,400
Hey. You still look like
a noble steed to me.

1166
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,960
Now, where were we?

1167
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,240
Oh. I remember.

1168
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,920
Hey! Isn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

1169
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,560
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

1170
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,920
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

1171
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,640
# She's into superstitions

1172
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,240
# Black cats and voodoo dolls

1173
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,880
- Sing it, Puss!
- # I feel a premonition

1174
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,320
# That girl's gonna make me fall

1175
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
Here we go!

1176
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,520
# She's into new sensations

1177
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,960
# New kicks in the candlelight

1178
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,560
# She's got a new addiction

1179
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,000
# For every day and night

1180
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,200
# She'll make you take your clothes off

1181
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,320
# And go dancing in the rain

1182
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,360
# She'll make you live her crazy life

1183
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,840
# But she'll take away your pain

1184
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,240
# Like a bullet to your brain

1185
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,720
# Upside inside out

1186
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,960
# Living la vida loca

1187
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,920
Hey gorgeous!

1188
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,520
# Living la vida loca

1189
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,840
# Her lips are devil red

1190
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,160
# And her skin's the color of mocha

1191
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,040
# She will wear you out

1192
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,680
- # Living la vida loca
- She livin' it loca!

1193
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,200
# Living la vida loca

1194
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,840
- Say it one more time now!
- # Living the vida loca

1195
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,680
Hey, Donkey, that's Spanish!

1196
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,200
# She'll push and pull you down

1197
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,760
# Living la vida loca

1198
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,400
# She will wear you out

1199
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,880
# Living la vida loca

1200
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,040
# Living la vida loca

1201
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,320
# She'll push and pull you down

1202
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,720
# Living the vida loca

1203
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,200
# Her lips are devil red

01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,920
# Living la vida loca

01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,840
# Living la vida loca #

1210
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,080
# All by myself

1211
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,520
# All by myself

1212
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,000
# Don't wanna be

1213
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:50,480
# All by myself anymore... #

1214
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,000
Amigo, we are off
to the Kit-Kat Club.

1215
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,360
Come on, join us.

1216
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,320
Thanks, compadre.
I'm... I'm not in the mood.

1217
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,680
We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!

1218
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,320
Hey, baby!

1219
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,640
Hey, that's my girl!
Yeah! All right!

1220
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,800
Baby, where you been?

1221
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,040
- I'm sorry, too.

1222
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,720
I should've stayed.
But Shrek had this thing he had to do.

1223
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,280
What? Say it one more time.

1224
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,880
What you talking about?
Are you serious?

1225
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,080
- Papa!

1226
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,720
Look at our little mutant babies!

1227
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,200
I got to get a job.

1228
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,160
I got to get a job.
