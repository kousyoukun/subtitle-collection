Dear Diary,,,

Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

467
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:05,027
but Dad says I can't go,
He never lets me out after sunset,

468
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,661
Dad says I'm going away for a while,

469
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,100
Must be like some finishing school,

470
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:13,971
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

471
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,769
my Prince Charming will rescue me
from my tower

472
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,402

00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:46,336
Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

480
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:52,002
No, no. I Was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.

481
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:57,140
I Was hoping you'd Iet me apologiZe
for my despicable behavior earlier.

482
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,684
- Okay...
- I don't knoW What came over me.

483
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:03,210
Do you suppose We could pretend
it never happened and start over...

484
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,348
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- PIease. Call me Dad.

Dad. We both acted Iike ogres.

486
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,154
Maybe We just need some time
to get to knoW each other.

487
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:18,693
Excellent idea! I Was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

488
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,796
A Iittle father-son time?

You Were the one Who said
not to stop for directions.

Oh, great. My one chance

Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question
Was directed at me.

First there Was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

Then this fool had a party and he have

Then they got drunk and start beating me
With a stick, going "Pinata!!"

What is a pinata, anyway?

No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And Well...

927
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:02,474
NoW, We're sexy!

928
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:04,839
Shrek?

929
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:05,904
[purrs]

930
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:11,681
For you, baby... I could be.

931
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,086
- Yeah, you Wish.
- Donkey, Where is Shrek?

932
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,488
He Went inside Iooking for you.

933
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:19,351
Shrek?

934
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,925
Fiona! Fiona!

935
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,029
You Want to dance, pretty boy?

936
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,537
Are you going so soon?
Don't you Want to see your Wife?

937
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:35,867
Fiona?

938
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:39,543
Shrek?

939
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:42,449
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

940
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,214
What happened to your voice?

941
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:48,418
The potion changed
a Iot of things, Fiona.

942
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:51,120
But not the Way I feel about you.

943
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,662
Fiona?

944
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,431
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

945
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,334
[Iaughs] Dad. I Was so hoping
you'd approve.

946
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:04,033
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

947
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:07,544
I knoW you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

948
00:59:07,678 --> 00:59:10,112
but, Well, What do you think?

949
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,047
[Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona!

950
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,383
Fiona!

951
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:24,450
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

952
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:28,055
Oh, shoot! I don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

953
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:29,656
[sighs deeply]

954
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:34,068
Don't you think you've already
messed her Iife up enough?

955
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,998
I just Wanted her to be happy.

956
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,406
And noW she can be.

957
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:41,467
Oh, sWeetheart.

958
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:45,413
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

959
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:49,543
But Iook at me.
Look What I've done for her.

960
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,919
It's time you stop Iiving
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

961
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:57,154
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

962
00:59:57,227 --> 01:00:01,254
That's something no amount
of potion Will ever change.

963
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,504
But...

964
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,097
I Iove her.

965
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:15,009
If you really Iove her...

966
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:17,138
you'II Iet her go.

967
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:18,282
[กำ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]

968
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,307
[กำ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]

969
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:23,076
Shrek?

970
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:24,245
Senor.

971
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:27,313
What's going on?
Where are you going?

972
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:37,967
You Wouldn't have had anything to do
With this, Would you, Harold?

973
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,234
กำ People just ain't no good

974
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:52,413
กำ I think that's well understood

975
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:54,144
There you go, boys.

976
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:56,186
Just Ieave the bottle, Doris.

977
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,653
Hey. Why the Iong face?

978
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:02,251
It Was all just a stupid mistake.

979
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:07,027
I never should have rescued her
from that toWer in the first place.

980
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,133
I hate Mondays.

981
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:14,864
I can't believe you'd Walk aWay from
the best thing that happened to you.

982
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,530
What choice do I have?

983
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:20,065
She Ioves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

984
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:22,237
Come on. Is he really
that good-Iooking?

985
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:24,803
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

986
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:28,079
He has a face that Iooks Iike
it Was carved by angels.

987
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:30,746
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You knoW...

988
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:34,188
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

989
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,953
Look, guys.
It's for the best.

990
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,430
Mom and Dad approve,

991
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:45,866
and Fiona gets the man
she's alWays dreamed of.

992
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:47,801
Everybody Wins.

993
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,101
Except for you.

994
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:53,473
I don't get it, Shrek.
You Iove Fiona.

995
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:54,909
Aye.

996
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:58,473
And that's Why
I have to Iet her go.

997
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:02,343
Excuse me, is she here?

998
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,580
She's, uh... in the back.

999
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:07,653
Oh, hello again.

1000
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,022
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

1001
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:18,431
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us doWn here, Harold.

1002
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:24,304
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
Warming up to Prince Charming.

1003
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:27,901
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

1004
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,842
I mean,
hoW charming can I be

1005
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,313
When I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

1006
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,441
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

1007
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:37,885
Perhaps it's best if We just
call the Whole thing off, okay?

1008
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:42,289
- [both] What?
- You can't force someone to fall in Iove!

1009
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:45,556
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!

1010
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:50,066
Have Fiona drink this and she'II fall in Iove
With the first man she kisses,

1011
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,101
Which Will be Charming.

1012
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:56,195
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

1013
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,673
I can't. I Won't do it.

1014
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:00,334
Oh, yes, you Will.

1015
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,005
If you remember, I helped you
With your happily ever after.

1016
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:07,642
And I can take it aWay
just as easily.

1017
01:03:07,718 --> 01:03:10,949
Is that What you Want? Is it?

1018
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:14,413
- No.
- Good boy.

1019
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:16,220
NoW, We have to go.

1020
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,557
I need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

1021
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:20,893
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

1022
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,797
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

1023
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,528
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

1024
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:27,433

Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!

Who's this? Who's this?

Oh. It's the one, it's the only...

Well, you knoW the rest!

01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,811
after these messages,

1050
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,506
I hate these ball shoWs.

1051
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:47,742
They bore me to tears.
FIip over to Wheel Of T orture!

1052
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:51,447
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,

01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:54,183
WhiZZes on you guys.

01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,384
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo Wing!

1057
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:08,437
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest, Requesting backup,

1058
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:10,598
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

1059
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:13,404
their "devil may mare" attitudes
just won't fly,

1060
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:18,542
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

1061
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,775
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!

1062
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,911
- We Warned you!
- OW! OW!

1063
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:26,455
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?

1064
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,514
You capitalist pig dogs!

1065
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:29,923
[shrieks]

1066
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,691
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

1067
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,859
Find Princess Fiona!

1068
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,630
I'm a donkey!

1069
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:43,366
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!

1070
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:46,008
Quick! ReWind it!

1071
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,501
I'm her husband, Shrek! OW!

1072
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:15,760
[knock on door]

1073
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,431
Darling?

1074
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:21,411
Ah. I thought I might
find you here.

1075
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:25,073
HoW about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

1076
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,647
I'm not going.

1077
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:30,743
The Whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

1078
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:34,780
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

1079
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,620
I mean, Iook at him.

1080
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,420
Yes, he is a bit different,

1081
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,558
