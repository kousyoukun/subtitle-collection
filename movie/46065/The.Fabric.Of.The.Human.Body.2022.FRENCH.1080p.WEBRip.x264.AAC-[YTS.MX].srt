3
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:39,029
BLACK - ARAB - BITCH
I FUCK ALL BITCHES

4
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,629
<i>Rondier,
is there a problem in the ER?</i>

5
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,189
<i>Yeah, there's a man without papers.</i>

6
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,389
<i>He won't budge,
he's on the floor drunk.</i>

7
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,269
<i>We're going to throw him out.</i>

8
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,709
<i>OK, coming.</i>

9
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,269
Yes, hello?

10
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:54,709
Yes? You paged me?

11
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:58,549
It's the ICU resident.

12
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,829
You need me to bring the patient
from the ortho unit?

13
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,629
OK, I'll bring him right over.

14
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,629
It's funny, this woman
already had renal cancer, right?

15
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,069
- Yes.
- She's had kidney cancer.

16
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,029
Oh yeah, it's her. Renal cancer.

17
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,629
She was obese
and has had bypass surgery.

18
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,789
- It seems like...
- Some people...

19
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:21,509
They're lightning rods!
They get it all...

20
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,229
She had a hematoma.
It bled, spontaneously.

21
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,309
A blood vessel suddenly ruptured.

22
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,909
Either because of an aneurysm
or because of age or...

23
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,749
And this was a horrible spot.
The brain is like a funnel.

24
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:40,229
And the hematoma was
in the smallest point of the brainstem,

25
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,949
the major command center.

26
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:44,389
And it's only 5 cm thick.

27
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:45,909
It's surgically inaccessible.

28
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:50,709
If they hadn't operated on the bruise,
they'd have redirected the CSF fluid.

29
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:53,349
So it wouldn't swell in the brain.

30
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,629
Basically,

31
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,701
she could be brain-dead

32
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:57,949
in 48 hours.

33
00:04:58,229 --> 00:04:59,589
It's a plumbing problem.

34
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:02,709
The surface fluid won't evacuate,
crushing her brain,

35
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,269
which still functions.

36
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:09,069
But its connection
with the rest of the body doesn't.

37
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:10,749
Like locked-in syndrome.

38
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,509
You know,
when someone is paralyzed?

39
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,949
Their eyes are open,
they hear, see,

40
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,349
but have lost the connection.

41
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:19,069
But hers is worse,
because it's larger.

42
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,789
She could be brain-dead in 48 hours.

43
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,469
Otherwise,
we'll extubate her on Monday.

44
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,669
And...?

45
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,429
And take her off assisted breathing,

46
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:30,429
but she can't breathe on her own,
so she'll die.

47
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:32,029
Her family understands.

48
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:34,589
Her daughter is a doctor, which helps.

49
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:37,469
We're also thinking of
potential organ donations.

50
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,629
But we're in no rush
for anyone to die.

51
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,789
Let's give it the weekend.

52
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:46,429
If she isn't brain-dead
in the next 48 hours,

53
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:48,309
she doesn't stand a chance.

54
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,389
If I'm ever locked-in,
pull the plug, I beg you!

55
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,229
Yes.

56
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:02,069
We've had a young tetraplegic in here
for 118 days now.

57
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:05,549
He went to the café
for the first time today.

58
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:10,229
118 days is long for a 25-year-old.

59
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,189
But he seems in good spirits.
He's a fighter. Still...

60
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,229
his life was turned upside-down.

61
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,909
From a car accident.

62
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,869
It's why we work in the ICU,
we can't get attached.

63
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,469
Most patients
only stay here about 10 days.

64
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,949
Having a patient
for 117 days is rare.

65
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:34,589
Yes?

66
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:38,829
Perfect.

67
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,829
OK. See you later, Nazim.

68
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:45,189
A patient got out of the O.R.
He's coming to the ICU.

69
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:46,629
It's a sad case.

70
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,669
He's a young 22-year-old
with colon cancer...

71
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:51,789
in palliative care.

72
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:52,989
It's sad.

73
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:56,989
At least we're improving
the last days he has left to live.

74
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,749
But it's untreatable.

75
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,549
He has a huge tumor
that can't be removed

76
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,309
in the colon.

77
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,189
And nodes in his peritoneum

78
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,589
are crushing
what's left of his intestine.

79
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:09,469
He probably weighs about 35 kilos.

80
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:10,589
In two weeks,

81
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,189
another node will crush
another part of the tube and...

82
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:16,549
I'm not religious or crazy,

83
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,309
but I believe in karma.

84
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,829
Some people drink, smoke,
and live to excess.

85
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,229
And live to be 100.

86
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,549
And you have
21-year-old kids like him...

87
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:29,389
He had a stomach ache
6 months ago and now...

88
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,949
No luck.

89
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,429
I don't know how many deaths
we've had in room 5...

90
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,509
Certain rooms,
for some strange reason...

91
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,029
- It's pure chance.
- It's true, room 5...

92
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,869
Yesterday, no, today,
someone died.

93
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,349
She's going to die.

94
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,229
She'll be replaced by someone else.

95
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,429
Some rooms are like that.

96
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,749
They're cursed.

97
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,509
That's why there's no room 13.

98
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,349
It's silly, but...

99
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,589
Working in the ICU

100
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:02,989
you develop a carpe diem attitude
because of the horrors you see.

101
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,749
You try to enjoy life.

102
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,709
And you have a very clear vision
on death and dying.

103
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:10,949
"What will be will be."

104
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:13,109
I do what I can for families,

105
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,869
but sometimes
I make them wait 1.5 hours

106
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,709
because I want to eat or smoke...

107
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,469
It's abuse.

108
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:21,989
Not deliberate abuse.

109
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:25,069
Thankfully, for most medics,
except for a few crazy ones,

110
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:26,509
it's never intentional.

111
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:29,749
We don't do it
to hurt the patients, but...

112
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:31,949
It drives me crazy.

113
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,229
In recovery,
if a patient's family calls,

114
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,349
I put the patient on the phone
whenever I can.

115
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:38,789
To talk with their family.

116
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:42,069
That alone is worth
all the medical briefs on earth.

117
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,589
The wife we saw earlier
had to wait 1.5 hours this morning.

118
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:49,229
I was caring for her husband,
I was busy, but...

119
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,949
there was no one there, poor lady.

120
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:53,789
No secretary at the reception.

121
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,509
She was all alone.

122
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:59,189
Imagine if I'd told her he'd died.

123
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:01,949
1.5 hours! It's just horrible.

124
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:04,829
We used to have a medical secretary

125
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,949
at the reception
to bring them water, to...

126
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:11,109
to give them updates:
"The doctors are with him."

127
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,709
But this lady was alone.

128
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,389
She'd see us running around.

129
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,349
It isn't right. It just isn't.

130
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:23,029
It's awful.
No-one left at the reception.

131
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,669
It's not the current policy.

132
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:28,669
It's about budget cutbacks,
downsizing personnel.

133
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,909
At night, you'll have
one hospital nurse for 20 patients.

134
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,549
Conditions are going downhill.

135
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:42,349
For four years,
this is the fifth year now,

136
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,829
we've been the top polytrauma center
in Île-de-France.

137
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:49,109
We're the number one center
in the capital, Paris.

138
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,749
And we get nothing.
We never get credit.

139
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:52,909
Not financially,

140
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:57,189
but for the sleepless nights spent
checking in injured patients,

141
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:01,429
because it can be
physically and emotionally exhausting.

142
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:05,109
Whether we have 0 or 600 patients,
it's all the same.

143
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,389
We just get an email saying:
"That's nice."

144
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:09,909
Sure, it's nice.

145
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:12,429
We didn't sleep for 320 nights.

146
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:13,949
But yeah, nice.

147
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,909
You stay up night after night

148
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:19,709
just to be given a badge
or a pen from the Public Hospitals.

149
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,229
- Quentin, go sleep.
- I was going to ask.

150
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:29,829
Go on, no worries.

151
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:32,549
- Page if you need me.
- Yeah? OK.

152
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,269
- Tomorrow at 8?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:36,829
To check the charts?

154
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:39,349
7:30 to look over
the 6 o'clock check-ups?

155
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,869
We'll call you if anything happens.

156
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:43,389
Goodnight, Quentin.

157
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:47,629
Ready to do the rounds?

158
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:39,789
I can feel it.

159
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,229
Does it hurt?

160
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,709
Or can you just tell
I'm doing something?

161
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,469
A bit of both.

162
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:48,509
It isn't very pleasant.

163
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,669
I'm pressing down hard.

164
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:56,229
Like I just told you,
I'm in the external cortical bone.

165
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:57,989
It's quite dense.

166
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:00,629
I'm using a self-tapping screw.

167
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,589
I hear noises too...

168
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,349
It's holding in place.

169
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,829
I'll add some smaller screws
to keep it in place.

170
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,669
I liked playing Meccano
when I was a kid.

171
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,709
- Me too.
- Not much has changed.

172
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,949
Yeah, it's a fun...

173
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,949
It's a really good game.

174
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,269
I've liked playing Meccano
since I was four.

175
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:36,189
Same here.

176
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:39,909
It forged my love of mechanics.

177
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,789
Aren't you a chemist?

178
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:44,389
Yes, but...

179
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:46,389
my passion and hobby...

180
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:48,429
Wow, it hurts a lot!

181
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,349
This one hurt?

182
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,069
Is the pain going away?

183
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,309
Yeah...

184
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,469
A bit.

185
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,309
I'd say 4 or 5.

186
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,349
Maybe it's too close.

187
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,949
Are you OK?

188
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,869
Kind of.

189
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:18,429
It hurt when I pushed?

190
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:21,189
Yes, I can really feel it.

191
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,749
There, I'm done.

192
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,069
We have a little problem
with the lens.

193
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:56,029
There's a little crescent
that's not right.

194
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:12,869
There seems to be another membrane here.

195
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,789
It's pretty unusual.

196
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:19,069
I think I see the pituitary gland.

197
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,869
It's like cotton candy.

198
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:57,629
Now you remove the tiny membrane.

199
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,189
And then...

200
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:00,709
you grab this.

201
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,349
There we go! Wonderful.

202
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:06,269
"Nice move", as they say.

203
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:09,589
Exactly! You just peel it off.

204
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:15,149
And now it's moving a lot more.

205
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:17,189
See? It's flowing now.

206
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:23,149
Try to remove some more.

207
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,309
It's a bit unusual.

208
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:36,869
That bit is really teasing you.

209
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:45,589
Well done.

210
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,669
It's a game! It's a game.

211
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:52,309
Let's take another look inside?

212
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,989
Hello? Turn on the light, please.

213
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:00,069
We saw the flap, possibly.

214
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,429
We can tell that...

215
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,349
the operation is going fine.

216
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:07,469
We saw the clivus' dura mater,
the basilar artery,

217
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,829
and that the edges
are beating properly.

218
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:13,789
So the ventriculostomy
is functioning well.

219
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:22,669
The structures are beating now,
but they weren't before.

220
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:31,309
We're now entering
the small cortical tunnel,

221
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:34,909
the little hole we made in the brain.

222
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:39,629
It isn't very deep, but it's real.

223
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,349
We're checking
we didn't cause too much bleeding.

224
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,069
It looks fine.

225
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:00,989
We'll start to see it
beating on the surface.

226
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,069
It isn't moving much now.

227
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,389
The closer we get to the cortex,
the harder it'll beat.

228
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,349
Now it's beating.

229
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,229
And it usually comes out...

230
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:15,509
And now we're outside.

231
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:21,629
There were quite a few blood vessels.

232
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,669
On the surface.

233
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,229
Oh yes.

234
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:30,509
And now our cortical chimney
is closing up.

235
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:31,709
Slowly.

236
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:13,909
Nurses in the O.R.
are also hair dressers.

237
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,869
Nice, right?

238
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,629
- Are you OK?
- Unfortunately, no.

239
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:38,149
My shoulders automatically tense up

240
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,349
the more...

241
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,709
the more I tense up.

242
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,789
I'm going to go. I'm going.

243
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:54,989
Goodbye.

244
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:01,709
Hurry up.

245
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,829
The lady is here.

246
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,909
She isn't nice.

247
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:13,749
Who?

248
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,829
Who isn't nice?

249
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,229
That lady...

250
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:22,349
I don't understand.

251
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,349
Yes, the lady. The lady there.

252
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:27,949
Which lady?

253
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:30,869
She's here.

254
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:32,629
Hurry up.

255
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,109
Please.

256
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:37,989
Hurry up.

257
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,389
Hurry.

258
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:45,509
You can stop if you want.
You don't need to hold her hand.

259
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:46,789
No.

260
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,309
You were told to hurry up.

261
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:56,549
You don't need to hurry.

262
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,229
Hello, ladies.

263
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,269
Are you going on a walk?

264
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,509
You're nice.

265
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:06,429
Thank you.

266
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:09,469
Thank you very much.

267
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,509
It's funny...

268
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:16,269
what you say
frankly doesn't affect me.

269
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,309
There's a lady sitting over there.
We know her.

270
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:22,989
Let's go see her.

271
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,709
The lady's here.

272
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,749
Can you hurry up, please?

273
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:31,589
Madam, can you hurry, please?

274
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,549
You should stop talking.

275
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:40,629
<i>I'll be the prettiest dancer
At the ball tonight</i>

276
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,029
The lady is here.

277
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:46,989
The lady is here.

278
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:48,269
Everything OK?

279
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:50,949
I'm going to get my uniform
for Monday.

280
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,309
She's the one who's very important.

281
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:56,309
The most important.

282
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:06,269
I'm waiting for my husband to come.

283
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,749
A man you used to know.

284
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:13,829
What time is it?

285
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,469
Move along, ladies.

286
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:19,509
- 11:30.
- 11:30?

287
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,229
He's going to arrive soon.

288
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:24,149
Roland is here.

289
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:26,549
My husband Richard is coming.

290
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:32,949
Roland's here.

291
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:39,149
You aren't nice.

292
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,109
Where are you off to?

293
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:44,789
We aren't going far.

294
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:48,269
Hurry up.

295
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,869
You need to hurry.

296
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,509
Hurry.

297
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:58,829
The gentleman is here.

298
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:09,269
Shut up. Shut up.

299
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,389
Shut up.

300
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,109
The lady isn't here.
The lady is there.

301
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:37,349
There?

302
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,109
The lady is here.

303
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,309
No, she isn't here.

304
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:46,749
She's nice.

305
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,469
Let's go sit.

306
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,989
Hurry up. Hurry.

307
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:01,989
She's nice.

308
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:06,949
Hurry.

309
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:21,469
Hurry up.

310
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:27,002
<i>Stand up!</i>

311
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,042
They told you to stand up.

312
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,549
- What?
- They told you to stand up.

313
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,069
Come on. Come.

314
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:38,389
Grandpa, shut up.

315
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:47,709
In the small intestine

316
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,069
there's no sign of...

317
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:53,149
atrophy.

318
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,549
It's on the boulevard.

319
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:23,189
Near Louis XIV's hunting pavilion.

320
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:28,869
The population's changed a lot.

321
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,909
Rent has gone up in Clichy.

322
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:38,349
We don't charge our tenants much.

323
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:39,949
How big is it?

324
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:44,389
90m2 for three tenants,

325
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:48,229
with a 10m2 terrace,
parking space, basement...

326
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:51,469
And we charge less than...

327
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,669
1,800 a month.

328
00:26:58,709 --> 00:26:59,869
But it's in Clichy.

329
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:02,629
It's fully equipped, brand-new.

330
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,949
In Paris, you'd get 50m2.

331
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:39,709
<i>Cortex.</i>

332
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,229
<i>Polish.</i>

333
00:28:55,389 --> 00:28:57,269
Can you still see the light?

334
00:28:58,189 --> 00:28:59,869
Three dots.

335
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:42,749
Look straight ahead, sir.

336
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,909
Turn down the light, please.

337
00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:54,909
It's on the machine-gun setting.
I can set it to...

338
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,709
The Kalashnikov setting? Whatever.

339
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:00,789
Try the ballistic setting.
See if it's better.

340
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:13,269
You know the difference
between a phallus and a penis?

341
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:16,989
The penis isn't erect
but the phallus is?

342
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:20,069
That's why they say "nice phallus".

343
00:35:20,629 --> 00:35:23,349
Lots of people have told me,
"You have a nice phallus!"

344
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,469
I'm going to stop here.

345
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:51,469
Because I'm tired.

346
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:55,029
This shit is so tiring.

347
00:35:57,229 --> 00:35:59,349
We should get organized to know if...

348
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:00,989
I don't know! Ask your boss.

349
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:03,749
I want to finish with this patient.
And to do that,

350
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:07,709
we need to get organized,
instead of asking questions.

351
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,989
It's exhausting to have to push people
all day long.

352
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:14,349
- You're overreacting.
- Am I?

353
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:15,821
Listen...

354
00:36:15,861 --> 00:36:20,189
You know, between two patients,
your crew is pretty fast.

355
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:23,869
- I know, I said so.
- Then don't say you have to push us.

356
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:27,269
I have to push everyone in the O.R.

357
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:28,749
Or we never finish!

358
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:31,189
One out of two Mondays,
we don't finish.

359
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:34,229
One Thursday out of two,
one Wednesday out of two...

360
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:36,472
Because the team isn't doing enough?

361
00:36:36,512 --> 00:36:37,568
I don't know.

362
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:39,288
Or is the schedule too tight?

363
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:42,629
I don't know!
There are no tight schedules.

364
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,269
A tight schedule...

365
00:36:47,149 --> 00:36:48,949
I need a vacation.

366
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,189
We're understaffed,
not enough nurses.

367
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:53,949
We aren't understaffed.

368
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:55,589
We have a thousand nurses.

369
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,669
They stand around smoking all day.

370
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:00,069
Oh stop it, just stop it.

371
00:37:00,229 --> 00:37:02,229
And I'm not understaffed?

372
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,469
I see 100 patients
and operate on 20 every week.

373
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:09,189
100 patients, 3 consultations a week.
I'm a robot.

374
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:12,389
- Eddy's alone in the afternoons.
- Oh, stop.

375
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:14,909
They could do 3 in the a.m.,
3 in the p.m.

376
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:18,189
The problem is the organization,
not us.

377
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:21,269
We only need two nurses for this unit.

378
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:23,789
How often does he end up alone?

379
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:27,029
Easy for you to say,
we're the ones making up for it.

380
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:30,469
In 5 years of surgical nursing,
I never had to clean up.

381
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:32,829
But since coming here,
I usually do it

382
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,189
because I see how they're overworked.

383
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:38,429
- Then hire some porters.
- Exactly!

384
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,389
We have 5 million unemployed people
in this country.

385
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:43,109
That's what I'm saying!

386
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:45,429
- We'll hire a porter.
- We agree.

387
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:47,269
Otherwise we can't operate.

388
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:51,229
But management just tells us
to use temp workers.

389
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:03,669
I'm on the verge of a heart attack.

390
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:14,269
I'll try doing yoga, it'll help.

391
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:17,029
Yoga must be good for you.

392
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:21,469
I shouldn't feel
this constant pit in my stomach.

393
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,229
It isn't normal.

394
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:30,109
I haven't even had an erection today.

395
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:32,469
That's even less normal.

396
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,629
You can feel so lonely.

397
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:52,949
Roland's here.

398
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:55,949
There he is.

399
00:39:01,149 --> 00:39:02,869
Hurry up, OK?

400
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,629
You were told to hurry up.

401
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:09,834
"Hu"...?

402
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:11,154
"Hurry up."

403
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:12,589
"Hu up?"

404
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:13,668
"Hurry up."

405
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,068
Hu... hu...

406
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:20,789
Come on, come with us.

407
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:26,349
Come with us, OK?

408
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:29,549
You're coming with us?

409
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:32,869
You're coming with us.

410
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:39,549
He's here, he's here, the gentleman.

411
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,029
He's here. Roland is here.

412
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:50,749
Roland is here.

413
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:56,229
Hurry up.

414
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:58,909
Roland is here.

415
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,589
Roland is here.

416
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:04,429
Hurry up.

417
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:10,789
Look! We're on drugs!

418
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,789
Can you smell it?

419
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,109
No way!

420
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:18,749
We're not good here.

421
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,829
Then come with me.

422
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:25,509
We can't even see each other.

423
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,749
Drugs! Drugs!

424
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:30,829
I'll be right back.

425
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:35,469
We don't care about pink elephants.

426
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:38,149
I like elephants the way they are.

427
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:43,109
Yes, the gentleman is here.

428
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:49,509
Stop... stop.

429
00:40:50,669 --> 00:40:53,189
How are you, sir?

430
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:56,509
You're... You're kind.

431
00:40:59,229 --> 00:41:01,029
- You're kind.
- Thank you.

432
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:05,949
Yes.

433
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:35,069
OK...

434
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,749
The gentleman is over there.

435
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:58,509
But there's nothing we can do.

436
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,349
Nothing we can do.

437
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:10,829
Nothing we can do.

438
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:53,869
<i>Yaya, yaya, talk!</i>

439
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,829
<i>Transmit!</i>

440
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,269
<i>Affirmative.</i>

441
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:06,229
<i>Go straight up to the ER, Yaya.</i>

442
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:10,829
<i>Remember the guy with the red jacket?</i>

443
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,109
<i>The police have brought him back again.</i>

444
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:15,949
<i>No idea what's going on.</i>

445
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:19,869
<i>Just check everything's OK in the ER.</i>

446
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:23,189
We need to examine you
because there's some bleeding, Madam.

447
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:27,549
I'm going to make sure
there are no anomalies.

448
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:31,269
Don't worry,
the baby's heartrate is normal.

449
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:32,949
There aren't any...

450
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:39,029
Was the placenta intact?

451
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:45,709
Can you move a bit?
Let your legs go down.

452
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:47,509
There you go.

453
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:49,549
Would you go out a few minutes?

454
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:50,789
We're going to examine you.

455
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:54,349
Just while we check the bleeding, OK?

456
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:59,069
Don't go too far.
Sit in the waiting room.

457
00:46:59,229 --> 00:47:02,029
- I don't feel the sac.
- You don't feel it?

458
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:05,229
I don't feel the sac.

459
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:11,869
Oh, yes I do.

460
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,549
I'm going to press down
on your baby's bottom.

461
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:19,789
Now there's a contraction.

462
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:23,309
Do you feel something?

463
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:26,829
Do your contractions hurt?

464
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:30,389
What I'm doing is uncomfortable.

465
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:34,149
There are anomalies.
We're going to the O.R.

466
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,669
We're going to the O.R.,
the baby's heart has an anomaly.

467
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:42,069
Nothing major, but there's
some serious bleeding down below.

468
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:44,269
I don't want to take any risks.

469
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:53,469
- Let's test.
- OK. Testing.

470
00:47:54,549 --> 00:47:56,192
Do you feel that, ma'am?

471
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:57,269
Yes.

472
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:58,629
Does it pinch?

473
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,069
They're big pinches.

474
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:11,389
Let's go.

475
00:48:11,549 --> 00:48:12,589
19...

476
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,429
Everything OK?

477
00:48:58,749 --> 00:49:01,909
Can we have more light?

478
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,109
Does that hurt?

479
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:28,349
There's a placental abruption.

480
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:30,549
- There's a RPH?
- There's a RPH.

481
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:39,309
There's a RPH, huh?
OK, let's go.

482
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:43,469
Your baby's coming, OK?

483
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:46,829
Push.

484
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:51,029
OK, great.

485
00:49:57,669 --> 00:49:59,709
OK, your little sweety's coming.

486
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:02,949
Super. OK, Clamps!

487
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:04,869
Yes, super!

488
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:06,549
You sure wanted to scare us.

489
00:50:07,229 --> 00:50:08,309
Hi!

490
00:50:08,469 --> 00:50:10,069
That's right, my kitten.

491
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:12,149
What are you doing to us?

492
00:50:13,389 --> 00:50:14,429
Huh, kitten?

493
00:50:14,589 --> 00:50:15,989
I know.

494
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:17,949
I know.

495
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:22,709
Congratulations, Madam!

496
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:28,709
She's smaller than expected.

497
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:37,629
The placenta had separated.

498
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:40,069
That's why there were anomalies.

499
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:42,149
That's why there was bleeding.

500
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:44,829
- She's tiny, tiny!
- A little shrimp.

501
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:47,429
- You tiny shrimp!
- A pretty little shrimp.

502
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:48,909
Congratulations.

503
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:52,429
She was born at 21 minutes past.

504
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:55,909
6:21 p.m.

505
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,389
Let's see the pediatrician.

506
00:50:57,549 --> 00:51:01,029
Give her a kiss before I take her.
Let's clean this up.

507
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:02,221
Don't worry...

508
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:03,541
The Synto is wearing off...

509
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:06,269
Good idea!
It had already separated anyways.

510
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:08,429
You don't say!

511
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:10,069
You and your jokes...

512
00:51:10,629 --> 00:51:12,069
Come here, little one.

513
00:51:12,629 --> 00:51:14,189
Let's go see the pediatrician.

514
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,149
You're so tiny.

515
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:37,189
You have the right to be mad.

516
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:39,669
You have the right.

517
00:51:40,629 --> 00:51:42,389
What's going on here?

518
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:47,789
My little kitten.

519
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:22,709
It's all perfect.

520
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:29,909
That's right.

521
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:32,549
I know, I know...

522
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:43,229
Yes, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

523
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:46,509
Everything is all right.

524
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:48,309
OK?

525
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:50,789
That's right.

526
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:57,829
Don't cry, everything is just fine.

527
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:51,189
Is it all right if I examine you?

528
00:53:51,509 --> 00:53:52,629
Yes.

529
00:53:58,149 --> 00:53:59,909
I know, I'm bothering you.

530
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:01,949
I'm bothering you.

531
00:54:10,269 --> 00:54:12,509
Five little fingers.
Five little fingers.

532
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:16,109
You're strong.
Wow, what strength!

533
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:18,149
What strength.

534
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:32,192
There are three vessels in the cord.
I don't know if they noted it.

535
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:33,309
Sorry?

536
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:35,429
There are three vessels.

537
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,469
It's OK if they didn't write it down.

538
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:41,949
It says "2 edematous vessels"
but 3 vessels.

539
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:44,309
"Presence of three vessels."

540
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:47,069
Which is normal.

541
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:11,869
This is the placenta.
The baby is on this side.

542
00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:13,949
Sorry, what am I saying?

543
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:17,029
The baby is on this side,
with the cord,

544
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:20,269
and this side
is attached to the mother's uterus.

545
00:55:20,669 --> 00:55:21,669
OK.

546
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:28,869
This is the sac

547
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:31,229
that holds the amnion.

548
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:34,549
This is what ruptures
when your water breaks,

549
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:37,149
triggering labor.

550
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:51,909
Sometimes, you'll find vascular lesions

551
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:55,269
all over the parenchyma
when you cut it open.

552
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:57,509
This can indicate

553
00:55:57,669 --> 00:56:00,069
miscarriages or delayed growth.

554
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:40,189
The lesion is in
the lower outer quadrant.

555
00:57:42,069 --> 00:57:45,669
The tumor is located
in the lower outer quadrant.

556
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:50,829
"The tumor is located
in the lower outer quadrant: LOQ."

557
00:57:50,989 --> 00:57:51,989
Right.

558
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:54,709
It measures...

559
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:58,629
It's bigger than I said earlier.

560
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:00,349
4...

561
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:03,829
by 2.5...

562
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:07,309
by 3.

563
00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:10,069
Inner margin.

564
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,189
1.2.

565
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:24,669
And description of distance
to the lumpectomy margins.

566
00:58:25,488 --> 00:58:26,535
And ink.

567
00:58:26,575 --> 00:58:29,189
What does "inner margin" mean?

568
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:34,069
Upper inner quadrant.

569
00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:37,789
Distance to margins...

570
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,149
Inner margin...

571
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,909
Write "1.2" here too, please.

572
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:49,229
- Black ink?
- Yes.

573
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:52,309
Inner quadrant.

574
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:56,309
Upper inner quadrant.

575
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:58,269
Wait, is that right?

576
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,109
That's wrong.

577
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:17,669
It's weird.

578
00:59:24,749 --> 00:59:26,509
Do you weigh breasts here,
Jean-Pierre?

579
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:29,389
- Sorry?
- Do you weigh breasts in Macro?

580
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:32,229
Is it on the specs sheet?

581
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:35,709
"Tumor, nipple...
size, depth of margins..."

582
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:36,989
No.

583
00:59:37,509 --> 00:59:39,789
There's nothing about weight.

584
00:59:40,669 --> 00:59:44,509
Write in full:
"Location: union of inner quadrants."

585
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:51,389
It's lopsided.

586
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:54,989
The upper quadrant.

587
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,949
Upper margin: 2 cm.

588
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,269
"Upper margin: 2 cm."

589
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:06,709
Ink...

590
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,309
There's no ink.

591
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:21,349
This is atrocious.
Whoever did this did a horrible job.

592
01:00:21,509 --> 01:00:25,229
Ask for a new slice
of the first one, please.

593
01:00:26,229 --> 01:00:28,629
The slice is completely...

594
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:30,949
It's full of holes.

595
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:32,829
This can't be analyzed.

596
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:35,629
If I say there's no metastasis,
but it's in the hole...

597
01:00:42,749 --> 01:00:45,389
Here, we have some hyaline tissue.

598
01:00:45,549 --> 01:00:48,469
There are practically no more
tumor cells.

599
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:54,149
There are leftover tumor cells here.

600
01:00:55,509 --> 01:00:57,149
These are tumor cells.

601
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:00,269
But I'll just say there's a tumor.

602
01:01:00,429 --> 01:01:02,589
I won't go further into it than that.

603
01:01:02,749 --> 01:01:05,389
It was too modified by chemotherapy.

604
01:01:06,949 --> 01:01:10,029
The cells are too atypical to be...

605
01:01:10,189 --> 01:01:13,869
The non-tumoral cells in this area

606
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:16,109
are these spindly cells, here.

607
01:01:16,269 --> 01:01:20,469
This fibrous tissue neoplasm
holds it all together.

608
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:23,429
To support the...

609
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,429
the breast.

610
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:30,269
There are a few tumorous cells left,
but some areas have a lot more.

611
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:32,229
So, indeed...

612
01:01:32,709 --> 01:01:34,069
That being said,

613
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:38,509
I sometimes write:
"Indicative degree after treatment."

614
01:01:38,669 --> 01:01:39,909
It's dumb.

615
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:43,189
Very dumb.

616
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:45,069
I'll do it. We'll see if...

617
01:01:45,229 --> 01:01:48,069
Anyways,
it's too hard to differentiate,

618
01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:50,309
the atypia is pronounced,

619
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:52,709
there isn't much mitosis, so...

620
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:56,269
Do as you like.

621
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:58,424
Is it lobular, 3+2+1?

622
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,475
Yes.

623
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:02,075
The cells here are...

624
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:04,429
These are giant cells.

625
01:02:05,149 --> 01:02:07,309
And these aren't tumorous.

626
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:11,189
They're cells
that reacted to foreign body cells.

627
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:13,989
The cells died during chemotherapy

628
01:02:14,149 --> 01:02:15,829
and these cells clean up

629
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:18,549
the tumor necrosis.

630
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:21,989
After cleaning everything up,
it'll look like this.

631
01:02:22,149 --> 01:02:24,669
You'll see a fibrous orange scar.

632
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:26,509
Like this.

633
01:02:26,669 --> 01:02:29,109
Here, we have all the aspects.

634
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:31,029
It doesn't always work perfectly.

635
01:02:31,189 --> 01:02:34,229
So you probably have
some residual tumor cells.

636
01:02:34,749 --> 01:02:36,709
Unfortunately, it doesn't always work.

637
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:38,829
But this is a granuloma.

638
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:42,829
It's the intermediary step
before scarring.

639
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:47,629
These are tumor cells.

640
01:02:49,669 --> 01:02:52,589
- Is that normal?
- No. They aren't normal.

641
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:55,629
They've been modified by chemotherapy.

642
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:00,389
They often get very big,

643
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:02,989
like those that survive chemotherapy.

644
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:08,669
Here, you have tumor cells.
They get into the nerve sheath.

645
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:11,149
It's called nerve sheathing.

646
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:13,629
It means the prognosis is bad.

647
01:03:14,029 --> 01:03:16,309
It means the tumor
has managed to slide...

648
01:03:16,469 --> 01:03:17,549
Although...

649
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:22,469
I'm not sure there is one,
because the vessels are so small.

650
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:26,509
- It might be a lymphatic embolus.
- Perhaps.

651
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:29,309
This woman had tissue removal.
Did she have metastases?

652
01:03:29,949 --> 01:03:31,509
I don't think so.

653
01:03:31,669 --> 01:03:34,749
They didn't give us any information.
It's a pain.

654
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:37,709
- As usual.
- That's gynecologists for you.

655
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:45,989
I'm not sure we have emboli.
Do you see any?

656
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:50,389
I don't know.
I'd say we have 30% residual tumors.

657
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:52,749
Maybe even 20%.

658
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:55,269
In the breast.

659
01:03:55,389 --> 01:03:56,909
She was born in 60... 42.

660
01:03:57,069 --> 01:04:00,989
That's why she has so many lobules,
she's still young.

661
01:04:10,229 --> 01:04:11,469
Here is the nipple.

662
01:04:11,909 --> 01:04:13,669
Cutaneous tissue.

663
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:16,029
The mucous membrane.

664
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:19,149
Cutaneous tissue of the nipple,
that's the surface.

665
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:22,109
And here, we have

666
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:25,309
the large lactiferous duct,
which brings...

667
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:28,429
or would have brought milk
to the surface.

668
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:30,229
It's a large caliber.

669
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:32,909
- It's a bad slice.
- A very bad slice.

670
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,149
You stuffed the cassette.

671
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:38,149
You should've done 2 slices.

672
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:42,069
You could've done more.

673
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:49,349
I do a lot for...

674
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:51,149
after chemo.

675
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:55,749
We have a good idea of
what you did, but...

676
01:05:01,389 --> 01:05:03,149
I would take some more.

677
01:05:03,309 --> 01:05:05,029
Can you do another slice?

678
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:48,629
It's a weird view, isn't it?

679
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:50,669
It's a weird view.

680
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:51,909
Yeah.

681
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,149
The only problem is that
in the video I watched

682
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:57,789
there was no medial lobe.

683
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:00,149
This one had one on the MRI.

684
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:04,189
Of course,
what you find online isn't always...

685
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:13,469
If we manage to do it in 1.5 hours,
that's not bad for the first time, right?

686
01:08:13,629 --> 01:08:14,789
Yeah.

687
01:08:14,949 --> 01:08:17,429
Careful with the forceps, Idir.
Want me to take them?

688
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:18,909
What forceps?

689
01:08:22,429 --> 01:08:26,549
We can't let it bleed.
We need to be close to the Retzius.

690
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:30,829
Go ahead, bridge them.

691
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:35,069
Let me go under.

692
01:08:36,509 --> 01:08:37,789
Go over me.

693
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:39,429
Over me.

694
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:44,109
Are you above me?

695
01:08:45,309 --> 01:08:48,509
Pass above me and hold the bladder.
There you go.

696
01:08:48,669 --> 01:08:50,269
- I'm above you.
- Like this.

697
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:51,629
I'm above.

698
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:53,709
Super.

699
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,229
I'm coming in closer...

700
01:08:58,629 --> 01:08:59,629
I'm lost.

701
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:01,909
- What?
- I'm a bit lost.

702
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:06,789
Can you brief me?
We zoomed in too much, I'm lost.

703
01:09:07,469 --> 01:09:09,429
It's getting a bit abstract.

704
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:14,029
It's a big prostate.

705
01:09:15,549 --> 01:09:17,629
Can you clean an eye?

706
01:09:18,349 --> 01:09:19,669
Can you see?

707
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:21,429
Yeah, I'm a bit lost.

708
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:23,429
Can you clean an eye?

709
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:44,109
This prostate is massive.

710
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:46,309
Here.

711
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,669
Pass me the...

712
01:09:48,629 --> 01:09:49,909
the bag, please.

713
01:09:55,549 --> 01:09:58,029
Clean up your table, it's a mess.

714
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,269
Do you see the medial lobe?

715
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:06,709
We'll look at the col
and you'll handle the rest.

716
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:23,709
Go ahead.

717
01:10:24,589 --> 01:10:27,549
Can you pull the third arm up
a bit more?

718
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:30,669
It's super big!
It might not fit inside.

719
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:32,909
It'll fit inside.

720
01:10:33,589 --> 01:10:35,309
Hold on, I'll go behind.

721
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:38,269
This guy's weirdly put together.

722
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:46,829
What's in my way?

723
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:48,789
I think it's your arm.

724
01:10:55,949 --> 01:10:57,789
Can you pull on this crap?

725
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:02,349
- And don't pull from 15 miles away.
- No, no. I'll manage.

726
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:08,429
What are you doing?
Why are you irrigating?

727
01:11:08,589 --> 01:11:10,869
- Olivier, are you irrigating?
- I think so.

728
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:12,589
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

729
01:11:12,749 --> 01:11:14,109
What do you mean?

730
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:17,429
Why are you looking at the screen?

731
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:20,749
- Look at the hole.
- The hole and between your hands.

732
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,029
Hold on.

733
01:11:22,749 --> 01:11:24,949
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

734
01:11:28,549 --> 01:11:30,549
His dick is super swollen.

735
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:32,869
You really get on my nerves.

736
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:34,909
He has a horrible penile edema...

737
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:37,789
It's normal. It's called air.

738
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:40,269
What I'm doing is very complicated.

739
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,949
Plus, I'm not an expert in this field.

740
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:47,549
Now you're going to suck up
the fluids from the bottom.

741
01:11:47,709 --> 01:11:48,949
Where is the suction tube?

742
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:51,869
- It fell on the floor.
- Fuck!

743
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:53,189
Damn it!

744
01:11:58,869 --> 01:12:00,109
Is it clean?

745
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,349
Yes.

746
01:12:01,629 --> 01:12:04,509
Take the suction tube
and get that corner, please.

747
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:06,349
I'm putting it together.

748
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:10,829
They gave me a shitty one.

749
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:11,989
Shut up.

750
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:14,789
Give him a fucking suction tube!

751
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:20,469
What are you doing?
We need another suction tube.

752
01:12:20,629 --> 01:12:24,149
- I know, we're all out.
- Are you serious?

753
01:12:27,189 --> 01:12:28,309
What's going on?

754
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,509
Give him the suction tube!
He's playing LEGO.

755
01:12:31,669 --> 01:12:34,229
I'm not playing LEGO.

756
01:12:34,389 --> 01:12:35,389
Right here.

757
01:12:36,549 --> 01:12:38,509
And screw it, like this. Yes.

758
01:12:38,669 --> 01:12:40,469
Take the big one.

759
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:46,149
And plug one end into each hole.

760
01:12:46,309 --> 01:12:48,469
One for sucking, one for rinsing.

761
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:50,469
It's the same tunnel system.

762
01:12:52,629 --> 01:12:53,789
He dropped the tube.

763
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:55,629
Give us the other one.

764
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:57,149
I'm out of 45's.

765
01:12:57,309 --> 01:12:59,229
- What do you have?
- Just this.

766
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:03,669
I know it's not the same,
but it's all we have.

767
01:13:06,309 --> 01:13:07,429
Careful...

768
01:13:07,589 --> 01:13:08,909
We have a problem.

769
01:13:09,749 --> 01:13:12,469
We'll see if it's Niagara Falls or not.

770
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:16,109
It's leaking right here.
Stop! I see it clearly.

771
01:13:16,269 --> 01:13:18,109
It's leaking really bad.

772
01:13:19,549 --> 01:13:23,189
Let's do an X stitch
with the big V-lock needle.

773
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:27,589
Will this work?

774
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:31,709
- What just happened?
- It's nothing, don't worry.

775
01:13:33,429 --> 01:13:34,709
What a nightmare!

776
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:40,309
We're going to try something.
I don't know what, but...

777
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:44,149
It won't work.
We'll need more sutures.

778
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:45,989
But for now...

779
01:13:46,469 --> 01:13:49,349
I'll back up
so you don't stick in just anywhere.

780
01:13:51,669 --> 01:13:52,829
OK, go.

781
01:13:57,509 --> 01:13:59,469
These forceps are screwed up.

782
01:13:59,629 --> 01:14:01,629
Why are you sucking now?

783
01:14:01,789 --> 01:14:03,349
I'm not, it's just the...

784
01:14:03,509 --> 01:14:04,789
OK, let go.

785
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:08,469
Make sure the thread
is completely through.

786
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:11,309
Nothing is coming out.

787
01:14:12,109 --> 01:14:13,752
OK, stitch the edges.

788
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:14,869
Hold on...

789
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,709
- You need to hurry, Olivier.
- I know, I know.

790
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:20,069
- I'm stitching.
- Do it, fuck it!

791
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:22,109
Yes, it's in. I'm coming.

792
01:14:22,269 --> 01:14:23,789
Come on, Olivier.

793
01:14:24,469 --> 01:14:26,829
This is bad. Very bad.

794
01:14:30,669 --> 01:14:33,029
I never should have started this.

795
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:36,269
I really shouldn't have started.

796
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:39,869
We need to change the probe
to check the drained bladder.

797
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:42,389
This patient will need a catheter.

798
01:14:42,549 --> 01:14:44,829
I watched the Master Class

799
01:14:45,229 --> 01:14:47,109
by that Indian guy.

800
01:14:47,269 --> 01:14:51,389
He said patients with medial lobes
aren't good cases.

801
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:52,909
- Hi, Rachid.
- How are you?

802
01:14:53,069 --> 01:14:54,789
- Really bad, man.
- Why?

803
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,549
This prostate almost killed me.

804
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:59,869
It's a bad one. I wanted to do
a Retzius-sparing from behind,

805
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:01,789
but it's my first time.

806
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:05,909
And an anastomosis on a big prostate
is really tough.

807
01:15:06,429 --> 01:15:10,029
- Did you open the front?
- No, I didn't.

808
01:15:10,189 --> 01:15:13,069
Stop the insufflation
and set it to the side.

809
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:15,549
Watch his face.
Cover his face.

810
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:21,789
Normally, it should be... For security.

811
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:26,429
Right, security!
Look, it's too big.

812
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:32,549
Give us some light.
Can I use this?

813
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:34,069
Yes, it's ours.

814
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:37,029
Hand me the electric scalpel.

815
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:38,749
I hope it didn't fall.

816
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:40,949
- It's on the floor.
- Yes.

817
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:43,149
- It's on the floor?
- I didn't check.

818
01:15:43,309 --> 01:15:44,829
- Olivier?
- I don't know.

819
01:15:44,989 --> 01:15:46,989
If it fell, it fell.

820
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:51,309
Strange he hasn't peed.
Last time, it didn't turn out well.

821
01:16:10,309 --> 01:16:12,829
PARIS HOSPITALS 2008

822
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:37,269
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE

823
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:48,789
So you locked him in?

824
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:34,709
He's coming out.

825
01:17:48,349 --> 01:17:50,069
Yes. Yes.

826
01:18:13,069 --> 01:18:15,749
The door's open. Super. Super.

827
01:18:16,669 --> 01:18:18,309
Really super.

828
01:18:26,549 --> 01:18:28,389
We can leave it like this.

829
01:18:28,749 --> 01:18:29,789
Yes.

830
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:38,869
- Oh yes.
- There.

831
01:18:41,749 --> 01:18:43,469
This is the façade.

832
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:47,989
I'm off.
I say, "see you later."

833
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:50,229
All right.

834
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:14,069
What time does she leave?

835
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:18,429
I think she's the last to go.

836
01:21:01,269 --> 01:21:03,149
Are you comfortable?

837
01:21:05,309 --> 01:21:07,109
Are you comfortable?

838
01:21:09,389 --> 01:21:10,789
Everything is all right?

839
01:22:59,309 --> 01:23:03,069
It's funny,
there's a vein in the pedicle.

840
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:05,749
When we draw back, it bleeds.

841
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:09,669
We had another case like that.
The 4th or 5th patient.

842
01:23:09,829 --> 01:23:11,829
There was a lot of bleeding.

843
01:23:11,989 --> 01:23:14,149
And the curves were...

844
01:23:14,309 --> 01:23:16,349
There's been a huge increase.

845
01:23:16,509 --> 01:23:19,029
That's why we have 22 perfect cases.

846
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:21,789
We can't explain why
it's increasing so much.

847
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:23,429
There's no gap.

848
01:23:24,469 --> 01:23:27,229
Yes, we're seeing
pedicles with vessels.

849
01:23:28,869 --> 01:23:31,629
Vessels or an angioma.

850
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:35,469
Or remainders of the growth plate,
which should be...

851
01:23:35,629 --> 01:23:37,429
- But he's big, right?
- Yes.

852
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:39,269
But even with pigs.

853
01:23:39,429 --> 01:23:43,229
We operated on a little pig
which had some cartilage.

854
01:23:43,389 --> 01:23:45,189
It's really increasing.

855
01:23:45,789 --> 01:23:47,869
In contact with growth plates.

856
01:23:48,029 --> 01:23:49,189
Poor animal.

857
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,749
It's all in the name of science!

858
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:56,029
Always.

859
01:24:11,309 --> 01:24:13,149
More, more, more.

860
01:24:13,429 --> 01:24:14,429
Stop.

861
01:24:20,429 --> 01:24:21,829
I'll let you cut.

862
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:24,509
I assembled some furniture
instead of children.

863
01:24:24,669 --> 01:24:26,549
I ruptured my biceps.

864
01:24:26,709 --> 01:24:29,149
- Perfect.
- A real rupture?

865
01:24:29,909 --> 01:24:33,789
I only have 10% tissue left
on my biceps.

866
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:35,749
Near the elbow?

867
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:39,669
I lifted a 50-kg box and felt a...

868
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:43,989
Careful,
some bits of bone are falling off.

869
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:45,989
Are you going to have surgery?

870
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:47,389
You kidding?

871
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:53,069
May God preserve me from hand surgeons!

872
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:57,709
I'd be 10 years younger
if you'd operated on me.

873
01:24:57,869 --> 01:25:01,789
You should ask the manufacturer
to fix this.

874
01:25:01,949 --> 01:25:03,429
We can't adjust it anymore.

875
01:25:03,589 --> 01:25:06,949
I tried fixing it last week, it's stuck.
It's a pain.

876
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,629
And so... Go ahead, have at it.

877
01:25:11,429 --> 01:25:14,429
We have an advanced stage
of kyphosis.

878
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:43,629
Hand me that.

879
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:09,709
I'll straighten it out.

880
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:13,669
And now...

881
01:26:20,629 --> 01:26:22,909
Hand me a screwdriver.

882
01:27:03,429 --> 01:27:04,989
We're going to change our...

883
01:27:05,629 --> 01:27:07,109
Let's change our gloves.

884
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:22,789
A bit more water, please.

885
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:51,189
Wake up, big guy! Open your eyes.

886
01:29:24,029 --> 01:29:25,469
It's over now.

887
01:29:40,229 --> 01:29:42,789
You're all tangled up, big guy.

888
01:30:18,509 --> 01:30:22,029
Hang on, just a few more seconds.

889
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:42,789
<i>Chief, do you receive me?</i>

890
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:44,429
<i>I'm listening.</i>

891
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:46,309
<i>Send someone up to the 15th.</i>

892
01:30:46,469 --> 01:30:50,269
<i>A man in the hallway
is saying his prayers.</i>

893
01:30:50,669 --> 01:30:52,069
<i>5th floor east wing?</i>

894
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:54,789
<i>15th. 15th floor, east wing.</i>

895
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:56,309
<i>OK, message received.</i>

896
01:30:56,469 --> 01:30:59,949
<i>An old man in a black suit.</i>

897
01:33:59,189 --> 01:34:00,869
We put it on backwards.

898
01:34:01,429 --> 01:34:02,709
Are you serious?

899
01:34:03,189 --> 01:34:04,589
Let's start again.

900
01:34:05,029 --> 01:34:07,869
How to jump into your briefs
without touching the elastic!

901
01:35:01,749 --> 01:35:03,549
I don't know if they're his size.

902
01:35:03,709 --> 01:35:04,949
Yes, they are.

903
01:35:20,949 --> 01:35:22,229
Are you serious?

904
01:35:58,829 --> 01:36:00,269
Look at those hands!

905
01:36:00,429 --> 01:36:02,309
Right? If he hit you,

906
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:04,229
you'd definitely feel it.

907
01:36:47,549 --> 01:36:49,669
Give me his hand.

908
01:36:49,829 --> 01:36:51,829
His sweater is too snug.

909
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:29,749
It should be on top.

910
01:38:47,989 --> 01:38:49,469
Let him do it.

911
01:38:52,789 --> 01:38:54,789
Excuse me, ladies, gentlemen.

912
01:38:57,669 --> 01:39:00,589
Let him try.
He wants to try, let him.

913
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:02,309
You want help?

914
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:03,949
Yes. Ground floor.

915
01:39:04,109 --> 01:39:07,429
- Are you managing, sir?
- Ground floor.

916
01:39:08,389 --> 01:39:10,149
We're going down. Down.

917
01:39:10,309 --> 01:39:12,029
Will you come back? We tried.

918
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:15,189
We're going down.
Going down here. Here.

919
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:16,469
No, no, no.

920
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:17,749
Yes.

921
01:39:17,909 --> 01:39:20,589
- Let's keep moving.
- Wait, we're going down.

922
01:39:20,749 --> 01:39:22,909
Come with me, it's stuck.

923
01:39:24,349 --> 01:39:25,789
- Going down here.
- Let's go.

924
01:39:25,949 --> 01:39:28,989
We're going down here.
To see if it goes down.

925
01:39:29,149 --> 01:39:32,349
- We'll need to put you in the room.
- If it goes down.

926
01:39:32,509 --> 01:39:34,949
- We need to put you in your room.
- Not the room.

927
01:39:35,109 --> 01:39:36,789
Then come with me.

928
01:39:36,949 --> 01:39:38,389
- Not yet.
- Yes.

929
01:39:38,549 --> 01:39:39,829
Not yet.

930
01:39:39,989 --> 01:39:42,069
I'm going to get my colleague.

931
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:45,789
- Listen...
- Yes, I'm a man.

932
01:39:45,949 --> 01:39:47,349
I'm warning you.

933
01:39:47,509 --> 01:39:49,829
Come with me,
or you're going to your room.

934
01:39:49,989 --> 01:39:53,069
- In my room.
- We'll come back.

935
01:39:53,229 --> 01:39:54,989
In my room.

936
01:39:55,149 --> 01:39:56,789
We'll come back.

937
01:40:00,309 --> 01:40:01,909
Come on, let's go.

938
01:40:02,069 --> 01:40:04,349
- To my room.
- I have work to do.

939
01:40:06,029 --> 01:40:09,349
- Let's go, please.
- Yes, we're going.

940
01:40:10,269 --> 01:40:11,589
You usually come.

941
01:40:14,149 --> 01:40:17,189
- Let's try the other side.
- Let's try this side.

942
01:40:17,989 --> 01:40:19,229
This side.

943
01:40:22,109 --> 01:40:24,109
I'm going to get my colleague.

944
01:40:24,829 --> 01:40:26,429
Let's keep trying here.

945
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:29,509
Who is your contact? Your contact?

946
01:40:32,189 --> 01:40:34,749
- He's over here.
- Yes? Who is it?

947
01:40:34,909 --> 01:40:37,789
- Hervé. You know him?
- Who is Hervé?

948
01:40:38,349 --> 01:40:39,629
Who is Hervé?

949
01:40:44,829 --> 01:40:47,589
You were good this morning.
We didn't have any problems.

950
01:40:47,749 --> 01:40:50,069
- Let's go.
- Yes. Yes.

951
01:40:57,549 --> 01:40:58,629
He's here.

952
01:41:00,269 --> 01:41:01,469
Sir?

953
01:41:01,869 --> 01:41:03,509
Hervé is coming.

954
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:05,749
We're putting you in your room. OK?

955
01:41:05,909 --> 01:41:07,509
In my room? My room?

956
01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:09,429
Because you won't listen.

957
01:41:09,589 --> 01:41:12,029
- It isn't worth it.
- Come, sir.

958
01:41:12,869 --> 01:41:16,149
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- Hello, Mr. President.

959
01:41:16,309 --> 01:41:18,869
- Come this way.
- I'm trying to touch it.

960
01:41:19,029 --> 01:41:22,509
- We're leaving with Régis.
- I don't want to do room.

961
01:41:23,749 --> 01:41:25,949
I don't want to do room.

962
01:41:26,829 --> 01:41:30,189
Yes, but you always try to leave.
That's the problem.

963
01:41:30,349 --> 01:41:32,549
- I try to leave.
- What can we do?

964
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:34,709
Our hands are tied.

965
01:41:36,869 --> 01:41:39,469
<i>Why the hell am I here?</i>

966
01:41:39,629 --> 01:41:41,469
<i>You're waiting for the doctor.</i>

967
01:41:41,629 --> 01:41:45,749
<i>He's just going to come
and tell me that I'm fine.</i>

968
01:41:48,229 --> 01:41:50,789
He's not a real doctor.

969
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:52,869
I want to die.

970
01:41:53,549 --> 01:41:55,309
I don't want to live.

971
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:57,749
<i>I want to leave.</i>

972
01:41:58,749 --> 01:42:00,829
<i>I want to die!</i>

973
01:42:02,589 --> 01:42:04,549
We'll put him in his room, Régis?

974
01:42:05,389 --> 01:42:07,189
- In his room?
- Yes.

975
01:42:07,349 --> 01:42:09,269
I don't want to do...

976
01:42:16,509 --> 01:42:18,429
I want to work, like you.

977
01:42:18,829 --> 01:42:20,709
I want to work, like you.

978
01:42:21,389 --> 01:42:22,789
I want to work, like you.

979
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:24,189
This way.

980
01:42:25,989 --> 01:42:27,709
We need to finish the dishes.

981
01:42:27,869 --> 01:42:30,552
So you'll go to your room
for 30 min. OK?

982
01:42:30,592 --> 01:42:31,614
Yes.

983
01:42:31,654 --> 01:42:32,934
Is that all right?

984
01:42:33,269 --> 01:42:35,989
- Half an hour?
- Half an hour, as promised.

985
01:42:37,269 --> 01:42:38,429
As usual.

986
01:42:39,589 --> 01:42:42,949
- That's all. Then you can come out.
- That was fun, right?

987
01:42:43,829 --> 01:42:46,469
- It was a nice walk.
- Half an hour?

988
01:42:47,309 --> 01:42:48,749
Yes, and then we'll come back.

989
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:50,669
- Half an hour?
- Just 30 min.

990
01:42:50,829 --> 01:42:53,349
- 30 minutes, for sure?
- We promise.

991
01:42:53,509 --> 01:42:55,229
You'll open in 30 min?

992
01:42:55,389 --> 01:42:57,549
- What time will it be?
- 30 min?

993
01:42:57,709 --> 01:43:01,149
- What time will it be?
- 11... 11:25.

994
01:43:01,309 --> 01:43:03,669
No, that's 1 o'clock. It's 1:30.

995
01:43:03,949 --> 01:43:05,429
So we'll open at 2 o'clock.

996
01:43:05,589 --> 01:43:07,309
2 o'clock.

997
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:11,629
No, 2:25. It's 25 now.

998
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:14,869
- How long is that?
- That's one hour.

999
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:16,349
That's too expensive.

1000
01:43:16,509 --> 01:43:18,509
- You mean, too long.
- Too a lot.

1001
01:43:18,669 --> 01:43:20,629
OK, 2 o'clock, then.

1002
01:43:20,789 --> 01:43:22,629
That's in 35 minutes.

1003
01:43:22,789 --> 01:43:24,109
OK, let's do that.

1004
01:43:24,269 --> 01:43:25,869
OK? Thank you, sir.

1005
01:43:26,029 --> 01:43:27,229
We'll do that.

1006
01:43:27,389 --> 01:43:29,389
See you soon, in 35 minutes.

1007
01:43:29,549 --> 01:43:32,469
I'll clean up, because it's new cloth.

1008
01:43:32,629 --> 01:43:34,669
Yes, you do that.

1009
01:43:34,829 --> 01:43:36,549
OK, take care of that.

1010
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:38,469
- 14 min.
- See you soon.

1011
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:39,949
35 minutes!

1012
01:43:40,109 --> 01:43:41,749
See you soon.

1013
01:43:43,869 --> 01:43:44,949
Thanks, Hervé.

1014
01:43:47,549 --> 01:43:49,149
One day, it all became too much.

1015
01:43:49,309 --> 01:43:52,029
Too much suffering, death,
and distressed families.

1016
01:43:52,189 --> 01:43:55,749
You went back through the O.R. doors,
returning to anesthesia.

1017
01:43:55,909 --> 01:43:59,749
Even though you mix up
Sufenta and noradrenalin,

1018
01:44:00,709 --> 01:44:03,189
otherwise, you're doing great.

1019
01:44:03,709 --> 01:44:07,029
You try your hand
at philosophy and ethics in general.

1020
01:44:07,189 --> 01:44:08,789
The Ethical Café in Beaujon,

1021
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:13,869
whose posters makes France's
<i>Depressed Anonymous </i>green with envy.

1022
01:44:15,229 --> 01:44:17,509
But you get a kick out of it.

1023
01:44:17,669 --> 01:44:19,509
And one day, you get the call:

1024
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:21,029
Canada wants you.

1025
01:44:21,189 --> 01:44:23,389
OK, they got a little mixed up,

1026
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:26,029
thinking you're an expert
on liver transplants.

1027
01:44:26,549 --> 01:44:28,589
Some say
it's the score of the century,

1028
01:44:28,749 --> 01:44:31,109
like Armand and me in New England.

1029
01:44:31,709 --> 01:44:34,189
But you can't lie
and now you're in RHD

1030
01:44:34,349 --> 01:44:37,269
to finally understand
how the liver works.

1031
01:44:37,429 --> 01:44:38,469
Your mustache twirls.

1032
01:44:38,509 --> 01:44:42,349
You stand before 4 lobes, 8 segments,
arteries and veins all over.

1033
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:45,589
But you hung on
and became an expert on everything.

1034
01:44:45,749 --> 01:44:47,829
With your bags full of knowledge,

1035
01:44:47,989 --> 01:44:50,229
memories, and friends for life,

1036
01:44:50,389 --> 01:44:52,629
you're off on new adventures.

1037
01:44:52,789 --> 01:44:55,109
On behalf of 1,009 of us,

1038
01:44:55,269 --> 01:44:58,349
we wish you, dear Pierre, all the best.

1039
01:44:58,509 --> 01:45:01,549
I'll end with a quote by
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

1040
01:45:01,709 --> 01:45:06,309
Stan, I know you expected a quote
from Maître Gims or Patrick Sébastien.

1041
01:45:07,349 --> 01:45:09,749
"The challenge is not
to foresee the future,

1042
01:45:09,909 --> 01:45:11,429
but to make it possible."
