1
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:36,618
When's your plane, darling?
Wish you weren't going.

2
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:39,619
The board is expecting me tomorrow.

3
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,654
I know. I wish
you didn't have to go.

4
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:47,611
I gotta see the old bastard.
When I get back, we'll take a trip.

5
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:51,214
- Isn't he a beauty?
- You're a beauty.

6
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:56,130
No, I'm not going to ride.

7
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,620
You got it.

8
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:32,216
You're under arrest
for Enrique Cordoza's murder.

9
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,689
Ann!

10
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,736
Enrique...

11
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:44,011
What do you mean, Enrique?

12
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,450
Jay!

13
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:48,535
What are you talking about?

14
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,453
- Mr. Wagner.
- Mr. Cable.

15
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,817
The frame-up is complete.

16
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:17,620
Your grandson was arrested in
Santiago, extradited to Mexico City.

17
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:20,739
He'll be convicted within the month.

18
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,740
Sentence?
- Between 25 and 30 years.

19
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:28,976
You resent my interference
in this matter.

20
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:33,011
We have a procedure
for those on the wrong side.

21
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:37,938
There's them and us.
The winning side and the losing side.

22
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:41,412
The line has not yet been drawn.

23
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,931
He supports those against us.

24
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:48,618
He threatened CIA interests
and my stockholders?

25
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,216
- Who did you have murdered?
- No one of importance.

26
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:57,300
I don't want my grandson
to suffer the same fate.

27
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:01,373
- Is that clear, Mr. Cable?
- Yes.

28
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:05,609
Your grandson will try to escape.

29
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:08,415
It's a pity, at my age...

30
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:11,215
falling victim to a cliché.

31
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,816
I don't know what you mean.

32
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:19,820
Because of a distant link
between his chromosomes and mine...

33
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,531
my grandson stays alive.

34
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:25,857
I say it's a mistake.

35
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,381
Perhaps.

36
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,810
Twenty-five to 30 years.

37
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:37,732
There's no possible way the accused
could have left Santiago...

38
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:43,055
flown to Mexico City and returned
at the time we documented.

39
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:45,891
Nonetheless, it is...

40
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,093
the decision of this court...

41
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,971
that you...

42
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,936
Jay Louis Wagner...

43
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:59,097
are guilty as charged.

44
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,692
You shall serve a term...

45
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:05,450
of 28 years
in the federal penitentiary.

46
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:10,138
You'll be allowed the same
privileges as all prisoners.

47
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,811
Including conjugal visits
every two weeks.

48
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,177
This judgment is final.

49
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:07,129
Goddamn sons of bitches!

50
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:10,054
Wait, wait. Hey, wait.

51
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,735
What did they do to you?

52
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:14,301
Huh?

53
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:18,414
They put their filthy hands
all over me.

54
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,891
Who's supposed
to boost whose morale up?

55
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,289
Jay, what are they doing to you?

56
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:36,255
Well, it's not exactly the Ritz.
But....

57
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:43,700
Well, it is pretty bad.
It really is. Where's the money?

58
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:48,571
In the back of the radio.

59
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,055
- I'll talk to your grandfather.
- No, absolutely not.

60
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,737
- I don't know what to do.
- I won't kiss his ass.

61
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,017
This is all we need.

62
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:08,133
They'll sell anything.
Including freedom.

63
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:13,580
I really think you must do it legally.
Sanchez has filed an appeal.

64
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:16,611
I can't wait that long.

65
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:20,131
Last week there was a guy
in for pushing drugs.

66
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:23,737
He walked and they're not
looking for him...

67
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:26,415
because he paid his way off.

68
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,851
I still think we should...

69
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:31,774
Absolutely not! No!

70
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,292
Look at this place.
Look what they're doing to me.

71
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:00,581
Jay.

72
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,060
I want you.

73
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:19,289
The day we're reduced
to making love in here is....

74
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,412
That's the day I give up.

75
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:39,575
Don't worry, darling. I have a plan.
And this money will do it.

76
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:43,810
What's going Okay? Let me out!

77
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:45,818
Wait, man. Just wait.

78
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:54,819
- What's happening? Let me out!
- All right, I will.

79
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:56,621
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

80
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,579
Let me out of here!

81
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:06,256
When I am ready, Mr. Wagner.

82
00:17:06,461 --> 00:17:08,019
Let me out of here!

83
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:10,895
Let me out!

84
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,092
Let me out of here!

85
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,893
Let me out of here!

86
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:31,058
We can't let him stay
in that horrible place.

87
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,498
- Of course not.
- We can't. I can't.

88
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:35,861
Ann...

89
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:41,257
it isn't just a matter
of fire and earth...

90
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,578
and air and water
that makes up this world.

91
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:47,978
It's passion and strength
and cunning...

92
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:49,181
and money.

93
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:52,249
I've got money.

94
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,412
As much as you'll need.

95
00:17:56,581 --> 00:18:00,620
Jay thinks he won't get out
of that place legally.

96
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:02,812
He wants to escape.

97
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:06,340
Has he got a plan?

98
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:08,101
Not yet.

99
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,181
Well....

100
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:15,010
Whatever it costs,
you can count on me.

101
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:35,337
Hawk! Let's get the hell out of here!

102
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:38,335
- Come on!
- I can't breathe, Nick!

103
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:41,812
- Where's the bucket?
- Get the hell out!

104
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:46,220
Hey! Get back!
There's gasoline in there. The thing...

105
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,736
It's okay. It's okay.

106
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:56,811
You can't burn smoked fish.
But look. I wouldn't have believed it.

107
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,934
- You know about smoked fish?
- Smoked fish?

108
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:04,015
- You from the health department?
- Do I look like It's?

109
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:06,815
I'm looking for Nick Colton.

110
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:09,256
They made me burn my fish.

111
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:11,253
There's two tons in there.

112
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:15,016
Maybe they made you
because your fish is spoiled?

113
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,054
No, they're opposed
to fish on principle.

114
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:22,214
I've got to find Nick Colton.
Do you know him?

115
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,180
Who wants to know?

116
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:34,296
He was recommended by a man
in Fort Worth. Mr. Charles Mazdick.

117
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:39,659
That's Charming Charlie. Hey, Hawk!

118
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,256
She knows Charming Charlie.

119
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:48,213
He said, ask Nick Colton.
He'll do anything for money.

120
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:58,018
If old Charlie said so, you can
plug in, baby, because I'm Nick.

121
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,816
- You?
- Hawk, keep shoveling.

122
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:02,977
I'll be back to help.

123
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,941
So you want me to fly to Mexico...

124
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:17,019
pick up this dude,
and bring him back.

125
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,221
Exactly.

126
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:22,619
I should tell you
Pan Am does it five times a day...

127
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,539
with meals! Sit down.

128
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:27,614
Not on that road, they don't.

129
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:33,097
- Got a name? Passport? This guy?
- None that needs to concern you.

130
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:38,054
A poor slob needs a lift.
Be Kind to Hitchhikers week?

131
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:39,814
Can you do It's?

132
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:44,734
I can land a jumbo jet on a quarter.

133
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:47,411
I'm willing to offer $1000.

134
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:55,372
I'll tell you, 1000 has never
been a figure to palpitate me.

135
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,737
Don't judge us on looks.
We're growing.

136
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:04,816
Or the fish out there. I have checks
I haven't cashed. Look here.

137
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:09,452
Here's one for $500. I haven't had
time to take it to the bank.

138
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,010
That job was easier than yours.

139
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,337
All right. What's your price?

140
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:16,936
Like I said, we're pretty busy.

141
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:18,181
How much?

142
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,057
- Twelve hundred.
- Ag reed.

143
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:26,289
- And 39 dollars.
- Good enough.

144
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:28,700
And 52 cents.

145
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,220
Whoa. Cash. Cash.

146
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:53,013
- I'll pay you after we get back.
- Before we take off.

147
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:54,614
If you insist.

148
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,733
We've got a deal.

149
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:00,973
Not quite.
The fee included an airplane.

150
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:02,819
We got one of those.

151
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,215
I didn't see it.

152
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:06,179
Well, it's out there.

153
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,810
I'd still like to see it.

154
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,661
Follow me.

155
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:29,734
- That'?
- Yeah. It flies like a bird.

156
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:35,575
- That won't be ready in time.
- I can nail it together in 30 minutes.

157
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:40,019
It has to be tomorrow.

158
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:44,453
It'll be ready. Don't worry.
You just trust old Nick.

159
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:48,853
Run along. Don't worry.
It's under control.

160
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,012
I certainly hope so.

161
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:09,536
Remember, you just trust me.

162
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:26,618
That's the last time
I shovel your mess.

163
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:30,859
You did a good job.

164
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:33,615
Why do I always end up shoveling?

165
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:36,329
While you shoveled,
I made us $500.

166
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,415
- Five?
- She's paying me to fly to Mexico.

167
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,657
We lost more on the fish.

168
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:47,019
I know that. Hell, I'm ready
to pay my loss right now.

169
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:52,056
There's a check for $500 made out
by Chili Shuster himself.

170
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:57,020
Shit! Chili's doing 20
in Huntsville for bad checks.

171
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:02,849
What are you gonna do, condemn a man
because he was caught? Damn it.

172
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:08,011
According to this map,
we should be almost there.

173
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:11,458
- Any last-minute things to say?
- Like what?

174
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:16,616
- This guy we're gonna pickup?
- You've been well paid, Mr. Colton.

175
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,339
What the hell?

176
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,089
- That's him! Wait!
- Where'?

177
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,020
- You didn't pay me for this!
- Wait!

178
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:46,659
- Stop, you bastard!
- Let go! Let go!

179
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,651
For trying to escape.

180
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:14,492
For underestimating me.

181
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:25,736
You need companionship.
You will learn.

182
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:23,653
Yeah, what did I tell you?
Right on time.

183
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:33,697
You know what you can do.

184
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,737
What the hell happened?

185
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,021
Coward!

186
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:42,019
There were guys shooting at us.

187
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:46,135
- We could have done it!
- You almost got us killed.

188
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:49,418
- You were paid to get my husband!
- Not to get shot!

189
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,333
- Your husband?
- Yes.

190
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:53,373
Yes. And you were paid.

191
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:58,576
All I knew was it was a pickup.
I wasn't supposed to get shot at.

192
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:02,217
I didn't know it was your husband.
Got a slug in the oil line.

193
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:03,421
The oil line?

194
00:29:03,621 --> 00:29:05,418
We'll find someone else.

195
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:10,820
You listen to that shyster. Maybe
you'll manage to get somebody killed.

196
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:14,651
Want my advice? Talk to a pro.

197
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:16,539
Like you?

198
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:19,293
Yeah, like me!

199
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:23,211
You look at me
and see a bum in a funny hat.

200
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:27,340
But I am a pro.
I make my living on this border.

201
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:29,219
I know the ins and outs.

202
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:31,093
And you see this hat?

203
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:35,010
It's to strain the lousy gasoline
you sell there.

204
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,860
I'm not about to rip her off...

205
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:41,537
- ...and blow my reputation.
- We don't know you.

206
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,413
To hell with you!

207
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:46,454
- it's leaking like a sieve.
- I know.

208
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,493
Ann! Ann!

209
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:53,899
I don't care what it costs.
I want Jay out of there.

210
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:57,014
Mr. Colton, I want you to try again.

211
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:04,015
This time you tell me everything.
Why won't they let him out?

212
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,694
He's in prison.

213
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,099
Shit.

214
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:16,811
In that case, it'll cost you $2000.

215
00:30:17,061 --> 00:30:18,210
Preposterous!

216
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:21,259
That's 2000 to get him.
2000 on delivery.

217
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:22,701
No!

218
00:30:23,181 --> 00:30:26,730
- Can you guarantee delivery?
- I don't know what he did.

219
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:28,858
But there are ways.

220
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:30,170
He's innocent.

221
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:35,330
What's the difference?
It's just as tough and costs the same.

222
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:36,650
Give him 2000.

223
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,854
- We should discuss this.
- Give it to him.

224
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:41,216
Privately.

225
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:46,810
Nobody else has done anything.
He will try.

226
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:49,615
Maybe he can. Give it to him.

227
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:55,534
- How would you do It's?
- That's none of your business.

228
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:57,817
Give him the money.

229
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,215
So the hat is used for things...

230
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:14,340
other than straining
our poor Mexican gasoline.

231
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,580
Two thousand.

232
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:36,775
Hawk!

233
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:58,814
- They're paying us $2000?
- Right. She already gave me 1000.

234
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:00,938
1000 more when they're out.

235
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:04,930
We have to pay expenses,
maybe give a cut to Myrna.

236
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:09,971
- Okay to me.
- Spence. How are you doing?

237
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:13,537
- Giving out any traffic tickets?
- What do you want?

238
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:17,290
Just here to say hello
and maybe borrow your wife.

239
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:20,978
- You son of a bitch!
- Someone mention my name?

240
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:23,411
There she is.

241
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:27,660
Look at that. There's my...
His baby.

242
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:30,295
We got us a very big contract.

243
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:34,500
- All we need is the feminine touch.
- Beat it!

244
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,692
I want to hear it.
He's better than television.

245
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:42,095
He ain't to me.

246
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:47,335
Spencer, if you're going to make
sheriff, you've got to be friendly.

247
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:48,616
Right.

248
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:51,136
Myrna and me, we go way back.

249
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,817
Yeah, way back.
Like way back behind a haystack.

250
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,740
Every cop should have
a sense of humor.

251
00:32:58,981 --> 00:33:03,338
- What's this "touch of femininity"?
- I haven't worked it out yet.

252
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,930
But we need someone to wear a wig.

253
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:09,975
When I want to give money away,
I think of my friends.

254
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:14,060
- I'm here to give Myrna $100.
- 100'?

255
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:17,731
- She ain't interested.
- Suit yourself.

256
00:33:17,941 --> 00:33:20,933
It doesn't amount to more
than a little walk.

257
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:25,339
- And it's hard for Myrna to make $200.
- Yeah.

258
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:28,574
You said $100.

259
00:33:28,781 --> 00:33:31,693
That's $100 down
and $100 when it's over.

260
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,893
Yeah, we got the money too.
Show them, Nick.

261
00:33:35,261 --> 00:33:40,051
- Where do I take this little walk?
- It's not far from here. In Mexico.

262
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:44,017
- Mexico?
- Don't worry. Nick will fly her.

263
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:47,338
Bullshit! You ain't taking
my baby to Mexico.

264
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:49,492
I don't trust you with her.

265
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:52,335
Hold it. I want to hear this.

266
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:56,420
There's a young guy down there.
He's the clean-cut type.

267
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,094
He's locked up.

268
00:33:58,301 --> 00:34:01,338
All Myrna has to do
is wear this wig.

269
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,210
Make herself up so she
doesn't look like the clean...

270
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:09,420
young wife of the future sheriff
of our county.

271
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:14,658
- She'll look like a Mexican whore.
- Whore.

272
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:19,855
- Whore! You son of a bitch!
- All right, forget it.

273
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:23,337
I thought you could use
an extra $300.

274
00:34:23,941 --> 00:34:28,139
- Three hundred?
- For you, 350.

275
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:31,290
Spence, maybe..

276
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:35,896
Like my husband says,
I'm not interested.

277
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:39,218
Shit. That leaves me in a hole.

278
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:43,290
Well, hell.
It's not that tough.

279
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:47,050
With the right makeup,
anybody can look like a whore.

280
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:55,094
Yeah.

281
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,495
I think you're right, Myrna.

282
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,090
Exactly what I'm thinking.

283
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:09,296
You gotta be kidding.

284
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:14,300
Nick....

285
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:18,410
Oh, come on, Nick.
No, sirree-bob-dixie.

286
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:23,416
I'm not going to dress up in all
that garbage there. No, sir.

287
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:28,297
- You got the makeup?
- Yeah.

288
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,894
What cell is he in?

289
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:31,898
- Number 15.
- That's right.

290
00:35:32,101 --> 00:35:36,617
Tell him to use plenty of lipstick
and eye makeup.

291
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:41,093
Coming out, he's got to mix
with those whores. I'll be here.

292
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:44,577
I give him this wig and dress
and come back here?

293
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:49,297
That's right. But make sure
you take your makeup off.

294
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:52,615
- Get going.
- I wish this was you.

295
00:35:52,941 --> 00:35:56,058
Hawk, you might even get to like it.

296
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:02,298
Hawk, don't forget to swing it.

297
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:18,491
Wagner? You Jay Wagner?

298
00:37:44,581 --> 00:37:47,891
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?

299
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:51,053
Let him go!

300
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,696
Goddamn it, let him go!

301
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,297
Let him go!

302
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,536
This is the way I figure it.

303
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:13,295
We dig a tunnel just about here.

304
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,015
Then, we dig another tunnel there.

305
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:20,220
If they locate one, they won't think
to look for another.

306
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:22,497
- He'd be free.
- I don't know.

307
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:24,897
It will be expensive, Ann.

308
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:28,736
But it's better than wasting
money with those guys.

309
00:38:28,941 --> 00:38:32,092
Mr. Henderson, this is
a lot of trouble.

310
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:34,895
My husband might be safe right now.

311
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:40,255
Ann, I keep on telling you.
We'll never see Colton again.

312
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:45,573
- You double-crossing bastards.
- Where's Jay?

313
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,693
Shut up! I'm mad enough to bust you.

314
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:51,415
I got questions
and I expect answers.

315
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,652
You! What do you gain...

316
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:59,060
- ...if your husband stays in prison?
- You're out of line, Mr. Colton.

317
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:02,572
- You too, out.
- Now stop it!

318
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:06,376
- We're not leaving you with him.
- It's all right.

319
00:39:06,581 --> 00:39:09,300
All right. We'll be outside the door.

320
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:21,296
The answer to your question
is nothing. I stand to gain nothing.

321
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:24,015
Tell me what happened down there.

322
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,492
They beat up my best friend
and my partner.

323
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:32,293
They were waiting for us.
Somebody told them. They knew.

324
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:39,537
- They always know.
- Right, I think you told them!

325
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:42,892
I think you got drunk
and shot your mouth off.

326
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:46,690
I never get that drunk!
And what the hell is this?

327
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:50,776
That is a scale plan of the prison.

328
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:55,372
You can forget it because I'm
going back. I'm getting him out.

329
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:57,573
No, Mr. Colton.

330
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:01,531
You've had your chance and you failed.

331
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:03,260
Do it your way!

332
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:07,330
Go with their plan.
Whatever it is. What is It's?

333
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,020
Dig a tunnel's?

334
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:12,333
Maybe two, in case the first
is found out.

335
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:13,809
You know what?

336
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:17,895
They'll dig and they'll hit rock,
and they'll hit water.

337
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:21,019
They'll dig for two years,
and your husband...

338
00:40:21,261 --> 00:40:23,900
He'll be sitting there and rotting.

339
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,857
Maybe that's what you want.

340
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,220
No!

341
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:38,171
No, I want him out.
But I don't know what to do.

342
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:43,174
You keep coming to me
with your sure-fire schemes.

343
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:48,496
And I keep hoping and believing in you.

344
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:53,496
I'm paying and nothing seems to work.

345
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,330
Hell.

346
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:09,494
Come on, you don't have
to cry like that.

347
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,295
I don't like to see anybody crying.

348
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:14,130
Look.

349
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:22,821
You cut your hair.
Look at that.

350
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,292
It looks good.

351
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:29,537
I'll tell you what.
I'll take another whack at it.

352
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:32,733
- How much were they asking you for?
- $100,000.

353
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:36,095
One hundred thousand dollars!

354
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,495
I'm going to do it for nothing.

355
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:44,900
Nothing!

356
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,691
That's nothing up-front.

357
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:52,656
I'll only ask for half as much
on delivery. Fifty thousand dollars.

358
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:56,253
- You have another idea?
- Yeah.

359
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:58,099
What is It's?

360
00:41:58,661 --> 00:42:01,892
I don't know.
I ain't thought about it yet.

361
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,890
Forget about the preliminaries.

362
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:36,814
I know what makes it
go up and down.

363
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:40,531
Okay. How do you intend
to pay for your lessons?

364
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:42,692
Hurry. Bill.

365
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:49,099
I have a better idea.
I'll pay you for the lessons now.

366
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:56,494
This is made out for too much.
Just give me the balance.

367
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,732
We can't accept checks.

368
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:01,136
- You can't?
- No.

369
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:04,339
We'll settle up later.
You can trust me.

370
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:09,780
I'm uneasy about your grandson. It's
been a while since his escape attempt.

371
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,138
Relax, Mr. Cable.

372
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:15,737
Unlike yourself, some men
do eventually give up.

373
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,499
No, something is going on.

374
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,535
If there is, his wife will tell me.

375
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:23,373
I can't count on that.

376
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:28,297
He gets to the States, we can't
touch him. You know my instructions.

377
00:43:28,741 --> 00:43:32,131
All too well, Mr. Cable.
All too well.

378
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:51,094
Maybe next time
you'll tell me your plan.

379
00:43:51,341 --> 00:43:53,696
I don't have any more money on me.

380
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,497
You don't have to pay.

381
00:43:57,341 --> 00:44:00,890
All I want from you
is to take me with you.

382
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:03,410
You promise?

383
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:05,891
- Give me that bottle.
- Good.

384
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:13,297
I got a hell of a good idea.
Let's get drunk.

385
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:35,935
Goddamn stupid. You dressed that
big ape up to look like a whore!

386
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:40,697
- Who did you think you would fool?
- I'm so sorry, Jay.

387
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,136
This Colton thinks it's a joke.

388
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:47,939
It wasn't a joke.

389
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:52,538
And that "big ape" nearly lost
his life trying to get you out.

390
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:55,295
Well, they were paid, weren't they?

391
00:44:55,781 --> 00:44:58,500
Anyway, it was Cohen's idea.

392
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:01,690
How come I never get to meet him?

393
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:03,695
Jay....

394
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:09,611
I can't bring him here so that
everyone knows he's working for us.

395
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:12,890
Not anymore, he's not.

396
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:17,137
You pay him off.
That's the end of it.

397
00:45:19,661 --> 00:45:21,299
What happened?

398
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:23,897
I just cut it.

399
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:27,531
- Don't you like It's?
- It's different.

400
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:30,693
You used to always check
with me before.

401
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,414
I see.

402
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:36,697
What do you see?

403
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:44,334
Jay....

404
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:50,495
Jay, you think I'm sleeping
with someone. But I'm not.

405
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:56,733
Well, I notice things.

406
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:58,892
What things?

407
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:04,732
Every time you come
to visit, you're a little...

408
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:07,814
colder. A little bit more
matter-of-fact.

409
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:10,299
Matter-of-fact?

410
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:14,212
Are you still as horny
as you used to be?

411
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:17,295
This guy Colton.
How is He's?

412
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:21,696
- Does he give you a good hump?
- Oh, Jay!

413
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,939
- You're still my wife. Get these off.
- No.

414
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:30,292
Conjugal privileges.
You can be his whore...

415
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,692
- ...or my whore.
- No, Jay.

416
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:36,099
- You're my whore.
- Jay, no.

417
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:55,090
Shit!

418
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:16,014
Shit! Damn it!

419
00:47:21,461 --> 00:47:25,249
- Take it, take it!
- You got to understand this machine.

420
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:29,415
- Understand it? I'll break its neck.
- I'm afraid of that.

421
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,093
Wait a minute.

422
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:04,090
Some people can't chew gum
and tap at the same time.

423
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:05,529
I can.

424
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:08,739
It's only your third lesson.
Give it time.

425
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:10,972
Let's lay it on the line.

426
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:15,499
With two more weeks of lessons,
would I be as good as you?

427
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:17,976
No. You'll never be that good.

428
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:21,091
That's all I wanted to know.

429
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:28,699
Goddamn it, the way you come here
to borrow my wife.

430
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:34,170
- She ain't a lawn mower.
- You're right, Spence.

431
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:36,690
I admit I was out of line before.

432
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:41,696
I don't know how I could ask
your lady to pose as a whore.

433
00:48:41,901 --> 00:48:44,699
But I swear, this time it's nothing.

434
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:49,611
- What do you want?
- Like he says...

435
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:53,052
- Let him tell it.
- It's just clown there and back.

436
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:56,333
You get to go to the lake.
I get no day off.

437
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:59,334
Now this time she's right.
Fair is fair.

438
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:03,096
Spence, you're going
to make a thousand dollars.

439
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:07,974
- A thousand dollars for doing nothing.
- Practically nothing.

440
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:11,457
- No.
- Spencer, I got a say in this too.

441
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:17,252
You're the wife of an officer.
And you don't do nothing illegal.

442
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:19,213
Who says illegal?

443
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:22,174
If it wasn't,
you'd say what she has to do.

444
00:49:22,381 --> 00:49:25,976
- She has to get out of a car and yell.
- Yell what?

445
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:29,696
She has to yell that she's been raped.

446
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,660
You get out of here.

447
00:49:33,861 --> 00:49:36,898
Rape! Rape!
Come on, Spencer.

448
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,496
A thousand bucks just for that.

449
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:42,613
Just think.
You can buy fishing gear...

450
00:49:42,861 --> 00:49:45,011
make a payment on a new car...

451
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:47,496
maybe even a color TV.

452
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:54,895
What guarantee do we have
that we'll ever see the money?

453
00:49:55,981 --> 00:49:57,050
That.

454
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,895
A check for five hundred dollars.

455
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:07,734
- Don't cash it until we get back.
- Why not?

456
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:12,498
It has sentimental value.
Look at the date. It's two months old.

457
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:15,892
It's the last check
my best friend ever wrote.

458
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:18,569
I'd like to keep it
as long as I can.

459
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:22,410
I will let you hold it,
just to show my good faith.

460
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:32,100
<i>Okay?-</i>

461
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:39,491
But if you lay one hand
on my Myrna...

462
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:42,859
I'll tear your head off
and shit in it.

463
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:52,529
Take it from me, nothing ever happens in
this world until you're self-employed.

464
00:50:53,581 --> 00:50:57,335
I can't believe his luck.
Getting a chance like this.

465
00:50:57,581 --> 00:51:00,300
- You want him to fly that ore?
- What ore?

466
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:05,291
Sure. He can borrow one of the
choppers. He's got 10,000 hours.

467
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:09,494
- Thirty-six hundred and fifty.
- Thirty-six hundred and fifty.

468
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:12,895
I'll lay it on the line for you.

469
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:17,492
There's a lot of money here.
A lot of money involved.

470
00:51:19,301 --> 00:51:22,213
I'm offering you five percent.

471
00:51:23,341 --> 00:51:24,899
What do you say?

472
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:34,692
I say, hot damn!

473
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:54,133
I told you to come alone.

474
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:58,294
It was my fault, Mr. Colton.
I insisted.

475
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:19,694
Did you have to do that?

476
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,501
I don't trust him.
Did you bring them?

477
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:23,741
Yes.

478
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:28,901
The one on top is the most recent.

479
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:36,020
He might be hard to recognize.
He's changed so much.

480
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:38,292
He's changed?

481
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:40,693
That's great.

482
00:52:42,341 --> 00:52:43,341
Do this.

483
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:48,132
Tell him I want him in that
courtyard at 3:00 in the afternoon.

484
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:51,578
- One week from today.
- But he's a very sick man.

485
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:54,733
He's in the hospital.
I don't know if he can do it.

486
00:52:54,901 --> 00:52:58,177
He's got to be there.
Tell him to get better.

487
00:52:58,381 --> 00:52:59,894
Three o'clock.

488
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,577
Not five minutes before,
not five minutes after.

489
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:07,615
We'll wait for 10 seconds.
I leave with or without him.

490
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:14,292
To tell you the truth...

491
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:18,695
a part of me hopes it's
without him.

492
00:53:22,181 --> 00:53:23,773
How will you do it?

493
00:53:24,341 --> 00:53:27,492
If I tell you
and they're waiting for us...

494
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:29,293
what will I think?

495
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:33,491
You don't trust me.

496
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,941
We will fly him out by helicopter.

497
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:43,299
- But that's so dangerous.
- You're damn right it's dangerous.

498
00:53:46,661 --> 00:53:49,300
Nick, Hurry....

499
00:53:56,861 --> 00:53:58,499
Don't worry.

500
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:15,698
All yours.

501
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,095
I don't know.
It doesn't look right.

502
00:54:58,941 --> 00:55:01,580
- There's something wrong.
- You said blue.

503
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:05,490
By this picture, the attorney
general's is royal blue.

504
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:09,097
- Hell, blue is blue.
- Hey!

505
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:12,491
Holy shit!

506
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:17,494
What are you doing?
Who told you you could do that?

507
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:18,781
Do what?

508
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:21,697
Do what? That!

509
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:23,932
What will the boss say?

510
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:29,171
Probably thanks. Hell, we won't
even charge him for the paint.

511
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:31,299
Looks better, huh?

512
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:44,693
I'll tell you something,
there better be a big score in this.

513
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:48,256
You wait, buddy.
You wait!

514
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:55,651
I need a moment with him alone.

515
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:57,932
Sosa's my good friend.

516
00:55:58,181 --> 00:56:00,695
I know he is.
He's not going away.

517
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:02,694
Please.

518
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:08,295
I will be close by, amigo.

519
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:18,100
Jay.

520
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:20,499
Jay, listen to me.

521
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:25,092
Friday afternoon at 3:00,
Colton will get you out. Understand?

522
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:27,576
- 3:00.
- That's right.

523
00:56:27,781 --> 00:56:29,100
Which clay?

524
00:56:29,901 --> 00:56:32,540
- Jay, which day?
- Friday.

525
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:36,290
Right. In the courtyard.
You'll only have 10 seconds.

526
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:39,897
You must be there at 3:00.
And there's...

527
00:56:41,061 --> 00:56:44,656
There's one other thing,
Cohen's never seen you.

528
00:56:44,941 --> 00:56:47,136
- You must...
- You have to leave.

529
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:50,339
- I need a few more minutes.
- Okay, but come.

530
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:54,090
I have a right to speak
with my husband.

531
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:12,499
By tomorrow night you'll
be a real wife.

532
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:18,174
Yes, you will.

533
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:29,297
You be here.

534
00:57:50,941 --> 00:57:52,693
See you tomorrow.

535
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:48,812
Good afternoon.

536
00:59:49,061 --> 00:59:51,700
- Here you are.
- Hi.

537
00:59:51,901 --> 00:59:55,052
What is the purpose
of your visit into Mexico?

538
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:57,695
Not in front of the lady, huh?

539
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:00,934
We're just tourists here
for the weekend.

540
01:00:01,141 --> 01:00:03,974
- Welcome to Mexico.
- Oh, yeah. Si, sf.

541
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:09,096
- Just like old times, Myrna?
- Yeah, like old times, baby.

542
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:13,697
Spencer has good qualities.
I'm not knocking him.

543
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,131
But you men...
Who are you calling?

544
01:00:16,381 --> 01:00:18,690
Just trying to get a weather fix.

545
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:22,093
You're married to a cop,
and you can't even jaywalk.

546
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:24,093
Could you undo me?

547
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:28,939
You can't believe the guilt
I feel now.

548
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:33,094
- Goddamn!
- What'? What's the matter?

549
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:36,099
Chance of high winds tomorrow.

550
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:40,812
I know. And it might even
get stormy tonight.

551
01:00:41,061 --> 01:00:43,529
That's all I need, high winds.

552
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:45,931
- Nick?
- What?

553
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,371
I've been worried
about tomorrow.

554
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:52,494
I have to be convincing,
and I've never been raped.

555
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:57,253
- We should all be so lucky.
- What's that joke?

556
01:00:57,461 --> 01:01:00,021
A guy says, "So help me,
I'll rape you."

557
01:01:00,221 --> 01:01:03,099
The girl says, "So rape me,
I'll help you."

558
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:04,495
So?

559
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:07,540
So, rape me. I'll help you.

560
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:11,290
Oh, Myrna.

561
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,131
Is that all you got
on your mind?

562
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:19,330
You never had anything else on your
mind but that, since kindergarten.

563
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:21,697
I got something else now.

564
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:25,450
I know the chopper will lift off.
But landing it...

565
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:27,492
- Tell her, not me.
- Who?

566
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:32,092
- I see the way you look at her.
- You're crazy.

567
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:35,816
Never thought you'd stick
your neck out for a girl.

568
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:41,449
- I'm in this for the money.
- You're doing it for her.

569
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:44,096
So what? It's my neck!

570
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:47,099
Remember that when
you fail tomorrow...

571
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:50,896
and spend the next five years
in some beaner jail.

572
01:01:51,381 --> 01:01:53,941
You sure know how
to make a guy feel good.

573
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:55,893
How do you think I feel?

574
01:01:56,101 --> 01:02:00,299
You brought me here. I thought
we were going to have some fun.

575
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:05,614
Now if we did it, you'd think of her
and I'd think of Spencer.

576
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:10,218
Spencer and her would make
a lousy couple.

577
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:12,778
Go on, get out of here.

578
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:16,093
Save your strength for tomorrow.

579
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:24,058
Rape. I should be so lucky.

580
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:40,097
Come on, pile in.

581
01:02:43,061 --> 01:02:45,973
- Have you leveled with him yet?
- I will now.

582
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:48,570
- If he says no?
- How could he say no?

583
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:50,897
Who could say no to Nick?

584
01:03:01,061 --> 01:03:03,495
- Harvey.
- Hi, Nick.

585
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:06,898
- What did you do with the beer?
- It's down here.

586
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:10,691
These things, they either fly
or they don't.

587
01:03:10,941 --> 01:03:13,899
There's been a little
change of plan.

588
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:16,300
All right.

589
01:03:16,581 --> 01:03:21,211
Instead of lifting ore off a mountain,
we'll lift a guy out of jail.

590
01:03:23,741 --> 01:03:25,891
You son of a bitch.

591
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:27,780
Just hear me out.

592
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:31,417
This guy shouldn't be there.
He was framed.

593
01:03:31,661 --> 01:03:36,291
Look at it as a mission of mercy.
You can do it with your eyes shut.

594
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:41,291
- What happens if we get caught?
- If it was dangerous, would I go?

595
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:44,493
You're not listening.
I won't do it.

596
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:47,700
I never figured you'd turn chicken.

597
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:51,940
Chicken? Chicken doesn't have
anything to do with this.

598
01:03:52,181 --> 01:03:57,096
I'm something you never figured
with all your angles. I'm in love.

599
01:03:58,381 --> 01:03:59,939
You're what?

600
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,930
I'm getting married
in three weeks.

601
01:04:03,581 --> 01:04:08,291
I'll help you. I'll give you a part
of my share, Hawk will give you...

602
01:04:08,501 --> 01:04:10,935
- ...a part of his.
- What are you saying?

603
01:04:11,141 --> 01:04:14,975
- it's a wedding present.
- No, I said I'm in love.

604
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:17,456
I'm getting married. Nothing...

605
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:20,539
will keep me away
from that ceremony.

606
01:04:20,781 --> 01:04:23,215
Not you. Not some guy in prison.

607
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:27,010
Or all the goddamn money
in the world. Nothing!

608
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,615
- He means it.
- We'll cancel everything.

609
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:40,335
- No, I'll do it.
- You can't fly that.

610
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:41,940
I took lessons.

611
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:47,016
- You're good, but not in a chopper.
- Goddamn it, Hawk, shut up!

612
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:51,937
Those pepper-bellies have been
sticking it to us since we started.

613
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:56,572
It's my turn now. This is my show.
I do it on my own.

614
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:17,697
So, a miraculous recovery.

615
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:35,339
I just wanted
to get some fresh air.

616
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:39,130
Either you stay in bed,
or I'll send you to solitary.

617
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:41,178
For your health.

618
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,370
Ready.

619
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:04,775
Hawk and Myrna ought to be
getting there about now.

620
01:06:22,261 --> 01:06:25,776
Take it easy. Don't over-control.

621
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:27,970
Good luck.

622
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:45,501
Shit!

623
01:07:26,861 --> 01:07:28,977
Are you sure you know nothing?

624
01:07:29,181 --> 01:07:30,375
Nothing.

625
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:33,181
He talks. I don't understand.

626
01:07:33,421 --> 01:07:37,858
- And when his wife visits him?
- They whisper. I could not hear.

627
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:48,770
Somebody heard Wagner said,
"Friday afternoon."

628
01:07:49,581 --> 01:07:53,176
Friday afternoon? Today?

629
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:48,661
Yes?

630
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:51,770
How long do I have to sit here?

631
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:11,340
Until Friday's over.

632
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:05,175
One thousand and one.

633
01:13:05,621 --> 01:13:09,057
One thousand and two.
One thousand and three.

634
01:13:09,861 --> 01:13:13,058
- One, Mississippi. Two, Mississippi.
- Rape! Hey, you guys! Rape!

635
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:14,455
Three, Mississippi.

636
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:16,499
Four, Mississippi.

637
01:13:16,701 --> 01:13:18,419
Five, Mississippi.

638
01:13:18,621 --> 01:13:20,612
Six, Mississippi.

639
01:13:20,861 --> 01:13:24,456
One thousand and six.
One thousand and seven.

640
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:25,810
Rape!

641
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:27,973
Help! Help!

642
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:30,615
- Let's go.
- Help!

643
01:13:30,861 --> 01:13:33,011
Help! Rape! Rape!

644
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:37,371
One thousand and ten.

645
01:13:42,581 --> 01:13:44,811
Goddamn it, where are you?

646
01:13:52,021 --> 01:13:54,979
Get back! Get back! Get the hell back!

647
01:13:56,381 --> 01:13:58,178
Get away! Get away!

648
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:01,781
You're going to get hurt! Get back!

649
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,169
Get away!

650
01:14:30,421 --> 01:14:31,979
Now, you get back!

651
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:36,579
Get back! Get back!

652
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:38,979
Now, you get back!

653
01:14:40,261 --> 01:14:41,580
Get away! Get away!

654
01:14:42,781 --> 01:14:43,781
Get away!

655
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:47,177
- Jay Wagner?
- Colton?

656
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:48,974
Let's go!

657
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:28,093
Goddamn, man!

658
01:17:49,261 --> 01:17:52,970
Easy. Easy. You got it made.

659
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:55,369
Easy.

660
01:18:01,421 --> 01:18:04,413
Holy shit! Easy!

661
01:18:04,661 --> 01:18:07,573
Easy! You got it made!

662
01:18:07,781 --> 01:18:09,373
Come on, you fool!

663
01:18:15,661 --> 01:18:17,572
Easy, easy!

664
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:26,772
- I can't believe it. You made it.
- Goddamn right, Harve.

665
01:18:29,941 --> 01:18:32,375
Come on, Wagner. Let's go!

666
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:36,015
I can't believe it's still
in one piece.

667
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:38,980
You better take off.

668
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:41,975
There's a suitcase with clothes.

669
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:25,772
Here they come.

670
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:31,376
Move your ass, Hawk. Come on!
Son of a bitch!

671
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:39,973
Nick, the jeep!

672
01:21:07,861 --> 01:21:10,170
Just like old times, huh?

673
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:17,776
- Everybody comfortable?
- Yeah.

674
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:20,972
How fast can we go?

675
01:21:21,981 --> 01:21:24,495
We're doing it now.
Ninety miles an hour.

676
01:21:24,741 --> 01:21:26,777
Brownsville to Piper 87 Hotel.

677
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:30,371
Brownsville to Piper 87 hotel.
Oven

678
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:35,976
Go ahead. This is 87 Hotel.

679
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:39,816
Land at Brownsville
to clear customs and immigration.

680
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,370
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

681
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:45,372
Goddamn!

682
01:21:46,461 --> 01:21:47,894
What's that about?

683
01:21:48,141 --> 01:21:51,816
U.S. Customs wants me
to land in Brownsville.

684
01:21:52,061 --> 01:21:55,576
- You won't obey them, will you?
- I am.

685
01:21:56,381 --> 01:21:58,372
They're not looking for you.

686
01:21:58,661 --> 01:22:01,380
They think I got a plane
full of shit.

687
01:22:01,581 --> 01:22:03,776
We'll come up clean...

688
01:22:04,021 --> 01:22:06,171
and we'll be home free.

689
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:10,331
I'm driving to Brownsville.

690
01:22:10,941 --> 01:22:12,977
Ann, he said to wait here.

691
01:22:13,181 --> 01:22:15,979
You wait.
Something's gone wrong.

692
01:23:17,821 --> 01:23:20,972
- What do you say, Colton?
- Hey, Smitty.

693
01:23:21,381 --> 01:23:23,975
What did you bring this time?
Wetbacks?

694
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:27,570
My friends look like wetbacks?

695
01:23:31,981 --> 01:23:34,449
Bring your papers. Come with me.

696
01:24:03,861 --> 01:24:06,978
A little off your usual route,
aren't you?

697
01:24:07,821 --> 01:24:09,379
Mexico?

698
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:15,816
- What's the purpose of the flight?
- Pleasure, Smitty. Pleasure.

699
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:18,495
Pleasure? In Matamoros?

700
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:21,336
Take it where you can get it.

701
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:35,937
Just a minute.
Call from Mexico, Harry.

702
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:38,052
- Want it?
- You handle it.

703
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:35,169
Good evening.

704
01:25:35,661 --> 01:25:38,971
- Are you the customs man?
- No. Immigration.

705
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:42,771
Do you have Mr. Jay Wagner here?

706
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:45,579
Mister Wagner?

707
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:49,380
Come with me, sir.

708
01:25:49,581 --> 01:25:53,176
- What do you want with him?
- Just routine.

709
01:25:54,061 --> 01:25:55,574
Easy does it.

710
01:25:56,381 --> 01:25:57,780
There we are.

711
01:26:02,461 --> 01:26:04,417
Maybe you'd better wait.

712
01:26:04,661 --> 01:26:07,380
It's government business, sir.

713
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:11,179
A plane from Mexico.

714
01:26:11,581 --> 01:26:15,176
- Would you speak a little louder?
- Wait here.

715
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:19,973
Smitty, one of the passengers is sick.

716
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:23,694
He's really sick.

717
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:33,495
- What about a sick man?
- What'?

718
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:37,859
- You mentioned a sick man.
- There's a guy on the plane.

719
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:41,497
Bring him in. We'll look at him.
I'll keep these.

720
01:27:03,341 --> 01:27:06,174
- I think I know you.
- Really'?

721
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:08,579
I don't think so.

722
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:11,058
No, I remember.

723
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:14,015
- Get in the car, please.
- I remember.

724
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:17,180
Some immigration guy
came for Wagner.

725
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:18,900
- Where'?
- Over there.

726
01:28:07,261 --> 01:28:08,740
Jay Wagner!

727
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:57,410
- I already got one of those.
- I know. But this is a good one.

728
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:08,172
Thank you for my husband.

729
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:16,971
Nice to have met you, Colton.

730
01:30:52,181 --> 01:30:54,649
- Do we celebrate?
- How much we got?

731
01:30:57,621 --> 01:30:59,179
Fifty....

732
01:31:02,181 --> 01:31:06,777
Fifty thousand, thirty-eight dollars,
and fifty-three cents.

733
01:31:10,941 --> 01:31:12,772
I'll buy you a beer.
