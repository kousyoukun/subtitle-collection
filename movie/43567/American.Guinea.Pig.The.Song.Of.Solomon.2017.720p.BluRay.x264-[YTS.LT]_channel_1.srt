0
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,000
why would you tell people I am less to you 

1
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,800
your mom is that width

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,580
 N I

3
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,350
 
I'm talking to the authorities

4
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,640
 
I mean

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,680
 how can you even do this to me I mean 

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,990
I've never hit your mom

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,780
 
We've never fought

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,540
 
We've been loving Paris to you

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,990
 
You just can't say these things anymore

10
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,680
 
I mean

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,630
 the life we've given you is so good it has gone from god for god

12
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:51,870
 
So

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,230
 I mean

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,630
 I put my self through hell

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,440
 
Pay for 

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,280
people that I murdered my father by cutting his brake lines

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,200
 he got into a car wreck

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,950
 
It was

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,970
 I mean

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,110
 when we trying to tell

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,700
 what are you trying to accomplish

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,190
 
What do you condemn me for that

23
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,100
 there's nothing you can do that has everything you could

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,530
 
I don't know what to say anymore

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,280
 I mean

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,450
 it's affecting my job 

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,770
my life

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,820
 you just

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,850
 you just are trying to ruin my life

30
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,750
 and you can fix it

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,700
 
But you refused to

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,810
 
I

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,530
 this

34
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:25,800
 this is

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,330
 this is my only answer

36
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,190
 
Is this the option that I am 

37
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,620
I can't take this anymore

38
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,210
 I can't take him

39
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,650
 
I don't 

40
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,160
join bobbie

41
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,630
 when I got up

42
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,560
 this is what you want

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
 is it

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,630
 
But I just don't know my father

45
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,680
 who I never

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,930
 I would be thy name the kingdom come that will be done on earth is in heaven

47
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,830
 
Give us this day

48
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,820
 our daily bread

49
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,170
 and forgive us our debts

50
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,320
 as we 

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:02,250
we have vendors and do not only have this temptation with the limbs from rainbow 

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,500
what I 

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,330
he did it for me

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,340
 mother

55
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,060
 
He did it for what is to come 

56
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,330
good morning Mary

57
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,670
 I'm Dr Richards 

58
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,100
how are you doing today 

59
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,920
fine 

60
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,730
your mother asked me to come speak with you

61
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,210
 
I understand you're having difficulties after the passing of your father 

62
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,650
no 

63
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,540
she hasn't been herself at all

64
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,080
 doctor

65
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,970
 she's acting strangely

66
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,300
 
She does

67
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,730
 
These 

68
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,690
erratic things like she'll just in the other night

69
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,500
 walk out of the house

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,590
 
Just wander off 

71
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,930
and then I have to go look for her

72
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,950
 
I find her walking down the side of the road in her bare feet

73
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,270
 which is nightgown on

74
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:22,900
 
And then I'll

75
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,530
 I'll bring her home

76
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,550
 and she has no recollection of what even happened 

77
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,040
how long ago did the sleep walking start 

78
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,070
this has been going on for a few weeks 

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,690
about the time your husband passed 

80
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,770
a little bit before that 

81
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:35,910
Ms Khan

82
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,300
 sleepwalking is a symptom 

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
a ptsd 

84
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
after witnessing a traumatic events such as this 

85
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,900
it can manifest itself in sleepwalking 

86
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,360
visions

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,260
 voices 

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,510
just general disconnect

89
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,410
 anxiety 

90
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,420
well

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,220
 sometimes I hear voices

92
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,360
 I'll hear like voices coming from her room as if she's talking to somebody

93
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,260
 
But then when they go in there

94
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,500
 she's all by herself 

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,980
I think it might all be related 

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,680
to that as possible 

97
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
tell me about your father

98
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,040
 Mary 

99
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,700
or he was making me Mary

100
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,210
 you know

101
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,490
 that's not true 

102
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,140
are you sure that's reality and not just a dream 

103
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,740
I remember him touching me 

104
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,970
Mary 

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,200
tell me about your dreams 

106
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,210
I dream of fire 

107
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,670
fire

108
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,770
 like a mere mortal 

109
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,170
there's stature has never seen 

110
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,810
with flames higher than you could ever fathom 

111
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,940
and shades of red 

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,850
I would burn your soul 

113
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,880
you see

114
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,350
 that's what I'm talking about

115
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,100
 
Nonsense

116
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,630
 what is she talking about

117
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,490
 
I have no idea up woman 

118
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,980
Mary 

119
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,430
why are you treating me this way

120
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,330
 
I'm your mother

121
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,560
 
Don't talk to me like that

122
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,950
 I'm just trying to help you 

123
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,290
wearing tell me more about this fire 

124
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,770
sometimes I dream that was enslaved 

125
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,420
slave 

126
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,490
how so 

127
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,160
the king of babylon 

128
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,220
forced me to be a slave 

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,300
and help him build the tower of babel 

130
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,940
I don't understand 

131
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,060
it's more of a memory

132
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,620
 really 

133
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,910
I was free by the kings

134
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,660
 
Solomon 

135
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,840
but he was taught by god 

136
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,480
to force my kind into obedience 

137
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,840
so I was enslaved once again 

138
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,450
you forced us into building a temple 

139
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,630
are there more of you 

140
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,220
and eternal wave of demonic entities 

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,850
ready to take over at the end of time 

142
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,670
Mary

143
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,700
 I don't understand 

144
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,200
are you 

145
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,690
trying to tell me you're a demon 

146
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,090
of the first hierarchy 

147
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,340
when the antichrist is born

148
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,120
 I love freedom from this flesh 

149
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,570
sometimes the dream of horses 

150
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,500
but mostly just nightmares of college exams 

151
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,670
escaping 

152
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,600
where were you

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,410
 please

154
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:43,890
 
Sure 

155
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,290
okay 

156
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,330
I'm just a family elsewhere 

157
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,050
this is far more than unable to handle 

158
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,430
air 

159
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,960
call my colleague

160
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,900
 Dr Johnson 

161
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,850
he is much better equipped to help you with this

162
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,350
 
I'm just a family counsellor

163
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,280
 
Why would you say that

164
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,100
 
What do you think is wrong with her 

165
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,190
just calling 

166
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,740
the ordinary wishes to see you 

167
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,640
the ordinary 

168
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,690
I no longer work

169
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,350
 and personal

170
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,070
 
Salvation 

171
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,180
this is not negotiation 

172
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
tell him to make an appointment 

173
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,280
he has 

174
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,690
right now 

175
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,210
over there 

176
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,660
your excellency

 why didn't you come in

178
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,370
 
You know

179
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,600
 I must be invited 

180
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,600
we feel the exorcism of this young girl will be unlike the others 

181
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,390
when are they ever similar

182
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,530
 
You're actually lc 

183
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,590
I'm worried about clean water and food from my parish 

184
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,030
another possession case 

185
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,280
another case of mental illness 

186
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,500
this comes from high up

187
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,920
 
Like 

188
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,820
this is the highest priority 

189
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,210
your parish will be rewarded 

190
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,380
when revelations is at hand

191
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,670
 what uses one girl as opposed to the salvation of many 

192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
that girl could hold the key to all of heaven 

193
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,600
it is your task 

194
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,240
to save her soul 

195
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,370
I'll need to help her 

196
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,050
it's already been taken care of 

197
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,410
he's waiting for you 

198
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,080
as well as the family doctor 

199
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,900
and the mother of the possessed 

200
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,540
what is the name of the possessed girl 

201
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,480
it's Mary Elizabeth 

202
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,710
k tan 

203
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,680
whatever family

204
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,700
 what her father 

205
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
he killed herself in front of her 

206
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,160
do you know the name of the demon that is possessing the girl 

207
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,310
no 

208
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,110
but there's a docket in the car outside 

209
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,580
it may answer some of your questions on your way 

210
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,510
the family name is caiden 

211
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,130
the mother is Susan K

212
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,670
 
Can 

213
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,220
the doctor

214
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,390
 it is there for now 

215
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,650
deductor

216
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,190

and there's a nurse 

218
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,660
Margaret ivy 

219
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,960
but don't worry about her 

220
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,910
why would you say that 

221
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,770
she probably won't be there 

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,510
take these 

223
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:37,310
they're the coffin rosaries used for the saints 

224
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,610
I doubt it 

225
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,110
they were given to me by the most high 

226
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,650
keep these on you 

227
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,870
during your trial by fire 

228
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,100
you know

229
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,750
 most things made in the 15th century

230
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,080
 or fake 

231
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,860
those have only been used three times 

232
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,360
once

233
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,540
 by pope Stephen 

234
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520
once by Pope John

235
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,790
 the 7th and one by pope Boniface 

236
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,500
the three words posts in history 

237
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,930
and take this 

238
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,070
it's one of the golden bibles of manioc 

239
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,310
there's only three of these in existence 

240
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,620
actually

241
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,840
 there's only two left 

242
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,590
during last year's Easter service

243
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,580
 one was stolen 

244
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,950
wonderful

or anything you like 

250
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,420
just don't take my key of Solomon 

251
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,880
try not to get burnt

252
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,180
 
Like

264
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,760
how is the girl doing 

265
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,440
she spends the dated off and all

266
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,430
 no matter what we do

267
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,080
 no matter what say we give her

268
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,610
 she snaps out of it pretty quick

269
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,580
 
It's just enough time to change the sheets and get her cleaned up 

270
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,620
is cheating 

271
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,450
no food banks are pretty scares

272
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,650
 
I've been giving herself supplements iv solution to keep her hydrated 

273

don't disturb us for any reason 

280
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,150
no matter what you hear 

281
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,620
could put everybody's lives in danger 

282
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,010

I'm fine for trespass against us

this is not the father

449
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,400
 
This is a flesh which is corrupted

450
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,880
 
Week

454
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,830

456
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,390

457
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,460

459
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,480
 father

 my turn to preserve to you 

461
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,760
I love scattered into the wind

462
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,280
 them that are so foreign 

463
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,890
and I will bring the calamity from all side

464
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,880
 
With their 

465
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,040
savor 

466
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:36,020
and hazel shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever

467
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,960
 
There shall no man 

468
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,440
abide there 

469
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,800
nor any man

470
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,510
 
Well 

471
00:25:44,510 --> 00:26:10,890
thank you for meeting me 

472
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,830
would you like a drink 

473
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,940
I understand why you quit

474
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,710
 I don't think you understand really 

475
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,200
35 days

476
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,360
 with very little sleep 

477
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,210
two helpers died

478
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:40,400
 and the possessed committed suicide right after her salvation

479
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,530
 
How can a man of the cloth not quite 

480
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
now

481
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,920
 I prefer writing 

482
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,530
teaching others the true aspects of evil and not made up in their heads 

483
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,360
we have a young woman 

484
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,210
possessed 

485
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,650
she needs your help 

486
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,530
all of the possess need

487
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:02,860
 our help

488
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,080
 
I'm not putting my soul in jeopardy again 

489
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,010
for this

490
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,150
 he will

491
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:16,190
 
It's been passed to you through me from the most high 

492
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,050
I cannot do it 

493
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,820
my family is flying in from Croatia

494
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,010
 the wars out of control there

495
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,680
 
I was lucky enough to get them safe passage during all of this

496
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,750
 
You will need to find someone else

497
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,530
 
We have 

498
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,670
and he's going to fail 

499
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,690
so you present in a breeze to lose his sin father

500
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,500
 Blake

501
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,550
 and a new exorcist

502
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,250
 father Brandon

503
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,050
 so she should be saved

504
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,370
 she won't

505
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,330
 
How do you know

506
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,010
 we know

507
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,050
 just like we know it

508
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,730
 if need be

509
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,590
 you will do what you must 

510
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:06,110
like father Kincaid

511
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:12,290
 you are one of the seven you have met that specific sin

512
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,900
 and you countered it with a virtue

513
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,040
 
I've served my time 

514
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,590
your time is not up

515
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,190
 your not in the grave

516
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,700
 
Besides

517
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,490
 there's not that many war priests left

518
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,580
 
If I knew that being a soldier and then becoming a priest

519
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,290
 that I'd become an exorcist

520
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,240
 and that my soul would never rest

521
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,020
 I'd have stayed that 

522
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,820
used in the Vauxhall

523
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:51,150
 well lucky for us you did and we have no idea what demonic influences she has 

524
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,900
if I do this

525
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,000
 you will need to take care of my family 

526
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,080
we will take care of your family till the end of days 

527
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,400
that's not long enough

528
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,020
 it's long enough

529
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,330
 
Now look 

530
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,600
there's a car out front waiting for you 

531
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,600
you're about an hour and a half away 

532
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,540
read the docket in the car 

533
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,360
and take these 

534
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,480
they're made from the bones of the saints

535
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,640
 the rosary of death 

536
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,610
this is only to be used for the murder of the holy

537
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,770
 what are you not telling me the end of time 

538
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,610
once the anti Christ is born and he accepts his lot in life 

539
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,570
in 7 years 

540
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,160
Jesus comes back 

541
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,790
has he already been born 

542
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,930
we don't know 

543
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,590
you want him to be born don't you 

544
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,500
of course 

545
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,220
don't you 

546
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,600
may god have mercy on our souls 

547
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,250

Humans 

555
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,280
I am 

556
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,310

 temple 

558
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,580
I know the proper name 

559
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,630
very much so like there is 

560
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,660
we have been waiting to do what we were created for 

561
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,870
sorry dad

562
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,370
 I was there all along 

563
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,020
it's been written beyond ago

564
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,090
 wrapped in the violence of time that he paid 

565
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,340
and we 

566
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,790
we are forced to obey the laws 

567
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,110
as a world

568
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,680
 
And 

569
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,240
definition is final

570
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,570
 and salvation is about intervening 

571
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,460
yeah 

572
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,070
the test of humanity will be played out

573
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,210
 and both heaven and hell 

574
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,690
hi 

575
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,200
I got you

576
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,690
 you have no power over me

577
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,500
 
I will walk contrary unto you

578
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,930
 also in fury

579
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:56,040
 and I even I will chastise you seven times 

580
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,220
boy

581
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,060
 you are saying 

582
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,130
show me you are 

583
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:17,690
exploits of a father as corrupting 

584
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,710
and not forgive it 

585
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,690
wow 

586
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,740
another breathed 

587
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,720
ah

588
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,290
 come in 

589
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,690
are they still here upstairs 

590
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,020
I'm father Corbyn

591
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,470
 or they felt

592
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,850
 performed in the exorcism

593
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,210
 yes

594
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,750
 but they told us

595
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,700
 not disturb them 

596
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,730
I'm going to disturb you

597
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,900
 
Do you believe in god

598
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,220
 
What 

599
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,480
do you believe in god 

600
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:34,960
no 

601
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:35,680
now

602
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,250
 I don't 

603
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,750
so the poor girl that's being exercised by two priests in your home

604
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,360
 and you're telling me you don't believe 

605
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,940
I suggest you both find god real quick 

606
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,130
there are more candles upstairs

607
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,610
 
You're probably going to need them 

608
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,730
the loveliest trick of the devil 

609
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,320
has been to persuade that he does not exist 

610
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,770
the devil needs no more tricks 

611
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,470
is nothing left to hide 

612
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,320

613
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,240

617
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,810
it will be done 

618
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,230
I remember

619
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,170
 it is in heaven 

620
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,290

621
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,340

622
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
and forgive us our trespasses 

623
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,970
as we forgive those who trespass against us 

624
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,690
and lead us not into 

625
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,310
and deliver us from evil 

626
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,040
for yours is the kingdom

and forgive us so trespasses

640
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,590

641
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,290

the majesty of Christ

 even unto death 

728
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,760
he who was built his church on the firm rock

729
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,480
 and declared that the gates of hell shall never prevail against her

730
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,530
 because he will dwell with her all days even to the end of the world 

731
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,220
the sacred sign of the cross commands thee 

732
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,790
as does also the power of the mysteries of the Christian faith

the glorious mother of god

734

00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,040
she who

737
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,150
 by her humility

738
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,670
 and from the first moment of her immaculate conception

 Peter and Paul and the other apostles command thee 

742
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,790
the blood of the martyrs and the pious intercession of all the saints command

743

I know you will not listen to me 

746
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,880
but very 

747
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,230
do you want 

748
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,020

I'm going to be these bad 

753
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,400
yet a dog will return to his own law 

754
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,730

00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:13,160
so 

758
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,130

759
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,150
but yet

I like him 

771
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:45,650
it means when you turn in 

772
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,950
hi

773
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,260
 I'm never going to be 

774
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,070

780
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:39,810

00:51:59,330 --> 00:51:59,750
yeah 

782
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,270
yes 

783
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:29,760
yeah 

784
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,640
what do you give your child 

785
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,520
and what 

786
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,200
do you like the gods

787
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,860
 
Judge 

788
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,340
but to Hollywood 

789
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,620
now I baptize you in the blood of the father 

790
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,820
and the 

791
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,730
and the holy spirit 

792
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,740
may the blood of his servants

793
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,890
 
When you 

794
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:54,800
ha 

795
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,950
how are you okay

796
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,420
 he's hurting me 

797
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:19,690
hell

798
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,770
 may 

799
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,280
oh god 

800
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:30,510
how your dog is fighting for eternal soul 

801
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,660
we have three dead priests

802
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,970
 
My nurse 

803
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,240
look at me

804
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:39,120
 
I realized 

805
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,090
how can we look at me 

806
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,750
okay 

807
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:44,860
it's not over

808
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,400
 yeah 

809
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,700
daughter needs you 

810
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,130
how is she sorry 

811
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,490
we have about 20 minutes before she steps out

812
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,650
 we need to get rid of all these bodies

813
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,130
 
Glaus

814
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:13,280
 we can 

815
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,710
we just have to tie up 

816
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,770
we have that

817
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,110
 at least get rid of the bodies 

818
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:19,590
another is coming 

819
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,210
how do you know that 

820
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,160
you have to understand 

821
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,330
these are the end of days 

822
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,420
demonic possession has begun to run rampant 

823
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,870
people are dying of starvation and disease

824
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:42,470
 and war 

825
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:46,340
I've done my time 

826
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,720
I have a small parish

827
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,540
 it's getting smaller every day 

828
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,160
we're all hungry

829
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:52,730
 and Thursday

830
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:53,750
 and close to death 

831
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,780
this has been foretold

832
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,400
 can't even understand that 

833
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,390
I do

834
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:58,780
 I just

835
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,730
 I wasn't expecting it on my watch 

836
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:05,020
it's happening on all of our watches 

837
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,360
drought 

838
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,760
flag 

839
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,140
starvation 

840
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:10,830
loss of faith 

841
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,880
demonic possession 

842
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,010
I lost 

843
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,790
my last exorcism 

844
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,020
I no longer have a soul 

845
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,920
I have forever condemned it to damnation in hell

846
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,520
 
Fire 

847
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,660
I'm still a puppet of the lord

848
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,790
 but I am empty 

849
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,520
nobody else knows that 

850
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,150
do you still believe 

851
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:38,960
I don't have to believe

852
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,310
 because I know 

853
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,920
I know

854
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,070
 and I lost 

855
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,820
there's a difference between knowing 

856
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,670
in believing 

857
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:53,100
that girl died in her possession 

858
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:54,190
and because of that

859
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,660
 I can no longer perform the ritual

860
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,740
 because my soul was taken a day 

861
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,560
that exorcism was not okayed by the Vatican

862
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,140
 and it was not greenlit 

863
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,830
by me 

864
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,960
you came upon it 

865
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,630
you jumped into it 

866
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,940
you lost 

867
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,180
I understand this 

868
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,590
what are you saying 

869
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,980
I'm saying that you weren't ordained to do it 

870
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,020
you had no right to try 

871
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,460
and you did 

872
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,820
I lost the battle

873
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,910
 I forever condemn myself to this position

874
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:31,860
 
Now you have a chance to redeem yourself 

875
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,150
and save a soul

876
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,240
 it is very unique and special to us 

877
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,760
I do what I was supposed to do 

878
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,030
yes 

879
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:42,450
you did 

880
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,120
without our knowledge or blessing 

881
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,350
you failed 

882
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,730
is a man 

883
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:52,330
not as a priest of the church

884
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,580
 I am a priest of the church

885
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,440
 
You are only a man

886
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,740
 
Unless we send you sent me to Bangladesh

887
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,320
 you were sent there to save souls

888
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,900
 not deliver them the same thing

889
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,200
 
No

890
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:05,750
 it isn't 

891
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,020
specific jobs are for specific beans

892
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,620
 and now I have a specific job for you

893
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,820
 
It doesn't matter 

894
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,470
I lost the battle between good and evil 

895
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,240
you didn't have our ok to do it 

896
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,460
I know the law

897
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,960
 I know the rules

898
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,850
 
An exorcism is one on one

899
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,220
 the loser goes to hell 

900
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,140
the battle 

901
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,190
between heaven and hell 

902
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,410
his rage

903
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,600
 for centuries 

904
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,370
you're not the first priest to have lost 

905
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:43,040
but you're becoming the priest who refuses redemption 

906
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,850
how have I refusing 

907
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,150
sending a soul was priest into an exorcism

908
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,980
 
It's like throwing a strong man into a fire 

909
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,990
you're the only one that can do this 

910
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,350
this is exactly what we need 

911
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,230
wouldn't do it if it were a mile away 

912
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,510
good 

913
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,530
because we're just a block away 

914
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,760
you set me up 

915
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:11,430
which to understand the implications of this 

916
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,540
yes

917
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,490
 we do 

918
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,610
either a new soul walks out of that house 

919
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:20,750
but we all go to hell 

920
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,620
you're the hill

921
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,100
 Mary

922
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,120
 
Pastel 

923
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,110
3 priests

924
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,060
 you've gone through those doors before

925
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:28,450
 
You 

926
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,090
and none of them 

927
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:32,490
have come out 

928
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,130
if you can't say that

929
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:35,640
 girl 

930
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,090
no one can 

931
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,780
the house is down this dirt road

932
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,740
 it's on the left

933
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,130
 the dark brown house 

934
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:46,770
inside

935
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,620
 you'll find everything that you need 

936
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,090
and here

937
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:51,860
 take these 

938
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,170
one is usually enough 

939
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,820
I don't see what it'll hurt 

940
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,130
use them like the sands of Jerusalem 

941
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,850
and take this

942
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,210
 you'll need it for the ritual 

943
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,270
god bless you

944
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,210
 my friend 

945
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,910
you're going to need it 

946
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,280
I'll pull yourself together

947
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,850
 the family's going to need you 

948
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,590
I'm father Powell 

949
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:57,460
Dr johnston 

950
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,160
another priest 

951
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,810
where are the others 

952
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:01,760
all dad

953
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,710
 we put them in the laundry room

954
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,120
 
We didn't know what else to do 

955
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,060
is their equipments to upstairs

956
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:07,600
 
The work 

957
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,720
crosses

958
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,320
 candles

959
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,010
 yeah

960
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:10,460
 yes

961
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:10,700
 
Yes

962
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,350
 we didn't move that we didn't do anything with that

963
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:12,910
 we were 

964
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:13,640
afraid to 

965
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,170
if that was wise 

966
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,050
he should move an extra to call her until the ritual is complete 

967
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,960
or this is the end

968
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,570
 isn't it 

969
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,210
no matter how much darkness 

970
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,710
there would be no darkness without light 

971
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,580
are you both Christian 

972
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,720
have you been baptized

973
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,440
 
Do you believe 

974
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,510
no

975
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,110
 father 

976
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,520
and his holy water upstairs 

977
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,490
2 flasks of it 

978
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,340
no matter what you do 

979
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,000
do not go upstairs 

980
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,350
and no matter what you do 

981
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,960
do not come near me unless I say it's ok 

982
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:10,690
yes

983
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:11,200
 father 

984
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,360
he eternal souls

985
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,300
 depend upon it 

986
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,330
father 

987
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:46,430
why am I 

988
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,100
father 

989
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,860
I can even come 

990
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,590
I won't be done 

991
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,910
fairchild brand 

992
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:46,600
responses 

993
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:50,220
for those who trespass against us 

994
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:52,930
just not 

995
01:05:52,930 --> 01:06:03,320
good 

996
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:05,800
kingdom 

997
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,510
the power 

998
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,380
and the quarry 

999
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,870
I 

1000
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,780
overcoming father 

1001
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,630
long time 

1002
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,210
and I believe 

1003
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,780
you might remember it

1004
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,090
 
We won 

1005
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:51,170
I freely 

1006
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,030
gave up something there 

1007
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,610
you were never there 

1008
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,780
well

1009
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,320
 similar moving 

1010
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:05,150
it's not often that we make a priest 

1011
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,090
father 

1012
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:08,220
fun 

1013
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,650
jump ahead 

1014
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:13,220
no 

1015
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,480
the same old tricks 

1016
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,460
you realize your world is dying 

1017
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:21,740
no

1018
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:28,960
 running water is now a precious commodity 

1019
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,450
this is run rampant

1020
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:32,800
 birth defects

1021
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,370
 murder

1022
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,660
 rape and sacred language 

1023
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,750
you're kind 

1024
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:38,640
kill 

1025
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:40,500
more 

1026
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:41,480
boy 

1027
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,860
you disgrace your father 

1028
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,120
and more than you could ever 

1029
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:53,750
who are you 

1030
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,580
one of the following 

1031
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,530
to think that you could change

1032
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:57,950
 
What I 

1033
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:03,130
your words 

1034
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,270
empty 

1035
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,110
just saw 

1036
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:07,920
really 

1037
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,270
I don't think we should 

1038
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:16,810
do we need to discuss short English 

1039
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:17,560
no choice 

1040
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,650
I had to do it 

1041
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,460
yeah 

1042
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,880
the power of Christ 

1043
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,250
compels you 

1044
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,750
the power does a lot of things

1045
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,860
 and compelling is not one of them

1046
