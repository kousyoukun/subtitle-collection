0
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,600
why would you tell people I'm molested

1
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:26,990
 
You 

2
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,810
your mom is that width

3
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,620
 N I

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,360
 
I'm talking to the authorities

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,650
 
I mean

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,670
 how can you even do this to me I mean 

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,000
I've never hit your mom

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,790
 
We've never fought

9
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,160
 we've been loving parents to you

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,880
 and you just can't say these things anymore

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,690
 
I mean

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,960
 the life we've given you is so good

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,160
 it just goes from god

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,730
 for god's sakes

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,030
 
I mean

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,610
 I put my self through hell

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,450
 pay for all 

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,290
people that I murdered my father by cutting his brake lines

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,210
 he got into a car wreck

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:01,960
 
It was

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,950
 I mean

22
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,120
 would we trying to tell

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,710
 what are you trying to accomplish

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,080
 
What you condemn me for that there's nothing you can do that has anything you could

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,290
 
I don't know what to say anymore

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,460
 seems infecting my job 

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,080
my life

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,010
 just you just are trying to ruin my life

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,760
 
You can fix it

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,280
 
But you refused to

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,510
 
I like this

32
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,780
 
This is

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,340
 this is my only answer

34
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:27,790
 
Is this

35
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,220
 the option that I have 

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,620
I can't take this anymore

37
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,460
 I can't take it

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,640
 
I don't 

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,170
Bobby

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,610
 when I got up

41
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,570
 this is what you want

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:39,870
 is it 

43
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,760
but I don't know my father

44
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,130
 I know I would be thy name

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,940
 the gingham gun that will be done on earth is in heaven

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,680
 
Give us is their daily bread

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,060
 and forgive us our debts

48
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,430
 as we forget our debtors and do not leave us

49
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,120
 
Citizen with the numerous involved 

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,520
what 

51
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,510
he did it for me

52
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,830
 
Mother 

53
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,900
he did it for what is to come 

54
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,330
good morning Mary

55
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,670
 I'm Dr Richards 

56
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,100
how you doing today 

57
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,920
fine 

58
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,710
your mother asked me to come speak with you

59
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,230
 
I understand you're having difficulties after the passing of your father 

60
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,650
no 

61
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,540
she hasn't been herself at all

62
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,080
 doctor

63
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,970
 she's acting strangely

64
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,300
 
She does

65
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,720
 
These 

66
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,710
erratic things like she'll just in the northern night

67
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,490
 walk out of the house

68
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,590
 
Just wander off 

69
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,930
and then I have to go look for her

70
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,950
 
I find her walking down the side of the road in her bare feet

71
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,270
 which is certain night gown on

72
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,260
 
And then I'll I'll bring her home and she has no recollection of what even happened

73
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,050
 
How long ago did the sleep walking start 

74
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,070
this has been going on for a few weeks 

75
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,700
so how about the time your husband passed 

76
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,810
a little bit before that 

77
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,920
Ms Khan

78
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,300
 sleepwalking is a symptom 

79
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,700
a ptsd 

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
after witnessing a traumatic events such as this 

81
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,880
it can manifest itself in sleep

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,890
 
Walking 

83
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,360
visions

84
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,260
 voices 

85
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,500
just general disconnect

86
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,430
 anxiety 

87
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,420
well

88
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,220
 sometimes I hear voices

89
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,360
 I'll hear like voices coming from her room as if she's talking to somebody

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,260
 
But then when they go in there

91
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,500
 she's all by herself 

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,980
I think it might all be related 

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,790
to that

94
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,690
 it's possible 

95
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
tell me about your father

96
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,070
 Mary 

97
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:15,850
or you

98
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,510
 because he was making me 

99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,690
Mary

100
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,200
 you know

101
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,500
 that's not true 

102
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,140
are you sure that's reality and not just a dream 

103
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,740
I remember him touching me 

104
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,970
Mary 

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,220
tell me about your dreams 

106
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,260
I dream of fire 

107
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,660
fire

108
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,740
 like a mere mortal 

109
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,130
of your stature has never seen 

110
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,820
with flames higher than you could ever fathom 

111
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,940
and shades of red 

112
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,830
I would burn your soul 

113
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,730
you see

114
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,840
 that's what I'm talking about

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,100
 
Nonsense

116
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,630
 what is she talking about

117
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,500
 
I have no idea up 

118
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,980
Marie 

119
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,440
why are you treating me this way

120
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,340
 
I'm your mother

121
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,570
 
Don't talk to me like that

122
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,950
 I'm just trying to help you 

123
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,350
wearing tell me more about this fire 

124
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,200
sometimes I dream

125
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,780
 I was enslaved 

126
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,440
slaved 

127
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,230
mm 

128
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,500
how so 

129
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,180
the king of babylon 

130
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,220
forced me to be a slave 

131
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,300
and help him build the tower of babel 

132
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,920
I don't understand 

133
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,060
it's more of a memory

134
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,640
 really 

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,320
I was freed by the kings

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,920
 Solomon 

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,840
but he was taught by god 

138
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,540
to force my kind into obedience 

139
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,890
so I was enslaved once again 

140
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,450
you forced us into building a temple 

141
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,630
are there more of you 

142
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,210
and eternal wave of demonic entities 

143
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,800
ready to take over at the end of time 

144
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,650
I don't understand 

145
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,670
are you trying to tell me you're a demon 

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,090
of the first hierarchy 

147
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,340
when the antichrist is born

148
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,080
 I love freedom from this flesh 

149
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,580
sometimes the dream of horses 

150
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,500
but mostly just nightmares of college exams 

151
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,710
escaping 

152
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,600
for with you

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,410
 please

154
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:43,890
 
Sure 

155
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,310
I'm just a family elsewhere 

156
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,050
this is far more than unable to handle 

157
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,430
air 

158
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,960
call my colleague

159
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,900
 Dr Johnson 

160
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,850
he is much better equipped to help you with this

161
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,350
 
I'm just a family counsellor

162
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,280
 
Why would you say that

163
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,110
 
What do you think is wrong with her 

164
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,200
just calling 

165
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,730
the ordinary wishes to see you 

166
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,630
the ordinary 

167
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,430
I no longer work

168
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,880
 and personal

169
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,080
 
Salvation 

170
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,190
this is not negotiation 

171
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,970
tell him to make an appointment 

172
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,280
he has 

173
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,690

 why didn't you come in

177
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,370
 
You know

178
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,610
 I must be invited 

179
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,590
we feel the exorcism of this young girl will be unlike the others 

180
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,390
when are they ever similar

181
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,540
 
You're actually lc 

182
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,630
I'm worried about clean water and food from my parish 

183
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,040
another possession case 

184
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,250
another case of mental illness 

185
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,840
his comes from high up

186
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,050
 
Like 

187
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,820
this is the highest priority 

188
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,230
your parish will be rewarded 

189
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,370
when revelations is at hand

190
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,640
 what uses one girl as opposed to the salvation of many 

191
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
that girl could hold the key to all of heaven 

192
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,620
it is your task 

193
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
to save her soul 

194
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,320
I'll need to help her 

195
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,050
it's already been taken care of 

196
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,410
he's waiting for you 

197
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,080
as well as the family doctor 

198
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,900
and the mother of the possessed 

199
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,540
what is the name of the possessed girl 

200
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,480
it's Mary Elizabeth 

201
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,210
k 

202
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,680
whatever family

203
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,700
 what her father 

204
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
he killed herself in front of her 

205
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,160
do you know the name of the demon that is possessing the girl 

206
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,300
no 

207
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,110
but there's a docket in the car outside 

208
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,560
it may answer some of your questions on your way 

209
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,500
the family name is caiden 

210
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
the mother is Susan K

211
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,690
 
Can 

212
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,220
the doctor

213
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,390
 it is there for now 

214
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,180
conductor David 

215
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,060
and there's a nurse 

216
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,640
Margaret ivy 

217
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,960
but don't worry about her 

218
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,880
why would you say that 

219
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,770
she probably won't be there 

220
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,110
take these 

221
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,300
they're the coffin rosaries used for the saints 

222
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,600
I doubt it 

223
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,100
they were given to me by the most high 

224
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,650
keep these on you 

225
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,880
during your trial by fire 

226
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,380
you know

227
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,090
 most things made in the 15th century

228
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,390
 or fake 

229
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,860
those have only been used three times 

230
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,360
once

231
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,530

232
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520

 posts in history 

236
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,930
and take this 

237
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,030
it's one of the golden bibles of manioc 

238
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,310
there's only three of these in existence 

239
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,620
actually

240
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,830
 there's only two left 

241
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,590
during last year's Easter service

242
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,580
 one was stolen 

243
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,970

or anything you like 

249
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,420
just don't take my key of Solomon 

250
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,180
try not to give birth

251
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,600
 
Like

how is the girl doing 

264
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,800
she spends the dated off and all

265
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,820
 no matter what we do

266
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,530
 no matter what say we give her

267
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,880
 she snaps out of it pretty quick

268
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,580
 
It's just enough time to change the sheets and get her cleaned up 

269
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,600
is eating 

270
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,880
no

271
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,440
 food banks are pretty scarce

272
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,650
 
I've been giving herself supplements iv solution to keep her hydrated 

273
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:22,920

don't disturb us for any reason 

279
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,190
no matter what you hear 

280
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,600
could put everybody's lives in danger 

281
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,990
father 

282
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,590
I understand you have performed an exorcism 

283
00:15:59,770 --> 00:15:59,980

287
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,140
you understand the law of outcomes 

288
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,340

I don't mean anything 

301
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,960
I'm fine

and lead us not into temptation 

304
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,110
but deliver us from evil 

305
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,620
oh god and father of our lord Jesus Christ

306
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,530
 
We invoke thy hold that one and begin from the time by the intercession of the mother of god

a child molester 

403

I think 

404
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,210
and adulterer

 with no belief 

406
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,380
little bags of flesh 

407
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,860
trying to stop the inevitable as a world burns

408
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,870
 and less so from the great man 

409
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,290
silence 

410
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,440

do not talk to her and told her stay with her prayer

414
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,480
 
She needs 

415
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:07,860
god

416
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,630
 the father commands thee god

417
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,950
 the son commands thee

418
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,640
 
God

419
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,080
 the holy ghost commands thee 

420
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,320
the majesty of Christ 

421
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,970

422
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,790

427
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,560
for his mercy

428
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,890
 endureth forever 

429
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,360
air prayers are like eyes to me 

430
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,030
cold and unyielding

431
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,630
 shallow 

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,140
unsettling 

433
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,480
in the body I possessed 

434
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,150
yet true

435
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,560
 fly through

436
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,710
 
And 

437
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,970
at all 

438
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:12,750
no way out of the body of Mary Elizabeth king was father upon mccloud 

439
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,110

440
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,600
doctor 

441
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:22,890
mm 

442
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,660
her mouth is filled with curses

443
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,880
 lies in violence 

444
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,550
under the tongue 

445
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,310
and leave 

446
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:40,240
it's okay 

447
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,410
the lord sent me

448
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,970
 why do you think I'm in this body 

449
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,720
no one trust father to post 

450
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,400
this is not the father

451
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,950
 
This is a flesh which is corrupted 

452
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,240
my god doc know that in the day you eat there 

453
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,150

454
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,750

455
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,860
yeah 

456
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,300
I went to the soul 

457
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,400
xiaomi 

458
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,750
so 

459
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,110

460
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,460

463
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,210
 them that are the foreigner 

464
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,910
and I will bring the calamity from all side

465
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,840
 
With their 

466
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,290
sand

467
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:27,530
 the lord 

468
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:36,020
and hazel shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever

469
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,950
 
There shall no man 

470
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,380
abide there 

471
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,110
nor any man 

472
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,120
thank you for meeting me 

473
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,080
would you like a drink 

474
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,640
I understand why you quit 

475
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,980
I don't think you understand 

476
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,790
really 

477
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,660
35 days with very little sleep

478
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:38,680
 two helpers died and the possessed committed suicide right after her salvation

479
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,930
 
How can a man of the cloth 

480
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,750
not quite now

481
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,920
 I prefer writing 

482
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:54,700
teaching others the true aspects of evil and not made up in their heads 

483
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,370
we have a young woman 

484
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,140
possessed 

485
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,620
she needs your help 

486
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,870
all of the possessed need our help

487
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,360
 
I'm not putting my soul in jeopardy again 

488
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,000
for this

489
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,140
 he will

490
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,030
 
It's been passed to you through me 

491
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,830
from the most high 

492
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,120
I cannot do it 

493
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,840
my family is flying in from Croatia

494
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,620
 the wars out of control there 

495
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,080
I was lucky enough to get them safe passage during all of this

496
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,790
 
You will need to find someone else

497
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,550
 
We have 

498
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,910
and he's going to fail

499
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:38,700
 
So you present in a breeze to lose his sin father

500
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,240
 Blake 

501
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,560
and a new exorcist

502
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,260
 father Brennan

503
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,030
 
So she should be saved

504
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,910
 she won't 

505
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,040
how do you know we know 

506
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,050
just like we know it

507
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,730
 if need be

508
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,790
 you will do what you must 

509
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,540
like father Kincaid 

510
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,690
you are one of the seven 

511
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,500
you have met that specific sin 

512
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,900
and you countered it with a virtue

513
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,990
 
I've served my time 

514
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,600
your time is not up

515
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,240
 your not in the grave 

516
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,690
besides

517
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,060
 there's not that many war priests left 

518
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,460
if I knew that being a soldier and then becoming a priest

519
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,170
 that I'd become an exorcist

520
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,150
 and that my soul would never rest

521
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,820
 I'd have stayed that atheist in the foxhole

522
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,030
 
Well

523
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,350
 lucky for us

524
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,300
 
You did 

525
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:50,000
and we have no idea what demonic influences she has 

526
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,900
if I do this

527
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,780
 you will need to take care of my family

528
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,500
 
We will take care of your family till the end of days 

529
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,390
that's not long enough

530
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,010
 it's long enough

531
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,250
 
Now look 

532
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,180
there's a car out front waiting for you

533
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,570
 
You're about an hour and a half away 

534
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,770
read the docket in the car 

535
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,330
and take these 

536
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,980
they're made from the bones of the saints 

537
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,830
the rosary of death 

538
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,620
this is only to be used for the murder of the holy

539
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,730
 what are you not telling me the end of time 

540
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,600
once the anti Christ is born and he accepts his lot in life 

541
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,660
in 7 years 

542
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,520
she comes back

543
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,380
 has he already been more

544
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,460
 we don't know 

545
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,010
you want him to be born don't you 

546
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,430
of course 

547
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,640
don't you 

548
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:16,600
may god have mercy on our souls 

549
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,370

565
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,640
sorry dad

566
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,370
 I was on a long 

567
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:12,340
it's been written beyond to go around in the violence of time that he paid

568
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,370
 
And we 

569
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,740
we are forced to obey the law 

570
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,070
as a world 

571
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,250
damnation is final

572
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,550
 and salvation is by dreaming 

573
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,050
the test of humanity will be played out

574
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,180
 and both heaven and hell 

575
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,690

I got you

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,000
 you have no power over me 

579
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,480
I will walk contrary unto you

580
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,910

581
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:51,930

583
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:53,670
 Jeff 

584
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,070
as you 

585
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,020
the boy said 

586
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,960
xiaomi mi 

587
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:17,820
below is a of father as corrupting 

588
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,690
and not forgive it 

589
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,790
another priest 

590
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,290
come in 

591
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,710
are they still here upstairs 

592
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,720
I'm father Corbyn

593
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,140
 or they felt

594
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,980
 performed in the exorcism

595
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,850
 yes

596
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,690
 but they told us not just throw them 

597
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,730
I'm going to disturb you

598
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,900
 
Do you believe in god

599
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,200
 
What 

600
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,470
do you believe in god 

601
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:34,990
no 

602
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:35,680
now

603
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,250
 I don't 

604
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,740
so the poor girl that's being exercised by two priests in your home

605
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,350
 and you're telling me you don't believe 

606
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,740
I suggest you both fine

607
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,010
 
God

608
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,970
 real quick 

609
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,150
there are more candles upstairs

610
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,610
 
You're probably going to need them 

611
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,730
the loveliest trick of the devil 

612
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,310
has been to persuade that he does not exist 

613
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,780
the devil needs no more tricks 

614
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,470
is nothing left to hide 

615
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,190

00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,400
making them come 

620
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,750
there will be done 

621
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,000
I don't know if

622
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,160

623
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,290

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,270
 our daily bread 

625
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,880
and forgive us our trespasses 

626
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,960
as we forgive those who trespass against us 

627
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,760
and lead us not into temptation 

628
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,310
and deliver us from evil 

629
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,040

633
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,940
amen 

634
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,720
our father 

635
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,420
I will be their name 

636
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,540

00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,330
give us as the daily bread 

641
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,080
and forgive us so trespasses

642
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,590
 as we forgive those who trespass against us 

643
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,280
lead us not into temptation 

644
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,760

00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,650
 where did they leave off 

651
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,910

654
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,380
what are you going to do with that 

655
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,720
what needs to be done 

656
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,290

 even unto death

he who has built his church on the firm rock and declared that the gates of hell shall never prevail against her

736
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,540
 because he will dwell with her all days even to the end of the world

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:12,960
 command thee 

750
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,810
the blood of the martyrs and the pious intercession of all the saints command

751
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,260
 
Thee 

752
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:21,380
back 

753
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,790
I know you will not listen to me 

754
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,530
but fair 

755
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,240
you must send 

756
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,000
yeah 

757
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,220
I 

758
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:33,350
the body is a temple 

759
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,730
yeah 

760
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:44,850
um 

761
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,920
I 

762
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:56,500
I 

763
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,980
I'm going to be these bad 

764
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,310
yeah 

765
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,430
yet a dog will return to his own lab 

766
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,270
so a fool

767
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,010
 and then with his own volume

768
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:01,910
 for an ambition 

769
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,110
a man of the law 

770
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,180
so 

771
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:15,250
round to that 

772
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:19,390
but yet 

773
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:23,750
and strength 

774
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,840

787
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:45,650
it means when you turn in 

788
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,950
hi

789
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,260

yeah 

798
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,550
what they have to give your child 

799
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,490
and what 

800
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,200
do you last the gods

801
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,890
 
Judge 

802
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,250
but to something holy 

803
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,550
now I baptize you in the blood of the father 

804
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,790
and the 

805
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,780

oh god 

817
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:30,510
how your dog is fighting for eternal soul 

818
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,680
we have three dead priests

819
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,460
 
My nurse 

820
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,470
look at me

821
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:39,050
 
I'm merely 

822
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,080
we can look at me 

823
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,760
okay 

824
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,850
it's not over

825
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,660
 yeah 

826
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,860
daughter needs you 

827
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:49,730
okay 

828
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,100
how to say sorry 

829
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,490
we have about 20 minutes for your staff side

830
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:12,680
 we can get rid of all these bodies

831
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,520
 claims as we can 

832
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,710
we just have to tie up 

833
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,770
we have that

834
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,130
 at least get rid of the bodies 

835
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,590
another is coming 

836
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,200
how do you know that 

837
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,160
you have to understand 

838
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,330
these are the end of days 

839
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,420
demonic possession has begun to run rampant 

840
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,870
people are dying of starvation and disease

841
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:42,470
 and war 

842
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:46,280
I've done my time 

843
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,720
I have a small parish

844
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,540
 it's getting smaller every day 

845
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,710
we're all hungry and thirsty

846
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,780
 and close to death 

847
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,780
this has been foretold

848
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,390
 can't even understand that 

849
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,180
I do

850
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:58,510
 I just

851
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,720
 I wasn't expecting it on my watch 

852
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,960
it's happening on all of our watches 

853
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,360
drought 

854
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,760
flag 

855
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:09,140
starvation 

856
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:10,840
loss of faith 

857
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,890
demonic possession 

858
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,010
I lost 

859
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:18,790
my last exorcism 

860
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,020
I no longer have a soul 

861
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,930
I am forever condemned it to damnation and hell

862
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,530
 
Fire 

863
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,660
I'm still a puppet of the lord

864
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,800
 but I am empty 

865
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,570
nobody else knows that 

866
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,140
do you still believe 

867
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,350
I don't have to believe

868
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,310
 because I know 

869
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,920
I know

870
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,070
 and I lost 

871
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,830
there's a difference between knowing 

872
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,680
in believing 

873
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:53,110
that girl died in her possession 

874
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,580
and because of that

875
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,200
 I can no longer perform the ritual

876
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,000
 because my soul was taken

877
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,690
 
Instead 

878
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:03,570
that exorcism was not okayed by the Vatican

879
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:05,140
 and it was not greenlit 

880
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,830
by me 

881
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,970
you came upon it 

882
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,630
you jumped into it 

883
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,960
you lost 

884
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,200
I understand this 

885
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,600
what are you saying 

886
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:17,980
I'm saying that you weren't ordained to do it 

887
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,020
you had no right to try 

888
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,460
and you did 

889
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,830
I lost the battle

890
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,890
 I forever condemn myself to his position

891
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,840
 now you have a chance to redeem yourself 

892
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,150
and save a soul

893
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,220
 it is very unique and special to us 

894
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,760
I do what I was supposed to do 

895
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,020
yes 

896
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:42,450
you did 

897
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,100
without our knowledge or blessing 

898
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,340
you failed 

899
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,730
is a man 

900
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:52,350
not as a priest of the church

901
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,200
 I am a priest of the church 

902
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,730
you are only a man

903
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,650
 unless we send you

904
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,540
 
Sent me to Bangladesh

905
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,460
 
You were sent there to save souls

906
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,800
 not deliver them the same thing

907
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,610
 
No

908
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:05,760
 it isn't 

909
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,400
specific jobs are for specific beans

910
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,880
 and now I have a specific job for you

911
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,820
 
It doesn't matter 

912
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,470
I lost the battle between good and evil 

913
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,240
you didn't have our ok to do it 

914
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,490
I know the law

915
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,960
 I know the rules

916
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,850
 
An exorcism is one on one

917
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,210
 the loser goes to hell 

918
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,140
the battle 

919
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,190
between heaven and hell 

920
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,400
his rage

921
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,540
 for centuries 

922
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,370
you're not the first priest to have lost 

923
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:43,050
but you're becoming the priest who refuses redemption 

924
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,860
how am I refusing 

925
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,150
sending a soul was priest into an exorcism

926
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,980
 
It's like throwing a strong man into a fire 

927
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,020
you're the only one that can do this 

928
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,370
this is exactly what we need 

929
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,240
wouldn't do it if it were a mile away 

930
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,530
good 

931
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,520
because we're just a block away 

932
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,780
you set me up 

933
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,420
to understand the implications of this 

934
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,540
yes

935
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,520
 we do 

936
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,600
either a new soul walks out of that house 

937
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,740
but we all go to hell 

938
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,580
you're the hill Mary Pass

939
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,120
 pal 

940
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,120
3 priests

941
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,070
 you've gone through those doors before

942
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:28,460
 
You 

943
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,040
and none of them 

944
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,520
if come out 

945
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,130
if you can't say that

946
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:35,640
 girl 

947
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,090
no one can 

948
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,410
the house is down this dirt road on the left

949
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,140
 the dark brown house 

950
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:46,770
inside

951
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,580
 you'll find everything that you need 

952
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,090
and here

953
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,000
 take these 

954
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,170
one is usually enough 

955
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:59,820
I don't see what it'll hurt 

956
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,080
use them like the sands of Jerusalem 

957
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,240
and take this

958
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,210
 you'll need it for the ritual 

959
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,270
god bless you

960
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,210
 my friend 

961
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,940
you're going to need it 

962
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,280
I'll pull yourself together

963
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,800
 the family's going to need you 

964
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,580
I'm father Powell 

965
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,450
Dr johnston 

966
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,250
another priest 

967
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,810
where are the others 

968
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:01,760
I'll add

969
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,710
 we put them in the laundry room

970
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,090
 
We didn't know what else to do 

971
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,050
is their equipments to upstairs

972
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:07,610
 
The work 

973
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,720
crosses

974
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,320
 candles

975
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,010
 yeah

976
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:10,460
 yes

977
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:10,700
 
Yes

978
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,170
 we didn't move that we didn't do anything with that

979
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:12,910
 we were 

980
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:13,640
afraid to 

981
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,210
that was wise 

982
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,060
he should move an extra to call her until the ritual is complete 

983
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,660
or this is the end

984
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,530
 isn't it 

985
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,210
no matter how much darkness 

986
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:27,710
there'd be no darkness without light 

987
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,600
are you both Christian 

988
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,720
have you been baptized

989
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,430
 
Do you believe 

990
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:43,500
no

991
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,070
 father 

992
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,520
and his holy water upstairs 

993
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,480
2 flasks of it 

994
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,350
no matter what you do 

995
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,010
do not go upstairs 

996
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,340
and no matter what you do 

997
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,960
do not come near me unless I say it's ok 

998
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:10,680
yes

999
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,220
 father 

1000
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:18,280
your eternal souls depend upon it 

1001
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:41,330
father 

1002
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,440
why am I 

1003
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,100
father 

1004
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,860
I can come 

1005
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:32,570
I won't be done 

1006
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,440
daybreak 

1007
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,600
responses 

1008
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,210
which of those trespass against us 

1009
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:53,920
just nice 

1010
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,830
kingdom 

1011
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,510
the power 

1012
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,390
in the quarry 

1013
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:33,850
my name 

1014
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,860
before coming 

1015
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,650
and long time 

1016
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,130
and I will 

1017
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,100
you might remember you well 

1018
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,170
I freely 

1019
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,030
gave up something there 

1020
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:55,620
you were never there 

1021
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,780
well

1022
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,370
 similar moving 

1023
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:05,130
it's not often that we make a priest 

1024
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,110
father 

1025
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:08,220
fun 

1026
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,650
jump ahead 

1027
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:13,210
no 

1028
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,480
the same old tricks 

1029
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,460
you realize your world is dying 

1030
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,880
oh 

1031
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:28,980
water is now a precious commodity 

1032
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,470
diseases run rampant

1033
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,820
 birth defects

1034
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,360
 murder

1035
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,660
 rape and Zainal language 

1036
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,760
you're kind 

1037
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:40,500
more 

1038
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:41,460
oh 

1039
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,860
you disgrace your father 

1040
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,110
more than you could ever 

1041
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,760
who are you 

1042
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,510
one of the fallen 

1043
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,510
to think that you could change

1044
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:57,930
 
What I 

1045
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:03,130
your words 

1046
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,260
empty 

1047
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,080
just saw 

1048
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:07,950
really 

1049
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,850
I don't think we should compare 

1050
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:16,780
do we discuss short leash 

1051
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:17,560
no choice 

1052
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,640
I had to do it 

1053
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,570
yeah 

1054
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,870
the power of Christ 

1055
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:28,740
compels you 

1056
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,750
the power does a lot of things can

1057
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,790
 
Compelling is not one of them

1058
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,070
 
I have come a little closer 

1059
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,380
I want you to see the electricity 

1060
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,000

1063
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,920

1064
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,790

1066

1067
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:04,020
everything 

1068
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,130
left

1069
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,610
 you had nothing to make again with father 

1070

1077
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,440
overlord

01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,790
to the forest 

1079
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,460
from the disease 

1080
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:45,710

1081
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,510
