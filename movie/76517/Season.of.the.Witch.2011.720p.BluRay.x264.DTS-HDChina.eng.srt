1
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:09,151
No, no! Please, I beg you!

2
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:11,700
I beg you, tell them the truth!

3
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,670
Tell them you know me, I'm not a witch!

4
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,676
My daughter! No...

5
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,385
Let me go, please!

6
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,200
No! No!

7
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:30,105
No! Please! No!

8
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:35,901
You all have been found guilty of
witchcraft and consulting with the devil.

9
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,533
If you would
save your souls from perdition...

10
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:41,692
...repent now and confess your sins

11
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,943
I confess! I confess! I confess!

12
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:49,414
Go on, Child.
Did You signed a pact with Lucifer?

13
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:52,018
Yes. I signed a pact. I confess!

14
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:54,500
Please, I beg you, have mercy on me!

15
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,520
I made ointments for a couple.

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,822
But it was just pig's fat not witchcraft,
I swear it!

17
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:00,868
Priest...

18
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:04,942
You gonna burn in hell.

19
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,338
Do it.

20
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,834
No! Please!

21
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:20,577
Wait! Wait!
You said that you're would spare me.

22
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:22,721
Your Soul, child.

23
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:25,050
Your Soul will be spared.

24
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,160
But the body must be
consigned to God for absolution.

25
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,596
No! No! Please, I beg you! No...

26
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:58,035
Wait!

27
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:00,961
Thier bodies must be pulled up.

28
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,805
There are words wich must be spoken,
from the book of Solomon.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,003
To unsure they not rise again.

30
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:10,027
They've been hanged and drowned.
That's dead enough for me.

31
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:14,315
Amen.

32
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,181
Today you are truly blessed.

33
00:05:56,281 --> 00:06:00,423
Today, you fight for God himself.

34
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:05,854
Today, yoy're holly warriors,
baptized in the blood of our unholly enemies!

35
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,307
Look to the rabble down there, Behmen.

36
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,516
Just waiting to meet the Lord.

37
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:14,828
I pity anyman whose last face
they see is yours, Felson.

38
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:20,645
The only sin you will face
this day is Faliure.

39
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:23,327
Whom ever slays most men drinks for free.

40
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:26,721
I'll take the 300 left,
you take the 300 on the right.

41
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:30,103
But If we divide them evenlly
who will buy tonigts drinks?

42
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:34,585
- Oh, you're buying tonight man.
- Prepare your battle.

43
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,417
Fine. I'll kill all 600 my self.

44
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:42,469
Draw your arms!

45
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,019
Charge!

46
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,836
I have nothing
but a powerfull thirst baby.

47
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,721
You're buying, my friend.

48
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:02,168
Let the sands burn rage with
the blood of advocates!!

49
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,904
Strik down our unholly enemies!

50
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:52,717
do not yield
every enemy of God has fallen!

51
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:57,133
Do you ever get the felling,
God has many enemies?

52
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,602
being his friend is not so easy either!

53
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:19,387
They are godless people! Infidels!

54
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:24,479
They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

55
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:27,072
They must be punished.

56
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:33,637
Do not fail him!
Strik down with his vengeance!

57
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,641
Let non survive!

58
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:42,200
Thousands lost souls
through the fires of Hell!

59
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,906
- A glorious day for the Church!
- You call this glorious?

60
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:50,212
- Murdering women and children?
- Know your place, knight.

61
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:54,474
- you beldge your life for the cause
- For God. Not for this.

62
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:57,419
I am a herald of God in this world.

63
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,274
- His voice rings ever in my ears.
- Perhaps it's not his voice you hear.

64
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,538
How dare you?
I am the voice of the church!

65
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:07,590
Bathed in truth and blameless
in light of the Lord.

66
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,527
You're no more than
a drop of blood on his hands!

67
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:14,357
Who contorls your insolent tougne,
Behmen?

68
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:26,168
Let's get the hell out of here.

69
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,764
You can not leave!

70
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,254
Who's going stop us?

71
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:12,606
sheep roaming free
and no shepherd in sight.

72
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:16,557
- Did they jumped the fence?
- All of them?

73
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:22,653
We have been walking all day
and have not passed a soul.

74
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:26,083
Keep your souls And only find a chicken.

75
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,591
Hello?

76
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,544
Is anyone here?

77
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:06,850
Hello?

78
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:44,898
What happened to them?

79
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,789
I don't know.

80
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,013
We have seen so much death you and I.

81
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:19,107
Some deserved, some not.

82
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,268
But What is one do,
to deserve a death like that?

83
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:23,862
Nothing.

84
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:39,148
Finally a town!

85
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,623
We might be recognized.

86
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:46,166
- We should go around, Behmen.
- Go where?

87
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,835
The horses won't carry us
They are farm animals.

88
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:54,393
We need proper houses
food...provisions.

89
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:12,284
Please, Let them come to me!

90
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:13,646
I beg you!

91
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,839
please, Take us! No more!

92
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:31,978
<i>Lord all mighty, Heavenly Father. Accept
the pain and suffering we restore upon our selves.</i>

93
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:36,451
<i>Find deed to the awkward to free us!
From this Terbile...</i>

94
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:40,779
- What madness is this?
- Plague.

95
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,140
Plague?

96
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:46,717
Like no other

97
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,506
the pestilence over all the land.

98
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,897
- Is there no cure?
- None.

99
00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:54,098
How long is it been so?

100
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,072
three years in a season.

101
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:01,063
- How many died?
- Some says as many in three and four.

102
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:07,590
But with my own hands I have buried
two children and the wife who born them

103
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,231
But, How is it you you don't know this?

104
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:14,229
We're travellers
We have only recently returned

105
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,193
Here you are

106
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,484
two of my finest

107
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:23,950
Thank you

108
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:33,966
Leave it!

109
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,325
Felson, this way

110
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,718
What is it now?

111
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,762
They saw my sword's Crest

112
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,214
I told we should've gone around

113
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,510
You two! Stand fast!

114
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,994
Shit!

115
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:18,515
Fine

116
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,674
Come with me

117
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,592
Drop it!

118
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:35,721
Remove the hood and the mask

119
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:41,762
Arrest these deserters

120
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,379
Wait!

121
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,015
Let me see that

122
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,263
This is yours?

123
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,599
Follow me

124
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:09,329
I hope we are on our way to dinner

125
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,819
What you want with us, Priest?

126
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:14,720
that's not up for me to say

127
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,430
Pardon me, your eminent

128
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,751
What is it, Debelzaq?

129
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:31,363
This the knight's sword

130
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:33,863
Come closer

131
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:52,449
Tell me your name

132
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:55,009
I am Behmen of Blybrook.

133
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,175
Behmen, yes...

134
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,043
And your comrade, Felson.

135
00:19:01,043 --> 00:19:04,745
Your names are known to me

136
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:08,799
Your victories have become legends

137
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:17,351
Yes, I'm stricken...
The Plague is everywhere

138
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,728
It's a curse called up from Hell

139
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:22,526
Brought upon us by
The Black Witch

140
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:24,830
The Black Witch?!

141
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,404
I myself heard the confession

142
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:33,765
The Witch must be taken
to the abbey of Severak

143
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:39,490
Where the Monks possess the last
copy of an ancient book

144
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,517
rituals that will destroy
the Witch's powers,

145
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:49,344
And End the plague

146
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,618
What is this to do with us?

147
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:57,095
Our ranks have been decimated

148
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,565
You must deliver her

149
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:05,118
My best knight, Eckhart
has already pledged his services

150
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,880
As has our priest Debelzaq

151
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,678
I ask the same of you

152
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:16,302
Will you serve the church, once more?

153
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,874
- I can not
- You swear in front of God

154
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:23,140
- Have you been released from this vow?
- My vow is to god

155
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,275
Not the men who murder in his name.

156
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,651
You know the penalty for desertion

157
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:33,196
I ask again
Behmen of Blybrook,

158
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:39,135
Do you serve God and the church?

159
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:41,870
I serve the church no more

160
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:47,951
In there

161
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:50,986
Both of you

162
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:02,951
What do they do with deserters any way?

163
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,171
Hang them?

164
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:08,015
Burn them?

165
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:10,312
Probably both

166
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,421
I know

167
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:17,145
If I the one who say on the matter
I prefer hanging

168
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,508
Is that the Witch?!

169
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,184
That is not what I see

170
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,626
The priest said she confessed.

171
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:57,202
We both know the church
can be Most... Persuasive

172
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:58,931
Ahh

173
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,675
I am Sorry, I put you into this Felson

174
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:07,463
Ah, These dungeons go
and this one is not so bad

175
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:10,561
We spent nights in much worse places than this

176
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:12,457
At least I have

177
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,184
What's that smell?

178
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,093
That would be you

179
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:38,941
"I serve the church no more"

180
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:44,501
Did you see the priest's face?

181
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:48,749
He looked like someone pissed in his holy water

182
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:11,530
They are godless people! Infidels

183
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:16,257
They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

184
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:18,854
They must be punished

185
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,208
You want to speak with the Cardinal?

186
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,054
Tell him we will deliver
the girl to Severak, on one condition

187
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:02,162
That she is given a fair trail

188
00:24:02,802 --> 00:24:06,817
- You cann't bargain with the church.
- This is not for your church.

189
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:10,890
And we want our weapons returned

190
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:15,601
And all charges dismissed

191
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,520
We're here.
The abbey is is here

192
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,710
The distance is nearly 400 leagues
That's roughly Six days travel

193
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,568
As you can see,
We charted a course.

194
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,770
You would lead us through here?

195
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:33,054
That is the most direct route, yes.

196
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,834
Across the river, through...

197
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:39,168
300 Leagues of heavy forest,
and a mountain pass?

198
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:41,595
This forest is called Wormwood

199
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,700
It's not a place to be trifled with.

200
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:46,478
Men have lost their way there,
and were never to be seen again.

201
00:24:46,783 --> 00:24:49,852
Tell me, Priest,
have you ever made a journey yourself?

202
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:53,100
- No.
- Naturally.

203
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:57,132
these are the best maps in the land.

204
00:24:57,532 --> 00:24:59,358
But, We will do better to have a guide.

205
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:03,553
You know, someone who has travelled
from here to there.

206
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:06,592
A tax collector, perhaps a merchant?

207
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:12,348
There is someone, but...

208
00:25:15,428 --> 00:25:17,261
Ahhh,...Visitors!

209
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,694
What can I do for you gentlemen?

210
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,690
Perhaps, you would like to help me with fruit,
or kick me in the groin

211
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,360
You're Hagamar? The swindler?

212
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,207
Yes.

213
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:26,697
I... I mean no!

214
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:29,289
I am Hagamar,
but I never swindled anyone.

215
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:32,498
I sold relics. Genuine Relics

216
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,541
Where did sell your trinkets?

217
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:38,026
Everywhere.
I have happy customers from here to Prague.

218
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,568
And in Severak?

219
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:44,056
Yes. The monks.

220
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:47,448
I sold them the tail of an asteroid
and a flag from Egypt

221
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:52,386
- Quite a bargain,I am sure
- Then you know the way to the abbey.

222
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,135
Like the back of my hand.

223
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:56,933
I'd happy to draw you a map, only...

224
00:25:57,328 --> 00:26:00,074
The bailiff has prepared to pardon you

225
00:26:00,174 --> 00:26:02,577
On one condition.

226
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:05,201
You serve as our guide to Severak.

227
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:07,065
Condition accepted.

228
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:11,441
If I were to release you however,
and you attempt to flee...

229
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,262
Such thoughts are beneath you sir

230
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:16,797
I swear by all the saints,
they struck me dead, were I to lie.

231
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:20,437
and you will have to get in line behind me.

232
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,712
Do we understand each other?

233
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:34,593
the Witch is unconscious.
she was given a powerful sedative in her food last night

234
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,364
Open the cell.

235
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,195
We will be removing the witch for transport.

236
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,633
She's just a girl.

237
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,062
Don't be deceived.

238
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:12,355
Felson!

239
00:27:13,374 --> 00:27:16,397
Hold her! Hold her!

240
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:19,684
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.

241
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:25,543
Now she is sedated

242
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,493
Who is that?

243
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:46,911
- The Witch.
- Witch?

244
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,194
Nobody said anything about a witch.

245
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,463
What did you think we are going to Severak,
to sell trinkets?

246
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,200
Kill the witch!

247
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,863
You gave us this infection!

248
00:27:57,088 --> 00:28:00,856
you brought the wrath of good upon us!
Take the witch out of our land

249
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:03,516
And take the plague with you!

250
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,083
Demon!

251
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:52,321
She is watching me

252
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:56,059
Put your mind on something else.
She is trying to frighten you.

253
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,187
It's working.

254
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,970
How did you come upon this girl?

255
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,532
She was found
just outside of Maburn, wandering...

256
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:09,694
Muttering strange things words,
no one can understand

257
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:13,837
- This makes her a witch?
- No, but it's a sign.

258
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:17,672
And with in the fourth night of her arrival,
Plague has swept over us.

259
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:20,892
It was the same for every town she passed

260
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:25,331
There no talk of such a girl
passing through my village...

261
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,486
Yet, the plague came

262
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:43,747
She is stronger than she looks.

263
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:48,302
Do you believe she is a witch?

264
00:29:48,402 --> 00:29:51,796
But you felt her strength
would you say, it was that of a girl?

265
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:55,492
I have seen girls destroy men
without lifting a finger.

266
00:29:55,592 --> 00:30:00,241
How many times do we need to go over this?
We were in France! For god's sake.

267
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:04,035
And things she did in the bed chamber.

268
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:08,024
- She robbed you out of the years' wages.
- Yes, but...

269
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,286
she gave me so much in return.

270
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:15,499
Look at us.

271
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:18,286
Barely a month out of service to the church
and here we are!

272
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:21,826
deserters, in the service of the church.

273
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:27,390
You know we are being followed.

274
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:34,147
Let's give him a royal welcome

275
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:55,301
Come off the horse.

276
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:06,444
Who are you? Why are you following us?

277
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,171
I asked you a question boy.

278
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,969
He's an altar boy
and services to the Cardinal.

279
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:15,766
My name is Kay.

280
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:19,158
My father was a knight. Yuran Wolenbar.

281
00:31:19,258 --> 00:31:22,671
He also fought in "Ambrose"
Perhaps you have heard his name.

282
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:28,342
- What do you want?
- I want to come with you to Severak.

283
00:31:28,442 --> 00:31:30,269
Easy, boy.

284
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,336
To pledge myself to your service

285
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:39,854
In exchange, for which I ask your word
that you will vouch for me upon our return...

286
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:42,419
So I may be knighted.

287
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:51,752
The services of an altar boy
I feel safer already

288
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:55,634
I would have you know, I have been written 
in the lists twice and I won flags for valour.

289
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:58,411
That's not a tournament, boy.
Go back to your mother.

290
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:01,035
This is a free road, old man

291
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:03,221
And I don't need your permission
to travel it.

292
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,290
Give the lad a chance
to retract the remark.

293
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:12,988
My sincere apologies.

294
00:32:14,356 --> 00:32:18,896
- Not to me, to him
- That I can not. He insulted me first.

295
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,612
I'm going to teach this one some manners.

296
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:27,070
Go easy, Felson. Use the other hand.

297
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,948
I don't want him dead.
Just send him on his way.

298
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:32,806
Be quick about it.

299
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,968
With pleasure

300
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:53,623
Not bad for an altar boy.

301
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:11,882
What the devil was that?

302
00:33:12,197 --> 00:33:14,879
Stand and fight like a man,
you little jackrabbit.

303
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:30,107
Enough!

304
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:34,859
Perhaps you can be of service.

305
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:52,664
I heard what the cardinal said,
about your heroism in the Crusades.

306
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,776
I'd have gone too, but I was too young.

307
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:59,187
You're one of the lucky ones!

308
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,421
Well, tell me about it,
where did you enlist?

309
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:08,037
It was a priest
how came to Felson's village.

310
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:11,559
He told us: "whoever went on Crusade, 
would receive blessings

311
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,577
from the church".. "Remission from sin".

312
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:18,152
It was the part about sin that
perk young Felson is interest.

313
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:19,552
That's not true.

314
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:23,714
So he asks the priest:
"what sins would be forgiven"...

315
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:25,684
"Would they forgive adultery?"

316
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:31,898
The priest says:
"Yes, for two year bledge".

317
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:34,573
"What about theft?"

318
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:38,896
"Yes, for a three year bledge."

319
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:43,324
So Felson mulls it over
and says to the priest.

320
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:45,985
"Better sign me up for ten."

321
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:03,176
I brought you some food...

322
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:06,758
and warmth.

323
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,177
You're not like the others.

324
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:18,379
You're kind.

325
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:36,000
Was it Debelzaq, who hurt you?

326
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,809
This place you taking me...

327
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,704
What will happen to me there?

328
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:50,401
Your innocence or
guilt will be decided

329
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:55,205
There was a girl in my village
who was suspected of being a witch.

330
00:35:57,172 --> 00:36:02,572
They put stones in her pockets
and cast her into the lake.

331
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:07,033
If she drown,
they would have known she was human.

332
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:12,220
But she didn't. She lived.

333
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:16,805
They called it proof of magic,
and burned at the stake.

334
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,268
Nothing of the kind will happen to you.

335
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:22,745
You will be given a fair trial.

336
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:25,944
You have my word on that

337
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:36,337
Did she said anything?

338
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:41,938
- Why do you ask?
- I only mean to caution you!

339
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,771
The witch is a deceiver.
She will turn one man against another.

340
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,843
Who is to guard the wagon?

341
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,822
Guard the wagon? That girl is kid.

342
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:59,543
- And I'm tired.
- I'll go.

343
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:03,380
Perhaps someone else
should take the first watch.

344
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,522
I'll go.

345
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:10,224
Don't worry that. There will be
plenty of time between here and severak.

346
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,932
Eckhart, be watch.

347
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:35,886
I came to relieve you.

348
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:41,167
You're not tired?

349
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:43,969
No. No.

350
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,629
I don't sleep much these days.

351
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:53,495
I was thinking how much
the girl reminds me of my daughter.

352
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,303
I'm sorry for your loss.

353
00:37:57,006 --> 00:38:02,630
- What was her name?
- Mila. Her name was Mila.

354
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,095
Tell me, Father...

355
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:12,809
You say the Cardinal has given his word
that she will have a fair trial.

356
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,618
But has he not also
given his word end to the plague?

357
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,395
What do you suggesting?

358
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:23,569
Can you imagine the reaction of the people
if she weren't to be found guilty of witchcraft

359
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:25,494
No Father...

360
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:30,811
You know as well as I the church 
can't afford that...not now.

361
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:31,827
No.

362
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:35,839
No, our responsibility is
to deliver her for trail.

363
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,330
The monks will decide her fate.

364
00:38:40,003 --> 00:38:41,410
Exactly.

365
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:46,000
The monks will decide her fate.
and I will not be a part of this.

366
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,719
No will the others, hopefully
when they have heard what I have to say

367
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:51,281
Wait!

368
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,044
Please don't go.

369
00:38:53,404 --> 00:38:56,050
Please, don't leave me alone with him.

370
00:38:56,258 --> 00:38:57,408
Are you afraid?

371
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:03,152
- Listen to me.
- Eckhart.

372
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:04,281
I'm not leave...

373
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:09,739
Give me that key!

374
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,130
How did she escape?

375
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,287
She took the key from around my neck.

376
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,446
Which way did she go?

377
00:39:36,224 --> 00:39:39,002
Maybe she followed this road to the village.

378
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,082
Kay and Eckhart that way

379
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:01,308
She's in the square!

380
00:42:29,704 --> 00:42:33,897
this is a grave... this is a mass grave.

381
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:38,606
Father

382
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:41,247
Wait here.

383
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,063
Father

384
00:42:52,063 --> 00:42:53,453
Mila?

385
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:55,239
Father

386
00:42:56,645 --> 00:42:58,053
I'm here.

387
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,515
Eckhart!

388
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:10,704
- Mila?
- Father

389
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:13,568
- Mila...
- Father, where are you?

390
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:17,866
- Mila! My child.
- Father? is that you

391
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,196
- Don't run away!
- Father.

392
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:22,909
Mila?

393
00:43:25,662 --> 00:43:29,439
- Baba.
- Ohhhh, Mila?

394
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:36,445
Eckhart!

395
00:43:37,189 --> 00:43:39,568
Felson! Behmen!

396
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:41,391
Where you are?

397
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,935
He came running out of nowhere

398
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,379
Why didn't he stop?
Why didn't he see me?

399
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:52,398
Dear God? What have I done?

400
00:43:54,258 --> 00:43:56,917
He looked me in the eye, but he didn't see me.

401
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,457
He called me Mila.

402
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:13,480
Behmen.

403
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:29,319
I had to run, I had no choice.

404
00:44:29,354 --> 00:44:31,726
I couldn't let him touch me again.

405
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:32,776
I'm so sorry.

406
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:35,351
Please, please, don't take me back there.

407
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,060
Please, I beg you, please...

408
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:51,631
Heavenly Father, we pray thee.

409
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:55,007
Take thy servant Johan Eckhart,
down to the Heavenly realm

410
00:44:55,665 --> 00:44:58,507
For he was a soldier of the cross
and fought in thy name

411
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,445
And in the name of Thy only Son,
Jesus Christ.

412
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:06,274
And Thus did he die
for the glory of God.

413
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,245
Amen.

414
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:11,784
Amen.

415
00:45:17,658 --> 00:45:19,472
Would anyone care to offer some words?

416
00:45:21,598 --> 00:45:24,737
Let his sacrifice, not be in vain.

417
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:33,019
Behmen!

418
00:45:34,243 --> 00:45:35,848
Behmen, I must speak with you

419
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:42,471
- What is it now, Priest?
- You must warn the others
be careful in her presence. Not to...

420
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,982
not to discuss personal matters,
things she might use against...Listen to me!

421
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:49,971
It was the witch killed Eckhart.

422
00:45:50,006 --> 00:45:52,943
You...you heard what Kay said.
his mind wasn't his own.

423
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:55,391
She overheard us talking of his daughter.

424
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:58,340
What exactly are you suggesting?

425
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,449
She sees the weakness that lies in our hearts

426
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:04,872
And once she sees that,
she will use against us.

427
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:53,805
Crusader!

428
00:46:55,892 --> 00:46:57,665
I am truly grateful
for your help.

429
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:00,304
You're very brave.

430
00:47:02,045 --> 00:47:05,338
A man like you could never stand
to see young girl come to any harm

431
00:47:06,234 --> 00:47:08,636
Debelzaq believes,
you are the blame for Eckhart's death.

432
00:47:10,149 --> 00:47:14,306
And you believe him?
After what he did to me?

433
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,900
I had no reason to harm Eckhart
He was nothing but kind to me.

434
00:47:19,508 --> 00:47:21,212
He told me, I look like his daughter.

435
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:26,948
I can see his death weighs heavy on your mind

436
00:47:30,526 --> 00:47:32,904
Allow me to ease your pain.

437
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:43,093
Some good deeds can done
even from behind bars.

438
00:47:54,603 --> 00:47:57,984
Kay, remember this, it was not your fault.

439
00:47:58,784 --> 00:48:01,544
It was the witch.
No one else.

440
00:48:01,624 --> 00:48:03,384
He died by my sword.

441
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:05,959
- It could just as easily have been another's
- But it wasn't.

442
00:48:06,614 --> 00:48:09,783
It was mine. I killed him.

443
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:28,625
Why are we stopped?

444
00:48:30,135 --> 00:48:32,238
You call that a bridge?

445
00:48:32,273 --> 00:48:34,495
Last time I saw it
was eight or nine years ago.

446
00:48:35,193 --> 00:48:37,010
I remember it differently.

447
00:48:37,193 --> 00:48:39,623
Is that our reward for taking 
a swindler as our guide.

448
00:48:39,693 --> 00:48:42,024
I told you,
I am not a swindler

449
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:44,356
You're not much of a guide either,
are you?!

450
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,667
How we are supposed to get 
across this rotting temper

451
00:48:48,702 --> 00:48:50,585
You are blaming me for the bridge?

452
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,435
You're the one who led us to it.

453
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:53,573
You're the one...

454
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:55,585
Behmen!

455
00:48:56,737 --> 00:48:58,281
Behmen!

456
00:49:47,022 --> 00:49:51,064
Take everything of the wagon
bring the horses across. One by one.

457
00:50:04,123 --> 00:50:06,032
It will be on my count of three.

458
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:20,033
One, two, three!

459
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:46,310
My hands!

460
00:50:49,584 --> 00:50:50,602
ahhhhh...!

461
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:53,531
Cann't hold out much longer!

462
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:12,911
Help!

463
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:33,455
Hagamar, hitch a rope to the horses,
that we will use them to pull the wagon.

464
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,521
If you let me out,
it'll be lighter.

465
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,386
Please, I can help.

466
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:28,957
- It won't hold.
- It will

467
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:30,301
Push.

468
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:39,468
Push!

469
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:46,465
You won't make it. Let me out.

470
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:55,667
- Come on!
- Push!

471
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:16,100
That was a little too close!

472
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:20,573
I've saved your ass a hundred times.
Have a little faith!

473
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,825
Kay, bring me a fresh wrap Priest hand.

474
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:30,278
It would be a shame
if you bleed to death

475
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:39,214
Thank you

476
00:53:57,322 --> 00:53:58,719
Felson

477
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,511
The flask!

478
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:09,403
Really?

479
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:23,210
What is this place?

480
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:28,751
Hagamar, where are we?

481
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:32,421
The Wormwood forest.

482
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,158
Damn fog. Like a veil before my eyes.

483
00:55:02,396 --> 00:55:03,904
We haven't strayed from the path,
have we?

484
00:55:03,939 --> 00:55:06,125
I can barely see my own hand
in front of my face.

485
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:09,501
The only reason you're around
is because you claimed you knew the way.

486
00:55:09,975 --> 00:55:11,606
I know the way,
it's just I can't see the way.

487
00:55:13,192 --> 00:55:15,794
Maybe you would like to
try leading the way! Huh!

488
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,370
Enough!

489
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:19,703
Both of you.

490
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,611
We kept her on the road.
Wait for the fog to pass.

491
00:55:49,573 --> 00:55:51,368
Kay told me
what happened on the bridge.

492
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,274
He says, you saved his life.

493
00:55:55,588 --> 00:55:58,785
With one hand... Hard to believe.

494
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:03,156
We believe what we want to believe.

495
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,792
Do you believe I am a witch, Behmen?

496
00:56:12,071 --> 00:56:15,424
You are not afraid of me, are you?

497
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:51,359
Trouble sleeping?

498
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:54,333
Myself as well

499
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:01,239
I'm not sure if it's the fog, the altitude...

500
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:05,760
It's unsettling, even for a knight.

501
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:09,521
Let alone spineless scavenger like myself!

502
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:11,709
That's not what I meant.

503
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:19,255
No! Behmen, how many more are
going to die before we reach a Severak?

504
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:23,360
- None, if I can help it.
- And if you can't, what then what?

505
00:57:24,445 --> 00:57:27,373
Forgive me if I seem reluctant
to put my life in your hands

506
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,604
But I have a better solution.
We kill the bitch!

507
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:32,111
Here and now, be done with it

508
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:34,272
We tell whose back in "Mol bow",
she tried to escape.

509
00:57:34,634 --> 00:57:37,271
She meant us harm...
What can we do? we had no choice.

510
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:41,583
And who will be the wiser?

511
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,436
I, for one.

512
00:57:56,637 --> 00:57:57,836
Did you hear that?

513
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,002
- What it's it? What is happening?
- Listen.

514
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,439
Quite.

515
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:20,187
Wolfs

516
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:27,249
What do we do?

517
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,538
Kill as many as you can.

518
00:59:42,365 --> 00:59:46,468
- Oh no.
- Get the horses, I'll take the wagon.

519
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:53,721
Behmen!

520
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:00,043
It's too late. We cann't help him.

521
01:01:52,249 --> 01:01:54,398
Behmen! What are you doing?

522
01:01:56,306 --> 01:01:57,169
Behmen, what are you doing?

523
01:01:57,541 --> 01:02:01,578
- He's doing what comes naturally killing the innocent.
- You can not do this

524
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,942
Step aside,two lifes 
have already been lost.

525
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:06,019
No one grieves for that more than I.

526
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:08,118
Step aside! or this arrow will be yours!

527
01:02:08,508 --> 01:02:10,690
If we fault her now,
those lives will have been lost in vain

528
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,976
Or will not be lost!!
Four lifes will be spared.

529
01:02:14,011 --> 01:02:16,597
And what are four lives, compared
with the thousands more will be lost

530
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:17,894
if this plague is not ended.

531
01:02:17,953 --> 01:02:20,328
I know, there may be no room
in your heart for God, Behmen.

532
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,990
But in my heart
I know he would not abandon us.

533
01:02:23,223 --> 01:02:24,633
In God's name...

534
01:02:25,382 --> 01:02:31,006
No man has spilt more blood
in God's name than I

535
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:35,313
Benevolent God,
what are odds thus takes a man

536
01:02:36,821 --> 01:02:39,748
If you kill her,
you will not have God to blame

537
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:42,447
Only yourself.

538
01:02:55,008 --> 01:02:57,586
He ends the say

539
01:02:58,617 --> 01:03:02,044
Look. Severak...

540
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,277
We've come a long way, Behmen.

541
01:03:23,882 --> 01:03:28,227
Crossed oceans, deserts...
Seen things a few men have seen

542
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:35,541
When this is over,
I think I like see the valley where I was born.

543
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:38,041
And you?

544
01:03:38,387 --> 01:03:40,338
I have no such yearnings for home.

545
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:42,105
Ohh...Then come with me.

546
01:03:42,355 --> 01:03:48,622
I will show you my home and sit in the hall
where my forefathers sat and a drink ale.

547
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:52,406
And tell tales, few men have lived to tell

548
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:54,901
A fewer still will believe!

549
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,106
Either we'll know the truth,
my friend. We'll know,...

550
01:04:16,893 --> 01:04:18,903
Hello!

551
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:24,254
Is anyone there?

552
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,470
- Where are the monks?
- The chapel.

553
01:05:14,552 --> 01:05:16,065
At this time, they should be in vespers.

554
01:05:26,972 --> 01:05:29,455
My brothers, forgive the intrusion,
But we have travelled far.

555
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:57,060
It cann't be!

556
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:01,473
He would not abandon us.

557
01:06:03,853 --> 01:06:05,560
God would not abandon us.

558
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:22,179
We must go,
There is no hope here. Only the plague...

559
01:06:22,955 --> 01:06:23,934
Go where?

560
01:06:26,136 --> 01:06:28,419
These men were our hope

561
01:06:29,793 --> 01:06:33,841
We are in God's hands now
Prayer is our only salvation.

562
01:06:35,246 --> 01:06:38,468
- Our Lord in heaven, Hallowed be thy name...
- Debelzaq!

563
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,652
- Thy kingdom come, They will be done...
- Debelzaq!

564
01:06:41,687 --> 01:06:42,574
...as it is in heaven

565
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:45,323
Give us this day, our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

566
01:06:45,576 --> 01:06:46,318
Get up!

567
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:47,422
We forgive those how trespass against us

568
01:06:47,457 --> 01:06:48,122
Get up!

569
01:06:48,227 --> 01:06:49,836
And lead us nary to temptation

570
01:06:50,001 --> 01:06:52,545
But deliver us from evil..

571
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:27,800
Debelzaq...

572
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,229
The Key of Solomon book 
of which the cardinal spoke.

573
01:07:43,604 --> 01:07:46,985
Within this pages is saved to be
all the rituals, prayers, and incantations

574
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,657
Used by holy men,
throughout the ages

575
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:51,380
To defend against the forces of evil

576
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,365
Can...

577
01:07:55,245 --> 01:07:57,357
... you perform the ritual?

578
01:08:08,204 --> 01:08:09,865
What have we here?

579
01:08:10,226 --> 01:08:13,188
Is this the fair trial
you promised me, Behmen?

580
01:08:13,535 --> 01:08:16,164
You see with your own fate.

581
01:08:21,636 --> 01:08:24,535
Let it be known to all here present
And before God, himself

582
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,756
That this woman
stands accused of witchcraft,

583
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:30,886
That she is admitted to call up the plague
against all mankind.

584
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,783
I'm flattered.

585
01:08:33,185 --> 01:08:34,828
But I must confess...

586
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:38,676
I have deceived you...

587
01:08:38,711 --> 01:08:41,097
You think you can save yourself by recanting
But you're wrong

588
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:42,940
Speak the truth now before God!

589
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:44,060
The Truth?

590
01:08:45,052 --> 01:08:47,360
Do not talk to me of the truth,
you hypocrite

591
01:08:48,752 --> 01:08:53,220
For centuries you and your ilk
have been burning, hanging, crucifying

592
01:08:53,318 --> 01:08:55,396
Anyone who stood in their way.

593
01:08:59,203 --> 01:09:01,008
In truth, I shall thank you.

594
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:03,758
The church has sent more souls
to Perdition

595
01:09:03,976 --> 01:09:07,819
than all of the wars, famines
and pestilences is put together.

596
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:09,854
That's a lie, Witch!

597
01:09:09,889 --> 01:09:11,592
Debelzaq, the ritual!

598
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,462
And you, Behmen?
All you needed was a child to save.

599
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:35,807
Someone to ease your pitiful guilt

600
01:09:36,456 --> 01:09:39,865
Do you truly think that saving
one racked wave, would change anything?

601
01:09:41,323 --> 01:09:44,677
Come Behmen. Your sins are legend.

602
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,355
How many innocent
have fallen beneath that very blade?

603
01:09:50,538 --> 01:09:53,734
They are godless people, Infidels

604
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:57,931
They sinned against God and
against his only son, Jesus Christ!

605
01:09:57,966 --> 01:09:59,600
They must be punished

606
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:02,574
How could you know?

607
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:08,434
This no witch!

608
01:10:09,356 --> 01:10:10,984
This no witch!

609
01:10:20,957 --> 01:10:22,445
Do not utter those words!

610
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:46,454
We're goanna need more
Holly water.

611
01:11:54,086 --> 01:11:55,309
Here!

612
01:11:58,962 --> 01:12:00,189
Tell me, Behmen...

613
01:12:02,004 --> 01:12:06,662
Are we going in there to defeat
the demon or to save the girl?

614
01:12:08,804 --> 01:12:09,878
Both.

615
01:12:17,722 --> 01:12:19,314
I have found more holly water.

616
01:12:20,004 --> 01:12:21,442
You've done well.

617
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,037
- This as far as you go, Kay.
- I don't understand...

618
01:12:27,662 --> 01:12:29,184
This's not your battle.

619
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:32,606
I took a vow to join your cause.

620
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:36,476
I release you from your vow
There's no shame in it.

621
01:12:37,304 --> 01:12:41,265
Honour is not as thing
to be dismissed or forgotten.

622
01:12:42,777 --> 01:12:46,084
A vow must be fulfilled,
else, there is no vow at all.

623
01:12:46,578 --> 01:12:49,644
- Even are the cost of your life?
- Even then.

624
01:12:59,984 --> 01:13:01,560
Kneel, Kay.

625
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:05,964
Speak after me.

626
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:10,035
- Grant me courage Lord...
- Grant me courage Lord...

627
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:14,387
- For I'm thy servant.
- For I'm thy servant.

628
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:19,927
- And guard me with strength into battle...
- And guard me with strength into battle...

629
01:13:20,176 --> 01:13:23,021
- That I may crush thy enemies...
- That I may crush thy enemies...

630
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:28,332
- As dust before the wind.
- As dust before the wind.

631
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:32,070
- Amen.
- Amen.

632
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,572
Amen.

633
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:38,992
Rise a knight.

634
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:52,866
- Felson.
- What is it?

635
01:13:53,992 --> 01:13:56,354
I know in my heart,
I haven't earned this.

636
01:14:00,914 --> 01:14:02,975
You will...

637
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:16,294
The demon could've escaped anytime.

638
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,673
Why did it wait until we reach Severak?

639
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,694
Perhaps escape wasn't it's purpose.

640
01:14:22,063 --> 01:14:23,730
It wants to be here.

641
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:27,341
Debelzaq, You said
Eckhart tried to free her.

642
01:14:27,867 --> 01:14:29,444
and I will not be a part of this.

643
01:14:29,648 --> 01:14:30,727
- Father!
- Mila?

644
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,423
and it killed him, and Hagamar too.
He stood in it's way.

645
01:14:37,485 --> 01:14:39,897
We kill the bitch!
Here and now, be done with it

646
01:14:43,989 --> 01:14:46,629
It wanted to come here
from the very beginning.

647
01:14:47,032 --> 01:14:48,262
My God!

648
01:14:48,953 --> 01:14:50,621
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.

649
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:53,478
He's right. Everything it's done,
has led us here.

650
01:15:15,575 --> 01:15:17,089
Over Here.

651
01:15:30,237 --> 01:15:32,643
Why would a dying monk
do this to himself?

652
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,522
Why would he tie himself to a desk?

653
01:15:36,674 --> 01:15:38,378
It's a passage from Book of Solomon.

654
01:15:51,675 --> 01:15:53,039
Have more over here

655
01:15:58,799 --> 01:16:00,112
And more.

656
01:16:11,543 --> 01:16:12,658
They were copying it.

657
01:16:13,786 --> 01:16:16,454
To spread the wisdom of Solomon
to all the corners of the earth

658
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,453
..... the bias might beyond

659
01:16:21,857 --> 01:16:22,981
It wants the book!

660
01:16:25,106 --> 01:16:28,159
That why the demon deceived us
into believe in the girl was witch.

661
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:33,122
It knew that a witch will be brought to those
who possess the Book of Solomon.

662
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:36,857
You've seen what this plague has done...

663
01:16:38,106 --> 01:16:40,670
If the book would've fall
into the demon's hands,

664
01:16:40,953 --> 01:16:44,234
We would face an endless darkness.

665
01:16:45,232 --> 01:16:47,285
It's our last defence.

666
01:16:47,532 --> 01:16:49,732
I should thank all of you.

667
01:16:56,048 --> 01:17:00,049
You sacrificed so much
to deliver me here

668
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,749
And now you've brought me the book.

669
01:17:08,129 --> 01:17:09,568
Debelzaq...

670
01:17:15,562 --> 01:17:16,797
Silence!

671
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:20,141
- Watch out!
- Behmen!

672
01:17:39,703 --> 01:17:40,704
Where are they?

673
01:17:41,607 --> 01:17:44,454
- Who?
- The Monks?

674
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,958
You can weaken it!
you have to keep reading.

675
01:18:41,293 --> 01:18:43,405
The head...
Cut off their heads!

676
01:19:08,234 --> 01:19:09,910
They're like cockroaches.

677
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,850
Felson

678
01:21:01,255 --> 01:21:05,193
You have no idea how bad cause of book
Cause to me till over the centuries

679
01:21:07,157 --> 01:21:10,266
I destroyed the others.
This is the last one.

680
01:21:20,177 --> 01:21:22,361
you'll be buying tonight my friend.

681
01:21:56,728 --> 01:21:58,333
Felson!

682
01:22:19,294 --> 01:22:21,302
Finish it!

683
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:49,683
Behmen...

684
01:24:01,212 --> 01:24:02,874
What can I do?

685
01:24:06,401 --> 01:24:08,113
Keep her safe.

686
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:55,424
God be with you, Felson.

687
01:25:05,658 --> 01:25:06,968
It's strange...

688
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:12,482
To owe so much to someone 
I've never even knew.

689
01:25:14,671 --> 01:25:16,406
I don't know what to say.

690
01:25:18,978 --> 01:25:21,127
Say what is within your heart.

691
01:25:25,804 --> 01:25:27,765
My name is Anna.

692
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,608
I owe you my life.

693
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:35,351
God keep you.

694
01:25:56,183 --> 01:25:58,501
Will you tell me about them?

695
01:25:59,443 --> 01:26:01,260
I want to know them.

696
01:26:17,576 --> 01:26:21,072
So the plague past
and life returned to the land

697
01:26:22,705 --> 01:26:26,902
There are many who say the plague was nothing
but a pestilence that finally broke,

698
01:26:27,528 --> 01:26:29,817
Like the passing of a fever.

699
01:26:30,631 --> 01:26:33,881
They don't know the darkness
that almost was.

700
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:36,802
The sacrifices have made...

701
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:39,104
The heroes lost...

702
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:42,434
I'll tell their story.

703
01:26:43,008 --> 01:26:46,500
I was there. I know.
