1
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,847
No, please! I beg you!

2
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,475
I beg you! Tell them the truth!

3
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:40,898
Tell them you know me!
I'm not a witch.

4
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,975
My daughter!
No! No!

5
00:00:49,774 --> 00:00:52,072
No! No!

6
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:55,408
No! Please!

7
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,661
No!

8
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,993
You have all been found
guilty of witchcraft

9
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,828
and consorting with the devil.

10
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:05,131
If you would save your souls
from perdition,

11
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:07,675
repent now and confess your sins.

12
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,718
I confess. I confess.

13
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:11,592
I confess!

14
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,175
Go on, child. Did you
sign a pact with Lucifer?

15
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:17,807
Yes, I signed a pact. I confess.

16
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:19,478
Please, I beg you!

17
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:22,182
- Have mercy on me!
- I made ointments for a copper!

18
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:24,734
But it was just pig's fat,
not witchcraft, I swear it!

19
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:26,436
WOMAN: Priest.

20
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,153
You're gonna burn in hell.

21
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:34,034
Do it.

22
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,530
No! No!

23
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:39,991
WOMAN: Please! No! No!

24
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:41,451
MAN: That's a witch!

25
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,624
Oh, wait! Wait!
You said you would spare me!

26
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:50,756
Your soul, child.
Your soul will be spared.

27
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:54,305
But the body must be consigned
to God for absolution.

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,633
No, no, please! I beg you!

29
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,842
No!

30
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,752
Wait!

31
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:26,670
The bodies.
They must be pulled up.

32
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,250
There are words which must be
spoken from the Book of Solomon

33
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,176
to ensure they do not rise again.

34
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:36,176
They've been hung and drowned.
That's dead enough for me.

35
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,911
Amen.

36
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:22,638
MAN: Today you are truly blessed.

37
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:26,684
Today you tight for God himself.

38
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,107
Today you are holy warriors, baptized
in the blood of our unholy enemies.

39
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:34,183
Look at that rabble down there, Behmen.

40
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:36,143
Just waiting to meet the Lord.

41
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:39,822
I pity any man whose last face
they see is yours, Felson.

42
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:42,195
MAN CONTINUES: ...has fallen!

43
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:46,700
The only sin you will face
this day is failure!

44
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,202
Whomever slays the most men
drinks for free.

45
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,376
I'll take the 300 on the left,
you take the 300 on the right.

46
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:56,547
But if we divide them evenly,
who will buy tonight's drinks?

47
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,044
Oh, you're buying, my friend.

48
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,048
Prepare for battle!

49
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,221
Fine, I'll kill all 600 myself.

50
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:06,890
Draw your arms!

51
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:15,941
Charge!

52
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:06,943
I'm building up
a powerful thirst, Behmen!

53
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,279
You're buying, my friend.

54
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:28,347
MAN: Let the sands turn red
with the blood of heretics!

55
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:34,057
Strike down our unholy enemies!

56
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:18,394
Do not yield until
every enemy of God has fallen!

57
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,103
You ever get the feeling
God has too many enemies?

58
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,113
Being his friend is not so easy either.

59
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:46,133
They are godless people. Infidels!

60
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,884
They have sinned against God
and against His only son, Jesus Christ.

61
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,385
They must be punished!

62
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:59,097
Do not fail Him!
Strike down with His vengeance!

63
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,436
Let none survive!

64
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,208
A thousand lost souls
for the fires of hell.

65
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,088
A glorious day for the Church.

66
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,421
You call this glorious?
Murdering women and children?

67
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:18,226
Know your place, knight.
You pledged your life to the cause.

68
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,803
For God. Not for this.

69
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,230
I am the herald of God in this world.

70
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,307
His voice rings ever in my ears.

71
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,485
Perhaps it is not His voice you hear.

72
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,563
How dare you!
I am the voice of the Church.

73
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:33,320
Bathed in truth and blameless
in the light of my Lord.

74
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,494
You are no more than a rogue
with blood on his hands.

75
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,742
Who controls your insolent
tongue, Behmen?

76
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:51,417
Let's get the hell out of here.

77
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:56,922
You cannot leave.

78
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,967
Who's going to stop us?

79
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:38,881
Sheep roaming free
and no shepherd in sight.

80
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,968
- Did they jump the fence?
- All of them?

81
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:47,933
We've been walking all day
and haven't passed a soul.

82
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,443
Keep your souls,
let me find a chicken.

83
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,673
Hello?

84
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,429
Is anyone here?

85
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,811
Hello?

86
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,272
FELSON: What happened to them?

87
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,566
I don't know.

88
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:43,339
FELSON: Seen much death,
you and I.

89
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,345
Some deserved, some not.

90
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,428
But what does one do
to deserve a death like that?

91
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,887
Nothing.

92
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,781
BEHMEN: Finally. A town.

93
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,117
FELSON: We might be recognized.

94
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,499
- We should go around, Behmen.
- Go where?

95
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:16,373
These horses won't carry us.
They're farm animals.

96
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,128
We need proper horses, food.

97
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,585
Provisions.

98
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,683
MAN: Blessings for the poor?

99
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:39,066
- MAN 2: Please let them come to me!
- WOMAN: I beg you!

100
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,522
- Please, no more.
- Take me with you.

101
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,750
MAN 3: Lord almighty, heavenly Father,

102
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:58,877
accept the pain and suffering
we bestow upon ourselves.

103
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:03,712
Find it in your heart to free us
from this terrible...

104
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:06,638
- What madness is this?
- MAN: Plague.

105
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,935
- Plague?
- Like no other.

106
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,763
Pestilence over all the land.

107
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:17,690
- ls there no cure?
- None.

108
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,860
How long has it been so?

109
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,905
Three years and a season.

110
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,200
- How many dead?
- Some say as many as three in four.

111
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:32,327
With my own hands I have buried
two children and the wife who bore them.

112
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,080
But how is it you don't know this?

113
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,537
We're travelers.
We've only recently returned.

114
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:48,263
MAN: Here you are.
Two of my finest.

115
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,056
Thank you.

116
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:00,105
Leave it!

117
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:13,580
- BEHMEN: Felson, this way.
- What is it now?

118
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,783
They saw my sword's crest.

119
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:19,919
I told you we should have
gone around.

120
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:22,669
You two! Stand fast.

121
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,625
Shit.

122
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,111
Fine.

123
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,605
Come with me.

124
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,525
Drop it!

125
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:00,960
MAN: Remove the hood
and the mask.

126
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,467
Arrest these deserters.

127
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:12,764
Wait!

128
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,262
Let me see that.

129
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,942
This is yours?

130
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,563
Follow me.

131
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:35,279
FELSON: I hope we're
on our way to dinner.

132
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,114
BEHMEN: What do you
want with us, priest?

133
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:40,121
That is not for me to say.

134
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,087
Pardon me, Your Eminence.

135
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,389
MAN: What is it, Debelzaq?

136
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,262
DEBELZAQ: This is the knight's sword.

137
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,219
MAN: Come closer.

138
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:18,200
Tell me your name.

139
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,079
I am Behmen of Bleibruk.

140
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:22,910
Behmen.

141
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:27,214
Yes. And your comrade, Felson.

142
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,293
Your names are known to me.

143
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,300
Your victories have become legend.

144
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,767
Yes, I am stricken.

145
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:45,479
- The plague is everywhere.
- It is a curse called up from hell.

146
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,935
Brought upon us by the Black Witch.

147
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,479
The Black Witch?

148
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,861
I myself heard the confession.

149
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,489
The witch must be taken
to the Abbey of Severac,

150
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,075
where the monks possess the last copy

151
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:07,334
of an ancient book of rituals

152
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,712
that will destroy the witch's powers,

153
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,671
and end the plague.

154
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,677
What has this to do with us?

155
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:22,853
Our ranks have been decimated.

156
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,932
You must deliver her.

157
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:31,820
My best knight, Eckhart,
has already pledged his services,

158
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:34,944
as has our priest, Debelzaq.

159
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:37,025
I ask the same of you.

160
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:41,659
Will you serve the Church once more?

161
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,249
I cannot.

162
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:47,328
You swore an oath to God.
Have you been released from this vow?

163
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,333
My vow is to God.

164
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:52,211
Not the men who murder in His name.

165
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,213
You know the penalty for desertion.

166
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,294
I ask you again...

167
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,973
...Behmen of Bleibruk.

168
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,474
Do you serve God and the Church?

169
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,605
I serve the Church no more.

170
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,945
In there. Both of you.

171
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:28,501
What do they do
with deserters anyway?

172
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,250
Hang them?

173
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,957
Burn them?

174
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,635
- Probably both.
- I don't know.

175
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:42,557
If I have any say in the matter,
I'd prefer hanging.

176
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:15,833
- ls that the witch?
- That is not what I see.

177
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,711
FELSON: The priest said she confessed.

178
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,263
We both know the Church
can be most persuasive.

179
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,431
I am sorry I put you into this, Felson.

180
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,858
No. As dungeons go,
this one's not so bad.

181
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,771
We spent nights in much
worse places than this.

182
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:40,574
At least I have. What is that smell?

183
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:44,243
That would be you.

184
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:04,802
"l serve the Church no more."

185
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:10,353
Did you see the priest's face?

186
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:13,272
Looked like someone pissed
in his holy water.

187
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,960
MAN: They are godless people! Infidels!

188
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,465
They have sinned against God
and against His only son, Jesus Christ!

189
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,888
They must be punished!

190
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,591
You want to speak with the cardinal?

191
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,547
Tell him we will deliver the girl
to Severac on one condition:

192
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,347
that she is given a fair trial.

193
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,846
You cannot bargain with the Church.

194
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,848
This is not for your Church.

195
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:37,061
And we will need our weapons returned.

196
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:40,940
And all charges dismissed.

197
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:48,902
We are here. The abbey is here.

198
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:53,411
The distance is nearly 400 leagues.
That's roughly six days' travel.

199
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,539
- As you can see, we charted a course.
- You would lead us through here?

200
00:23:57,994 --> 00:23:59,371
That is the most direct route, yes.

201
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:01,798
Across a river, through...

202
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:05,794
...300 leagues of heavy forest
and a mountain pass.

203
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,050
This forest is called Wormwood.

204
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:09,551
It's not a place to be trifled with.

205
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:12,635
Men have lost their way there,
never to be seen again.

206
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,436
Tell me, priest, have you ever
made the journey yourself?

207
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:19,065
- No.
- Naturally.

208
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,649
DEBELZAQ: But these are
the best maps in the land.

209
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,605
But we would do better to have a guide.

210
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:29,033
You know, someone who
has traveled from here to there.

211
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:32,783
Tax collector perhaps, merchant.

212
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:38,747
There is someone, but...

213
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:44,674
Ah, visitors.
What can I do for you gentlemen?

214
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,923
Perhaps you'd like to pelt me
with fruit or kick me in the groin.

215
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:50,300
You're Hagamar? The swindler?

216
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,008
Yes... I mean, no!

217
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,810
I'm Hagamar,
but I never swindled anyone.

218
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:58,604
I sold relics. Genuine relics.

219
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,353
Where did you sell your trinkets?

220
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:03,651
Everywhere. I have happy
customers from here to Prague.

221
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,992
- And Severac?
- Yes, the monks.

222
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:13,286
I sold them the tail of an ass
ridden in the flight from Egypt.

223
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,034
At a bargain, I'm sure.

224
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,832
Then you know the way to the abbey.

225
00:25:18,491 --> 00:25:19,913
Like the back of my hand.

226
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,420
I'd be happy to draw you a map, only...

227
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,586
The bailiff is prepared to pardon you.

228
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,459
On one condition:

229
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:30,716
you serve as our guide to Severac.

230
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:32,972
Condition accepted.

231
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:36,972
If I were to release you, however,
and you attempt to flee...

232
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:39,179
Such thoughts are beneath you, sir.

233
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:42,061
I swear by all the saints,
may they strike me dead, were I to lie.

234
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:45,735
They would have to
get in line behind me.

235
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,571
Do we understand each other?

236
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,534
DEBELZAQ: The witch is unconscious.

237
00:25:57,614 --> 00:26:00,163
She was given a powerful sedative
in her food last night.

238
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:02,039
Open the cell.

239
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,793
We'll be removing the witch
for transport.

240
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:20,561
She's just a girl.

241
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,098
Don't be deceived.

242
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,116
BEHMEN: Felson!

243
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,616
Hold her! Hold her!

244
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,829
The sooner we get her
to Severac, the better!

245
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,421
Now she's sedated.

246
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:10,437
Who's that?

247
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,069
- The witch.
- Witch?

248
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:15,400
Nobody said anything about a witch.

249
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:18,327
Why did you think we were
going to Severac, to sell trinkets?

250
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,122
- WOMAN: God in heaven...
- MAN: Kill the witch!

251
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:22,949
WOMAN: You gave us this affliction!

252
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:25,034
MAN: You brought
the wrath of God upon us!

253
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:29,373
Take the witch out of our midsts,
and take the plague with you!

254
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:18,550
She's watching me.

255
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:21,641
Put your mind on something else.
She's trying to frighten you.

256
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:23,805
It's working.

257
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,556
How did you come upon this girl?

258
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:32,485
She was found just outside
of Marburg, wandering.

259
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,814
Muttering strange things,
words no one could understand.

260
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,991
This makes her a witch?

261
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:40,034
No, but it's a sign.

262
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:43,033
Within a fortnight of her arrival,
the plague had swept over us.

263
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,953
It was the same
for every town she passed.

264
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:50,916
There was no talk of such a girl
passing through my village.

265
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,294
Yet, the plague came.

266
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,264
She's stronger than she looks.

267
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:13,734
Do you believe she's a witch?

268
00:29:14,477 --> 00:29:17,572
You felt her strength.
Would you say it was that of a girl?

269
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:21,618
I've seen girls destroy men
without lifting a finger.

270
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:26,744
How many times do we need to go over
this? We were in France, for God's sake.

271
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,289
The things she did in the bed chamber.

272
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:34,293
- She robbed you of a year's wages.
- Yes, but...

273
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,921
...she gave me so much in return.

274
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:44,390
Look at us. Barely a month out of
service to the Church and here we are...

275
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:47,264
...deserters in service to the Church.

276
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:53,270
You know we're being followed.

277
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,568
Let's give him a royal welcome.

278
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,260
Come off the horse.

279
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:31,929
Who are you?
Why are you following us?

280
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:33,014
FELSON: Hyah!

281
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,938
I asked you a question, boy.

282
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:40,105
He's an altar boy
in service to the cardinal.

283
00:30:40,188 --> 00:30:43,658
My name's Kay,
and my father was a knight.

284
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:48,079
Jurand of Vollenbad, he also fought at
Imbros, perhaps you've heard his name?

285
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:54,502
- What do you want?
- I want to come with you to Severac.

286
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:56,295
Easy, boy.

287
00:30:57,496 --> 00:31:00,966
To pledge myself to your service.

288
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:03,712
In exchange for which I ask your word

289
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:05,922
that you will vouch for me
upon our return,

290
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,473
so that I may be knighted.

291
00:31:14,096 --> 00:31:18,067
The services of an altar boy.
I feel safer already.

292
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,894
I would have you know
I've ridden in the lists twice.

293
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:21,729
And won flags for valor.

294
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:24,565
This isn't a tournament, boy.
Go back to your mother.

295
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,072
This is a free road, old man.

296
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,370
And I don't need your
permission to travel it.

297
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:32,164
Give the lad a chance
to retract the remark.

298
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,504
My sincere apologies.

299
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:42,091
Not to me, to him.

300
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,919
That I cannot.
He insulted me first.

301
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:50,804
I'm going to teach this one
some manners.

302
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:52,510
Go easy, Felson.
Use the other hand.

303
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,314
I don't want him dead.
Just send him on his way.

304
00:31:57,598 --> 00:32:00,522
- Be quick about it.
- With pleasure.

305
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:19,711
Not bad for an altar boy.

306
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:37,646
What the devil was that?

307
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:40,766
Stand and fight like a man,
you little jackrabbit.

308
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,206
Enough!

309
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,957
Perhaps you can be of service.

310
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:18,142
KAY: I heard what the cardinal said.
About your heroism in the Crusades.

311
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,148
I would have gone too,
but I was too young.

312
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,565
You're one of the lucky ones.

313
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,110
Well, tell me about it.
Where did you enlist?

314
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,161
It was a priest who came
to Felson's village.

315
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:38,707
He told us whoever went on Crusade
would receive blessings from the Church.

316
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,535
Remission from sin.

317
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:44,043
It was the part about sin that
perked young Felson's interest.

318
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:47,295
- That's not true.
- BEHMEN: So he asks the priest,

319
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,503
"What sins would be forgiven?

320
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:51,633
Would they forgive adultery?"

321
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,594
The priest says, “Yes...

322
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,635
...for a two-year pledge."

323
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:00,388
"What about theft?"

324
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:04,150
"Yes... for a three-year pledge."

325
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,819
So Felson mulls it over
and says to the priest,

326
00:34:09,897 --> 00:34:12,070
"Better sign me up for ten."

327
00:34:27,706 --> 00:34:29,049
Brought you some food.

328
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:32,761
And warmth.

329
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:39,180
You're not like the others.

330
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:44,645
You're kind.

331
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,783
Was it Debelzaq who hurt you?

332
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,499
This place you're taking me.

333
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,877
What will happen to me there?

334
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,806
Your innocence or guilt
will be decided.

335
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,602
There was a girl in my village
who was suspected of being a witch.

336
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:27,358
They put stones in her pockets
and cast her into the lake.

337
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,818
If she drowned, they would
have known she was human.

338
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,400
But she didn't.

339
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:37,781
She lived.

340
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:41,989
They called it proof of magic
and burned her at the stake.

341
00:35:43,657 --> 00:35:45,705
Nothing of the kind will happen to you.

342
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,337
You will be given a fair trial.

343
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:51,628
You have my word on that.

344
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,883
She say anything?

345
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:07,439
- Why do you ask?
- I only mean to caution you.

346
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:12,521
The witch is a deceiver.
She'll turn one man against another.

347
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,233
Who's to guard the wagon?

348
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:21,612
Guard the wagon? The girl is caged.

349
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,579
-And I'm tired.
- I will go.

350
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:29,711
Perhaps someone else should
take the first watch.

351
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:34,008
I'll go. I'll go. Don't worry, lad.

352
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,711
There will be plenty of time
between here and Severac.

353
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,796
Eckhart, be watchful.

354
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,490
I came to relieve you.

355
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,706
You're not tired?

356
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,501
No, no.

357
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,084
I don't sleep much these days.

358
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,673
I was thinking about how much the girl
reminds me of my own daughter.

359
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:24,342
I'm sorry for your loss.
What was her name?

360
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,854
Mila. Her name was Mila.

361
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,646
Tell me, Father...

362
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:38,781
You say the cardinal has given his
word that she will have a fair trial.

363
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,826
But has he not also given
his word to end this plague?

364
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,282
What are you suggesting?

365
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:46,580
Can you imagine
the reaction of the people

366
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:48,703
if she were not to be found
guilty of witchcraft?

367
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,044
No, Father.

368
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,419
You know as well as I the Church
cannot afford that. Not now.

369
00:37:56,665 --> 00:38:02,138
No, no. Our responsibility
is to deliver her for trial.

370
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:03,805
The monks will decide her fate.

371
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:07,718
Exactly.

372
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:12,056
The monks will decide her fate.
And I will not be a party to this.

373
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:15,894
Nor will the others, hopefully,
when they have heard what I have to say.

374
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:18,695
Wait! Please don't go!

375
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:23,068
- Please don't leave me alone with him.
- You fear him.

376
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,577
- Listen to me.
- Eckhart!

377
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:31,250
I'm not letting them...

378
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,079
GIRL: Give me that key!

379
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:45,381
How did she escape?

380
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,094
She took the key
from around my neck.

381
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:54,432
Which way did she go?

382
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,279
ECKHART: Maybe she followed
this road to the village.

383
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,750
Kay and Eckhart, that way.

384
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:27,233
KAY: She's in the square!

385
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:32,701
<GRuNTING)

386
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,261
There she is!

387
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:59,951
This is a grave.
This is a mass grave.

388
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,955
GIRL WHISPERING: Papa...

389
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,841
Wait here.

390
00:42:16,842 --> 00:42:18,560
GIRL: Papa!

391
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:20,888
- Mila?
- Papa?

392
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:24,266
I'm here!

393
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,568
Eckhart!

394
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:37,825
- Mila? Mila.
- MILA: Papa.

395
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:39,703
Papa, where are you?

396
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:43,456
- Mila. My child.
- MILA: Papa, is that you?

397
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:47,005
- Don't run away!
- MILA: Papa!

398
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:48,832
ECKHART: Mila!

399
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:55,802
- Papa.
- Mila?

400
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:02,020
Eckhart. Eckhart

401
00:43:02,095 --> 00:43:05,440
Eckhart Felson! Behmen!

402
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:06,937
Where are you?!

403
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:10,358
He came running out of nowhere.

404
00:43:10,437 --> 00:43:12,860
Why didn't he stop?
Why didn't he see me?

405
00:43:15,317 --> 00:43:19,242
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
What have I done?

406
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,204
He looked me in the eye,
but he didn't see me.

407
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:26,662
He... He called me Mila.

408
00:43:38,423 --> 00:43:40,551
FELSON: Behmen!

409
00:43:52,938 --> 00:43:55,441
I had to run.
I had no choice. I...

410
00:43:56,358 --> 00:43:58,656
I couldn't let him touch me again.
I'm so sorry.

411
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:02,080
Please! Please don't take me
back to him, please.

412
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:05,329
Please, I beg... please.

413
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:17,509
DEBELZAQ: Heavenly Father,
we pray thee.

414
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:21,433
Take thy servant Johann Eckhart
unto the heavenly realm.

415
00:44:21,508 --> 00:44:25,138
For he was a soldier of the Cross
and fought in thy name.

416
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,564
And in the name
of thy only son, Jesus Christ.

417
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,607
And thus did he die
for the glory of God.

418
00:44:34,187 --> 00:44:37,191
- Amen.
- Amen.

419
00:44:43,697 --> 00:44:46,291
Would anyone care
to offer some words?

420
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:50,708
Let his sacrifice not be in vain.

421
00:44:57,878 --> 00:44:59,050
Behmen!

422
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:01,890
Behmen, I must speak with you.

423
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,599
What is it now, priest?

424
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:08,680
You must warn the others
to be careful in her presence,

425
00:45:08,764 --> 00:45:10,812
not to discuss personal matters,
things she might use against...

426
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:14,145
Listen to me!
It was the witch killed Eckhart!

427
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:18,907
Now you heard what Kay said.
His mind was not his own.

428
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,235
She overheard us
talking of his daughter.

429
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,367
What exactly are you suggesting?

430
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,411
She sees the weakness
that lies in our hearts.

431
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:30,957
And what she sees there
she will use against us.

432
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:20,177
Crusader.

433
00:46:21,878 --> 00:46:26,429
I'm truly grateful for your help.
You're very brave.

434
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:31,555
A man like you could never stand
to see a young girl come to any harm.

435
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,230
Debelzaq believes you are
to blame for Eckhart's death.

436
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:37,606
And you believe him?

437
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:40,398
After what he did to me?

438
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:45,277
I had no reason to harm Eckhart.
He was nothing but kind to me.

439
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,237
He told me I looked like his daughter.

440
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:53,327
I can see his death weighs
heavy on your mind.

441
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,336
Allow me to ease your pain.

442
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:09,472
Some good deeds can be done
even from behind bars.

443
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:24,487
Kay. Remember this.
It was not your fault.

444
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,986
It was the witch, no one else.

445
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:29,162
He died by my sword.

446
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:30,659
It could just as easily been another's.

447
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:32,707
But it wasn't.

448
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:35,786
It was mine. I killed him.

449
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:55,147
FELSON: Why are we stopped?

450
00:47:56,348 --> 00:47:58,225
You call that a bridge?

451
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,811
Last time I saw it,
it was eight or nine years ago.

452
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:03,484
I remember it differently.

453
00:48:03,563 --> 00:48:06,442
It's our reward for taking
a swindler as our guide.

454
00:48:06,524 --> 00:48:08,367
HAGAMAR: I told you,
I'm not a swindler.

455
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:10,912
FELSON: You're not much
of a guide either, are you?

456
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,829
How are we supposed to get
across this rotting timber?

457
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:16,785
HAGAMAR: You're blaming me
for the bridge?

458
00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:18,290
You're the one who led us to it.

459
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,587
You're the one who...

460
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,999
Behmen.

461
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,547
Behmen!

462
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:17,517
Take everything off the wagon.
Bring the horses across one by one.

463
00:49:30,191 --> 00:49:31,784
It will be on my count of three.

464
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:46,007
One... Two... Three!

465
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,192
My hands!

466
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:19,248
Can't hold on much longer!

467
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,927
Help!

468
00:50:55,068 --> 00:51:00,074
Hagamar! Hitch a rope to the horses
and we'll use them to pull the wagon.

469
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,375
If you let me out, it will be lighter.

470
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:50,422
Please! I can help!

471
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:55,838
- It won't hold!
- It will! Push!

472
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:04,938
GIRL: Push!

473
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:12,188
We won't make it! Let me out!

474
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:21,412
- Come on!
- Push!

475
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,092
Hold it!

476
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:41,724
That was a little too close.

477
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:46,768
I've saved your ass a hundred times.
Have a little faith.

478
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,649
Kay, bring me a fresh wrap
for the priest's hand.

479
00:52:54,479 --> 00:52:56,573
It would be a shame
if he bled to death.

480
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:04,948
Thank you.

481
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,683
Felson!

482
00:53:31,307 --> 00:53:32,650
The flask.

483
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:35,486
Really?

484
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,743
What is this place?

485
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:55,506
Hagamar. Where are we?

486
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,752
Wormwood Forest.

487
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:28,327
HAGAMAR: Damn fog.
Like a veil before my eyes.

488
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:29,908
FELSON: We haven't strayed
from the path, have we?

489
00:54:29,991 --> 00:54:32,289
I can barely see my own hand
in front of my face.

490
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:35,793
The only reason you're around
is because you claimed you knew the way.

491
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,966
I know the way,
I just can't see the way.

492
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,383
Maybe you'd like to try leading
the way then, huh?

493
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:45,640
Enough! Both of you!

494
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:49,436
We'll camp here on the road.
Wait for the fog to pass.

495
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,126
Kay told me what happened
on the bridge.

496
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,840
He says you saved his life.
With one hand.

497
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,388
Hard to believe.

498
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:29,054
We believe what we want to believe.

499
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,148
Do you believe I'm a witch, Behmen?

500
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,480
You're not afraid of me, are you?

501
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,120
Mm...

502
00:55:58,413 --> 00:55:59,960
Mm...

503
00:56:15,346 --> 00:56:16,893
BEHMEN: Trouble sleeping?

504
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,693
Myself as well.

505
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:26,900
Not sure if it's the fog,
the altitude...

506
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,490
It's unsettling.

507
00:56:30,862 --> 00:56:32,239
Even for a knight.

508
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:35,291
Let alone a spineless
scoundrel like myself?

509
00:56:35,366 --> 00:56:37,994
That is not what I meant.

510
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:40,671
No?

511
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:45,548
Behmen, how many more are going to die
before we reach Severac?

512
00:56:45,626 --> 00:56:49,472
- None if I can help it.
- And if you can't? Well, then what?

513
00:56:50,882 --> 00:56:53,601
Forgive me if I seem reluctant
to put my life in your hands.

514
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,223
But I have a better solution.

515
00:56:55,303 --> 00:56:57,726
We kill the bitch.
Here and now and be done with it.

516
00:56:57,805 --> 00:57:01,685
We tell those back in Marburg
she tried to escape. She meant us harm.

517
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:04,021
What could we do?
We had no choice.

518
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:06,990
And who would be the wiser?

519
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,037
I, for one.

520
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,291
Did you hear that?

521
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:26,876
- What is it? What's happening?
- Listen. Be quiet.

522
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:45,895
Wolves.

523
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,452
What do we do?

524
00:57:57,865 --> 00:57:59,742
Kill as many as you can.

525
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:12,282
- Oh, no.
- Get the horses. I'll take the wagon.

526
00:59:18,446 --> 00:59:19,663
Go!

527
00:59:41,093 --> 00:59:42,185
Hyah!

528
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:19,431
FELSON: Behmen!

529
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:26,640
It's too late. We can't help him.

530
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,154
Behmen? What are you doing?

531
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,328
Behmen, what are you doing?

532
01:01:23,404 --> 01:01:26,032
He's doing what comes naturally.
Killing the innocent.

533
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,789
- You cannot do this!
- Step aside.

534
01:01:28,868 --> 01:01:32,372
- Two lives have already been lost.
- No one grieves for that more than I!

535
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,298
Then step aside
or this arrow will be yours.

536
01:01:34,373 --> 01:01:36,796
If we falter now those lives
will have been lost in vain.

537
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:39,800
All will not be lost.
Four lives will be spared.

538
01:01:39,879 --> 01:01:42,223
What are four lives compared with
the thousands more that will be lost

539
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,300
if this plague is not ended? I know!

540
01:01:44,383 --> 01:01:46,511
There may be no room in your
heart for God, Behmen.

541
01:01:46,594 --> 01:01:49,473
But in my heart,
I know He would not abandon us!

542
01:01:49,555 --> 01:01:51,148
In God's name.

543
01:01:51,223 --> 01:01:56,946
No man has spilled more blood
in God's name than I.

544
01:01:58,064 --> 01:02:01,489
A benevolent God would not
ask such things of men!

545
01:02:02,401 --> 01:02:06,247
But if you kill her,
you will not have God to blame.

546
01:02:07,114 --> 01:02:09,037
Only yourself.

547
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,177
The end is in sight.

548
01:02:24,548 --> 01:02:26,425
LOOK.

549
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,352
Severac.

550
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:52,411
FELSON: We've come a long way,
Behmen. Across oceans, deserts.

551
01:02:52,493 --> 01:02:54,712
Seen things few men have seen.

552
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:01,795
When this is over I think I'd like
to see the valley where I was born.

553
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,422
And you?

554
01:03:04,505 --> 01:03:06,428
I have no such yearnings for home.

555
01:03:06,507 --> 01:03:09,636
Oh, well, then come with me.
I will show you my home.

556
01:03:09,718 --> 01:03:14,724
And we will sit in the hall
where my forefathers sat and drink ale.

557
01:03:15,683 --> 01:03:20,655
- Tell tales few men have lived to tell.
- And fewer still will believe.

558
01:03:21,647 --> 01:03:24,446
But we will know the truth, my friend.

559
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,611
We will know.

560
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,087
Hello?

561
01:03:48,632 --> 01:03:50,305
Is anyone there?

562
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:40,400
- FELSON: Where are the monks?
- DEBELZAQ: Chapel.

563
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,319
At this time
they should be in vespers.

564
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:56,037
My brothers, forgive the intrusion,
but we have traveled far...

565
01:05:21,392 --> 01:05:23,190
It cannot be.

566
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:27,735
He would not abandon us.

567
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,652
God would not abandon us.

568
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:48,712
We must go.
There is no hope here. Only the plague.

569
01:05:48,794 --> 01:05:50,216
Go where?

570
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:53,841
These men were our hope.

571
01:05:55,759 --> 01:05:57,056
We are in God's hands now.

572
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,474
Prayer is our only salvation.

573
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:03,059
Our Lord in heaven,

574
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:04,689
- hallowed be thy name.
- BEHMEN: Debelzaq!

575
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:06,896
- Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...
- Debelzaq!

576
01:06:06,979 --> 01:06:08,447
...on earth as it is in heaven.

577
01:06:08,522 --> 01:06:11,116
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses...

578
01:06:11,191 --> 01:06:12,568
- Get up.
- ...as we forgive those...

579
01:06:12,651 --> 01:06:14,198
- ...who trespass against us.
- Get up!

580
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:18,533
- And lead us not into temptation!
- MAN: But deliver us from evil.

581
01:06:45,142 --> 01:06:46,689
Amen.

582
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:54,610
Debelzaq.

583
01:07:05,204 --> 01:07:08,674
The key of Solomon.
The book of which the cardinal spoke.

584
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,636
Within these pages are said
to be all the rituals, prayers,

585
01:07:12,711 --> 01:07:15,715
and incantations used by
holy men throughout the ages

586
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,675
to defend against the forces of evil.

587
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:23,310
Can... you perform the ritual?

588
01:07:34,274 --> 01:07:35,742
What have we here?

589
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,364
Is this the fair trial you
promised me, Behmen?

590
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:42,082
You sealed your own fate.

591
01:07:47,538 --> 01:07:51,293
Let it be known to all here present
and before God himself

592
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:53,844
that this woman stands
accused of witchcraft!

593
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:57,298
That she has admitted to calling up
a plague against all mankind.

594
01:07:57,381 --> 01:08:00,681
I'm flattered.
But I must confess...

595
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,271
...I have deceived you.

596
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:07,350
You think you can save yourself
by recanting, but you're wrong.

597
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:10,607
- Speak the truth now before God!
- The truth?

598
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:14,190
Do not speak to me
of the truth, you hypocrite!

599
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:18,531
For centuries you and your ilk
have been burning, hanging,

600
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:21,113
crucifying anyone
who stood in their way!

601
01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:26,706
In truth, I should thank you.

602
01:08:27,786 --> 01:08:31,541
The Church has sent more souls
to perdition than all the wars,

603
01:08:31,623 --> 01:08:33,876
famines, and pestilences put together.

604
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:38,089
- That is a lie, witch!
- Debelzaq! The ritual.

605
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:57,403
And you, Behmen!
All you needed was a child to save.

606
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,527
Someone to ease your pitiful guilt.

607
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:06,117
Did you truly think that saving one
ragged waif would change anything?

608
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,834
Come, Behmen. Your sins are legion.

609
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:14,417
How many innocent have
fallen beneath that very blade?

610
01:09:16,335 --> 01:09:19,305
They are godless people. Infidels!

611
01:09:19,379 --> 01:09:23,805
They have sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ.

612
01:09:23,884 --> 01:09:25,636
They must be punished!

613
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:28,438
How could you know?

614
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:33,606
This i$ no Witch.

615
01:09:34,728 --> 01:09:36,526
This i$ no Witch.

616
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,034
Do not utter those words!

617
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,622
We're gonna need more holy water.

618
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,551
Here!

619
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:26,548
Tell me, Behmen.

620
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,519
Are we going in there
to defeat the demon...

621
01:11:31,511 --> 01:11:33,184
...or to save the girl?

622
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,400
Both.

623
01:11:37,976 --> 01:11:39,353
Huh.

624
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:46,910
- I found more holy water.
- You've done well.

625
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:53,125
- This is as far as you go, Kay.
- I don't understand.

626
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,918
BEHMEN: This is not your battle.

627
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,668
I took a vow to join your cause.

628
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:02,092
I release you from your vow.
There is no shame in it.

629
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:07,757
Honor is not a thing
to be dismissed or forgotten!

630
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:12,686
A vow must be fulfilled,
else it is no vow at all.

631
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:16,686
- Even at the cost of your life?
- Even then.

632
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:28,072
Kneel, Kay.

633
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,455
Speak after me.

634
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:36,206
- Grant me courage, O Lord.
- Grant me courage, O Lord.

635
01:12:37,202 --> 01:12:41,298
- For I am thy servant.
- For I am thy servant.

636
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:46,053
- And gird me with strength unto battle.
- And gird me with strength unto battle.

637
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:49,678
- That I may crush thine enemies.
- That I may crush thine enemies.

638
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:51,429
As dust before the wind.

639
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,678
As dust before the wind.

640
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:57,139
Amen.

641
01:12:57,222 --> 01:12:59,600
- Amen.
- Amen.

642
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:05,193
Rise a knight.

643
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:18,878
- Felson.
- What is it?

644
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,130
I know in my heart
I have not earned this.

645
01:13:27,419 --> 01:13:29,342
You will.

646
01:13:40,348 --> 01:13:42,396
FELSON: The demon
could have escaped anytime.

647
01:13:42,476 --> 01:13:44,399
Why did it wait
until we reached Severac?

648
01:13:44,478 --> 01:13:46,526
Perhaps escape wasn't its purpose.

649
01:13:48,523 --> 01:13:50,446
It wants to be here.

650
01:13:50,525 --> 01:13:53,404
Debelzaq, you said Eckhart
tried to free her.

651
01:13:53,487 --> 01:13:55,410
And I will not be a party to this.

652
01:13:55,489 --> 01:13:56,911
- MILA: Papa.
- Mila!

653
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:01,291
And he killed him.
And Hagamar too.

654
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:02,791
He stood in its way.

655
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,715
We kill the bitch! Here and
now and be done with it.

656
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:12,631
He wanted to come here
from the very beginning.

657
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:14,261
My God.

658
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:17,136
The sooner we get her
to Severac, the better!

659
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,642
He's right. Everything it's done
has led us here.

660
01:14:41,451 --> 01:14:42,577
Over here.

661
01:14:56,424 --> 01:14:59,473
Why would a dying monk
do this to himself?

662
01:14:59,553 --> 01:15:01,806
Why would he tie himself to a desk?

663
01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:04,937
It's a passage
from the Book of Solomon.

664
01:15:17,153 --> 01:15:18,951
There are more over here.

665
01:15:24,703 --> 01:15:26,125
And more!

666
01:15:37,549 --> 01:15:39,893
They were copying it.

667
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,687
To spread the wisdom of Solomon
to all the corners of the earth,

668
01:15:42,762 --> 01:15:44,605
that the pious might be armed.

669
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,607
It wants the book.

670
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:54,692
That's why the demon deceived us
into believing the girl was a witch.

671
01:15:54,774 --> 01:15:57,402
It knew that a witch
would be brought to those

672
01:15:57,485 --> 01:15:59,863
who possessed the Book of Solomon.

673
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,078
You've seen what this plague has done.

674
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:06,829
If the book were to fall
into the demon's hands...

675
01:16:07,871 --> 01:16:10,169
...we would face
an endless darkness.

676
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,256
It's our last defense.

677
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,679
DEMON: I should thank all of you.

678
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:26,774
You sacrificed so much
to deliver me here.

679
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:30,227
And now you've brought me the book.

680
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,023
Debelzaq.

681
01:16:40,278 --> 01:16:42,531
Silence!

682
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:45,951
- Watch out!
- Behmen!

683
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,142
Where are they?

684
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:10,817
- Who?
- The monks.

685
01:17:17,565 --> 01:17:19,909
You can weaken it!
You have to keep reading.

686
01:18:07,032 --> 01:18:09,285
The head, cut off the head!

687
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,019
They're like cockroaches.

688
01:18:40,815 --> 01:18:41,941
Felson!

689
01:20:27,547 --> 01:20:31,552
You have no idea how that accursed book
has tormented me over the centuries.

690
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:36,561
I destroyed the others.
This is the last one.

691
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:48,159
You'll be buying tonight, my friend.

692
01:21:22,936 --> 01:21:24,813
Felson!

693
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,251
Finish it!

694
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:18,617
Amen!

695
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:16,428
Behmen.

696
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:29,236
What can I do?

697
01:23:32,774 --> 01:23:34,776
Keep her safe.

698
01:24:19,695 --> 01:24:21,663
God be with you, Felson.

699
01:24:31,999 --> 01:24:33,922
It's strange.

700
01:24:36,003 --> 01:24:38,677
To owe so much to someone
I never even knew.

701
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,928
I don't know what to say.

702
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,098
Say what is in your heart.

703
01:24:52,061 --> 01:24:53,813
My name is Anna.

704
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:57,942
I owe you my life.

705
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,454
God keep you.

706
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:24,431
Will you tell me about them?

707
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,229
I want to know them.

708
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:47,493
ANNA: So the plague passed
and life returned to the land.

709
01:25:48,784 --> 01:25:50,457
There are many who say the plague

710
01:25:50,536 --> 01:25:53,460
was nothing but a pestilence
that finally broke,

711
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:55,416
like the passing of a fever.

712
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:59,929
They don't know the darkness
that almost was.

713
01:26:00,713 --> 01:26:05,014
The sacrifices made.
The heroes lost.

714
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:10,182
I will tell their story.
I was there.

715
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:13,192
I know.

716
01:34:00,985 --> 01:34:01,986
