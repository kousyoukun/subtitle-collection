1
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,493
No! I beg you!
I told the truth!

2
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:19,617
There are a witch!

3
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:22,195
My daughter! No!

4
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,811
CITY OF VILLACH
1235 A.D.

5
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:32,826
No!

6
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:36,578
Please!

7
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:40,843
Have you been found guilty of witchcraft
and counsel with the devil.

8
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:43,728
If you want to set free souls

9
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:46,409
you repent and confess your sins.

10
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,331
I confess!

11
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:54,229
Tell me, girl.
You signed a pact with Lucifer?

12
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,531
Yes. I signed a pact.
I confess!

13
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:58,981
I beg you! Take pity!

14
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:02,821
I made a salve for the rider,
but it was pig fat.

15
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:03,488
There was no witchcraft. I swear!

16
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,153
Priest?

17
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:09,744
You will
burn in hell!

18
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,389
Dispose of it.

19
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,042
-No. Please
-No, no!

20
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:22,048
-She is a Witch. Play her!
-No!

21
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:25,569
Wait! You said that I deliver.

22
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:29,744
Soul, child.
Your soul will be saved.

23
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:32,981
The body should be entrusted with the Lord
for the forgiveness of sins.

24
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:37,141
No! I beg you!

25
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,463
Wait!

26
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,048
We need to pull bodies.

27
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:09,036
There are words to be spoken
Solomon's book,

28
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:10,904
not to awaken again.

29
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,363
They were hanged and drowned.

30
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:15,561
I think there are enough dead.

31
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,431
Amen.

32
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:29,495
Witch SEASON

33
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:39,951
GOLF OF EDREMIT
TIME OF THE CROSSED

34
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:42,948
GOLF OF EDREMIT
1332 A.D.

35
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,125
Today was really you
blessed.

36
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:05,295
Today, the fight for God himself.

37
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:07,643
Today, you are holy warriors,

38
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,929
baptized in the blood of pagans.

39
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,337
Look at Those rebels, Behmen.

40
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,620
It is only expected
the Lord to meet him.

41
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,196
I feel sorry for those for whom you are
the last thing they will see.

42
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,674
The only sin
you will face today's defeat.

43
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:28,115
Who kills most
drink for free.

44
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:31,643
I shall take the 300 left,
you the 300 on the right.

45
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:34,920
If I share equal
which of us is honor?

46
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,943
You will do honor.

47
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,494
Prepare for battle!

48
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:42,291
Well. Then kill them all alone 600.

49
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:45,743
Remove swords!

50
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:55,105
Attack!

51
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,403
I feel a terrible thirst.

52
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:48,358
You do honor a friend.

53
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,377
ENCLOSURE TRÍPOLI
1334 A.D.

54
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:07,518
It's time to prove your bravery!

55
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:13,232
-Throw down all...
-Reeling all pagans!

56
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,301
BATTLE OF IMBROS
1337 A.D.

57
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,383
BATTLE OF ARTAH
1339 A.D.

58
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:57,422
Fight until death
the last enemy of God!

59
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,970
Do not you think God
is about enemies?

60
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:05,505
Not to be a friend and it's not easy.

61
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,864
BATTLE OF ESMIRNA
1344 A.D.

62
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:24,322
They are men without God!
Unbelievers!

63
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:29,323
They have sinned against the Lord
and against His only son, Jesus!

64
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:32,088
You must be punished!

65
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:37,944
Do not disappointed!
It was hit with vengeance!

66
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,488
Do not leave anyone alive!

67
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:46,739
Stray Souls
to Hell.

68
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,637
A glorious day for the Church!

69
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:52,503
You call that glorious?
Killing women and children?

70
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:54,723
Take care, Knight.

71
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:56,973
- You swore to serve the cause of life.
- For God.

72
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,515
Not for this.

73
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,879
I am the Lord's language
in this world.

74
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,000
- His voice whispers in my ear.

75
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,195
- Maybe it's not his voice.

76
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:07,602
How dare you?

77
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:09,398
I am the voice of Church!

78
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:11,913
Swimming in the truth and not to blame
in light of the Lord.

79
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:15,170
You are not only
a spot of blood on his hands!

80
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,706
Who is your guide
naughty language, Behmen?

81
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:30,370
Let's get outta here.

82
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,889
There you go!

83
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:39,103
Who's gonna stop us?

84
00:11:56,575 --> 00:12:00,977
Styria COAST
ONE MONTH LATER

85
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:17,552
Goats walking free
no shepherd around.

86
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,477
The pen to be bypassed?

87
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:21,375
All?

88
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,399
We walked all day
and I have not met anyone.

89
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:30,618
Nor need.
I hope to meet a chicken.

90
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:51,525
Hey?

91
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,262
Anybody there?

92
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,218
Hey?

93
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,668
what existed with them?

94
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:51,674
I do not know.

95
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,664
I have seen so much death...

96
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,824
Some deserved, some not.

97
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:27,038
What do you think they did
to deserve such a death?

98
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:28,698
Nothing.

99
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,623
Finally a city!

100
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:46,371
There could be recognized.

101
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,800
Should it go around, Behmen.
Which?

102
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,899
The horses we can handle.
There are horse farms.

103
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:59,108
We need horses
appropriated, food, supplies.

104
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:12,491
A blessing, Mr.?

105
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,332
A blessing, Mr..
Please

106
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,464
Let them come to me!

107
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:18,510
-I beg you!
-Please

108
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,778
- Take me!
- Enough!

109
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:23,598
My children
they are dying!

110
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:25,666
Have mercy of us!

111
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,469
Heavenly Father glorified,

112
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:37,285
receive pain and suffering
that we bring.

113
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:42,113
Liberate us!

114
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:45,718
-What madness is this?
-The plague.

115
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:48,919
Plague?

116
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:51,221
How has never seen.

117
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,777
It included all the land.

118
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:56,632
- There is a cure?
- None.

119
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:58,903
How long is it?

120
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:01,626
This season marks the second year.

121
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:05,612
- How many have died?
- Some say that three or four.

122
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:12,900
Even with my own hands I buried
two children and mother who gave them life.

123
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:14,852
How did you hear that?

124
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:17,762
We travel.
We recently returned.

125
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:26,341
- Here they are.
- The best horse of mine.

126
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:28,332
Thanks.

127
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,698
Forget it!

128
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:50,095
Felson, here.

129
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,784
what?

130
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,342
They saw the cross on the sword.

131
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,915
I told you to go around the city.

132
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,583
You! Traitors!

133
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:03,646
Damn!

134
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:22,745
well.

135
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:25,293
Come with me.

136
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,783
Drop it!

137
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,870
Show your face.

138
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:46,109
Arrest these deserters.

139
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,765
Wait.

140
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,135
Let me see.

141
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,991
It's yours?

142
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,310
Come with me.

143
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,644
I hope we go to dinner.

144
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:15,896
What do you want from us, Priest?

145
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,856
I can not tell you that.

146
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,698
-Excuse me, Your Eminence.
-What, Debelzaq?

147
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,114
This knight's sword.

148
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:38,040
Come here.

149
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:59,479
-Tell me your name.
-I am Behmen de Blybrook

150
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:05,195
Behmen, yes,
and your friend, Felson.

151
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:09,183
Your names are known to me.

152
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:13,524
Your victories have become legends.

153
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:17,863
Yes, I am infected.

154
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:21,608
The plague is everywhere

155
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,323
It's a curse sent from Hell.

156
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:27,052
He was thrown upon us
The Black Witch.

157
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:29,603
Black Witch?

158
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:33,003
I myself have heard the confession.

159
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:38,313
Witch should be taken
Severak the monastery.

160
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:45,309
The monks there have final
copy of an ancient books,

161
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:48,753
rituals that will destroy
witch's powers,

162
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:53,748
and will ward off plague.

163
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:56,356
What this has to do with us?

164
00:19:56,456 --> 00:20:01,256
Our lines were tight.

165
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:04,510
I'll have to go.

166
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:09,919
Best of my knight, Eckhart
has offered help.

167
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,213
So our priest, Debelzaq.

168
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,703
I ask the same thing.

169
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:20,703
Want to serve the church again?

170
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:24,204
- I can not.
- You swore before the Lord.

171
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:27,583
- You have been issued by the oath?
- Lord I swear.

172
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:30,693
There are those who kill in his name.

173
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:32,903
You know the punishment for treason.

174
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:38,303
I ask again,
Behmen de Blybrook

175
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,153
Do you serve for God and church?

176
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:46,216
I no longer serve the church.

177
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,891
Inside.

178
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:55,521
Both

179
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,123
What do deserters?

180
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:09,566
He hangs?

181
00:21:10,874 --> 00:21:12,723
I burn?

182
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:16,345
-I think both.
-Yes.

183
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:21,448
If I had to choose,
I'd rather hang myself.

184
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:51,685
She's the witch?

185
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:54,775
I do not see that.

186
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,833
The priest said she confessed.

187
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:01,583
We both know that the church
can be very persuasive.

188
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:03,502
Yes.

189
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,955
orry that I dragged
into this, Felson.

190
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:11,888
I like dungeons,
and this is not so bad.

191
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:15,163
We spent nights
places more ugly.

192
00:22:15,263 --> 00:22:19,505
I certainly.
What's that smell?

193
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,301
I think it comes from you.

194
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,403
"I no longer serve the church."

195
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,600
Have you seen the priest?

196
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:51,887
As if someone had their needs
the water was blessed.

197
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:16,012
They are men without God!
Unbelievers!

198
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:20,858
They have sinned against the Lord
and against His only son, Jesus!

199
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:23,403
You must be punished!

200
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,983
Want to talk to the Cardinal?

201
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:04,424
Tell him to go to Severak,
one condition.

202
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:06,972
To be judged fairly.

203
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,199
You can not bargain with the church.

204
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,161
No I do for church.

205
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:16,078
Let us give the weapons back.

206
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:19,440
And dismiss all charges
against us.

207
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:26,838
We're here.
Monastery there.

208
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:31,273
The distance is 400 miles.
Six days of travel.

209
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:35,230
-As you can see I set a route.
-Will it guide us around here

210
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:39,828
-This is the most direct route.
-through the river for...

211
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,778
300 miles through dense forest,
and among the mountains?

212
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:48,043
That's Wormwood Forest.
There's a place where to venture.

213
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,715
Many were lost in it,
and I have never been seen before.

214
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:54,308
Tell me, Priest,
you ever go down this road?

215
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:57,755
-No.
-Of course.

216
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:01,750
They are the best maps of the country.

217
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,595
We do better
with an instructor.

218
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:08,173
Someone who already has
traveled a lot...

219
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,553
Perhaps a taxes collector
or a dealer.

220
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,772
There is a person, but...

221
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,874
Visitors. what I can
do do by the gentlemen?

222
00:25:22,974 --> 00:25:25,861
Want to throw fruit at me
or hit me between the legs?

223
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:28,355
You are Hagamar,
Charlatan?

224
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:30,942
Yes. It means, no.

225
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:33,653
I am Hagamar,
but I never fooled anyone.

226
00:25:33,753 --> 00:25:36,688
sell relics.
authentic relics.

227
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:38,802
Where you sell your goods?

228
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:42,790
Everywhere.
We have customers from here to Prague.

229
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:47,758
-And in Severak?
-Yes, the monks.

230
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:51,547
We sold a comet tail
and a flag of Egypt.

231
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,673
A bargain, surely.

232
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,296
Then you know the way to the monastery?

233
00:25:56,396 --> 00:25:58,146
Like the backhand.

234
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:01,304
I should draw a map, but...

235
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:06,223
The jailer is prepared to release,
With one condition.

236
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:11,353
-You will be our tutor to Severak.
-Acceptable condition.

237
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,452
But if you let go,
and try to run...

238
00:26:15,552 --> 00:26:17,289
Such thoughts dishonor you.

239
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:21,056
I swear by all the saints,
to crap where I live that lie.

240
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:24,505
I'm ahead of you in line.

241
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:27,391
Are we clear?

242
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,571
witch is unconscious.

243
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:38,389
I put something in the food to comfort her.

244
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:40,274
Open prison.

245
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,353
Witch will prepare for the trip.

246
00:26:57,353 --> 00:27:01,291
-It's just a child.
-Do not be fooled.

247
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,578
Felson!

248
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,056
Hold it!

249
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,138
The faster we get
the Severak, the better.

250
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,504
Now it's quiet.

251
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,561
Who is she?

252
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:50,772
- Witch.
- Witches?

253
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,153
Said nothing of any witch.

254
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:56,411
What did you think we do Severak,
sell amulets?

255
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:59,284
-Kill the witch!
-That is not a woman!

256
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:03,098
-You've infected us!
-Did you angry with God!

257
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:07,469
Go back to hell, and plague take you!

258
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,591
Vanish with this woman!

259
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:11,724
Demonule!

260
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,478
I am concerned.

261
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,165
Think of something else.
Try to scare you.

262
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:02,023
And fails.

263
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:06,923
How you gave this girl?

264
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:10,298
It was found
Maburn outside the city,

265
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,785
wandering and grumbling words
that one can not understand them.

266
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,788
- And this one is a witch?
- No, but it's a sign.

267
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:21,545
On the fourth day after her arrival,
plague was upon us.

268
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:24,574
As in every city
went through.

269
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:26,447
By my village
no one saw her passing.

270
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,245
By my village
no one saw her passing.

271
00:29:29,345 --> 00:29:32,010
And yet, the plague was rushed.

272
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:47,747
It's stronger than it appears.

273
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:52,077
You think it's a witch?

274
00:29:52,431 --> 00:29:55,722
I've felt the power.
You think a kid is that?

275
00:29:55,822 --> 00:29:59,223
I have seen children destroying men
without raising a finger.

276
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:04,983
Whenever you want to discuss this?
I was in France!

277
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:08,018
And I'm not complaining.

278
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:10,718
You stole a full year salary.

279
00:30:10,818 --> 00:30:12,359
Yes, but...

280
00:30:12,459 --> 00:30:15,603
... gave me so much in return.

281
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,086
Look at us.

282
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:22,388
I went a month or the church service,
and here are we.

283
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,404
Deserters in the
service of the church.

284
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:31,785
You know that we watch.

285
00:30:35,493 --> 00:30:37,761
Let's welcome him properly.

286
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:59,503
Dismounted.

287
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:10,338
Who are you and why are we watching?

288
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:14,001
I asked you something.

289
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,977
It's an altar boy
in the service of Cardinal.

290
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,516
My name is Kay.

291
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,869
My father was a knight.

292
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:24,317
Yuran Wolenbar.
He struggled to embrace.

293
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,306
You may have heard of him.

294
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:30,221
What?

295
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:32,470
Let go with you to Severak.

296
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,363
Easy, boy.

297
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:38,936
To catch me in your service

298
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:43,642
Instead, ask to promise me
that I'll put a good word to return

299
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:46,055
to become a knight.

300
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:55,529
An altar boy services.
I feel safer already.

301
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:59,602
I was twice on the list,
flags and won for bravery.

302
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:02,240
That is not a tournament, boy.
Come back to your mother.

303
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,586
The road is for everyone, mate.

304
00:32:04,686 --> 00:32:07,204
I need your permission
to travel on it.

305
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:10,660
Give him a chance to withdraw his words.

306
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:16,819
My sincere apologies.

307
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,962
Not to me. His.

308
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:22,984
I can not. He insulted me first.

309
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,438
You teach him good manners.

310
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:30,784
Take it easy, Felson.
Use your other hand.

311
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:33,997
We do not want to kill him.
Send it back.

312
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:36,699
And hurry.

313
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,677
You're welcome.

314
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:57,290
Not bad for an altar boy.

315
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:15,706
What the hell was that?

316
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:19,162
Fight like a man, fricosule.

317
00:33:32,658 --> 00:33:34,076
Enough!

318
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,921
Maybe you can help.

319
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,825
I heard what the Cardinal said.

320
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:56,668
about your heroism of the Crusades.

321
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,152
I come and I
but I was too young.

322
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,849
If you're lucky.

323
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:05,799
Tell me where you enrolled?

324
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:11,676
There was a priest in his village Felson.

325
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:14,090
He said that whoever comes in the Crusades,

326
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,475
will receive the blessing of the church

327
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:18,674
and forgiveness of sins.

328
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:21,822
Part sins
Felson's caught his attention.

329
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:25,010
-It is not true.
-Then he asked to the priest:

330
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:29,407
"what sins would be forgiven?
Would forgive adultery?"

331
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:31,094
The priest said:

332
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:35,381
"Yes, if you serve two years."

333
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,242
"What about robbery?"

334
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,774
"Yes, if you serve three years."

335
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:47,111
So he leans Felson
and tells the priest:

336
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,992
"Sign me up for ten years."

337
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:06,919
I brought food.

338
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:09,942
And blankets.

339
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,747
You're not like the others.

340
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,989
You're good.

341
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,458
Debelzaq you did wrong?

342
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:47,520
The place where I go...

343
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,637
What will happen to me there?

344
00:35:50,737 --> 00:35:54,470
It will decide
if you are guilty or not.

345
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:59,110
It was a girl in my village
suspected to be witches.

346
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:06,126
They tied a stone
and threw it into the lake.

347
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:10,812
If you drown,
would know that it's not a witch.

348
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:12,935
But not drowned.

349
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:15,669
She survived.

350
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:20,020
We called it proof of witchcraft,
and burned at the stake.

351
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:23,776
Thee and will not happen.

352
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,287
It will have a just trial.

353
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:29,196
You have my word.

354
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,644
Did she tell something?

355
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:42,785
why question?

356
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:45,027
I only want alert him.

357
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:47,814
The witch is artful.

358
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,244
She plays a man against the another.

359
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:55,005
We have to watch for cart.

360
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:59,203
watch the cart?
The girl is caged!

361
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:02,757
-And I am tired.
-I go.

362
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:07,426
Maybe you should stay
else to watch.

363
00:37:07,526 --> 00:37:09,761
I'll go.

364
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,965
Do not worry, boy.
You have time to Severak.

365
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,649
Eckhart, be careful.

366
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:38,579
I came to your place.

367
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:43,940
Do not you tired?

368
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,998
No, no.

369
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:50,365
Not much sleep lately.

370
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:56,312
I thought about how much
girl reminds me of my daughter.

371
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,719
I'm sorry by your loss.

372
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,855
What was the name of her?

373
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:03,975
Mila

374
00:38:04,512 --> 00:38:06,300
The name of her was Mila.

375
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:11,077
Tell me, priest.

376
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:16,070
The cardinal gave its word
that he would receive a fair trial.

377
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,631
But he gave the word
that will put and end to the plague?

378
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:21,692
What do you mean?

379
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:26,561
Think about what people say
if he would be found guilty.

380
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,299
Priest, just as I know

381
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:33,230
which the Church can
not afford it. Not now.

382
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,321
No.

383
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:39,159
Our duty is so go
trial.

384
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:41,495
The monks will decide his fate.

385
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:44,787
Exactly.

386
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:46,936
The monks will decide his fate.

387
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:49,116
And I do not want to take part in it.

388
00:38:49,216 --> 00:38:52,932
And hopefully no others
when they hear what I said.

389
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:55,886
Wait!

390
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:58,841
Please, do not me let
alone with him.

391
00:38:59,492 --> 00:39:01,204
Is it afraid of his

392
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:06,792
-Hear me.
-Eckhart!

393
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,124
Give me this key!

394
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:23,227
How to escape?

395
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:28,149
She grabbed the key from the neck!

396
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:31,973
In which part of the run?

397
00:39:39,514 --> 00:39:42,154
Maybe it went on the
path towards the village.

398
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,004
Kay Eckhart and there.

399
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,813
She's in the market!

400
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,747
there she is

401
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:34,863
It is a grave.

402
00:42:34,963 --> 00:42:37,053
A mass grave.

403
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:41,551
Father!

404
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:44,412
Where you...

405
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,241
-Father!
-Mila?

406
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,946
Dad?

407
00:42:59,442 --> 00:43:01,160
I am here.

408
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:10,972
Eckhart!

409
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:13,350
-Mila?
-Daddy.

410
00:43:13,656 --> 00:43:16,439
-Mila?
-Daddy, where are you

411
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:20,733
-Mila, my daughter!
-Daddy, are you?

412
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,260
Do not run away from.

413
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,784
Dad!

414
00:43:24,884 --> 00:43:26,368
Mila!

415
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:30,370
Daddy.

416
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,782
Mila?

417
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:37,226
Eckhart!

418
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,737
Eckhart!

419
00:43:40,214 --> 00:43:42,402
Felson!
Behmen!

420
00:43:42,502 --> 00:43:44,115
Where are you?

421
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:46,813
He appeared in a hurry.

422
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:50,455
Why not stop?
Why can not I see?

423
00:43:51,982 --> 00:43:54,373
God, what have I done?

424
00:43:54,664 --> 00:43:56,457
what did I do?

425
00:43:57,104 --> 00:44:00,060
I looked into my eyes,
but did not see me.

426
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:04,055
He called me Mila.

427
00:44:15,426 --> 00:44:16,896
Behmen.

428
00:44:29,557 --> 00:44:32,831
He had to flee,
I had no choice.

429
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:35,757
I could not leave to touch me again.
I'm so sorry

430
00:44:35,857 --> 00:44:38,678
Please
I do not go back to it.

431
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:43,508
Please, I implore.
Please. No.

432
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,976
Please

433
00:44:52,618 --> 00:44:54,829
Heavenly Father, we pray Thee.

434
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:58,637
Take it to your servant, Johan Eckhard,
the kingdom of Heaven

435
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:02,633
for he was a soldier of the cross
and fought in thy name

436
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,634
Your name and the only son
Jesus Christ.

437
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:10,220
Thus died
for God's glory.

438
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:12,561
Amen.

439
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:14,404
Amen.

440
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:23,092
Anybody want to say
few words?

441
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:28,386
Whether it's sacrifice
not be in vain.

442
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:37,102
Behmen.

443
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:40,067
I need to speak with you.

444
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:43,113
what is now, priest?

445
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:46,619
I must warn others
to be careful around her.

446
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:49,179
Things that she can use...
Listen me

447
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,414
Eckhard witch killed.

448
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:56,311
You heard what Kay said.
It was not sane.

449
00:45:56,411 --> 00:45:58,912
We heard speaking
about his daughter.

450
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:01,414
And what you propose, exactly?

451
00:46:01,514 --> 00:46:04,710
She sees weakness
that dwells in our hearts.

452
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,844
And everything he sees,
will use against us.

453
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:57,547
Cruciatule!

454
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:01,133
I am grateful
for your help.

455
00:47:02,023 --> 00:47:03,793
You're very brave.

456
00:47:04,977 --> 00:47:08,877
A man like you would not accept
as a young woman to hurt.

457
00:47:08,977 --> 00:47:12,477
Debelzaq thinks you're guilty
Eckhard's death.

458
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,016
And you believe that?

459
00:47:15,598 --> 00:47:17,832
After what he did?

460
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:22,216
I had no reason to do wrong.
Has always been kind to me.

461
00:47:22,316 --> 00:47:24,710
He said that fellow
with his daughter.

462
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:30,510
I see death
you press.

463
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:35,630
Allow me to and alleviate suffering.

464
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,417
Some good things can be achieved
even behind bars.

465
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:01,636
Kay, remember,
it was not your fault.

466
00:48:01,736 --> 00:48:03,980
It was the witch.
Nobody else.

467
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,994
He died by my sword.

468
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:09,189
-Could be to anyone.
-But it was not!

469
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,307
It was by my.

470
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,230
It was mine. I've killed him.

471
00:48:29,352 --> 00:48:31,452
Why stop?

472
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,775
How is this bridge?

473
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:37,744
Last time I saw
eight or nine years ago.

474
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:40,018
I remember that look different.

475
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:42,915
So we need that he is a biter
as a guide.

476
00:48:43,015 --> 00:48:44,984
I have said,
I'm not a biter.

477
00:48:45,084 --> 00:48:47,519
Do not really guide you, eh?

478
00:48:48,978 --> 00:48:51,439
How to go
beams over this rotten?

479
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:53,378
Blame me
for the bridge?

480
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:55,240
You're the one
which led us towards him.

481
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,909
You're the one...

482
00:48:57,247 --> 00:48:58,757
Behmen.

483
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,494
Behmen!

484
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,994
Take everything from the cart.

485
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:54,704
Move horses. One by one.

486
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,142
When I'm number three.

487
00:50:19,454 --> 00:50:23,588
One, two, three.

488
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,839
My hands!

489
00:50:55,116 --> 00:50:57,774
Not much anymore!

490
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:15,857
Help!

491
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:34,700
Hagamar, tie ropes of horses.

492
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,959
A to use it to pull the wagon.

493
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,660
If I let it go,
it will be easier.

494
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:27,855
Please, help!

495
00:52:29,482 --> 00:52:32,950
-Not one to resist.
-Yes. Push!

496
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:42,241
Push!

497
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:46,939
I will not succeed.

498
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:49,650
Leave me out.

499
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:58,867
-Go!
-Push!

500
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:19,511
It was as on-here!

501
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:21,865
I saved hundreds of times.

502
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,990
Have some faith.

503
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:30,853
Kay, bring me a clean bandage
for priest's hand.

504
00:53:30,953 --> 00:53:33,608
It would be a shame to bleed
to death.

505
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:41,153
Thank you.

506
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:01,459
Felson!

507
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:11,359
Serious?

508
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:26,132
What is this place?

509
00:54:29,176 --> 00:54:32,153
Hagamar, where are we?

510
00:54:33,498 --> 00:54:35,723
In Wormwood Forest.

511
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:05,842
A damn fog.
It's like a veil in sight.

512
00:55:05,942 --> 00:55:07,810
I hope we never lost.

513
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,410
I hardly see my hand
in sight.

514
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,319
The only reason you're with us
s because you said that you know the road.

515
00:55:13,419 --> 00:55:15,870
I know the way, but do not see him.

516
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,342
I know.

517
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,005
Kay told me what
happened on the bridge.

518
00:55:55,468 --> 00:55:59,866
He said that it saved his life
with only a hand.

519
00:56:00,158 --> 00:56:02,470
It is hard to believe.

520
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,272
I thought what we impose
believe.

521
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:11,965
And you think they are witches,
Behmen?

522
00:56:14,396 --> 00:56:16,197
You're not afraid of me...

523
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:18,723
It has?

524
00:56:52,693 --> 00:56:54,973
Do not you sleep?

525
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:58,185
Neither do I.

526
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:05,528
Do not know if it's because of fog,
Altitude...

527
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:08,470
It's unsettling.
Even for a knight.

528
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,915
Even for a
coward wretch like me

529
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:14,244
It was not that
which I meant

530
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:16,990
No?

531
00:57:18,653 --> 00:57:22,218
Behmen, how many will die
up to reach a Severak?

532
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:25,179
- None, though I oppose it.
- And if you can not?

533
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:26,643
Then what happens?

534
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:30,311
Forgive me if I hesitate
I leave my life in your hands

535
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:33,057
But I have a better solution.
A kill the bastard!

536
00:57:33,157 --> 00:57:35,009
Right here and right now.

537
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:37,288
Tell other
he tried to escape.

538
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:38,704
She wanted our hardly.

539
00:57:38,804 --> 00:57:40,988
What was I to do? I had no choice.

540
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,663
Who would contradict?

541
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,504
I, for example.

542
00:57:59,515 --> 00:58:01,061
Have you heard?

543
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:04,404
- What? What happened?
- Listen.

544
00:58:21,136 --> 00:58:22,970
Wolves.

545
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:31,131
what do we do?

546
00:58:34,037 --> 00:58:36,450
Kill as many as you can.

547
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,821
No way.

548
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:50,305
Take the horses. I take the cart.

549
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,027
Behmen.

550
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:03,313
It's too late.
We can not help.

551
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:57,273
Behmen! What are you doing?

552
01:01:58,427 --> 01:01:59,837
Behmen! What are you doing?

553
01:01:59,937 --> 01:02:02,700
Is what he knows best,
kill the innocent.

554
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,254
You can not do that!

555
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,783
Get away.
Two lives were already lost.

556
01:02:06,883 --> 01:02:08,609
And no one suffers
more than me.

557
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:10,710
Then get out of my way
or arrow that is yours!

558
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,500
If we fail now, those lives
were wasted in vain.

559
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,412
Not everything will be lost.
Four people will stay alive.

560
01:02:16,512 --> 01:02:20,135
What counts four lives, compared
with tens of thousands will be lost,

561
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:23,018
I know, maybe in your heart
not a place for God, Behmen.

562
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,785
But in my heart
I know that he would not abandon us.

563
01:02:25,885 --> 01:02:27,350
For God's sake...

564
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:33,912
No one has shed more blood,
the name of God than me.

565
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:37,967
Too-good God
would require something like a man.

566
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:42,599
If you kill
you can not blame God

567
01:02:43,353 --> 01:02:45,195
only yourself.

568
01:02:57,593 --> 01:02:59,631
We are approaching the end of the road.

569
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,664
Look.

570
01:03:03,162 --> 01:03:04,803
Severak.

571
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:25,130
I came a long way, Behmen.

572
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,972
I have crossed oceans, deserts...

573
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:30,482
I saw things that few have seen...

574
01:03:33,714 --> 01:03:37,614
When all will end,
I want to see the valley where I was born.

575
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,456
And you?

576
01:03:40,556 --> 01:03:42,678
I'm not struggling homesickness.

577
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,508
Then come with me.

578
01:03:47,608 --> 01:03:51,242
We will stay in the house porch
olovina and drink,

579
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:54,668
and known only to tell our stories
The few who survived.

580
01:03:54,945 --> 01:03:57,349
If they will remain so few,
Who will believe us?

581
01:03:58,118 --> 01:04:00,880
We will know the truth, buddy.

582
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:03,437
We will know it...

583
01:04:19,525 --> 01:04:21,344
Anybody?

584
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:26,695
Is anyone there?

585
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:15,820
Where are the monks?

586
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,977
In the chapel. To the this hour,
should be doing the prayers.

587
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,813
Brothers, sorry mess,
But come this far.

588
01:05:57,157 --> 01:05:59,181
No way.

589
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:04,303
We would not abort.

590
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:08,179
God would not abandon us

591
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:24,849
We must make a move.
Here we have no hope. Only plague...

592
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:26,693
But where to go?

593
01:06:28,181 --> 01:06:30,690
These people would have helped us.

594
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:36,470
By now, everything depends on God.
Prayer is our only salvation.

595
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:39,719
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name...

596
01:06:39,819 --> 01:06:40,904
Debelzaq!

597
01:06:41,004 --> 01:06:42,331
Thy kingdom come

598
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,551
-Thy will be done...
-Debelzac!

599
01:06:44,651 --> 01:06:46,683
This day our daily bread
Give us this day

600
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:49,150
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive our debtors

601
01:06:49,383 --> 01:06:50,150
Get up!

602
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,030
And lead us not into temptation

603
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:54,750
But deliver us from evil...

604
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,758
Amen.

605
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,788
Debelzaq.

606
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:44,887
Solomon's Key.
Paper-speaking cardinals.

607
01:07:45,565 --> 01:07:48,638
In its pages it says that it is
all the rituals, prayers,

608
01:07:48,638 --> 01:07:51,671
and incantations used
church people

609
01:07:51,771 --> 01:07:54,155
over the centuries
to ward off evil forces.

610
01:07:55,153 --> 01:07:56,490
You...

611
01:07:57,598 --> 01:07:59,562
... you to fulfill the rituals?

612
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:11,959
what we have here?

613
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:15,446
That's right court
that you promised me, Behmen?

614
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:17,997
Single and have decided his fate.

615
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:27,139
Let all who are here,
the Lord, to know

616
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:30,044
that this woman
is accused of witchcraft,

617
01:08:30,144 --> 01:08:33,243
and acknowledged that sparked plague
against all mankind.

618
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:35,168
I'm flattered!

619
01:08:35,268 --> 01:08:37,183
But I must admit...

620
01:08:38,225 --> 01:08:40,328
I have deceived all...

621
01:08:40,428 --> 01:08:43,365
You think you can save by withdrawing your
words, but not so.

622
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,108
Speak the truth
before God!

623
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,854
Truth?

624
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:50,358
Do not talk to me about truth,
ipocritule!

625
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:55,698
For centuries the whole, you and people like you
you have burned, hanged, crucified,

626
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,751
all those who stood
way.

627
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:03,205
In fact,
you should thank.

628
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,936
The church sent more souls
to Perdition

629
01:09:06,036 --> 01:09:10,029
than all the wars, ciumele
and hunger in one place.

630
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:14,095
-That's a lie, vrajitoareo!
-Debelzaq, rite!

631
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,408
And you, Behmen?

632
01:09:31,508 --> 01:09:34,166
It was not only needed to save a child.

633
01:09:34,266 --> 01:09:37,150
Someone to ease your
deserves all the blame for mercy.

634
01:09:37,624 --> 01:09:42,091
Do you really believe that saving a child,
you change anything?

635
01:09:43,143 --> 01:09:46,698
Come Behmen.
Your sins are legendary.

636
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,796
How many innocents have you killed
with your own sword?

637
01:09:51,935 --> 01:09:55,295
They are godless men.
Heathens!

638
01:09:55,395 --> 01:09:59,369
They were wrong against the Lord
and his only son, Jesus Christ.

639
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:01,196
Must be punished!

640
01:10:02,761 --> 01:10:04,354
How do you know?

641
01:10:08,327 --> 01:10:10,209
That's not a witch!

642
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,959
This is not a witch...

643
01:10:16,435 --> 01:10:18,017
EXORCISM

644
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,389
Do not read those words!

645
01:11:46,198 --> 01:11:48,431
We need more
holy water.

646
01:11:55,873 --> 01:11:57,448
Here!

647
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:02,110
Tell me, Behmen...

648
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:09,388
We go there to destroy the demon
or to save face?

649
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,918
Both.

650
01:12:19,488 --> 01:12:21,493
I found holy water

651
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:23,379
You did well.

652
01:12:25,499 --> 01:12:27,456
So here you go, Kay.

653
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:30,863
-I did not understand.
-It's not your war.

654
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:34,401
I made a vow
I join your cause.

655
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:38,020
Release you from your vow.
There's no shame in it.

656
01:12:38,994 --> 01:12:43,364
The honor is not something that can
be neglected or forgotten.

657
01:12:44,691 --> 01:12:48,230
An oath must be taken to end
otherwise not swear at all.

658
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,381
Even with the cost of your life?

659
01:12:50,481 --> 01:12:52,578
Even so

660
01:13:01,972 --> 01:13:04,056
Kneel, Kay.

661
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,142
Speak for me.

662
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:12,511
- Give me courage, Lord...
- Give me courage, Lord...

663
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:17,227
- For I am your servant.
- For I am your servant.

664
01:13:17,327 --> 01:13:21,786
- Give me strength to fight...
- Give me strength to fight...

665
01:13:21,886 --> 01:13:25,288
- To destroy my enemies...
- To destroy my enemies...

666
01:13:25,388 --> 01:13:31,128
- As dust before the storm.
- As dust before the storm.

667
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:33,864
-Amen.
-Amen.

668
01:13:33,964 --> 01:13:35,360
Amen.

669
01:13:38,711 --> 01:13:40,488
Get up as a knight.

670
01:13:50,253 --> 01:13:51,982
Felson.

671
01:13:52,868 --> 01:13:54,707
what?

672
01:13:55,316 --> 01:13:57,990
Deep in the heart,
I know I deserve it.

673
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:04,643
But it will do.

674
01:14:15,672 --> 01:14:18,036
Demon could escape
at any moment.

675
01:14:18,136 --> 01:14:20,237
Why wait
until I reached Severak?

676
01:14:20,337 --> 01:14:22,806
Can not escape
was its purpose.

677
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,818
He wanted to get here.

678
01:14:25,918 --> 01:14:28,990
Debelzaq, you said you tried Eckhard
to release.

679
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:31,203
Not one to be adept at it.

680
01:14:31,303 --> 01:14:32,929
- Dad!
- Nina!

681
01:14:33,975 --> 01:14:37,010
He then killed. So the Hagamar.
He stood in his way.

682
01:14:37,357 --> 01:14:38,861
He stayed on the way of him.

683
01:14:38,961 --> 01:14:42,128
Fucking kill her!
Even now, we get rid of it.

684
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,297
God!

685
01:14:50,397 --> 01:14:52,742
The more Severak go faster,
the better.

686
01:14:52,842 --> 01:14:55,990
He's right. All that was done,
led us here.

687
01:15:17,871 --> 01:15:19,355
Here.

688
01:15:31,922 --> 01:15:35,122
Why did they do, a dead monk,
that?

689
01:15:35,222 --> 01:15:38,044
Why would bind to office?

690
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:41,181
It's a passage from
Book of Solomon.

691
01:15:53,552 --> 01:15:55,264
Here are more.

692
01:16:00,843 --> 01:16:02,420
And others.

693
01:16:12,716 --> 01:16:14,825
Copy.

694
01:16:14,925 --> 01:16:18,859
To spread the philosophy of Solomon
All over the world

695
01:16:18,959 --> 01:16:20,341
and more than that.

696
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:25,574
Will Book!

697
01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:28,589
So the demon has deceived us to believe
that girl is a witch.

698
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:30,430
which the girl was a witch.

699
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:35,216
He knew that a witch will be taken before
those holding the Book of Solomon.

700
01:16:36,035 --> 01:16:38,828
You saw what he did this plague...

701
01:16:39,546 --> 01:16:42,692
If a book to arrive
in the hands of the demon,

702
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:45,796
We will be cursed
the dark forever.

703
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:48,614
This is our last refuge.

704
01:16:49,013 --> 01:16:51,530
You should thank everyone.

705
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:02,509
You have sacrificed so much
bring it to me here

706
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:06,593
and now I've brought the book.

707
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,350
Debelzaq...

708
01:17:16,946 --> 01:17:18,479
Quiet!

709
01:17:19,985 --> 01:17:21,811
- Warning!
- Behmen!

710
01:17:41,621 --> 01:17:44,197
-Where am I?
-who?

711
01:17:45,044 --> 01:17:46,805
monks?

712
01:17:52,532 --> 01:17:55,875
You can destroy!
Continue reading.

713
01:18:42,294 --> 01:18:44,796
Cape...
Cut off his head!

714
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,472
They're like cockroaches.

715
01:19:16,187 --> 01:19:17,639
Felson!

716
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:04,561
It does not do ideia of as
this damned book

717
01:21:04,661 --> 01:21:07,072
it has me tormentado
along centuries!

718
01:21:07,954 --> 01:21:11,818
We destroyed the others.
This is the last.

719
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:23,797
Tonight everything is over.

720
01:21:57,915 --> 01:21:59,317
Felson!

721
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:22,159
Stop reading!

722
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,103
Behmen...

723
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,014
What should I do?

724
01:24:07,477 --> 01:24:09,821
Take care of her.

725
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:56,919
God be with you, Felson.

726
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:08,630
It's strange...

727
01:25:10,715 --> 01:25:14,155
Do I owe so much
someone I've never even met.

728
01:25:15,897 --> 01:25:18,197
I do not know what to say.

729
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,476
Say what you heart leads you.

730
01:25:26,565 --> 01:25:28,798
My name is Anna.

731
01:25:30,847 --> 01:25:33,268
I owe my life.

732
01:25:34,642 --> 01:25:36,810
God bless.

733
01:25:56,836 --> 01:25:59,151
You tell me about them?

734
01:26:00,093 --> 01:26:02,245
I want to know.

735
01:26:18,775 --> 01:26:23,015
And so, the plague has passed
and life is back among us.

736
01:26:23,993 --> 01:26:28,635
Many say that the plague was not only
a plague that has passed

737
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:31,237
just as you pass a fluster.

738
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:35,470
They know that the darkness
was close.

739
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:38,509
That sacrifices were made...

740
01:26:38,863 --> 01:26:41,064
Heroes that were lost...

741
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,273
I'll tell the story.

742
01:26:44,673 --> 01:26:46,613
I was there

743
01:26:47,322 --> 01:26:48,985
I know
