1
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:32,473
Sue, don't misunderstand me.

2
00:00:32,678 --> 00:00:38,036
I'm not complaining about your work.
I have your latest piece here, it's great.

3
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,314
But you were due back yesterday.

4
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:43,555
But Richard, there's one more story
I just have to do.

5
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:47,671
- There's always one more story.
- But listen to this.

6
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,553
Last month this guy in the Northern
Territory was attacked by a crocodile.

7
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:56,314
It bit his leg right off, left him there
to die a hundred miles from nowhere.

8
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:59,794
A week later he crawls out of the bush,
gets patched up and disappears.

9
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:03,713
No interviews, no pictures, nothing.
I tracked him down.

10
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,997
He runs a safari business out
of somewhere called Walkabout Creek.

11
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:11,671
And his name... get this.

12
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,870
Michael J. Crocodile Dundee.

13
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:19,514
Even if this is for real,
it could take weeks to nail him down.

14
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:24,115
I've made arrangements to meet him,
I got a chopper meeting me,

15
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:26,713
I'll be there tonight.

16
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:30,115
Yeah... OK...

17
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,515
- I really miss you, darling.
- I miss you, too.

18
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,154
- Take care now.
- Don't worry, I'm a New Yorker!

19
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:27,987
Walter Reilly, Never-Never Safaris.
I'm Mr Dundee's business partner.

20
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:31,435
- Nice to meet you, Mr Reilly.
- Please, call me Walter.

21
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,795
We're pretty informal in the bush.

22
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,154
No... let me.

23
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:48,234
There you go.

24
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,513
- You all right?
- Yes.

25
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,513
I'm sorry that Mr Dundee isn't here
himself to meet you, but...

26
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:06,034
...he is here in town... somewhere.

27
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,034
Welcome to Walkabout Creek.

28
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:53,396
I took the liberty of booking you
into our hotel. I trust that's in order?

29
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:57,153
- Sounds just fine.
- There's just one other thing...

30
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:02,796
You did say that you were prepared
to pay the 2,500 dollars?

31
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,158
Absolutely. And I'll see where
he was attacked and how he survived?

32
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:13,756
Miss, I assure you you're gonna spend
a few wonderful days here.

33
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:35,076
Five bucks, anyone
who can make Donk spill it.

34
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:41,717
- What's the sideshow all about?
- Just the boys having fun and games.

35
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,912
Donk's never spilled a drop.
We're a pretty tough breed up here.

36
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,874
- And your Mr Dundee, does he...
- No, he's very reserved.

37
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,712
He's a legend up here.

38
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,434
There he was doing a quiet spot
of fishing when all of a sudden... bang!

39
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:07,158
This giant crocodile came up,
turned him over, bit half his leg off,

40
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:09,309
dragged him down under.

41
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:11,311
Killed it, of course.

42
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:18,117
I mean, any normal man would have
just turned up his toes and died.

43
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:22,436
But not our Mick. No.

44
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:24,596
Hundreds of miles...

45
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,674
Snake-infested swamps...

46
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:34,475
On his hands and knees
he crawled right into Katherine.

47
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:39,234
Straight past the hospital
and into the first pub for a beer!

48
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:45,036
That story's getting better
every time you tell it, Wally!

49
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:53,594
We handle ourselves pretty well here.
But if you're talking legend...

50
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:07,351
Oh, my God!

51
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:23,954
Two beers, Ide... one for me,
one for me mate.

52
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:27,315
"One for your mate", you mad bugger!

53
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,270
Oh, hang on...

54
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:36,794
I'm sorry if that frightened you, Miss.
You see, it's stuffed.

55
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,912
Him and me both, Wal.

56
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,193
Michael J. Crocodile Dundee.

57
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:55,035
- Never-Never Safaris.
- Yes.

58
00:07:55,238 --> 00:08:00,266
Never go out with us. If you do,
you'll never come back. Right, Wal?

59
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:02,873
Sue Charlton, Newsday.

60
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,913
Yeah, I thought you might be.

61
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:16,835
Here, Wal. Mind Cyril for me while
I dance with this charming young lady.

62
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:34,234
Legend has it
a crocodile took half your leg off.

63
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:37,236
A slight exaggeration.

64
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:40,953
More like a love bite, really.

65
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:48,633
There you are, enough about me leg.
Let me tell you about the rest of me.

66
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:52,393
Up north in the Never-Never,
where the land is harsh and bare,

67
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,032
lives a mighty hunter
named Mick Dundee

68
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,109
who can dance like Fred Astaire.

69
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:59,878
Smooth, Shag, eh?

70
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,434
- What was the name of this clown?
- Mick Dundee.

71
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:06,431
The bloke that was grabbed
by a croc on the Rapid River.

72
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:11,837
- What was he doing up there?
- It's full of crocs! What do you think?

73
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:13,869
Just a bloody poacher, eh?

74
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:18,956
I want you to take me
where you were attacked.

75
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,594
Show me how you survived.

76
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:26,353
Just the two of us out there alone?
I got my reputation to think about.

77
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:31,586
Hey, Dundee! Where can a man shoot
a few crocs around here?

78
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:38,636
How would I know, Shit-For-Brains?

79
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:42,757
Just relax.

80
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:51,075
Every man and his dog in the joint
know you're nothing but a croc poacher.

81
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:06,953
Sorry, but I won't have anyone
using bad language in front of a lady.

82
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:08,631
Bad language?

83
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:12,671
Don't come back!

84
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:16,554
What was he saying
about you being a poacher?

85
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:19,636
He was just trying to get a bite.

86
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:25,515
- Donk, tonight's me lucky night.
- You want to have a hit at my guts?

87
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,512
Put your money on me, guys!

88
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:41,273
Come on, Mick.

89
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:57,156
Give him one of your kicks, Donk!

90
00:10:58,478 --> 00:11:01,276
I'm sorry, he's not normally like this.

91
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:04,515
I do apologise, it's just the drink.

92
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:08,114
You mean,
there's a serious side to him?

93
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:10,918
I can hardly wait.

94
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:26,432
Comfortable, Miss?

95
00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:30,597
- Wonderful country out here.
- We think so.

96
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:43,112
I hope you're not gonna be
the strong, silent type.

97
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:47,192
- Reluctant to talk about yourself?
- Nah, favourite subject.

98
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:50,037
- Why 'Crocodile'?
- Wal's idea.

99
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:54,436
He reckons it makes me more
colourful for the tourist business.

100
00:11:57,438 --> 00:12:00,157
- How old are you?
- Dunno.

101
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:03,077
- What year is this?
- You don't know?

102
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,954
Time doesn't mean much up here.
The Aborigines don't have calendars.

103
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:10,274
I was raised by the local tribe.

104
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:14,073
I asked one of the tribal elders
when I was born, and he said,

105
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:16,917
"In the summertime."

106
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:37,436
And is there a Mrs Crocodile Dundee?

107
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:43,076
I was sort of married once.
Nice girl, good cook. Big...

108
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:50,157
I went off on a Walkabout,
and when I came back, she'd gone.

109
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,314
- A 'Walkabout'?
- That's an Aboriginal habit.

110
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:59,234
It means to wander around
and discover new places.

111
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:02,592
- How long were you gone?
- Couple of months.

112
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,074
Try eighteen.

113
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,710
And she didn't wait? Strange girl.

114
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:12,395
Yeah.

115
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,394
Out of the way, dopey!

116
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:24,071
Jesus...

117
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:31,317
- That was amazing.
- Mind over matter.

118
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,514
Old bushman's trick.

119
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:34,076
All right, Miss, all ashore.

120
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:40,313
Now I'm gonna leave you
in Mick's capable hands,

121
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:45,154
and I'll meet you
at the Echo Billabong on Wednesday.

122
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:01,154
2.20. We'd better get started.

123
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:06,517
- 2.20?
- That's the way we do it in the bush.

124
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:12,987
Don't worry, he's the best bushman
in the territory. Best pupil I ever had.

125
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,117
- You ready, lady?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

126
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,153
- Right, well, till Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

127
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,834
- What's today, Wal?
- Monday.

128
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,151
Doesn't know... doesn't care.

129
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:41,434
Lucky bastard.

130
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,516
- You OK, lady?
- I'm fine.

131
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:01,593
It's only about another hour
to the river, but you being a sheila...

132
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:03,954
...it'll probably take two.

133
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:08,875
- Well, I'll just do the best I can.
- Yeah.

134
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:18,437
The water was running twenty foot
up the bank during the wet season.

135
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:30,676
Here's what's left of me boat.

136
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:45,594
Now you can see
where he sunk his teeth in.

137
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,918
- How big was it?
- Oh, sixteen, eighteen foot, maybe.

138
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:56,315
And you were out here
hunting crocodiles in that?

139
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,834
Nah, that's illegal. I was just fishing.

140
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:08,554
- How did you get away?
- Crocs don't like fresh meat.

141
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:14,355
He wasn't trying to eat me. He wanted
to take me down for a death roll.

142
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,837
See, a croc will grab you and take you
down to the bottom of the water

143
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,792
and roll you over and over
till you stop kicking.

144
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:26,910
Then he'll take you away
to his meat safe,

145
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:31,953
a rock ledge or log down
under the water and jam you under it,

146
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,758
tenderise you a bit, good eating.

147
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:40,836
He wasn't happy with his grip on me,
so he let go to get a better one.

148
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,871
- I talked him out of it.
- Talked?

149
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:57,674
And you were just out here fishing?

150
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:03,114
Well, barramundi is a bloody big fish.

151
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,314
It'll be getting dark soon.

152
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:09,914
I'll take you
to where I camped the first night.

153
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:36,075
- You married?
- Was once... to the original rebel.

154
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:39,793
- What happened?
- You name it, we marched.

155
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:43,513
Anti-nuke, Women's Lib,
Save the Whales...

156
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:46,795
He's probably marching right now
for the gay Nazis.

157
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,236
- Sounds like a prize ratbag.
- He meant well.

158
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:53,713
Haven't you ever
protested anything?

159
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:56,876
Sure, every time
I get thrown out of the pub.

160
00:19:57,118 --> 00:20:02,636
I'm serious. Where would you stand
on, say, the nuclear debate?

161
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:05,836
- What about the arms race?
- None of my business.

162
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:09,591
None of your business?
How can you say that?

163
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:12,075
It's everybody's business.

164
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,836
Got to have an opinion,
got to have a voice.

165
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:22,914
Who's gonna hear it out here?

166
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:26,673
OK, something closer to home.

167
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:33,117
The Aborigines, what about
their claims to get the land back?

168
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,317
Well, you see,
Aborigines don't own the land.

169
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:41,352
They belong to it.
It's like their mother.

170
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:48,397
See those rocks sticking up there.
Been standing there for 600 million years.

171
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,993
Still be there when you and I are gone.

172
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:53,957
So arguing over who owns them...

173
00:20:55,318 --> 00:21:00,346
...is like two fleas arguing over
who owns the dog they live on.

174
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:06,114
You see, Aborigines,
like all God's creatures,

175
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:10,834
they just want the right to roam
across the Earth and be left in peace.

176
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:18,114
It's that...

177
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:25,354
- Oh, it's a King Brown.
- Poisonous?

178
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:31,036
Oh, yeah, deadly. Not bad eating,
but they always give me gas.

179
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:34,793
Listen, are there any more
of those around?

180
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:41,073
Maybe the odd one late at night, but
stick close to me, you'll be all right.

181
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:05,353
You're probably right,
a man should have an opinion...

182
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:07,554
What?

183
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:11,391
Thought I heard something.

184
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,873
No, it's nothing. Goodnight.

185
00:22:40,718 --> 00:22:42,754
Mick?

186
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,594
It's only me.

187
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:22,073
Dangerous bastards.
It's those city cowboys.

188
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:26,516
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing, why?

189
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:30,677
Why? They're shooting
these poor kangaroos for fun!

190
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:37,235
Well, there's no law against that.

191
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:47,551
Keep your head down. Stay here.

192
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,514
I need a piss!

193
00:23:56,998 --> 00:24:00,035
- I need a piss!
- And a straighter rifle.

194
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,992
You're as useless
as tits on a bull, Duffy!

195
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:13,113
Shut up, you guys! Hey, Trevor!
Get the spotlight over here, man!

196
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:16,276
- The spotlight!
- Can't you see where you're aiming?

197
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:18,110
Shut up!

198
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:25,032
Not on me, you silly bugger,
on the bushes!

199
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,113
Look at this big cheeky bugger.

200
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:33,754
Hey! It's got a gun!

201
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,555
Shit!

202
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,754
Good one, Skippy.

203
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:01,234
Despite the rugged beauty of this land,

204
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:04,995
there's a sort
of strange emptiness about it.

205
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:08,074
A feeling of being so alone.

206
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:13,155
Yeah, but you're not alone.
I'm here, aren't I?

207
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:16,634
Yeah, but I think I know
how you must have felt.

208
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:20,075
Or, how I'd feel
if I were out here alone.

209
00:26:20,518 --> 00:26:22,429
You? Out here alone?

210
00:26:22,638 --> 00:26:28,235
That's a joke. A city girl like you.
You wouldn't last five minutes, love.

211
00:26:28,478 --> 00:26:31,436
This is a man's country out here.

212
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:37,235
That's right, I'm only a sheila.

213
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:50,434
We're heading for
that escarpment today, right?

214
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:53,715
OK, see you there this afternoon.

215
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,633
Hey! If you're gonna go,
take the gun with you.

216
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:04,117
If you get into trouble,
fire a couple of shots in the air.

217
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:17,472
That's the dangerous end.

218
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:29,274
So it is.

219
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:59,512
It's all right, it's over.

220
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:09,711
I got you, I got you.

221
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:18,434
Is it dead?

222
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:32,474
If it isn't, I'll have a job
skinning the bastard.

223
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:51,276
You were right.
Definitely no place for a city girl.

224
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:56,797
From what Wal's told me, living
in the city can be just as dangerous.

225
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,434
- Haven't you ever lived in a city?
- Never been to a city.

226
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:02,555
- You're kidding?
- No.

227
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:08,116
Cities are crowded, right? If I went and
lived in a city, I'd only make it worse.

228
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:10,314
Here, try this.

229
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,153
- Do you want me to have a look?
- It's just a scratch.

230
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:23,557
A scratch can turn septic out here.
Give us a look. No, it's all right.

231
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:28,674
Now what?

232
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:36,515
Oh, Christ! It's like living
with Davy Crockett.

233
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:43,514
Mick?

234
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:48,752
Mick?

235
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:03,717
Oh, Mick! You frightened shit
out of me!

236
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:09,675
So I ought to. Sneaking up on a man
when he's rendering first aid to a lady!

237
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:12,352
Is that what you were doing?

238
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:20,106
It's all right, it's a mate of mine,
Neville Bell. Sue Charlton.

239
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:25,513
What are you doing
wandering round here?

240
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:29,275
I'm on my way to a corroboree
at the Jabba. A bloody drag.

241
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:33,553
But still, my dad'll get angry
if I don't show up.

242
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:38,593
Nev's a real city boy,
but his dad's a tribal elder.

243
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,997
Oh, no, you can't take my photograph.

244
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:45,395
I'm sorry, you believe
it'll take your spirit away?

245
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:47,873
No, you got a lens cap on!

246
00:33:51,838 --> 00:33:55,194
Crikey! Mick, I'd better get going.

247
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,834
- Nice to meet you, Sue.
- Bye, Nev.

248
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:03,516
- I'll catch up with you, Nev.
- What's happening?

249
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,473
I'd better go with Nev
and see the Pintinjarra.

250
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,111
Can I come?

251
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:12,675
No way. Women are
strictly taboo at these turnouts.

252
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:17,714
How does he find his way in the dark?

253
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:23,476
He thinks his way. A lot of people
believe that they're telepathic.

254
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:26,351
Oh, I hate the bush!

255
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:53,352
How did you know?

256
00:35:56,478 --> 00:35:58,753
Are you telepathic?

257
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:02,394
Nah. Common sense.

258
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:04,793
You're a woman, a reporter,

259
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:08,035
that makes you
the biggest busybody in the world.

260
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:11,874
I can live with that.

261
00:36:15,198 --> 00:36:18,156
That croc was gonna eat me alive.

262
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:22,557
I wouldn't hold that against him.

263
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:26,433
Same thought crossed my mind
once or twice.

264
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:33,950
Goodnight, Mick.

265
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:40,156
It took me a week to crawl this far.

266
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,037
I thought I was a goner.
I said to myself,

267
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:47,914
"Old son, find yourself a comfortable
spot and lay down and die."

268
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:50,871
- Weren't you afraid?
- Of dying? Nah!

269
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:56,027
I read the Bible once. You know
God and Jesus and all them apostles?

270
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:58,872
They were all fishermen, just like me.

271
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:02,912
Yeah, straight to heaven
for Mick Dundee.

272
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:09,917
Yep... Me and God, we'd be mates.

273
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,156
This is Echo Lake.

274
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:27,395
I reckon this place saved my life.

275
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:34,633
That's mineral water.
It means no crocs.

276
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,312
- Plenty of tucker here.
- Tucker?

277
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:40,757
- Food. You hungry?
- Starving.

278
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,232
I'll get lunch.

279
00:37:51,638 --> 00:37:54,675
How do you like your goanna?
Medium? Well done?

280
00:37:54,878 --> 00:37:58,837
- You don't expect me to eat that?
- It's great. Try some yams.

281
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:04,914
Try the grubs and the sugar ants.
Bite the end off, they're really sweet.

282
00:38:09,598 --> 00:38:12,032
- Aren't you having any?
- Me?

283
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,152
Oh, well, you can live on it...

284
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,712
...but it tastes like shit.

285
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,556
Mick? Why don't you
come back with me?

286
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,114
What for?

287
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:38,473
It would make a great wrap
to the story. You in New York City.

288
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:44,237
Oh. For a minute I thought
you were making a pass at me.

289
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:46,554
Well, I might have been.

290
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:51,556
Would you mind?

291
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,190
Bloody Wally.

292
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:23,914
He's only been here a dozen times.
He's probably lost.

293
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:44,514
Did you...?

294
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:48,515
You got wind or something, Wal?

295
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:57,992
I want Mick to come back
to New York with me.

296
00:40:58,198 --> 00:41:01,554
Mick? In a big city? No chance.

297
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:03,754
The paper would pay.

298
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:08,757
Well... A man should
broaden his horizons.

299
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:17,396
Everything OK?

300
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:20,032
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no worries.

301
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:40,072
Jesus Christ!

302
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:06,314
Sue!

303
00:42:07,038 --> 00:42:09,393
Sue! Sue...

304
00:42:09,998 --> 00:42:11,954
G'day, mate!

305
00:42:15,558 --> 00:42:18,595
You look absolutely stunning.

306
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:23,675
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

307
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:25,834
Let me get this.

308
00:42:26,078 --> 00:42:29,593
Where's the man
from the backwoods?

309
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:32,073
We got separated at customs.

310
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,277
He almost started a riot when they
wanted to look through his suitcase.

311
00:42:36,518 --> 00:42:38,474
There he is!

312
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:41,636
So that's Jungle Jim?

313
00:43:12,878 --> 00:43:16,837
New York City, Mr Dundee.
Home to seven million people.

314
00:43:17,038 --> 00:43:21,873
Incredible. Imagine seven million
people all wanting to live together.

315
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:27,314
Yeah, New York must be
the friendliest place on Earth.

316
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,232
G'day!

317
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:45,633
Mick Dundee from Australia.
How are you?

318
00:43:45,878 --> 00:43:48,915
- I'm fine, how are you?
- Good.

319
00:43:49,158 --> 00:43:53,197
I'm in town for a couple of days.
Probably see you around.

320
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:54,831
Bye.

321
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:19,394
Thank you, Gus.

322
00:44:22,638 --> 00:44:25,550
You'll take care of the luggage?

323
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:31,355
That's it.

324
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:36,795
- Thanks for the lift, mate.
- No problem.

325
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:41,554
- What tribe are you, Gus?
- Tribe? Man, I ain't from no tribe.

326
00:44:42,038 --> 00:44:45,235
- You're a black fella, aren't you?
- Last time I looked.

327
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:51,517
No one in our tribe's got a flash car
like this. You must be doing all right.

328
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,433
Do you want to eat
somewhere special tonight?

329
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:06,996
- I thought Tacano's would be nice.
- Tacano's? 7.30?

330
00:45:07,198 --> 00:45:09,917
- Bye.
- OK. Table for three.

331
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:40,794
Sir?

332
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:44,314
No worries.

333
00:45:59,438 --> 00:46:02,111
Well, what do you think?

334
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,355
It's a bit rough, but I'll manage.

335
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:09,634
Hey, how many of us
are staying here?

336
00:46:09,878 --> 00:46:13,837
Just you. I've got
my own apartment downtown.

337
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,996
Sorry, Mick Dundee.
I didn't catch the name.

338
00:46:26,198 --> 00:46:28,473
- Angelo.
- Pleased to meet you, Angelo.

339
00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:32,034
I got it. Here you go.

340
00:46:35,638 --> 00:46:40,837
- Got to pay for the room in advance?
- You're in my town now, trust me.

341
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:49,432
Can I get the direct
dialling code for Australia?

342
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:59,313
You should be comfortable.
There's a TV if you get bored.

343
00:46:59,558 --> 00:47:04,313
Ah, TV. Yeah, I saw that
at Darkie Johnson's place years ago.

344
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,831
Yep, that's what I saw.

345
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:18,993
Right. OK, thanks.

346
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:24,232
I'm writing down Wally's number
and my office number.

347
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:27,754
Hey, Sue, come here, look at this!

348
00:47:33,078 --> 00:47:35,911
Some nitwit's put two dunnies in here.

349
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:37,836
One dunny, one bidet.

350
00:47:39,638 --> 00:47:41,435
Bidday?

351
00:47:41,638 --> 00:47:45,677
It's for... after you... you know...

352
00:47:49,798 --> 00:47:51,754
You figure it out.

353
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:55,274
See you at seven.

354
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:34,871
For washing your backside, right?

355
00:48:51,558 --> 00:48:52,832
G'day.

356
00:49:06,478 --> 00:49:07,752
G'day.

357
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:10,874
G'day. G'day.

358
00:49:19,198 --> 00:49:20,836
- G'day.
- Hello.

359
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:22,832
G'day.

360
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,636
I'm sorry.

361
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:47,150
G'day.

362
00:49:48,918 --> 00:49:50,192
Shit!

363
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:58,751
- Take it easy, Mick.
- Thanks, mate.

364
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:04,751
- G'day.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:51:17,278 --> 00:51:20,315
Good evening. Follow me, please.

366
00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:25,830
Hello.

367
00:51:26,038 --> 00:51:28,996
Sorry we're late. Been waiting long?

368
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:32,713
I arrived early,
eager to spend time with my girl.

369
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:37,673
So, what are we drinking? Two vodka
martinis, and what's yours, Crocodile?

370
00:51:37,918 --> 00:51:41,354
Yeah, I'll have two of those,
and a beer, thanks.

371
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,955
Could you send them through
to our table, man?

372
00:51:48,678 --> 00:51:52,034
- You have been here a while.
- Let's eat.

373
00:51:55,078 --> 00:52:01,074
This'll be quite a novelty for you, eating
something without having to kill it first.

374
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,435
Shall we?
Ah, Roberto!

375
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:09,798
Good evening, Mr Mason, I can see
you've got some friends. Follow me.

376
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:16,434
Thank you.

377
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:27,395
I had almost forgotten
what a sexy-Iooking lady you are.

378
00:52:27,638 --> 00:52:32,154
I'm gonna have to find a way
of keeping you in town.

379
00:52:35,438 --> 00:52:41,388
- You two should really be alone.
- Sorry, it's been six weeks.

380
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:45,597
- That's all the more reason...
- It's your first night in New York.

381
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,354
- Richard and I want you with us.
- Right, absolutely.

382
00:52:50,598 --> 00:52:54,432
New York is no place
for a... country gent.

383
00:52:55,478 --> 00:53:01,428
Ain't no crocodiles out there, but a fast
movin' Chevy sure make a mess of you.

384
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:09,875
What's your game?

385
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:14,193
Great. I'm starving.

386
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:20,115
Grazie, Roberto.
?stato piacere un rivederti.

387
00:53:20,358 --> 00:53:23,111
Bravissimo, lei parla
molto bene Italiano.

388
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:28,914
Thank you. Perhaps I should order
for all of us, all right?

389
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:33,834
I don't imagine that they have any...
kangaroo steak or possum grits!

390
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:37,917
Don't worry, Mick can make
a gourmet meal out of anything.

391
00:53:38,478 --> 00:53:41,072
Even medium rare goanna.

392
00:53:41,278 --> 00:53:45,317
It was great, wasn't it?
And what about the yams?

393
00:53:45,518 --> 00:53:47,634
They were great.

394
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:51,996
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

395
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:57,674
So, as he's our guest, perhaps
he'd like to order for all of us.

396
00:53:57,878 --> 00:54:00,711
Wait a minute, I'll do that.

397
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,196
No, it's all right. I'll have a lash.

398
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:11,873
- Italian, eh?
- Yes.

399
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:25,034
I dunno what you call it, but I like
the look of what that fat sheila's eating.

400
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:31,793
Richard!

401
00:54:32,038 --> 00:54:33,551
He OK?

402
00:54:34,678 --> 00:54:37,192
Can't handle his drink, poor fella.

403
00:54:48,558 --> 00:54:52,153
He said you hit him. You're not
in the pub in Walkabout Creek now.

404
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:56,155
- He was being a pain.
- That's beside the point.

405
00:54:57,198 --> 00:55:01,077
- You're not serious about this lemon?
- Butt out, Dundee!

406
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:05,556
He had too much to drink.
Richard is warm, caring and I love him.

407
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:08,995
Excuse me.
I think I'm gonna throw up.

408
00:55:09,238 --> 00:55:10,512
God!

409
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:32,878
- You want a hand?
- No, I can handle it.

410
00:55:33,078 --> 00:55:35,034
I'm fine.

411
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:41,597
We've got a busy day tomorrow,
so get some sleep. I'll pick you up early.

412
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:43,754
- Goodnight.
- Night.

413
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:55,312
- Take me to the boozer.
- Boozer? Don't know that one.

414
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:59,435
Pub, somewhere to get a drink.
Want to join me?

415
00:55:59,678 --> 00:56:03,637
- I just finished my shift, why not?
- Fancy a drink, do you?

416
00:56:03,878 --> 00:56:09,396
You kiddin'? I'm Italian,
I'd drink you under the table any day.

417
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:11,953
That could be interesting.

418
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:23,314
I'm not putting down
your black widow spider.

419
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:29,793
But the funnel web spider can kill in
eight seconds, just by looking at you.

420
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:35,157
But the real danger down there is
the sharks, the big ones, like 'Jaws'.

421
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:39,795
I caught one 3 weeks ago, opened it,
you know what we found inside it?

422
00:56:40,038 --> 00:56:43,394
Three Filipino fishermen...
still in their boat!

423
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:46,795
Buzzy! Come on over,
meet this guy from Australia!

424
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,793
Hey, my man, what's happening?

425
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:53,956
- Where?
- What's going down, bro?

426
00:56:55,038 --> 00:56:58,075
Going down?
Just blowing the froth off a couple.

427
00:56:59,118 --> 00:57:01,678
All right! Hang loose, my man!

428
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:06,997
- Flat out like a lizard drinking.
- Say what?

429
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:09,274
What?

430
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,911
- He's cool!
- Yeah. I'm cool. I'm cool.

431
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:29,432
- All right!
- All right!

432
00:57:31,678 --> 00:57:35,717
He's a nice fella.
Here's my little Italian mate Danny!

433
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:39,314
Just in time to buy another round.
What are you drinking, Gwendoline?

434
00:57:39,518 --> 00:57:44,194
No more for me, thanks, Mick,
I must be getting on home.

435
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:47,071
Where's home, sweetie?

436
00:57:47,278 --> 00:57:50,953
Just around the corner. I have a little
place where I live all by my Ionesome.

437
00:57:51,198 --> 00:57:54,713
- Not now.
- Most of the time, that is.

438
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:58,075
Must get a bit Ionely?

439
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,357
- Hanker for a bit of male company?
- Do I ever.

440
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,992
Excuse me, Gwendoline.
Don't go away, love.

441
00:58:10,438 --> 00:58:15,637
I've been trying to tell you all night,
that girl... she's a guy!

442
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,432
A man dressed up as a girl!

443
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:22,834
- Nah, nah...
- A fag, for Chrissakes!

444
00:58:26,438 --> 00:58:28,394
I swear.

445
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:47,072
Hey! That was a guy!
A guy dressed up like a sheila!

446
00:58:47,278 --> 00:58:52,113
Look at that! Hey, you all knew,
you pack of bastards.

447
00:59:00,998 --> 00:59:04,195
- Where the hell did I leave the cab?
- Dunno.

448
00:59:04,398 --> 00:59:08,073
You wait here
till I go look for it, Mick.

449
00:59:31,478 --> 00:59:34,675
G'day, girls.
Mick Dundee from Australia.

450
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:41,596
- Lookin' for a good time, honey?
- Always lookin' for a good time.

451
00:59:47,118 --> 00:59:50,872
Either of you ladies attached
or married or anything?

452
00:59:52,398 --> 00:59:55,117
No, we're both single ladies.

453
00:59:59,598 --> 01:00:02,476
This is Karla, I'm Simone.
Where you from, honey?

454
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:07,197
From Walkabout Creek
in the Northern Territory.

455
01:00:07,398 --> 01:00:10,435
You probably don't know where that is.

456
01:00:10,638 --> 01:00:15,473
Hey! I do. You're the guy
I've been reading about in the paper.

457
01:00:15,718 --> 01:00:18,551
The crocodile man,
I've been reading about him.

458
01:00:18,758 --> 01:00:24,515
He's like a regular Tarzan...
wrestles crocodiles, eats snakes...

459
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:28,716
Is this your first trip to New York?

460
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,836
- First trip anywhere.
- Well, hell!

461
01:00:35,038 --> 01:00:37,871
We might just have
to give you one for free.

462
01:00:39,558 --> 01:00:41,514
Yeah...

463
01:00:42,918 --> 01:00:45,034
One what?

464
01:00:53,198 --> 01:00:57,157
We could take in a movie
or go to a dance or...

465
01:00:57,398 --> 01:01:02,392
Hey, girls, girls! Are we working tonight
or are we socialising?

466
01:01:02,638 --> 01:01:04,674
Hey, pal!

467
01:01:05,598 --> 01:01:08,795
I was just talking to the ladies,
and making a bit of progress.

468
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:14,393
Are you gonna talk all night
or are you gonna screw one of them?

469
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:24,557
Sorry, but if you stand around
out the front of a place like this,

470
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,313
you're gonna hear
that kind of bad language.

471
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,112
Nice chatting to you, ladies.

472
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:35,072
Danny, you're in no condition
to drive. Hop in, mate!

473
01:01:37,518 --> 01:01:39,554
That's why you have
so many accidents here.

474
01:01:39,798 --> 01:01:44,235
The steering wheel's
on the wrong side of the car!

475
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:54,833
Get out of the way, dopey!

476
01:01:56,118 --> 01:02:00,396
Get on the right side of the road,
you pelican!

477
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:13,792
If I give my heart to you

478
01:02:14,878 --> 01:02:17,551
Then I'll have none
And you'll have two

479
01:02:42,398 --> 01:02:43,831
Señor Mick?

480
01:02:45,238 --> 01:02:46,876
The towels for señor Mick.

481
01:02:47,078 --> 01:02:48,511
Is that you, Rosita?

482
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:52,032
Leave the spare towels on the bed.

483
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:54,792
Mucho gracias, love!

484
01:02:56,158 --> 01:02:58,592
Si, señor Mick.

485
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:13,831
Strewth!

486
01:03:14,038 --> 01:03:17,075
Listen, Rosita...

487
01:03:18,078 --> 01:03:21,593
I was only being friendly.
You know, I didn't mean...

488
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:24,477
Your towels, señor Mick.

489
01:03:32,998 --> 01:03:36,513
For a minute there, room service
took on a whole new meaning.

490
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:08,954
One dog, please.

491
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:15,715
With chilli, onions,
sauerkraut and some peppers.

492
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,913
- There you go.
- You eat that?

493
01:04:24,638 --> 01:04:29,917
Well, you know, you can live on it.
But it tastes like shit!

494
01:04:56,638 --> 01:04:58,310
My bag!

495
01:04:59,238 --> 01:05:01,752
Thief! Thief!

496
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:49,352
Hey, Mick! How you doin', baby?

497
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:51,753
- It's me, Simone!
- Oh, yeah, Simone...

498
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,836
- Having a good time?
- As always.

499
01:05:57,038 --> 01:05:59,074
Nice girl.

500
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:02,236
Thoughtful, too,
dancing with her father.

501
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:07,472
We're gonna have to overcome
this country boy shyness, Dundee.

502
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:10,596
There's someone I want you to meet.

503
01:06:13,438 --> 01:06:17,636
Sue, darling, you're back,
how wonderful!

504
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:21,433
- Fran, how are you?
- Couldn't be better.

505
01:06:21,638 --> 01:06:24,596
Tell me, who's the new man?

506
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:28,433
This is the man I'm writing about,
Mick Dundee.

507
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:32,430
Something the matter, darling?

508
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:36,394
Pleased to meet you.

509
01:06:36,638 --> 01:06:41,917
- It's OK, he's Australian.
- Maybe I'd better go there someday.

510
01:06:43,718 --> 01:06:47,472
Darling, I'm so glad you could come!
Excuse me.

511
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:54,952
Just making sure.

512
01:06:55,158 --> 01:06:57,513
Right. I'll get us a drink.

513
01:07:37,238 --> 01:07:39,274
It's good shit.

514
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:35,075
- What's up, pal? Got a blocked nose?
- Blocked nose, right.

515
01:08:35,318 --> 01:08:40,517
- There's a better way of doing it.
- Better way?

516
01:08:40,718 --> 01:08:42,674
Yep.

517
01:08:44,118 --> 01:08:48,475
It's the way we do it back home.
It really fixes us up.

518
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,752
Now, boiling water...

519
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:05,672
Get the steam going...
Get your face right over that.

520
01:09:05,878 --> 01:09:09,314
The old tea towel over your skull...

521
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:12,715
Put your head down onto that.
Breathe it in real deep.

522
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:17,593
Ten minutes of that,
you'll be clear as a bell, no worries.

523
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:20,551
Get into it.

524
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:29,831
Get into it!

525
01:09:32,998 --> 01:09:38,277
You know, that was probably a couple
of hundred dollars worth of cocaine.

526
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:43,074
- What's that?
- It's a drug. You sniff it.

527
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:46,111
- What for?
- Well, to get a buzz.

528
01:09:49,278 --> 01:09:53,157
What, like shovin' a blowfly
up your nose?

529
01:10:04,638 --> 01:10:08,233
Got the photo, Mick! I look great!

530
01:10:10,278 --> 01:10:11,916
Ida sends love.

531
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:15,394
Wait a minute, Donk wants
to have a word with you.

532
01:10:15,598 --> 01:10:17,953
Mick! Get stuffed!

533
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:22,674
How are you getting on
with the New Yorkers?

534
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:27,355
Bonzer people.
Friendly, full of beans, but a bit weird.

535
01:10:27,918 --> 01:10:32,434
That's the joys of travelling.
When are you coming home?

536
01:10:32,638 --> 01:10:35,391
If you can manage,
I'd like to stay a while.

537
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:38,352
Oh, yeah! No troubles at all.

538
01:10:38,558 --> 01:10:42,153
Wouldn't have anything to do
with a certain lady writer, would it?

539
01:10:43,278 --> 01:10:46,315
To start with,
she's a better kisser than Donk.

540
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:50,992
You little beauty! Keep in touch.

541
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:53,792
No worries, Wal!

542
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,790
Come on, what did he say?

543
01:10:57,998 --> 01:11:02,753
He wants to stay there a while longer,
wants me to take care of things here.

544
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:17,992
- You got a light, buddy?
- Yeah, sure, kid.

545
01:11:18,198 --> 01:11:19,950
There you go.

546
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:22,433
And your wallet!

547
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,873
Mick, give him your wallet.

548
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:27,957
- What for?
- He's got a knife.

549
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:32,153
That's not a knife.

550
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:36,434
That's a knife.

551
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,156
Shit!

552
01:11:48,918 --> 01:11:51,478
Just kids having fun. Are you all right?

553
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:54,916
I'm always all right
when I'm with you, Dundee.

554
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:57,473
God, that sounds corny!

555
01:11:57,718 --> 01:12:01,757
Why do you always make me feel
like Jane in the Tarzan comic?

556
01:12:46,918 --> 01:12:49,034
That's what we ran
while you were away.

557
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:53,112
Sorry, I can't seem
to get my mind in gear.

558
01:12:56,678 --> 01:12:57,952
Sue...

559
01:12:59,038 --> 01:13:02,713
When you were away,
I did some thinking.

560
01:13:04,598 --> 01:13:07,192
It's time I made some concrete plans.

561
01:13:07,398 --> 01:13:11,073
Are you building a freeway or proposing
to the finest catch in New York State?

562
01:13:11,518 --> 01:13:14,032
Hello, young lady.
Been reading your articles.

563
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:18,356
Seems you've been all over the world
enjoying yourself at our expense.

564
01:13:18,558 --> 01:13:22,597
I'd like to think
you're getting your money's worth.

565
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:24,237
Hi, Dad.

566
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:27,271
You got a kiss for the old man?

567
01:13:31,798 --> 01:13:34,153
Thank God you're home safe.

568
01:13:34,798 --> 01:13:37,471
- Have you told Sue about Sunday?
- I was just about to.

569
01:13:37,678 --> 01:13:40,192
You're coming to the house
for a welcome home dinner.

570
01:13:40,398 --> 01:13:45,074
But now I want Richard to explain
how he runs this paper better than I do.

571
01:13:45,278 --> 01:13:48,873
By all means, bring along
this Crocodile Dundee.

572
01:13:49,118 --> 01:13:51,757
Him I've got to meet.

573
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:27,315
Thought you said
your dad sells newspapers.

574
01:14:27,558 --> 01:14:29,753
He sells a lot of newspapers.

575
01:14:51,358 --> 01:14:53,314
Thank you, Gus.

576
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:01,275
Oh, hell, the dogs are out.

577
01:15:01,518 --> 01:15:02,792
Mick?

578
01:15:47,758 --> 01:15:50,716
Nice to see you again, Miss.
Mr Mason.

579
01:15:50,918 --> 01:15:55,355
Nice to see you looking so fit and well.
Simpson, Mr Dundee.

580
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,149
Nice to meet you, Simo.

581
01:16:01,638 --> 01:16:04,152
- Call me Mick.
- Mick!

582
01:16:05,398 --> 01:16:09,835
Your father's expecting you.
He's waiting in the lounge.

583
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:22,594
Excuse me.

584
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:26,792
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi, Dad.

585
01:16:27,038 --> 01:16:29,552
- Richard!
- Sam, good to see you.

586
01:16:29,758 --> 01:16:32,352
And this, of course, is Mr Dundee.

587
01:16:32,558 --> 01:16:36,676
I believe I am deeply in your debt
for saving my daughter's life.

588
01:16:36,878 --> 01:16:40,712
Buy me a cold beer
and we'll call it quits.

589
01:16:40,918 --> 01:16:44,433
- Nice joint you got here.
- It keeps the rain off our heads.

590
01:16:44,678 --> 01:16:49,706
Come, I want you to meet
some people. A drink for Mr Dundee.

591
01:16:52,478 --> 01:16:54,594
- My Dawn.
- How are you?

592
01:16:54,798 --> 01:16:56,834
Dorothy and Wendell Wainwright.
From Australia.

593
01:16:57,518 --> 01:17:01,272
- Nice to meet you, Wendell.
- Mike, have a drink.

594
01:17:01,478 --> 01:17:04,276
Are you involved in cattle,
Mr Dundee?

595
01:17:04,478 --> 01:17:07,675
- Yeah, mostly buffaloes.
- Do you breed them?

596
01:17:07,878 --> 01:17:11,996
- No, I just toss 'em.
- And how are you finding New York?

597
01:17:12,198 --> 01:17:17,955
A bit of a lunatic asylum, eh?
That's why I love it, 'cause I fit right in.

598
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:22,476
If you'll excuse me, I'd like Mick
to say hello to Senator Manly.

599
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:25,915
- It was nice meeting you.
- See you later.

600
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,195
- Seems like a personable fellow.
- What a strange...

601
01:17:29,438 --> 01:17:30,837
Nice people.

602
01:17:31,038 --> 01:17:34,713
Dorothy's fine now,
but she used to be really uptight.

603
01:17:34,918 --> 01:17:38,877
- What happened?
- She found a wonderful shrink.

604
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:41,074
Psychiatrist.

605
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:47,558
I shouldn't have made that crack
about the lunatic asylum.

606
01:17:47,798 --> 01:17:51,711
- I didn't know she was nuts.
- Of course she's not nuts!

607
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:54,830
People go to a psychiatrist
to talk about their problems.

608
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:58,792
She just needed to unload them.
Bring them out in the open.

609
01:17:59,038 --> 01:18:01,074
Hasn't she got any mates?

610
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:04,953
You're right. Guess we could
all use more mates.

611
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:08,076
Suppose you don't have any shrinks
at Walkabout Creek?

612
01:18:08,278 --> 01:18:10,951
Back there, if you've got a problem,
you tell Wally.

613
01:18:11,158 --> 01:18:15,071
He tells everyone in town, brings it out
in the open, no more problem.

614
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,873
- I didn't think you could make it!
- Wendell, wonderful to see you.

615
01:18:20,078 --> 01:18:23,673
- I don't believe I know your daughter.
- Oh, stop it!

616
01:18:33,998 --> 01:18:37,354
Ladies and gentlemen! Friends!

617
01:18:37,598 --> 01:18:39,793
Welcome home, Sue!

618
01:18:44,078 --> 01:18:47,195
As you can see,
we're all glad to have you back.

619
01:18:47,398 --> 01:18:49,593
Of course, no one more than I.

620
01:18:49,838 --> 01:18:52,557
I guess everyone in this room...

621
01:18:52,758 --> 01:18:57,274
...knows how this beautiful lady and I
feel about each other.

622
01:18:57,478 --> 01:18:59,673
Sue's come back to us.

623
01:18:59,878 --> 01:19:02,517
Delivered literally
out of the jaws of death

624
01:19:02,718 --> 01:19:06,836
by our new-found friend,
Mr Michael J. Dundee.

625
01:19:07,878 --> 01:19:10,517
A man to whom I am doubly indebted.

626
01:19:10,718 --> 01:19:13,073
Not only did he bring back
to me the woman that I love,

627
01:19:13,318 --> 01:19:16,913
but he increased
the paper's circulation in the process!

628
01:19:18,118 --> 01:19:22,157
Sam said to me earlier,
"You're her editor!"

629
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:25,714
"Can't you stop her from taking
these dangerous assignments?"

630
01:19:25,918 --> 01:19:30,355
Obviously I have not had much
success influencing her as her editor.

631
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:34,511
Perhaps I'll have more success
as her husband.

632
01:19:34,718 --> 01:19:37,755
- If she'll have me.
- Oh, Richard!

633
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:04,593
- Congratulations.
- Couldn't be happier, Senator.

634
01:20:05,638 --> 01:20:07,913
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.

635
01:20:28,038 --> 01:20:31,235
I'll get in the back, Gus.

636
01:20:47,118 --> 01:20:49,473
To the hotel, Mick?

637
01:20:49,718 --> 01:20:52,152
Yeah, by way of a liquor store.

638
01:20:57,278 --> 01:21:00,111
For medicinal purposes.

639
01:21:01,798 --> 01:21:03,595
Thanks, mate.

640
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:26,752
Hey! Take care now!

641
01:21:46,758 --> 01:21:48,157
Hey, buddy!

642
01:21:51,318 --> 01:21:55,675
- Get it into you, Pop.
- God bless you. You saved my life.

643
01:22:05,998 --> 01:22:07,954
Hey, Simone!

644
01:22:12,918 --> 01:22:17,753
- You want some action?
- Thought you were somebody else.

645
01:22:20,078 --> 01:22:25,198
Well, if it ain't the man who don't like
bad fuckin' language in front of ladies.

646
01:22:25,758 --> 01:22:30,673
What's the matter, Aussie boy?
You gonna hop away like a kangaroo?

647
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,551
I think it's time for a little tap dancing.

648
01:23:21,998 --> 01:23:23,954
You OK, Mick?

649
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:29,636
Oh, yeah, Gus, no worries.
I was just getting on top of them.

650
01:23:39,758 --> 01:23:42,636
You sure you're not Pintinjarra tribe?

651
01:23:42,838 --> 01:23:45,193
No, man, Harlem Warlords!

652
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:47,872
I knew you were tribal.

653
01:23:55,718 --> 01:23:57,754
Mick Dundee's room, please.

654
01:24:12,598 --> 01:24:14,395
Sorry, he's still not answering.

655
01:24:14,598 --> 01:24:17,476
He called down to say
he was checking out today.

656
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:21,956
- We're gonna miss him around here.
- Thanks.

657
01:24:30,918 --> 01:24:32,874
Thank you, sir.

658
01:24:40,838 --> 01:24:42,874
G'day, Irving, how are you?

659
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,911
- I wouldn't be dead for dollars.
- Close.

660
01:24:46,118 --> 01:24:49,076
Are you leaving us, Mick?
You going back home?

661
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,274
No, I thought I'd go Walkabout.

662
01:24:53,078 --> 01:24:55,194
Wander around
and take a look at America.

663
01:24:56,078 --> 01:24:59,673
- For how long?
- Long as it takes.

664
01:24:59,878 --> 01:25:05,077
- What's the quickest way out of town?
- There's a subway two blocks that way.

665
01:25:05,278 --> 01:25:09,476
- It'll take you to Grand Central Station.
- That'll do.

666
01:25:09,678 --> 01:25:14,593
- Have a nice day, Oiving.
- No worries, mate.

667
01:25:42,398 --> 01:25:43,672
Morning, Miss.

668
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:47,071
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

669
01:25:47,278 --> 01:25:49,314
No, but it'll come to me.

670
01:25:49,518 --> 01:25:53,193
If you're looking for Crocodile Mick,
he's gone Walkabout.

671
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,197
- You don't know where?
- He's headed for the subway.

672
01:25:58,398 --> 01:26:00,229
You'd better hurry.

673
01:26:00,438 --> 01:26:02,315
Mind this for me.

674
01:26:10,518 --> 01:26:11,792
Oh, Christ!

675
01:27:29,038 --> 01:27:31,313
Hey, lady, where you goin'?

676
01:27:31,558 --> 01:27:35,073
If you want to play,
why don't you play with me?

677
01:27:40,278 --> 01:27:43,395
Mick! Mick Dundee!

678
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:47,472
What's up, lady?

679
01:27:48,278 --> 01:27:51,475
I got to talk to that man
down there in the black hat.

680
01:27:55,758 --> 01:27:57,430
Hey!

681
01:28:00,878 --> 01:28:04,791
The lady here wants to talk
to the guy in the black hat!

682
01:28:05,878 --> 01:28:08,073
Hey, fella!

683
01:28:08,318 --> 01:28:10,115
You in the hat!

684
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:13,515
The lady down the end
wants to see you!

685
01:28:14,518 --> 01:28:16,554
What does she want?

686
01:28:17,278 --> 01:28:20,395
- What does she want?
- What do you want?

687
01:28:22,398 --> 01:28:24,832
Tell him not to leave.

688
01:28:25,078 --> 01:28:27,433
I'm not gonna marry Richard.

689
01:28:30,358 --> 01:28:33,953
Tell him, don't leave.
She's not gonna marry Richard!

690
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:39,434
Don't leave.
I'm not gonna marry Richard.

691
01:28:41,678 --> 01:28:45,796
- Why not?
- I don't know. Why not?

692
01:28:46,998 --> 01:28:49,114
Why not?

693
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:54,636
Tell him I love him. I love you!

694
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:58,194
I love you!

695
01:29:00,078 --> 01:29:02,034
I love you! I love...

696
01:29:03,598 --> 01:29:06,396
- She loves me.
- Well?

697
01:29:07,638 --> 01:29:10,516
Tell her I...
I'll tell her myself, I'm coming through!

698
01:29:11,598 --> 01:29:14,271
- He's coming through!
- He's coming through!

699
01:29:19,078 --> 01:29:21,433
It's too crowded here,
we're jammed in like sheep.

700
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:24,109
Up, up, up...

701
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:20,995
