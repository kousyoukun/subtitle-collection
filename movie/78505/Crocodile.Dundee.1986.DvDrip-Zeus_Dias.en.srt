Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

2
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,472
Sue, don't misunderstand me, please.

3
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:36,914
I'm not complaining
about your work.

4
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,795
I have your latest piece,
and it's terrific.

5
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:42,356
But you were
due back yesterday.

6
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:45,717
But, Richard, there's one more
story I have to do.

7
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:47,638
There's always
one more story.

8
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:49,680
No, but listen to this.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,601
Last month this guy
in the Northern Territory

10
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,521
was attacked by a crocodile.

11
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,441
It bit his leg off,

12
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:59,242
left him to die
100 miles from nowhere.

13
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:01,884
A week later,
he crawls away and disappears.

14
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:03,405
No interviews, no pictures.

15
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:04,365
So?

16
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:05,805
I tracked him down.

17
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:07,726
He runs a safari business

18
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,047
out of somewhere
called Walkabout Creek.

19
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,208
And his name-

20
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:13,688
Get this-

21
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:17,291
Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee.

22
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,211
Even if it's for real,

23
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,571
it could take weeks
to nail him down.

24
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,692
Trust me.

25
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,172
I made arrangements
to meet him.

26
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:29,015
I've got a chopper meeting
the plane at Darwin tonight.

27
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,935
Well...

28
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,376
okay.

29
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,296
I really miss you, darling.

30
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:35,577
I miss you, too.

31
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:37,018
Take care now.

32
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,058
Don't worry.
I'm a New Yorker.

33
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,500
Hi. Walter Reilly,
Never- Never Safaris.

34
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,063
I'm Mr. Dundee's
business partner.

35
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,983
Nice meeting you, Mr. Reilly.

36
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:34,024
Oh, please, call me Walter.

37
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,464
We're pretty informal in the bush.

38
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:46,548
No, uh... Let me.

39
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,390
There you go.

40
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,910
You all right?

41
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,031
Yes.

42
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:03,915
I'm sorry Mr. Dundee
isn't here to meet you,

43
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,315
but he is here in town...

44
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:07,355
somewhere.

45
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:42,010
Welcome
to Walkabout Creek.

46
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:51,575
Oh, I took the liberty

47
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,975
of booking you into our hotel.

48
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,895
I trust that's in order?

49
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,336
Sounds just fine.

50
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:59,376
There's just
one other thing.

51
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:04,859
You did say that you were
prepared to pay the $2,500?

52
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,300
Absolutely.

53
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,621
I will see where he was
attacked and how he survived?

54
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:15,422
Miss, I assure you you'll spend
a few wonderful days here.

55
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:40,553
So tell me, what's
the side show all about?

56
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:44,715
That's just the boys
having fun and games.

57
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:46,556
Donk's never spilled a drop.

58
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:48,476
We're a pretty tough breed.

59
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:54,437
And your Mr. Dundee, does he -

60
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:56,198
No. He's very reserved.

61
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:58,880
He's a legend up here.

62
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,761
He was doing
a quiet spot of fishing,

63
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,441
when suddenly, bang-

64
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:05,643
This giant crocodile
came up,

65
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:08,843
turned him over,
bit half his leg off,

66
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:10,406
dragged him down under.

67
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:13,326
Killed it, of course.

68
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:19,047
Any normal man would have
turned up his toes and died.

69
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,968
But not our Mick.

70
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:26,571
Hundreds of miles...

71
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:29,612
snake- infested swamps...

72
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,853
on his hands and knees...

73
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:36,854
he crawled
right into Katherine.

74
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,336
Straight past the hospital

75
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:41,137
and into the first pub
for a beer.

76
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:46,018
That story's getting better
every time you tell it.

77
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:55,142
We handle ourselves pretty well
up here in the bush.

78
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:56,782
But if you're talking legend...

79
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,268
Oh, my God!

80
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:23,673
Two beers, Ida.

81
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,354
One for me,
one for me mate.

82
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:28,795
One for your mate,
you mad bugger.

83
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,955
Hang on.

84
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,398
I'm sorry if that
frightened you, Miss.

85
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,719
You see, it's stuffed.

86
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,320
Him and me both, Wal.

87
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:52,165
Michael J. "Crocodile" Dundee.

88
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,365
Never- Never Safaris.

89
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:57,848
Yeah. Never go out with us.

90
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:00,768
If you do, you'll never
come back. Right?

91
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,649
Sue Charlton, Newsday.

92
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,810
Yeah, I thought you might be.

93
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:14,333
Here, Wal. Mind Cyril for me

94
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:18,175
while I dance with
this charming young lady.

95
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,261
Legend has it a crocodile
took half your leg off.

96
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,223
A slight exaggeration.

97
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:39,303
Um...

98
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:41,384
more like a love bite really.

99
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,066
Enough about me leg.

100
00:08:47,146 --> 00:08:50,426
Let me tell you
about the rest of me.

101
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:52,349
"Up north in the Never- Never,

102
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:55,069
"Where the land is harsh and bare,

103
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,630
"Lives a mighty hunter
named Mick Dundee

104
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,550
Who dances like Fred Astaire."

105
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,871
Smooth shag, eh?

106
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:03,871
Who did he say this clown was?

107
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:04,913
Mick Dundee.

108
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:08,194
He was grabbed
by a croc on the river.

109
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:09,914
Why was he there?

110
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:11,236
It's full of crocs.

111
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:14,156
What do you reckon
he was doing?

112
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:15,957
Just a bloody poacher, eh?

113
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:17,317
Listen, you do understand

114
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:21,320
I want you to take me out
where you were attacked,

115
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,240
show me how you survived.

116
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,121
Just the two of us
out there alone-

117
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,521
I've got me reputation
to consider.

118
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,122
Hey, you, Dundee.

119
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,564
Where can a man shoot
some crocs around here, eh?

120
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:40,647
How would I know,
shit - for - brains?

121
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,208
Just relax.

122
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,530
Now come on, Dundee.

123
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,931
Every man in the joint knows

124
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:52,851
you're a bloody croc poacher.

125
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,617
Oh, sorry about that.

126
00:10:05,657 --> 00:10:09,498
I won't have anyone using
bad language in front of a lady.

127
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:10,618
Bad language?

128
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:14,861
Don't come back neither!

129
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:18,141
What was he saying
about you being a poacher?

130
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:21,982
He was just trying
to get a bite, that's all.

131
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:24,063
Donk, tonight's me lucky night.

132
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,465
Want a hit at the guts?

133
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,346
Here's a go, fellas.
Good on your Mick.

134
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,958
Give him
one of your kicks, Donk.

135
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,679
I'm sorry.
He's not normally like this.

136
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,241
I do apologize.
It's just the drink.

137
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:09,162
You mean there's
a serious side to him?

138
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,242
Hmm...

139
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,722
I can hardly wait.

140
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:28,689
Comfortable, Miss?

141
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,449
Wonderful country out here.

142
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,810
We think so.

143
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:44,454
I hope you're not going
to be the strong, silent type.

144
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,576
Me?

145
00:11:45,656 --> 00:11:47,497
Reluctant to talk about yourself?

146
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:48,937
No. Favorite subject.

147
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:49,977
Why "Crocodile"?

148
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,418
Wal's idea.

149
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,099
He reckons it makes me more
colorful for the tourist business.

150
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:00,943
How old are you?

151
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:01,903
Don't know.

152
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:03,823
Uh, what year is this?

153
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,263
You don't know?

154
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:08,144
Time doesn't mean
much up here, Miss.

155
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,064
The aborigines
don't have calendars.

156
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,947
I was raised by the local tribe.

157
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:16,308
I asked a tribal elder
when I was born.

158
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,388
He said, "In the summertime."

159
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:39,437
Is there a Mrs. "Crocodile" Dundee?

160
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:41,838
I was sort of married once.

161
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:44,238
Nice girl. Good cook.
Big-

162
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:45,359
Mick!

163
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,001
I went off on walkabout.

164
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:52,401
When I came back, she'd gone.

165
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,323
A walkabout?

166
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:56,404
That's an aboriginal habit.

167
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,605
It means to wander around

168
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:01,405
and discover new places.

169
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,725
How long were you gone?

170
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,766
A couple of months.

171
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:06,008
Try 18.

172
00:13:07,608 --> 00:13:09,449
And she didn't wait?

173
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,729
Strange girl.

174
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,690
Yeah.

175
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,375
Out of the way, Dopey!

176
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:26,077
Jesus.

177
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,880
That was amazing.

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,801
Mind over matter.

179
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,722
Old bushman's trick.

180
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:36,147
All right, Miss.
All ashore.

181
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:42,548
I'm going to leave you
in Mick's capable hands,

182
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:46,389
and I'll meet you at
the Echo Billabong on Wednesday.

183
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,557
2:20. We'd better get started.

184
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:05,238
2:20.

185
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:09,438
Yes. That's the way
we do it in the bush.

186
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Don't worry. He's the best
bushman in the territory.

187
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,082
Best pupil I ever had.

188
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:16,882
You ready, lady?

189
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:19,803
Ready as I'll ever be.

190
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:23,644
Right, well, till Wednesday.
Cheerio.

191
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:24,725
Wednesday.

192
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:28,607
What's today, Wal?

193
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:29,728
Monday.

194
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,529
Doesn't know...

195
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:39,210
doesn't care.

196
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,812
Lucky bastard.

197
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,616
You okay, lady?

198
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:55,058
Oh, I'm fine.

199
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,939
It's only about another hour
to the river,

200
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,740
but you being a sheila,

201
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,020
it'll probably take two.

202
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,543
I'll do the best I can.

203
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:10,583
Yeah.

204
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,545
The water was running
20 foot up the bank

205
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,106
during the wet season.

206
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,630
Here's what's left of me boat.

207
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:44,876
You can see where
he sunk his teeth in.

208
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,636
My God.

209
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:48,759
How big was it?

210
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,719
Uh, 1 6, 1 8 foot, maybe.

211
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,001
You were out here
hunting crocodiles in that?

212
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:59,281
No. That's illegal.

213
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,761
I was just fishing.

214
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,126
How did you get away?

215
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,046
Crocs don't like fresh meat.

216
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,287
He wasn't trying to eat me.

217
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:16,450
He just wanted to take me
down for a death roll.

218
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,370
A croc will grab you,

219
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,731
take you down
to the bottom of the water,

220
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,131
and roll you over and over

221
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,571
till you stop kicking.

222
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:28,454
Then he'll take you
to his meat safe-

223
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:30,894
rock ledge, log-

224
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:32,615
down under the water,

225
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,095
jam you under it,

226
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:36,817
tenderize you a bit.
Good eating.

227
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:42,180
He let go to get
a better grip on me,

228
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,620
and I talked him out of it.

229
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,901
Talked?

230
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,785
And you were
just out here fishing?

231
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:05,908
Well, Barramundi's
a bloody big fish.

232
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,868
It'll be getting dark soon.

233
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:11,631
I'll take you to where
I camped the first night.

234
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:33,718
You married?

235
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,161
Was once...

236
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,321
to the original rebel.

237
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,442
What happened?

238
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:41,522
You name it, we marched-

239
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,282
Anti- Nuke, Women's Lib,

240
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:44,603
Save the Whales.

241
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,523
He's probably marching right now

242
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,966
for the Gay Nazis or something.

243
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,926
Sounds like a prize ratbag.

244
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:52,406
Oh, he meant well.

245
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:55,608
Haven't you ever protested anything?

246
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:58,128
Whenever I get
thrown out of the pub.

247
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:00,049
Come on. I'm serious.

248
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:01,891
Where would someone like you

249
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:03,812
stand on the nuclear debate?

250
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:06,612
What do you think
about the arms race?

251
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:07,972
None of my business.

252
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:09,493
None of your business?

253
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,773
How can you say that?

254
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:14,254
It's everybody's business.

255
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:16,136
Got to have an opinion.

256
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,136
Got to have a voice.

257
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:23,619
Who will hear it out here?

258
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:26,419
Okay.

259
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:28,420
Something closer to home.

260
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,862
The aborigines.

261
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:33,303
What do you think
about their claims

262
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:35,143
to get the land back?

263
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,583
Ah, well, you see...

264
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:38,544
aborigines don't own the land.

265
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:40,304
They belong to it.

266
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:42,426
It's like their mother.

267
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:46,827
See those rocks sticking up there?

268
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:49,709
Been standing up there
for 600 million years.

269
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,070
Still be there when you
and I are gone.

270
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,632
So arguing over
who owns them...

271
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,113
is like two fleas

272
00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:01,713
arguing over who owns
the dog they live on.

273
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:04,714
You see, uh...

274
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:05,914
Uh...

275
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:08,475
Aborigines, well,
like all god's creatures,

276
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:11,157
want the right
to roam the earth

277
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,918
and be left in peace.

278
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,000
It's that si-

279
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,163
Oh, it's a King Brown.

280
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,363
Poisonous?

281
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:27,844
Oh, yeah. Deadly.

282
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:29,244
Not bad eating,

283
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:31,164
but they always give me gas.

284
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:36,087
Listen, are there any more
of those around?

285
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:39,008
Oh, maybe the odd one
late at night.

286
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,928
But stick close to me.

287
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,370
You'll be all right.

288
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,058
You're probably right.

289
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:06,379
A man should have an opinion.

290
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,739
Shh!

291
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:08,699
What?

292
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:12,421
Thought I heard something.

293
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,381
No. It's nothing.

294
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,862
Good night.

295
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:43,714
Mick?

296
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:13,806
It's only me.

297
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:20,407
Dangerous bastards.

298
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:22,969
It's those city cowboys.

299
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,610
What are you going to do?

300
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,330
Nothing. Why?

301
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,692
Why?

302
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,732
They're shooting these
poor kangaroos for fun.

303
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,735
There's no law against that.

304
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:47,938
Keep your head down.

305
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:49,178
Stay here.

306
00:23:58,743 --> 00:24:01,063
Hang on. I need a piss.

307
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,104
Yeah, and a straighter rifle.

308
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:06,106
You're as useless
as tits on a bull.

309
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,067
Shh! Shut up, you guys.

310
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:12,348
Hey, Trevor.

311
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:14,988
Get the spotlight
over here, mate.

312
00:24:15,068 --> 00:24:16,630
The spotlight!

313
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,031
Can't you see where
you're aiming?

314
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:20,191
Shut up!

315
00:24:23,152 --> 00:24:25,473
Not on me, you silly bugger,

316
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:27,194
on the bushes.

317
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,594
Hey-

318
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:31,236
Hey, look at this
big, cheeky bugger.

319
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:34,837
It's got a gun!

320
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:40,358
Shit!

321
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:04,048
Good one, Skippy.

322
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,350
Despite the rugged beauty
of this land,

323
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,193
there's a sort
of strange emptiness about it,

324
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:10,234
a feeling of being so alone.

325
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:11,675
But you're not alone.

326
00:26:11,755 --> 00:26:14,075
I'm here, aren't I?

327
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,476
Yeah, but I think I know

328
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,398
how you must have felt...

329
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:22,239
or how I'd feel
if I were out here alone.

330
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,399
You?

331
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,880
Out here alone?

332
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,320
That's a joke.

333
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,240
A city girl like you-

334
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,161
You wouldn't last five minutes.

335
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:33,043
This is a man's country
out here.

336
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:37,965
That's right.
I'm only a sheila.

337
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,330
We're heading for
that escarpment today, right?

338
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,770
Yeah.

339
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,010
Okay.

340
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,731
See you there this afternoon.

341
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,211
Hey!

342
00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:00,254
Take the gun.

343
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:01,814
If you get into trouble,

344
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:04,536
fire a couple shots in the air.

345
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,301
That's the dangerous end.

346
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,465
So it is.

347
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,070
Hmm.

348
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,708
It's all right. It's over.

349
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,471
Hey. Hey.

350
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,792
I got you. I got you.

351
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:19,515
Is it dead?

352
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,241
Well, if it isn't,

353
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:35,801
it'll be hell
skinning the bastard.

354
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:50,246
Well, you were right.

355
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,169
Definitely no place
for a city girl.

356
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:55,089
From what Wal's told me,

357
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:58,410
living in the city can be
just as dangerous.

358
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,852
You've never lived in a city?

359
00:32:00,892 --> 00:32:02,772
Never been to a city.

360
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:03,892
You're kidding.

361
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:05,052
No.

362
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,575
Cities are crowded, right?

363
00:32:06,615 --> 00:32:08,855
If I lived in some city,

364
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:10,776
I'd only make it worse.

365
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:12,256
Here. Try this.

366
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,779
Want me to look at that?

367
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:21,260
It's just a scratch.

368
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,140
A scratch can turn septic
out here.

369
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:28,382
Shh.

370
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:29,823
Now what?

371
00:32:34,225 --> 00:32:35,586
Oh, Christ.

372
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,986
It's like living with Davy Crockett.

373
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:44,347
Mick?

374
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:50,631
Mick.

375
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:04,037
Ah, Mick.

376
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:06,437
You frightened shit out of me.

377
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:09,318
I ought to.
Sneaking up on a man

378
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:11,718
rendering first aid to a lady.

379
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:14,121
Is that what you were doing?

380
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:18,722
It's a mate of mine.

381
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:20,323
Neville Bell, Sue Charlton.

382
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:21,563
G'day, Sue.

383
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:25,204
What are you doing

384
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:27,646
wandering around
in the scrub, Nev?

385
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,647
I'm going to a corroboree.

386
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:31,447
It's a bloody drag,

387
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:35,328
but my dad get angry
if I don't show up.

388
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:37,728
See, Nev's a real city boy,

389
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,731
but his dad's a tribal elder.

390
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,931
You can't take my photograph.

391
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:44,092
I'm sorry.

392
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:47,013
You believe it will take
your spirit away?

393
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:50,094
No. You got lens cap on.

394
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:55,097
Crikey, Mick.

395
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:57,377
I better get going.

396
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:59,538
Nice to meet you, Sue.

397
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:01,018
Bye, Nev.

398
00:34:01,058 --> 00:34:03,059
I'll catch up with you.

399
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,539
What's happening?

400
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,141
I'll go with Nev

401
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:10,022
and have a chat
with the Pintinjarra.

402
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:11,462
Can I come?

403
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,904
No. Women are strictly taboo
at these turnouts.

404
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:18,185
How does he find
his way in the dark?

405
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:21,107
He thinks his way.

406
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:24,828
A lot of people believe
that they're telepathic.

407
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,189
Ooh!

408
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:29,109
God, I hate the bush.

409
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:53,821
How did you know?

410
00:35:58,384 --> 00:35:59,945
Are you telepathic?

411
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:03,186
Nah.

412
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:04,386
Common sense.

413
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:06,787
You're a woman.
You're a reporter.

414
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:10,310
That makes you the biggest
busybody in the world.

415
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,990
I can live with that.

416
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:19,232
That croc was going
to eat me alive.

417
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:24,155
Oh, I wouldn't hold that
against him.

418
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:27,035
Same thought crossed
my mind once or twice.

419
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:35,480
Good night, Mick.

420
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,320
Mmm.

421
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:41,721
It took me a week
to crawl this far.

422
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,002
I thought I was a goner.

423
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:46,722
I said to meself,
"Mick, old son,

424
00:36:46,802 --> 00:36:48,565
"find yourself
a comfortable spot

425
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:50,405
and lay down and die."

426
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:51,685
Weren't you afraid?

427
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:52,805
Dying? Nah.

428
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:54,727
I read the Bible once.

429
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:58,088
You know God and Jesus
and all them apostles?

430
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,808
They were all fishermen
just like me.

431
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:03,851
Yep. Straight to heaven
for Mick Dundee.

432
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,012
Yep.

433
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,092
Me and God...

434
00:37:10,172 --> 00:37:12,172
we'd be mates.

435
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,098
This is Echo Lake.

436
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:29,261
I reckon this place saved me life.

437
00:37:32,222 --> 00:37:34,942
That's mineral water.
Means no crocs.

438
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:38,303
More tucker here than you can
poke a stick at.

439
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,503
Tucker?

440
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:41,425
Food. You hungry?

441
00:37:41,465 --> 00:37:42,506
I'm starving.

442
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:44,346
I'll get lunch.

443
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:55,991
How do you like your Goanna?
Medium? Well done?

444
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:58,712
You don't really expect me
to eat that.

445
00:37:58,752 --> 00:37:59,712
Yeah. It's great.

446
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:00,952
Try those yams.

447
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:02,993
Try the grubs and ants.

448
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,313
Bite the end off.
They're sweet.

449
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:07,034
Black fellas love them.

450
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:13,357
What about you?
Aren't you having any?

451
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:15,038
Me?

452
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:17,959
Ah, well...
you can live on it...

453
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,759
but it tastes like shit.

454
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:22,242
Oh!

455
00:39:29,027 --> 00:39:30,788
Mick, when I go back,

456
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,748
why don't you come along?

457
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:34,229
What for?

458
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,590
It would make a great wrap
to the story-

459
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,591
You in New York City.

460
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:43,593
Oh. For a minute there

461
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,794
I thought you were
making a pass at me.

462
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,915
Well, I might have been.

463
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:53,676
Would you mind?

464
00:40:12,564 --> 00:40:14,885
Hoo- ooh!

465
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:20,566
Bloody Wally.

466
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:23,129
He's only been here
a dozen times.

467
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:24,689
He's probably lost.

468
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:45,856
Did you, uh...

469
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:50,019
You got wind
or something, Wally?

470
00:40:57,142 --> 00:40:59,942
I want Mick to come to New York.

471
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,822
Mick? In a big city?

472
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:03,305
No chance.

473
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:05,385
Paper would pay.

474
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:10,866
Well, a man should
broaden his horizons.

475
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,270
Everything okay?

476
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,310
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No worries.

477
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:41,878
Jesus Christ!

478
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,248
Sue!

479
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:11,691
Sue!

480
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:13,451
G'day, mate!

481
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:20,174
You look absolutely stunning.

482
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:24,136
Welcome home.

483
00:42:24,216 --> 00:42:25,217
Thanks.

484
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,297
Here, let me get this.

485
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,217
Oh-

486
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:31,498
Where's the man
from the backwoods?

487
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:33,338
We got separated at customs.

488
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:35,179
He almost started a riot

489
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:37,901
when they wanted
to search his suitcase.

490
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:39,502
Ah, there he is.

491
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:43,022
So, that's Jungle Jim.

492
00:43:14,715 --> 00:43:16,677
New York City, Mr. Dundee.

493
00:43:16,757 --> 00:43:18,678
Home to seven million people.

494
00:43:18,758 --> 00:43:20,158
That's incredible.

495
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,558
Imagine seven million people

496
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:23,399
all wanting
to live together.

497
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,639
Yep. New York must be

498
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,920
the friendliest place on earth.

499
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:40,125
Watch it.

500
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:42,365
G'day!

501
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:47,448
Mick Dundee from Australia.
How are you?

502
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:49,489
I'm fine. How are you?

503
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:52,930
Good. I'm down
for a couple of days.

504
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,170
Probably see you around.

505
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,290
Fine.

506
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,893
We went from there-

507
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,100
Thank you, Gus.

508
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:26,063
You'll take care of the luggage?

509
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:27,464
Yes, sir.

510
00:44:31,065 --> 00:44:32,266
That's it.

511
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:36,987
Thanks for the lift, mate.

512
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:38,109
No problem.

513
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:39,949
What tribe are you, Gus?

514
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:41,069
Tribe?

515
00:44:41,149 --> 00:44:43,670
Man, I ain't from no tribe.

516
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,950
You're a black fellow, aren't you?

517
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,391
Last time I looked.

518
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:52,034
Nobody in our tribe
has a car like this.

519
00:44:52,114 --> 00:44:54,874
You must be doing
all right, eh?

520
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:01,717
I'll get a cab to the office.

521
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:04,279
Do you want to eat
somewhere special tonight?

522
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:06,520
I thought Tacano's
would be nice.

523
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,560
Tacano's. 7:30?

524
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,680
Mm- hmm. Great.

525
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,800
Bye.

526
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,401
O.K. Table for three.

527
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,652
Sir.

528
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:45,495
No worries.

529
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,381
Well, what do you think?

530
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:06,262
Oh, it's a bit rough,
but I'll manage.

531
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:11,545
Hey, how many of us staying here?

532
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:12,665
Just you.

533
00:46:12,705 --> 00:46:15,066
I've got my own
apartment downtown.

534
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:25,911
Oh, sorry. Mick Dundee.

535
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,791
I didn't catch the name.

536
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:28,872
Angelo.

537
00:46:28,992 --> 00:46:30,832
Pleased to meet you, Angelo.

538
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:32,352
I got it.

539
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:33,953
Here you go.

540
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:40,076
Got to pay for the room
in advance, eh?

541
00:46:40,116 --> 00:46:41,796
You're in my town now.

542
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:42,916
Trust me.

543
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:47,078
Yeah.

544
00:46:47,158 --> 00:46:50,279
Can I get the direct dialing
code for Australia?

545
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:58,243
You should be comfortable.

546
00:46:58,323 --> 00:46:59,403
Everything's here.

547
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,603
There's a TV if you're bored.

548
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:02,643
Ah, television.

549
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:07,646
Yeah, I saw that at
Darkie Johnson's place years ago.

550
00:47:13,009 --> 00:47:15,489
Yep. That's what I saw.

551
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:19,492
Right.

552
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:21,172
Okay. Thanks.

553
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,453
So, I'm writing down
Wally's number

554
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:26,053
and my office number.

555
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:27,173
Hey, Sue!

556
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:29,094
Come here. Look at this.

557
00:47:34,457 --> 00:47:37,258
Some nitwit's put
two dunnies in here.

558
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:40,019
One dunny, one bidet.

559
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:43,140
Bidet?

560
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,780
Mmm. It's for, um...

561
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,343
After you - You, um -
You know.

562
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,104
You figure it out.

563
00:47:54,944 --> 00:47:56,504
See you at 7:00.

564
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,065
Yeah.

565
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,160
For washing your backside, right?

566
00:48:53,648 --> 00:48:54,688
G'day.

567
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:08,974
G'day.

568
00:49:09,054 --> 00:49:10,575
Hi.

569
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,455
G'day.

570
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:21,419
G'day.

571
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:23,059
Hello.

572
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:24,980
G'day.

573
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,627
Oops. Sorry.

574
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:48,429
G'day.

575
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:49,750
Whoops.

576
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,270
Shit!

577
00:50:58,257 --> 00:50:59,537
Take it easy, Mick.

578
00:50:59,617 --> 00:51:00,657
Thanks, mate.

579
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:01,617
Ta.

580
00:51:01,697 --> 00:51:02,818
Bye.

581
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:05,298
G'day.

582
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:07,501
Yes, sir.

583
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:21,507
Good evening.
Follow me, please.

584
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:27,428
Hello.

585
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:30,188
Sorry we're late.

586
00:51:30,268 --> 00:51:31,469
Been waiting long?

587
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:32,749
I arrived early,

588
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:35,471
eager to spend time
with my girl.

589
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,912
What are we drinking?

590
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:37,992
Two vodka Martinis.

591
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:39,472
And what's yours, Crocodile?

592
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,794
Yeah, I'll have two of those

593
00:51:41,874 --> 00:51:43,714
and a beer, thanks.

594
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:45,594
Could you send them through

595
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:47,077
to our table, man.

596
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:54,238
You have been here a while.

597
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:55,679
Let's eat.

598
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,921
This will be quite
a novelty for you,

599
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:02,922
eating something
without having to kill it first.

600
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:04,522
Shall we?

601
00:52:05,763 --> 00:52:06,764
Ah, Roberto.

602
00:52:06,884 --> 00:52:08,204
Good evening, Mr. Mason.

603
00:52:08,244 --> 00:52:10,485
I see you've brought some friends.

604
00:52:10,565 --> 00:52:12,485
Follow me, please.

605
00:52:16,648 --> 00:52:18,008
Thank you.

606
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,772
I had almost forgotten
how sexy- looking you are.

607
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:31,533
I'll have to find a way
of keeping you in town.

608
00:52:31,573 --> 00:52:32,893
We'll work something out.

609
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:34,815
Really? Yes, what?

610
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:39,375
Listen, uh- You two
should really be alone.

611
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:43,298
Sorry. We haven't seen
each other in six weeks.

612
00:52:43,418 --> 00:52:44,499
All the more reason-

613
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:45,899
I wouldn't abandon you

614
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:47,619
your first night here.

615
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:50,180
Richard and I
want you with us.

616
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,900
Right. Absolutely.

617
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,703
New York is no place
for a country gent.

618
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:59,424
I mean, ain't no
crocodiles out there,

619
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:00,865
but a fast- moving Chevy

620
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:03,665
would sure make a mess of you.

621
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,909
What's your game?

622
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:15,910
Great. I'm starving.

623
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,030
Ha ha!
Grazie, Roberto.

624
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:22,353
Stato piacere rivederti.

625
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:25,274
Bravissimo. Lei parla
molto bene Italiano.

626
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:26,674
Thank you.

627
00:53:26,754 --> 00:53:29,956
Um, perhaps I should
order for all of us.

628
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:33,397
I don't imagine
that they have any...

629
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,559
kangaroo steak or possum grits!

630
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:36,839
Don't worry about Mick.

631
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:39,200
He can make a gourmet meal

632
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,960
out of just about anything...

633
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,600
even medium- rare Goanna.

634
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,921
It was great, wasn't it, eh?

635
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:46,761
And what about the yams?

636
00:53:46,841 --> 00:53:48,124
Oh, they were great.

637
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:50,964
Well, that's-

638
00:53:52,404 --> 00:53:53,685
That's wonderful.

639
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:57,166
So, as he's our guest,

640
00:53:57,206 --> 00:54:00,407
perhaps he'd like
to order for all of us.

641
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,970
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll do that.

642
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,010
No, it's- it's all right.

643
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,610
I'll have a lash.

644
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,412
Italian, eh?

645
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:12,892
Yes.

646
00:54:21,576 --> 00:54:24,137
I don't know what you call it,

647
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:26,017
but I'd like that dish

648
00:54:26,057 --> 00:54:27,860
the big fat sheila's eating.

649
00:54:31,821 --> 00:54:32,901
Richard!

650
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:35,621
He okay?

651
00:54:36,782 --> 00:54:39,262
Can't handle his drink, poor fella.

652
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:51,588
He said you hit him.

653
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:54,390
You're not in the
Walkabout Creek pub now.

654
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,271
He was being a pain.

655
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,231
That's beside the point.

656
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:00,992
You're not serious
about this lemon, are you?

657
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:02,552
Butt out, Dundee!

658
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,512
He had a little
too much to drink.

659
00:55:05,592 --> 00:55:08,035
Richard is warm, caring,
and I love him.

660
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:08,995
Excuse me.

661
00:55:09,075 --> 00:55:09,955
What?

662
00:55:10,035 --> 00:55:11,356
I'm going to throw up.

663
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:12,636
God.

664
00:55:31,883 --> 00:55:33,243
You want a hand?

665
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:35,086
No. I can handle it.

666
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,206
I'm fine.

667
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:41,288
We've got a busy day tomorrow,

668
00:55:41,368 --> 00:55:42,648
so get some sleep.

669
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:44,128
I'll pick you up early.

670
00:55:44,168 --> 00:55:45,209
Good night.

671
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:46,329
Night.

672
00:55:52,492 --> 00:55:54,973
You better take me
to the boozer.

673
00:55:55,053 --> 00:55:56,053
Boozer?

674
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:57,533
Don't know that one.

675
00:55:57,613 --> 00:56:00,294
Pub. You know,
somewhere to get a drink.

676
00:56:00,374 --> 00:56:01,656
Want to join me?

677
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:04,176
I just finished my shift.
Why not?

678
00:56:04,297 --> 00:56:05,897
Fancy a drink, do you?

679
00:56:05,977 --> 00:56:07,337
You kidding? I'm Italian.

680
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:11,179
I'd drink you under the table
any day, my friend.

681
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:12,819
Well, that could be interesting.

682
00:56:21,783 --> 00:56:25,224
Now, I'm not putting down
your black widow spider,

683
00:56:25,304 --> 00:56:26,904
but the funnel web spider

684
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:29,707
can kill a man
in eight seconds

685
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:32,107
just by looking at him.

686
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:35,869
Of course, the real danger
down there is the sharks-

687
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:38,750
The big ones,
you know, like Jaws?

688
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,110
I caught one three weeks ago,

689
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,553
opened it, and found
three Filipino fishermen,

690
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,953
still in their boat.

691
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:46,073
Hey, Buzzy!

692
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,074
Come on over.
Meet this guy from Australia.

693
00:56:49,154 --> 00:56:51,714
Hey, my man,
what's happening?

694
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:54,715
Uh, where?

695
00:56:54,795 --> 00:56:56,277
What's goin' down, bro'?

696
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:57,437
Goin' down?

697
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:00,358
Oh, yeah.
Just blowing the froth off a couple.

698
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:01,599
All right!

699
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:03,920
Hang loose, my man.

700
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,240
Flat out like
a lizard drinking.

701
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,520
Say what?

702
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:10,403
What?

703
00:57:17,324 --> 00:57:18,765
He's cool.

704
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:20,565
Yeah. I'm cool. I'm cool.

705
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,170
All right!

706
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:35,253
He's a nice fella.

707
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:37,654
Here's me little
Italian mate Danny.

708
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:40,534
Just in time to buy
another round, mate.

709
00:57:40,614 --> 00:57:42,455
What are you drinking,
Gwendoline?

710
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:45,335
No more.
I must be getting home.

711
00:57:45,415 --> 00:57:46,776
Oh. Where's home, sweetie?

712
00:57:46,856 --> 00:57:48,216
Just around the corner.

713
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:50,138
I have a little place

714
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:53,019
where I live all by my lonesome.

715
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:54,139
Not now.

716
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:56,541
Most of the time, that is.

717
00:57:56,621 --> 00:57:59,421
Oh. Must get a bit lonely, eh?

718
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:02,304
Hanker for a bit of,
uh, male company?

719
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:03,744
Do I ever.

720
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:05,184
Hey, come here.

721
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:06,625
Uh, excuse me, Gwendoline.

722
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:08,785
Don't go away, love.

723
00:58:11,706 --> 00:58:14,546
I been trying
to tell you all night.

724
00:58:14,586 --> 00:58:16,469
That girl. She's a guy.

725
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:17,589
Huh?

726
00:58:17,669 --> 00:58:20,309
A man dressed up as a girl.

727
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,471
Nah, nah.

728
00:58:22,551 --> 00:58:24,791
A fag, for Christ sakes!

729
00:58:28,632 --> 00:58:29,594
I swear.

730
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:44,319
Ooh!

731
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,920
That was a guy.

732
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,802
A guy dressed up like a sheila.

733
00:58:50,882 --> 00:58:53,682
Hey, you all knew,
you pack of bastards.

734
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:55,645
Hey! Ahh!

735
00:59:02,286 --> 00:59:05,087
Where the hell did
I leave the cab?

736
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,167
Don't know.

737
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:09,089
You wait here till
I go look for it.

738
00:59:09,169 --> 00:59:10,170
Righto, mate.

739
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,210
Stay there.

740
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:34,778
G'day, girls.

741
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:36,860
Mick Dundee from Australia.

742
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:40,301
Looking for a good time, honey?

743
00:59:40,381 --> 00:59:42,542
Always looking for a good time.

744
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:50,946
Are either of you, uh... ladies

745
00:59:51,026 --> 00:59:53,026
attached or married
or anything?

746
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,627
No. We're both single ladies.

747
01:00:01,188 --> 01:00:03,070
This is Karla. I'm Simone.

748
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,671
Where you from, honey?

749
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:07,591
I'm from Walkabout Creek
in the Northern Territory.

750
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:10,953
You probably don't know
where that is.

751
01:00:11,033 --> 01:00:12,433
Hey, I do.

752
01:00:12,553 --> 01:00:17,276
You're the guy I've been
reading about in the paper.

753
01:00:17,356 --> 01:00:18,757
The crocodile man.

754
01:00:18,797 --> 01:00:21,557
I've been reading
about him in the paper.

755
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:23,478
He's like a regular Tarzan-

756
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:25,478
Wrestles crocodiles,
eats snakes.

757
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:30,801
Is this your first trip
to New York?

758
01:00:34,002 --> 01:00:35,442
First trip anywhere.

759
01:00:35,482 --> 01:00:36,523
Well, hell.

760
01:00:36,603 --> 01:00:39,924
We might just have
to give you one for free.

761
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:42,805
Yeah.

762
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:46,047
One what?

763
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:58,292
Ah, maybe we could
take in a movie

764
01:00:58,332 --> 01:01:00,212
or go to a dance.

765
01:01:00,252 --> 01:01:01,292
Hey, girls, girls.

766
01:01:01,372 --> 01:01:04,574
Are we working tonight
or are we socializing?

767
01:01:04,654 --> 01:01:05,534
Hey, pal.

768
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:09,375
I was talking to the ladies

769
01:01:09,455 --> 01:01:10,977
and making progress.

770
01:01:11,097 --> 01:01:13,418
Are you going to talk all night

771
01:01:13,498 --> 01:01:15,218
or screw one of them?

772
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,900
I'm sorry about that,

773
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,303
but if you stand around
a place like this,

774
01:01:26,343 --> 01:01:29,183
you'll hear that kind
of bad language.

775
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:31,705
I should've been home hours ago.

776
01:01:31,785 --> 01:01:33,665
Nice chatting to you, ladies.

777
01:01:33,785 --> 01:01:36,106
You're in no condition to drive.

778
01:01:36,146 --> 01:01:37,188
Hop in, mate.

779
01:01:39,548 --> 01:01:42,829
That's why you have
so many accidents over here-

780
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:46,550
The steering wheel's
on the wrong side of the car.

781
01:01:53,473 --> 01:01:55,834
Get out of the way, Dopey!

782
01:01:57,155 --> 01:02:00,876
Get on the right side
of the road, you pelican!

783
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,281
If I give my heart to you

784
01:02:16,963 --> 01:02:19,723
Then I'll have none,
and you'll have two

785
01:02:44,654 --> 01:02:46,054
Senor Mick?

786
01:02:46,134 --> 01:02:49,095
The towels for Senor Mick.

787
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:50,816
Is that you, Rosita?

788
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:54,777
Just leave the spare towels
on the bed, will you?

789
01:02:54,857 --> 01:02:56,137
Mucho gracias, love.

790
01:02:58,259 --> 01:02:59,740
Si, Senor Mick.

791
01:03:14,025 --> 01:03:15,065
'Struth!

792
01:03:15,145 --> 01:03:17,226
Um... Hey, listen, uh...

793
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,787
Rosita, uh-
I was only being friendly.

794
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:24,630
You know, I didn't mean, um-

795
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,710
Your towels, Senor Mick.

796
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:28,351
Oh. Whew.

797
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:35,312
For a minute there,

798
01:03:35,392 --> 01:03:38,835
room service took on
a whole new meaning.

799
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,718
Whew.

800
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:10,286
One dog, please.

801
01:04:13,288 --> 01:04:15,808
With chili, onions, sauerkraut,

802
01:04:15,928 --> 01:04:17,169
and some peppers.

803
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,252
There you go.

804
01:04:24,332 --> 01:04:26,172
You eat that?

805
01:04:26,252 --> 01:04:28,973
Well, you know,
you can live on it,

806
01:04:29,013 --> 01:04:30,895
but it tastes like shit.

807
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:31,896
Ahh!

808
01:04:58,906 --> 01:05:00,226
Aah! My bag!

809
01:05:00,306 --> 01:05:01,387
Stop him!

810
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,987
Thief! Thief!

811
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:20,994
I can't believe that
you're alone in here

812
01:05:21,034 --> 01:05:24,274
Let me warm your hands
against the cold

813
01:05:25,837 --> 01:05:28,837
A close encounter
with a hardhearted man

814
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:31,839
Who never gave half
of what he got

815
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:36,520
Has made you wish that
you had never been born

816
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,963
That's a shame
'cause you've got a lot

817
01:05:41,043 --> 01:05:44,003
Fate left you
with a sad face

818
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:47,524
Come up to my place
and give it up

819
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,164
You beside me

820
01:05:49,284 --> 01:05:50,365
Hey, Mick!

821
01:05:50,445 --> 01:05:51,807
How you doing, baby?

822
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:53,287
It's me- Simone!

823
01:05:53,327 --> 01:05:54,688
Oh, yeah, Simone.

824
01:05:54,768 --> 01:05:56,168
Having a good time?

825
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,168
As always.

826
01:05:58,449 --> 01:06:00,690
Nice girl.
Thoughtful, too-

827
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,090
Dancing with her father.

828
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,210
Hmm.

829
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,611
We're going to have to overcome

830
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:07,013
this country boy shyness, Dundee.

831
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:08,133
Hi.

832
01:06:08,213 --> 01:06:09,294
Yeah.

833
01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:12,054
Oh, there's someone
I want you to meet.

834
01:06:15,735 --> 01:06:18,217
Ah! Sue, darling!
You're back.

835
01:06:18,297 --> 01:06:19,538
How wonderful.

836
01:06:19,578 --> 01:06:21,018
Fran, how are you?

837
01:06:21,058 --> 01:06:22,458
Couldn't be better.

838
01:06:23,739 --> 01:06:26,580
Tell me.
Who's the new man?

839
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,821
This is the man I'm writing
about, Mick Dundee.

840
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:33,183
Something the matter, darling?

841
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:36,544
Oh!

842
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:37,984
Pleased to meet you.

843
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:40,585
It's okay.
He's Australian.

844
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:44,106
Maybe I'd better go there someday.

845
01:06:45,988 --> 01:06:48,789
Oh, darling, I'm so glad
you could come.

846
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:49,789
Excuse me.

847
01:06:54,471 --> 01:06:55,831
Ah.Just making sure.

848
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:56,951
Right.

849
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:58,914
I'll get us a drink.

850
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:02,995
How can you see

851
01:07:03,075 --> 01:07:04,915
Looking through
those tears

852
01:07:04,995 --> 01:07:07,836
Don't you know you're
worth your weight in gold

853
01:07:09,436 --> 01:07:10,476
I can't believe

854
01:07:10,556 --> 01:07:12,238
That you're alone in here

855
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:15,679
Let me warm your hands
against the cold

856
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,480
If you smile

857
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:20,081
You'll walk on out

858
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:23,242
On all the people
in this pickup joint

859
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:26,004
But if you laugh

860
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:27,965
You'll level this town

861
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:29,525
Hey, look, girl

862
01:07:29,605 --> 01:07:31,165
That's just the point

863
01:07:32,326 --> 01:07:35,446
Hey there,
beautiful sad face

864
01:07:35,526 --> 01:07:37,367
Come up to my place

865
01:07:37,447 --> 01:07:39,449
And give it up

866
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:40,889
It's good shit.

867
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:44,650
Let's get it on

868
01:07:46,892 --> 01:07:49,572
Let's get it on

869
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:51,693
It's a different world

870
01:07:53,295 --> 01:07:55,055
But the heat's the same

871
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,736
Head of New York City

872
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,217
Do you know my name

873
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,620
What more could I ask for?

874
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,181
Don't make me ask

875
01:08:12,262 --> 01:08:12,982
Don't

876
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:16,423
One day I might get there

877
01:08:18,945 --> 01:08:20,665
I turned around

878
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:23,866
If you had looked

879
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:27,187
You'd know there's something

880
01:08:27,267 --> 01:08:29,387
Bothering me

881
01:08:31,548 --> 01:08:32,910
What's up, pal?

882
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,870
Got a blocked nose?

883
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:37,351
Blocked nose, right.

884
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,753
There's a better way
of doing it than that.

885
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:42,193
Better way, huh?

886
01:08:42,233 --> 01:08:43,193
Yep.

887
01:08:46,276 --> 01:08:49,076
It's the way we do it back home.

888
01:08:49,156 --> 01:08:50,917
It really fixes us up.

889
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:02,041
Now. Boiling water.

890
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:05,522
Get the steam going right.

891
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:07,923
Get
your face right over there.

892
01:09:07,963 --> 01:09:10,804
The old tea towel
right over your skull.

893
01:09:10,844 --> 01:09:13,686
Put your head
right down onto that.

894
01:09:13,726 --> 01:09:15,007
Breathe in real deep.

895
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:16,567
Ten minutes of that,

896
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:19,328
you'll be clear as a bell.
No worries.

897
01:09:20,928 --> 01:09:22,208
Get into it.

898
01:09:30,012 --> 01:09:31,252
Get into it.

899
01:09:35,174 --> 01:09:37,534
You know, Mick,
that was probably

900
01:09:37,614 --> 01:09:40,417
a couple hundred dollars
worth of cocaine.

901
01:09:40,497 --> 01:09:41,537
What's that?

902
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:42,977
It's a drug.

903
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:44,298
You sniff it.

904
01:09:45,418 --> 01:09:46,498
What for?

905
01:09:46,538 --> 01:09:48,418
Well, to get a buzz.

906
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:54,382
What, like shoving
a blowfly up your nose?

907
01:10:06,307 --> 01:10:08,428
Got the photo, Mick.

908
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:09,908
I look great.

909
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:11,468
Ha ha ha ha!

910
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:12,909
Ida sends love.

911
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,349
Wait a minute.

912
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:16,629
Donk wants a word to you.

913
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:18,830
Mick!

914
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:19,952
Get stuffed!

915
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:21,432
Ha ha ha.

916
01:10:21,472 --> 01:10:22,512
Very good.

917
01:10:22,592 --> 01:10:25,433
How you getting on
with the New Yorkers?

918
01:10:25,473 --> 01:10:26,874
Oh, bonzer people.

919
01:10:26,914 --> 01:10:28,315
Friendly, full of beans,

920
01:10:28,355 --> 01:10:29,715
but, uh- a bit weird.

921
01:10:29,755 --> 01:10:32,155
Well, that's the joys of traveling.

922
01:10:32,235 --> 01:10:34,718
When are you
coming home, mate?

923
01:10:34,798 --> 01:10:37,719
If you can manage,
I'll stay a while.

924
01:10:37,759 --> 01:10:40,159
Oh, yeah.
No troubles at all.

925
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,079
Wouldn't have anything to do

926
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,520
with a certain lady writer,
would it?

927
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,603
To start with, she's
a better kisser than Donk.

928
01:10:48,683 --> 01:10:51,163
You little beauty.

929
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:53,004
Keep in touch.

930
01:10:53,084 --> 01:10:55,885
Yeah. No worries, Wal.
Ta ta.

931
01:10:58,286 --> 01:10:59,686
What'd he say?

932
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:02,569
Well, he wants to stay there
a while longer.

933
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:05,329
Wants me to take
care of things here.

934
01:11:16,213 --> 01:11:17,934
You got a light, buddy?

935
01:11:18,014 --> 01:11:19,574
Yeah. Sure, kid.

936
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:20,935
There you go.

937
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:23,336
And your wallet.

938
01:11:24,816 --> 01:11:27,219
Mick, give him your wallet.

939
01:11:27,299 --> 01:11:28,339
What for?

940
01:11:28,419 --> 01:11:29,779
He's got a knife.

941
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,700
Ha ha ha.

942
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,220
That's not a knife.

943
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:37,701
That's a knife.

944
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:45,184
Shit!

945
01:11:51,147 --> 01:11:52,507
Just kids having fun.

946
01:11:52,587 --> 01:11:53,829
Are you all right?

947
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,190
I'm always all right
when I'm with you, Dundee.

948
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:58,630
God, that sounds corny.

949
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:02,711
Why do you make me feel
like Jane in a Tarzan comic?

950
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:05,312
Ah! Ah!

951
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:52,211
That's what we ran
while you were Down Under.

952
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:55,492
Sorry. Can't seem
to get my mind in gear.

953
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:00,975
Sue, when you were away,

954
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:05,056
I, uh-
I did some thinking.

955
01:13:05,776 --> 01:13:08,578
It's time I made
some concrete plans.

956
01:13:08,658 --> 01:13:10,218
Are you building a freeway

957
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:13,298
or proposing to New York State's
finest catch?

958
01:13:13,379 --> 01:13:14,821
Hello, young lady.

959
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:16,261
Been reading your articles.

960
01:13:16,341 --> 01:13:19,662
It seems you've been
tripping all over the world

961
01:13:19,742 --> 01:13:21,062
at our expense.

962
01:13:21,142 --> 01:13:24,903
I'd like to think you're getting
your money's worth.

963
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,023
Hi, Dad.

964
01:13:26,103 --> 01:13:28,826
You got a kiss
for the old man?

965
01:13:33,627 --> 01:13:35,388
Thank God
you're home safe.

966
01:13:36,548 --> 01:13:38,909
Have you told Sue about Sunday?

967
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:40,871
I was just about to.

968
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:43,672
You're coming to
the weekend house for dinner.

969
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,512
Right now, Richard
can explain

970
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:48,393
how he runs this newspaper
better than I do

971
01:13:48,473 --> 01:13:49,833
when I'm away.

972
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:51,393
Bring along this
Crocodile Dundee.

973
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:53,234
Him, I've got to meet.

974
01:14:25,647 --> 01:14:28,449
Thought you said
your dad sells newspapers.

975
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:29,729
Oh, well-

976
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:31,890
He sells a lot of newspapers.

977
01:14:53,058 --> 01:14:54,378
Thank you, Gus.

978
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,903
Oh, hell.
The dogs are out.

979
01:15:03,023 --> 01:15:03,983
Mick.

980
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,521
Nice to see you again, Miss.

981
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:52,801
Mr. Mason.

982
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:56,164
Good to see you
looking so fit and well.

983
01:15:56,244 --> 01:15:57,364
Simpson, Mr. Dundee.

984
01:15:58,484 --> 01:16:00,365
Nice to meet you, Simo.

985
01:16:03,365 --> 01:16:04,766
Call me Mick.

986
01:16:04,806 --> 01:16:06,446
Mick.

987
01:16:06,526 --> 01:16:08,368
Your father's expecting you, Miss.

988
01:16:08,448 --> 01:16:11,129
He's waiting with his guests
in the lounge.

989
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:22,374
And she was in great danger-

990
01:16:22,414 --> 01:16:23,775
Oh, excuse me.

991
01:16:26,535 --> 01:16:27,575
Hiya, pumpkin.

992
01:16:27,655 --> 01:16:28,696
Hi, Dad.

993
01:16:28,776 --> 01:16:29,976
Richard.

994
01:16:30,056 --> 01:16:31,416
Good to see you.

995
01:16:31,496 --> 01:16:32,856
This must be Mr. Dundee.

996
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:34,137
Yep.

997
01:16:34,217 --> 01:16:37,059
I'm in your debt
for saving Sue's life.

998
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:38,460
Buy me a beer,

999
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,420
and we'll call it quits.

1000
01:16:43,102 --> 01:16:44,502
Nice joint you got.

1001
01:16:44,582 --> 01:16:47,382
Well, it keeps
the rain off our heads.

1002
01:16:47,462 --> 01:16:50,265
Come. I want you
to meet some people.

1003
01:16:50,345 --> 01:16:51,705
Patricia, a drink
for Mr. Dundee.

1004
01:16:51,785 --> 01:16:54,106
Oh, my God, look who's here.

1005
01:16:54,186 --> 01:16:55,506
My, uh- Dawn.

1006
01:16:55,546 --> 01:16:56,746
How are you?

1007
01:16:56,826 --> 01:16:58,027
Dorothy and Wendell Wainright.

1008
01:16:58,107 --> 01:16:59,147
From Australia.

1009
01:16:59,227 --> 01:17:01,147
Nice to meet you, Wendell.

1010
01:17:01,227 --> 01:17:02,589
Have a drink.

1011
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:03,710
Thank you.

1012
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,630
Are you involved in cattle?

1013
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,070
Yeah. Mostly buffaloes.

1014
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,992
Oh. Do you breed them?

1015
01:17:09,072 --> 01:17:10,432
No, just toss them.

1016
01:17:10,512 --> 01:17:13,313
And how are you finding New York?

1017
01:17:13,393 --> 01:17:15,715
Bit of a lunatic asylum, eh?

1018
01:17:15,795 --> 01:17:17,636
That's why I love it.

1019
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:18,996
I fit right in.

1020
01:17:20,116 --> 01:17:21,476
If you'll excuse me,

1021
01:17:21,556 --> 01:17:24,357
I'd like to introduce Mick
to Senator Manly.

1022
01:17:24,437 --> 01:17:25,797
Nice meeting you.

1023
01:17:25,877 --> 01:17:27,158
See you later.

1024
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:30,160
Seems like a personable fellow.

1025
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,560
What a strange gentleman.

1026
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,961
Nice people.

1027
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,401
Dorothy's fine now,

1028
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:37,283
but she used to be really uptight.

1029
01:17:37,363 --> 01:17:38,563
What happened?

1030
01:17:38,643 --> 01:17:40,243
She found a wonderful shrink.

1031
01:17:41,363 --> 01:17:42,486
Psychiatrist.

1032
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:46,246
I shouldn't have made that crack

1033
01:17:46,326 --> 01:17:47,607
about the lunatic asylum.

1034
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:51,207
Didn't know she was nuts.

1035
01:17:51,287 --> 01:17:53,128
Of course she's not nuts.

1036
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:56,010
People go to a psychiatrist
to discuss problems.

1037
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:58,411
She just needed
to unload them.

1038
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:01,292
You know, bring them
out in the open.

1039
01:18:01,372 --> 01:18:03,213
Hasn't she got any mates?

1040
01:18:03,293 --> 01:18:06,094
You're right. We could
all use more mates.

1041
01:18:06,174 --> 01:18:08,974
You don't have shrinks
at Walkabout Creek?

1042
01:18:09,054 --> 01:18:11,857
If you got a problem,
you tell Wally.

1043
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,777
He tells everyone in town,

1044
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:16,178
brings it out in the open,

1045
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:17,258
no more problem.

1046
01:18:18,578 --> 01:18:19,658
Richard!

1047
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:21,579
Wendell, it's wonderful seeing you.

1048
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:24,301
I don't believe I know your daughter.

1049
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:26,022
Oh, stop it!
Oh, Richard!

1050
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:37,667
Ladies and gentlemen...

1051
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:38,907
friends.

1052
01:18:38,987 --> 01:18:40,828
Welcome home, Sue.

1053
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:47,429
As you can see,

1054
01:18:47,509 --> 01:18:50,312
we're all glad
to have you back.

1055
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,192
Of course, no one more than I.

1056
01:18:53,272 --> 01:18:55,593
I guess everyone in this room

1057
01:18:55,673 --> 01:18:58,474
knows how this beautiful lady and I

1058
01:18:58,554 --> 01:18:59,915
feel about each other.

1059
01:18:59,995 --> 01:19:01,835
Sue's come back to us,

1060
01:19:01,915 --> 01:19:04,718
delivered, literally,
out of the jaws of death

1061
01:19:04,798 --> 01:19:07,998
by our newfound friend,
Mr. Michael J. Dundee.

1062
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:12,679
A man to whom
I am doubly indebted.

1063
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:17,362
Not only did he bring back
the woman I love,

1064
01:19:17,442 --> 01:19:19,323
he increased
the newspaper's circulation.

1065
01:19:19,403 --> 01:19:22,803
Sam said to me earlier,
"You're her editor.

1066
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:24,245
"Can't you stop her

1067
01:19:24,325 --> 01:19:26,645
from taking all these
dangerous assignments?"

1068
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:29,526
Obviously, I haven't had
a great deal of success

1069
01:19:29,608 --> 01:19:31,408
influencing her as her editor.

1070
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:33,608
Perhaps I'll have more success

1071
01:19:33,688 --> 01:19:35,369
as her husband.

1072
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:38,129
If she'll have me.

1073
01:19:38,169 --> 01:19:39,570
Oh, Richard.

1074
01:20:02,179 --> 01:20:03,220
Congratulations.

1075
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,540
It's a pleasure having you here.

1076
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,141
Well done.

1077
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,943
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

1078
01:20:13,664 --> 01:20:14,664
Sweetheart?

1079
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:32,351
I'll get in the back, Gus.

1080
01:20:49,037 --> 01:20:50,439
The hotel, Mick?

1081
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:54,280
Yeah, Gus.
By way of a liquor store.

1082
01:20:59,441 --> 01:21:00,961
For medicinal purposes.

1083
01:21:03,444 --> 01:21:05,004
Thanks, mate.

1084
01:21:26,452 --> 01:21:28,572
Hey, you take care now.

1085
01:21:48,861 --> 01:21:49,941
Hey, buddy.

1086
01:21:52,862 --> 01:21:54,702
Get it into you, Pop.

1087
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:57,505
God bless you.
You saved my life, really.

1088
01:22:08,068 --> 01:22:09,468
Hey, Simone.

1089
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:16,032
You want some action?

1090
01:22:16,112 --> 01:22:19,993
Uh, I thought you were
somebody else.

1091
01:22:21,193 --> 01:22:23,473
Well, if it ain't the man

1092
01:22:23,513 --> 01:22:27,596
who don't like bad fuckin'
language in front of ladies.

1093
01:22:27,636 --> 01:22:29,356
What's the matter, Aussie Boy?

1094
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,918
You going to hop away
like a kangaroo?

1095
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:54,327
Time for a little tap dance.

1096
01:23:23,978 --> 01:23:25,219
You okay, Mick?

1097
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:28,380
Oh, yeah, Gus.
No worries.

1098
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,142
I was just getting
on top of them.

1099
01:23:41,544 --> 01:23:43,905
You sure you're not
Pintinjarra tribe?

1100
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:47,067
No, man.
Harlem Warlords.

1101
01:23:47,187 --> 01:23:48,908
I knew you were tribal.

1102
01:23:57,751 --> 01:24:00,113
Mick Dundee's room, please.

1103
01:24:14,358 --> 01:24:16,759
I'm sorry.
He's still not answering.

1104
01:24:16,879 --> 01:24:19,800
He said this morning
he was checking out today.

1105
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,241
We're going to miss him
around here.

1106
01:24:22,321 --> 01:24:23,281
Thanks.

1107
01:24:33,205 --> 01:24:34,445
Thank you, sir.

1108
01:24:42,769 --> 01:24:45,130
G'day, Irving.
How are you, mate?

1109
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,531
I wouldn't be dead for dollars.

1110
01:24:47,571 --> 01:24:48,611
Close.

1111
01:24:48,691 --> 01:24:50,571
Are you going back home?

1112
01:24:50,611 --> 01:24:53,614
Ah, no. I thought
I'd go walkabout.

1113
01:24:53,694 --> 01:24:55,294
Uh...

1114
01:24:55,374 --> 01:24:57,655
I'll wander around,
look at America.

1115
01:24:57,735 --> 01:24:59,375
For how long?

1116
01:24:59,455 --> 01:25:00,816
Long as it takes.

1117
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:03,616
What's the quickest way
out of town?

1118
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:06,059
If you're looking for adventure,

1119
01:25:06,139 --> 01:25:08,499
a subway two blocks that way

1120
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:11,380
will take you
to Grand Central Station.

1121
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,621
That'll do.

1122
01:25:12,701 --> 01:25:14,581
Have a nice day, "Oiving."

1123
01:25:14,661 --> 01:25:16,902
No worries, mate.

1124
01:25:44,032 --> 01:25:44,913
Morning, Miss.

1125
01:25:44,993 --> 01:25:46,075
Morning.

1126
01:25:46,155 --> 01:25:48,995
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1127
01:25:49,035 --> 01:25:51,796
No, but it will come to me.

1128
01:25:51,876 --> 01:25:54,196
If you're looking
for Crocodile Mick,

1129
01:25:54,277 --> 01:25:55,597
he's gone walkabout.

1130
01:25:55,677 --> 01:25:57,837
Do you know where?

1131
01:25:57,917 --> 01:26:00,760
He's headed for the subway
two blocks down.

1132
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,200
You'd better hurry.

1133
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,640
Mind this for me.

1134
01:26:12,845 --> 01:26:14,046
Oh, Christ!

1135
01:27:31,034 --> 01:27:32,877
Hey, lady, where you going?

1136
01:27:32,957 --> 01:27:35,757
If you want to play,
play with me.

1137
01:27:42,559 --> 01:27:43,759
Mick!

1138
01:27:43,879 --> 01:27:45,439
Mick Dundee!

1139
01:27:46,922 --> 01:27:48,362
Ooowweee!

1140
01:27:48,442 --> 01:27:49,842
What's up, lady?

1141
01:27:49,882 --> 01:27:52,884
I got to talk to that man
down the end.

1142
01:27:52,964 --> 01:27:54,804
The one in the black hat.

1143
01:27:57,765 --> 01:27:58,725
Hey!

1144
01:28:02,728 --> 01:28:06,129
Lady wants to talk
to the guy in the black hat!

1145
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,329
Hey, fella!

1146
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,210
You in the hat!

1147
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:15,572
The lady down the end
wants to see you!

1148
01:28:15,612 --> 01:28:17,533
What does she want?

1149
01:28:18,973 --> 01:28:20,855
What does she want?

1150
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,775
What do you want?

1151
01:28:24,735 --> 01:28:26,618
Tell him not to leave.

1152
01:28:26,658 --> 01:28:29,778
I'm not going to
marry Richard.

1153
01:28:32,419 --> 01:28:33,819
Tell him don't leave.

1154
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:36,500
She's not going
to marry Richard.

1155
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:37,820
Don't leave.

1156
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:40,663
I'm not going to marry Richard.

1157
01:28:43,623 --> 01:28:45,024
Why not?

1158
01:28:45,064 --> 01:28:46,465
I don't know.

1159
01:28:46,505 --> 01:28:50,426
Why not?

1160
01:28:52,586 --> 01:28:55,269
Tell him I love him.

1161
01:28:55,309 --> 01:28:56,749
I love you!

1162
01:28:58,349 --> 01:28:59,870
I love ya!

1163
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:05,511
I love ya!

1164
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:07,513
She loves me.

1165
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:08,913
Well?

1166
01:29:08,953 --> 01:29:10,354
Um, tell her-

1167
01:29:10,394 --> 01:29:12,995
I'll tell her meself.
I'm coming through.

1168
01:29:13,075 --> 01:29:16,596
He's coming through!

1169
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:22,559
It's too crowded.

1170
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,000
