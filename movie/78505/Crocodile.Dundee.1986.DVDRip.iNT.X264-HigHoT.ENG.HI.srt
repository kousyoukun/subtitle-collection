1
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,360
<i>(MAN) Sue, don't misunderstand me.</i>

2
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:39,923
I'm not complaining about your work.
I have your latest piece here, it's great.

3
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,201
But you were due back yesterday.

4
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,442
But, Richard, there's one more story
I just have to do.

5
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,558
- <i>There's always one more story.</i>
- But listen to this.

6
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:53,440
Last month this guy in the Northern
Territory was attacked by a crocodile.

7
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:58,201
It bit his leg right off, left him there
to die a hundred miles from nowhere.

8
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:01,681
A week later he crawls out of the bush,
gets patched up and disappears.

9
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,600
<i>No interviews, no pictures, nothing.</i>
<i>I tracked him down.</i>

10
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:09,884
He runs a safari business out
of somewhere called Walkabout Creek.

11
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:13,558
<i>And his name... get this.</i>

12
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:17,757
Michael J. Crocodile Dundee.

13
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:21,401
Even if this is for real,
it could take weeks to nail him down.

14
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:26,002
I've made arrangements to meet him.
I got a chopper meeting me,

15
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:28,600
I'll be there tonight.

16
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:32,002
Yeah... OK...

17
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,402
- I really miss you, darling.
- <i>I miss you, too.</i>

18
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:39,041
- <i>Take care now.</i>
- Don't worry, I'm a New Yorker!

19
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:29,874
Walter Reilly, Never-Never Safaris.
I'm Mr Dundee's business partner.

20
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,322
- Nice to meet you, Mr Reilly.
- Please, call me Walter.

21
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:36,682
We're pretty informal in the bush.

22
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,041
No... let me.

23
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:50,121
There you go.

24
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,400
- You all right?
- Yes.

25
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm sorry that Mr Dundee isn't here
himself to meet you, but...

26
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,921
...he is here in town... somewhere.

27
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:41,921
Welcome to Walkabout Creek.

28
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:55,283
I took the liberty of booking you
into our hotel. I trust that's in order?

29
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:59,040
- Sounds just fine.
- There's just one other thing...

30
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:04,683
You did say that you were prepared
to pay the $2,500?

31
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:10,045
Absolutely. And I'll see where
he was attacked and how he survived?

32
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:15,643
Miss, I assure you you're gonna spend
a few wonderful days here.

33
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,963
<i>Five bucks, anyone</i>
<i>who can make Donk spill it.</i>

34
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:43,604
- What's the sideshow all about?
- Just the boys having fun and games.

35
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:48,799
Donk's never spilled a drop.
We're a pretty tough breed up here.

36
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:55,761
- And your Mr Dundee, does he...
- No, he's very reserved.

37
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,599
He's a legend up here.

38
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:03,321
There he was doing a quiet spot
of fishing when all of a sudden... bang!

39
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:09,045
This giant crocodile came up,
turned him over, bit half his leg off,

40
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,196
dragged him down under.

41
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,198
Killed it, of course.

42
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:20,004
I mean, any normal man would have
just turned up his toes and died.

43
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:24,323
But not our Mick. No.

44
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,483
Hundreds of miles...

45
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:30,561
Snake-infested swamps...

46
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:36,362
On his hands and knees
he crawled right into Katherine.

47
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:41,121
Straight past the hospital
and into the first pub for a beer!

48
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:46,923
That story's getting better
every time you tell it, Wally!

49
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:55,481
We handle ourselves pretty well here.
But if you're talking legend...

50
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:09,238
Oh, my God!

51
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,841
Two beers, Ide... one for me,
one for me mate.

52
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:29,202
"One for your mate", you mad bugger!

53
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,157
Oh, hang on...

54
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:38,681
I'm sorry if that frightened you, Miss.
You see, it's stuffed.

55
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:42,799
Him and me both, Wal.

56
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,080
Michael J. Crocodile Dundee.

57
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:56,922
- Never-Never Safaris.
- Yes.

58
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:02,153
Never go out with us. If you do,
you'll never come back. Right, Wal?

59
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,760
Sue Charlton, Newsday.

60
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,800
Yeah, I thought you might be.

61
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,518
(MUSIC PLAYS)

62
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:18,722
Here, Wal. Mind Cyril for me while
I dance with this charming young lady.

63
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:36,121
Legend has it
a crocodile took half your leg off.

64
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:39,123
A slight exaggeration.

65
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:42,840
More like a love bite, really.

66
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:50,520
There you are, enough about me leg.
Let me tell you about the rest of me.

67
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:54,280
Up north in the Never-Never,
where the land is harsh and bare,

68
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,919
lives a mighty hunter
named Mick Dundee

69
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:58,996
who can dance like Fred Astaire.

70
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,765
Smooth, Shag, eh?

71
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:05,321
- What was the name of this clown?
- Mick Dundee.

72
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:08,318
The bloke that was grabbed
by a croc on the Rapid River.

73
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:13,724
- What was he doing up there?
- It's full of crocs! What do you think?

74
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,756
Just a bloody poacher, eh?

75
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:20,843
I want you to take me
where you were attacked.

76
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:24,481
Show me how you survived.

77
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:28,240
Just the two of us out there alone?
I got my reputation to think about.

78
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:33,473
Hey, Dundee! Where can a man shoot
a few crocs around here?

79
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:40,523
How would I know, Shit-For-Brains?

80
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,644
Just relax.

81
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:52,962
Every man and his dog in the joint
know you're nothing but a croc poacher.

82
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:08,840
Sorry, but I won't have anyone
using bad language in front of a lady.

83
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:10,518
Bad language?

84
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:14,558
Don't come back!

85
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:18,441
What was he saying
about you being a poacher?

86
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:21,523
He was just trying to get a bite.

87
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:27,402
- Donk, tonight's me lucky night.
- You want to have a hit at my guts?

88
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:31,399
Put your money on me, guys!

89
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:43,160
Come on, Mick.

90
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:59,043
Give him one of your kicks, Donk!

91
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:03,163
I'm sorry, he's not normally like this.

92
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:06,402
I do apologise, it's just the drink.

93
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:10,001
You mean,
there's a serious side to him?

94
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:12,805
I can hardly wait.

95
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:28,319
Comfortable, Miss?

96
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:32,484
- Wonderful country out here.
- We think so.

97
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:44,999
I hope you're not gonna be
the strong, silent type.

98
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:49,079
- Reluctant to talk about yourself?
- Nah, favourite subject.

99
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:51,924
- Why 'Crocodile'?
- Wal's idea.

100
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:56,323
He reckons it makes me more
colourful for the tourist business.

101
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:02,044
(SUE) How old are you?
(MICK) Dunno.

102
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,964
(MICK) What year is this?
(SUE) You don't know?

103
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:09,841
(WALT) Time doesn't mean much up here.
The Aborigines don't have calendars.

104
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:12,161
(MICK) I was raised by the local tribe.

105
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,960
I asked one of the tribal elders
when I was born, and he said,

106
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:18,804
"In the summertime."

107
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:39,323
And is there a Mrs Crocodile Dundee?

108
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:44,963
I was sort of married once.
Nice girl, good cook. Big...

109
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:52,044
I went off on a Walkabout,
and when I came back, she'd gone.

110
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:56,201
- A 'Walkabout'?
- That's an Aboriginal habit.

111
00:12:56,445 --> 00:13:01,121
It means to wander around
and discover new places.

112
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:04,479
- How long were you gone?
- Couple of months.

113
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:06,961
Try eighteen.

114
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:10,597
And she didn't wait? Strange girl.

115
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,282
Yeah.

116
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:26,281
Out of the way, dopey!

117
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:25,958
Jesus...

118
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:33,204
- That was amazing.
- Mind over matter.

119
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:35,401
Old bushman's trick.

120
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,963
All right, Miss, all ashore.

121
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:42,200
Now I'm gonna leave you
in Mick's capable hands,

122
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:47,041
and I'll meet you
at the Echo Billabong on Wednesday.

123
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:03,041
2.20. We'd better get started.

124
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:08,404
- 2.20?
- That's the way we do it in the bush.

125
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:14,874
Don't worry, he's the best bushman
in the territory. Best pupil I ever had.

126
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:20,004
- You ready, lady?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

127
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:25,040
- Right, well, till Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

128
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,721
- What's today, Wal?
- Monday.

129
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,038
Doesn't know... doesn't care.

130
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,321
Lucky bastard.

131
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:55,403
- You OK, lady?
- I'm fine.

132
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:03,480
It's only about another hour
to the river, but you being a sheila...

133
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,841
...it'll probably take two.

134
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:10,762
- Well, I'll just do the best I can.
- Yeah.

135
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:20,324
The water was running twenty foot
up the bank during the wet season.

136
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:32,563
Here's what's left of me boat.

137
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:46,480
You can see
where he sunk his teeth in.

138
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:52,805
- How big was it?
- Oh, sixteen, eighteen foot, maybe.

139
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:58,202
And you were out here
hunting crocodiles in that?

140
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,721
Nah, that's illegal. I was just fishing.

141
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:10,441
- How did you get away?
- Crocs don't like fresh meat.

142
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:16,242
He wasn't trying to eat me. He wanted
to take me down for a death roll.

143
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:21,724
See, a croc will grab you and take you
down to the bottom of the water

144
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:25,679
and roll you over and over
till you stop kicking.

145
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,797
Then he'll take you away
to his meat safe,

146
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:33,840
a rock ledge or log down
under the water and jam you under it,

147
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,645
tenderise you a bit, good eating.

148
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:42,723
He wasn't happy with his grip on me,
so he let go to get a better one.

149
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:45,758
- I talked him out of it.
- Talked?

150
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:59,561
And you were just out here fishing?

151
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:05,001
Well, barramundi is a bloody big fish.

152
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,201
It'll be getting dark soon.

153
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:11,801
I'll take you
to where I camped the first night.

154
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:37,962
- You married?
- Was once... to the original rebel.

155
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:41,680
- What happened?
- You name it, we marched.

156
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:45,400
Anti-nuke, Women's Lib,
Save the Whales...

157
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:48,682
He's probably marching right now
for the gay Nazis.

158
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:53,123
- Sounds like a prize ratbag.
- He meant well.

159
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,600
Haven't you ever
protested anything?

160
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:58,763
Sure, every time
I get thrown out of the pub.

161
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:04,523
I'm serious. Where would you stand
on, say, the nuclear debate?

162
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:07,723
- What about the arms race?
- None of my business.

163
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:11,478
None of your business?
How can you say that?

164
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,962
It's everybody's business.

165
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:18,723
Got to have an opinion,
got to have a voice.

166
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:24,801
Who's gonna hear it out here?

167
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:28,560
OK, something closer to home.

168
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:35,004
The Aborigines, what about
their claims to get the land back?

169
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:39,204
Well, you see,
Aborigines don't own the land.

170
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,239
They belong to it.
It's like their mother.

171
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:50,284
See those rocks sticking up there.
Been standing there for 600 million years.

172
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,880
Still be there when you and I are gone.

173
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,844
So arguing over who owns them...

174
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:02,233
...is like two fleas arguing over
who owns the dog they live on.

175
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:08,001
You see, Aborigines,
like all God's creatures,

176
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:12,721
they just want the right to roam
across the Earth and be left in peace.

177
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,001

Oh, yeah, deadly. Not bad eating,
but they always give me gas.

Listen, are there any more
of those around?

181

Maybe the odd one late at night, but
stick close to me, you'll be all right.

182
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:07,240
You're probably right,
a man should have an opinion...

183
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:09,441
- Sh!
- What?

184
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:13,278

fire a couple of shots in the air.

You were right.
Definitely no place for a city girl.

228
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:58,684
From what Wal's told me, living
in the city can be just as dangerous.

- Never been to a city.

- You're kidding?
- No.

231
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:10,003
Cities are crowded, right? If I went and
lived in a city, I'd only make it worse.

232
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,201
Here, try this.

- It's just a scratch.

Oh, Mick! You frightened shit
out of me!

wandering around the scrub?

246
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:31,162
I'm on my way to a corroboree
at the Jabba. A bloody drag.

if I don't show up.

it'll take your spirit away?

- Bye, Nev.

- I'll catch up with you, Nev.
- What's happening?

255
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:08,360
I'd better go with Nev
and see the Pintinjarra.

256
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:09,998
Can I come?

257
00:34:10,205 --> 00:34:14,562
No way. Women are
strictly taboo at these turnouts.

How does he find his way in the dark?

306
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:10,644
Well... A man should
broaden his horizons.

307
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:19,283
Everything OK?

308
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:21,919
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no worries.

309
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:41,959
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

310
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:08,201
Sue!

311
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:11,280
Sue! Sue...

312
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:13,841
G'day, mate!

313
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:20,482
You look absolutely stunning.

314
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,562
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

315
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:27,721
Let me get this.

316
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:31,480
Where's the man
from the backwoods?

317
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:33,960
We got separated at Customs.

318
00:42:34,205 --> 00:42:38,164
He almost started a riot when they
wanted to look through his suitcase.

319
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,361
There he is!

320
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:43,523
So that's Jungle Jim?

321
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:18,724
<i>New York City, Mr Dundee.</i>
<i>Home to seven million people.</i>

322
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:23,760
<i>Incredible. Imagine seven million</i>
<i>people all wanting to live together.</i>

323
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:29,201
Yeah, New York must be
the friendliest place on Earth.

324
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:43,119
G'day!

325
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:47,520
Mick Dundee from Australia.
How are you?

326
00:43:47,765 --> 00:43:50,802
- I'm fine, how are you?
- Good.

327
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:55,084
I'm in town for a couple of days.
Probably see you around.

328
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:56,718
Bye.

329
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,281
Thank you, Gus.

330
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:27,437
You'll take care of the luggage?

331
00:44:31,365 --> 00:44:33,242
That's it.

332
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:38,682
- Thanks for the lift, mate.
- No problem.

333
00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:43,441
- What tribe are you, Gus?
- Tribe? Man, I ain't from no tribe.

334
00:44:43,925 --> 00:44:47,122
- You're a black fella, aren't you?
- Last time I looked.

335
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:53,404
No one in our tribe's got a flash car
like this. You must be doing all right.

336
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:03,320
Do you want to eat
somewhere special tonight?

337
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:08,883
- I thought Tacano's would be nice.
- Tacano's? 7.30?

338
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:11,804
- Bye.
- OK. Table for three.

339
00:45:40,725 --> 00:45:42,681
Sir?

340
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:46,201
No worries.

341
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,998
Well, what do you think?

342
00:46:04,205 --> 00:46:07,242
It's a bit rough, but I'll manage.

343
00:46:08,085 --> 00:46:11,521
Hey, how many of us
are staying here?

344
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:15,724
Just you. I've got
my own apartment downtown.

345
00:46:25,085 --> 00:46:27,883
Sorry, Mick Dundee.
I didn't catch the name.

346
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,360
- Angelo.
- Pleased to meet you, Angelo.

347
00:46:30,565 --> 00:46:33,921
I got it. Here you go.

348
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:42,724
- Got to pay for the room in advance?
- You're in my town now, trust me.

349
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:51,319
<i>Can I get the direct</i>
<i>dialling code for Australia?</i>

350
00:46:57,605 --> 00:47:01,200
You should be comfortable.
There's a TV if you get bored.

351
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:06,200
Ah, TV. Yeah, I saw that
at Darkie Johnson's place years ago.

352
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:15,718
Yep, that's what I saw.

353
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:20,880
Right. OK, thanks.

354
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:26,119
I'm writing down Wally's number
and my office number.

355
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:29,641
<i>Hey, Sue, come here, look at this!</i>

356
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:37,798
Some nitwit's put two dunnies in here.

357
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:39,723
One dunny, one bidet.

358
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,322
Bidday?

359
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:47,564
It's for... after you... you know...

360
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:53,641
You figure it out.

361
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:57,605
- See you at seven.
- Yeah.

362
00:48:28,565 --> 00:48:30,476
(LOUD WHISTLE)

363
00:48:32,845 --> 00:48:36,758
For washing your backside, right?

364
00:48:53,445 --> 00:48:54,719
G'day.

365
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:09,639
G'day.

366
00:49:10,725 --> 00:49:12,761
G'day. G'day.

367
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:22,723
- G'day.
- Hello.

368
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:24,719
G'day.

369
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:44,523
I'm sorry.

370
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,037
G'day.

371
00:49:50,805 --> 00:49:52,079
Shit!

372
00:50:57,885 --> 00:51:00,638
- Take it easy, Mick.
- Thanks, mate.

373
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:06,638
- G'day.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:51:19,165 --> 00:51:22,202
Good evening. Follow me, please.

375
00:51:25,965 --> 00:51:27,717
Hello.

376
00:51:27,925 --> 00:51:30,883
Sorry we're late. Been waiting long?

377
00:51:31,085 --> 00:51:34,600
I arrived early,
eager to spend time with my girl.

378
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:39,560
So, what are we drinking? Two vodka
martinis, and what's yours, Crocodile?

379
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,241
Yeah, I'll have two of those,
and a beer, thanks.

380
00:51:43,485 --> 00:51:47,842
Could you send them through
to our table, man?

381
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:53,921
- You <i>have</i> been here a while.
- Let's eat.

382
00:51:56,965 --> 00:52:02,961
This'll be quite a novelty for you, eating
something without having to kill it first.

383
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:06,322
Shall we? Ah, Roberto!

384
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:11,685
Good evening, Mr Mason, I can see
you've got some friends. Follow me.

385
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:18,321
Thank you.

386
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:29,282
I had almost forgotten
what a sexy-Iooking lady you are.

387
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:34,041
I'm gonna have to find a way
of keeping you in town.

388
00:52:37,325 --> 00:52:43,275
- You two should really be alone.
- Sorry, it's been six weeks.

389
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:47,484
- That's all the more reason...
- It's your first night in New York.

390
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:52,241
- Richard and I want you with us.
- Right, absolutely.

391
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:56,319
New York is no place
for a... country gent.

392
00:52:57,365 --> 00:53:03,315
Ain't no crocodiles out there, but a fast
movin' Chevy sure make a mess of you.

393
00:53:09,965 --> 00:53:11,762
What's your game?

394
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:16,080
Great. I'm starving.

395
00:53:16,325 --> 00:53:22,002
<i>Grazie, Roberto.</i>
<i>È stato piacere un rivederti.</i>

396
00:53:22,245 --> 00:53:24,998
<i>Bravissimo, lei parla</i>
<i>molto bene Italiano.</i>

397
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:30,801
Thank you. Perhaps I should order
for all of us, all right?

398
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:35,721
I don't imagine that they have any...
kangaroo steak or possum grits!

399
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:39,804
Don't worry, Mick can make
a gourmet meal out of anything.

400
00:53:40,365 --> 00:53:42,959
Even medium rare goanna.

401
00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:47,204
It was great, wasn't it?
And what about the yams?

402
00:53:47,405 --> 00:53:49,521
They were great.

403
00:53:49,765 --> 00:53:53,883
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

404
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:59,561
So, as he's our guest, perhaps
he'd like to order for all of us.

405
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:02,598
Wait a minute, I'll do that.

406
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:06,083
No, it's all right. I'll have a lash.

407
00:54:11,565 --> 00:54:13,760
- Italian, eh?
- Yes.

408
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:26,921
I dunno what you call it, but I like
the look of what that fat sheila's eating.

409
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:33,680
Richard!

410
00:54:33,925 --> 00:54:35,438
He OK?

411
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:39,079
Can't handle his drink, poor fella.

412
00:54:50,445 --> 00:54:54,040
He said you hit him. You're not
in the pub in Walkabout Creek now.

413
00:54:54,845 --> 00:54:58,042
- He was being a pain.
- That's beside the point.

414
00:54:59,085 --> 00:55:02,964
- You're not serious about this lemon?
- Butt out, Dundee!

415
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:07,443
He had too much to drink.
Richard is warm, caring and I love him.

416
00:55:07,685 --> 00:55:10,882
Excuse me.
I think I'm gonna throw up.

417
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,399
God!

418
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:34,765
- You want a hand?
- No, I can handle it.

419
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,921
I'm fine.

420
00:55:39,445 --> 00:55:43,484
We've got a busy day tomorrow,
so get some sleep. I'll pick you up early.

421
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:45,641
- Goodnight.
- Night.

422
00:55:53,445 --> 00:55:57,199
- Take me to the boozer.
- Boozer? Don't know that one.

423
00:55:58,205 --> 00:56:01,322
Pub, somewhere to get a drink.
Want to join me?

424
00:56:01,565 --> 00:56:05,524
- I just finished my shift, why not?
- Fancy a drink, do you?

425
00:56:05,765 --> 00:56:11,283
You kiddin'? I'm Italian,
I'd drink you under the table any day.

426
00:56:11,485 --> 00:56:13,840
That could be interesting.

427
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:25,201
I'm not putting down
your black widow spider.

428
00:56:25,445 --> 00:56:31,680
But the funnel web spider can kill in
eight seconds, just by looking at you.

429
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:37,044
But the real danger down there is
the sharks, the big ones, like 'Jaws'.

430
00:56:37,245 --> 00:56:41,682
I caught one 3 weeks ago, opened it,
you know what we found inside it?

431
00:56:41,925 --> 00:56:45,281
Three Filipino fishermen...
still in their boat!

432
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,682
Buzzy! Come on over,
meet this guy from Australia!

433
00:56:50,325 --> 00:56:52,680
Hey, my man, what's happening?

434
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:55,843
- Where?
- What's going down, bro?

435
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:59,962
Going down?
Just blowing the froth off a couple.

436
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:03,565
All right! Hang loose, my man!

437
00:57:04,845 --> 00:57:08,884
- Flat out like a lizard drinking.
- Say what?

438
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,161
What?

439
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:20,798
- He's cool!
- Yeah. I'm cool. I'm cool.

440
00:57:28,885 --> 00:57:31,319
- All right!
- All right!

441
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:37,604
He's a nice fella.
Here's my little Italian mate Danny!

442
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:41,201
Just in time to buy another round.
What are you drinking, Gwendoline?

443
00:57:41,405 --> 00:57:46,081
No more for me, thanks, Mick,
I must be getting on home.

444
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:48,958
Where's home, sweetie?

445
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,840
Just around the corner. I have a little
place where I live all by my Ionesome.

446
00:57:53,085 --> 00:57:56,600
- Not now.
- Most of the time, that is.

447
00:57:56,845 --> 00:57:59,962
Must get a bit Ionely?

448
00:58:00,205 --> 00:58:04,244
- Hanker for a bit of male company?
- Do I ever.

449
00:58:06,285 --> 00:58:08,879
Excuse me, Gwendoline.
Don't go away, love.

450
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:17,524
I've been trying to tell you all night,
that girl... she's a guy!

451
00:58:17,725 --> 00:58:20,319
A man dressed up as a girl!

452
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:24,721
- Nah, nah...
- A fag, for Chrissakes!

453
00:58:28,325 --> 00:58:30,281
I swear.

454
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:48,959
Hey! That was a guy!
A guy dressed up like a sheila!

455
00:58:49,165 --> 00:58:54,000
Look at that! Hey, you all knew,
you pack of bastards.

456
00:59:02,885 --> 00:59:06,082
- Where the hell did I leave the cab?
- Dunno.

457

You wait here
till I go look for it, Mick.

458
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:36,562
G'day, girls.
Mick Dundee from Australia.

459
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:43,483
- Lookin' for a good time, honey?
- Always lookin' for a good time.

460
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:52,759
Either of you ladies attached
or married or anything?

461
00:59:54,285 --> 00:59:57,004
No, we're both single ladies.

462
01:00:01,485 --> 01:00:04,363
This is Karla, I'm Simone.
Where you from, honey?

463
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:09,084
From Walkabout Creek
in the Northern Territory.

464
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:12,322
You probably don't know where that is.

465
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:17,360
Hey! I do. You're the guy
I've been reading about in the paper.

466
01:00:17,605 --> 01:00:20,438
The crocodile man,
I've been reading about him.

467
01:00:20,645 --> 01:00:26,402
He's like a regular Tarzan...
wrestles crocodiles, eats snakes...

468
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:30,603
Is this your first trip to New York?

469
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:36,723
- First trip anywhere.
- Well, hell!

470
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,758
We might just have
to give you one for free.

471
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:43,401
Yeah...

472
01:00:44,805 --> 01:00:46,921
One what?

473
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:59,044
We could take in a movie
or go to a dance or...

474
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:04,279
Hey, girls, girls! Are we working tonight
or are we socialising?

475
01:01:04,525 --> 01:01:06,561
Hey, pal!

476
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:10,682
I was just talking to the ladies,
and making a bit of progress.

477
01:01:11,365 --> 01:01:16,280
Are you gonna talk all night
or are you gonna screw one of them?

478
01:01:22,405 --> 01:01:26,444
Sorry, but if you stand around
out the front of a place like this,

479
01:01:26,685 --> 01:01:30,200
you're gonna hear
that kind of bad language.

480
01:01:30,405 --> 01:01:32,999
Nice chatting to you, ladies.

481
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:36,959
Danny, you're in no condition
to drive. Hop in, mate!

482
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,441
That's why you have
so many accidents here.

483
01:01:41,685 --> 01:01:46,122

on the wrong side of the car!

The towels for señor Mick.

you're back, how wonderful!

- Fran, how are you?
- Couldn't be better.

Tell me, who's the new man?

This is the man I'm writing about,
Mick Dundee.

Pleased to meet you.

- Maybe I'd better go there some day.

Darling, I'm so glad you could come!
Excuse me.

- Blocked nose, right.

- There's a better way of doing it.
- Better way?

Yep.

- It's a drug. You sniff it.

- Well, to get a buzz.

Mick, give him your wallet.

569
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,844
- What for?
- He's got a knife.

570
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:34,040
That's not a knife.

571

God, that sounds corny!

Why do you always make me feel
like Jane in the Tarzan comic?

That's what we ran
while you were Down Under.

to get my mind in gear.

When you were away,
I did some thinking.

It's time I made some concrete plans.

01:16:34,445 --> 01:16:38,563
I believe I am deeply in your debt
for saving my daughter's life.

612
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:42,599
Buy me a cold beer
and we'll call it quits.

613
01:16:42,805 --> 01:16:46,320
- Nice joint you got here.
- It keeps the rain off our heads.

614
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:51,593
Come, I want you to meet
some people. A drink for Mr Dundee.

615
01:16:54,365 --> 01:16:56,481
- My Dawn.
- How are you?

616
01:16:56,685 --> 01:16:58,721
Dorothy and Wendell Wainwright.
From Australia.

617
01:16:59,405 --> 01:17:03,159
- Nice to meet you, Wendell.
- Mike, have a drink.

618
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:06,163
Are you involved in cattle,
Mr Dundee?

619
01:17:06,365 --> 01:17:09,562
- Yeah, mostly buffaloes.
- Do you breed them?

620
01:17:09,765 --> 01:17:13,883
- No, I just toss 'em.
- And how are you finding New York?

621
01:17:14,085 --> 01:17:19,842
A bit of a lunatic asylum, eh?
That's why I love it, 'cause I fit right in.

622
01:17:20,085 --> 01:17:24,363
If you'll excuse me, I'd like Mick
to say hello to Senator Manly.

623
01:17:24,605 --> 01:17:27,802
- It was nice meeting you.
- See you later.

624
01:17:28,045 --> 01:17:31,082
- Seems like a personable fellow.
- What a strange...

625
01:17:31,325 --> 01:17:32,724
Nice people.

626
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:36,600
Dorothy's fine now,
but she used to be really uptight.

627
01:17:36,805 --> 01:17:40,764
- What happened?
- She found a wonderful shrink.

628
01:17:41,005 --> 01:17:42,961
Psychiatrist.

629
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:49,445
I shouldn't have made that crack
about the lunatic asylum.

630
01:17:49,685 --> 01:17:53,598
- I didn't know she was nuts.
- Of course she's not nuts!

631
01:17:53,805 --> 01:17:56,717
People go to a psychiatrist
to talk about their problems.

632
01:17:56,925 --> 01:18:00,679
She just needed to unload them.
Bring them out in the open.

633
01:18:00,925 --> 01:18:02,961
Hasn't she got any mates?

634
01:18:03,165 --> 01:18:06,840
You're right. Guess we could
all use more mates.

635
01:18:07,085 --> 01:18:09,963
Suppose you don't have any shrinks
at Walkabout Creek?

636
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:12,838
Back there, if you've got a problem,
you tell Wally.

637
01:18:13,045 --> 01:18:16,958
He tells everyone in town, brings it out
in the open, no more problem.

638
01:18:18,245 --> 01:18:21,760
- I didn't think you could make it!
- Wendell, wonderful to see you.

639
01:18:21,965 --> 01:18:25,560
- I don't believe I know your daughter.
- Oh, stop it!

640
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:39,241
Ladies and gentlemen! Friends!

641
01:18:39,485 --> 01:18:41,680
Welcome home, Sue!

642
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:43,881
(APPLAUSE)

643
01:18:45,965 --> 01:18:49,082
As you can see,
we're all glad to have you back.

644
01:18:49,285 --> 01:18:51,480
Of course, no one more than I.

645
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:54,444
I guess everyone in this room...

646
01:18:54,645 --> 01:18:59,161
...knows how this beautiful lady and I
feel about each other.

647
01:18:59,365 --> 01:19:01,560
Sue's come back to us.

648
01:19:01,765 --> 01:19:04,404
Delivered literally
out of the jaws of death

649
01:19:04,605 --> 01:19:08,723
by our new-found friend,
Mr Michael J. Dundee.

650
01:19:09,765 --> 01:19:12,404
A man to whom I am doubly indebted.

651
01:19:12,605 --> 01:19:14,960
Not only did he bring back
to me the woman that I love,

652
01:19:15,205 --> 01:19:18,800
but he increased
the paper's circulation in the process!

653
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:24,044
Sam said to me earlier,
"You're her editor!

654
01:19:24,245 --> 01:19:27,601
"Can't you stop her from taking
these dangerous assignments?"

655
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:32,242
Obviously I have not had much
success influencing her as her editor.

656
01:19:32,485 --> 01:19:36,398
Perhaps I'll have more success
as her husband.

657
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:39,642
- If she'll have me.
- Oh, Richard!

658
01:20:01,645 --> 01:20:06,480
- Congratulations.
- Couldn't be happier, Senator.

659
01:20:07,525 --> 01:20:09,800
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.

660
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:33,122
I'll get in the back, Gus.

661
01:20:49,005 --> 01:20:51,360
To the hotel, Mick?

662
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:54,039
Yeah, by way of a liquor store.

663
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:01,998
For medicinal purposes.

664
01:21:03,685 --> 01:21:05,482
Thanks, mate.

665
01:21:26,205 --> 01:21:28,639
(GUS) Hey! Take care now!

666
01:21:48,645 --> 01:21:50,044
Hey, buddy!

667
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:57,562
- Get it into you, Pop.
- God bless you. You saved my life.

668
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:09,841
Hey, Simone!

669
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:19,640
- You want some action?
- Thought you were somebody else.

670
01:22:21,965 --> 01:22:27,085
Well, if it ain't the man who don't like
bad fuckin' language in front of ladies.

671
01:22:27,645 --> 01:22:32,560
What's the matter, Aussie boy?
You gonna hop away like a kangaroo?

672
01:22:51,685 --> 01:22:54,438
I think it's time for a little tap dancing.

673
01:23:23,885 --> 01:23:25,841
You OK, Mick?

674
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:31,523
Oh, yeah, Gus, no worries.
I was just getting on top of them.

675
01:23:41,645 --> 01:23:44,523
You sure you're not Pintinjarra tribe?

676
01:23:44,725 --> 01:23:47,080
No, man, Harlem Warlords!

677
01:23:47,325 --> 01:23:49,759
I knew you were tribal.

678
01:23:57,605 --> 01:23:59,641
Mick Dundee's room, please.

679
01:24:00,405 --> 01:24:04,603
(TV DROWNS SOUND
OF PHONE RINGING)

680
01:24:14,485 --> 01:24:16,282
<i>Sorry, he's still not answering.</i>

681
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:19,363
He called down to say
he was checking out today.

682
01:24:19,565 --> 01:24:23,843
- <i>We're gonna miss him around here.</i>
- Thanks.

683
01:24:32,805 --> 01:24:34,761
Thank you, sir.

684
01:24:42,725 --> 01:24:44,761
G'day, Irving, how are you?

685
01:24:44,965 --> 01:24:47,798
- I wouldn't be dead for dollars.
- Close.

686
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:50,963
Are you leaving us, Mick?
You going back home?

687
01:24:51,205 --> 01:24:53,161
No, I thought I'd go Walkabout.

688
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:57,081
Wander around
and take a look at America.

689
01:24:57,965 --> 01:25:01,560
- For how long?
- Long as it takes.

690
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:06,964
- What's the quickest way out of town?
- There's a subway two blocks that way.

691
01:25:07,165 --> 01:25:11,363
- It'll take you to Grand Central Station.
- That'll do.

692
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:16,480
- Have a nice day, Oiving.
- No worries, mate.

693
01:25:44,285 --> 01:25:45,559
Morning, Miss.

694
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:48,958
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

695
01:25:49,165 --> 01:25:51,201
No, but it'll come to me.

696
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:55,080
If you're looking for Crocodile Mick,
he's gone Walkabout.

697
01:25:56,125 --> 01:26:00,084
- You don't know where?
- He's headed for the subway.

698
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,116
You'd better hurry.

699
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:04,202
Mind this for me.

700
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:13,679
Oh, Christ!

701
01:27:30,925 --> 01:27:33,200
Hey, lady, where you goin'?

702
01:27:33,445 --> 01:27:36,960
If you want to play,
why don't you play with me?

703
01:27:42,165 --> 01:27:45,282
Mick! Mick Dundee!

704
01:27:46,445 --> 01:27:47,844
OOWEE!

705
01:27:48,085 --> 01:27:49,359
What's up, lady?

706
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:53,362
I got to talk to that man
down there in the black hat.

707
01:27:57,645 --> 01:27:59,317
Hey!

708
01:28:02,765 --> 01:28:06,678
The lady here wants to talk
to the guy in the black hat!

709
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:09,960
Hey, fella!

710
01:28:10,205 --> 01:28:12,002
You in the hat!

711
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:15,402
The lady down the end
wants to see you!

712
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:18,441
What does she want?

713
01:28:19,165 --> 01:28:22,282
- What does she want?
- What do you want?

714
01:28:24,285 --> 01:28:26,719
Tell him not to leave.

715
01:28:26,965 --> 01:28:29,320
I'm not gonna marry Richard.

716
01:28:32,245 --> 01:28:35,840
Tell him, don't leave.
She's not gonna marry Richard!

717
01:28:37,965 --> 01:28:41,321
Don't leave.
I'm not gonna marry Richard.

718
01:28:43,565 --> 01:28:47,683
- Why not?
- I don't know. Why not?

719
01:28:48,885 --> 01:28:51,001
Why not?

720
01:28:52,245 --> 01:28:56,523
Tell him I love him. I love YOU!

721
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:00,081
I love you!

722
01:29:01,965 --> 01:29:03,921
I love you! I love...

723
01:29:05,485 --> 01:29:08,283
- She loves me.
- Well?

724
01:29:09,525 --> 01:29:12,403
Tell her I...
I'll tell her myself, I'm coming through!

725
01:29:13,485 --> 01:29:16,158
- He's coming through!
- He's coming through!

726
01:29:20,965 --> 01:29:23,320
It's too crowded here,
we're jammed in like sheep.

727
01:29:24,085 --> 01:29:25,996
Up, up, up...
