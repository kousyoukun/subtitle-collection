00:02:31.000-->00:02:34.000,
"中国国家安全部"

2
00:02:38.000 -->00:02:40.000,
"他们要派500个托卡列夫去朝鲜。
They’re sending 500 Tokarevs to North Korea."

3
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,990
Tokarevs吗?
Tokarevs?

4
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,580

5
确认一下。
Confirm it.

6
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,500
我明白了。

7
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,250

马上锁住它。
Lock it down at once.

8
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,210
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,130
你知道我是谁吗?
Do you know who I am?!

11
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,140
把手机给我!
Give me my phone!

12
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,010
我打个电话，你就…
One call from me, you’ll...

13
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,310
闭嘴!
Shut up!

14
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,230
党知道这一切。
The party knows all about it.

15
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,110
那些枪本来是要报废的
Those guns were to be scrapped,

16
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,440
有什么大不了的?
what’s the big deal?

17
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,070
朝鲜从未提出过这样的要求。
North Korea has never requested them.

18
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,660
那不可能!
That can’t be!

19
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,830
枪现在在哪里?
Where are the guns now?

20
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,990
它正在被运往韩国。
It’s being transported to South Korea.

21
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,830
我不知道!
I didn’t know!

22
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,870
我还以为他们要去北方呢!
I thought they were bound for the North!

23
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,210
不管怎么说,
Anyway,

24
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,750
我会打扫干净的!
I’ll clean it up!

25
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,090
释放我!
Release me!

26
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,640
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

27
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,430
我会带我的团队去韩国清理。
I’ll take my team and clean it up in South Korea.

28
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,980
你确定你可以秘密执行任务
You’re certain you can be covert carrying out this mission

29
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,570
你的整个团队都在吗?
with your entire team there?

30
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,570
如果你被抓了怎么办?
What if you get caught?

31
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,780
那么我们该怎么做呢?
How should we do this then?

32
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,660
把这个单独送过去。
Send this one over alone.

33
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,750
但她只是个实习生
But she’s just a trainee,

34
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,130
她要对付的是一个军火商。
she’ll be up against an arms dealer.

35
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,510
我知道!
I know!

36
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,840
所以我才派她去。
That’s why I’m sending her.

37
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,140
送她去死?
Sending her to die?

38
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,310
首席曹国伟。
Chief Chao.

39
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,390
他说，中国政府已经竭尽所能，
‘The Chinese government did all it can,

40
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,940
并在这个过程中失去了一位北京大学的年轻经纪人。
and lost a Beijing University grad young agent in the process.

41
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,480
韩国政府在此期间做了什么?”
What did the South Korean government do in the meantime?’

42
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,360
我们可以这样回应。
We can respond as such.

43
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,700
驳回了!
Dismissed!

44
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,990
先生。
Sir.

45
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,580
如果……
What if...

46
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,590
她完成任务了吗?
she accomplishes her mission?

47
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,920
如果她有那么多才华，我们就培养她。
If she is that talented, we’ll groom her.

48
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,140
但不要期望太多。
But don’t expect much.

49
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,180
她的任务就是去死。
Her mission is to go and die.

50
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:45,860
使命:成为可能
MISSION: POSSIBLE

51
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,430
私家侦探社
Dope Woo P.I. Agency

52
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,440
你关灯干什么?
What are you doing with the lights off?

53
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,560
嗯?
Huh?

54
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,110
我要去睡觉了。
I was going to get some shut eye.

55
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,740
什么风把你吹来了?
What brings you here?

56
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,070
坐下来。
Sit down.

57
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,700
想喝点什么吗?
Want something to drink?

58
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,410
我来过一会儿。
I stopped by for a sec.

59
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,300
我们换了医院。
We switched hospital.

60
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,180
但我接到了那个老家伙的电话。
But I got a call from the old one.

61
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,390
他们说有人付了钱。
They said someone paid the bill.

62
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,190
你不需要把这个还给我。
You don’t need to give this back.

63
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
我付钱是因为我做得很好。
I paid it because I’m doing well.

64
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,440
我最近超级忙。
I’m super busy lately.

65
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,320
胡国辉!
Mr. Woo!

66
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,530
你在吗?

67
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,870
灯早就熄灭了。

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,200
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

69
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,460
吴先生，事情已经失控了。
Mr. Woo, it’s getting out of hand.

70
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,540
昨天没有交房租。
The rent wasn’t deposited yesterday.

71
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,840
我一定要来这里领房租吗?
Do I always have to come here to get the rent?

72
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,130
那是不可能的。
That’s not possible.

73
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,340
这当然是可能的!
Of course it’s possible!

74
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,260
我知道你解雇了员工，现在…

75
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,970
哦!我存了一张支票。

76
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,650
你知道银行要花几天的时间来处理。
You know the bank takes a few days to get that processed.

77
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,900
好吧。

78
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,150
我明天可以跟银行核对一下。
I can check it with the bank tomorrow.

79
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,400
――照顾。――再见。

80
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,370
很多人用支票付我钱。

81
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,990

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
别担心我们。

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,650
唐人街，仁川，韩国

85
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,610

86
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,580
――说韩国人。――是的,先生。

87
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,090
喂?
Hello?

88
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,010
我没有忘记，我理解。

89
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,430

90
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,100
是我妻子，她订购了化妆品。

94
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,660
关于这次行动的所有情报都在平板电脑里，
All intel concerning this op is in the tablet,

95
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,830
如果发生什么事，给我打电话，不要发信息。

96
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,370

97
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,080
你不会得到任何支持

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,420
这是单独行动。

104

105
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,750
不好，我们一天比一天虚弱。

所以有什么事吗?

107
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,760
我想请你帮个非正式的忙。

110
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,110
你可能要求太多。
You may be asking too much.

111
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,530
我就能了解公司的坏一面。
I could get on my agency’s bad side.

112
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,150
我们会支付所有的费用。

113
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,950
这是一个给定的。

114
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,790
我给你介绍一个俄国线人。

119
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,350
如果你不相信，你还能相信谁?

我们救过彼此的命。

121

122
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,530
这是一个耳机。

123
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,570

124
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,910
职业危害。
Occupational hazard.

125
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,490
吻的时间!

家庭男人的秘密约会
Family men’s secret rendezvous

127
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,660
这也能被称为婚外情吗?

128
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,000
他们被接吻镜头曝光了!

129

我们为你欢呼!

130
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,510
300美元。

132
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,060
我和之前一样，转租了一个月。
I came to sublet this place for a month like before.

133
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,810

是的。

137
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,610
顺便说一下,

138
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,450
在你上次转租之后

139
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,410
我接到奇怪的电话，奇怪的人来过。
I got weird calls and weird people came by.

140
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,630

2000多美元。

有很多害虫。

144
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,760
当然，它会干净整洁的!

145
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,780
女士，你还好吗?
Ma’am, are you okay?

146
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,430
他为什么不来?
Why isn’t he coming?

147
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,680
我应该降价的……
I should’ve cheaped out...

148
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,110
我需要卖这些吗?
Do I need to sell these?

149
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,660

Don’t forget, don’t ever say you worked on this together.

151
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,700
明白,先生。

好吧……
Okay...

155
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,890
我可以……
I can...

156
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,780
什么风把你吹来了?
What brings you here?

157
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,200
你男朋友劈腿了?或跟踪你吗?
Your boyfriend cheating on you? Or stalking you?

158
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,750
你没接到电话?
You didn’t get a call?

159
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,290
什么叫?
What call?

160
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,130
我以为一切都安排好了。
I thought it was all arranged.

161
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,710
哦,从昨天!
Oh, from yesterday!

162
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,090
难道你不了解我的船长吗?
Don’t you know my captain well?

163
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,390
我想你可以这么说，但不是真的，
I guess you could say that, but not really,

164
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,100
我甚至不知道他的名字。

165
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,230
对，这说得通。

167
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,400
利用这个空间，除掉一些害虫。

168
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,610
这次不需要了。
That won’t be necessary this time.

169
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,450
这不是暗杀任务。
This isn’t an assassination mission.

170
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,620
我只需要收集一些情报让警察接手。
I just need to gather some intel and let the police take over.

171
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,870
暗杀?
Assassination?

172
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,080
-这是预付款。-有误会…
- Here’s the advance. - There’s misunderstanding...

173
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,080
误解?
Misunderstanding?

174
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,960
没什么。
It’s nothing.

175
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,430
我不是那种没有预付全薪就不工作的人……
I’m not someone who doesn’t work without a full pay upfront...

176
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,430
哦……
Oh...

177
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,100
那我能平分一万美元吗?
Then can I pay $10,000 in halves?

178
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,770
不，这些很重，我买了。
No, these are heavy, I’ll take them.

179
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,610
一点也不重。
They’re not heavy at all.

180
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,440
不,没关系!
No, it’s okay!

181
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,700
你叫吴素汉?
Your name is Woo Su-han?

182
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,830
是的。
Yes.

183
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,290
我得看起来像在这里工作的，所以我能叫你“老板”吗?
I need to look like I work here, so can I call you ‘boss’?

184
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,460
这有点太多了……
That’s a bit much...

185
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,290
“Chief”更合适。
‘Chief’ would be more appropriate.

186
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,750
好吧,局长。
Okay, chief.

187
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,760

190
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,850
好的,Da-hee。
Okay, Da-hee.

191
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,480
我不知道我到底是什么角色。
I didn’t hear about what my role is exactly.

192
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,640
我明白了。

193
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,480
简报室在哪里?
Where’s the briefing room?

简报室……
Briefing room...

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,270
在那里!

196

你想让我简要介绍一下吗?

197
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,110
为什么不呢?

198
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,320
这里的安全没有保障。
Security isn’t guaranteed here.

199
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,330
一切都很好，几乎没有人来。
It’s all good, barely anyone comes by.

200
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,800
我能把这些扔掉吗?
Can I throw these out?

201
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,050
什么?
What?

202
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,220
不!
No!

203
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,890

我等了很久才得到这张签名。

不，这是我收集的证据。
No, it’s a piece of evidence I collected.

214
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,560
你没有存任何支票!

租金为3个月。

216

223

我刚才说他是谁来着?

那是什么，他进口稀有物品。

但警察只有在有证据的时候才会介入。

当然，这是违法的。

281
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,730
我们所做的是违法的。
What we do is illegal.

282
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,730
那听起来不错。
That sounds right.

283
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,780
但是你会跳探戈吗?
But do you know how to tango?

284

290
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,880
我需要穿它去训练吗?

291
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,550
你游泳时不穿泳衣吗?

292
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
哦……
Oh...

293
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,470
呼出。
Breathe out.

294
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,350
一个,两个,三个……
One, two, three...

295
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,740
我能为您效劳吗?
Can I help you?

296
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,030
我想学探戈……
I want to learn tango...

297
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,990
哦……
Oh...

298
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,450
我们先做瑜伽，然后再上探戈课。
We do yoga first then tango lesson after.

299
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,170
你可以穿舒适的衣服。
And you can wear something comfy.

300
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,670
服装只用于比赛。
Dress is only for competitions.

301
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,170
我知道它…
I knew it...

302
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,180
你有什么要换的吗?
Do you have anything to change into?

303
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,140
――Da-hee ?――是吗?
- Da-hee? - Yes?

304
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,020
-别对我放屁。-给我闭嘴!
- Don’t fart on me. - Shut the hell up!

305
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,620
――你好!――你好!
- Hola! - Hola!

306
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,700
我晚了?
Am I late?

307
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,450
不，我们才刚开始。
No, we just started.

308
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,050
我们在一起是不可思议的。
We are incredible together.

309
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,920
――确定。――好。
- Sure. - Good.

310
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,810
等待……
Wait...

311
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,070
你的裙子真漂亮。
Your dress is spectacular.

312
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,720
紧急……
Emergency...

313
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,480
什么，翻盖手机吗?
What the, a flip phone?

314
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,150
来吧……
Come on...

315
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,030
寄来:全先生，现在联系不上你。
Sent: Mr. Jeon, you’re not reachable.

316
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,240
如果你今天不回答，我就报警。
If you don’t answer by today, I’ll call the police.

317
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,920
我的歉意。
My apologies.

318
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,700
噢我的天!
Oh my!

319
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,950
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

320
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,370
你还好吗，帕克先生?
Are you okay, Mr. Park?

321
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,750
我很好……
I’m fine...

322
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,420
是的，我在café。
Yeah, I’m at the café.

323
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,710
什么?你什么意思?
What? What do you mean?

324
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,970
你在干什么?!
What were you doing?!

325
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,650
朴先生!
Mr. Park!

326
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,820
李老师，请帮帮我!
Ms. Lee, please help!

327
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,000
911年?请派人帮忙，一个人倒下了。
911? Please send help, a man collapsed.

328
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,130
他已经死了，我们得走了。
He’s already dead, we need to go.

329
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,130
我们为什么要呢?
Why should we?

330
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,130
警察一来，事情就会变得一团糟。
Things will get messy when the police arrive.

331
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,970
不，现在走会起疑心的。
No, we’d be suspicious if we leave now.

332
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,890
你确定这样可以吗?
You sure this is okay?

333
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,220
我们什么都没做，别担心。
We didn’t do anything, don’t worry about it.

334
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,900
所以…你们两个认识吗?
So... do you two know each other?

335
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,940
――是的。――没有。
- Yes. - No.

336
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,280
你们到底认识不认识?
So do you know each other or not?

337
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
我们彼此不认识
We didn’t know each other,

338
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,200
但我们今天认识了，所以我们现在认识了。
but got acquainted today, so we do now.

339
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,910
今天开会……
Met today...

340
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,630
-吴素汉先生?――是吗?
- Mr. Woo Su-han? - Yes?

341
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,130
你开私人侦探事务所?
You run a private detective agency?

342
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,090
是的。
Yes.

343
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,210
你去探戈café是为了调查某人吗?
Were you at the tango café to investigate someone?

344
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,510
不，这是我的爱好，学习英语。
No, it’s my hobby, to learn it.

345
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,130
爱好……
Hobby...

346
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,300
还有Yoo Da-hee女士。
And Ms. Yoo Da-hee.

347
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,260
是吗?
Yes?

348
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,430
今天是你第一次上探戈课?
It was your first tango session today?

349
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,520
是的。
Yes.

350
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,940
但你们两个都盛装打扮…
But you two are all dressed up...

351
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,480
对吧?尴尬的,不是吗?
Right? Awkward, no?

352
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,570
她为什么盛装出席第一次治疗?
Why is she all dressed up to her first session?

353
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,650
与手套!
With gloves too!

354
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,700
至少把你的领结摘下来!
At least take your bow tie off!

355
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,250
但为什么要调查我们?
But why are we getting investigated?

356
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,330
因为人们觉得你们俩很可疑。
Because people thought you two were suspicious.

357
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,250
――谁?――每一个人。
- Who? - Everyone.

358
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,880
但这并不意味着我们会被指控犯罪。
But that doesn’t mean we’re charged with a crime.

359
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,680
没错，他的死因也是心脏病发作。
Right, and his cause of death was heart attack too.

360
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,600
-那我们能走了吗?――是的。
- So can we leave? - Yes.

361
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,890
谢谢你！
Thank you!

362
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,230
长官，他们是不是有点可疑?
Sir, aren’t they a bit suspicious?

363
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,690
你没有这样的经历，
You don’t have the experience to feel that way,

364
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,900
如果你变得像我一样，你会发展直觉。
if you become like me, you’ll develop intuition.

365
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,320
进一步研究这两个人。
Look into those two further.

366
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,620
先生?为什么?
Sir? Why?

367
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,240
他们发现了一些东西，我感到兴奋。
They got something, I’m getting tingly.

368
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,670
所以我们的工作结束了?
So our work’s done?

369
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,670
所以如何?
How so?

370
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,340
目标已经死了。
The target’s dead.

371
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,960
帕克肯定是被人利用后被杀的。
Park must’ve been used and killed afterwards.

372
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,760
拜托，你也听到了，是心脏病发作。
Come on, you heard him, it was a heart attack.

373
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,680
高剂量的氯化钾可以诱发这种症状，但不会产生任何痕迹。
High doses of potassium chloride could induce it with no trace.

374
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,680
你不知道吗?
You didn’t know?

375
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,350
我当然知道。
Of course I knew.

376
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,190
这意味着有专业人士参与其中。
It means professionals got involved.

377
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,150
所以我们应该报告此事，退后一步。
So we should report this and take a step back.

378
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,110
退一步做什么?
Step back from what?

379
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,240
如果你不想要这份工作，就把预付款退回去。
If you don’t want the job, return the advance.

380
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,870
我只是在考验你的毅力。
I was just testing your tenacity.

381
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,950
你才不会呢。
Like hell you did.

382
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,120
别告诉别人，我能听见。
Keep those words to yourself, I can hear them.

383
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,580
是吗，你克隆了手机吗?
Oh yeah, did you clone the phone?

384
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,790
它……是翻盖手机。
It... was a flip phone.

385
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,710
所以呢?你不能吗?
So? You couldn’t?

386
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,220
插头插错了!
It had the wrong plug!

387
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,800
你也没说过会是翻盖手机!
And you never said it was going to be a flip phone!

388
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,300
现在人人都在用智能手机。
Everyone uses smartphones now.

389
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,180
那通话记录呢?
What about the call logs?

390
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,470
我看到了。
I saw.

391
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,180
他给一个叫Mr。全的最近,
He texted someone called ‘Mr. Jeon’ recently,

392
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,480
如果联系不到全，他就会报警。
he was going to call the cops if Jeon wasn’t reachable.

393
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,690
你记住号码了吗?
Did you memorize the number?

394
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,320
你没有吗?
You didn’t?

395
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,360
他们都用一次性手机，为什么还要记?
They all use burner phones, why bother memorizing it?

396
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,990
军火商肯定用燃烧器，为什么要用自己的?
Arms dealer must use burners, why’d he use his own?

397
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,530
我们今天到底做了什么?
So what the hell did we do today?

398
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,460
顺便问一下，我应该在哪里下车?
By the way, where should I drop you off?

399
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,630
在车站前面。
In front of the station.

400
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,040
――哪个站?――Daerim。
- Which station? - Daerim.

401
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,340
那太远了!
That’s too far!

402
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,750
那你为什么要问?
So why did you ask?

403
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,880
我以为你会说"最近的地铁站"
I thought you’d say “Closest subway station”!

404
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,680
我怎么能穿成这样坐地铁?
How could I hop on a subway in this?

405
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,340
那你为什么穿成那样?
So why did you dress like that?

406
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,260
我穿成这样是因为某人!
I dressed like this because of someone!

407
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,390
是关于和我一起工作的探员。
It’s about the agent I’m working with.

408
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,520
我觉得他不是特工。
I don’t think he’s an agent.

409
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,480
这就是他的天赋，没人知道他是特工。
That’s his talent, no one knew he was an agent.

410
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,740
他的代号是Ama Zing是有原因的。
His codename is Ama Zing for a reason.

411
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,320
我明白了。
I understand.

412
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,590
所以他没有任何身份证明吗?
So he had no ID or anything to identify him?

413
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,550
不，他一无所有
No, he had nothing,

414
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,590
他的手机也没有记录。
and his phone had no records.

415
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,840
顺便说一下,
By the way,

416
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,510
我想我最近见过他。
I think I saw him recently.

417
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
在哪里?
Where?

418
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,680
在YouTube上。
On YouTube.

419
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,930
他在和一个男人接吻，
He was on a Kiss Cam with a guy,

420
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,850
还在棒球赛上出柜了。
and outed as a gay at the baseball game.

421
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,190
它在网上走红。
It went viral online.

422
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:07,200
所以他试图撞到车里自杀?
So he attempted suicide by running into traffic?

423
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,240
这听起来似是而非的。
That sounds plausible.

424
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,830
这是不正确的……
That’s not right...

425
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,920
无论如何我都要救这个人。
I’m going to save this man no matter what.

426
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,340
坚持下去..
Hang in there.

427
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,340
你为什么迟到?
Why are you late?

428
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,130
工作,很明显。
Working, obviously.

429
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,930
丢失的小狗
Lost Puppy

430
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,260
我们也要这么做吗?
We have to do this too?

431
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,640
我们得到了报酬，所以是的。
We got paid, so yeah.

432
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,270
好吧。
All right.

433
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,900
你为什么在这里?我以为我们结束了。
Why are you here? I thought we were done.

434
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,820
你没看新闻吗?
You didn’t see the news?

435
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,200
牛仔黑帮老大被枪杀了。

436
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,990
昨晚。
Last night.

437
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,540
得到他!
Get him!

438
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,920
然后呢?
Then what?

439
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,630
街上已经有枪了吗?
Guns are already on the streets?

440
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,010
这就是我们要查的。
That’s what we have to find out.

441
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,180
你认识和那个世界有联系的人吗?
Do you know anyone who’s connected to that world?

442
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,140
“那个世界”?
“That world”?

443
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,890
是的，暴徒和帮派。
Yeah, mobs and gangs.

444
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,100
我怎么知道，警察应该知道。
How do I know that, cops should though.

445
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,230
如果你不想工作，就把预付款掏出来。
If you don’t feel like working, cough up the advance.

446
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,730
我认识一位这方面的专家。
I know an expert in that world.

447
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,280
然后我们走吧!
Then let’s go!

448
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,240
它需要钱，这就是原因。
It costs money, that’s why.

449
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,070
多少钱?
How much?

450
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,160
2000美元。
$2,000.

451
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,540
在这里。
Here.

452
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,080
你确定吗?
You sure about this?

453
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,300
完全确定，他就像个算命先生。
Totally sure, he’s like a fortune teller.

454
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,260
好久不见了。
It’s been so long.

455
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,930
是的。
Yup.

456
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,510
我们真的遇到了一个真正的算命先生?
We actually came to a real fortune teller?

457
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,980
他在黑帮里很有名，是个圈内人。
He’s famous among gangsters, he’s an insider.

458
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,770
今天什么风把你吹来了?
What brings you here today?

459
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,440
你的性兼容性?
Your sexual compatibility?

460
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,360
――不!――不!
- No! - No!

461
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,030
你确定吗?
You sure?

462
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,320
你们俩会制造一股旋风。
You two will create a whirlwind.

463
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,570
忘记这一点。
Forget that.

464
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,870
你最近听说过牛仔竞技会的事吗?
Did you hear anything about Rodeo mob lately?

465
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,620
你为什么这么问?!
Why do you ask?!

466
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,210
这只是1950美元。
That’s only $1,950.

467
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,170
在这儿。
Here it is.

468
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,840
他太厉害了，他马上就知道了。
He’s so good, he knew right away.

469
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,720
你的麻烦制造者。
You troublemaker.

470
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,480
牛仔竞技俱乐部的老大突然跑来问我，
Rodeo mob boss dropped in out of the blue to ask me,

471
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,690
他是否注定要死于一颗子弹。
whether he was destined to die with a bullet.

472
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,480
你跟他说了什么?
What did you tell him?

473
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,400
我告诉他那是不可能的。
I told him that’d never happen.

474
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,740
有人在韩国中枪的几率
The chance of someone getting shot in Korea

475
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,070
就像被闪电击中一样。
is about the same as getting hit by a lightning.

476
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,120
这是常识。
That’s common sense.

477
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,670
哦，不，不，不!
Oh no, no, no!

478
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,330
神圣的狗屎!我受骗的!
Holy shit! I’m so fucked!

479
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,590
你还听到什么了吗?
Did you hear anything else?

480
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,670
罗迪欧是否试图获得枪支?
Whether Rodeo was trying to acquire guns?

481
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,720
那从未发生!
That’d never happen!

482
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,050
Rodeo对江南区有很强的把握。
Rodeo has a firm grasp of Gangnam district.

483
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,140
他们为什么故意让警察瞄准?
Why’d they intentionally get on the cops’ crosshair?

484
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,310
他们可以泄露对手的情报
They can leak intel on their rivals

485
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,520
利用警察的优势。
and use the cops to their advantage.

486
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,070
合法地和你的对手上床是最好的办法!
Screwing your rivals legally is the best way!

487
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,860
他是对的!
He’s right!

488
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,990
没有必要争夺地盘。
There’s no need for turf wars.

489
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:39,490
在朝鲜没有任何帮派战争!
There aren’t any gang wars in Korea!

490
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
,只有一个除外。
Except one.

491
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,410
斧头家族。
The Axe clan.

492
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,910
斧族吗?
Axe clan?

493
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,380
他们是邪恶的帮派，不像其他帮派。
They’re a vicious clan, unlike other gangs.

494
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,800
他们跟一个中国黑帮混在一起，
They got mixed up with a Chinese gang,

495
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,340
他们完全接管了。
and they completely took over.

496
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:01,260
如果是他们干的，一切皆有可能。
If it was them, anything is possible, yup.

497
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,970
来吧，来吧。
Bring it, bring it.

498
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,350
我很渴。
I’m so thirsty.

499
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,230
为什么这么酸?
Why is this so sour?

500
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,200
这饮料过期了!
This drink is expired!

501
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:22,030
孩子，果汁过期了，扔掉，好吗?
Kiddo, the juice is expired, throw them out, all right?

502
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,960
我们最好查查阿克斯家族。
We better look into the Axe clan.

503
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,460
斧族吗?
Axe clan?

504
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,340
走私者可能为了卖枪而发动一场帮派战争。
The smugglers may start a gang war in order to sell guns.

505
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,420
如果罗迪欧不让步，他们会煽动阿克斯家族。
If Rodeo won’t budge, they’ll agitate the Axe clan.

506
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,720
你疯了吗? !你听说过他!
Are you nuts?! You heard him!

507
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,600
他说他们很邪恶!
He said they’re vicious!

508
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,770
作为一个经验丰富的专家，你真是个胆小鬼。
You sure are a chicken for a seasoned expert.

509
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,730
我不相信。
I don’t believe it.

510
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,640
不是因为我是个胆小鬼
It’s not that I’m a chicken,

511
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,270
我只是不喜欢让一个业余爱好者跟着我。
I’m just not a fan of having an amateur tagging along.

512
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,530
别担心我，我能照顾好自己。
Don’t worry about me, I can take care of myself.

513
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,240
你学过拳击饮食吗?
Did you learn boxing diet or something?

514
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,490
拳击的饮食吗?
Boxing diet?

515
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,950
要我指给你看吗?
Should I show you?

516
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,830
天啊，好吧，给我看看。
Jeez, all right, show me.

517
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,330
如果我打了你，我们就去找阿克斯家族。
If I hit you, we’re going to the Axe clan.

518
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,080
很好,继续。
Fine, go ahead.

519
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,130
环路和街道完全不一样。
The ring and the street are completely dif...

520
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,680
你想让我打你。
You wanted me to hit you.

521
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,430
我让你打了我。
I let you hit me.

522
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,390
血迹吗?
Any blood stains?

523
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,530
我们是重案组的。
We’re from Major Crimes.

524
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,330
我之前已经跟警察谈过了。
I already talked to cops earlier.

525
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,660
不是我们。
That it wasn’t us.

526
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,920
最近有军火商来过吗?
Did an arms dealer come by recently?

527
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,380
不。
Nope.

528
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,250
我们已经逮捕了那个毒贩。
We’ve arrested that dealer.

529
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,260
那你为什么不去问他?
Why don’t you go ask him then?

530
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,970
如果你不合作，我们会逮捕你。
If you’re uncooperative, we will arrest you.

531
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,600
你有逮捕令吗?
Do you have an arrest warrant?

532
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,350
帮派暴力是一部特殊的法律，所以不需要。
Gang violence is a special law, so it doesn’t need one.

533
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
不知道。
Didn’t know.

534
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,940
我受够了，把他铐起来，我们去警局审问他。
I’ve had it, cuff him, we’ll interrogate him at the station.

535
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,440
袖口他吗?
Cuff him?

536
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,990
――是的,手铐。-我没有
- Yes, handcuffs. - I don’t have one.

537
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,410
你的头在哪里?
Where’s your head at!

538
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,750
你怎么能不带一双来!
How could you not bring a pair?!

539
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,630
这是什么?
What’s this?

540
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,090
嫌疑人抱怨手铐伤害了他们的手腕，
Suspects complained that handcuffs were hurting their wrists,

541
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,350
所以我们在测试这对新鞋。
so we’re testing this new pair.

542
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,310
世界已经改善了，不是吗?
The world has improved, no?

543
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,100
保护罪犯的公民权利。
Protecting civil rights of criminals too.

544
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,860
你不应该先给我读米兰达警告吗?
Shouldn’t you read me the Miranda warning first?

545
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,150
米兰达警告?
Miranda warning?

546
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,360
这不是在医学院做的吗?
Isn’t that done in medical school?

547
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,650
希波克拉底誓言。
That’s Hippocratic Oath.

548
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,820
米兰达警告，我知道。
Right, Miranda warning, I know.

549
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,740
你有权指定一名检察官。
You have the right to appoint a prosecutor.

550
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,500
――律师。――我知道。
- Lawyer. - I know.

551
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,870
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

552
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,210
你们俩不是警察，对吧?
You two aren’t cops, right?

553
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,580
――没有。――是的。
- No. - Yes.

554
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,150
快点!
Hurry!

555
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,200
我们走吧!
Let’s go!

556
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,780
――首席?――是吗?
- Chief? - Yes?

557
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,170
- Da-hee…――是吗?
- Da-hee... - Yes?

558
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,500
你去吧…
You go ahead...

559
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,880
我怎么能离开你呢?
How could I leave you?

560
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,380
我没事，你继续…
I’m okay, you go on...

561
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,260
到底是什么?
What the heck?

562
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,390
那不是你流鼻血的污渍吗?
Isn’t that your nosebleed smudge?

563
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,350
什么?
What?

564
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,730
该死的!
Dammit!

565
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,730
垃圾……
Crap...

566
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,080
你怎么这么久才来!
What took you so long!

567
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
去你的!
Screw you!

568
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,040
很好。
Very good.

569
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,220
这些家伙真是疯了。
These guys really are insane.

570
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,230
他们怎么能在朝鲜使用枪支?
How could they wield guns in Korea?

571
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,730
我差点就死了……
I almost died back there...

572
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,810
你认识黑客吗?
Do you know any hackers?

573
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,810
黑客吗?对什么?
Hackers? What for?

574
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,190
我们得解开这个。
We have to unlock this.

575
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,320
没必要解锁，我们不再需要它了。
No need to unlock it, we don’t need it anymore.

576
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,490
你在说什么?

我们只能自己做了。

如果没有，就把预付款掏出来。

Anyway, I’m out of this gig, so you’re on your own.

克隆全的手机是最好的。

当我打扮的漂漂亮亮，

780
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,150
他会被撕碎的。

00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,790
-我们会再见的。――谢谢。
- I’ll see you again. - Thank you.

863
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,170
尤里。
Yuri.

864
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,550
Da-rong Xiao-rong。
Da-rong, Xiao-rong.

865
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,140
我看起来是不是很蠢?
Don’t I look so dope?

866
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,900
你是来吃饭的吗?
Did you come here to dine?

867
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,590
这是怎么呢
What’s going on?

868
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,510
这里面一定有误会。
There must be a misunderstanding.

869
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,220
误解?
Misunderstanding?

870
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,270
你死在这里是个误会。
You dying here is a misunderstanding.

871
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,520
砍下来。
Chop them down.

872
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,580
放松，让我们都冷静下来!
Easy, let’s all calm down!

873
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:22,040
这是一个误解。
It’s a misunderstanding.

874
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,500
没有必要战斗。
There’s no need to fight.

875
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,750
仔细思考一下这个问题。
Think this through.

876
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,380
暴怒犯罪现在很猖獗。
Rage crimes are rampant now.

877
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,510
那些不是帮派成员的人会很乐意买枪。
Those not in gangs will readily buy guns.

878
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,970
我们为什么要故意挑起战争?
Why’d we intentionally start a war?

879
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,890
我们只会成为调查的目标。
We’ll only become a target of investigation.

880
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,740
那是谁杀了我们的老师?
So who killed our don?

881
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,990
罗马学者西塞罗曾经说过，
Roman scholar Cicero said once,

882
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,370
“对谁有好处?”
“To whom is it a benefit?”

883
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,630
如果罗德奥和阿克斯家族开战，谁会受益?
If Rodeo and Axe clans go to war, who will benefit from it?

884
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,500
Gangbook混蛋吗?
Gangbook bastards?

885
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,920
好。
Good.

886
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,510
你知道答案。
You know the answer.

887
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,010
的王八蛋!
Sons of bitches!

888
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,840
这些枪多少钱?
How much are the guns?

889
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,100
这要看你订多少了。
Depends on how many you order.

890
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,560
- 100单位。- - - - - -很好。
- 100 units. - Very well.

891
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:25,390
作为对阁下的哀悼，我只接受80%的价签。
As a condolence to your don, I’ll only accept 80% of price tag.

892
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,850
在哪里?
Where is it?

893
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,980
枪不在这里，我今晚就转移。
Guns aren’t here, I’ll transfer them tonight.

894
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,780
我稍后会通知你时间和地址。
I’ll notify you the time and address later.

895
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,250
吸血的混蛋……
Blood-sucking bastards...

896
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
肮脏的混蛋……
Dirty bastards...

897
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,670
交接就在今晚。
The handoff is tonight.

898
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:01,180
你在听吗?
Are you listening?

899
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:02,930
这是牛肉!
It’s beef!

900
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,730
来吧……
Come on...

901
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:14,480
怎么了?
What’s wrong?

902
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,700
昨天打断鼻子的那个人来了。
The guy who broke his nose yesterday is here.

903
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:17,860
哪一个?
Which one?

904
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,450
他穿着桌布。
He’s wearing the table cloth.

905
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,290
哦,波多黎各。
Oh, Puerto Rico.

906
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:27,000
我们暴露了，我们得出去。
We’re exposed, we have to get out.

907
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,840
我们要离开。
We gotta leave.

908
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,750
我还没吃甜点呢。
I didn’t have my dessert yet.

909
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,800
我们暴露了!
We’re exposed!

910
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,420
暴露?
Exposed?

911
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,180
――快点!-我听到了!
- Hurry up! - I hear you!

912
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,980
――悄悄地来。――好吧!
- Come quietly. - Okay!

913
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:57,990
――嘿!-那个婊子…
- Hey! - That bitch...

914
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,070
该死的!
Goddamn!

915
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,500
你带他。
You take him.

916
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:22,260
用这个!
Take this!

917
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,390
你这个混蛋!把它放下!
You bastard! Put that down!

918
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,810
何…冷……
It’s ho... cold...

919
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,260
呆在我后面。
Stay behind me.

920
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,800
我会照顾他们的。
I’ll take care of them.

921
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,390
至少要坚持走下去。
At least walk the walk.

922
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,110
- Dope Woo私家侦探社?――是吗?
- Dope Woo P.I. Agency? - Yes?

923
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,570
你为什么在这里?
Why are you here?

924
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,820
如果我告诉你真相，你会放我走吗?
If I tell you the truth, will you let me go?

925
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,360
当然可以。
Of course.

926
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:12,200
你认识保安主管金荣古吗?
You know head of security Kim Yeong Gu?

927
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,160
是的。
Yes.

928
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,130
她雇我去找他。
She hired me to find him.

929
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:19,630
为什么?
Why?

930
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,380
她是个拜金女。
She’s a gold digger.

931
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,800
她本来要骗他的，结果却被骗了。
She was going to scam him, but got scammed instead.

932
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:32,020
双重骗局，你能相信吗?
A double scam, can you believe it?

933
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,850
她的智商一定很低。
Her IQ must be pretty low.

934
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,940
你是来见金先生的吗?
So you came here to meet Mr. Kim?

935
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,060
是的,这是正确的。
Yes, that’s right.

936
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,110
那你昨天为什么去阿克斯家族总部?
Then why were you at the Axe clan HQ yesterday?

937
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,150
我昨天在哪?
I was where yesterday?

938
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:51,660
阿克斯家族的唐被枪杀时你也在现场。
You were at the scene when the Axe clan don was shot.

939
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:57,330
那家夜店就是阿克斯家族的总部吗?
That night club was the Axe clan HQ?

940
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,380
发生了什么事,
What happened was,

941
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:03,340
我们是在看到金的通话记录后才去的。
we went there after seeing Kim’s call log.

942
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:04,840
你看到他的通话记录了吗?
You saw his call log?

943
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:05,800
是的。
Yes.

944
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,090
所以你黑了他的电话?
So you hacked his phone?

945
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,970
当然，那根本不是工作。
Sure, that wasn’t even work.

946
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,810
然后你在手机里看到了其他东西?
Then you saw other stuff in the phone?

947
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,520
不，一点也不。
No, not at all.

948
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,520
你怎么能看不见呢?
How could you not see it?

949
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:23,230
她什么都看到了，什么都知道!
She saw everything, she knows it all!

950
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,110
什么叫我们一起看的。
What do you mean, we saw it together.

951
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,110
不!我的眼睛不好，我需要眼镜才能看东西!
No! My eyes are bad, I need glasses to see!

952
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,410
我的视力被扭曲了。
I got distorted vision.

953
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,780
你诡计多端的混蛋!你付了这么多钱!
You scheming bastard! You paid you so much!

954
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,410
她的脾气很坏，像个拜金女。
Like a real gold digger, she’s got a foul temper.

955
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,540
我做这个是为了赚钱，但压力太大了。
I’m doing this to make money, but it’s nonstop stress.

956
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,130
真的很难!
It’s really hard!

957
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,340
所以,卡洛斯……
So, Carlos...

958
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:48,340
我是说，吴先生，你根本不认识金先生吗?
I mean, Mr. Woo, you don’t know Mr. Kim at all?

959
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,010
这是正确的。
That’s correct.

960
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:55,060
你可以问拜金女更多的细节。
You can ask the gold digger for more detail.

961
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,810
我现在可以走了吗?
May I leave now?

962
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,480
太好了。
Great.

963
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,020
谢谢你！
Thank you.

964
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,780
你能帮我个忙吗?
Could you do me a favor though?

965
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,330
如果你这么做了，我就放你们俩走。
If you do, I’ll let you both go.

966
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,800
看到那个派出所了吗?
See that police substation?

967
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,720
去杀了那里所有的警察。
Go and kill all police officers there.

968
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,980
杀警察?
Kill police officers?

969
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,940
别太难过。
Don’t feel too bad.

970
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,900
他们会因公殉职，
They’ll die in the line of duty,

971
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,570
他们的家人将得到特殊的养老金。
and their families will receive special pension.

972
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,820
不是简单的武器走私吗?
It wasn’t a simple arms smuggling?

973
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,490
不关你的事。
None of your business.

974
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:59,620
如果你逃跑，我们会杀了你。
If you run off, we will kill you.

975
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,300
如果你想活命，就照我说的做。
If you want to live, do as I say.

976
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,230
别害怕，你有足够的弹药。
Don’t be scared, you got enough ammo.

977
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:32,910
好。
Good.

978
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:45,290
开枪，嫌犯在逃，车牌号43J-6449!
Shots fired, suspect on the run, plate number 43J-6449!

979
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,670
黑色K5，重复，43J-6449!
Black K5, I repeat, 43J-6449!

980
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,070
我能为您效劳吗?
Can I help you?

981
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,160
举起手来!
Hands up!

982
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,130
放下枪!
Drop the gun!

983
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,190
基督…
Christ...

984
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:52,650
所以你当时在调查一起军火走私，
So you were investigating an arms trafficking,

985
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,650
他们抓了你的情报部门搭档
and they captured your NIS agent partner?

986
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,530
是的。
Yes.

987
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,570
这是巨大的。
That’s huge.

988
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,700
给她打电话，开免提。
Give her a call, put it on speaker.

989
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,670
她肯定不能回答，她被囚禁了。
She certainly can’t answer, she’s in captivity.

990
01:08:09,330 --> 01:08:12,420
所以你就试试吧，迁就我。
That’s why give it a try, just humor me.

991
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,920
你真的不明白，她被抓了。
You really don’t get it, she’s captured.

992
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:18,430
只是看。
Just watch.

993
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,720
Yoo Da-hee
Yoo Da-hee

994
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,060
嗯?
Huh?

995
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,020
喂?
Hello?

996
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,560
你在哪里?你没事吧?
Where are you? You okay?

997
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,110
我当然没事。
Of course I’m okay.

998
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,270
有什么事吗?
What’s up?

999
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,280
你了!
You’re captured!

1000
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,650
你什么意思?我正在回家的路上。
What do you mean? I’m on my way home.

1001
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,660
什么?
What?

1002
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,990
别再给我打电话了。
And don’t call me anymore.

1003
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,330
我们已经喝了多少杨平汤了?

她是中国国安局的特工。

01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:36,980
为什么一个中国特工来这里阻止武器走私?

虽然你曾协助过外国情报人员，

你没有对我们的国家利益造成任何伤害。

1049
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,100
Yoo Da-hee ?

她是作为祭品被送到这里的。

1052
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,700
你会让她死吗?

1053
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:34,540
我们为什么要照顾外国代理人?
Why should we take care of a foreign agent?

1054
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,330
这就像泰国行动一样。

1058
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:46,300
如果她是吗?

我们只代表国家利益行事。

当心

01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,190
TT-33型号不安全，请小心。
TT-33 models don’t have safety, so please be careful.

1143
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,780
什么是万事通。
What a know-it-all.

1144
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,450
我在华盛顿上大学时，
When I attended college in Washington,

1145
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,580
我在一家武器协会实习。

我得到它!

1147
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,830
我明白了……
I got it...

1148
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,170
我有东西可以测试这些枪。

1149
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,760
她很可爱，要么杀了她，要么带走她。
She’s a cutie, so kill her or take her.

1150
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:04,510
有趣的,很好。
Interesting, good.

1151
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:09,140
综合控制中心有任何更新吗?
Any updates from Integrated Control Center?

1152
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:12,440
不，交通太拥挤，要花些时间。
No, there’s too much traffic, so it’ll take a while.

1153
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,810
男人。
Man...

1154
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,110
――举起手来!――是的,先生。
- Hands up! - Yes, sir.

1155
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,700
60次还款中我付了1次。
I made 1 out of 60 payments...

1156
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,240
的王八蛋……
Sons of bitches...

1157
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,990
我还没有把所有的塑料都剥皮……
I haven’t peeled all plastic...

1158
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,790
看起来很重要的…
That looks important...

1159
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,000
从DSC。
It’s from DSC.

1160
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,090
我发出了那个请求。
I sent that request.

1161
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,420
去看看吧。
Go take a look.

1162
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,260
你有什么要求?
What did you request?

1163
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,970
那个王八蛋，吴素汉。
That bastard, Woo Su-han.

1164
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,970
我要了他的服役记录。
I requested his service records.

1165
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:49,810
然后呢?
And?

1166
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,690
他曾是707特种部队的。
He’s ex-Special Forces 707.

1167
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:54,850
白痴吗?
That idiot?

1168
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,900
他被开除军籍。
He was dishonorably discharged.

1169
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:00,860
原因是什么?
What was the reason?

1170
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,280
违抗命令，长官。
Disobeying an order, sir.

1171
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,030
混蛋，他看起来确实不听话。
Bastard, he did look disobedient.

1172
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,620
但707不是超级难考吗?
But isn’t 707 super hard to get into?

1173
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,830
对，真的很难。
Right, it’s really hard.

1174
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,420
他没参与那次混乱或基地交易吗?
He didn’t work the mess or the base exchange?

1175
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:14,670
没有,先生。
No, sir.

1176
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,880
他是一名近距离作战教官。
He was a close combat instructor.

1177
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,260
笨蛋吗?
That dumbass?

1178
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,810
小荣，你要去哪里?
Xiao-rong, where you going?

1179
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,560
我好像听到了什么。
I thought I heard something.

1180
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,820
首席!
Chief!

1181
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,200
没事的，这里没人。
It’s okay, no one’s here.

1182
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,290
运动鞋。
Sneakers over there.

1183
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,710
你怎么这么久才来?
What took you so long?

1184
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,470
我以最快的速度赶来了。
I got here as soon as possible.

1185
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,840
警察吗?
Cops?

1186
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,640
别担心，我弄丢了，我做得很好，对吧?
Don’t worry, I lost them, I did good, right?

1187
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,510
你为什么不带他们来?
Why didn’t you bring them?!

1188
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,020
我怎么能呢?他们在追我!
How could I? They’re after my ass!

1189
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:21,020
你不是NIS探员，对吧?
You’re not an NIS agent, right?

1190
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,990
我吗?为什么我是NIS?
Me? Why am I NIS?

1191
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,700
我知道它。
I knew it.

1192
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,990
我以为你是情报院的探员。
I thought you were an NIS agent.

1193
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,240
那你来这里干什么?所有的吗?
Then why are you here? All by yourself?

1194
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:36,830
Yoo Da-hee。
Yoo Da-hee.

1195
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,130
我还欠我一万美元。
I’m still owed $10,000.

1196
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,050
只有在工作之后!
Only after the job!

1197
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,170
这就是我来的原因。
That’s why I came.

1198
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,180
我来处理这件事，快报警。
I’ll take care of this, so call it in.

1199
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,470
我救了你，你还唠叨吗?
You nag even after I rescue you?

1200
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:56,730
这里没有信号。
There’s no signal here.

1201
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,230
发个短信，效果会更好。
Send a text, it’ll work better.

1202
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,360
你是故意的吗?
Are you doing it on purpose?

1203
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,740
什么?
What?

1204
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:10,410
我不知道过去发生了什么，
I don’t know what happened in the past,

1205
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:15,330
但为了避免受伤，你表现得很肤浅。
but you’re acting shallow to avoid getting hurt.

1206
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,050
你看穿了我，我也这么认为。
You saw right through me, I think so too.

1207
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,920
我什么都不该说的。
I shouldn’t have said anything.

1208
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:46,320
Da-hee,有什么?
Da-hee, got anything?

1209
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,360
什么?像什么?
What? Like what?

1210
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,620
什么我…
What do I...

1211
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:00,580
上士，你在干什么?!
Chief, what are you doing?!

1212
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:02,130
我的眼睛!
My eyes!

1213
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,050
我们走吧!
Let’s go!

1214
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,350
真的刺……
It really stings...

1215
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:30,610
这条路对吗?
Is this the right way?

1216
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:32,360
我怎么知道?这是我第一次来这里。
How should I know? It’s my first time here.

1217
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,870
――Da-hee。――是吗?
- Da-hee. - Yes?

1218
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,830
待回来。
Stay back.

1219
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,390
我们走吧。
Let’s go.

1220
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:00,740
Xiao-rong !
Xiao-rong!

1221
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:03,540
这是怎么呢
What’s going on?

1222
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,790
我想我们有不速之客。
I think we have uninvited guests.

1223
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:11,590
为了测试这些枪，介意我们去打猎吗?
To test these guns out, mind if we go on a hunt?

1224
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,760
当然,享受。
Certainly, enjoy.

1225
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:27,520
Da-rong,他死了。
Da-rong, he’s dead.

1226
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:34,440
Da-rong……
Da-rong...

1227
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,240
我要亲手杀了他!
I’m gonna kill him myself!

1228
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:50,840
他们在找人。
They’re looking for someone.

1229
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,670
他们在找我们。
They’re looking for us.

1230
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,140
什么!
What the!

1231
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:36,970
嘿!
Hey!

1232
01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:40,220
发生了什么事?
What happened?

1233
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,050
这甚至不是工作。
That was not even work.

1234
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:48,190
大熙，警察给我发了条短信。
Da-hee, got a text from cops.

1235
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:50,100
警察吗?他们已经在路上了?
Cops? They’re on the way?

1236
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,520
他们找到了那个婊子。
They found the bitch.

1237
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,480
哪个婊子?
Which bitch?

1238
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:56,490
那个女人的，失踪的狗。
That woman’s, the missing dog.

1239
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,950
寻回犬吗?多萝西?
That retriever? Dorothy?

1240
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,950
我很高兴他们找到了她。
I’m so glad they found her.

1241
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:03,780
管他呢，我们有危险!
Who cares, we’re in danger!

1242
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,580
别担心。
Don’t worry.

1243
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,450
把你的枪。
Toss your gun.

1244
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:14,040
如果你这么做，我们都死定了。
If you do, we’re both dead.

1245
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:20,210
那我们就从一颗子弹开始吧。
Then let’s begin with a bullet in her.

1246
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,140
枪膛里有一个，混蛋!
One in the chamber, asshole!

1247
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,720
把你的枪!
Toss your gun!

1248
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:41,460
我是尤里。
I’m Yuri.

1249
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:43,120
Yeri吗?
Yeri?

1250
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,010
我,Seulgi。
Me, Seulgi.

1251
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:55,260
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

1252
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,260
他一定也是红丝绒乐队的粉丝。
He must be a Red Velvet fan too.

1253
01:31:58,350 --> 01:31:58,890
什么? !
What?!

1254
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:02,890
让我们决斗到底。
Let’s duel it out.

1255
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:03,940
Seulgi。
Seulgi.

1256
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,360
Seulgi呢?
What about Seulgi?

1257
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,280
我把我的借给你。
I’ll lend you mine.

1258
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:18,330
天啊，他差点就抓到我了。
Holy crap, he almost got me.

1259
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,700
不，我觉得他扔给你一个是为了和你决斗。
No, I think he tossed you one to have a duel with you.

1260
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,550
真是个怪胎，为什么会有人决斗?
What a weirdo, why’d anyone do a duel?

1261
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:54,280
嘿!仔细思考一下这个问题。
Hey! Think this through.

1262
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:56,820
有你这样的人才，我们可以发动一场革命。

1263
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,200
我付你多少钱都行。
And I’ll pay you whatever.

1264
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,620
革命?什么革命?
Revolution? What revolution?

1265
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:03,950
他想让朝鲜充斥枪支。
He wants to flood Korea with guns.

1266
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,420
为了什么?
For what?

1267
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,080
我们可以清理污染这个国家的垃圾。
We can clean up trash who’re polluting this country.

1268
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:10,790
这就是我正在做的。
That’s what I’m doing.

1269
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,090
不,不是我们!
No, not us!

1270
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,590
我们是革命者，真正的垃圾!
We are revolutionists, the real trash!

1271
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,220
不熟练,休眠的罪犯!
Unskilled, dormant criminals!

1272
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,970
我们可以清理那些垃圾!

1273
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:25,060
详细说明。
Elaborate.

1274
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:28,440
那些为了选举权而污染韩国的人!

1275
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,560
我们必须铲除那些垃圾!

1276
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:31,520
嘿!
Hey!

1277
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,450
你真喜欢聊天。
You sure like to talk.

1278
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,240
不，不是那个…
No, it’s not that...

1279
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,200
我不知道我为什么在这里…
I don’t know why I’m here...

1280
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,120
把他扔进马桶。
Dump him in the toilet.

1281
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:47,960
我真的很抱歉。
I’m really sorry.

1282
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,130
我就不能被打一顿吗?
Couldn’t I just get a beating here?

1283
01:33:51,210 --> 01:33:53,840
我很乐意挨打!
I’ll gladly get a beating!

1284
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,340
请不!
Please no!

1285
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,880
虽然不是故意的，
Although it wasn’t intentional,

1286
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:02,430
我的老板很高兴能结案
my bosses are happy about wrapping up this case

1287
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,220
与中国联合行动
as a joint op with China.

1288
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:05,810
那就把我弄出去
Then get me out of here.

1289
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,890
你给我们惹了太多麻烦了。
You stir up way too much trouble for us to do that.

1290
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,560
不过有一种方法。
There is one way though.

1291
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:12,360
什么?
What?

1292
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,780
成为我们的秘密特工。
Become our covert agent.

1293
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:18,280
你想让我成为NIS探员?
You want me to become an NIS agent?

1294
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,450
我们又收到了与中国联合行动的请求。
We received another request for a joint op with China.

1295
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:25,660
我们相信你是最适合的人选。
We believe you are perfect for it.

1296
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,700
你疯了吗?再做一遍吗?
Are you nuts? Do that again?

1297
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:29,790
不可能，我不会做的。
No way, I’m not doing it.

1298
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,880
你会被困在这里一段时间…
You’ll be stuck here for a while...

1299
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:38,130
等等，我阻止了枪支泛滥我们的国家…
Wait, I stopped guns from flooding our country...

1300
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:41,890
-这应该是情有可原…-殴打，人身伤害，谋杀
- It should be an extenuating... - Assault, bodily harm, murder,

1301
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:45,680
假扮警官，非法闯入，妨碍司法公正，破坏…
impersonating an officer, break-in, obstruction of justice, damage to...

1302
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,430
这么多……
So damn much...

1303
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:50,890
即使有可减轻罪责的情况，你至少也会被判十年。
Even with an extenuating circumstance, you’ll get 10 years minimum.

1304
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,730
我宁愿在这里待十年。
I’d rather stay here for 10 years.

1305
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,480
我好多次差点就死了!
I almost died so many times!

1306
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,190
我不干了。
I’m not doing it.

1307
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,070
永远,永远。
Never, ever.

1308
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:07,240
100000美元的护圈。
$100,000 retainer.

1309
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:10,460
行动结束后再给十万。
Another $100,000 upon completion of the op.

1310
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,210
交易!
Deal!

1311
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:18,840
儿科癌症病房
Pediatric Cancer Ward

1312
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:20,670
女士吗?
Ma’am?

1313
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,090
是吗?
Yes?

1314
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:25,970
很抱歉打扰你。
Sorry to bother you.

1315
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,640
我需要你的签名。
I need to get your signature.

1316
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,310
为了什么?
For what?

1317
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,150
在我们确定手术日期之前，需要监护人签字。
Before we fix the surgery date, the guardian needs to sign off.

1318
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,810
手术日期吗?
Surgery date?

1319
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,480
你决定拥有它。
You decided to have it.

1320
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:40,900
手术已经付过钱了。
Surgery was already paid for.

1321
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:48,700
我很感激你解决了这件事。
I’m so thankful that you resolved the incident.

1322
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,290
不，是我们欠你的。
No, we’re the one in your debt.

1323
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:55,790
是吗?
Eh?

1324
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:00,380
已经有一段时间了。
It’s been a while.

1325
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:01,920
你们可能已经知道了
As you may already know,

1326
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:04,470
他是这次联合行动的搭档探员。
he’s your partner agent for this joint op.

1327
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,430
很高兴见到你，我是赵探员。
Good to meet you, I’m Agent Chao.

1328
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,600
吸引Su-han。
Woo Su-han.

1329
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:09,970
“代理”?
“Agent”?

1330
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:12,480
事情就是这样发展的。
It worked out that way.

1331
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:16,770
阿玛特工怎么了?我联系不上他。
What happened to Agent Ama? I can’t reach him.

1332
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,980
我们正在积极地寻找他。
We are actively searching for him.

1333
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:24,450
会和多萝西失踪案有关吗?
Could it be related to the missing Dorothy case?

1334
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,620
我们必须从那个角度接近它。
We must approach it from that angle.

1335
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:28,530
多萝西?
Dorothy?

1336
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:32,450
多萝西到底是谁?
Who exactly is Dorothy?

1337
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:39,000
一个前克格勃线人的代号。
A codename for a former KGB informant.

1338
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,380
她要把一份朝鲜情报交给阿玛特工，
She was to hand over a North Korea intel to Agent Ama,

1339
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:46,760
但两者都是遥不可及的。
but both are unreachable.

1340
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:50,850
她要怎么交出去?
How was she supposed to hand it over?

1341
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,270
多萝西喜欢黄金,
Dorothy loves gold,

1342
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:57,560
所以她通常会把微型SD卡嵌入金条里。
so she normally imbeds micro SD card inside a gold bar.

1343
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,690
金猪在哪里?
Where’s the gold pig?

1344
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:05,530
-我卖了。――什么?
- I sold it. - What?

1345
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:06,320
能再重复一遍吗?
Pardon?

1346
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:07,820
――这是什么。――没有,先生。
- It’s nothing. - Nothing, sir.

1347
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:11,120
你们要伪装成一对潜入
You are to disguise as a couple and infiltrate

1348
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,160
我们认为他们被囚禁的地方。
the place where we think they’re in captivity.

1349
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:15,160
――几?――几?
- A couple? - A couple?

1350
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:16,920
你们俩是同步的。
You two are in sync.

1351
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:17,620
-当然不是!-当然不是!
- Of course not! - Of course not!

1352
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:18,830
你今天没整理衣服吗?
Didn’t you coordinate your clothes today?

1353
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:19,790
――没门!――没门!
- No way! - No way!

1354
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,250
完全同步。
Totally in sync.

1355
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,590
我们非得穿成这样吗?
Do we have to dress like this?

1356
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:32,760
符拉迪沃斯托克!俄罗斯太冷了!
It’s Vladivostok! Russia is so cold!

1357
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:36,350
看看周围，没人穿得跟我们一样。
Look around, no one’s dressed like us.

1358
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:40,360
他们只是不知道!
They just don’t know!

1359
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,650
他们可能在路上下车。
They might get off on route.

1360
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:45,860
噢,是的。
Oh yeah.

1361
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:49,700
警察给你发的关于找到狗的短信是什么?
What was that text you got from cops about finding the dog?

1362
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:52,870
这不是多萝西。
It wasn’t Dorothy.

1363
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,370
你怎么能把金猪卖了?
How could you sell the gold pig?

1364
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:57,330
如果你没卖掉它，我们现在就结束了。
If you hadn’t sold it, we’d be done by now.

1365
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:59,710
你知道吗?它有一张SD卡?
Did you know? That it had an SD card?

1366
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:00,580
我是唯一一个吗?
Was I the only one?

1367
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:02,880
那为什么不把它拿回来?!
Then why not get it back?!

1368
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,220
他们把它熔化了……
They melted it down...

1369
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:09,640
你什么都做不好……
You can’t do anything right...

1370
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,430
告密者什么时候来?
When’s the informant coming?

1371
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:14,680
会合点在游轮的船头。
The meeting point is the cruise’s bow.

1372
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:20,980
喂?你在哪里?
Hello? Where are you?

1373
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,190
在我身后吗?
Behind me?

1374
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:26,990
有一个海洋。
There’s an ocean.

1375
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,280
什么?
What?

1376
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:35,240
你为什么穿成这样?
Why are you dressed like that?

1377
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:38,460
我们要坐这艘船?
We’re taking this boat?

1378
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:40,120
我们得悄悄地进去。
We have to go in stealthily.

1379
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,420
我知道它。
I knew it.

1380
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:49,930
我们真的能坐这艘船到那里吗?
Can we really get there on this boat?

1381
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,390
我们很快就会知道了。
We’ll find out soon.

1382
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,470
什么?什么地狱? !
What? What the hell?!

1383
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:53,890
什么?什么地狱? !金正日YOUNG-GWANG
What? What the hell?! KIM YOUNG-GWANG

1384
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:58,310
金正日YOUNG-GWANG
KIM YOUNG-GWANG

1385

李孙膑

1386
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:10,030
金炯洲(Kim hyung-joo)编剧和导演
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY KIM HYUNG-JOO

1387
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:17,370
你什么都不记得了?
So you don’t remember anything?

1388
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:21,870
不。
No.

1389
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:26,130
有弹出的图像吗?没有什么呢?
Any images that pop up? Nothing like that?

1390
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:36,810
我看到一个男人，裸体，被绑在椅子上。
I see a man, naked and tied to a chair.

1391
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:39,220
他沉迷于BDSM…
He was into BDSM...

1392
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:42,520
还有一把枪，一把刀和一根针，
And a gun, knife and a needle,

1393
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,310
我一直看到这些。
I keep seeing those.

1394
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,980
他经常有自杀的念头。
He had constant suicidal thoughts.

1395
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:52,360
如果它是好的,
If it’s okay,

1396
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:56,780
我知道有人可能能帮你。
I know someone who may be able to help you.

1397
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,620
你想见见他吗?
Would you like to meet him?

1398
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,830
我肯定你过得很艰难。
I’m sure it’s been tough.

1399
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:07,210
感觉好多了。
Perception’s gotten so much better.

1400
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:09,630
所以不要做任何令人遗憾的事。
So don’t do anything regrettable.

1401
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:13,630
你是在这里。我们找到你的家人了。
Here you were. We found your family member.

1402
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,300
是吗?
Yeah?

1403
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:19,180
亲爱的!亲爱的!亲爱的!
Honey! Honey! Honey!

1404
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:22,390
我到处找你!
I looked everywhere for you!

1405
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,900
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

1406
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,310
“亲爱的”?
“Honey”?

1407
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:29,070
因为我是他妻子。
Because I’m his wife.

1408
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,740
不是他的姑姑吗?
Not his aunt?

1409
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:35,360
你说这些话是在冒生命危险!
You’re risking your life with those words!

1410
01:40:36,410 --> 01:40:38,870
很明显这很奇怪。
It’s obvious this is very peculiar.

1411
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,290
为什么这个帅哥要嫁给你这样的人?
Why’d this handsome man marry someone like you?

1412
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,120
你对女人的吸引力了解多少?
What’d you even know about women’s attraction?

1413
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,380
我真的不明白。
I really don’t get it.

1414
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,130
亲爱的，我们去别的地方吧。
Honey, let’s go somewhere else.

1415
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:54,550
你以前有女人的麻烦，现在也有男人的麻烦了?
You had women trouble in the past, but now men too?

1416
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:56,260
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1417
01:40:56,340 --> 01:40:59,850
当然是我们的家，不关你的事!
Our home, of course, none of your business!

1418
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:03,770
我们怎么能把一个可疑的女人托付给他?
How could we trust him with a suspicious woman?

1419
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,600
可疑吗?我们结婚了!
Suspicious? We’re married!

1420
