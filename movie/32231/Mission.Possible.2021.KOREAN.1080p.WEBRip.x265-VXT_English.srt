kth presents

2
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,944
a GNOSIS COMPANY production

3
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,196
Ministry of State Security, China

4
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,577
They’re sending 500 Tokarevs
to North Korea.

5
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,995
Tokarevs?

6
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,581
Confirm it.

7
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,506
I understand.

8
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,259
Lock it down at once.

9
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,218
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,139
Do you know who I am?!

11
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,141
Give me my phone!

12
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,019
One call from me, you’ll...

13
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,312
Shut up!

14
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,233
The party knows all about it.

15
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,111
Those guns were to be scrapped,

16
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,446
what’s the big deal?

17
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,075
North Korea has never
requested them.

18
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,661
That can’t be!

19
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,830
Where are the guns now?

20
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,999
It’s being transported
to South Korea.

21
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,836
I didn’t know!

22
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,879
I thought they were
bound for the North!

23
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,215
Anyway,

24
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,758
I’ll clean it up!

25
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,093
Release me!

26
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,640
What are you doing?

27
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,439
I’ll take my team and
clean it up in South Korea.

28
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,987
You’re certain you can be covert
carrying out this mission

29
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,574
with your entire team there?

30
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,576
What if you get caught?

31
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,786
How should we do this then?

32
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,668
Send this one over alone.

33
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,756
But she’s just a trainee,

34
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,134
she’ll be up against
an arms dealer.

35
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,512
I know!

36
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,848
That’s why I’m sending her.

37
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,142
Sending her to die?

38
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,310
Chief Chao.

39
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:56,398
‘The Chinese government
did all it can,

40
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,944
and lost a Beijing University grad
young agent in the process.

41
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,489
What did the South Korean
government do in the meantime?’

42
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,367
We can respond as such.

43
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,702
Dismissed!

44
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,996
Sir.

45
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,586
What if...

46
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,590
she accomplishes her mission?

47
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,929
If she is that talented,
we’ll groom her.

48
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,140
But don’t expect much.

49
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:37,189
Her mission is to go and die.

50
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:45,864
MISSION: POSSIBLE

51
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,435
Dope Woo P.I. Agency

52
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,442
What are you doing
with the lights off?

53
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,569
Huh?

54
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,115
I was going to get
some shut eye.

55
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,742
What brings you here?

56
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,079
Sit down.

57
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,708
Want something to drink?

58
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,418
I stopped by for a sec.

59
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,306
We switched hospital.

60
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,184
But I got a call
from the old one.

61
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,394
They said someone paid the bill.

62
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:03,192
You don’t need to
give this back.

63
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,444
I paid it because
I’m doing well.

64
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,447
I’m super busy lately.

65
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,326
Mr. Woo!

66
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,536
You were in?

67
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,873
The lights were out earlier.

68
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,208
Yes, sir.

69
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,461
Mr. Woo, it’s getting out of hand.

70
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,546
The rent wasn’t deposited yesterday.

71
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,841
Do I always have to
come here to get the rent?

72
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,135
That’s not possible.

73
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,346
Of course it’s possible!

74
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,266
I know you laid off your staff
and having a tough...

75
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,978
Oh! I deposited a check.

76
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,650
You know the bank takes
a few days to get that processed.

77
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:46,902
All right.

78
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:50,155
I can check it
with the bank tomorrow.

79
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,408
- Take care.
- Good bye.

80
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,372
So many people
pay me with checks.

81
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,998
Su-han.

82
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,045
Don't worry about us.

83
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,548
Do you understand?

84
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,652
Chinatown, Incheon,
South Korea

85
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,618
Captain.

86
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,588
- Speak Korean.
- Yes, sir.

87
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,092
Hello?

88
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,012
I haven’t forgotten,
I understand.

89
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,433
Was that the director?

90
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,102
It was my wife,
she ordered cosmetics.

91
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,771
I see...

92
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,703
National ID: Yoo Da-hee

93
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,038
Yoo Da-hee?

94
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,665
All intel concerning this op
is in the tablet,

95
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,835
if anything comes up,
call me, don’t message.

96
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,378
Understood.

97
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,088
You will not receive any support,

98
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,423
this is a solo op.

99
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:33,842
Understood.

100
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,762
This is a really dangerous op,
you could die!

101
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,515
I understand.

102
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,210
It’s been a while,
Agent Ama.

103
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,212
Good to see you,
Agent Chao.

104
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,880
How’s NIS these days?

105
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,759
Not good, we’re getting
weak by the day.

106
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,386
So what’s up?

107
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,764
I have an unofficial favor to ask.

108
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,355
That’s quite serious.

109
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,815
Will you help?

110
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,111
You may be asking too much.

111
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,530
I could get on
my agency’s bad side.

112
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,157
We’ll cover all expenses.

113
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,952
That's a given.

114
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,791
I’ll intro you to
a Russian informant.

115
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,173
Okay, very well.

116
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,760
Kiss time!

117
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,723
Tell your agent to
come to our temp office.

118
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,433
Can I trust you?

119
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,353
If you don’t,
who else can you trust?

120
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,274
We’ve saved each other’s lives.

121
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,111
Wait, what’s that?

122
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,532
It’s an earpiece.

123
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,576
Are you really that jumpy?

124
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,912
Occupational hazard.

125
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,496
Kiss time!

126
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,917
Family men’s secret rendezvous

127
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,668
Could this also be
called an affair?

128
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,004
They’re outed by the Kiss Cam!

129
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,756
We’re cheering for you!

130
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,517
$300.

131
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,852
They’re rare collectibles,
so no haggling.

132
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,065
I came to sublet this place
for a month like before.

133
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:54,816
What?

134
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,445
Oh, you’re him.

135
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,490
$5,000 like last time?

136
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:02,616
Yes.

137
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,619
By the way,

138
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,455
after you the last sublet,

139
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:13,418
I got weird calls and
weird people came by.

140
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,631
Are you with an intelligence agency?

141
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,591
$2,000 more.

142
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,888
I’ll get the cash,
so wipe this place down.

143
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,682
There were a lot of pest.

144
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,768
Sure, it’ll be spick and span!

145
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:41,780
Ma’am, are you okay?

146
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,430
Why isn’t he coming?

147
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,683
I should’ve cheaped out...

148
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,111
Do I need to sell these?

149
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,661
Go to this address, a covert agent
will help you unofficially.

150
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,831
Don’t forget, don’t ever say
you worked on this together.

151
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:34,708
Understood, sir.

152
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,677
Welcome.

153
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,680
Sit over here.

154
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,182
Okay...

155
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:57,898
I can...

156
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,786
What brings you here?

157
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,206
Your boyfriend cheating on you?
Or stalking you?

158
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,751
You didn’t get a call?

159
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,295
What call?

160
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,130
I thought it was all arranged.

161
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,716
Oh, from yesterday!

162
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,095
Don’t you know my captain well?

163
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,391
I guess you could say that,
but not really,

164
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,101
I don’t even know his name.

165
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,230
Right, that makes sense.

166
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,692
What did you hear yesterday?

167
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:46,405
To use this space,
and to get rid of some pest.

168
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,616
That won’t be necessary this time.

169
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,451
This isn’t an assassination mission.

170
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,622
I just need to gather some intel
and let the police take over.

171
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,874
Assassination?

172
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,085
- Here’s the advance.
- There’s misunderstanding...

173
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,089
Misunderstanding?

174
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,968
It’s nothing.

175
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:13,432
I’m not someone who doesn’t work
without a full pay upfront...

176
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,435
Oh...

177
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,104
Then can I pay
$10,000 in halves?

178
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:23,775
No, these are heavy,
I’ll take them.

179
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,610
They’re not heavy at all.

180
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,445
No, it’s okay!

181
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,704
Your name is Woo Su-han?

182
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,830
Yes.

183
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:41,293
I need to look like I work here,
so can I call you ‘boss’?

184
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,462
That’s a bit much...

185
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,298
‘Chief’ would be more appropriate.

186
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,759
Okay, chief.

187
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,761
What’s your name?

188
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,012
Yoo Da-hee, sir.

189
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,016
You can speak freely,
I’m your employee after all.

190
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,851
Okay, Da-hee.

191
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:02,481
I didn’t hear about
what my role is exactly.

192
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,649
I see.

193
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,485
Where’s the briefing room?

194
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,445
Briefing room...

195
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,279
There!

196
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,326
You want me to brief you on that?

197
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,118
Why not?

198
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,329
Security isn’t guaranteed here.

199
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,331
It’s all good,
barely anyone comes by.

200
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,805
Can I throw these out?

201
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,056
What?

202
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,225
No!

203
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:39,893
Holy cow...

204
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,316
I waited a long time
to get this autograph.

205
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,610
Got a new one?

206
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,112
Give it, hold on.

207
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,118
You’re into that?

208
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,497
No, it’s a piece of evidence
I collected.

209
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,291
Don’t worry about it.

210
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,632
SI Chem Park Du-sik

211
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,467
This man is our target.

212
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:16,013
SI Chem imports rare-earth
elements from China.

213
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:20,976
Mr. Woo.

214
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,561
You didn’t deposit any checks!

215
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,770
Rent for 3 months.

216
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,064
3 months?

217
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,193
Okay, thank you.

218
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,235
Sorry about that.

219
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,487
- Take care, sir.
- Yeah, sure.

220
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,032
Continue.

221
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,579
This place is not secured.

222
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,457
He’s just a landlord,
this doesn’t make sense to him.

223
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,047
Who did I say this guy was?

224
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,635
What was it, he imports
rare items.

225
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,594
Rare items?

226
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,972
Shrimps, lobsters,
stuff like that.

227
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,641
It’s rare-earth elements.

228
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,601
You only got ‘rare’ right.

229
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,355
Anyway, a few days ago,
they smuggled...

230
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,654
Welcome, how can I help you?

231
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,031
My baby disappeared...

232
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,075
Is that right?
Please sit down.

233
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,831
What are you doing?

234
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,000
I will not steal instant coffee again

235
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:30,963
Uh, she has sticky fingers...

236
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,591
Ms. Kim, it’s wrong to steal.

237
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,636
Ms. Kim, bring us 2 cups of coffee.

238
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,389
Ice coffee for me.

239
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,349
Me too, with tons of sugar syrup.

240
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,227
Chief.

241
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,897
Where’s coffee?

242
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,107
Go buy some.

243
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,951
What is the name
of your child?

244
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:01,952
Dorothy.

245
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,453
Do-what?

246
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,622
It’s an English name,
Dorothy.

247
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,040
Korean-American?

248
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,208
No, no.

249
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:16,425
There are pet detectives
who specialize in these things...

250
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,553
I’ll give you this.

251
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,099
We are the s-pet-cialist.

252
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,105
Please find her.

253
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,648
Don’t worry about a thing.

254
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:41,700
We find dogs too?

255
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,577
We got retained,
we have to.

256
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,290
Can I continue?

257
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,124
Okay.

258
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,296
All right, so SI Chem...
how many damn times!

259
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:04,473
Park smuggled 5,000 Tokarevs here
from China a few days ago.

260
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:08,101
Tokarev? TT-33?

261
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,811
A pistol?

262
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:10,562
Yes.

263
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,189
Investigating arms smuggling
by ourselves?

264
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,315
What about it?

265
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,360
A case of this scale
should be done by cops!

266
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,613
But cops only get involved
when there is evidence.

267
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,323
So she’s not a cop...

268
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,825
There is no evidence,
so we’re getting involved!

269
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,786
NIS? DSC?

270
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,247
No wonder they pay so much...

271
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,500
What’s with him?
Will he backstab me?

272
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,545
If things go sour,
I’ll bail.

273
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,298
Is there a problem?

274
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,050
Nope.

275
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:45,973
Park attends a tango café
in Gangnam every night.

276
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,976
I’ll dance with him
and extract his phone.

277
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,520
I’ll hand it over to you,
and you clone it.

278
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,604
Okay.

279
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:55,065
Do you know how to
clone a phone?

280
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,484
Of course, it’s just illegal.

281
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,737
What we do is illegal.

282
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,739
That sounds right.

283
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,783
But do you know how to tango?

284
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:08,453
Yes, I learned the basics.

285
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,455
Then I’ll see you...

286
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,336
at the tango café tomorrow.

287
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,256
Don’t forget the dress.

288
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:20,799
Dress?

289
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:22,968
That’s a given.

290
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,887
Do I need to wear it
to a practice?

291
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,556
Do you not wear a swimsuit
when swimming?

292
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,766
Oh...

293
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,479
Breathe out.

294
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:39,359
One, two, three...

295
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:46,742
Can I help you?

296
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,036
I want to learn tango...

297
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:49,995
Oh...

298
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:54,458
We do yoga first
then tango lesson after.

299
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:59,171
And you can wear something comfy.

300
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,673
Dress is only for competitions.

301
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,178
I knew it...

302
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:09,181
Do you have anything
to change into?

303
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,143
- Da-hee?
- Yes?

304
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:17,022
- Don’t fart on me.
- Shut the hell up!

305
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,622
- Hola!
- Hola!

306
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:34,706
Am I late?

307
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,458
No, we just started.

308
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,051
We are incredible together.

309
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,929
- Sure.
- Good.

310
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,810
Wait...

311
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,071
Your dress is spectacular.

312
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:30,721
Emergency...

313
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,481
What the, a flip phone?

314
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,153
Come on...

315
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,032
Sent: Mr. Jeon, you’re not reachable.

316
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,242
If you don’t answer by today,
I’ll call the police.

317
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:04,922
My apologies.

318
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,702
Oh my!

319
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:37,955
Are you okay?

320
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,373
Are you okay, Mr. Park?

321
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,751
I’m fine...

322
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,422
Yeah, I’m at the café.

323
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,719
What? What do you mean?

324
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:57,975
What were you doing?!

325
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,659
Mr. Park!

326
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,829
Ms. Lee, please help!

327
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:27,004
911? Please send help,
a man collapsed.

328
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,134
He’s already dead,
we need to go.

329
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,136
Why should we?

330
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,138
Things will get messy
when the police arrive.

331
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,974
No, we’d be suspicious
if we leave now.

332
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,893
You sure this is okay?

333
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,229
We didn’t do anything,
don’t worry about it.

334
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,904
So... do you two
know each other?

335
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:52,946
- Yes.
- No.

336
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,284
So do you know
each other or not?

337
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,329
We didn’t know each other,

338
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:04,208
but got acquainted today,
so we do now.

339
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,919
Met today...

340
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,630
- Mr. Woo Su-han?
- Yes?

341
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,131
You run a private detective agency?

342
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,090
Yes.

343
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,218
Were you at the tango café
to investigate someone?

344
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,513
No, it’s my hobby,
to learn it.

345
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:19,139
Hobby...

346
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,308
And Ms. Yoo Da-hee.

347
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,267
Yes?

348
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:25,437
It was your first
tango session today?

349
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:26,522
Yes.

350
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,942
But you two are all dressed up...

351
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,486
Right? Awkward, no?

352
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,572
Why is she all dressed up
to her first session?

353
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:37,658
With gloves too!

354
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,703
At least take your
bow tie off!

355
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:48,252
But why are we
getting investigated?

356
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,338
Because people thought
you two were suspicious.

357
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,257
- Who?
- Everyone.

358
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,885
But that doesn’t mean
we’re charged with a crime.

359
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:01,682
Right, and his cause of death
was heart attack too.

360
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,601
- So can we leave?
- Yes.

361
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:05,894
Thank you!

362
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,238
Sir, aren’t they a bit suspicious?

363
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,699
You don’t have
the experience to feel that way,

364
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,909
if you become like me,
you’ll develop intuition.

365
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,328
Look into those two further.

366
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,621
Sir? Why?

367
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,249
They got something,
I’m getting tingly.

368
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,671
So our work’s done?

369
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:33,672
How so?

370
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,340
The target’s dead.

371
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:38,969
Park must’ve been used
and killed afterwards.

372
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,763
Come on, you heard him,
it was a heart attack.

373
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:46,685
High doses of potassium chloride
could induce it with no trace.

374
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,687
You didn’t know?

375
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,356
Of course I knew.

376
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,193
It means professionals
got involved.

377
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:58,155
So we should report this
and take a step back.

378
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,115
Step back from what?

379
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,242
If you don’t want the job,
return the advance.

380
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,871
I was just testing
your tenacity.

381
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,955
Like hell you did.

382
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,124
Keep those words to yourself,
I can hear them.

383
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,585
Oh yeah, did you clone the phone?

384
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,799
It... was a flip phone.

385
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,718
So? You couldn’t?

386
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,220
It had the wrong plug!

387
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,805
And you never said it was
going to be a flip phone!

388
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,307
Everyone uses smartphones now.

389
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,184
What about the call logs?

390
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,477
I saw.

391
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,189
He texted someone called
‘Mr. Jeon’ recently,

392
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,483
he was going to call the cops
if Jeon wasn’t reachable.

393
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,693
Did you memorize the number?

394
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,321
You didn’t?

395
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:43,367
They all use burner phones,
why bother memorizing it?

396
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,994
Arms dealer must use burners,
why’d he use his own?

397
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,539
So what the hell
did we do today?

398
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,461
By the way,
where should I drop you off?

399
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,630
In front of the station.

400
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,048
- Which station?
- Daerim.

401
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,341
That’s too far!

402
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,759
So why did you ask?

403
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,886
I thought you’d say
“Closest subway station”!

404
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,680
How could I hop on
a subway in this?

405
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,348
So why did you dress like that?

406
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:09,268
I dressed like this
because of someone!

407
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,398
It’s about the agent
I’m working with.

408
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,525
I don’t think he’s an agent.

409
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:20,487
That’s his talent,
no one knew he was an agent.

410
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,740
His codename is Ama Zing
for a reason.

411
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,326
I understand.

412
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:40,591
So he had no ID
or anything to identify him?

413
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,551
No, he had nothing,

414
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,595
and his phone had no records.

415
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:46,847
By the way,

416
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:49,516
I think I saw him recently.

417
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:50,809
Where?

418
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,686
On YouTube.

419
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,938
He was on a Kiss Cam
with a guy,

420
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,858
and outed as a gay
at the baseball game.

421
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,195
It went viral online.

422
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,201
So he attempted suicide
by running into traffic?

423
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,244
That sounds plausible.

424
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,830
That’s not right...

425
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,921
I’m going to save this man
no matter what.

426
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,340
Hang in there.

427
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,344
Why are you late?

428
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,138
Working, obviously.

429
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:31,934
Lost Puppy

430
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,269
We have to do this too?

431
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,647
We got paid, so yeah.

432
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:38,273
All right.

433
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,901
Why are you here?
I thought we were done.

434
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,822
You didn’t see the news?

435
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,202
Rodeo mob boss was
shot to death.

436
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:51,995
Last night.

437
00:31:58,585 --> 00:31:59,545
Get him!

438
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:02,923
Then what?

439
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,634
Guns are already on the streets?

440
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,011
That’s what we have to find out.

441
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:12,182
Do you know anyone
who’s connected to that world?

442
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,141
“That world”?

443
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,893
Yeah, mobs and gangs.

444
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,104
How do I know that,
cops should though.

445
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,234
If you don’t feel like working,
cough up the advance.

446
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:24,736
I know an expert in that world.

447
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,280
Then let’s go!

448
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,240
It costs money, that’s why.

449
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,075
How much?

450
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,160
$2,000.

451
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:39,543
Here.

452
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,088
You sure about this?

453
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,300
Totally sure,
he’s like a fortune teller.

454
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,263
It’s been so long.

455
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,931
Yup.

456
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,518
We actually came to
a real fortune teller?

457
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,981
He’s famous among gangsters,
he’s an insider.

458
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,775
What brings you here today?

459
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,445
Your sexual compatibility?

460
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:07,362
- No!
- No!

461
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,031
You sure?

462
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:12,326
You two will create a whirlwind.

463
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,577
Forget that.

464
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,872
Did you hear anything
about Rodeo mob lately?

465
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,624
Why do you ask?!

466
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,213
That’s only $1,950.

467
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,177
Here it is.

468
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:33,847
He’s so good,
he knew right away.

469
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:36,725
You troublemaker.

470
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:44,483
Rodeo mob boss dropped in
out of the blue to ask me,

471
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,693
whether he was destined
to die with a bullet.

472
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:48,487
What did you tell him?

473
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,406
I told him that’d never happen.

474
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,742
The chance of someone
getting shot in Korea

475
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,079
is about the same as
getting hit by a lightning.

476
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,123
That’s common sense.

477
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,670
Oh no, no, no!

478
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:06,338
Holy shit! I’m so fucked!

479
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,591
Did you hear anything else?

480
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,678
Whether Rodeo was
trying to acquire guns?

481
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,721
That’d never happen!

482
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,058
Rodeo has a firm grasp
of Gangnam district.

483
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,144
Why’d they intentionally
get on the cops’ crosshair?

484
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:26,316
They can leak intel on their rivals

485
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:28,527
and use the cops
to their advantage.

486
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:32,072
Screwing your rivals legally
is the best way!

487
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,866
He’s right!

488
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,993
There’s no need for turf wars.

489
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:39,496
There aren’t any
gang wars in Korea!

490
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,581
Except one.

491
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,417
The Axe clan.

492
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:44,918
Axe clan?

493
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,381
They’re a vicious clan,
unlike other gangs.

494
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,801
They got mixed up
with a Chinese gang,

495
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,345
and they completely took over.

496
00:34:56,638 --> 00:35:01,268
If it was them,
anything is possible, yup.

497
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,978
Bring it, bring it.

498
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,354
I’m so thirsty.

499
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,239
Why is this so sour?

500
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,201
This drink is expired!

501
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:22,039
Kiddo, the juice is expired,
throw them out, all right?

502
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,961
We better look into the Axe clan.

503
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,463
Axe clan?

504
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:34,343
The smugglers may start a gang war
in order to sell guns.

505
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:38,430
If Rodeo won’t budge,
they’ll agitate the Axe clan.

506
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,724
Are you nuts?!
You heard him!

507
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,601
He said they’re vicious!

508
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,770
You sure are a chicken
for a seasoned expert.

509
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,730
I don’t believe it.

510
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,649
It’s not that I’m a chicken,

511
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:52,277
I’m just not a fan of having
an amateur tagging along.

512
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,531
Don’t worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

513
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:58,242
Did you learn boxing diet
or something?

514
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,493
Boxing diet?

515
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:02,955
Should I show you?

516
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,832
Jeez, all right, show me.

517
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,335
If I hit you,
we’re going to the Axe clan.

518
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,087
Fine, go ahead.

519
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,131
The ring and the street
are completely dif...

520
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:23,684
You wanted me to hit you.

521
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,436
I let you hit me.

522
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:30,399
Any blood stains?

523
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,531
We’re from Major Crimes.

524
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,334
I already talked to cops earlier.

525
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,669
That it wasn’t us.

526
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,921
Did an arms dealer
come by recently?

527
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,381
Nope.

528
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:57,259
We’ve arrested that dealer.

529
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:03,265
Why don’t you
go ask him then?

530
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,977
If you’re uncooperative,
we will arrest you.

531
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:10,606
Do you have an arrest warrant?

532
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:13,358
Gang violence is a special law,
so it doesn’t need one.

533
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:14,443
Didn’t know.

534
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,946
I’ve had it, cuff him,
we’ll interrogate him at the station.

535
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,448
Cuff him?

536
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,992
- Yes, handcuffs.
- I don’t have one.

537
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:28,415
Where’s your head at!

538
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:29,750
How could you not bring a pair?!

539
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,638
What’s this?

540
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,099
Suspects complained that
handcuffs were hurting their wrists,

541
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,352
so we’re testing this new pair.

542
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,312
The world has improved, no?

543
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,105
Protecting civil rights
of criminals too.

544
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:57,861
Shouldn’t you read me
the Miranda warning first?

545
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,154
Miranda warning?

546
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,364
Isn’t that done in medical school?

547
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,658
That’s Hippocratic Oath.

548
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,828
Right, Miranda warning, I know.

549
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,748
You have the right
to appoint a prosecutor.

550
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:11,500
- Lawyer.
- I know.

551
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:13,877
What are you doing?

552
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:16,213
You two aren’t cops, right?

553
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,589
- No.
- Yes.

554
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,159
Hurry!

555
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,202
Let’s go!

556
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,789
- Chief?
- Yes?

557
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:01,175
- Da-hee...
- Yes?

558
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:02,509
You go ahead...

559
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:03,886
How could I leave you?

560
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:06,388
I’m okay, you go on...

561
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,269
What the heck?

562
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,398
Isn’t that your nosebleed smudge?

563
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,357
What?

564
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:20,736
Dammit!

565
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,738
Crap...

566
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,081
What took you so long!

567
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,166
Screw you!

568
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,044
Very good.

569
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,228
These guys really are insane.

570
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,230
How could they
wield guns in Korea?

571
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,731
I almost died back there...

572
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:58,815
Do you know any hackers?

573
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,817
Hackers? What for?

574
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,194
We have to unlock this.

575
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:05,322
No need to unlock it,
we don’t need it anymore.

576
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,490
What’re you talking about?

577
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:11,703
You may not have noticed,
but those guys are pros.

578
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,164
I noticed.

579
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:19,044
They used double tap
and Mozambique Drill

580
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:21,296
with silencers and
subsonic ammo.

581
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,174
They had to be
experienced mercs.

582
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,884
Then call in the reinforcement!

583
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,427
No! I have to do this alone!

584
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:28,136
Why?

585
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:31,306
We just have to do it ourselves.

586
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,685
If not, cough up the advance.

587
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,480
I’m sick of it,
I’ll cough it all up!

588
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:42,025
Minus the 50% retainer,
expenses and hazard pay,

589
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,110
I’ll return $2,000, happy?

590
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,320
So are you gonna
pay back or not?!

591
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,406
I did some work,
I need to get paid too.

592
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:49,867
Anyway, I’m out of this gig,
so you’re on your own.

593
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,247
I’ll pay $10,000 more
after the job.

594
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,625
So you need a hacker?

595
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,085
I knew it.

596
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,130
It costs money, that’s all.

597
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,423
How much?

598
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:05,591
About $3,000.

599
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:06,592
3...

600
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,099
And don’t skimp $50 like before.

601
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,018
That was so embarrassing.

602
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:20,606
That was an honest mistake.

603
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:27,404
Are you in business?

604
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:32,409
Hold on, hold on,
I can’t save here.

605
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,498
I saw ‘You Died’
so many times today.

606
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:40,292
Yoo Da-hee?
You two know each other?

607
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,210
Say what?

608
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,258
When did you get that?

609
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:51,094
There was a showcase recently.

610
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,888
Hey, could I take one?

611
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,014
Hell no.

612
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,849
I gave you a concert ticket last time.

613
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,392
Oh yeah...

614
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:58,977
Okay, take one.

615
00:41:59,061 --> 00:41:59,895
Dope!

616
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:04,650
I’m gonna take this one too.

617
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,819
No, not ‘Seulgi’,
don’t be a bastard!

618
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,697
You’re into ‘Yeri’,
I’ll give you hers when I get it.

619
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,116
- You promise?
- Absolutely.

620
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,827
Are you serious?

621
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:17,329
Aren’t we here on business?

622
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,251
Could you unlock this?

623
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:26,630
Payment up front.

624
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:27,965
Of course.

625
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:30,384
Here.

626
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,303
No need to check
between us.

627
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:35,722
Why bother checking?

628
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:40,936
It’s short $50.

629
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,020
What?

630
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:49,361
That’s weird,
1 bill keeps slipping out.

631
00:42:51,238 --> 00:42:52,281
So embarrassing...

632
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,157
It really slipped.

633
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,663
Any keywords to look for?

634
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,458
‘Tokarev’ or ‘arms dealer’
and things like that.

635
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:10,465
What about this? ‘Broker?

636
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:11,675
When was the call made?

637
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,552
It was... 3 days ago.

638
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,929
Can you check
who owns that number?

639
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:18,056
I sure can, one sec.

640
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:25,272
If the owner made
online purchases,

641
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:26,231
we can get an address too.

642
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:27,441
Give me a sec.

643
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,863
It’s Seoul,
I’ll text you the address.

644
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:34,072
Okay.

645
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:35,365
Let’s go.

646
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,534
- Go now?
- Yup.

647
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:40,204
Could I use your washroom?
Where is it?

648
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,080
You can’t...

649
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,249
It’s clogged up,
so I poured Drano...

650
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:51,798
Could you go any faster?

651
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,800
- Why?
- Step on it!

652
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:55,344
I can’t!

653
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:58,805
City speed limit is 60km/h.

654
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:01,141
I hate breaking laws.

655
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,101
What’s with you?

656
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:05,312
I drank expired juice!

657
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:07,731
I didn’t drink any.

658
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,109
Can’t you install a GPS?

659
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,322
Special Forces men memorize
the map instantly.

660
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,533
I memorized Korea’s highway codes,

661
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,244
I don’t need GPS.

662
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:21,995
Shit...

663
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,038
SH-1?

664
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,458
Highway SH-1 goes from
Jeolla to Gurye.

665
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:29,378
Jesus Christ...

666
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:30,712
JC-8?

667
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:34,758
A Jincheon interchange into
the national highway.

668
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,764
Go left!

669
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:50,566
Oh man...

670
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,029
Dammit...

671
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,698
Maybe no one’s home,
let’s leave.

672
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,991
Go where?

673
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:06,415
It’s locked again.

674
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,416
Anyone home?

675
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:11,461
No one’s here,
move, I’ll open it for you.

676
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:13,505
Piss off!

677
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,894
Red flavor!
I’m curious, honey

678
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:37,571
Wow, chief!

679
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:38,989
Is this your new car?

680
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:40,282
It sure is.

681
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,242
It’s like a supercar.

682
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,077
Don’t touch, you’ll smudge...

683
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,455
Already got your fingerprints on it.

684
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,415
What’s the situation inside?

685
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:51,668
Gunshots everywhere,
it’s a chaos.

686
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:53,545
Chief.

687
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:55,589
Did you find something?

688
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,758
I got something to show you.

689
00:45:58,091 --> 00:45:58,842
Yeah?

690
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,762
This is outside the club
just before the shootout.

691
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:05,557
These two, don’t they
look like the tango couple?

692
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:09,102
I told you,
there’s something about them.

693
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,164
Did she clog it?

694
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:32,543
This was disguised as a suicide.

695
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:36,255
No signs of struggle,
this was done by pros.

696
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,925
What have you been eating?

697
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,427
It’s the body rotting stench.

698
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,597
What did you eat to make
your poop smell like a rotting body?

699
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:47,850
Like hell, it’s from
this body right here!

700
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:51,019
He didn’t die a long ago,
he can’t smell that bad.

701
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:54,606
Dammit!

702
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,067
Look at the blisters
by his bellybutton.

703
00:46:57,234 --> 00:47:00,028
It’s been at least 3 days,
don’t you know?

704
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:00,946
I know!

705
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,367
Something’s blocking
on the other side.

706
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:06,577
Move aside.

707
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:19,840
See that?

708
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:23,677
Watch and learn,
this is from years of...

709
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:25,846
experience...

710
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:28,974
Kim Yeong Gu,
head of security.

711
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,227
Mugwang International.

712
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:40,027
It’s an arms broker.

713
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:43,405
Is there a list of execs?

714
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:44,907
Let me look.

715
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,244
Yes, Director Jeon Hoon.

716
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,537
Director Jeon Hoon?

717
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:54,166
Director Jeon!
Park threatened him with a text.

718
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:55,584
So that’s the bastard.

719
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:57,920
There’s a high chance of that.

720
00:47:58,128 --> 00:47:59,963
Not just a chance,
it’s definitely him.

721
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:04,635
There’s a celebration
at Alvin Hotel tomorrow.

722
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:09,056
What celebration?

723
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:10,849
They invited overseas adoptees.

724
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,935
- So go there tomorrow?
- Of course.

725
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,355
Cloning Jeon’s phone
would be best.

726
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:19,691
No, there’s no time
to steal and return his phone.

727
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,777
Too dangerous, next plan.

728
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:26,031
What about luring him
with my femininity?

729
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,157
Too dangerous, next plan.

730
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:28,867
Why not?!

731
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,203
That plan only works
for real hotties.

732
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:33,372
I can’t believe what I’m hearing.

733
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:35,624
When I’m dolled up,

734
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:39,086
all the girls look like squids
in comparison.

735
00:48:40,295 --> 00:48:41,880
A plate of sausage, please.

736
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,733
I ordered too much,
please have some.

737
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:03,235
Sure.

738
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:08,365
You see that?

739
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:10,909
Femininity plan is
used by those girls.

740
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:13,912
It’s not like I want to do it!

741
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:15,038
Got anything else?

742
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:17,040
Attaching a bug on Jeon then.

743
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:18,125
You do it.

744
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:22,921
Don’t forget to wear a dress.

745
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,381
Dress again?

746
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:27,342
It’s a celebration,
we gotta look the part.

747
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:30,137
Don’t wear something stupid.

748
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:31,513
Look who’s talking.

749
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:35,601
Name, Wong Iring.

750
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,020
She currently goes by
Yoo Da-hee,

751
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:41,190
and grew up in Korea,
so her Korean is excellent.

752
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:43,692
She studied psychology
at Beijing University,

753
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:46,778
and has been working for MSS
for about 3 years now.

754
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,405
Very good.

755
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,534
As expected, they sent a rookie.

756
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,162
They’ll sacrifice a young elite,
and blame us for it.

757
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,334
Did the agent beside her
report back?

758
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:01,793
No, not yet, sir.

759
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:04,880
I made contact
and sent him a sign,

760
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:06,256
but nothing yet.

761
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,134
Make contact properly,
and request a sitrep.

762
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:11,595
But I...

763
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:14,806
don’t recognize him.

764
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:18,852
He’s not one of our agents?

765
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,271
Um...

766
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:23,190
Doe Du-ho

767
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:27,861
You’re not as good
as last time.

768
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:29,696
That was just a warm up.

769
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:34,701
Du-ho, isn’t your mom
coming soon?

770
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:36,745
No, she’ll be late today.

771
00:50:36,828 --> 00:50:39,581
Yeah? Here we go.

772
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,251
Why didn’t you swing?

773
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:43,335
Mom...

774
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,337
Du-ho! What are you doing?!

775
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,716
What if you get hurt?

776
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,431
I’m glad that I met
my husband,

777
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,101
and started a family because of you.

778
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,228
But please stay away now.

779
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:08,110
If he finds out that
you left his dad to die,

780
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:10,153
he’ll be torn apart.

781
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,657
I hope to never see you again.

782
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:19,621
How is he, by the way?

783
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,665
He’ll be fine after the surgery.

784
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:23,125
Oh...

785
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:29,214
Honey, let’s go.

786
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,009
Da-rong, that’s cheating!

787
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:16,011
You didn’t say it wasn’t allowed, Yuri.

788
00:52:20,057 --> 00:52:22,935
Xiao-rong, go to the ER tomorrow.

789
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:25,646
This is nothing at all.

790
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:26,605
Be a pro about it.

791
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,858
Get it treated so it won’t
affect your performance.

792
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:31,235
Yes, boss.

793
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,036
How can I help you?

794
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,496
Salute, good day, sir!

795
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,999
Bud, it’s been a few days
since I got this car.

796
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,668
Can’t you remember?

797
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:50,087
I will absolutely do so,
take care, sir.

798
00:52:59,388 --> 00:53:00,973
Chief, good afternoon.

799
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,100
- Afternoon.
- Sir.

800
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:03,934
Where are you off to?

801
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:05,310
We got a body.

802
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:07,729
Yeah?

803
00:53:21,952 --> 00:53:23,704
Where did you rent
this high school uniform?

804
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:25,664
What do you know about fashion?

805
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:27,791
This is a designer jacket!

806
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:32,796
Hand crafted by an Italian artisan.

807
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,215
Designer plaid!

808
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:40,262
They got designer table cloth,
that’s incredible.

809
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:44,474
You’re embarrassing us,
take that jacket off.

810
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,811
Dammit, fine,
I’ll take it off.

811
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:51,190
Don’t take it off!

812
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:52,691
Why? You said to take it off.

813
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,527
That’s even more embarrassing,
this isn’t a fan meeting!

814
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:00,908
Use this to cover it up.

815
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:07,372
Nag, nag, nag...

816
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:09,791
Happy?

817
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:10,792
So dumb...

818
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:15,672
Chicken skewer, yum.

819
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,217
Did you report it?

820
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,801
Huh? Report what?

821
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,346
We found that body,
it should be reported.

822
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:24,473
Oh that, I did it in the morning.

823
00:54:25,974 --> 00:54:27,643
Not with your phone,
I hope.

824
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:28,977
You take me for a fool?

825
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,523
I used a pay phone, duh.

826
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:35,567
No one knows we were there.

827
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:37,778
National ID: Woo Su-han

828
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,279
National ID: Woo Su-han
- Where did you find this?

829
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:41,240
It was on the floor
by the bedroom door.

830
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:44,993
Are they Hansel and Gretel
or something?

831
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,871
Bread crumbs are everywhere.

832
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:00,843
That’s him.

833
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:07,015
Using your femininity plan
would’ve bombed.

834
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,061
Shut up and get up.

835
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,145
Okay.

836
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:20,237
So where did we get
adopted to?

837
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:22,614
- I can’t speak English.
- So?

838
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:26,702
Where are you from, please?

839
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:28,537
Puerto Rico.

840
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:30,747
Puerto Rico?

841
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:34,960
My name is Jeon Hoon.

842
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:38,255
My name is Carlos Pellisiano.

843
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:41,675
And you?

844
00:55:42,926 --> 00:55:44,428
Olga Pellisiano.

845
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:49,349
I'm aware there's no case of
Korean adoption to Puerto Rico so far.

846
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:52,186
Did you immigrated
after adopted to US?

847
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:54,771
Yes!

848
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:57,482
Oh, I see.

849
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:01,236
They immigrated after
adoption to the US.

850
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:03,447
Have a nice day.

851
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,449
Thank you, thank you.

852
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:17,252
- Bye.
- Bye.

853
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:23,217
What’s with them?

854
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,762
Buncha crazies,
so disgusting.

855
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:32,184
You got quick hands.

856
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:33,477
Puerto Rico?

857
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,395
I sure can think on my feet.

858
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:37,272
What an idiot...

859
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:38,941
Puerto Rico!

860
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:50,661
Boss.

861
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:56,667
The Axe clan’s here.

862
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:00,796
- I’ll see you again.
- Thank you.

863
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:04,174
Yuri.

864
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,553
Da-rong, Xiao-rong.

865
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:19,147
Don’t I look so dope?

866
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:21,900
Did you come here to dine?

867
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:47,593
What’s going on?

868
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,514
There must be a misunderstanding.

869
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:54,224
Misunderstanding?

870
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:58,270
You dying here
is a misunderstanding.

871
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:00,522
Chop them down.

872
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,583
Easy, let’s all calm down!

873
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:22,044
It’s a misunderstanding.

874
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,506
There’s no need to fight.

875
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,758
Think this through.

876
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:30,385
Rage crimes are rampant now.

877
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:34,515
Those not in gangs
will readily buy guns.

878
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:36,975
Why’d we intentionally
start a war?

879
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:38,894
We’ll only become
a target of investigation.

880
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:54,743
So who killed our don?

881
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:58,997
Roman scholar Cicero said once,

882
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:01,375
“To whom is it a benefit?”

883
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:06,630
If Rodeo and Axe clans go to war,
who will benefit from it?

884
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,507
Gangbook bastards?

885
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:09,925
Good.

886
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,510
You know the answer.

887
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:14,012
Sons of bitches!

888
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:16,849
How much are the guns?

889
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,101
Depends on how many you order.

890
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:21,562
- 100 units.
- Very well.

891
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:25,399
As a condolence to your don,
I’ll only accept 80% of price tag.

892
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:26,859
Where is it?

893
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:29,987
Guns aren’t here,
I’ll transfer them tonight.

894
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,781
I’ll notify you the time
and address later.

895
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,252
Blood-sucking bastards...

896
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:50,507
Dirty bastards...

897
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:55,679
The handoff is tonight.

898
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:01,185
Are you listening?

899
01:00:01,894 --> 01:00:02,936
It’s beef!

900
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,731
Come on...

901
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:14,489
What’s wrong?

902
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:16,700
The guy who broke
his nose yesterday is here.

903
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:17,868
Which one?

904
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:20,454
He’s wearing the table cloth.

905
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:24,291
Oh, Puerto Rico.

906
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:27,002
We’re exposed,
we have to get out.

907
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:31,840
We gotta leave.

908
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:33,759
I didn’t have my dessert yet.

909
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,802
We’re exposed!

910
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:37,429
Exposed?

911
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:42,184
- Hurry up!
- I hear you!

912
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:54,988
- Come quietly.
- Okay!

913
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:57,991
- Hey!
- That bitch...

914
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,079
Goddamn!

915
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:11,505
You take him.

916
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:22,266
Take this!

917
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:27,396
You bastard!
Put that down!

918
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:29,815
It’s ho... cold...

919
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:40,260
Stay behind me.

920
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:41,803
I’ll take care of them.

921
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,398
At least walk the walk.

922
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,111
- Dope Woo P.I. Agency?
- Yes?

923
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,572
Why are you here?

924
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:03,825
If I tell you the truth,
will you let me go?

925
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:05,369
Of course.

926
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:12,209
You know head of security
Kim Yeong Gu?

927
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:14,169
Yes.

928
01:03:14,294 --> 01:03:17,130
She hired me to find him.

929
01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:19,633
Why?

930
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:24,388
She’s a gold digger.

931
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,808
She was going to scam him,
but got scammed instead.

932
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,020
A double scam,
can you believe it?

933
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:33,856
Her IQ must be pretty low.

934
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,943
So you came here to
meet Mr. Kim?

935
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,069
Yes, that’s right.

936
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,114
Then why were you at
the Axe clan HQ yesterday?

937
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,157
I was where yesterday?

938
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:51,665
You were at the scene
when the Axe clan don was shot.

939
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:57,337
That night club was
the Axe clan HQ?

940
01:03:57,629 --> 01:03:59,381
What happened was,

941
01:03:59,548 --> 01:04:03,343
we went there after seeing
Kim’s call log.

942
01:04:03,552 --> 01:04:04,845
You saw his call log?

943
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:05,804
Yes.

944
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,097
So you hacked his phone?

945
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,975
Sure, that wasn’t even work.

946
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,814
Then you saw other stuff
in the phone?

947
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,526
No, not at all.

948
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,528
How could you not see it?

949
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:23,238
She saw everything,
she knows it all!

950
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,117
What do you mean,
we saw it together.

951
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:29,119
No! My eyes are bad,
I need glasses to see!

952
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,412
I got distorted vision.

953
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,789
You scheming bastard!
You paid you so much!

954
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:36,418
Like a real gold digger,
she’s got a foul temper.

955
01:04:36,502 --> 01:04:39,546
I’m doing this to make money,
but it’s nonstop stress.

956
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:41,131
It’s really hard!

957
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,342
So, Carlos...

958
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:48,347
I mean, Mr. Woo,
you don’t know Mr. Kim at all?

959
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,015
That’s correct.

960
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:55,062
You can ask the gold digger
for more detail.

961
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:57,814
May I leave now?

962
01:04:58,607 --> 01:04:59,483
Great.

963
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:02,027
Thank you.

964
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,788
Could you do me a favor though?

965
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:15,332
If you do,
I’ll let you both go.

966
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,807
See that police substation?

967
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,728
Go and kill all police officers there.

968
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:42,985
Kill police officers?

969
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:44,945
Don’t feel too bad.

970
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,905
They’ll die in the line of duty,

971
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,575
and their families will
receive special pension.

972
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,829
It wasn’t a simple arms smuggling?

973
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,497
None of your business.

974
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:59,626
If you run off,
we will kill you.

975
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:11,305
If you want to live,
do as I say.

976
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,234
Don’t be scared,
you got enough ammo.

977
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:32,910
Good.

978
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:45,297
Shots fired, suspect on the run,
plate number 43J-6449!

979
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,674
Black K5, I repeat,
43J-6449!

980
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,071
Can I help you?

981
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,168
Hands up!

982
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:27,130
Drop the gun!

983
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:46,191
Christ...

984
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:52,656
So you were investigating
an arms trafficking,

985
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:54,658
and they captured
your NIS agent partner?

986
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,534
Yes.

987
01:07:57,286 --> 01:07:58,579
That’s huge.

988
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:03,709
Give her a call,
put it on speaker.

989
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:08,672
She certainly can’t answer,
she’s in captivity.

990
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:12,426
That’s why give it a try,
just humor me.

991
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:15,929
You really don’t get it,
she’s captured.

992
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:18,432
Just watch.

993
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:19,725
Yoo Da-hee

994
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:23,061
Huh?

995
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:24,021
Hello?

996
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:29,568
Where are you? You okay?

997
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,111
Of course I’m okay.

998
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,279
What’s up?

999
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,282
You’re captured!

1000
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:37,659
What do you mean?
I’m on my way home.

1001
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:38,660
What?

1002
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:40,996
And don’t call me anymore.

1003
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,332
How many Yangpyeong soups
did we have already?

1004
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:44,958
6 times, 6!

1005
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:48,587
I like Guksu noodles,
but we never had it once!

1006
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:50,172
What are you talking...

1007
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,966
Forget it, don’t call me anymore.

1008
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,551
Yoo Da-hee, hey!

1009
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:58,180
She answers just fine,
you can now relax.

1010
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:00,891
NIS agent, huh?

1011
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:04,603
Why’d an NIS agent
work with a private dick?!

1012
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:07,981
Chief, we got a visit from NIS.

1013
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:13,612
NIS?

1014
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,995
Please excuse us.

1015
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,630
It’s been a while, Sgt. Woo.

1016
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:36,635
You headed up my rescue op
in Thailand.

1017
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:39,471
Right...

1018
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:45,394
I’m very regretful about
the accident that took place.

1019
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:49,147
An order, you mean,
not accident.

1020
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:57,114
Are you here about that?

1021
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:58,782
No, not at all.

1022
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,909
I need to confirm a few things.

1023
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:04,580
Is your name Woo Su-han?

1024
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:05,747
Yes.

1025
01:10:05,831 --> 01:10:08,834
Were you dishonorable discharged
from Special Force 707?

1026
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,002
Yes.

1027
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,796
Do you know this woman?

1028
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,923
Yes, Yoo Da-hee.

1029
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:17,217
How did she identify herself as?

1030
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,677
She didn’t identify herself.

1031
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:20,971
Where did you think
she belonged to?

1032
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:23,223
She’s not one of yours?

1033
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:24,933
She’s not our agent.

1034
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:26,894
Defense Security Command?

1035
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,770
She’s a Chinese MSS agent.

1036
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,316
Chinese intelligence?

1037
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:36,987
Why’d a Chinese agent come
to stop arms trafficking here?

1038
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:38,947
So?

1039
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:42,743
Over 93% chance that
he’s not lying.

1040
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:45,954
I see.

1041
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:48,248
Very well.

1042
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,001
Although you’ve assisted
a foreign intelligence agent,

1043
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:54,046
you have not caused any harm
to our national interest.

1044
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:56,924
However, you will be
legally responsible

1045
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:58,884
for your actions thus far.

1046
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:01,720
I’m sorry that
I could not assist you.

1047
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:08,852
You guys knew guns were
being smuggled into our country.

1048
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:11,772
Why didn’t you stop it?

1049
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,107
And Yoo Da-hee?

1050
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:25,369
She was sent here
as a sacrifice.

1051
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:28,997
She might not know
but her mission is to die.

1052
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:31,708
And you’ll let her die?

1053
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,545
Why should we take care
of a foreign agent?

1054
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,339
This will be like the Thai op.

1055
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,592
Situation is a bit different.

1056
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:41,969
She’s not one of ours.

1057
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:43,387
Would it make a difference...

1058
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,306
if she was?

1059
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:56,066
We only act on behalf of
national interest.

1060
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:57,442
Take care.

1061
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:04,783
Please follow the protocol.

1062
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:10,080
What the hell...

1063
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:18,714
What did you talk about?

1064
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:20,674
It’s classified.

1065
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:21,925
Classified?

1066
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,221
I have to whisper it.

1067
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,390
What for? It’s only us here.

1068
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:29,850
We’re being recorded.

1069
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,728
You’re a nobody,
we don’t record everyone.

1070
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:33,896
Then I won’t tell you.

1071
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:43,655
Interrogation Room

1072
01:12:45,157 --> 01:12:46,491
We can’t do that nowadays...

1073
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:47,367
How about team dinner tonight?

1074
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,411
- I got dinner plans.
- Me too.

1075
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:51,330
- All right, I’m buying.
- Hot pot for me.

1076
01:12:51,622 --> 01:12:52,539
I’m in.

1077
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:53,832
Mr. Woo!

1078
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:56,585
What you’re doing is
a serious offense.

1079
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,969
What the hell do you want?

1080
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:07,346
Car key.

1081
01:13:07,846 --> 01:13:10,474
You think we’ll cooperate with you?

1082
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:12,518
I’m a Korean police officer!

1083
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:16,021
Please give him a key.

1084
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:17,981
I don’t have a car.

1085
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:19,775
Chief bought a new car.

1086
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:25,697
Ow...

1087
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:28,617
Oh yeah, my car...

1088
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,494
You left it here last night,
it’s in the parking lot.

1089
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:31,370
You frigging...

1090
01:13:52,558 --> 01:13:55,227
Hey! If you leave now,
you’re so screwed!

1091
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,112
Buddy! Stop that car!

1092
01:14:10,242 --> 01:14:12,035
He knows the car’s mine.

1093
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,454
He’ll stop it if the driver isn’t me.

1094
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:17,541
Salute! Take care, sir!

1095
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,299
Drive carefully, you mofo!

1096
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,433
How many Yangpyeong soups
did we have already?

1097
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:35,893
6 times, 6!

1098
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:39,062
I like Guksu noodles,
but we never had it once!

1099
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,151
Yeah, dude.

1100
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:48,030
Look for that company’s buildings
by Yangpyeong Route 6.

1101
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:49,656
They got 2 warehouses
in Yangpyeong.

1102
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,034
1 in Guksu county,
and 1 in Geumgok.

1103
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:54,912
It’s Guksu,
send me the address.

1104
01:14:58,207 --> 01:14:59,833
Pull out, I repeat,
pull out.

1105
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,251
An operator has been captured.

1106
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:02,920
Permission to rescue him, over.

1107
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:04,338
Shoot him, I repeat,

1108
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:06,381
shoot him and pull out, over.

1109
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,386
She was sent here
as a sacrifice.

1110
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,971
Her mission is to die.

1111
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:31,990
Gunshots were fired
in front of a Jungil police station

1112
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:33,867
at 3 PM today.

1113
01:15:34,117 --> 01:15:36,078
3 unidentified suspects
were shot and taken

1114
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,914
- Stupid idiots...- to the hospital...

1115
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:42,459
But at least he created
an aura of terror.

1116
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:44,670
Your ultimate goal was
to start a gang war,

1117
01:15:45,128 --> 01:15:46,713
and sell guns to them?

1118
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,716
I don’t think you’re a cop,

1119
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:52,219
NIS? DSC?

1120
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:55,681
Do you know what
Korea’s biggest problem is?

1121
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:59,017
Raising its citizens
in a nursery.

1122
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:02,855
It’s the safest country,
but government has no authority.

1123
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:05,858
The rich moans,
and has hissy fits,

1124
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:07,734
and the government babies them.

1125
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:11,238
Is there a future
for such a country?

1126
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,827
There’s an easy fix for that.

1127
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,413
Removing the nursery.

1128
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:24,209
“The world is dangerous,
act out and you’ll get hurt.”

1129
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:27,754
To do this, firearm usage
must be allowed.

1130
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:30,883
Trash those who voice rights
without any skills,

1131
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:35,345
they will shoot each other
and get killed.

1132
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,347
Kill and be killed,
kill and be killed!

1133
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,017
This is a revolution.

1134
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:43,979
A heart surgery for South Korea.

1135
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:00,579
They’ve arrived.

1136
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:05,042
What about the girl?

1137
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:08,378
It may cause problems

1138
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:10,547
if we kill her.

1139
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:12,466
Let’s give her to the gangsters.

1140
01:17:13,759 --> 01:17:17,346
It may not be comfortable,
but try to relax.

1141
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,444
All guns contain 8 bullets.

1142
01:17:32,569 --> 01:17:36,198
TT-33 models don’t have safety,
so please be careful.

1143
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:38,784
What a know-it-all.

1144
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:41,453
When I attended college
in Washington,

1145
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,581
I worked as an intern
at an arms association...

1146
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,124
I got it!

1147
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:49,837
I got it...

1148
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,177
And I got something
to test the guns.

1149
01:17:57,344 --> 01:18:00,764
She’s a cutie,
so kill her or take her.

1150
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:04,518
Interesting, good.

1151
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:09,147
Any updates from
Integrated Control Center?

1152
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,442
No, there’s too much traffic,
so it’ll take a while.

1153
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:13,819
Man...

1154
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,114
- Hands up!
- Yes, sir.

1155
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:20,701
I made 1 out of 60 payments...

1156
01:18:21,368 --> 01:18:22,244
Sons of bitches...

1157
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:25,998
I haven’t peeled all plastic...

1158
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,794
That looks important...

1159
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:37,009
It’s from DSC.

1160
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:38,093
I sent that request.

1161
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:39,428
Go take a look.

1162
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:43,265
What did you request?

1163
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:46,977
That bastard, Woo Su-han.

1164
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:48,979
I requested his service records.

1165
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:49,813
And?

1166
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,690
He’s ex-Special Forces 707.

1167
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:54,860
That idiot?

1168
01:18:57,321 --> 01:18:58,906
He was dishonorably discharged.

1169
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:00,866
What was the reason?

1170
01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:02,284
Disobeying an order, sir.

1171
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:05,037
Bastard, he did look disobedient.

1172
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:08,624
But isn’t 707 super hard
to get into?

1173
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:10,834
Right, it’s really hard.

1174
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,420
He didn’t work the mess
or the base exchange?

1175
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:14,671
No, sir.

1176
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:17,883
He was a close combat instructor.

1177
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,260
That dumbass?

1178
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:31,813
Xiao-rong, where you going?

1179
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:33,565
I thought I heard something.

1180
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:44,826
Chief!

1181
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:47,204
It’s okay, no one’s here.

1182
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:57,297
Sneakers over there.

1183
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:01,718
What took you so long?

1184
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:03,470
I got here as soon as possible.

1185
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,847
Cops?

1186
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:07,641
Don’t worry, I lost them,
I did good, right?

1187
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:09,518
Why didn’t you bring them?!

1188
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,020
How could I?
They’re after my ass!

1189
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:21,029
You’re not an NIS agent, right?

1190
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:22,990
Me? Why am I NIS?

1191
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:24,700
I knew it.

1192
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,995
I thought you were an NIS agent.

1193
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:31,248
Then why are you here?
All by yourself?

1194
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:36,837
Yoo Da-hee.

1195
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:41,133
I’m still owed $10,000.

1196
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:44,052
Only after the job!

1197
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:45,179
That’s why I came.

1198
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:48,182
I’ll take care of this,
so call it in.

1199
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,475
You nag even after
I rescue you?

1200
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:56,732
There’s no signal here.

1201
01:20:57,566 --> 01:20:59,234
Send a text,
it’ll work better.

1202
01:21:04,907 --> 01:21:06,366
Are you doing it on purpose?

1203
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:07,743
What?

1204
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:10,412
I don’t know what happened
in the past,

1205
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:15,334
but you’re acting shallow
to avoid getting hurt.

1206
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,050
You saw right through me,
I think so too.

1207
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:26,929
I shouldn’t have said anything.

1208
01:21:44,696 --> 01:21:46,323
Da-hee, got anything?

1209
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:47,366
What? Like what?

1210
01:21:51,828 --> 01:21:52,621
What do I...

1211
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:00,587
Chief, what are you doing?!

1212
01:22:00,879 --> 01:22:02,130
My eyes!

1213
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:07,052
Let’s go!

1214
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:23,360
It really stings...

1215
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:30,617
Is this the right way?

1216
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:32,369
How should I know?
It’s my first time here.

1217
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:40,878
- Da-hee.
- Yes?

1218
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:42,838
Stay back.

1219
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:41,396
Let’s go.

1220
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:00,749
Xiao-rong!

1221
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:03,544
What’s going on?

1222
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:06,797
I think we have uninvited guests.

1223
01:24:08,257 --> 01:24:11,593
To test these guns out,
mind if we go on a hunt?

1224
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,762
Certainly, enjoy.

1225
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:27,526
Da-rong, he’s dead.

1226
01:24:33,532 --> 01:24:34,449
Da-rong...

1227
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,245
I’m gonna kill him myself!

1228
01:24:49,715 --> 01:24:50,841
They’re looking for someone.

1229
01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:52,676
They’re looking for us.

1230
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:01,143
What the!

1231
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:36,970
Hey!

1232
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:40,224
What happened?

1233
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:42,059
That was not even work.

1234
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:48,190
Da-hee, got a text from cops.

1235
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,108
Cops? They’re on the way?

1236
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:51,527
They found the bitch.

1237
01:25:52,528 --> 01:25:53,487
Which bitch?

1238
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:56,490
That woman’s,
the missing dog.

1239
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:58,951
That retriever? Dorothy?

1240
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:00,953
I’m so glad they found her.

1241
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:03,789
Who cares, we’re in danger!

1242
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:05,582
Don’t worry.

1243
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:09,456
Toss your gun.

1244
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:14,044
If you do, we’re both dead.

1245
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:20,217
Then let’s begin
with a bullet in her.

1246
01:28:26,765 --> 01:28:29,142
One in the chamber, asshole!

1247
01:28:29,393 --> 01:28:30,727
Toss your gun!

1248
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:41,460
I’m Yuri.

1249
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:43,128
Yeri?

1250
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,012
Me, Seulgi.

1251
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,265
What do you mean?

1252
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:58,268
He must be a Red Velvet fan too.

1253
01:31:58,352 --> 01:31:58,894
What?!

1254
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:02,898
Let’s duel it out.

1255
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:03,941
Seulgi.

1256
01:32:05,943 --> 01:32:07,361
What about Seulgi?

1257
01:32:10,906 --> 01:32:12,282
I’ll lend you mine.

1258
01:32:15,869 --> 01:32:18,330
Holy crap, he almost got me.

1259
01:32:19,623 --> 01:32:22,709
No, I think he tossed you one
to have a duel with you.

1260
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,556
What a weirdo,
why’d anyone do a duel?

1261
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:54,283
Hey! Think this through.

1262
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:56,827
With someone of your caliber,
we can start a revolution.

1263
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:59,204
And I’ll pay you whatever.

1264
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:01,623
Revolution? What revolution?

1265
01:33:02,374 --> 01:33:03,959
He wants to flood Korea with guns.

1266
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:06,420
For what?

1267
01:33:06,712 --> 01:33:09,089
We can clean up trash
who’re polluting this country.

1268
01:33:09,548 --> 01:33:10,799
That’s what I’m doing.

1269
01:33:11,508 --> 01:33:14,094
No, not us!

1270
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:16,597
We are revolutionists,
the real trash!

1271
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:19,224
Unskilled, dormant criminals!

1272
01:33:19,558 --> 01:33:21,977
We can clean up those trash!

1273
01:33:24,021 --> 01:33:25,063
Elaborate.

1274
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:28,442
Those who pollute Korea
for their right to vote!

1275
01:33:28,567 --> 01:33:30,569
We must eradicate those trash!

1276
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:31,528
Hey!

1277
01:33:35,115 --> 01:33:37,451
You sure like to talk.

1278
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:39,244
No, it’s not that...

1279
01:33:39,578 --> 01:33:41,205
I don’t know why I’m here...

1280
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:43,123
Dump him in the toilet.

1281
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:47,961
I’m really sorry.

1282
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:51,131
Couldn’t I just get
a beating here?

1283
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:53,842
I’ll gladly get a beating!

1284
01:33:53,926 --> 01:33:55,344
Please no!

1285
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,889
Although it wasn’t intentional,

1286
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:02,434
my bosses are happy
about wrapping up this case

1287
01:34:02,518 --> 01:34:04,228
as a joint op with China.

1288
01:34:04,478 --> 01:34:05,812
Then get me out of here.

1289
01:34:06,522 --> 01:34:08,899
You stir up way too much
trouble for us to do that.

1290
01:34:09,983 --> 01:34:11,568
There is one way though.

1291
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:12,361
What?

1292
01:34:13,946 --> 01:34:15,781
Become our covert agent.

1293
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:18,283
You want me to
become an NIS agent?

1294
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:22,454
We received another request
for a joint op with China.

1295
01:34:22,538 --> 01:34:25,666
We believe you are perfect for it.

1296
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,709
Are you nuts?
Do that again?

1297
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:29,795
No way, I’m not doing it.

1298
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:33,882
You’ll be stuck here for a while...

1299
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:38,136
Wait, I stopped guns from
flooding our country...

1300
01:34:38,387 --> 01:34:41,890
- It should be an extenuating...
- Assault, bodily harm, murder,

1301
01:34:42,057 --> 01:34:45,686
impersonating an officer, break-in,
obstruction of justice, damage to...

1302
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:47,437
So damn much...

1303
01:34:47,688 --> 01:34:50,899
Even with an extenuating circumstance,
you’ll get 10 years minimum.

1304
01:34:52,568 --> 01:34:54,736
I’d rather stay here for 10 years.

1305
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,488
I almost died so many times!

1306
01:34:57,322 --> 01:34:58,198
I’m not doing it.

1307
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,075
Never, ever.

1308
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:07,249
$100,000 retainer.

1309
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,460
Another $100,000
upon completion of the op.

1310
01:35:12,045 --> 01:35:13,213
Deal!

1311
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:18,844
Pediatric Cancer Ward

1312
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:20,679
Ma’am?

1313
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,099
Yes?

1314
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:25,976
Sorry to bother you.

1315
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:27,644
I need to get your signature.

1316
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:29,313
For what?

1317
01:35:29,688 --> 01:35:33,150
Before we fix the surgery date,
the guardian needs to sign off.

1318
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,819
Surgery date?

1319
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:38,488
You decided to have it.

1320
01:35:38,572 --> 01:35:40,908
Surgery was already paid for.

1321
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:48,707
I’m so thankful that
you resolved the incident.

1322
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:51,293
No, we’re the one in your debt.

1323
01:35:55,172 --> 01:35:55,797
Eh?

1324
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:00,385
It’s been a while.

1325
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:01,929
As you may already know,

1326
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:04,473
he’s your partner agent
for this joint op.

1327
01:36:04,556 --> 01:36:06,433
Good to meet you,
I’m Agent Chao.

1328
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:07,601
Woo Su-han.

1329
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:09,978
“Agent”?

1330
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:12,481
It worked out that way.

1331
01:36:12,606 --> 01:36:16,777
What happened to Agent Ama?
I can’t reach him.

1332
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,987
We are actively searching for him.

1333
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:24,451
Could it be related
to the missing Dorothy case?

1334
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:27,621
We must approach it
from that angle.

1335
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:28,539
Dorothy?

1336
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:32,459
Who exactly is Dorothy?

1337
01:36:34,253 --> 01:36:39,007
A codename for
a former KGB informant.

1338
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:44,388
She was to hand over
a North Korea intel to Agent Ama,

1339
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:46,765
but both are unreachable.

1340
01:36:47,099 --> 01:36:50,853
How was she supposed to
hand it over?

1341
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:53,272
Dorothy loves gold,

1342
01:36:53,397 --> 01:36:57,568
so she normally imbeds
micro SD card inside a gold bar.

1343
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:02,698
Where’s the gold pig?

1344
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:05,534
- I sold it.
- What?

1345
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:06,326
Pardon?

1346
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:07,828
- It’s nothing.
- Nothing, sir.

1347
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:11,123
You are to disguise
as a couple and infiltrate

1348
01:37:11,206 --> 01:37:14,168
the place where we think
they’re in captivity.

1349
01:37:14,293 --> 01:37:15,169
- A couple?
- A couple?

1350
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:16,920
You two are in sync.

1351
01:37:17,045 --> 01:37:17,629
- Of course not!
- Of course not!

1352
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:18,839
Didn’t you coordinate
your clothes today?

1353
01:37:18,922 --> 01:37:19,798
- No way!
- No way!

1354
01:37:19,882 --> 01:37:21,258
Totally in sync.

1355
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:28,599
Do we have to dress like this?

1356
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:32,769
It’s Vladivostok!
Russia is so cold!

1357
01:37:32,978 --> 01:37:36,356
Look around, no one’s
dressed like us.

1358
01:37:37,316 --> 01:37:40,360
They just don’t know!

1359
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:42,654
They might get off on route.

1360
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:45,866
Oh yeah.

1361
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:49,703
What was that text you got
from cops about finding the dog?

1362
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:52,873
It wasn’t Dorothy.

1363
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:55,375
How could you sell the gold pig?

1364
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:57,336
If you hadn’t sold it,
we’d be done by now.

1365
01:37:57,419 --> 01:37:59,713
Did you know?
That it had an SD card?

1366
01:37:59,796 --> 01:38:00,589
Was I the only one?

1367
01:38:00,672 --> 01:38:02,883
Then why not get it back?!

1368
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,220
They melted it down...

1369
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:09,640
You can’t do anything right...

1370
01:38:10,766 --> 01:38:12,434
When’s the informant coming?

1371
01:38:12,518 --> 01:38:14,686
The meeting point is
the cruise’s bow.

1372
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:20,984
Hello? Where are you?

1373
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:23,195
Behind me?

1374
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:26,990
There’s an ocean.

1375
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:29,284
What?

1376
01:38:33,914 --> 01:38:35,249
Why are you dressed like that?

1377
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:38,460
We’re taking this boat?

1378
01:38:38,752 --> 01:38:40,128
We have to go in stealthily.

1379
01:38:40,796 --> 01:38:42,422
I knew it.

1380
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:49,930
Can we really get there
on this boat?

1381
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:51,390
We’ll find out soon.

1382
01:38:51,557 --> 01:38:53,475
What? What the hell?!

1383
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:53,892
What? What the hell?!
KIM YOUNG-GWANG

1384
01:38:53,892 --> 01:38:58,313
KIM YOUNG-GWANG

1385
01:38:59,106 --> 01:39:03,694
LEE SUN-BIN

1386
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:10,033
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY
KIM HYUNG-JOO

1387
01:39:13,203 --> 01:39:17,374
So you don’t remember anything?

1388
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:21,879
No.

1389
01:39:21,962 --> 01:39:26,133
Any images that pop up?
Nothing like that?

1390
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:36,810
I see a man,
naked and tied to a chair.

1391
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:39,229
He was into BDSM...

1392
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:42,524
And a gun, knife and a needle,

1393
01:39:42,608 --> 01:39:44,318
I keep seeing those.

1394
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:46,987
He had constant suicidal thoughts.

1395
01:39:48,113 --> 01:39:52,367
If it’s okay,

1396
01:39:52,492 --> 01:39:56,788
I know someone who
may be able to help you.

1397
01:39:56,955 --> 01:39:58,624
Would you like to meet him?

1398
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:03,837
I’m sure it’s been tough.

1399
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:07,216
Perception’s gotten so much better.

1400
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:09,635
So don’t do anything regrettable.

1401
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:13,639
Here you were.
We found your family member.

1402
01:40:13,722 --> 01:40:14,306
Yeah?

1403
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:19,186
Honey! Honey! Honey!

1404
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:22,397
I looked everywhere for you!

1405
01:40:22,523 --> 01:40:24,900
Are you all right?

1406
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:26,318
“Honey”?

1407
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:29,071
Because I’m his wife.

1408
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:31,740
Not his aunt?

1409
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:35,369
You’re risking your life
with those words!

1410
01:40:36,411 --> 01:40:38,872
It’s obvious this is
very peculiar.

1411
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:42,292
Why’d this handsome man
marry someone like you?

1412
01:40:43,544 --> 01:40:46,129
What’d you even know
about women’s attraction?

1413
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:48,382
I really don’t get it.

1414
01:40:49,216 --> 01:40:51,134
Honey, let’s go somewhere else.

1415
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:54,555
You had women trouble in the past,
but now men too?

1416
01:40:54,638 --> 01:40:56,265
Where are you going?

1417
01:40:56,348 --> 01:40:59,852
Our home, of course,
none of your business!

1418
01:40:59,935 --> 01:41:03,772
How could we trust him
with a suspicious woman?

1419
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:06,608
Suspicious? We’re married!

1420
01:41:06,692 --> 01:41:08,652
You’re at least 20 years older!

1421
01:41:08,735 --> 01:41:11,613
I get Botox regularly!

1422
01:41:11,738 --> 01:41:13,949
Honey! Where are you going?!

1423
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:14,992
Careful!
