160
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,130
我以为一切都安排好了。
I thought it was all arranged.

161
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,716
哦,从昨天!
Oh, from yesterday!

162
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,095
难道你不了解我的船长吗?
Don’t you know my captain well?

163
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:32,391
我想你可以这么说，但不是真的，
I guess you could say that, but not really,

164
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,101
我甚至不知道他的名字。
I don’t even know his name.

165
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,230
对，这说得通。
Right, that makes sense.

166
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:41,692
你昨天听到什么了?
What did you hear yesterday?

167
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:46,405
利用这个空间，除掉一些害虫。
To use this space, and to get rid of some pest.

168
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,616
这次不需要了。
That won’t be necessary this time.

169
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,451
这不是暗杀任务。
This isn’t an assassination mission.

170
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,622
我只需要收集一些情报让警察接手。
I just need to gather some intel and let the police take over.

171
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,874
暗杀?
Assassination?

172
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,085
-这是预付款。-有误会…
- Here’s the advance. - There’s misunderstanding...

173
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,089
误解?
Misunderstanding?

174
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,968
没什么。
It’s nothing.

175
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:13,432
我不是那种没有预付全薪就不工作的人……
I’m not someone who doesn’t work without a full pay upfront...

176
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,435
哦……
Oh...

177
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,104
那我能平分一万美元吗?
Then can I pay $10,000 in halves?

178
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:23,775
不，这些很重，我买了。
No, these are heavy, I’ll take them.

179
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,610
一点也不重。
They’re not heavy at all.

180
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,445
不,没关系!
No, it’s okay!

181
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,704
你叫吴素汉?
Your name is Woo Su-han?

182
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,830
是的。
Yes.

183
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:41,293
我得看起来像在这里工作的，所以我能叫你“老板”吗?
I need to look like I work here, so can I call you ‘boss’?

184
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,462
这有点太多了……
That’s a bit much...

185
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,298
“Chief”更合适。
‘Chief’ would be more appropriate.

186
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,759
好吧,局长。
Okay, chief.

187
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,761
你叫什么名字?
What’s your name?

188
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,012
Yoo Da-hee,先生。
Yoo Da-hee, sir.

189
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,016
你可以畅所欲言，毕竟我是你的雇员。
You can speak freely, I’m your employee after all.

190
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,851
好的,Da-hee。
Okay, Da-hee.

191
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:02,481
我不知道我到底是什么角色。
I didn’t hear about what my role is exactly.

192
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,649
我明白了。
I see.

193
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,485
简报室在哪里?
Where’s the briefing room?

194
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,445
简报室……
Briefing room...

195
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,279
在那里!
There!

196
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,326
你想让我简要介绍一下吗?
You want me to brief you on that?

197
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,118
为什么不呢?
Why not?

198
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,329
这里的安全没有保障。
Security isn’t guaranteed here.

199
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,331
一切都很好，几乎没有人来。
It’s all good, barely anyone comes by.

200
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,805
我能把这些扔掉吗?
Can I throw these out?

201
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,056
什么?
What?

202
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,225
不!
No!

203
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:39,893
圣牛……
Holy cow...

204
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,316
我等了很久才得到这张签名。
I waited a long time to get this autograph.

205
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,610
有新的吗?
Got a new one?

206
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,112
给我，等等。
Give it, hold on.

207
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,118
你喜欢吗?
You’re into that?

208
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,497
不，这是我收集的证据。
No, it’s a piece of evidence I collected.

209
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,291
别担心。
Don’t worry about it.

210
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,632

00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,032
继续下去。

这地方不安全。

222
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,457
他只是个房东，这对他来说不合理。
He’s just a landlord, this doesn’t make sense to him.

223
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,047
我刚才说他是谁来着?
Who did I say this guy was?

224
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,635
那是什么，他进口稀有物品。
What was it, he imports rare items.

225
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,594
罕见的物品吗?

00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,972
虾，龙虾之类的。

227
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,641
稀土元素。
It’s rare-earth elements.

228
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,601
你只对了“rare”。

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,355
不管怎样，几天前，他们偷运了…

00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,227
首席。

这么大规模的案子应该由警察来处理!

但警察只有在有证据的时候才会介入。

268
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,825
根本没有证据，所以我们要介入!

难怪他们花这么多钱…

281
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,737
我们所做的是违法的。
What we do is illegal.

282
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,739
那听起来不错。
That sounds right.

283
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,783
但是你会跳探戈吗?
But do you know how to tango?

284
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:08,453
是的，我学了基础知识。
Yes, I learned the basics.

285
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,455

我需要穿它去训练吗?
Do I need to wear it to a practice?

291

你游泳时不穿泳衣吗?
Do you not wear a swimsuit when swimming?

292
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:29,766

寄来:全先生，现在联系不上你。
Sent: Mr. Jeon, you’re not reachable.

316
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,242
如果你今天不回答，我就报警。
If you don’t answer by today, I’ll call the police.

317
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:04,922
我的歉意。
My apologies.

318
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,702
噢我的天!
Oh my!

319
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:37,955
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

320
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,373
你还好吗，帕克先生?
Are you okay, Mr. Park?

321
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,751
我很好……
I’m fine...

322
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,422
是的，我在café。
Yeah, I’m at the café.

323
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,719
什么?你什么意思?
What? What do you mean?

324
00:25:56,682 --> 00:25:57,975
你在干什么?!
What were you doing?!

325
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,659
朴先生!
Mr. Park!

326
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,829
李老师，请帮帮我!
Ms. Lee, please help!

327
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:27,004
911年?请派人帮忙，一个人倒下了。
911? Please send help, a man collapsed.

328
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,134
他已经死了，我们得走了。
He’s already dead, we need to go.

329
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,136
我们为什么要呢?
Why should we?

330
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,138
警察一来，事情就会变得一团糟。
Things will get messy when the police arrive.

331
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,974
不，现在走会起疑心的。
No, we’d be suspicious if we leave now.

332
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,893
你确定这样可以吗?
You sure this is okay?

333
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,229
我们什么都没做，别担心。
We didn’t do anything, don’t worry about it.

334
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,904
所以…你们两个认识吗?
So... do you two know each other?

335
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:52,946
——是的。——没有。
- Yes. - No.

336
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,284
你们到底认识不认识?
So do you know each other or not?

337
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,329
我们彼此不认识
We didn’t know each other,

338
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:04,208
但我们今天认识了，所以我们现在认识了。
but got acquainted today, so we do now.

339
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,919
今天开会……
Met today...

340
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,630
-吴素汉先生?——是吗?
- Mr. Woo Su-han? - Yes?

341
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,131
你开私人侦探事务所?
You run a private detective agency?

342
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,090
是的。
Yes.

343
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:14,218
你去探戈café是为了调查某人吗?
Were you at the tango café to investigate someone?

344
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,513
不，这是我的爱好，学习英语。
No, it’s my hobby, to learn it.

345
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:19,139
爱好……
Hobby...

346
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,308
还有Yoo Da-hee女士。
And Ms. Yoo Da-hee.

347
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,267
是吗?
Yes?

348
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:25,437
今天是你第一次上探戈课?
It was your first tango session today?

349
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:26,522
是的。
Yes.

350
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,942
但你们两个都盛装打扮…
But you two are all dressed up...

351
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,486
对吧?尴尬的,不是吗?
Right? Awkward, no?

352
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,572
她为什么盛装出席第一次治疗?
Why is she all dressed up to her first session?

353
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:37,658
与手套!
With gloves too!

354
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,703
至少把你的领结摘下来!
At least take your bow tie off!

355
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:48,252
但为什么要调查我们?
But why are we getting investigated?

356
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,338
因为人们觉得你们俩很可疑。
Because people thought you two were suspicious.

357
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,257
——谁?——每一个人。
- Who? - Everyone.

358
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,885
但这并不意味着我们会被指控犯罪。
But that doesn’t mean we’re charged with a crime.

359
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:01,682
没错，他的死因也是心脏病发作。
Right, and his cause of death was heart attack too.

360
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,601
-那我们能走了吗?——是的。
- So can we leave? - Yes.

361
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:05,894
谢谢你！
Thank you!

362
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,238
长官，他们是不是有点可疑?
Sir, aren’t they a bit suspicious?

363
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:18,699
你没有这样的经历，
You don’t have the experience to feel that way,

364
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:20,909
如果你变得像我一样，你会发展直觉。
if you become like me, you’ll develop intuition.

365
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,328
进一步研究这两个人。
Look into those two further.

366
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,621
先生?为什么?
Sir? Why?

367
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,249
他们发现了一些东西，我感到兴奋。
They got something, I’m getting tingly.

368
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,671
所以我们的工作结束了?
So our work’s done?

369
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:33,672
所以如何?
How so?

370
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,340
目标已经死了。
The target’s dead.

371
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:38,969
帕克肯定是被人利用后被杀的。
Park must’ve been used and killed afterwards.

372
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,763
拜托，你也听到了，是心脏病发作。
Come on, you heard him, it was a heart attack.

373
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:46,685
高剂量的氯化钾可以诱发这种症状，但不会产生任何痕迹。
High doses of potassium chloride could induce it with no trace.

374
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,687
你不知道吗?
You didn’t know?

375
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,356
我当然知道。
Of course I knew.

376
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,193
这意味着有专业人士参与其中。
It means professionals got involved.

377
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:58,155
所以我们应该报告此事，退后一步。
So we should report this and take a step back.

378
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,115
退一步做什么?
Step back from what?

379
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,242
如果你不想要这份工作，就把预付款退回去。
If you don’t want the job, return the advance.

380
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:05,871
我只是在考验你的毅力。
I was just testing your tenacity.

381
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,955
你才不会呢。
Like hell you did.

382
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,124
别告诉别人，我能听见。
Keep those words to yourself, I can hear them.

383
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,585
是吗，你克隆了手机吗?
Oh yeah, did you clone the phone?

384
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:17,799
它……是翻盖手机。
It... was a flip phone.

385
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,718
所以呢?你不能吗?
So? You couldn’t?

386
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,220
插头插错了!
It had the wrong plug!

387
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,805
你也没说过会是翻盖手机!
And you never said it was going to be a flip phone!

388
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:25,307
现在人人都在用智能手机。
Everyone uses smartphones now.

389
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,184
那通话记录呢?
What about the call logs?

390
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,477
我看到了。
I saw.

391
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:32,189
他给一个叫Mr。全的最近,
He texted someone called ‘Mr. Jeon’ recently,

392
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,483
如果联系不到全，他就会报警。
he was going to call the cops if Jeon wasn’t reachable.

393
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,693
你记住号码了吗?
Did you memorize the number?

394
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,321
你没有吗?
You didn’t?

395
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:43,367
他们都用一次性手机，为什么还要记?
They all use burner phones, why bother memorizing it?

396
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,994
军火商肯定用燃烧器，为什么要用自己的?
Arms dealer must use burners, why’d he use his own?

397
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,539
我们今天到底做了什么?
So what the hell did we do today?

398
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,461
顺便问一下，我应该在哪里下车?
By the way, where should I drop you off?

399
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:56,630
在车站前面。
In front of the station.

400
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,048
——哪个站?——Daerim。
- Which station? - Daerim.

401
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,341
那太远了!
That’s too far!

402
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,759
那你为什么要问?
So why did you ask?

403
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:02,886
我以为你会说"最近的地铁站"
I thought you’d say “Closest subway station”!

404
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,680
我怎么能穿成这样坐地铁?
How could I hop on a subway in this?

405
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,348
那你为什么穿成那样?
So why did you dress like that?

406
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:09,268
我穿成这样是因为某人!
I dressed like this because of someone!

407
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,398
是关于和我一起工作的探员。
It’s about the agent I’m working with.

408
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,525
我觉得他不是特工。
I don’t think he’s an agent.

409
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:20,487
这就是他的天赋，没人知道他是特工。
That’s his talent, no one knew he was an agent.

410
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,740
他的代号是Ama Zing是有原因的。
His codename is Ama Zing for a reason.

411
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:26,326
我明白了。
I understand.

412
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:40,591
所以他没有任何身份证明吗?
So he had no ID or anything to identify him?

413
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,551
不，他一无所有
No, he had nothing,

414
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:44,595
他的手机也没有记录。
and his phone had no records.

415
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:46,847
顺便说一下,
By the way,

416
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:49,516
我想我最近见过他。
I think I saw him recently.

417
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:50,809
在哪里?
Where?

418
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,686
在YouTube上。
On YouTube.

419
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,938
他在和一个男人接吻，
He was on a Kiss Cam with a guy,

420
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,858
还在棒球赛上出柜了。
and outed as a gay at the baseball game.

421
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,195
它在网上走红。
It went viral online.

422
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,201
所以他试图撞到车里自杀?
So he attempted suicide by running into traffic?

423
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,244
这听起来似是而非的。
That sounds plausible.

424
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,830
这是不正确的……
That’s not right...

425
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,921
无论如何我都要救这个人。
I’m going to save this man no matter what.

426
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,340
坚持下去..
Hang in there.

427
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,344
你为什么迟到?
Why are you late?

428
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,138
工作,很明显。
Working, obviously.

429
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:31,934
丢失的小狗
Lost Puppy

430
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:34,269
我们也要这么做吗?
We have to do this too?

431
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,647
我们得到了报酬，所以是的。
We got paid, so yeah.

432
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:38,273
好吧。
All right.

433
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,901
你为什么在这里?我以为我们结束了。
Why are you here? I thought we were done.

434
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,822
你没看新闻吗?
You didn’t see the news?

435
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,202
牛仔黑帮老大被枪杀了。
Rodeo mob boss was shot to death.

436
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:51,995
昨晚。
Last night.

437
00:31:58,585 --> 00:31:59,545
得到他!
Get him!

438
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:02,923
然后呢?
Then what?

439
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,634
街上已经有枪了吗?
Guns are already on the streets?

440
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,011
这就是我们要查的。
That’s what we have to find out.

441
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:12,182
你认识和那个世界有联系的人吗?
Do you know anyone who’s connected to that world?

442
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,141
“那个世界”?
“That world”?

443
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,893
是的，暴徒和帮派。
Yeah, mobs and gangs.

444
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,104
我怎么知道，警察应该知道。
How do I know that, cops should though.

445
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:22,234
如果你不想工作，就把预付款掏出来。
If you don’t feel like working, cough up the advance.

446
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:24,736
我认识一位这方面的专家。
I know an expert in that world.

447
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,280
然后我们走吧!
Then let’s go!

448
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,240
它需要钱，这就是原因。
It costs money, that’s why.

449
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,075
多少钱?
How much?

450
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,160
2000美元。
$2,000.

451
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:39,543
在这里。
Here.

452
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,088
你确定吗?
You sure about this?

453
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,300
完全确定，他就像个算命先生。
Totally sure, he’s like a fortune teller.

454
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,263
好久不见了。
It’s been so long.

455
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,931
是的。
Yup.

456
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:56,518
我们真的遇到了一个真正的算命先生?
We actually came to a real fortune teller?

457
00:32:57,895 --> 00:33:00,981
他在黑帮里很有名，是个圈内人。
He’s famous among gangsters, he’s an insider.

458
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,775
今天什么风把你吹来了?
What brings you here today?

459
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,445
你的性兼容性?
Your sexual compatibility?

460
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:07,362
——不!——不!
- No! - No!

461
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,031
你确定吗?
You sure?

462
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:12,326
你们俩会制造一股旋风。
You two will create a whirlwind.

463
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,577
忘记这一点。
Forget that.

464
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,872
你最近听说过牛仔竞技会的事吗?
Did you hear anything about Rodeo mob lately?

465
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,624
你为什么这么问?!
Why do you ask?!

466
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,213
这只是1950美元。
That’s only $1,950.

467
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,177

00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:44,483
牛仔竞技俱乐部的老大突然跑来问我，

他是否注定要死于一颗子弹。
whether he was destined to die with a bullet.

472
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:48,487
你跟他说了什么?
What did you tell him?

473
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,406
我告诉他那是不可能的。
I told him that’d never happen.

475
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,079

00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:00,123
这是常识。
That’s common sense.

477
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,670
哦，不，不，不!
Oh no, no, no!

478
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:06,338
神圣的狗屎!我受骗的!
Holy shit! I’m so fucked!

479
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:09,591
你还听到什么了吗?
Did you hear anything else?

480
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,678
罗迪欧是否试图获得枪支?
Whether Rodeo was trying to acquire guns?

That’d never happen!

482
00:34:15,347 --> 00:34:18,058
Rodeo对江南区有很强的把握。

483
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,144
他们为什么故意让警察瞄准?

他们可以泄露对手的情报

他们是邪恶的帮派，不像其他帮派。

他们跟一个中国黑帮混在一起，

00:34:56,638 --> 00:35:01,268
如果是他们干的，一切皆有可能。

来吧，来吧。
Bring it, bring it.

00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,354
我很渴。

这饮料过期了!

501
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:22,039
孩子，果汁过期了，扔掉，好吗?
Kiddo, the juice is expired, throw them out, all right?

502
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,961
我们最好查查阿克斯家族。
We better look into the Axe clan.

503
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:29,463

走私者可能为了卖枪而发动一场帮派战争。

If Rodeo won’t budge, they’ll agitate the Axe clan.

506

Are you nuts?! You heard him!

507
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,601
他说他们很邪恶!
He said they’re vicious!

508
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,770
作为一个经验丰富的专家，你真是个胆小鬼。
You sure are a chicken for a seasoned expert.

509
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,730
我不相信。
I don’t believe it.

510
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,649
不是因为我是个胆小鬼
It’s not that I’m a chicken,

511
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:52,277
我只是不喜欢让一个业余爱好者跟着我。
I’m just not a fan of having an amateur tagging along.

512
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,531
别担心我，我能照顾好自己。

天啊，好吧，给我看看。
Jeez, all right, show me.

00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,335
如果我打了你，我们就去找阿克斯家族。
If I hit you, we’re going to the Axe clan.

518
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,087
很好,继续。
Fine, go ahead.

519
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,131
环路和街道完全不一样。

血迹吗?
Any blood stains?

523

我们是重案组的。
We’re from Major Crimes.

524
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,334
我之前已经跟警察谈过了。
I already talked to cops earlier.

525
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:50,669
不是我们。

最近有军火商来过吗?
Did an arms dealer come by recently?

527
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,381
不。
Nope.

528

我们已经逮捕了那个毒贩。
We’ve arrested that dealer.

529
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:03,265
那你为什么不去问他?
Why don’t you go ask him then?

530
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,977
如果你不合作，我们会逮捕你。
If you’re uncooperative, we will arrest you.

531

你有逮捕令吗?

532
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:13,358
帮派暴力是一部特殊的法律，所以不需要。
Gang violence is a special law, so it doesn’t need one.

533
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:14,443
不知道。
Didn’t know.

534
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,946
我受够了，把他铐起来，我们去警局审问他。
I’ve had it, cuff him, we’ll interrogate him at the station.

535
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,448

536
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,992
——是的,手铐。-我没有

00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:29,750
你怎么能不带一双来!
How could you not bring a pair?!

539
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,638

嫌疑人抱怨手铐伤害了他们的手腕，

541

所以我们在测试这对新鞋。

542
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,312
世界已经改善了，不是吗?
The world has improved, no?

543

保护罪犯的公民权利。

545
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,154
米兰达警告?
Miranda warning?

546
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,364
这不是在医学院做的吗?
Isn’t that done in medical school?

547
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:02,658
希波克拉底誓言。
That’s Hippocratic Oath.

548
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,828
米兰达警告，我知道。
Right, Miranda warning, I know.

549
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,748
你有权指定一名检察官。

你们俩不是警察，对吧?
You two aren’t cops, right?

553
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,589

00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:02,509
你去吧…
You go ahead...

559
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:03,886
我怎么能离开你呢?
How could I leave you?

560
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:06,388
我没事，你继续…
I’m okay, you go on...

561
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,269
到底是什么?
What the heck?

562
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,398
那不是你流鼻血的污渍吗?
Isn’t that your nosebleed smudge?

563
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,357
什么?
What?

564
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:20,736
该死的!
Dammit!

565
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,738
垃圾……
Crap...

你怎么这么久才来!
What took you so long!

567
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,166
去你的!
Screw you!

568
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,044
很好。
Very good.

569
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,228
这些家伙真是疯了。
These guys really are insane.

570

他们怎么能在朝鲜使用枪支?
How could they wield guns in Korea?

571
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,731
我差点就死了……
I almost died back there...

572
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:58,815

Do you know any hackers?

00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,817
黑客吗?对什么?
Hackers? What for?

574
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,194
我们得解开这个。
We have to unlock this.

00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:05,322
没必要解锁，我们不再需要它了。
No need to unlock it, we don’t need it anymore.

576
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,490

你可能没注意到，他们是专业人士。

他们用了双头钻床和莫桑比克钻床

580

带着消音器和亚音速弹药。

581
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,174
他们必须是有经验的雇佣兵。
They had to be experienced mercs.

582
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,884
那就叫增援!
Then call in the reinforcement!

583
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,427
不!我必须一个人做这件事!
No! I have to do this alone!

584
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:28,136
为什么?
Why?

585
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:31,306
我们只能自己做了。
We just have to do it ourselves.

586
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,685
如果没有，就把预付款掏出来。
If not, cough up the advance.

587
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,480
我烦透了，我要全咳出来!
I’m sick of it, I’ll cough it all up!

588
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:42,025
减去50%的聘金，费用和危险津贴，
Minus the 50% retainer, expenses and hazard pay,

589

我退2000美元，行吗?
I’ll return $2,000, happy?

590
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:45,320
你到底还不还啊!
So are you gonna pay back or not?!

591
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,406
我做了一些工作，我也需要得到报酬。
I did some work, I need to get paid too.

592
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:49,867
总之，我不干这活儿了，你得靠自己了。
Anyway, I’m out of this gig, so you’re on your own.

593
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,247
工作结束后我会多付一万美元。
I’ll pay $10,000 more after the job.

594
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,625
所以你需要一个黑客?
So you need a hacker?

595
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,085
我知道它。
I knew it.

596
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,130
这需要钱，仅此而已。
It costs money, that’s all.

597
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,423
多少钱?
How much?

598
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:05,591
约3000美元。
About $3,000.

599
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:06,592
3.
3...

600
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:14,099
别像以前那样吝啬50美元。
And don’t skimp $50 like before.

601
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,018
太尴尬了。
That was so embarrassing.

602
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:20,606
那是无心之过。
That was an honest mistake.

603
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:27,404
你在做生意吗?
Are you in business?

604
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:32,409
等等，等等，我在这里救不了你。
Hold on, hold on, I can’t save here.

605
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,498
我今天看了很多遍《你死了》。
I saw ‘You Died’ so many times today.

606
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:40,292
Yoo Da-hee吗?你们俩认识吗?
Yoo Da-hee? You two know each other?

607
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,210
你说什么?
Say what?

608
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,258
你什么时候拿到的?
When did you get that?

609
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:51,094
最近有一个展览。
There was a showcase recently.

610
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,888
嘿，能给我一个吗?
Hey, could I take one?

611
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,014
没有地狱。
Hell no.

612
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,849
上次我给了你一张音乐会的票。
I gave you a concert ticket last time.

613
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,392
哦是的…

这个我也要。
I’m gonna take this one too.

617
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,819
不，不要叫Seulgi，不要做混蛋!
No, not ‘Seulgi’, don’t be a bastard!

618
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,697
你喜欢耶丽，我拿到她的就给你。

我很高兴遇到了我的丈夫，

Da-rong,那是作弊!

你没说不允许，尤里。

你在哪儿租的校服?

813
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,527
更尴尬的是，这不是粉丝大会!

814
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:00,908
用这个把它盖起来。
Use this to cover it up.

815
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:07,372
唠叨,唠叨,唠叨……

我们发现了那具尸体，应该上报。

“对谁有好处?”

01:03:18,715 --> 01:03:19,633
为什么?
Why?

930
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:24,388
她是个拜金女。
She’s a gold digger.

931
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,808
她本来要骗他的，结果却被骗了。
She was going to scam him, but got scammed instead.

932
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:32,020
双重骗局，你能相信吗?
A double scam, can you believe it?

933
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:33,856
她的智商一定很低。
Her IQ must be pretty low.

934
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,943
你是来见金先生的吗?
So you came here to meet Mr. Kim?

935
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,069
是的,这是正确的。
Yes, that’s right.

936
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,114
那你昨天为什么去阿克斯家族总部?
Then why were you at the Axe clan HQ yesterday?

937
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,157
我昨天在哪?
I was where yesterday?

938
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:51,665
阿克斯家族的唐被枪杀时你也在现场。
You were at the scene when the Axe clan don was shot.

939
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:57,337
那家夜店就是阿克斯家族的总部吗?
That night club was the Axe clan HQ?

940
01:03:57,629 --> 01:03:59,381
发生了什么事,
What happened was,

941
01:03:59,548 --> 01:04:03,343
我们是在看到金的通话记录后才去的。
we went there after seeing Kim’s call log.

942
01:04:03,552 --> 01:04:04,845
你看到他的通话记录了吗?
You saw his call log?

943
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:05,804
是的。
Yes.

944
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,097
所以你黑了他的电话?
So you hacked his phone?

945
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:09,975
当然，那根本不是工作。
Sure, that wasn’t even work.

946
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,814
然后你在手机里看到了其他东西?
Then you saw other stuff in the phone?

947
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,526
不，一点也不。
No, not at all.

948
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,528
你怎么能看不见呢?
How could you not see it?

949
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:23,238
她什么都看到了，什么都知道!
She saw everything, she knows it all!

950
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,117
什么叫我们一起看的。
What do you mean, we saw it together.

951
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:29,119
不!我的眼睛不好，我需要眼镜才能看东西!
No! My eyes are bad, I need glasses to see!

952
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,412
我的视力被扭曲了。
I got distorted vision.

953
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,789
你诡计多端的混蛋!你付了这么多钱!
You scheming bastard! You paid you so much!

954
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:36,418
她的脾气很坏，像个拜金女。
Like a real gold digger, she’s got a foul temper.

955
01:04:36,502 --> 01:04:39,546
我做这个是为了赚钱，但压力太大了。
I’m doing this to make money, but it’s nonstop stress.

956
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:41,131
真的很难!
It’s really hard!

957
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,342
所以,卡洛斯……
So, Carlos...

958
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:48,347
我是说，吴先生，你根本不认识金先生吗?
I mean, Mr. Woo, you don’t know Mr. Kim at all?

959
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,015
这是正确的。
That’s correct.

960
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:55,062
你可以问拜金女更多的细节。
You can ask the gold digger for more detail.

961
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:57,814
我现在可以走了吗?
May I leave now?

962
01:04:58,607 --> 01:04:59,483
太好了。
Great.

963
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:02,027
谢谢你！
Thank you.

964
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,788
你能帮我个忙吗?
Could you do me a favor though?

965
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:15,332
如果你这么做了，我就放你们俩走。
If you do, I’ll let you both go.

966
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,807
看到那个派出所了吗?
See that police substation?

967
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:36,728
去杀了那里所有的警察。
Go and kill all police officers there.

968
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:42,985
杀警察?
Kill police officers?

969
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:44,945
别太难过。
Don’t feel too bad.

970
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,905
他们会因公殉职，
They’ll die in the line of duty,

971
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,575
他们的家人将得到特殊的养老金。
and their families will receive special pension.

972
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,829
不是简单的武器走私吗?
It wasn’t a simple arms smuggling?

973
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,497
不关你的事。
None of your business.

974
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:59,626
如果你逃跑，我们会杀了你。
If you run off, we will kill you.

975
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:11,305
如果你想活命，就照我说的做。
If you want to live, do as I say.

976
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,234
别害怕，你有足够的弹药。
Don’t be scared, you got enough ammo.

977
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:32,910
好。
Good.

978
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:45,297
开枪，嫌犯在逃，车牌号43J-6449!
Shots fired, suspect on the run, plate number 43J-6449!

979
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,674
黑色K5，重复，43J-6449!
Black K5, I repeat, 43J-6449!

980
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,071
我能为您效劳吗?
Can I help you?

981
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,168
举起手来!
Hands up!

982
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:27,130
放下枪!
Drop the gun!

983
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:46,191
基督…
Christ...

984
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:52,656
所以你当时在调查一起军火走私，
So you were investigating an arms trafficking,

985
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:54,658
他们抓了你的情报部门搭档
and they captured your NIS agent partner?

986
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,534
是的。
Yes.

987
01:07:57,286 --> 01:07:58,579
这是巨大的。
That’s huge.

988
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:03,709
给她打电话，开免提。
Give her a call, put it on speaker.

989
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:08,672
她肯定不能回答，她被囚禁了。
She certainly can’t answer, she’s in captivity.

990
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:12,426
所以你就试试吧，迁就我。
That’s why give it a try, just humor me.

991
01:08:13,135 --> 01:08:15,929
你真的不明白，她被抓了。
You really don’t get it, she’s captured.

992
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:18,432
只是看。
Just watch.

993
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:19,725
Yoo Da-hee
Yoo Da-hee

994
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:23,061
嗯?
Huh?

995
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:24,021
喂?
Hello?

996
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:29,568
你在哪里?你没事吧?
Where are you? You okay?

997
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,111
我当然没事。
Of course I’m okay.

998
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,279
有什么事吗?
What’s up?

999
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,282
你了!
You’re captured!

1000
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:37,659
你什么意思?我正在回家的路上。
What do you mean? I’m on my way home.

1001
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:38,660
什么?
What?

1002
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:40,996
别再给我打电话了。
And don’t call me anymore.

1003
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,332
我们已经喝了多少杨平汤了?
How many Yangpyeong soups did we have already?

1004
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:44,958
6 * 6 !
6 times, 6!

1005
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:48,587
我喜欢古苏面，但我们从来没吃过!
I like Guksu noodles, but we never had it once!

1006
01:08:48,712 --> 01:08:50,172
你在说什么…
What are you talking...

1007
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:52,966
算了吧，别再给我打电话了。
Forget it, don’t call me anymore.

1008
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,551
Yoo Da-hee,嘿!
Yoo Da-hee, hey!

1009
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:58,180
她回答很好，你现在可以放松了。
She answers just fine, you can now relax.

1010
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:00,891
NIS代理,是吗?
NIS agent, huh?

1011
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:04,603
为什么一个情报院特工要和一个私人鸡巴合作!
Why’d an NIS agent work with a private dick?!

1012
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:07,981
局长，情报院来找我们。
Chief, we got a visit from NIS.

1013
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:13,612
NIS吗?
NIS?

1014
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,995
请原谅我们。
Please excuse us.

1015
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,630
有一段时间了，吴军士。
It’s been a while, Sgt. Woo.

1016
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:36,635
你负责我在泰国的救援行动。
You headed up my rescue op in Thailand.

1017
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:39,471
对吧……
Right...

1018
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:45,394
我对发生的事故感到非常遗憾。
I’m very regretful about the accident that took place.

1019
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:49,147
你是说命令，不是意外。
An order, you mean, not accident.

1020
01:09:52,568 --> 01:09:57,114
你是为那件事来的吗?
Are you here about that?

1021
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:58,782
不，一点也不。
No, not at all.

1022
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,909
我需要确认几件事。
I need to confirm a few things.

1023
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:04,580
你叫吴素汉吗?
Is your name Woo Su-han?

1024
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:05,747
是的。
Yes.

1025
01:10:05,831 --> 01:10:08,834
你是不是被特种兵707开除了?
Were you dishonorable discharged from Special Force 707?

1026
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:10,002
是的。
Yes.

1027
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,796
你认识这个女人吗?
Do you know this woman?

1028
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,923
是的,Yoo Da-hee。
Yes, Yoo Da-hee.

1029
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:17,217
她如何确定自己的身份?
How did she identify herself as?

1030
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,677
她没有说明自己的身份。
She didn’t identify herself.

1031
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:20,971
你觉得她属于哪里?
Where did you think she belonged to?

1032
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:23,223
她不是你们的人?
She’s not one of yours?

1033
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:24,933
她不是我们的特工。
She’s not our agent.

1034
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:26,894
国防安全命令吗?
Defense Security Command?

1035
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,770
她是中国国安局的特工。
She’s a Chinese MSS agent.

1036
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,316
中国的情报?
Chinese intelligence?

1037
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:36,987
为什么一个中国特工来这里阻止武器走私?
Why’d a Chinese agent come to stop arms trafficking here?

1038
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:38,947
所以呢?
So?

1039
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:42,743
有93%的可能性他没有说谎。
Over 93% chance that he’s not lying.

1040
01:10:44,953 --> 01:10:45,954
我明白了。
I see.

1041
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:48,248
很好。
Very well.

1042
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,001
虽然你曾协助过外国情报人员，
Although you’ve assisted a foreign intelligence agent,

1043
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:54,046
你没有对我们的国家利益造成任何伤害。
you have not caused any harm to our national interest.

1044
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:56,924
但是，你要承担法律责任
However, you will be legally responsible

1045
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:58,884
为你迄今为止的行为道歉。
for your actions thus far.

1046
01:10:59,176 --> 01:11:01,720
很抱歉我不能帮助你。
I’m sorry that I could not assist you.

1047
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:08,852
你们知道有枪支走私到我们国家。
You guys knew guns were being smuggled into our country.

1048
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:11,772
你为什么不阻止它?
Why didn’t you stop it?

1049
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:14,107
Yoo Da-hee ?
And Yoo Da-hee?

1050
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:25,369
她是作为祭品被送到这里的。
She was sent here as a sacrifice.

1051
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:28,997
她可能不知道，但她的任务就是去死。
She might not know but her mission is to die.

1052
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:31,708
你会让她死吗?
And you’ll let her die?

1053
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,545
我们为什么要照顾外国代理人?
Why should we take care of a foreign agent?

1054
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,339
这就像泰国行动一样。
This will be like the Thai op.

1055
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,592
情况有点不同。
Situation is a bit different.

1056
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:41,969
她不是我们的人。
She’s not one of ours.

1057
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:43,387
会有区别吗?
Would it make a difference...

1058
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,306
如果她是吗?
if she was?

1059
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:56,066
我们只代表国家利益行事。
We only act on behalf of national interest.

1060
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:57,442
当心
Take care.

1061
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:04,783
请按规程办事。
Please follow the protocol.

1062
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:10,080
到底……
What the hell...

1063
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:18,714
你们都谈了些什么?
What did you talk about?

1064
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:20,674
这是机密。
It’s classified.

1065
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:21,925
分类?
Classified?

1066
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,221
我得小声说。
I have to whisper it.

1067
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,390
对什么?这里只有我们。
What for? It’s only us here.

1068
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:29,850
我们被记录下来。
We’re being recorded.

1069
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,728
你是个无名小卒，我们不会录每个人。
You’re a nobody, we don’t record everyone.

1070
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:33,896
那我就不告诉你。
Then I won’t tell you.

1071
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:43,655
审讯房间
Interrogation Room

1072
01:12:45,157 --> 01:12:46,491
现在我们做不到……
We can’t do that nowadays...

1073
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:47,367
今晚的团队晚餐怎么样?
How about team dinner tonight?

1074
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,411
-我有晚餐计划。——我也是。
- I got dinner plans. - Me too.

1075
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:51,330
-好吧，我请客。-给我来个火锅。
- All right, I’m buying. - Hot pot for me.

1076
01:12:51,622 --> 01:12:52,539
我在。
I’m in.

1077
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:53,832
胡国辉!
Mr. Woo!

1078
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:56,585
你的行为是严重的违法行为。
What you’re doing is a serious offense.

1079
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,969
你到底想要什么

01:24:51,008 --> 01:24:52,676
他们在找我们。
They’re looking for us.

1230
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:01,143
什么!
What the!

1231
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:36,970
嘿!
Hey!

1232
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:40,224
发生了什么事?
What happened?

1233
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:42,059
这甚至不是工作。
That was not even work.

1234
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:48,190
大熙，警察给我发了条短信。
Da-hee, got a text from cops.

1235
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,108
警察吗?他们已经在路上了?
Cops? They’re on the way?

1236
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:51,527
他们找到了那个婊子。
They found the bitch.

1237
01:25:52,528 --> 01:25:53,487
哪个婊子?
Which bitch?

1238
01:25:53,904 --> 01:25:56,490
那个女人的，失踪的狗。
That woman’s, the missing dog.

1239
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:58,951
寻回犬吗?多萝西?
That retriever? Dorothy?

1240
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:00,953
我很高兴他们找到了她。
I’m so glad they found her.

1241
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:03,789
管他呢，我们有危险!
Who cares, we’re in danger!

1242
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:05,582
别担心。
Don’t worry.

1243
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:09,456
把你的枪。
Toss your gun.

1244
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:14,044
如果你这么做，我们都死定了。
If you do, we’re both dead.

1245
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:20,217
那我们就从一颗子弹开始吧。
Then let’s begin with a bullet in her.

1246
01:28:26,765 --> 01:28:29,142
枪膛里有一个，混蛋!
One in the chamber, asshole!

1247
01:28:29,393 --> 01:28:30,727
把你的枪!
Toss your gun!

1248
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:41,460
我是尤里。
I’m Yuri.

1249
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:43,128
Yeri吗?
Yeri?

1250
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,012
我,Seulgi。
Me, Seulgi.

1251
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,265
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

1252
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:58,268
他一定也是红丝绒乐队的粉丝。
He must be a Red Velvet fan too.

1253
01:31:58,352 --> 01:31:58,894
什么? !
What?!

1254
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:02,898
让我们决斗到底。
Let’s duel it out.

1255
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:03,941
Seulgi。
Seulgi.

1256
01:32:05,943 --> 01:32:07,361
Seulgi呢?
What about Seulgi?

1257
01:32:10,906 --> 01:32:12,282
我把我的借给你。
I’ll lend you mine.

1258
01:32:15,869 --> 01:32:18,330
天啊，他差点就抓到我了。
Holy crap, he almost got me.

1259
01:32:19,623 --> 01:32:22,709
不，我觉得他扔给你一个是为了和你决斗。
No, I think he tossed you one to have a duel with you.

1260
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,556
真是个怪胎，为什么会有人决斗?
What a weirdo, why’d anyone do a duel?

1261
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:54,283
嘿!仔细思考一下这个问题。
Hey! Think this through.

1262
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:56,827
有你这样的人才，我们可以发动一场革命。
With someone of your caliber, we can start a revolution.

1263
01:32:57,244 --> 01:32:59,204
我付你多少钱都行。
And I’ll pay you whatever.

1264
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:01,623
革命?什么革命?
Revolution? What revolution?

1265
01:33:02,374 --> 01:33:03,959
他想让朝鲜充斥枪支。
He wants to flood Korea with guns.

1266
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:06,420
为了什么?
For what?

1267
01:33:06,712 --> 01:33:09,089
我们可以清理污染这个国家的垃圾。
We can clean up trash who’re polluting this country.

1268
01:33:09,548 --> 01:33:10,799
这就是我正在做的。
That’s what I’m doing.

1269
01:33:11,508 --> 01:33:14,094
不,不是我们!
No, not us!

1270
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:16,597
我们是革命者，真正的垃圾!
We are revolutionists, the real trash!

1271
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:19,224
不熟练,休眠的罪犯!
Unskilled, dormant criminals!

1272
01:33:19,558 --> 01:33:21,977
我们可以清理那些垃圾!
We can clean up those trash!

1273
01:33:24,021 --> 01:33:25,063
详细说明。
Elaborate.

1274
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:28,442
那些为了选举权而污染韩国的人!
Those who pollute Korea for their right to vote!

1275
01:33:28,567 --> 01:33:30,569
我们必须铲除那些垃圾!
We must eradicate those trash!

1276
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:31,528
嘿!
Hey!

1277
01:33:35,115 --> 01:33:37,451
你真喜欢聊天。
You sure like to talk.

1278
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:39,244
不，不是那个…
No, it’s not that...

1279
01:33:39,578 --> 01:33:41,205
我不知道我为什么在这里…
I don’t know why I’m here...

1280
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:43,123
把他扔进马桶。
Dump him in the toilet.

1281
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:47,961
我真的很抱歉。
I’m really sorry.

1282
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:51,131
我就不能被打一顿吗?
Couldn’t I just get a beating here?

1283
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:53,842
我很乐意挨打!
I’ll gladly get a beating!

1284
01:33:53,926 --> 01:33:55,344
请不!
Please no!

1285
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:58,889
虽然不是故意的，
Although it wasn’t intentional,

1286
01:33:59,097 --> 01:34:02,434
我的老板很高兴能结案
my bosses are happy about wrapping up this case

1287
01:34:02,518 --> 01:34:04,228
与中国联合行动
as a joint op with China.

1288
01:34:04,478 --> 01:34:05,812
那就把我弄出去
Then get me out of here.

1289
01:34:06,522 --> 01:34:08,899
你给我们惹了太多麻烦了。
You stir up way too much trouble for us to do that.

1290
01:34:09,983 --> 01:34:11,568
不过有一种方法。
There is one way though.

1291
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:12,361
什么?
What?

1292
01:34:13,946 --> 01:34:15,781
成为我们的秘密特工。
Become our covert agent.

1293
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:18,283
你想让我成为NIS探员?
You want me to become an NIS agent?

1294
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:22,454
我们又收到了与中国联合行动的请求。
We received another request for a joint op with China.

1295
01:34:22,538 --> 01:34:25,666
我们相信你是最适合的人选。
We believe you are perfect for it.

1296
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:27,709
你疯了吗?再做一遍吗?
Are you nuts? Do that again?

1297
01:34:27,876 --> 01:34:29,795
不可能，我不会做的。
No way, I’m not doing it.

1298
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:33,882
你会被困在这里一段时间…
You’ll be stuck here for a while...

1299
01:34:34,716 --> 01:34:38,136
等等，我阻止了枪支泛滥我们的国家…
Wait, I stopped guns from flooding our country...

1300
01:34:38,387 --> 01:34:41,890
-这应该是情有可原…-殴打，人身伤害，谋杀
- It should be an extenuating... - Assault, bodily harm, murder,

1301
01:34:42,057 --> 01:34:45,686
假扮警官，非法闯入，妨碍司法公正，破坏…
impersonating an officer, break-in, obstruction of justice, damage to...

1302
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:47,437
这么多……
So damn much...

1303
01:34:47,688 --> 01:34:50,899
即使有可减轻罪责的情况，你至少也会被判十年。
Even with an extenuating circumstance, you’ll get 10 years minimum.

1304
01:34:52,568 --> 01:34:54,736
我宁愿在这里待十年。
I’d rather stay here for 10 years.

1305
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,488
我好多次差点就死了!
I almost died so many times!

1306
01:34:57,322 --> 01:34:58,198
我不干了。
I’m not doing it.

1307
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,075
永远,永远。
Never, ever.

1308
01:35:05,414 --> 01:35:07,249
100000美元的护圈。
$100,000 retainer.

1309
01:35:07,875 --> 01:35:10,460
行动结束后再给十万。
Another $100,000 upon completion of the op.

1310
01:35:12,045 --> 01:35:13,213
交易!
Deal!

1311
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:18,844
儿科癌症病房
Pediatric Cancer Ward

1312
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:20,679
女士吗?
Ma’am?

1313
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,099
是吗?
Yes?

1314
01:35:24,183 --> 01:35:25,976
很抱歉打扰你。
Sorry to bother you.

1315
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:27,644
我需要你的签名。
I need to get your signature.

1316
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:29,313
为了什么?
For what?

1317
01:35:29,688 --> 01:35:33,150
在我们确定手术日期之前，需要监护人签字。
Before we fix the surgery date, the guardian needs to sign off.

1318
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,819
手术日期吗?
Surgery date?

1319
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:38,488
你决定拥有它。
You decided to have it.

1320
01:35:38,572 --> 01:35:40,908
手术已经付过钱了。
Surgery was already paid for.

1321
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:48,707
我很感激你解决了这件事。
I’m so thankful that you resolved the incident.

1322
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:51,293
不，是我们欠你的。
No, we’re the one in your debt.

1323
01:35:55,172 --> 01:35:55,797
是吗?
Eh?

1324
01:35:59,218 --> 01:36:00,385
已经有一段时间了。
It’s been a while.

1325
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:01,929
你们可能已经知道了
As you may already know,

1326
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:04,473
他是这次联合行动的搭档探员。
he’s your partner agent for this joint op.

1327
01:36:04,556 --> 01:36:06,433
很高兴见到你，我是赵探员。
Good to meet you, I’m Agent Chao.

1328
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:07,601
吸引Su-han。
Woo Su-han.

1329
01:36:09,186 --> 01:36:09,978
“代理”?
“Agent”?

1330
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:12,481
事情就是这样发展的。
It worked out that way.

1331
01:36:12,606 --> 01:36:16,777
阿玛特工怎么了?我联系不上他。
What happened to Agent Ama? I can’t reach him.

1332
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,987
我们正在积极地寻找他。
We are actively searching for him.

1333
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:24,451
会和多萝西失踪案有关吗?
Could it be related to the missing Dorothy case?

1334
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:27,621
我们必须从那个角度接近它。
We must approach it from that angle.

1335
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:28,539
多萝西?
Dorothy?

1336
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:32,459
多萝西到底是谁?
Who exactly is Dorothy?

1337
01:36:34,253 --> 01:36:39,007
一个前克格勃线人的代号。
A codename for a former KGB informant.

1338
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:44,388
她要把一份朝鲜情报交给阿玛特工，
She was to hand over a North Korea intel to Agent Ama,

1339
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:46,765
但两者都是遥不可及的。
but both are unreachable.

1340
01:36:47,099 --> 01:36:50,853
她要怎么交出去?
How was she supposed to hand it over?

1341
01:36:51,144 --> 01:36:53,272
多萝西喜欢黄金,
Dorothy loves gold,

1342
01:36:53,397 --> 01:36:57,568
所以她通常会把微型SD卡嵌入金条里。
so she normally imbeds micro SD card inside a gold bar.

1343
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:02,698
金猪在哪里?
Where’s the gold pig?

1344
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:05,534
-我卖了。——什么?
- I sold it. - What?

1345
01:37:05,617 --> 01:37:06,326
能再重复一遍吗?
Pardon?

1346
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:07,828
——这是什么。——没有,先生。
- It’s nothing. - Nothing, sir.

1347
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:11,123
你们要伪装成一对潜入
You are to disguise as a couple and infiltrate

1348
01:37:11,206 --> 01:37:14,168
我们认为他们被囚禁的地方。
the place where we think they’re in captivity.

1349
01:37:14,293 --> 01:37:15,169
——几?——几?
- A couple? - A couple?

1350
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:16,920
你们俩是同步的。
You two are in sync.

1351
01:37:17,045 --> 01:37:17,629
-当然不是!-当然不是!
- Of course not! - Of course not!

1352
01:37:17,713 --> 01:37:18,839
你今天没整理衣服吗?
Didn’t you coordinate your clothes today?

1353
01:37:18,922 --> 01:37:19,798
——没门!——没门!
- No way! - No way!

1354
01:37:19,882 --> 01:37:21,258
完全同步。
Totally in sync.

1355
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:28,599
我们非得穿成这样吗?
Do we have to dress like this?

1356
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:32,769
符拉迪沃斯托克!俄罗斯太冷了!
It’s Vladivostok! Russia is so cold!

1357
01:37:32,978 --> 01:37:36,356
看看周围，没人穿得跟我们一样。
Look around, no one’s dressed like us.

1358
01:37:37,316 --> 01:37:40,360
他们只是不知道!
They just don’t know!

1359
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:42,654
他们可能在路上下车。
They might get off on route.

1360
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:45,866
噢,是的。
Oh yeah.

1361
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:49,703
警察给你发的关于找到狗的短信是什么?
What was that text you got from cops about finding the dog?

1362
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:52,873
这不是多萝西。
It wasn’t Dorothy.

1363
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:55,375
你怎么能把金猪卖了?
How could you sell the gold pig?

1364
01:37:55,459 --> 01:37:57,336
如果你没卖掉它，我们现在就结束了。
If you hadn’t sold it, we’d be done by now.

1365
01:37:57,419 --> 01:37:59,713
你知道吗?它有一张SD卡?
Did you know? That it had an SD card?

1366
01:37:59,796 --> 01:38:00,589
我是唯一一个吗?
Was I the only one?

1367
01:38:00,672 --> 01:38:02,883
那为什么不把它拿回来?!
Then why not get it back?!

1368
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,220
他们把它熔化了……
They melted it down...

1369
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:09,640
你什么都做不好……
You can’t do anything right...

1370
01:38:10,766 --> 01:38:12,434
告密者什么时候来?
When’s the informant coming?

1371
01:38:12,518 --> 01:38:14,686
会合点在游轮的船头。
The meeting point is the cruise’s bow.

1372
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:20,984
喂?你在哪里?
Hello? Where are you?

1373
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:23,195
在我身后吗?
Behind me?

1374
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:26,990
有一个海洋。
There’s an ocean.

1375
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:29,284
什么?
What?

1376
01:38:33,914 --> 01:38:35,249
你为什么穿成这样?
Why are you dressed like that?

1377
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:38,460
我们要坐这艘船?
We’re taking this boat?

1378
01:38:38,752 --> 01:38:40,128
我们得悄悄地进去。
We have to go in stealthily.

1379
01:38:40,796 --> 01:38:42,422
我知道它。
I knew it.

1380
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:49,930
我们真的能坐这艘船到那里吗?
Can we really get there on this boat?

1381
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:51,390
我们很快就会知道了。
We’ll find out soon.

1382
01:38:51,557 --> 01:38:53,475
什么?什么地狱? !
What? What the hell?!

1387
01:39:13,203 --> 01:39:17,374
你什么都不记得了?
So you don’t remember anything?

1388
01:39:21,044 --> 01:39:21,879
不。
No.

1389
01:39:21,962 --> 01:39:26,133
有弹出的图像吗?没有什么呢?
Any images that pop up? Nothing like that?

1390
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:36,810
我看到一个男人，裸体，被绑在椅子上。
I see a man, naked and tied to a chair.

1391
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:39,229
他沉迷于BDSM…
He was into BDSM...

1392
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:42,524
还有一把枪，一把刀和一根针，
And a gun, knife and a needle,

1393
01:39:42,608 --> 01:39:44,318
我一直看到这些。
I keep seeing those.

1394
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:46,987
他经常有自杀的念头。
He had constant suicidal thoughts.

1395

如果它是好的,
If it’s okay,

1396

我知道有人可能能帮你。
I know someone who may be able to help you.

1397
01:39:56,955 --> 01:39:58,624
你想见见他吗?
Would you like to meet him?

1398
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:03,837
我肯定你过得很艰难。
I’m sure it’s been tough.

1399
01:40:03,962 --> 01:40:07,216
感觉好多了。
Perception’s gotten so much better.

1400
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:09,635
所以不要做任何令人遗憾的事。
So don’t do anything regrettable.

1401
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:13,639
你是在这里。我们找到你的家人了。
Here you were. We found your family member.

1402

是吗?
Yeah?

1403
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:19,186
亲爱的!亲爱的!亲爱的!
Honey! Honey! Honey!

1404
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:22,397
我到处找你!
I looked everywhere for you!

1405
01:40:22,523 --> 01:40:24,900
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

1406
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:26,318
“亲爱的”?
“Honey”?

1407
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:29,071
因为我是他妻子。
Because I’m his wife.

1408
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:31,740
不是他的姑姑吗?
Not his aunt?

1409
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:35,369
你说这些话是在冒生命危险!
You’re risking your life with those words!

1410
01:40:36,411 --> 01:40:38,872
很明显这很奇怪。
It’s obvious this is very peculiar.

1411
01:40:38,956 --> 01:40:42,292
为什么这个帅哥要嫁给你这样的人?
Why’d this handsome man marry someone like you?

1412
01:40:43,544 --> 01:40:46,129
你对女人的吸引力了解多少?
What’d you even know about women’s attraction?

1413
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:48,382
我真的不明白。
I really don’t get it.

1414
01:40:49,216 --> 01:40:51,134
亲爱的，我们去别的地方吧。
Honey, let’s go somewhere else.

1415
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:54,555
你以前有女人的麻烦，现在也有男人的麻烦了?
You had women trouble in the past, but now men too?

1416
01:40:54,638 --> 01:40:56,265
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1417
01:40:56,348 --> 01:40:59,852
当然是我们的家，不关你的事!
Our home, of course, none of your business!

1418
01:40:59,935 --> 01:41:03,772
我们怎么能把一个可疑的女人托付给他?
How could we trust him with a suspicious woman?

1419
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:06,608
可疑吗?我们结婚了!
Suspicious? We’re married!

1420

你至少老了20岁!

我定期打肉毒杆菌!
I get Botox regularly!

1422
01:41:11,738 --> 01:41:13,949
亲爱的!你要去哪儿?!
Honey! Where are you going?!

1423
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:14,992
小心!
Careful!
