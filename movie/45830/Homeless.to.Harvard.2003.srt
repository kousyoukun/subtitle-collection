1
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,403
I wanted really good to my mother

2
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,699
She was drug addict

3
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,994
She was an alcoholic

4
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,039
She was legally blind

5
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,709
She was schizophrenic

6
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,545
But I never forgot that she loved me

7
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,047
even if she did

8
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,134
all the time

9
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,053
all the time

10
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,142
all the time

11
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,616
Give me the money!

12
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,951
it's mine!

13
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,120
it's mine, the state gave this to me!

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,081
If you do not like us do not eat!

15
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,502
Do not touch me, touch me not!

16
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,878
Where are they, eh? Where are they?

17
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,379
Where is it ?

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,011
Please, give it to me

19
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,811
-I gave it to you, -Let go MoM!

20
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,398
I gave a 100 to you

21
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,610
When the check came I gave $ 100 to you to one of you.

22
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,696
to keep them from, you understand?

23
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,407
Those for us to live on

24
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,745
every month it's the same damn thing

25
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,165
so you can put it to your arms so we can starve

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,542
it's mine

27
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,461
I didn't have it.

28
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,129
You are a liar

29
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,639
Give it to me, it's mine!

30
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,350
it's mine!

31
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,270
We are hungry!

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,856
I can't We need food MoM

33
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,692
what do you ever do for me, hah ? I gave you life

34
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,779
Do you want me to go on the streets as prostituitmi hah?

35
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,241
do you want me to do that ? I know I do that sometimes, right?

36
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,844
I need it

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,849
I need it

38
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,854
I need it

39
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,442
what is Medina?

40
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:59,031
what is Medina, that gives you $ 15,200 at the end of the round of double jeopardy.

41
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,840
I wanted that smile,

42
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,052
Oh God, I wantedthat smile so much

43
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,223
I was pathetic, wasn't I?

44
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,855
don't take the Acquedotto

45
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,732
Mom!

46
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,028
Dady ...

47
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,453
-she's taking the Acquedotto. -What the hell difference does she make?

48
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,081
- she'll get mugged !! - Who cares!

49
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,378
Help her father, she can't see, she'll get mugged

50
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,089
always a big production

51
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,557
see, They said they'll fix the light for change

52
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,392
The muggers will break them again

53
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,393
No,No

54
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,063
No, you see she's okay the water runs down hill

55
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,983
There is no water

56
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,610
You are wrong, dont you know what the aqueduct is?

57
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:23,699
The aqueduct carried water to New York City Well, for over 100 years it did that

58
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,826
Then they closed it down but now

59
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,705
the ghost water,right? it carries your mother along.

60
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,336
My father, you could sitdown on a couch and talk to my father

61
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,547
He just couldn't talk to him for long

62
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,924
Hey Jane!

63
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,805
He knew so much, he got all the answers righ on jeopardy.

64
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,850
He's a genius, he've the answer every time!

65
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,733
Watch where you going

66
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,656
That's the thing

67
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,451
Your parents all you gots

68
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:11,705
I looked at them as example of what should I find every where in the world

69
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,709
and they paid so litle attention to my needs

70
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,963
but then it felt their needs was so powerful

71
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:24,051
it didn't make me feel gurt or angry but they didn't look into me

72
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,683
because I felt okay this, This must be the human condition to be so

73
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,278
And then the world came in

74
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,038
you took my husband Elisabeth I'll kill you!

75
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,039
No, Mom!

76
00:06:55,707 --> 00:07:00,003
I'm not your mother I did you a favor

77
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,881
Help me cleanup Liz, if they see this they're gonna take us too!

78
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,761
No, noo! get out of my house!

79
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,762
you're not taking me

80
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,808
I do not come with you, you understand? Noo, noo!

81
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,101
what happen to the window?

82
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,270
she threw the cat out

83
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,359
leave me alone

84
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,405
Why don't you take the medication and be a good girl?

85
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,739
She takes it

86
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,867
she just take too many other things

87
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,291
- This place is a mess - what happened here

88
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,876
He took a knife!

89
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,085
I fell down

90
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,295
- she got a knife - put the knife down

91
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,683
Alright,Where's the phone? we don't have one

92
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,310
- This woman is unfit - you're kidding

93
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,439
look you girls have a choice clean this place up help your mother!

94
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,440
Tell our father!

95
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,734
Ignore her she's a feminist.

96
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,903
I can take you anytime I want

97
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:09,907

98
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,536
hey, hey, Where you going? comeback here ,come back!

99
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,039

100
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,292
They've girls in there they'll beat you down take everything you got

101
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,878
you can't have anything

102
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,964
You'll have to clean bathrooms you'll work there if you don't work here

103
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,390
back off! back off! it's not a show

104
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,478
got nothing better to do, hah?

105
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,815
Mom!

106
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,610
mom

107
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,532
mom

108
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,700
Couldn't they see?

109
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,495
anyone could see she was in so much pain

110
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,624
The strugle was so much on the surface so there if anyone cared to look

111
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,294
it wasn't like she was running of a good mother to somebody else or not that was a good mother

112
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,798
she just didn't have anymore to give

113
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,676
Let me go !

114
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,877
Alright, hey hey hey!

115
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,421
oh! something stinks!

116
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,590
what is that?

117
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,511
I was always the smelly kid in class

118
00:09:54,511 --> 00:10:01,310
Lisa stood on the bucket shower but daddy left her doing she had to marry a doctor she had so many expectations

119
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,771
I didn't have any expectations, so therefore I guess I stunk

120
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,863
I scratched for lice, and burn between my legs

121
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,408
My teachers was always telling me not to fidge it

122
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,577
but my underwear...

123
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,996
I didn't know what to do about underwear

124
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,498
I just worried that it fell apart

125
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,544
Alright, people thank you resess is over

126
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,009
My teeth ached

127
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,010
I was hungry ...

128
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,097
The teachers words never seem to reach me

129
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:44,937
Words just seems .. fall on the floor

130
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,689
Give me the test,Liz. there's no point of taking that No, I'll take it.

131
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,858
But you been here what? three times this month?

132
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,569
I'll take it it doesn't look that hard

133
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:54,738
fine

134
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,668
oh Liz, stay here

135
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,841
you do smell, you know? doesn't your mother tell you...

136
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,887
No, no ... it is my fault I just forget

137
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,725
ok Well,when you wanna have shower tonigh will you wash back here?

138
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,604
I've been saving something for you

139
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,654
Here ...

140
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,285
And here, bhow did you do that?

141
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,037
you've never in school

142
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:47,291
I read a lot

143
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,167
yeah, what do you read?

144
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,794
The Encyclopedia

145
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:56,008
The lady of the upstairs, Eva, she found one in the dumpster

146
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:59,511
the whole set, well except from R to S

147
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:04,474
If you've asked me between R and S I would've done it wrong I was just lucky

148
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:08,604
Oh Liz, you have to come to school OK No, I mean it, look

149
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,772
it's redeculus you're way too smart not to be here

150
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,775
I do not understand why toy don't come. I will.

151
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,780
How can I tell her that school make me sad?

152
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,493
I had never talked to her, I don't know how to talk to anyone.

153
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,665
My house was not a place that you can come out of it and be normal. - you'll have to come everyday

154
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,627
It's not a threat, it's promise

155
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,421
and is not a threat, is a promise.

156
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:51,897
- Eva, look what I got, - a 100 - thanks to your encyclopedia!

157
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,943
Good, you gotta get a good marks! you don't wanna be an idiot

158
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:00,405
and you keep it up now, you hear me? now your mother's back

159
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,575
My mother is back?

160
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:08,163
Well, we had nice quite couple a months, did we?

161
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:14,378
The only good thing about taking my mother to the nutt house was that when she came back she was my Mom again

162
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:21,718
she cooked and she cleaned shorthand for the company in a for me, that was the good quite couple of months

163
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,347
Before the drugs came back in

164
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,690
Mom ..

165
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,205
momy

166
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,707

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,300
Are you OK? I'm okay

168
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,513

171
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,233
Well, that hospital

172
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,944
wasn't too bad

173
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:27,784
it's too green the walls and there were bars on the windows

174
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:31,997
I'm sorry, you had to see that, you know

175
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,711
and I'm glad you're home

176
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:49,640
Look, Look I got a 100

177
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,606
Ma. no .. 100 is a good good, 100 is the perfect

178
00:14:57,815 --> 00:14:59,900
didn't you ever get hundred?

179
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,986
No !

180
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,157
hey, I go to school

181
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:13,288
I ran away too young. Do not ever run away from home

182
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,040
I won't

183
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,800
I ... I will always be here for you

184
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,053
I know, Mom

185
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,640
I will always be there ... always

186
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,352
I know, Mom

187
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,482
I am sick ...

188
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:46,405
I'm sick ... I'm sick, I...

189
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,200
I have AIDS ...

190
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,662
No. .. no ...

191
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,790
No, no no ... baby, don't

192
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:05,465
They say don't be afraid the say I migh.. I could live forever, okay?

193
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,676
but I can't live here

194
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,807
- I gonna go home - This is home

195
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,186
No, home to my pops, I will take you and Lisa

196
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,479
No, no, you have to stay here

197
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:25,277
I gotta stop the drugs, and I can't do it when daddy around

198
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,405
But you'll be alone

199
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:35,245
Liz, Lisa is already gone over, just packup your things and let's go

200
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:39,791
No no, cause you said pops will beat you you said he raped your sister

201
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,792
this is the way it has to be now

202
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,046
No, stay here

203
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,507
I can't

204
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,967
stay mom!

205
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,053
Everything was falling apart

206
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:54,765
I thought If I stayed I could have stop it

207
00:16:54,765 --> 00:17:00,521
I thought If I stayed everything some how could stay the same

208
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,290
just open the door, it's no use

209
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,837
I know you're in there

210
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,850
where is your mother and sister?

211
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,018
they're gone

212
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,353
where's your father?

213
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:44,189
he's gonna get some food help, he'll be right back.

214
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,362
your teacher called, you still not going to school

215
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:55,200
you never in school We gota do something about this

216
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,538
Miss Wanda warned you, I warned you, everyone in case workers warned you

217
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:00,539
this is been goining on for years

218
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:06,003
we said clean up this place and go to school, clean up and go to school,

219
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,923
and you haven't done either one of them had you ... Elizabeth, have you?

220
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,466
No

221
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,135
so, what are we gonna do?

222
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,053
I do not know

223
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,638
I do

224
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,309
you're going into the system I'm taking her

225
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:25,188
No! But things are better now, my dady buys me big potatoes everyday

226
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,816
you're not paying the rent, you're not getting her to school

227
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,860
I tell him to go, I told you to go to school

228
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,863
she's got a mind of her own, she's a feminist

229
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:38,035
this is not a joking matter, pack her a suitcase ... now!

230
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:44,374
No, no! I'll go to school, please!

231
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:47,753
This isn't working, we need an adult who is responsible

232
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,631
My grandfather is responsible! My grandfather will take me! My sister is there

233
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:55,385
- your sister goes to school. - I'll go to school! I'll go to school, please!

234
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,304
Not make noise

235
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:03,101
I'll talk to him and if he will take you you will be out in 24 hours

236
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,103
I'm sorry

237
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,441
and if he won't?

238
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,115
You will have time to figure out how to live life

239
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,275
figure out my life ...

240
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,569
do people really do that?

241
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,572
If they do that , they're falling down in a deep dark hole

242
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,545
buzzed in, locked in

243
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,506
it was like to visiting my mother

244
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,468
Only I was in the crazy house now

245
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,313
Get her!

246
00:20:55,631 --> 00:21:01,678
I didn't get out in 24 hours, I didn't get out in 24 days, no one wanted me.

247
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:05,349
they just left me there

248
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,027
Why don't you go to school?

249
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:22,032
That's the big problem I got Here, why dont you go?

250
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:37,256
Forom what I can see you have got a discipline problem

251
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:59,004
Liz! Hey pops!

252
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:04,134
You call your mother Jean! Come out here, she's here

253
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,017
I'm late for school but I wanted to see you first

254
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,227
Thanks Lisa

255
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,813
don't screw this up we are doing okay

256
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:22,152
and don't expect too much, she is dying

257
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,827
Lizzy!

258
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:31,203
Mom

259
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:35,290
oh God

260
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,680
When I think of my life, this is the time I like to think of

261
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,558
when I got back and my mother's mind was clear

262
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,770
there was no cokain so her schizophrenia medicine kept on working

263
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,815
and we go to the cafe, and sit and talk

264
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:03,819
eat hamburghers, we were together

265
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,781
even with her bad eyes I think she could see me

266
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,409
well, she can see my outline

267
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,953
and for a while I had my mother again

268
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:16,415
even the park, yea I remember, we used to slide down the hill

269
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:19,459
remeber we put down that cart board and we pretend that we sled

270
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,129
- you remember that? - Yes

271
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:26,967
- how about the tickle monster ? - we screamed and laughed about that one

272
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,971
Yeah, I was a good mother, wasn't I?

273
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,687
yea, you were fine

274
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:40,230
yeah

275
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,029
well, I'm really glad we are all together you and me, and Lisa

276
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,991
what if dad went off drugs too would that be great?

277
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,203
Maybe we can go back to University Avenue

278
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,837
well,your dad is in a shelter for homeless

279
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,465
I'm afraid he lost the apartment

280
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,802
he kind of ignore the rent, so, you know ...

281
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:14,056
What about my stuff?

282
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,557
got thrown out

283
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:18,977
all of it? Even my encyclopedias?

284
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:23,065
I'm really sorry , they board up the whole place

285
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:28,487
there was nothing we could do, it just, crap happens I mean ...

286
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:33,408
Look, I gotta go around the corner and see few friends

287
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,995
just for a minute okay? You finsh your burger

288
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,290
and I ... I'll be right back just be a minute

289
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,918
just be a minute

290
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:47,065
so that was that, no going back

291
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:51,069
I hadn't kept anything together, I only made thaings worse

292
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,363
If I had only go to school ...

293
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:57,493
if I had only, if I had only ...

294
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:00,078
so that part of my life was over

295
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:05,083
I guess the new part have begun

296
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,757

297
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:16,637

I wasn't the smelly kid anymore, I had learned to shower every day at the group home

307
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:07,020
and my clothes, even if they came from the shop, all fit

308
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,773
but still didn't know how to be in school

309
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,234
I just don't know how to be normal

310

Elisabeth is a fine name, is the name of a queen, the Elizabethan was the age of Shakespeare

322
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,158
What's you problem with it?

323
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,247
My mother calls me Elisabeth when she's going insane ...

324
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,671

358
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:17,831
she couldn't take living straight, why should I expect her to take dying

359
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,751
isn't dying the hardest thing onyone have ever done?

360
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,044
Everyone is gone

361
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,340
- except you ... - yeah

362
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,594
So where does you grandfather sleep?

363
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:34,139
Here? safe to his daughter?

364
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,141
But I don't think like that

365
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,894
Yeah, but don't know

366
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:43,899
he Did some things to her when I was younger, she told me that

367
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,028
With her sister and not her?

368
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,533
I figure he did them both ...

369
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,826
so your sister is crazy too?

370
00:33:56,536 --> 00:34:03,877
Yeah, and their mother too, that's why I didn't wanna come here

371
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:09,049
you know, My...Mom is getting back to my dad

372
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:14,763
I wish My mom would

373
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,935
He does staff to my sister

374
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,648
You do not have a sister

375
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,359
Lucky for her

376
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,572
did you tell your mother? Yes, I told her

377
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:34,741
but she left him, and cursed him

378
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:38,537
she said she's gonna call the cops, and now she's getting back with him

379
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:42,124
you know, I asked her how she could do that, and she said that she missed him

380
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,044
she missed him ...

381
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,966
I was 7 years whe he first stuck it in

382
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,968
Chris, Chris, don't!

383
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,556
move in with me

384
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,350
- What, stay here? - Yeah!

385
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:04,605
What .. what will your grandfather say?

386
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:08,192
He won't know We will work it out so will never see him

387
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:12,070
he won't get up until after this for work he's like a robot anyway, he's out by eight

388
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,115
I'm back at 6 out!

389
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,950
Pops! she had no place to stay!

390
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,410
This not my problem

391
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,411
Leave her alone!

392
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:29,046
Your mother is dying your peace of trash father walked out and stuck me with all of this

393
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,924
did I ask this in my old age? tell me!

394
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,603
What are you doing?

395
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:52,319
fine, that suits me, you'll end up trash anyway

396
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:56,531
just like your parents

397
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,921
So I left

398
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:20,472
you wanna go get your staff ? or you'll leave me here alone

399
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:26,687
do anyone of us bargain for our life

400
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,481
it seems to me that we're just gonna fall into them

401
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:32,192
and then we have to do the bets we can Let's go!!

402
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,947
My mother was dying, my father was gone

403
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:41,869
but I had to believe that I the road would rise up to meet me

404
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:46,582
I was 15 years, when I wen out of door

405
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:59,678
What is a home anyway, a roof, bed

406
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:05,350
A place when where you go there they have to take you

407
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:10,397
If so, I was 15 years when I became homeless

408
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,649
You get some change? Get a job

409
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,573
how are you doing tonight?

410
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,661
Good bless you kid

411
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,752
spend some changes

412
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,683
Sometimes I felt I had neverhad a home in my life

413
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,953
Bring it on

414
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,230
Let's go

415
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:55,794
what are you doing! come back here

416
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:07,264
At other times I knew where ever my mother was that's where my home was

417
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,219
oh god!!

418
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:52,684
but month by month she was fading away

419
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,188
Liz ...

420
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:00,234
yeah!

421
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,823
where did you go?

422
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:08,700
I've been staying with friends

423
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,958
I miss you

424
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:25,008
paps! he hit me and you know

425
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:28,804
I couldn't stay here

426
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:30,389
Alright

427
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:37,938
Look! your sister told me that you stopped going to school

428
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,440
I'm gonna go back

429
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,484
when?

430
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:48,031
when you get better

431
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,998
They tease me

432
00:40:55,998 --> 00:41:02,504
they tease me at the bar cause I shake

433
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:06,049
I can't stop shaking

434
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:12,347
I think it is becuase of the drinking

435
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,558
you should propably stop

436
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:19,479
Ok, ok ..

437
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:29,573
you're gonna get better

438
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,673
I love you, mom

439
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,052
mom

440
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,805
I love you

441
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:20,332
get over there

442
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,468
sorry!

443
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:46,108
- Look out!! - Stop

444
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:57,536
hey guys, wait up I'll catch you later I'm just gonna ...

445
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,329
Bye

446
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:02,374
mom

447
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,883
We took up a collection

448
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:17,014
she isn't coming here anymore becuase she always think you're laughing at

449
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:23,270
she's dead honey she died yesterday morning

450
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:27,501
Sometimes I feel that there is a skin on the world

451
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:31,797
and those of us who were born under it can see through it

452
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,259
we just can't get through it

453
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:49,982
My mother was being buried in section 51 the charity plot

454
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,489
My mother was in there, strangers had put her in there

455
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:03,954
was she naked, was she frightent no, she was gone

456
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:07,249
come on, let's go No, wait a minute

457
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:11,795
there should be a service, there should be a priest, what supposed to happen?

458
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:14,465
When you go, we're gonna burry you, that's all

459
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:15,966
it's a she

460
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,136
it is my mother

461
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:23,348
- There is no priest? - Not in these cases, you did know that?

462
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:27,060
she is dead, put her in the ground

463
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:38,822
Priest or no priest, what does it matter, she was gone, she was already rutting

464
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:40,699
sorry

465
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:45,370
as I suppose to believe she had found a turnal Peace

466
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,713
you Coming with us?

467
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,760
will you just go?

468
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:05,224
Hey, wait

469
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,127
Ok ..

470
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:24,094
let us get out of here, okay?

471
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:35,439
Liz, you know ... I just .. I can't I can't do this anymore. you know.. so, I'm going

472
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,358
Where?

473
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,278
group home

474
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,155
A crazy house

475
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:48,702
You know Liz, it's this, this ??? this is crazy

476
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:54,500
you should Come with me

477
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,593
yeah, so see you around

478
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:19,358
People died, things decayed

479
00:48:20,901 --> 00:48:24,238
everything that seems so solid is meaning less

480
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,618
all that we left is the gestures we make

481
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:34,706
gestures in air, that's what we remember

482
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,668
I remember riding with my mother through the leaves

483
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:45,509
the year ending put her arms around me, when I was little, and she was well

484
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:47,886
that was long ago,

485
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:50,264
maybe it only happened once

486
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:56,395
mybe she betrayed me a thousand times it didn't matter Math will always be as a subject

487
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:58,522
we remember what we choose

488
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,525
get out of there!

489
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:15,873
Where you gonna put the stone?

490
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,209
there's no stones here , there's no room

491
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:27,634
In a week there would be no trace over

492
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:35,476
but what did it matter, this wasn't the real world, and we really live in each others hearts

493
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:30,823
She lived in my heart, but I live nowhere, I was all alone in the world

494
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,455
You are 16 years old with an 8th grade education

495
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:43,168
and when you are down the world spiral that will end in the worst place than you ever dreamed

496
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:47,923
you've burned every bridge, you're ran out of every welcome

497
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,844
an everyone who has ever believe in you you have let down

498
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,308
Eva?

499
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:11,071
I don't want to be an idiot, I want to go to school

500
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:55,616
- Yes - Hi, I am ELisabeth Murray, I have an appointment

501
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:59,745
at 9:30, it's 10:30

502
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:03,832
I'm Sorry, the subway got stucked I'm sorry too ,but it's really late

503
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:13,050
The school started 3 weeks ago we are just about full kids get on time here honey

504
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:21,517
I read the brochure intensive Student participation for the Development of injust community calendar

505
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:26,730
I just need one chance

506
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:34,571
You can wait and talk to David, but he got this meeting right after

507
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:57,886
I knew at that moment I had to make a choice

508
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:02,349
I could submit to everything that was happening and live a life of execuses

509
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:09,565
or I could push myself, I can push myself and make my life good

510
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:33,630
- We'll get to you back on Friday. - Ok, thank you it's a pleasure guys

511
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,509
- Elisabeth - Liz

512
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:40,053
Liz I am sorry, we are making our last decision and I'm already late

513
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,764
can I just talk to you for a minute ? 30 seconds?

514
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:46,477
well, there's the application, and the whole big eassy question

515
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:50,606
I've already done the eassy I really want this

516
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:04,995
I haven't had a lot of gown ups that proved to be trust worthy or in it for the long run .. so...

517
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:08,832
Maybe I don't know how to talk to you

518
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:17,090
My parents both use drugs, alot of them, I won't go near them, but ... I guess I've kind of lived that life style

519
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:21,345
I'm embareced now, not how late back I've been I mean...

520
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:24,431
I've really never been in school except for the 8th grade, but...

521
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:26,558
but your grades are very good to enter school

522
00:54:26,558 --> 00:54:31,021
I used to show up last week and take the test, and that's how I got promoted

523
00:54:32,147 --> 00:54:37,110
I'm smart, I know I can succeed, I just need a chance

524
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:43,450
I need the chance I need the chance to climb out of the place I've born in, I mean...

525
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:49,248
Everyone I know they just, angry, tired they are trying to survive

526
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:56,672
But I know that there is a world out there that's .. better!! that's...

527
00:54:56,672 --> 00:55:02,427
better developed and... I wanna live in it

528
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:03,428
Why now?

529
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:12,187
My mother died of AIDS, she died couple of months ago and ...

530
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:16,859
it was real .. slap in the face

531
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:23,782
I guess I always thought that she was gonna get better and take care of me ..

532
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:28,162
it's prety stupid, huh?

533
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:32,750
You had never take care of me, I took care of her ..

534
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:36,253
she was my baby

535
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,843
but now she's gone .. so ..

536
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,221
now it's time to take care of yourslef

537
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,351

538
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:55,355

539
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:56,356

551

552
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,017
Why, this is not a normal school?

553
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:17,354

574
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:36,558
I knew you excpected that already

575
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:41,438
her mother was actually beautiful, like a movie star but.. aher mother was also kind of feminist

576
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,439
or something like that

577
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,738
Anyway I thought when I met her she was just, you know ... spirited bu actually she was completly insane

01:03:38,652 --> 01:03:40,279
and what do we have here?

635
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:43,991

and I want you to have them?

637
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:54,585

How do I make an A Liz, an A minus is an excellent mark

651
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:27,052
This is your first working school in ..what .. forever?

652
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:32,808
If my words count I want them to be right

653
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:39,606
Okay well ...

654
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:05,215

666
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:43,814
I've been back 4 times and I would be at school just a little early

667
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:46,149
Then David would let me in

668
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:50,446
For the first time my life had some order I can count on

- you okay, Liz? - Yes

692
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:27,811
I've just was always been trash, you know..

693
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:31,523
You are not trash

694
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:35,360
This is to get you thinking about college

695
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,323
- what's college like - it's all crap, shut up!

696
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:42,576
You can come too Can't she?

697
01:10:42,576 --> 01:10:45,788

698
01:10:45,788 --> 01:10:49,500
come on chris dream a little, what do you wanna be when you grow up?

699
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,210
boy, I was grown since I was 7

700
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:55,297
- Chris ... - I mean after high school, it's okay

701
01:10:55,297 --> 01:11:00,302
No, it's not okay I'll be a garbage man, I'll be a prostitute

702
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:08,310
who cares what the hell I'm gonna be?

703
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:18,487
Welcome to Harvard guys

704
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:47,933
So, does it looks like you though it would?

705
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:52,562
Better, definitely better

706
01:11:52,562 --> 01:11:56,817
Liz, they're just people

707
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:58,944
Not people like me

708
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:05,743
Why not people like me? What made them so different?

709
01:12:05,743 --> 01:12:07,244
becuase of the way they were born?

710
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:15,210
I was working as hard as I could so so I didn't end up as food stamps or hustling

711
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:21,884
What if .. what if I worked even more?

712
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:28,223
I was so close to this skin that I can touch it

713
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:41,361
It would be a reach, it's not impossible

714
01:12:49,078 --> 01:12:54,166
- dona, there any other scholarships? - yea,it's quite a few

715
01:12:54,166 --> 01:13:01,381
Write 1500 words about the importance of the free market in the free world and win $ 500

716
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:06,011
yea, I would need only 70 of those, every year

717
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:11,183
Ah, there was something brand new from the newyork time, maybe I didn't put them in yet

718
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:24,488
- $ 12,000 every year for 4 years! - What do you have to do?

719
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:30,536
Attach a brief eassy describing what you believe to be the most significant academic achievement

720
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:36,041
and how you have overcome any challenges tor obstacles

721
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:39,127
can I have copy of this?

722
01:13:39,127 --> 01:13:44,299
I want to stand beside the people in the sidewalk not be so far beneath them

723
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:53,475
I wanna go to Harvard, and become very developed read all the bets books

724
01:13:53,475 --> 01:13:57,104
Then I find myself thinking: if I just go crazy?

725
01:13:57,104 --> 01:14:01,775
even lose every *** of my potential to do that

726
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:07,990
I have to do it, I have no choice

727
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:15,247
- Am I late? - No, I'm early

728
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:21,044
- I made you some coffee one sweet ***, right? - Right!

729
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:29,386
Thank you

730
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:32,681
Can I have a stamp for this?

731
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:35,976
that's the New York Times schoolarship! you haven't mailed it yet?

732
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:39,271
- When is the dead line? - Tomorrow

733
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:42,899
I gave you that 4 months ago, Liz! What were you waiting for?

734
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:46,778
for today, for me to turn 18

735
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:47,779
it's your birthday?

736
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,868
Happy birthday!

737
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:55,412
but I don't think that an age required

738
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:59,583
No, Thank you

739
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:05,881
but now I can tell the truth, that I was a homeless and no one could come and take me away

740
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:25,776
Lisa

741
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:29,655
Liz!

742
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:30,656
Yes

743
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:34,201
What are you doing here?

744
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:40,916
I have this interview I am a finalist for a big New York times scholarship

745
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:45,712
But, I don't have anything to wear

746
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:47,089
you want my cloth?

747
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:53,011
Well, nothing fancy it's just .. something I can put over this

748
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:05,899
Thank you

749
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:12,364
Mom sold my coat once I couldn't go to school

750
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,451
I remember

751
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:19,705
I cried, I love going to school so much

752
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:24,459
you never went to school

753
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:27,963
how did they gave you the scholarship?

754
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:33,510
because I'm homeless and I'm doing really well in school now

755
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:37,973
You are not a homeless, Liz, you could stay here

756
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:44,771
No I couldn't, you know that ...

757
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,898
Grandpap hates you !!

758
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:55,032
I'm going blind

759
01:16:56,992 --> 01:16:59,286
like Mom

760
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,333
I'm scared

761
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:33,153
Liz!

762
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:37,116
Liz, they kicked me out of the group home with all my stuff

763
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:38,742
They can't kick you out you are not 18 years

764
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:43,330
then group with me in Brooklin, I don't wan to go to Brooklin! You have to help me!

765
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:44,540
I have an interview

766
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,875
- No! Liz! - I have to!

767
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,919
- You can not leave - I have to

768
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:51,421
Chris!

769
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:55,259
just let me go through this one thing, and then you can go back and go to school with me

770
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:58,595
I don't want to go to school! I don't belong there, and either do you

771
01:17:58,595 --> 01:18:01,181
Yes, I do

772
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:04,268
you think they like people like us into harvard

773
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:52,024
The world moves, you just a spec., it can all happen without you

774
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:55,986
situations are not conducive to what you want for yourself

775
01:18:55,986 --> 01:19:01,366
someone else's needs someone else's plat is going to be stronger than yours is

776
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:05,579
I think people just get frustrated with how harsh life can be

777
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:11,293
So they spend their time ** on that frustrations and calling it anger

778
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:16,006
keeping their eyes shut from the wholes situation

779
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:21,804
to all the little tiny things that have come together to make it what it is?

780
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:28,602
because I was turn so inward by my Mom and Dad, I got a chance to see how

781
01:19:28,602 --> 01:19:34,775
all the litle tiny things come together to make the final product

782
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:41,323
so, I was never ** to wonder why this or why that

783
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,909
I knew why

784
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:48,831
not that I was happy about it, in fact I was really sad about it most of the time

785
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:50,541
but I was very accepting

786
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:55,295
I was very accepting

787
01:19:55,295 --> 01:20:01,051
I just always knew that I needed to get out

788
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:04,930
Is there anything else you would like to tell us?

789
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,143
I loved my mother,

790
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:11,228
so much .. I mean

791
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:16,066
She was a drug addict, was an alcholic

792
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:20,070
she was legally blind she was schizophrenic

793
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,282
But ..

794
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:28,328
I never forget that .. she did love me

795
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:34,418
even if she did,

796
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,211
All the time,

797
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:40,465
All the time,

798
01:20:42,134 --> 01:20:44,845
All the time ...

799
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:56,356
I hope you all know how much I really need this

800
01:20:56,356 --> 01:21:01,612
how I can't go to college or anything without it

801
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:52,788
she earned a 95 average and finished at the top of her class of 150

802
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:55,791
she did alot completly 4 years high school in 2

803
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,377
she did it while homeless

804
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:02,005
her mother is dead her father is a drug addict and living in shelters

805
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:04,633
and anyway I can describe this can't do justice to her accomplishments

806
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:09,096
So, I'll just introduce to you our sixths New York time schoolarship winner

807
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,723
Liz Murray

808
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:22,651
everything is changed,

809
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:25,654
my life will never be the same

810
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:32,077
and I don't know what else to say except for thank you thank you very much

811
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:36,498
Liz! Liz, how did you do this?

812
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:41,378
How could I not do it .. my parents showed me what the alternative was

813
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:43,380
Didn't you even feel sorry for yourself

814
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:44,631
Sorry?

815
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:48,719
Sleeping in the subway, eating out of dumpsters

816
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,556
that had always been my life

817
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:58,979
I really .. I feel that I get lucky because any sensive security

818
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:02,733
awas pulled out from under so I was forced to look forward

819
01:23:02,733 --> 01:23:06,403
I had to , there was no going back

820
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:09,323
And I reached the point I just thought: Alrigth,

821
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:15,704
I'm gonna work as hard as I possibly can and see what happens

822
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:18,666
And .. now I'm going to college

823
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:22,753
and the New York Times is going to pay

824
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:33,430
So you were lucky ... but is there anything you change if you were able?

825
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:35,599
Yes

826
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:40,896
I'd give it back

827
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,397
All of it

828
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:48,195
If I could have my family back

829
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:55,577
I got into harvard,

830
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,454
I got a job at the New York Times,

831
01:23:57,663 --> 01:24:00,249
I got an apartment

832
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:03,293
I don't have to carry my whole life with me any more

833
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:07,089
I don't have to carry my whole life with me

834
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:09,716
but I do ...

835
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:14,930
Every one I have known, Everything I have done

836
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:19,643
pieces chip off, I forget the little things

837
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:25,732
I had still hard to carry

838
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:28,569
alone

839
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,531
so that's why I told you so,

840
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:34,700
That's why I've told you my story

841
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:40,539
Now I can lay that burden down, put it dressed AND...

842
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:45,085
and I can go on

843
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:50,883
