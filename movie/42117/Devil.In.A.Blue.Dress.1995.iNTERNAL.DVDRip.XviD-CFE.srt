1
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:20,404
It was summer 1948.

2
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,086
And I needed money.

3
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:26,891
After going door-to-door all day,
I was back again at Joppy's bar...

4
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:30,494
... trying to figure out where
to look for work the next day.

5
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:34,378
The newspapers was going on and on
about the city elections...

6
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,341
... Iike they was really
gonna change somebody's life.

7
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:41,946
My life had already changed
when I lost my job 3 weeks before.

8
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:46,871
For example, one of the white guys
pulls a double shift.

9
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:50,915
If he says he's too tired to work
overtime, you don't fire them.

10
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:53,117
That's all you have to say?

11
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:04,969
No, that's not all.
I need....

12
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:11,055
I need to pay my mortgage and eat.

13
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:16,220
I need a house to live in and
clothes on my back. I need the job.

14
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,624
I'm sorry, fella,
I gotta get back to work.

15
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:25,269
My name's not "fella."

16
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:31,516
My name's not "fella."
My name is Ezekiel Rawlins.

17
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:34,198
Catch you later, Joppy.

18
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:37,481
Watch the marble, damn it!
What'd I tell you?

19
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:46,170
How much you think they're paying
at Douglas Aircraft?

20
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,652
I don't know.

21
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,321
Come on over here.

22
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:19,884
There's somebody I want you to meet.

23
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:26,330
Come on, this is a friend of mine.

24
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,334
Easy, this is Mr. Albright.

25
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:33,097
-Call me DeWitt, Easy.
-How you doing?

26
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:34,378
Take a seat.

27
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,384
Mr. Albright and me...

28
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,107
...go way back to before the war.

29
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:46,150
Back when I was still
in the fight game.

30
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,432
Ever seen this guy fight?

31
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:54,759
Every time Joppy stepped in the ring,
you knew you would see...

32
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:57,642
...some knockdown-dragout fisticuffs.

33
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:00,645
-Where you from?
-Houston.

34
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,368
Joppy's hometown.

35
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:09,694
Need a job?

36
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,416
Yeah. Easy always
trying to do better.

37
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:17,662
Easy's one of a few coloured men
around here who owns his own house.

38
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:21,305
He paying the mortgage every month,
just like y'all folks.

39
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,387
Property owner, huh?

40
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:26,310
These big companies don't give a damn.

41
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,392
I got out of that racket long ago.

42
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:32,957
If you need a job,
drop by this address, 7:00.

43
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,519
Tonight.

44
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,601
What kind of work you do?

45
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:40,725
I do favours.

46
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:43,087
I do favours for friends.

47
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:45,289
Drop by.

48
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,576
Who was that?

49
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:54,018
Just somebody I know.
Businessman.

50
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,581
-Businessman, huh?
-Yeah, he is.

51
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:00,224
Ain't nothing to worry about.

52
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,868
When I'm told there's
nothing to worry about...

53
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:06,591
...l look to see if my fly is open.

54
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:11,836
All the way home, all I thought about
was a chance to make some money.

55
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:17,682
I first came out to Los Angeles when
I got home from the war in Europe...

56
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:21,045
... with $300 in my pocket
and the G.I. Bill.

57
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:25,409
A lot of coloured folk from Texas
and Louisiana moved to California...

58
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,413
... to get them goodjobs in
the shipyards and aircraft companies.

59
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:34,579
Now, me, myself, I was a machinist.

60
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,183
And the first thing I did when I saved
enough money was to buy me a house.

61
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:43,868
Man, I loved coming home to my house.

62
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:45,029
I don't know.

63
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,992
I guess maybe I just
loved owning something.

64
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,926
-I'll knock down the trees in the back.
-Leave my trees alone.

65
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,368
Leave my trees! Get on!

66
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,874
I was feeling pretty
desperate that evening.

67
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,838
In a week, I'd be 2 months
behind on my mortgage.

68
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,200
And I wasn't about to lose my house.

69
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,724
But a chill running up the back
of my neck was telling me...

70
00:08:39,964 --> 00:08:42,126
...l was about
to make a bad decision.

71
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:45,009
Yeah, Albright made me nervous.

72
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,972
He reminded me of a fella
in Texas named Mouse.

73
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:51,495
-Let's dump this thing.
-Isn't this your friend's car?

74
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:53,538
-What'd you do?
-Just drive.

75
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,099
What did you do?

76
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,970
So, want the job?

77
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:27,972
It depends.

78
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,975
I don't wanna get mixed up in nothing.

79
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:34,819
Walk out the door in the morning...

80
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,622
...you're mixed up in something.

81
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:41,666
Only thing is, if you're mixed up
to the top or not.

82
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:44,909
I'm just looking for somebody.
For a friend.

83
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,311
Daphne Monet.

84
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:52,276
Fiancée of Todd Carter.
She's been gone two weeks.

85
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:55,560
It upset the man so much,
he stopped running for mayor.

86
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:59,163
-I've never seen her.
-That's a shame.

87
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:04,769
Daphne has a predilection
for the company of Negroes.

88
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,052
She likes jazz, pig's feet
and dark meat.

89
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,056
" Predilection."

90
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,502
I'd go looking for her myself...

91
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:21,185
...but I'm not of the right persuasion.

92
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:23,908
What do you want from me?

93
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:26,190
What do you mean?

94
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,993
-What do I do?
-Get her location.

95
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,518
Mr. Carter wants to make up with her.

96
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:35,760
$1 00.

97
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,242
I pay in advance.

98
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:45,810
$1 00.

99
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,333
To tell you where she's at?

100
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:51,576
-That's right.
-And that's all?

101
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:52,817
That's all.

102
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:57,341
Joppy tells me you used to
frequent an illegal club.

103
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:58,462
John's.

104
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:01,265
Somebody saw Daphne there
a few nights ago.

105
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,588
Start tonight.

106
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,686
Whoa, that's enough.
Thank you.

107
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,609
-I'm gonna see you later.
-All right, yeah.

108
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,777
I told you it's a grocery store.

109
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:15,740
How you doing, baby?

110
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:20,745
Mister, I told you, you can't
be in here harassing folks.

111
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:22,066
What's going on?

112
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:25,910
I paid these damn cops off,
and they're rousting my customers.

113
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,594
That's what he get for messing
with that white woman.

114
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:31,996
Don't pay him no attention.

115
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:35,079
I done rung for Junior
to take care of that.

116
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,322
They got nobody but Deucy
and them tonight.

117
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:41,926
I had Holiday on Thursday.
Yeah, you missed it.

118
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,811
Wait for the cops to leave.
Take Easy upstairs.

119
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:51,215
And if he's still down here,
come on back and throw his ass out.

120
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:53,818
Get out of here.
You better be gone.

121
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:55,540
I'll be here waiting.

122
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,703
You just wait, mister.
Just keep waiting.

123
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,666
Mr. McGee, there is no upstairs.

124
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,908
-Got another cigarette?
-Sure.

125
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,430
Zapattas. How you smoke
these damn things?

126
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:09,033
You the only Negro
smoke Mexican cigarettes.

127
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:12,196
Last time I heard these fellas
was back in Houston.

128
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,679
The night Mouse pulled me off you.

129
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,762
-That's how you remember it?
-That's the way it was.

130
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:19,163
Look here...

131
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:22,246
...admit that you helped
Mouse kill Navrochet.

132
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:26,130
Get off that. You know I didn't
have nothing to do with that.

133
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:31,696
Where the white women?

134
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,858
-I pay them no mind.
-I bet.

135
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,901
Like you didn't help Mouse
kill his stepfather.

136
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:40,024
Did you help him
kill his stepbrother too?

137
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,653
Give me a setup and a Coke back.

138
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:13,778
Have you seen a girl named Dahlia,
Delila, something like that?

139
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,500
White girl, supposed to
be something to see.

140
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:20,024
If I do see her,
I'll keep her to myself.

141
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:42,647
Keep the change.

142
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:46,010
Deacon Odell.

143
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:50,254
How you doing tonight?

144
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:53,017
It's going all right.
It sure is going.

145
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,299
Easy Rawlins, is that you?

146
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,744
-Ain't jumped out of no windows yet?
-Not yet, Dupree.

147
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:02,827
-You know Coretta, don't you?
-Sure, how you doing?

148
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
I'm all right.

149
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,910
This is Odell.

150
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,555
Can we sit with y'all?

151
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:12,917
Sure.

152
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:16,160
We miss you down at the plant.

153
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,243
Benny would've gave you
your job back, right?

154
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:22,366
All you had to do was go
and say you was sorry.

155
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:24,849
I'm sorry, all right.
Give me that bourbon.

156
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,172
Any man without his paycheck
is sure enough sorry.

157
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:33,177
I got it.
Your money ain't no good.

158
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:35,139
-This one's mine.
-You sure?

159
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,063
-You the one ain't got no job.
-You the one ain't got no money.

160
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,907
Y'all seen a white girl named Dahlia...

161
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:46,110
...or Delila?
First name start with a " D."

162
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:54,238
Coretta got herself a job
at the phone company.

163
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,883
Congratulations. They ain't
hiring no mans down there?

164
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:29,914
You all right, Odell?

165
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:43,247
He used to play till the cock crowed.

166
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:49,093
That old cock don't crow
nearly so much now.

167
00:16:57,902 --> 00:16:59,744
I better get on home.

168
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,388
You'd be sorry if you go.

169
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,310
I'd be sorry if I stay too.

170
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:08,833
Good night.

171
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:14,358
Daphne asleep by now...

172
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,804
...so you can't get
none of that tonight.

173
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:24,649
Go around here
telling everybody " Dahlia."

174
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:35,179
Her name is Daphne.

175
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:39,824
Do you know her?

176
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:59,644
-Where you want me to put him?
-This ain't my house!

177
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,006
This ain't my house.

178
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:04,128
Just throw him on the bed.

179
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,930
Shut up.

180
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:10,855
Be careful. The door.

181
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:14,418
Threw him out of his place
because he couldn't pay rent.

182
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:16,500
I shouldn't let him sleep here.

183
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:20,184
-Damn, that Negro's heavy.
-I know, I know.

184
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:25,429
I need a cigarette.

185
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,032
That all you need?

186
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:35,199
Sun catch me tiptoeing outside
your door, what your neighbours say?

187
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,802
All right, Easy.

188
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:41,365
Dupree fell asleep on me...

189
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:45,449
...and you just gonna walk out on me
like I was dog food, huh?

190
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,614
Girl, what you talking about?

191
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:51,936
Now, come on.

192
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:55,019
Coretta, your man is in the next room.

193
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,786
Tell me about your friend Daphne.

194
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,589
Why you keep asking about her?

195
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,075
Coloured women ain't good enough
for you no more?

196
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:12,677
That ain't it.

197
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:19,123
Shoot.

198
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,729
What if he heard something?

199
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,652
He asleep.

200
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,899
Daddy, that's it!

201
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,265
That's it.

202
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,670
You're hitting my spot.
You're hitting my spot.

203
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:53,237
Easy, Easy, Easy.

204
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:56,040
I can't give up
that much loving, daddy.

205
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,082
-Not the way things is.
-What things?

206
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,164
He's right in the next room.

207
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,847
Forget about Dupree.
You got me going.

208
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:06,811
It ain't right, doing this
right in the next room.

209
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:10,374
All you're doing is nosing
after my friend Daphne.

210
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,778
No, baby.

211
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:15,379
-That's just a job.
-What job?

212
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,622
-Some man want me to find her.
-What man?

213
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:19,303
I don't know what man.

214
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:22,226
I don't want nobody but you.

215
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,199
Daphne's my friend.
I can't do it.

216
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,174
Just a little bit, okay?

217
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,336
Just a little bit.

218
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:54,819
Just a little bit, baby.

219
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,750
Oh, you're hitting my spot.

220
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,472
You're hitting my spot.

221
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:16,921
And I went on hitting her spot
until just before sunup.

222
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:22,727
I realized Coretta had found out
as much about what I was up to...

223
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:25,369
...as I had found out
about Daphne Monet.

224
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,894
As it turned out, Todd Carter
wasn't the only man in Daphne's life.

225
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:34,498
She was shacking up with a smalltime
coloured gangster named Frank Green.

226
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,782
Coretta had the nerve to charge me
$10 for that information.

227
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:40,344
Everybody was in business in L.A.

228
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:45,109
That morning, I waited
for Albright to call.

229
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:48,072
I tried to feel good
about paying a few bills...

230
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:49,794
...and I mean just a few.

231
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:53,517
Shoot, a loaf of bread
was damn near 15 cents.

232
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:55,439
It was easy money.

233
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,441
Too easy.

234
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,604
Bye, Easy!

235
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:02,887
-Where you going, Sophie?
-Back to Texas.

236
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,169
Too fast for me out here.

237
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:13,097
Get on away from the house!

238
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:15,099
Get away from that tree!

239
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:20,264
Get on away from that tree!

240
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:23,427
Get away from that tree!

241
00:23:27,692 --> 00:23:29,453
Easy, how you doing?

242
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,617
I hope you have good news for me.

243
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:36,500
-Mr. Albright, is that you?
-Sure is. What's shaking?

244
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:39,343
-I got what you want.
-Hold on to that.

245
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,466
I only do business in person.
Tell you what.

246
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:47,792
You come out here to Malibu.
Meet me at Fishermans Pier in an hour.

247
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:50,514
Malibu? Mr. Albright, I don't--

248
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,062
It's pretty out here.

249
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:01,025
It's all right.

250
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,432
I'm from Des Moines, lowa.

251
00:25:09,153 --> 00:25:10,675
Where are you from?

252
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:13,838
Texas.

253
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,123
Do they have an ocean in Texas?

254
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:23,888
-A gulf in Texas.
-Barbara! Where are you?

255
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,490
Your friends are looking for you.

256
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,372
Who cares?

257
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,936
My sister brought me here
because my parents made her.

258
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:36,821
All she wants to do is make out
with Herman and smoke cigarettes.

259
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,785
What you doing here?

260
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:43,427
-What's going on?
-Leave us alone.

261
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:44,749
We're just talking.

262
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:47,752
-We don't need you talking to her.
-Leave us alone.

263
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:49,273
We're just talking.

264
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:52,637
This nigger's trying
to pick up on Barbara.

265
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:55,399
I don't need trouble.
Just being polite.

266
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,202
No, you're not.
You're talking about the ocean.

267
00:26:00,404 --> 00:26:02,246
-What do you want?
-What's going on?

268
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:03,848
What do you want?

269
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:05,570
What do I want?

270
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,173
I wanna see your brains.

271
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:10,494
Run!

272
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:11,656
Sorry.

273
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:14,258
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
-You're sorry?

274
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,980
-Sorry enough?
-Yes, sir.

275
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,021
Yeah?

276
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:18,543
Then prove it.

277
00:26:18,783 --> 00:26:21,586
Come on, prove it.
Show him.

278
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:23,187
Get down on your knees.

279
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:25,910
Suck his peter, you son of a bitch!

280
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,152
I think he's got the point.

281
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:30,074
-Go on.
-He's got the point!

282
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:34,158
Do it! I'll kill you.
I'll blow your brains out.

283
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,561
Don't shoot me, please.

284
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,602
Go on.

285
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:39,764
Go on.

286
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,932
Son of a gun, you're gonna do it,
aren't you?

287
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,094
Sick bastard.

288
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:52,857
Oh, no, my eye!

289
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,460
Get out!

290
00:26:57,902 --> 00:27:02,346
-You call the cops, I'll kill you!
-Hurry up, man. Come on!

291
00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:08,593
I don't think they'd call the cops,
but we better get out of here.

292
00:27:09,273 --> 00:27:10,274
What do you got?

293
00:27:10,474 --> 00:27:13,517
No harm will come
to that girl because of me?

294
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,881
Carter says he wants to live
happily ever after with her.

295
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:18,482
What you got?

296
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:22,727
-She was with a man named Frank Green.
-Hang on. Where?

297
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:26,450
Skylar Apartments.
Skylar and 83rd.

298
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:29,654
Frank Green.
What do you know about this guy?

299
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:33,938
He's a gangster. Hijacks liquor
and cigarettes. Good with a knife.

300
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:36,901
-Seen him in action?
-No, I just heard about him.

301
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:45,630
Here's another 1 00.

302
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,511
I'll be calling you again.

303
00:28:04,328 --> 00:28:06,290
Mr. Rawlins, I'm Detective Miller.

304
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,972
Mason. Hands on the car.

305
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:09,654
-Come with us.
-Where?

306
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,536
-You'll see.
-Why am I arrested?

307
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:14,258
-You'll see.
-I got a right to know why.

308
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:18,342
You got a right to fall down,
break your face and come with me.

309
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,992
-You got him?
-Got him coming home.

310
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:44,609
Ezekiel Rawlins. You can take
those cuffs off if you cooperate.

311
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,852
-Yes, sir, I'm cooperating.
-Turn around.

312
00:28:52,216 --> 00:28:54,178
Sit over there. Sit down.

313
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:01,586
Where were you this morning
about 5 a.m.?

314
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:02,987
What?

315
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:04,989
He means this morning!

316
00:29:08,953 --> 00:29:11,996
I was out drinking.
I carried a friend into his house.

317
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:14,559
I don't know.
I didn't look at a clock.

318
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:21,405
You were drinking at 89th and Central,
illegal club called John's.

319
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:24,769
Answer. You got a lot bigger
troubles than an illegal bar.

320
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:27,612
-What you talking about?
-We're talking about...

321
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:32,216
...taking your black ass out
and putting a bullet in your head.

322
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:33,497
Sit down.

323
00:29:40,464 --> 00:29:42,627
When did you leave
Coretta James' house?

324
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,508
Around 5:30, I guess.

325
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,071
-Did you go back later?
-No, sir, I did not.

326
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,914
Did you and Dupree have words
over Miss James?

327
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:51,315
-Words?
-You heard him!

328
00:29:51,596 --> 00:29:53,197
Did you two argue over Coretta?

329
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:56,040
-Did you?
-No, we didn't argue about nothing!

330
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,522
-He was asleep!
-She went to sleep too.

331
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:01,085
But she won't wake up.

332
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:04,849
-Where did you go when you left?
-Wait.

333
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:06,611
She won't wake up?

334
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:09,694
-Where'd you go?
-I don't know! I had a hangover!

335
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:12,296
-You had a hangover.
-I went home!

336
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,898
That explains everything.

337
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:15,059
He had a hangover.

338
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,382
Back off!

339
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:21,025
Back off! Back off!

340
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:22,506
Get out of here!

341
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:25,229
Let's go! Get out of here!

342
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,112
Come on, you son of a bitch!

343
00:30:28,713 --> 00:30:30,034
Calm down!

344
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,597
You son of a bitch.

345
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,013
They left me alone in
that musty room for 3 hours...

346
00:30:49,253 --> 00:30:53,538
... till some guy in a suit about
two sizes too big said I could go.

347
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:59,183
The game of cops and niggers kept up
outside, but I hardly noticed.

348
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,867
I had seen dead bodies before.

349
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:04,869
Cold, hard...

350
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,951
...still as concrete...

351
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:09,634
... eyes wide open,
staring up at nothing.

352
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,276
But not Coretta.

353
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:15,199
I could still feel her heartbeat.

354
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:32,456
Hey, Ezekiel Rawlins.

355
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:36,661
Somebody in the back
would like to talk to you.

356
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:38,903
I ain't got time.

357
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:41,105
Get in. We'll take you.

358
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:51,996
My boss wants to talk to you
about Coretta James.

359
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,044
If he wanted to hurt you,
it would've happened already.

360
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:01,245
Come on.

361
00:32:03,728 --> 00:32:05,089
Get in.

362
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:34,438
Go up front and sit with Norman.

363
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,160
Give me a kiss.

364
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:45,810
That's my adopted son, Jesus.

365
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,254
I can see the police
roughed you up a bit.

366
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,620
That's a practice of theirs
that has to change.

367
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,662
That has to change.

368
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,304
She was beaten...

369
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:04,949
...and died of a heavy blow
to the back of the head.

370
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:09,033
I suppose you know that.

371
00:33:09,674 --> 00:33:11,275
No, I didn't, Mr. Terell.

372
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:14,559
-You know who I am?
-I read the newspapers.

373
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,841
You're running for mayor
against Carter.

374
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:19,564
I am the next mayor, Mr. Rawlins.

375
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,687
And, luckily for you,
a friend of the Negro.

376
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:25,610
Coretta worked a while for me.

377
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,254
She answered phones at my campaign
office on 1 03rd and Western.

378
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:34,258
So when I heard that
the police had a suspect...

379
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:38,342
...l got out of bed immediately
because of my concern.

380
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:42,947
Was there anyone with you,
Mr. Rawlins?

381
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:46,671
Anyone besides Mr. Dupree Brouchard?

382
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:47,952
No, sir.

383
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:51,876
A young lady named
Daphne Monet, perhaps?

384
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,201
Nobody.

385
00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:00,324
Of course not. Why would....

386
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:05,169
Why would you tell someone
whom you've only just met?

387
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:09,934
You can trust me.

388
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:12,336
There was nobody else there.

389
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,582
I believe you.

390
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,304
-Can we drop you off?
-No.

391
00:34:22,066 --> 00:34:23,067
I'll get out here.

392
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:27,351
-This must be quite out of your way.
-No, it's okay.

393
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,760
May I offer you cab fare?

394
00:34:37,802 --> 00:34:39,804
-No, thank you.
-Are you sure?

395
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,005
It's okay.

396
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:14,158
You're hitting my spot, baby.

397
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,843
Daphne asleep by now, so....

398
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:23,247
Go around here
telling everybody "Dahlia. "

399
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:26,771
Coloured women ain't
good enough for you no more?

400
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:31,415
All you doing is
nosing after my friend.

401
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:34,779
Coloured women ain't
good enough for you no more?

402
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:50,995
Is this Mr. Rawlins?

403
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:52,597
Who's this?

404
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:54,919
This is Daphne Monet.

405
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,444
-You're looking for me.
-Who told you that?

406
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,767
You know who told me.

407
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:04,769
Coretta.

408
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,492
She was found murdered this morning.

409
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:13,017
I don't know what I should do.

410
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:17,061
Do you care to talk to me alone,
or should I call the police?

411
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,503
Ain't no reason to call the police.

412
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:22,466
Then come over
and explain yourself to me.

413
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,630
I'm at the Ambassador Hotel.

414
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,673
This part of the hotel is white-only.

415
00:36:28,913 --> 00:36:33,077
So go to the side entrance,
and the bellboy will sneak you up.

416
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,750
Hello, Mr. Rawlins.

417
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,152
Hello, Miss Monet.

418
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:15,800
Should I think of you as a friend
of Coretta's or a private dick?

419
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:19,564
Well, I ain't no detective.

420
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:24,208
I was just hired by a fella
that works for Todd Carter.

421
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,974
I had to pay Coretta
not to tell you where I was.

422
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:32,056
She got you too.

423
00:37:36,981 --> 00:37:39,824
She definitely gave me
the wrong address.

424
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:43,387
-Where'd she say I was?
-Said you was in Watts.

425
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:46,751
At the Skylar Apartments
with a fella named Frank Green.

426
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:50,715
What else did she tell you?

427
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:53,477
I don't know.
What else is there?

428
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:54,919
Nothing.

429
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,924
I make no apology for my feelings
for Frank. He's very dear to me.

430
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:01,045
Bourbon?

431
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:02,847
Please, straight up.

432
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:07,131
How well did you know Coretta?

433
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:10,254
She was a very close friend.

434
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,697
Maybe you know why she got killed?

435
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,902
Why would I know that?

436
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:21,586
She was your friend.
She knew about you and Frank.

437
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:24,228
Maybe somebody wanted
to keep that secret.

438
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,033
-Mr. Rawlins, if you think--
-Easy. You can call me Easy.

439
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,516
Easy, if you think
Frank killed Coretta...

440
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,679
...you don't know
very much about him.

441
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,004
Frank doesn't beat people up. He
prefers to use a knife as his weapon.

442
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,608
What do you prefer as your weapon?

443
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:50,494
Why not search me and find out?

444
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,601
Mind if I have another drink?

445
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:19,523
Help yourself.

446
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:26,931
-Listen, Mr. Rawlins--
-Easy.

447
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:28,332
Easy...

448
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,656
...l called to ask you
to drive me to Todd's house.

449
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:34,859
Pardon?

450
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,503
You found me. Now I want you
to take me to Todd Carter's.

451
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,587
Call Todd Carter.
Have him send for you.

452
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,311
I have to go someplace
else on the way.

453
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:50,635
Someplace I don't want
Todd to know about.

454
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,962
There's a man named Richard McGee.

455
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,124
He lives up in Laurel Canyon.

456
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:03,167
He delivered a letter of mine
to the wrong place...

457
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,689
...and I must get it back.

458
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:06,971
At 4:00 in the morning?

459
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:09,253
Important letter.

460
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:11,335
Yes, it is.

461
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:14,859
But I need to go there
before I go to Todd's.

462
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,181
I'll pay you.

463
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:21,546
When did you talk to Coretta?

464
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,871
I don't know, 7:30, 8:00, I guess.

465
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:28,873
Listen, Easy, I don't want...

466
00:40:31,035 --> 00:40:32,557
...to talk about Coretta now.

467
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:34,278
Did you go to her house?

468
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:44,569
No.

469
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,972
She called me.

470
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,577
She was in a good mood.

471
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,100
She always....

472
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:59,343
I didn't mean to upset you, Daphne.

473
00:41:00,144 --> 00:41:01,866
But you understand that...

474
00:41:02,186 --> 00:41:05,509
...you was the last one to talk
to her before she got killed.

475
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,312
I don't mean to upset you...

476
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:11,596
...but as far as I know,
you were the last one to see her.

477
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:15,640
Now, where does that leave us?

478
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:27,211
All right, change out of
that housecoat. I'll carry you.

479
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:43,387
Are you nervous?

480
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,590
Nervous? Here I was...

481
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,953
...at night, in a white neighbourhood
with a white woman.

482
00:41:49,313 --> 00:41:50,555
I wasn't nervous.

483
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:52,276
I was stupid.

484
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:54,759
Make a left up here.

485
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:59,003
Getting Daphne back to Todd Carter
suddenly didn't seem so easy.

486
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,686
Who was this guy Richard McGee?

487
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:04,048
Just park behind that car.

488
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,255
Oh, my God!

489
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:14,719
-Who's that at the door?
-It's him.

490
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,361
You fought in Europe?

491
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:21,806
What you doing in my house?

492
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,889
What happened to your head?

493
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,854
What you doing in my house? You got
no right to break into my house!

494
00:45:31,576 --> 00:45:33,177
Where have you been?

495
00:45:33,658 --> 00:45:36,741
I went to see a girl. Why?
You don't get none?

496
00:45:36,941 --> 00:45:39,023
I didn't come here to play, nigger.

497
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:44,869
That's my money in your pocket.

498
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,032
We've been by the address
you gave me on Frank.

499
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:50,074
But he moved from there.

500
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:51,435
A year ago.

501
00:45:52,036 --> 00:45:54,919
What do you want me to do?
I'll give you the money--

502
00:45:56,681 --> 00:45:58,442
Do you believe in God?

503
00:45:58,883 --> 00:46:02,406
I'm curious if pain's any different
for a religious man.

504
00:46:02,607 --> 00:46:05,409
-I'll show you what I do to liars.
-I seen her.

505
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,811
Where?

506
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,575
Come on.

507
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:14,819
She called me. I carried her
up to the Hollywood Hills.

508
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,582
-Where's she now?
-She took off.

509
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,223
Bullshit. Where is she?

510
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:21,866
She took off.

511
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:25,269
While I was looking at the dead man,
she took off.

512
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:34,759
Come on in.

513
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:42,486
Sit down.

514
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,856
What'd she do? Take his car?

515
00:46:53,698 --> 00:46:54,979
McGee.

516
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,181
Write down where you picked her up.

517
00:47:00,504 --> 00:47:01,906
Write it down!

518
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,764
This bologna is stuck in my molar.

519
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:23,247
I get that with popcorn.

520
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,852
Get me some whiskey.

521
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:32,496
It's in the cabinet.
You get it your damn self.

522
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:40,104
He's got balls,
you gotta give him that.

523
00:47:40,665 --> 00:47:41,505
Shoot him.

524
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,628
I'm just kidding.

525
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,880
Easy, you're a brave man.

526
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,122
I need brave men working for me.

527
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:00,124
You do a nice job too.

528
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,046
Get me a whiskey.

529
00:48:03,608 --> 00:48:05,970
Find Frank Green.
He'll lead us to her.

530
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,052
No, thank you.

531
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,976
Too many people getting killed
around me already.

532
00:48:18,222 --> 00:48:20,504
You're connectible to two murders.

533
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:26,230
You're gonna do whatever
I tell you to do.

534
00:48:28,312 --> 00:48:30,715
You find him.
I'll be checking in.

535
00:48:37,962 --> 00:48:40,244
That's some cheap shit.
Let's go.

536
00:48:57,982 --> 00:49:00,384
Since Albright liked
surprise parties...

537
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,628
...l had a friend of my own
I wanted to invite.

538
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:06,831
I placed a call to
Etta Mae Alexander in Houston.

539
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,193
I gave her a message
for her husband...

540
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:10,234
...Mouse.

541
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:37,301
Cast your vote on June 1 1
for Matthew Terell.

542
00:49:58,843 --> 00:50:00,965
That girl called me last night.

543
00:50:01,205 --> 00:50:02,246
What girl?

544
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:05,089
The one your friend Albright
is looking for.

545
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:09,854
-That's lucky.
-It wasn't no luck. It was you.

546
00:50:11,295 --> 00:50:15,900
Only you and Coretta had my number
and knew I was looking for the girl.

547
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,422
Coretta was too busy scamming Daphne.

548
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:21,465
-It was you.
-Maybe she looked in the phone book.

549
00:50:21,706 --> 00:50:24,268
I ain't in the book.
I thought you was my friend.

550
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,711
Why didn't you tell him
where she was?

551
00:50:26,911 --> 00:50:30,555
What the hell you mean, looking
all ugly like you'll do something?

552
00:50:31,035 --> 00:50:33,037
I think I'll do something.

553
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:35,840
Stop that shit!

554
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:40,284
That's my marble! My uncle
left me that after he died!

555
00:50:40,565 --> 00:50:42,887
Goddamn it,
he's about to get it back.

556
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:44,969
-Let's talk.
-Talk!

557
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,651
What you got me into?

558
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:48,893
I told her Albright
was looking for her.

559
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:52,416
I figured I'd help you make
a few dollars and throw Albright off!

560
00:50:52,737 --> 00:50:55,700
She wanted to know about you.
I gave her your number.

561
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,381
-Where's she at?
-I don't know!

562
00:50:57,662 --> 00:50:59,063
Don't lie to me!

563
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:00,504
I'm not lying to you!

564
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:03,668
-What's she running from, then?
-She didn't tell me.

565
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:08,873
Easy, look at me.
I am your friend!

566
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,037
I didn't mean to get you
in no trouble.

567
00:51:14,278 --> 00:51:16,160
Look, you seen her.

568
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,923
I mean, she is something else, man.

569
00:51:21,205 --> 00:51:23,047
You know what I'm saying?

570
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,892
Oh, Joppy....

571
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,498
What?

572
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,749
Like Albright said,
"When you're mixed up in something...

573
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:47,431
...you better be mixed up
to the top. "

574
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:49,594
So that's where I was going.

575
00:51:49,834 --> 00:51:51,836
All the way to the top.

576
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:56,841
Everybody was peeing on my head
and telling me it was rain.

577
00:51:57,041 --> 00:52:00,765
Guess they figured I was some new
kind of fool, and maybe I was.

578
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:03,367
I was ready to start fighting back.

579
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:07,171
I believed somehow that I could
live through this bad dream...

580
00:52:07,531 --> 00:52:09,854
...about pretty girls and gangsters...

581
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:13,978
...and standing face-to-face
with the richest man in town.

582
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:31,155
May I help you?

583
00:52:31,355 --> 00:52:35,119
-I'm looking for Mr. Carter.
-I'm sorry, he's a very busy man.

584
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:38,963
Too busy to hear about that
chippy of his that dumped him?

585
00:52:39,483 --> 00:52:40,605
Excuse me.

586
00:52:41,285 --> 00:52:43,768
-Mr.--?
-Rawlins.

587
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:47,091
Why don't you come with me, sir?

588
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:54,258
It's not smart talking about
Carter's business to a secretary.

589
00:52:54,498 --> 00:52:56,180
There's too much going on...

590
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,624
...for me to give a damn about
what you think is smart.

591
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:15,439
Wait here, Mr. Rawlins.

592
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:29,453
Mr. Carter will see you.

593
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,377
Mr. Rawlins.

594
00:53:33,618 --> 00:53:35,059
Mr. Carter.

595
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,782
You've heard from Daphne?

596
00:53:38,062 --> 00:53:39,664
Yeah, last night.

597
00:53:40,064 --> 00:53:41,626
She's still in town?

598
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:43,427
She was last night.

599
00:53:44,629 --> 00:53:47,151
And what did she say?

600
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:49,033
What was she wearing?

601
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:52,917
Blue dress, high heels.

602
00:53:53,157 --> 00:53:54,038
That's her.

603
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,040
Would you like to come in?

604
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:57,602
Please.

605
00:54:00,565 --> 00:54:03,087
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

606
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:05,690
-I want some answers.
-Would you like a brandy?

607
00:54:06,851 --> 00:54:09,453
I wanna know what I got myself into.

608
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:10,935
Pardon?

609
00:54:12,056 --> 00:54:15,339
I wanna know the real reason
Mr. Albright hired me.

610
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,342
Mr. Albright?

611
00:54:19,103 --> 00:54:21,986
Yeah, the man you hired
to find Daphne.

612
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:25,349
I think there's been a mistake here.

613
00:54:28,152 --> 00:54:29,954
Who are you talking about?

614
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:31,556
Wait a minute.

615
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,679
You didn't hire somebody
to find your girl?

616
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:36,200
Of course not.

617
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:41,005
Until just now, I thought she was
hundreds of miles away from here.

618
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,729
You say someone's looking for her?

619
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:48,532
Someone's looking for her.

620
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:53,537
Nothing personal,
but what's going on between y'all?

621
00:54:54,178 --> 00:54:55,379
Nothing.

622
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,743
We were going to get married.

623
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:03,507
We had a fight, and it is
really none of your concern.

624
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:05,590
So someone's after her.

625
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,912
Mr. Albright.

626
00:55:08,593 --> 00:55:12,476
-And he says I'm his employer.
-Ever heard of Richard McGee?

627
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:14,518
Who?

628
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:18,683
Look, l....

629
00:55:19,804 --> 00:55:23,247
-Why would somebody be after her?
-Can you find her again?

630
00:55:23,928 --> 00:55:25,449
It's important...

631
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,051
...for her sake.

632
00:55:28,172 --> 00:55:30,014
I'm willing to pay you.

633
00:55:30,254 --> 00:55:31,936
Why did she leave?

634
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:37,461
It's really none of your concern,
but I'll pay you to find her.

635
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:45,389
$1 000.

636
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:47,832
$1 000?

637
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:50,915
I'll take $200 right now.

638
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:53,077
You're trying to
take advantage of me.

639
00:55:53,277 --> 00:55:55,239
Let me inform you of something.

640
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:59,083
The incumbent mayor, the chief
of police, close friends of mine.

641
00:55:59,483 --> 00:56:01,646
They eat at my house regularly.

642
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:04,368
That's good. Then they
can help us find her.

643
00:56:08,052 --> 00:56:09,614
No, they can't.

644
00:56:11,776 --> 00:56:14,218
I'll have Baxter
write you out a check.

645
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,020
Why you stop running for mayor?

646
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,824
-Baxter will write you a check.
-Why's Terell looking for Daphne?

647
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:21,866
Baxter will write you a check.

648
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:24,388
I'll take cash.

649
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,798
Here, take it all.
Just take it all.

650
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:40,284
I'll be in touch, Mr. Carter.

651
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,502
So Albright had lied to me.

652
00:56:58,703 --> 00:57:01,545
Instead of working for Carter,
he worked for Terell...

653
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:04,068
... the man running for mayor
against Carter.

654
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:06,871
And they was all
throwing money my way...

655
00:57:07,111 --> 00:57:09,313
... to find the girl
in the blue dress.

656
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:13,558
I knew her boyfriend Frank Green
hijacked trucks hauling liquor...

657
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:17,361
...and sold it at half-price
to places down on Central Avenue.

658
00:57:17,682 --> 00:57:21,365
So I decided to kick up some dust
right in Frank's back yard.

659
00:57:33,457 --> 00:57:35,419
Mr. Rawlins, what were you saying?

660
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,741
Frank Green.

661
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:38,302
-Who?
-I'm looking for him.

662
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,905
-I don't know.
-Why you treat me like this?

663
00:57:41,185 --> 00:57:44,028
-I don't know any Frank Green.
-You don't know Frank?

664
00:57:44,268 --> 00:57:46,150
You know me though, don't you?

665
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:57,041
My man Frank Green
told me to talk to you.

666
00:57:57,281 --> 00:57:59,483
-He said to talk to you.
-Who is that?

667
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,527
What do you mean, "Who is that?"
He told me to talk to you.

668
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:06,330
Come on. Give me something.

669
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:09,093
All right, give me a beer.

670
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:11,856
Can I get a beer?
Can I get a beer?

671
00:58:12,136 --> 00:58:13,217
Thank you.

672
00:58:14,098 --> 00:58:17,021
Wait. Frank Green told me
you'd have pints for me.

673
00:58:17,221 --> 00:58:18,302
Who's Frank Green?

674
00:58:18,502 --> 00:58:22,667
-You know who Frank Green is.
-Al, talk to this man.

675
00:58:22,907 --> 00:58:25,910
-You know Frank.
-What are you talking about?

676
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:27,431
You don't know Frank?

677
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:29,914
-I don't.
-Let's get him on the phone.

678
00:58:41,606 --> 00:58:44,128
Don't need my trees trimmed.

679
00:58:52,977 --> 00:58:53,978
There's a man!

680
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:08,472
Damn! Frank, wait a minute!

681
00:59:08,673 --> 00:59:10,675
Hold it! Let's talk!

682
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:14,518
Let's talk.

683
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:21,606
Wait a minute!
I got $500 for you, Frank.

684
00:59:21,806 --> 00:59:23,327
Rich white man wants--

685
00:59:37,622 --> 00:59:38,943
Goddamn it!

686
00:59:49,914 --> 00:59:51,435
Want me to shoot him?

687
00:59:51,636 --> 00:59:54,038
-Mouse!
-Want me to shoot him?

688
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:00,845
It's all right.

689
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:03,367
What the hell is happening, man?

690
01:00:04,408 --> 01:00:05,730
I'll blow your nose off.

691
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,131
Don't shoot him!

692
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:11,896
Where's Daphne Monet, Frank?

693
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:15,139
Maybe you don't know where she is...

694
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,942
...but we can help
each other find her.

695
01:00:18,302 --> 01:00:20,665
-You heard him.
-Mouse, no!

696
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:28,753
-Rawlins residence.
-Sit down.

697
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:32,356
He busy right now.
You gonna have to call back.

698
01:00:37,682 --> 01:00:41,445
A rich man is willing to pay $1 000
just to talk to this girl.

699
01:00:43,447 --> 01:00:46,530
$1 000! That's a hell
of a lot of money, man!

700
01:00:49,373 --> 01:00:51,335
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.

701
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:53,217
Let me try.

702
01:00:56,741 --> 01:00:58,462
Look here--
It's Frank, right?

703
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:09,073
Let go of me, man!
Let go of me!

704
01:01:09,513 --> 01:01:10,595
Damn it!

705
01:01:12,156 --> 01:01:15,119
Don't you ever grab me
when I got a gun in my hand!

706
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,482
Shit!

707
01:01:20,645 --> 01:01:22,246
You got blood on my coat.

708
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:24,729
It's a damn expensive coat.

709
01:01:27,772 --> 01:01:29,734
Where's your bathroom at, man?

710
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,025
We gotta find that girl
and get that money.

711
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:43,387
No, we don't have to go find nobody!

712
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:47,271
I done changed my mind.
I don't need your kind of help.

713
01:01:47,752 --> 01:01:52,196
Man cut a damn smile in your neck,
you tell me you don't need my help.

714
01:01:52,436 --> 01:01:55,519
You pulled this shit 5 years ago
when you killed Navrochet.

715
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,763
You ain't been here 5 minutes,
you shot somebody already.

716
01:01:59,163 --> 01:02:00,284
Come on, Easy.

717
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:02,847
-Cut me in on this thing, man.
-No.

718
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:05,409
Easy, I'm trying to do right.

719
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:07,892
I mean, you know, now.

720
01:02:10,214 --> 01:02:14,098
I could help you.
You'll need somebody at your back.

721
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,542
-I'll let you run the show.
-You'll let me run the show?

722
01:02:18,783 --> 01:02:21,265
I won't do nothing
you don't tell me to do.

723
01:02:21,465 --> 01:02:23,908
You're gonna let me run the show?

724
01:02:26,711 --> 01:02:27,992
You'll do what I say?

725
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:30,635
I'm gonna do everything you say.

726
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:33,077
That's the wrong hand, Mouse.

727
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:38,723
Boy, how you been?

728
01:02:40,044 --> 01:02:42,887
-Who was that on the phone?
-I don't know, man.

729
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,969
Sounded like some white girl.

730
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,994
Ezekiel. Came to ask you
a few more questions.

731
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:14,158
-Why don't you invite us in?
-I'll come out.

732
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,361
What happened?

733
01:03:17,842 --> 01:03:20,124
I don't remember
doing that to your neck.

734
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:23,407
What do you know about Richard McGee?

735
01:03:23,648 --> 01:03:26,010
A dead white man in Laurel Canyon.

736
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:30,615
He has a note in his pocket
with " Coretta James" written on it.

737
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,216
You feel more talkative?

738
01:03:32,577 --> 01:03:35,900
I'll bet six bits to a bottle of piss
we're looking at a double.

739
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:38,743
If we place you
in the dead man's house.

740
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:40,705
I wasn't in no dead man's house.

741
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:43,748
We could go to the station,
send a team over here.

742
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:47,391
They'll find something that
will place you at that house.

743
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:49,994
Evidence has a funny way
of showing up.

744
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:53,557
You ain't got nothing on me,
because I ain't done nothing.

745
01:03:53,758 --> 01:03:55,239
We know you know a lot more.

746
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:57,041
Tell us everything you know...

747
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:59,684
...or you're going down
for both murders.

748
01:03:59,924 --> 01:04:01,766
-I don't know nothing.
-Sure you do.

749
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:04,008
-Let's go.
-All right, look.

750
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,090
-Give me more time.
-Forget it.

751
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:10,094
Give me till tomorrow morning.
Maybe I can dig something up.

752
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:14,659
What do you think?
We could do that.

753
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,741
Take the cuffs off.

754
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:19,463
You got till tomorrow morning.

755
01:04:23,187 --> 01:04:25,590
Have a nice evening, Ezekiel.

756
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:28,833
I played along, just like
the cops wanted me to.

757
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:31,315
It was a game to them.

758
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:35,239
But they'd play for keeps tomorrow
because a white man was dead now.

759
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:38,843
Guilty or not, somebody was
gonna have to pay for this one.

760
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:47,491
Is Dupree's sister's house
off Compton Boulevard or Avenue?

761
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:51,896
-We're going somewhere else first.
-Did that girl call?

762
01:04:52,817 --> 01:04:54,178
We going to see her?

763
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,661
No.

764
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:01,826
-I see them people giving you trouble.
-I ain't got time.

765
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,188
-Leave my trees alone!
-You got too many.

766
01:05:04,388 --> 01:05:08,512
-I'll knock down a couple for you.
-Leave my trees alone!

767
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:11,596
Tell me what you think
when you get back, all right?

768
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:47,672
-Who's there?
-Easy.

769
01:05:51,996 --> 01:05:53,958
-What you want?
-Let me in.

770
01:05:54,238 --> 01:05:57,201
I got no time to be fooling
with you. I'm sleeping.

771
01:05:57,481 --> 01:06:00,404
Open this door.
Act like you got some sense.

772
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:01,886
Mouse.

773
01:06:02,086 --> 01:06:04,809
Get out the way, fool.
We ain't got all day.

774
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,251
Have a seat.

775
01:06:07,612 --> 01:06:10,214
-Y'all want a beer?
-Sure. Thank you.

776
01:06:10,695 --> 01:06:13,097
What you smoking, Junior?
Zapattas?

777
01:06:19,864 --> 01:06:22,186
-This one's yours too.
-I don't know.

778
01:06:22,466 --> 01:06:23,387
You killed McGee.

779
01:06:24,228 --> 01:06:25,750
What you talking about?

780
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,912
No time to play.
I know you killed him.

781
01:06:28,232 --> 01:06:30,434
-You crazy, man!
-Sit down.

782
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,003
-Tell me.
-What you talking about?

783
01:06:39,243 --> 01:06:43,047
The police will, when they find your
prints in his house.

784
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:44,088
Fingerprints?

785
01:06:44,569 --> 01:06:47,612
Hattie had you pull that man
out of John's that night.

786
01:06:47,852 --> 01:06:51,135
He was laying dead in the same suit
and a bullet in his head.

787
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,697
I ain't killed nobody!

788
01:06:52,937 --> 01:06:56,100
Quit lying, you thick-headed,
cornbread-eating--

789
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:58,623
Sit down, Junior.

790
01:07:00,745 --> 01:07:02,346
Sit down, now.

791
01:07:11,676 --> 01:07:13,958
Tell me, and maybe
I'll forget what I know.

792
01:07:14,158 --> 01:07:16,400
Or I'll tell Mouse to shoot you.

793
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:18,963
You killed that man
and took his money.

794
01:07:19,123 --> 01:07:22,206
-I don't know who you talking about!
-You had to rob him!

795
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,809
I didn't touch nothing
in that man's house!

796
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,651
Goddamn.

797
01:07:30,294 --> 01:07:31,175
Sit down.

798
01:07:35,339 --> 01:07:37,501
Hattie had me take him
out to his car.

799
01:07:37,822 --> 01:07:41,065
He was so drunk he gave me $1 0
just to drive him home.

800
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,588
-I know you took that.
-Hell, yeah.

801
01:07:43,868 --> 01:07:47,191
Then he asked about that
white girl you asked about.

802
01:07:47,391 --> 01:07:50,554
I told him I seen her with Coretta.
What the hell I care?

803
01:07:50,795 --> 01:07:52,436
You tell him, but not me?

804
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:55,600
I don't like your ass.
And he give me $50.

805
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,962
Just to tell him
you saw her with Coretta?

806
01:07:58,162 --> 01:07:59,604
To deliver a letter.

807
01:08:00,645 --> 01:08:03,407
I give it to Coretta to give
to her the next morning.

808
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,052
You better be telling the truth.

809
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:09,854
Come on, let's go.

810
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:12,456
I'm telling the truth.
I ain't killed nobody.

811
01:08:12,737 --> 01:08:16,100
That man was alive when I left.
I ain't killed nobody!

812
01:08:17,862 --> 01:08:22,106
Daphne's letter had worked its way
over to the other side of town...

813
01:08:22,346 --> 01:08:24,308
... to Dupree's sister's house.

814
01:08:24,548 --> 01:08:25,830
I hoped.

815
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:28,913
And Junior was innocent,
like I knew all along.

816
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:33,437
But I couldn't see no harm in
letting the sucker sweat a little bit.

817
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:49,493
-Tried to call you.
-Cops just let me out today.

818
01:08:49,814 --> 01:08:52,777
My sister's at work.
I ain't feel much like talking.

819
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:55,179
-Raymond!
-Yeah, big man.

820
01:08:55,379 --> 01:08:58,262
Is them pig tails I smell up in there?

821
01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:00,905
Lula Mae made some before work.

822
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:02,987
You'll have to excuse me.

823
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:06,871
Dupree.

824
01:09:13,197 --> 01:09:14,518
I'm sorry.

825
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:18,122
Thank you, Easy.

826
01:09:18,963 --> 01:09:22,887
Why somebody wanna kill her like that?
It don't make sense to me.

827
01:09:30,214 --> 01:09:34,779
Did Coretta say anything to you
about a letter she was keeping?

828
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,061
A letter?

829
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:39,263
What kind of letter?

830
01:09:39,744 --> 01:09:41,185
From that white girl.

831
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:42,907
No.

832
01:09:43,588 --> 01:09:46,230
It's because of her
that Coretta got killed.

833
01:09:47,712 --> 01:09:48,753
Yeah.

834
01:09:49,473 --> 01:09:53,517
Everything between Daphne and Coretta
was always such a damn secret.

835
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,720
That old girl...

836
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,003
...didn't think nothing
about two-timing old Frank.

837
01:09:59,644 --> 01:10:02,927
-You want more tails?
-Thanks, Dupree.

838
01:10:03,808 --> 01:10:06,450
She messing around with
that guy running for mayor.

839
01:10:06,691 --> 01:10:09,574
-Todd Carter?
-Yeah, that's his name.

840
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:13,618
She probably introduced Coretta
to one of them guys.

841
01:10:14,098 --> 01:10:16,020
He probably came to the house...

842
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,783
...saw that Coretta wasn't
that type of woman.

843
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,306
Cop says she fought him.

844
01:10:23,948 --> 01:10:24,949
Imagine that.

845
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,952
My baby fought them.

846
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:32,677
Because she wouldn't
have nobody but me.

847
01:10:37,802 --> 01:10:39,243
I can't sleep.

848
01:10:42,046 --> 01:10:45,369
I keep seeing her face that morning
before I went to work.

849
01:10:48,012 --> 01:10:50,094
Junior had just came by the house...

850
01:10:50,294 --> 01:10:53,377
...and she come running out
carrying her Bible.

851
01:10:54,699 --> 01:10:56,220
She say...

852
01:10:57,181 --> 01:10:58,542
..." Keep this for me, baby."

853
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,667
The Bible?

854
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,833
The police won't even let me
go near the house.

855
01:11:10,554 --> 01:11:13,317
That's the only thing I got left
that belonged to her.

856
01:11:13,517 --> 01:11:14,518
The Bible.

857
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:20,725
I knew it was a sign
because she's so religious.

858
01:11:21,646 --> 01:11:23,447
Oh, God!

859
01:11:25,169 --> 01:11:26,931
It's all right, big man.

860
01:11:27,371 --> 01:11:29,894
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.

861
01:11:30,094 --> 01:11:32,416
Get you a drink. Drink this.

862
01:11:32,937 --> 01:11:35,820
-All right. Go on now.
-That's enough.

863
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,421
Drink that.

864
01:12:31,876 --> 01:12:33,598
I was scared now...

865
01:12:33,878 --> 01:12:35,920
...and sick from what I saw.

866
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,924
Pictures of a much younger
Matthew Terell and children.

867
01:12:40,404 --> 01:12:41,445
Innocent...

868
01:12:41,646 --> 01:12:43,007
...helpless...

869
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:44,368
...naked children.

870
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:49,734
I got it. Let's go.

871
01:12:50,655 --> 01:12:52,857
Is you crazy or is you drunk?

872
01:12:54,218 --> 01:12:55,379
Come on.

873
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,661
Am I drunk?

874
01:12:56,861 --> 01:12:59,984
You saw me draw that gun.
No man can out-draw me.

875
01:13:00,224 --> 01:13:02,787
-Put the gun down.
-No, I'm drunk.

876
01:13:03,027 --> 01:13:05,109
I'm drunk. You right.

877
01:13:06,711 --> 01:13:08,993
I'm gonna put that gun right there.

878
01:13:09,153 --> 01:13:11,636
I'm gonna see who's drunk.

879
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:16,240
Now, watch it now.
Watch it, goddamn it.

880
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:19,003
Right there, now.

881
01:13:20,244 --> 01:13:23,207
This fool calling me out,
he ain't even got no gun.

882
01:13:23,407 --> 01:13:25,329
I'll kill that motherfucker.

883
01:13:27,131 --> 01:13:27,972
Let him go.

884
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:31,175
Let him live.

885
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:33,578
And he'll be scared of you
from now on.

886
01:13:33,818 --> 01:13:35,740
He better be scared
or I'll kill him.

887
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,301
He will.

888
01:13:37,702 --> 01:13:38,703
You better tell him.

889
01:13:39,023 --> 01:13:40,384
I will.

890
01:13:40,665 --> 01:13:41,586
Trust me.

891
01:13:41,986 --> 01:13:43,387
I'll tell him.

892
01:13:44,589 --> 01:13:46,190
Shit.

893
01:13:48,993 --> 01:13:50,915
Keep an eye on him.

894
01:13:51,155 --> 01:13:52,717
Where you going?

895
01:14:13,257 --> 01:14:16,540
The pictures was eating at my pocket
like a cigarette burn.

896
01:14:16,741 --> 01:14:20,544
Albright killed for those pictures
to get them back for Terell.

897
01:14:20,745 --> 01:14:24,428
He killed Richard McGee,
who had sold the pictures to Daphne.

898
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:26,390
Time was running out.

899
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:29,674
But I had some unfinished
business with the girl.

900
01:14:30,034 --> 01:14:34,238
She had called earlier, and all
I needed was for her to call again.

901
01:15:11,515 --> 01:15:14,078
I'm sorry.
I broke into your house.

902
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,882
Please don't be angry with me.

903
01:15:18,562 --> 01:15:20,925
Now, why should I be angry at you?

904
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:28,733
May I have a cigarette?

905
01:15:33,938 --> 01:15:37,221
Coretta's boyfriend, Dupree,
got out of jail today.

906
01:15:37,942 --> 01:15:40,344
And you need me
to help you find him.

907
01:15:42,186 --> 01:15:44,508
I already got the pictures.

908
01:16:19,183 --> 01:16:22,266
I paid $7000 for those pictures.
They belong to me.

909
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:24,989
Terell might have
something to say about that.

910
01:16:26,671 --> 01:16:28,953
I'll pay you $1 000 for them.

911
01:16:29,193 --> 01:16:31,916
-You gave McGee seven.
-Then I'll give you seven.

912
01:16:32,436 --> 01:16:34,238
What does Terell have on you?

913
01:16:34,759 --> 01:16:36,000
Nothing.

914
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,362
-You want the money or not?
-No.

915
01:16:39,163 --> 01:16:40,805
I got two murders hanging over me.

916
01:16:41,085 --> 01:16:44,048
Unless I find a killer by morning,
I'll go to jail.

917
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:46,450
-Who killed Coretta?
-I don't know.

918
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:49,093
-She was killed for the pictures?
-I don't know.

919
01:16:49,373 --> 01:16:52,056
Frank Green killed her
to bring you them pictures.

920
01:16:52,296 --> 01:16:54,258
-No.
-Tell it to the police...

921
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,420
...because I ain't taking the rap.

922
01:16:58,462 --> 01:17:00,985
Put the phone down!
Put it down!

923
01:17:01,305 --> 01:17:02,747
Put the phone down!

924
01:17:03,547 --> 01:17:04,548
It was Frank.

925
01:17:04,749 --> 01:17:06,430
-He didn't do it!
-Sure he did!

926
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:08,713
You got more than a backdoor romance.

927
01:17:08,953 --> 01:17:11,916
He pimped you out to Carter.
We're going to the police.

928
01:17:12,797 --> 01:17:17,201
Why don't you scream, so I can tell
the police about your boyfriend!

929
01:17:17,401 --> 01:17:19,123
Frank is my brother!

930
01:17:22,767 --> 01:17:25,449
Our mother is Creole.
We have different fathers.

931
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,332
Mine is white.

932
01:17:29,974 --> 01:17:31,656
That's what Terell has on me.

933
01:17:33,337 --> 01:17:36,020
So far I've been able
to keep Frank out of this.

934
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,702
Who killed Coretta?

935
01:17:39,023 --> 01:17:42,506
It was an accident. She wanted
to sell the pictures to Terell.

936
01:17:42,747 --> 01:17:45,269
Who killed her, goddamn it?

937
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:48,392
I asked Joppy to scare her.

938
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:50,194
Joppy?

939
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:53,157
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

940
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:55,720
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

941
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,283
But Todd had to pull out
of the election because of me.

942
01:17:59,563 --> 01:18:02,807
His family really wanted us
to get married, but--

943
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:08,052
I'll be a son of a bitch.

944
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:09,133
Get her.

945
01:18:15,459 --> 01:18:16,901
Come on.

946
01:18:18,663 --> 01:18:20,825
-Where are the pictures?
-I don't know.

947
01:18:21,786 --> 01:18:23,387
Get her in the car.

948
01:18:25,469 --> 01:18:26,270
Come on!

949
01:18:26,591 --> 01:18:29,033
Who we gonna give up
to cover this shit?

950
01:18:56,661 --> 01:19:00,745
I woke up Mouse and told him to drive
Dupree's car to 34th and Central.

951
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,948
It had come to me in less time
than it takes to think.:

952
01:19:04,348 --> 01:19:08,593
They were taking her someplace more
deserted than Albright's office...

953
01:19:08,793 --> 01:19:10,995
... where there would be no witnesses.

954
01:19:11,195 --> 01:19:13,798
And I was being left alive
to take the fall.

955
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:32,617
Give me one of them guns you got.

956
01:19:33,097 --> 01:19:37,021
Start up my car, keep it hot.
I'm coming out fast.

957
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:06,771
Let's go.

958
01:20:07,211 --> 01:20:09,133
Let's go. Let's go!

959
01:20:09,694 --> 01:20:11,656
I'll blow your face off.
Let's go!

960
01:20:11,856 --> 01:20:13,217
Shut up!

961
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:19,103
-What the hell you doing?
-Shut up!

962
01:20:20,665 --> 01:20:21,906
What is this?

963
01:20:23,868 --> 01:20:25,429
You drive, Mouse.

964
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:39,403
Albright's gonna kill the girl.

965
01:20:39,604 --> 01:20:42,006
Now tell me where it is
and get it right.

966
01:20:42,206 --> 01:20:44,969
Get it right, Joppy.
Get it right.

967
01:20:45,129 --> 01:20:46,971
There's a cabin.

968
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,133
That's all I know.
There's a cabin.

969
01:20:49,413 --> 01:20:52,056
-Where?
-It's in Malibu on Route 9.

970
01:20:52,256 --> 01:20:54,378
Make a right turn at the alley.

971
01:20:58,943 --> 01:21:00,665
This is where he'll be, right?

972
01:21:00,865 --> 01:21:02,667
-I guess so.
-Don't be guessing!

973
01:21:02,867 --> 01:21:07,271
He done this kind of thing
out there before, so I guess so.

974
01:21:07,872 --> 01:21:09,754
I thought y'all were friends.

975
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,636
He killed Coretta.

976
01:21:12,396 --> 01:21:13,758
You lying.

977
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:15,920
I ain't done nothing like that.

978
01:21:20,164 --> 01:21:22,326
Hold on!
We need him, Mouse!

979
01:21:22,566 --> 01:21:24,809
The girl got $7000.

980
01:21:28,492 --> 01:21:29,253
What?

981
01:21:29,533 --> 01:21:32,777
The girl offered to pay me
$7000 for them pictures.

982
01:21:32,977 --> 01:21:34,298
Oh, my God!

983
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:36,340
Oh, my goodness!

984
01:21:36,581 --> 01:21:37,381
Oh, my God!

985
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,762
How much further is it?

986
01:21:58,162 --> 01:21:59,844
We coming up on it.

987
01:22:20,184 --> 01:22:22,587
There's rope in the trunk.
Tie him up.

988
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:24,228
Yeah, all right.

989
01:22:32,196 --> 01:22:33,718
Man, come on.

990
01:22:34,278 --> 01:22:38,162
The girl is lying if she told you
I killed that woman.

991
01:22:38,963 --> 01:22:40,805
Who says she told me?

992
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:48,532
I'm gonna shoot him now, okay?

993
01:22:48,853 --> 01:22:49,894
No, don't.

994
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:52,416
Don't shoot.

995
01:23:44,669 --> 01:23:47,511
Help me! Help me!

996
01:23:57,722 --> 01:23:58,923
Shut up!

997
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:07,692
Now, you tell me
where the pictures are.

998
01:24:07,932 --> 01:24:10,374
I don't want to hurt you.
Tell me.

999
01:24:10,655 --> 01:24:12,096
Where are the pictures?

1000
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:16,060
-Easy has them.
-You said he had nothing to do with it.

1001
01:24:16,861 --> 01:24:18,663
I was lying.

1002
01:24:21,185 --> 01:24:22,266
Lying?

1003
01:24:23,868 --> 01:24:25,630
Yeah, you a liar?

1004
01:24:29,553 --> 01:24:32,917
I know you lie.
You lie about being a nigger?

1005
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,721
Tell me the truth.

1006
01:24:38,162 --> 01:24:40,244
What part of you is nigger?
Your leg?

1007
01:24:40,484 --> 01:24:42,887
Your arm a nigger?
Maybe your face?

1008
01:24:46,731 --> 01:24:48,532
What part of you is nigger?

1009
01:24:50,254 --> 01:24:51,896
You know what I'm gonna do?

1010
01:24:52,897 --> 01:24:53,938
Please, no!

1011
01:24:54,338 --> 01:24:56,701
I'm gonna burn it out of you.

1012
01:25:58,122 --> 01:25:59,884
Easy, is that you?

1013
01:27:13,357 --> 01:27:14,959
He gone, man.

1014
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:21,606
Gone.

1015
01:27:31,616 --> 01:27:33,137
You all right?

1016
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:36,621
Can you walk?

1017
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:38,502
Come on, let's go.

1018
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,083
Where's Joppy?

1019
01:28:02,326 --> 01:28:03,407
Where Joppy?

1020
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:06,010
He right there.

1021
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:18,663
What happened?

1022
01:28:19,463 --> 01:28:21,946
I ain't had no time
to be tying him up.

1023
01:28:22,587 --> 01:28:23,547
What?

1024
01:28:24,428 --> 01:28:25,910
You said don't shoot him.

1025
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:28,152
-That's right.
-Well, I didn't.

1026
01:28:28,352 --> 01:28:29,754
I choked him.

1027
01:28:30,635 --> 01:28:31,636
What?

1028
01:28:32,076 --> 01:28:35,880
How am I gonna help you out
if I'm here fooling around with him?

1029
01:28:39,644 --> 01:28:43,407
If you ain't want him killed,
why'd you leave him with me?

1030
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:51,535
Come on. We got to go, Easy.

1031
01:28:54,659 --> 01:28:56,941
Easy, come on. Let's go now.

1032
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,922
Listen...

1033
01:29:18,482 --> 01:29:20,204
...what about that dude Frank?

1034
01:29:20,404 --> 01:29:23,527
-I can run by and kill him before I go.
-No, Mouse.

1035
01:29:23,768 --> 01:29:24,889
You sure?

1036
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:30,775
Look.

1037
01:29:31,535 --> 01:29:32,617
Here's your half.

1038
01:29:32,817 --> 01:29:36,540
I know you's too big a fool
to take it from her yourself.

1039
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:40,585
If you need somebody to run
them streets with, give me a call.

1040
01:29:40,785 --> 01:29:43,427
You know how to put money
in a nigger's pocket.

1041
01:30:03,728 --> 01:30:06,691
What upset them the most
was that I didn't tell them.

1042
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:10,815
Then Terell threatened
to go public about my mother.

1043
01:30:11,055 --> 01:30:13,457
That just added insult to injury.

1044
01:30:14,218 --> 01:30:15,660
When Todd sees the pictures...

1045
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:18,302
...there'll be nothing
in the way of our marriage.

1046
01:30:18,502 --> 01:30:22,466
-Are you sure?
-Terell doesn't want to go to jail.

1047
01:30:22,947 --> 01:30:24,949
I'm not talking about Terell.

1048
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:29,313
Todd and I are very much in love,
and in the end...

1049
01:30:30,755 --> 01:30:33,077
...his family just wants him
to be happy.

1050
01:30:37,802 --> 01:30:41,726
Daphne had gotten the money
out of a locker at the YWCA.

1051
01:30:41,926 --> 01:30:44,689
It was money she had gotten
from Carter's family.

1052
01:30:45,089 --> 01:30:47,011
$30, 000...

1053
01:30:47,612 --> 01:30:49,253
... to leave town.

1054
01:30:50,054 --> 01:30:53,057
She was convinced
her Negro blood didn't matter...

1055
01:30:53,257 --> 01:30:55,539
...now that Terell couldn't use it...

1056
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:58,102
... to keep Carter
out of the mayor's race.

1057
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:01,706
She was in love and
couldn't see for dreaming...

1058
01:31:02,386 --> 01:31:04,629
...any better than
the rest of us, I guess.

1059
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:08,552
Even though we had fought a war
to keep the world free...

1060
01:31:08,793 --> 01:31:11,235
... the colour line in America
work both ways.

1061
01:31:11,475 --> 01:31:13,918
Even a rich white man
like Todd Carter...

1062
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,440
... was afraid to cross it.

1063
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,522
-Don't walk away.
-Damn you!

1064
01:31:19,403 --> 01:31:20,484
Wait.

1065
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:23,728
Wait.

1066
01:31:30,374 --> 01:31:31,616
Please!

1067
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:56,440
Here's the $800 that I owe you.

1068
01:31:57,481 --> 01:31:59,403
And thank you for protecting her.

1069
01:32:01,926 --> 01:32:03,567
You have some pictures.

1070
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:18,743
That puts you back in the race.

1071
01:32:21,105 --> 01:32:23,628
I'll need you to do
something for me too.

1072
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:27,151
I know.

1073
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:30,715
You'll have no trouble
with the police.

1074
01:32:30,915 --> 01:32:31,916
It's a promise.

1075
01:32:38,402 --> 01:32:39,724
Thank you.

1076
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:47,772
Just so you know...

1077
01:32:50,054 --> 01:32:51,736
...l do love her.

1078
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:39,263
You want me to walk you inside?

1079
01:34:01,806 --> 01:34:03,928
I dropped her off
at her brother's...

1080
01:34:04,328 --> 01:34:06,490
...a four-plex on Dinker Street.

1081
01:34:07,091 --> 01:34:09,293
She told me her story
on the way home...

1082
01:34:09,493 --> 01:34:11,656
... Iike a sinner
who wanted to confess.

1083
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:15,339
Her name was Ruby Hanks
from Lake Charles, Louisiana.

1084
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:19,303
I suppose all she really wanted
was a place to fit in.

1085
01:34:20,304 --> 01:34:23,027
A few days later,
my conscience got the best of me...

1086
01:34:23,307 --> 01:34:26,350
...and I went by her place
to bring back her money.

1087
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:29,513
I was kind of excited
about seeing her again.

1088
01:34:30,154 --> 01:34:31,676
But when I got there...

1089
01:34:32,156 --> 01:34:34,759
...she and her brother
had picked up and gone.

1090
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,162
Find a job yet?

1091
01:35:18,522 --> 01:35:20,364
I ain't studying no job, Odell.

1092
01:35:20,885 --> 01:35:22,767
No job? How you gonna live?

1093
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:26,330
I got a little money saved up.
I'll invest in real estate.

1094
01:35:26,651 --> 01:35:30,054
-Maybe go into business for myself.
-What kind of business?

1095
01:35:30,334 --> 01:35:32,296
Private investigating.

1096
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:34,458
You get in trouble doing that.

1097
01:35:34,699 --> 01:35:37,101
Well, like a man told me once:

1098
01:35:37,862 --> 01:35:40,665
"Step out your door,
you're already in trouble.

1099
01:35:40,905 --> 01:35:43,708
Only thing is, if you're mixed up
at the top or not."

1100
01:35:45,790 --> 01:35:47,351
I guess you're right.

1101
01:35:52,156 --> 01:35:56,641
If you got a friend that you know
does bad things, real bad things...

1102
01:35:57,281 --> 01:36:00,925
...and you still keep him as a friend,
knowing what he's like...

1103
01:36:02,647 --> 01:36:03,608
...is that wrong?

1104
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:08,212
All you got is your friends.

1105
01:36:11,535 --> 01:36:14,699
What are you doing?
You get out of my yard!

1106
01:36:15,139 --> 01:36:16,180
Get away!

1107
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:19,223
That fool knocked down
two of my trees. Get away!

1108
01:36:21,065 --> 01:36:22,346
Get on!

1109
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,391
You all right?

1110
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,282
I thought about what
he said about friends...

1111
01:37:18,522 --> 01:37:20,404
...and it made sense to me.

1112
01:37:20,645 --> 01:37:23,848
Odell goes to church every Sunday,
so he would know.

1113
01:37:24,528 --> 01:37:28,933
Later, he challenged me to dominoes.
Now, what he do that for?

1114
01:37:29,493 --> 01:37:32,617
We got to talking about Texas
and fooled around...

1115
01:37:32,897 --> 01:37:35,099
...and drunk a quart of whiskey.

1116
01:37:35,299 --> 01:37:39,704
And I forgot all about Daphne Monet,
DeWitt Albright, Carter and them.

1117
01:37:40,344 --> 01:37:42,266
And I sat with my friend...

1118
01:37:42,506 --> 01:37:44,228
... on my porch...

1119
01:37:44,749 --> 01:37:46,350
...at my house...

1120
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:49,553
...and we laughed a long time.
