3
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:23,667
Turn back!

4
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:28,417
Meltdown: Reactor 3.

5
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,042
Evacuate personnel.

6
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,833
Come on, come on, come on!

7
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,208
- We gotta go!
- Don't panic, I got this.

8
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,417
Look, you just push here.

9
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,167
And we're screwed.

10
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,000
Come on.

11
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,417
Push it!

12
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,500
It's jammed.

13
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,125
It's an old 2022 plant.

14
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,500
Some analog program
must reboot the system.

15
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:52,833
Hey look!

16
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,792
Shit.

17
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,042
Yellow or blue?

18
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,542
My instinct says blue.

19
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,167
- Why blue?
- It's reassuring.

20
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,875
It isn't, yellow is!
It's chicks, the sun, life.

21
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,500
Depends how you look at it.

22
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,375
Do not push the...

23
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,708
What's that?

24
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,625
This tramp appeared out of nowhere.

25
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:33,708
He's telling us something.

26
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,833
I can't hear you, sir.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,958
...could destroy the human race.

28
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,583
You're too far away.

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,375
What if I scream?

30
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:42,333
Ice cream?

31
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,208
Call him over.

32
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:44,875
Come help out.

33
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:45,750
Fuck!

34
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,917
Run, run, run!

35
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,125
Jeez, what a great start!

36
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,375
- Hear me now?
- That's better!

37
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:53,958
I was saying...
Don't push the blue button!

38
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:54,792
Why not?

39
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,500
You didn't hear a thing?

40
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,208
The plant will blow up!

41
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,042
Are you sure?

42
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,958
Yes! I'm from the future.

43
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:01,792
What did he say?

44
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,708
"Don't push blue,
I'm from the future."

45
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's quiz him to see
if he's telling the truth.

46
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,333
We don't have time.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,542
- OK, we believe you.
- Cool. I have a job usually.

48
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,958
So we push yellow?

49
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,208
Read the instructions.

50
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,792
It's all Chinese to us.

51
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,375
Aren't you engineers?

52
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,792
Yes, but it's in Chinese!

53
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,083
Show him.

54
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,250
I'll be back.

55
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,625
He vanished as if by magic.

56
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,458
And he's back with a guy.

57
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,750
This is Mr. Wong.

58
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,667
Show him the card.

59
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,083
What's that?

60
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,250
Speak into this.

61
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,583
Machine translation.

62
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,292
That thing is in Cantonese.
I speak Mandarin.

63
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll be back.

64
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,583
We're going to die.

65
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,792
We can trust him,
he's from the future.

66
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,458
Remember me?

67
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,042
I saw you a second ago.

68
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,708
A second for you!
I spent six months learning Mandarin.

69
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,833
Cantonese.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,250
I'll be back.

71
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,292
Yep, we're going to die.

72
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,333
- Done!
- Learnt Cantonese?

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,250
I went into the past
and spoke to the plant's designer.

74
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,167
And?

75
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,917
It's the yellow button.

76
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,750
- Sure?
- Go on!

77
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,542
Shit!

78
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,792
Time Patrol.
You're under arrest!

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,042
Hurry up!

80
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,833
Two guys are here,
the tramp's vanished.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,833
I'm lost.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,917
Yellow button?

83
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,833
No, don't!

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,917
The blue will blow us sky high.

85
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,208
Ignore the tramp. It's a trap!

86
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,417
The guy's a terrorist.

87
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,542
The Time Patrol is here to help!

88
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,625
What were you planning to do?

89
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:16,042
We wanted - well, I did -
to push the blue button.

90
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,083
There you go!
Blue is reassuring.

91
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,292
Reassuring!
That's just what I said.

92
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:22,250
Great!

93
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,667
- So I push it?
- Not yet!

94
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,083
Why?

95
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,250
Wait till we've gone, OK?

96
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,083
That's weird.

97
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,208
It's the protocol.

98
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,542
What are we waiting for exactly?

99
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,583
A clear signal from us. Just wait.

100
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,500
Wait, OK?

101
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,750
OK, hit the blue button.

102
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,125
Great, guys!

103
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,917
Overload imminent!

104
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,292
Awesome!

105
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:43,583
THE VISITOR FROM THE FUTURE

106
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:48,833
Axomako cloud crosses
Paris area for fifth time

107
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,708
Explosion of Axomako's
historic nuclear power plant

108
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,375
Numerous victims.
Who is to blame?

109
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,708
Deputy Alibert greenlights
Axomako nuclear plant

110
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:19,375
Right, I think I've covered everything.
Any questions?

111
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,875
Thank you, Mr. Alibert.

112
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,542
Will the plant benefit the region?

113
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,625
It will have significant benefits.

114
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,708
It will provide employment.

115
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,333
Remember that nuclear is
the best clean energy source.

116
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,042
So if there's global warming,
it won't be our fault!

117
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:40,958
Sir?

118
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,292
What is your relationship with Axamako?

119
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,875
I like Axomako.
They make good plants.

120
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,917
They have proved that in China

121
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,625
and will soon do so here.

122
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:52,542
Any more questions? Don't be shy.

123
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,167
Go ahead.

124
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Mr. Alibert!

125
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,958
Why does Axomako use obsolete
technology in its new plants?

126
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,333
The technology is not obsolete,
and you're not a journalist.

127
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,625
How did you get in?

128
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,750
In 70 years' time,
the technology will be 100 years old.

129
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,875
It's a huge risk, isn't it?

130
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,833
I disagree.

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
It's not a risk.

132
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,875
Over the next 100 years,
we'll find solutions.

133
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,417
Life will be good.

134
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,125
And we'll go to the bakery by jetpack!

135
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,125
That'll be so cool!

136
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,083
Mr. Alibert!

137
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,583
Do you care about the planet?

138
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:40,750
Young lady,

139
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,500
I care about my region,
and my region is on the planet...

140
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,083
so I care about my planet.

141
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,417
Thank you.

142
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,333
Have a good afternoon.

143
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,875
Film me.

144
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,375
Don't touch her!

145
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:55,583
Sit down!

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,167
- Did you get that?
- Do it again.

147
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,208
I said to leave her alone!

148
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,083
Goodbye.

149
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,583
Charlie, stop!

150
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,417
Stop that!

151
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,208
I'm gonna smash your face in!

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,958
The bastard's pulling my hair!

153
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,292
Film him!

154
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,167
Good job, guys!

155
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,375
It wasn't that bad.
Lucien filmed the whole thing.

156
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,667
They took his camera.

157
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,625
Yeah, but I removed the SD card

158
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,875
and shoved it up my ass!

159
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,667
- You're a genius.
- Sure am!

160
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,917
I don't want to post it.
Getting arrested wasn't the plan.

161
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,750
You can't be serious!
Everyone will talk about us.

162
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,875
I want them to talk about the plant.

163
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,250
Only the message counts.

164
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:47,000
A message needs a face.
Otherwise we won't be heard.

165
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,125
- Charlie's too ugly.
- Gratuitous!

166
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:52,083
I do the filming, so I can't.
That leaves you.

167
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,250
What's the plan?

168
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,083
The best is for you to go to jail.

169
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,375
Perfect!

170
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,500
What?

171
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,750
Hunger strikes are effective too.
Just go on hunger strike.

172
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,167
What will you do?

173
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,875
Launch a hashtag campaign.
You know, #FreeAlice

174
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,333
or #SaveAlice.
I can't decide which.

175
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,667
I get the short straw, huh?

176
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,667
He stuck an SD card up his ass.

177
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,917
64GB it was too!

178
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,208
I refuse to be your spokesperson,
martyr or whatever.

179
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,625
I'll fight for the cause,
but I'm nobody.

180
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,750
What a pain.

181
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,000
Your father's here.

182
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,708
Come on, let's go.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,583
- You drink too much.
- That's why I have a driver.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,792
- Shall I drop Alice home?
- My place, Fabio.

185
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,292
You can sleep in your old room.

186
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:18,875
If you say so.

187
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:24,125
Interesting friends you have.

188
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:25,708
They're not my friends.

189
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,833
I met them on a forum.

190
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,750
Internet!

191
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,083
Don't believe everything you read.

192
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,542
Give me a break.

193
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,958
Everybody knows
Axomako builds shoddy plants.

194
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,375
They're hiring you when your term's up.

195
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,042
It's classic, it's called...

196
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,667
A "revolting" door.

197
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,500
That's it.

198
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,000
How about some music?

199
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,375
Look, Alice,

200
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,875
I'm concerned about your future.

201
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,375
- I'm doing fine.
- With whose money?

202
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,167
The rebel lets me pay her rent!

203
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,000
What would your internet pals say?

204
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,167
I love this track.
Listen to that bass.

205
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,208
Turn that crap off!

206
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:11,875
Right away, sir.

207
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,167
Well done for getting yourself noticed!

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,083
I don't do it for that.

209
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,958
I know, I know, it's for the planet.

210
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,542
I'm not an idiot.
I care about these things too.

211
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,542
Your mother was just like you.

212
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,042
Totally committed.

213
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,125
She didn't change you!

214
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,125
She didn't have time, as you know.

215
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,167
What does that mean?

216
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,125
Nothing.

217
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,625
Go on, say it.

218
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,250
Say what?

219
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,000
Stop the sly comments about Mom!

220
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,250
You do it all the time!

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,458
Drop me here, Fabio.

222
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,167
All right.

223
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,792
Shit.

224
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,250
Home, Fabio.

225
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,042
And without music.

226
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,417
Hello?

227
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,875
So that's why you had secret info!

228
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,167
You're his daughter.

229
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,417
Keep it to yourselves.

230
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,417
And don't post the video.
I'm nobody.

231
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,542
Who are you?
A little daddy's girl

232
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,583
who's bored and wants fun?
It's just a hobby for you!

233
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,000
I want him to realize
what he's doing is wrong.

234
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,375
- And does he?
- I guess not.

235
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,958
Look, Alice, either commit 100%

236
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,583
or stay in your bubble!

237
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,125
I am committed,
but I don't know what to do.

238
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,333
We have to catch him out!

239
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,625
Prove Axomako is hiring him
when his term's up.

240
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,292
It'll be a mega political scandal!

241
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,708
Great! How do I do that?

242
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,250
You swipe his computer.

243
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,042
No way! I can't.

244
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,083
Alice, don't be a pain!
Think of others for once.

245
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,250
We're doing this for the planet!

246
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,208
If you refuse,

247
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,667
we'll post the video
and tell everyone he's your dad.

248
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,542
Shove the video up your ass!

249
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,208
I already have, Alice.

250
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,542
Right.

251
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,292
OK.

252
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,917
ECOLOGY OR DEATH

253
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,625
Hi honey!

254
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,833
How nice to be in your workshop!

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,583
Show us what you're doing.

256
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,667
I'm almost done.

257
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,458
- Ice what?
- It's my favorite.

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,792
"Ice Caps, the Final Meltdown!"

259
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,583
Watch out for the riot squad,
you and your bump.

260
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,125
They won't charge us!

261
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,083
Right, OK.

262
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,083
You're laughing. Look.

263
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,500
You're so beautiful.

264
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:21,750
I love that look.

265
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:22,875
- I love you.
- You do?

266
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:23,958
Of course I do!

267
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,208
Me too.

268
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,042
Who are you?

269
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,625
You first!

270
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,000
- Me?
- Yes.

271
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,792
I'm nobody.

272
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,167
OK. Great mood here!

273
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,125
Right, listen up.

274
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,292
This is very important.

275
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,500
My name's...

276
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,042
What the hell's going on?

277
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,875
- Alice?
- Dad.

278
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,583
Who's that tramp?

279
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,083
No idea.
He was here when I came in.

280
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,750
He was after your computer.

281
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:57,917
Why are you here?

282
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,417
To make up with me?

283
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,000
That's right.

284
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:06,667
Sorry, I thought you'd come
to steal my computer too.

285
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,750
- Are you nuts?
- Robbed by my own daughter!

286
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,208
Well, did you?

287
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,458
Yes.

288
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,542
But I knocked him out.

289
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,333
- Your accomplice?
- I don't know the guy.

290
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,458
- I'm calling the police.
- Good idea.

291
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,750
Wait!
What are you going to say?

292
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,875
- Time Patrol.
- Don't be surprised!

293
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,417
What the hell's that?

294
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,333
Where are they?

295
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,292
- I can't see them!
- Wrong way, Victor.

296
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,000
There they are.

297
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,000
- I've got him.
- He isn't armed.

298
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,167
So what?

299
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,333
Right, listen to me.

300
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,750
I'm from the future.

301
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,792
If Gilbert builds his plant,
here's what's gonna happen.

302
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,417
I'm taking him out.

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,708
Fuck!

304
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,167
You idiot!

305
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,292
He's mine.

306
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:38,875
Dad!

307
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, well if he moves...

308
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,417
Fuck, it hurts!

309
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,833
Get off me, you!

310
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,333
Don't touch my dad.

311
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,792
He's taking the target!

312
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:57,292
Hurry!

313
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:01,208
Freeze!

314
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
Goddamn it!

315
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,167
The boss will be super pissed off.

316
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm ratting you guys out.

317
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,542
Drink o'clock!

318
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,417
- Dad!
- All right, Alice?

319
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,458
Get off me!

320
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,292
Leave me alone!

321
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,417
Get off me!

322
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,250
Why bring him here?
Who's that?

323
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:41,625
Nobody.

324
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,875
Deal with her,
I'll deal with the dad.

325
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,792
Hey there!

326
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,625
There's no need to worry.

327
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,125
- Come back!
- Run, Alice.

328
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,208
Run!

329
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,875
What is this?

330
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,583
Trapdoor Room opening.

331
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,083
What's that?

332
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,875
How did it go?

333
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,792
Louise messed up.
She missed her target.

334
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,917
I did not.

335
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,292
I got one.

336
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,292
- In the leg.
- Attaboy!

337
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:17,500
Unfortunately it was the guy
we were supposed to protect.

338
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,750
They got away.

339
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,417
They're so smart.

340
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,958
No, they're not!
They're less lame than us.

341
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,042
Than you.

342
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,250
- She's mad she messed up.
- Typical!

343
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,583
I did not mess up.

344
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,792
Let's see what the boss says.

345
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:36,708
Is she pissed off?

346
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,792
I'm not pissed off.

347
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm confused.

348
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,708
In a nutshell,

349
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,500
Louise tried to shoot the troublemaker

350
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,125
but Matteo stopped her.

351
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:49,292
Then Victor shot at them.

352
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,875
He missed and hit Gilbert Alibert,
who was kidnapped

353
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,542
around the year 2555.

354
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,208
Thank you, Richard.

355
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,750
I would like to point out
it was mainly Matteo's fault.

356
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:02,750
Thank you, Richard.

357
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,917
Victor should not have been
on the mission.

358
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,250
He's a danger to himself and others.

359
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,375
Thanks again.

360
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,125
Matteo, how do you explain your actions?

361
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:15,250
Our mission is not
to shoot suspects on sight.

362
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:19,042
He is the worst criminal
our patrol has ever dealt with.

363
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,417
He and his accomplices
are our priority.

364
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,667
See that, Constance?
I put his face on the big screen.

365
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,917
The madman thinks
he's saving the world!

366
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,125
He could destroy
the space-time continuum.

367
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,625
You know what that means?

368
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,292
Course I do.
I know all that stuff.

369
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,792
Louise is replacing you
as mission leader.

370
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,958
Sorry?

371
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,167
Awesome.
I mean, affirmative.

372
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,917
Matteo, you can't leave a briefing!

373
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,417
Let him go, Richard.

374
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,958
Can I leave too?

375
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,125
Louise,

376
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,333
I want you to find Gilbert Alibert

377
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,458
and eliminate potential enemies.

378
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,208
Tough job.
I mean, you bet!

379
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,792
I mean, affirmative.

380
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,083
Don't make me regret my decision.

381
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:07,833
Constance,

382
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:09,500
there's something else.

383
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,792
Gilbert Alibert
wasn't the only one kidnapped.

384
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,833
Alice, are you awake?

385
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,583
Dad?

386
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,292
- Where are you?
- Here!

387
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:44,958
You OK?

388
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,750
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

389
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,625
It's desolate out there.
Belgium maybe?

390
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,000
It isn't Belgium, it's Paris.

391
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,083
Only different.

392
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,667
We have to get out of here!

393
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,208
They're terrorists.
Negotiate with them.

394
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,500
Why me?

395
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,875
Because hippies are your department.

396
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,625
Is your leg OK?

397
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,375
Yes, fine.

398
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:11,417
They tried to patch it up.
It's a botch job.

399
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:13,958
Their hands were filthy.
I bet I have tetanus.

400
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,417
- Someone's coming.
- Beat them up!

401
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,167
That's easy for you to say.

402
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:24,333
Hey there.
We can hear everything by the way.

403
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:29,333
I fixed you this.

404
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,458
Enjoy!

405
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,000
That's food?

406
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,792
Born complainer, huh?

407
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,667
Of course it's food.
The best you can get here.

408
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,750
Move outside your 21st-century
hipster comfort zone.

409
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,750
This is the future.

410
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:52,208
You can forget your brunches.

411
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,917
This is brunch now.

412
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,125
What was that?

413
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:56,333
Where are we?

414
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:57,833
In the future.

415
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,792
What are you on about?

416
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,500
It's awful outside.

417
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,167
That's why we don't go.

418
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,917
But don't worry,
I brought my consoles with me.

419
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:11,083
Want to play FIFA?

420
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,958
It's a nice idea

421
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,500
but I don't plan
to stay long in this prison.

422
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,583
You have to take us home.

423
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,667
We'll see.
Only this isn't a prison,

424
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,167
it's my bedroom.

425
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,625
- You live here?
- Yeah.

426
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:31,917
I used to be like you.
I came from the "present"

427
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:34,125
then I met this guy.

428
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:37,875
I traveled in time
and it changed my life forever.

429
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:39,167
What did you do before?

430
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,958
I just played video games.

431
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,167
And now?

432
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,542
So if this isn't a prison,

433
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:49,750
can we leave?

434
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,417
Ask the others.
I don't get to decide.

435
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,667
I'm number three in the hierarchy.

436
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,500
Out of three.

437
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,250
You can discuss it in the lab.

438
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,125
Come on.

439
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,333
I want out too!

440
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,042
Hello, Alice.

441
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:27,250
Remember me?
You tried to beat me up.

442
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:28,417
Several times.

443
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,208
- Do you have a name?
- Sure.

444
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,250
But I didn't get the chance to tell you.

445
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,375
OK, so my name...

446
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,833
People are looking for us.

447
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,083
I advise you to let us go!

448
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,250
You want to leave already?

449
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,125
The door's there.

450
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,292
Really?

451
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,208
Right.

452
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,583
Alice, follow me.

453
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:04,250
Excuse me.

454
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,625
The button on the side.

455
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:07,333
I thought so.

456
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,125
Thanks!

457
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,458
Didn't anyone tell you?

458
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,500
The future is full of zombies.

459
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:24,875
Why?

460
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,583
Excellent question!

461
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,875
Hello, I'm Dr. Henry Castafolte.

462
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,792
How did the undead,
commonly known as zombies,

463
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,708
appear on our planet?

464
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:43,000
First we must distinguish them
from the infected,

465
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,375
very commonly known
as running zombies.

466
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:48,208
Why running zombies?

467
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,083
- Because they run.
- Correct!

468
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,167
The zombies you saw are undead.

469
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,333
They are walking zombies.

470
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,333
- Because they walk.
- Did I ask you, Raph?

471
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,292
You interrupted me.

472
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,750
How rude!
Put that biscuit down.

473
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,500
Do it.

474
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,292
Why are they zombies?

475
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,833
Radiation.

476
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,292
Is that all?

477
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:17,375
The real question is,
why the radiation, Gilbert?

478
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,458
I was right.

479
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,208
Your plant will explode, Dad.

480
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,500
It isn't mine, it's Axomako's.

481
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,458
I'm not to blame for all the disasters!

482
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:44,333
He's right.

483
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,917
Many nuclear disasters
were caused by earthquakes.

484
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:48,208
And the Cat War.

485
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:49,500
The what?

486
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:51,292
I didn't cause all the radiation.

487
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,500
Where we're from,

488
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,167
nuclear is the lesser evil.

489
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,542
You'd rather I built a coal plant?

490
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,750
That isn't the problem.

491
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:01,333
I simply tried to optimize the budget

492
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,125
in a highly competitive market.

493
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,750
All safety standards were met.

494
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,375
I'm not to blame
if it wasn't renovated.

495
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:10,167
It's never your fault.
That's the problem!

496
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:13,458
You bequeath your risky ventures
to future generations

497
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,042
and hope we'll magically fix things!

498
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,417
Spoiler alert: We have no powers.

499
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,333
We don't even have toilets,
we crap in buckets!

500
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,292
That's the future.

501
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,750
The future?

502
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,708
How we do know this is the future?

503
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,708
Where are your jetpacks?

504
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,500
What are you up to?

505
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,292
We're going out.

506
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,583
Hang on, what about the zombies?

507
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,458
What zombies?

508
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:12,750
Wait!

509
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,458
He's super ugly.

510
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,042
- That's me, Mom.
- So it is!

511
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,542
- What's that?
- Where are we?

512
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,583
It's come even closer.

513
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,042
Get out.

514
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,875
Gilbert, we'll keep it simple.

515
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:01,667
If you build your plant,
here's what's gonna happen!

516
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,417
What's that?

517
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:16,667
It's what happens
when you optimize your budget

518
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,083
in a competitive market.

519
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:23,500
The blast cloud drifted
across the Atlantic.

520
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,042
Everybody figured
it'd be America's problem.

521
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,083
They'd forgotten something.

522
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,042
What?

523
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,750
The Earth is round.

524
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:34,542
That's dumb.

525
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,208
Every 70 years
the cloud circles the globe

526
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,958
and kills 50% of the population.

527
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,375
It's bigger every time.

528
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,375
- It's really big.
- It sure is.

529
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,833
No one will survive this time.

530
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,875
Do you understand
the problem now, Gilbert?

531
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,875
Yes, it's perfectly clear.

532
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:00,583
Great! That suits me.

533
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,958
Stop! Are you insane?

534
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,333
- He said he understood.
- Right.

535
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,625
Don't kill him!

536
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,458
It's to save the human race.

537
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:13,375
Isn't there another solution?

538
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,417
There was!

539
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:18,167
I tried to steal his computer,
to create a scandal.

540
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,833
But someone stopped me.

541
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,625
I wasn't to know.
It was my idea too!

542
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:23,958
I don't feel good.

543
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:27,917
In your present,
the Time Patrol will find you

544
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,792
and keep you
on the Tracks of Time.

545
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:30,958
Sorry, Gilbert.

546
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:34,792
Don't, don't... Dad?

547
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:36,750
Dad!

548
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:37,875
Dad, wake up.

549
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:42,667
- I can't kill an unconscious man.
- Hardly sporting.

550
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,875
I've got an idea.

551
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,500
The adults are talking!

552
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,292
For the Time Patrol
not to notice a time change,

553
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,167
it has to be an internal change.

554
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,375
It's astonishing but he's right.

555
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,542
If an individual undergoes
psychological change,

556
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:02,375
if they experience an epiphany,

557
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,708
they can change the course of Time

558
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,958
and the patrol can't stop them.

559
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,792
Please.

560
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,500
I'm sure he can change.

561
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,500
I'm not.
There's no time anyway.

562
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,208
He wasn't always like this.

563
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,417
If the patrol finds us,
I'll take action.

564
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,000
- Is that clear?
- I understand.

565
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,542
I'm not so sure.

566
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:42,875
Let's get back.

567
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,750
Dad! It's OK...

568
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,208
Let me help you.

569
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,292
Thanks, Raph.

570
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,917
No, well, er...

571
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:54,250
We'll do the thing.

572
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:55,292
What?

573
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:58,792
What I mean is,
I think we can change your dad.

574
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,667
If the Time Patrol
doesn't catch us first.

575
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,583
Hey, you!

576
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,583
So... it's shoot-on-sight now?

577
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,083
We've no time for diplomacy.
Constance is counting on us.

578
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,792
Ass licker!

579
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,958
- Who are you?
- The Time Patrol.

580
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,208
Do you know them?

581
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,125
Yes, I do.
But why shoot me?

582
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,750
You simply had to ask.

583
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,583
Sorry.
Do you know where they are?

584
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,667
Yes, but I'm not telling you now.

585
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,458
You've upset me.

586
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,458
Good job, Louise!

587
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,625
Look, tell us where they are
then we'll tend to you.

588
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,375
No.

589
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:14,875
Treat me first.

590
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:18,375
If he refuses to tell us,
we shoot his other leg.

591
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:23,125
Their lab is in the East Maze.
That way, left,

592
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,333
strong door with a fox on it.

593
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,708
There you go!

594
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,500
You simply had to ask.

595
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:30,958
There we go!

596
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,542
Richard says I'm dangerous but...

597
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,083
East Maze?
He said the East Maze.

598
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,667
So it has to be east.

599
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,292
Right, this way.

600
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,875
It's gonna be a long day.

601
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,667
Who's up for a drink?

602
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:58,750
A cold one?

603
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,083
Seriously?

604
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:02,208
Are we buddies or hostages?

605
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,250
You almost shot my dad.

606
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,708
Saving the world isn't that simple.

607
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,958
Yeah, I know.

608
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,917
We're fighting the same fight.

609
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,792
With different methods!

610
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,667
That's right.
You're an amateur, we're pros.

611
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:20,833
If we're pros, pay me.

612
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,583
You are paid, Raph.

613
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,583
Where's the money?

614
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,958
It pays for your room.

615
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,333
Think I'd put you up for free?

616
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,542
What I mean is, Alice,

617
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,792
we don't really kill people.
We never have.

618
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:37,458
Or if we have, it wasn't for pleasure.

619
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:40,917
Do zombies count?
I get a kick out of killing them.

620
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,458
Zombies don't count.

621
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,500
Don't be so zombie-phobic.

622
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:45,750
Give us a break!

623
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,167
- What's the plan?
- Right now?

624
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,625
To have a drink.
Our bar does great gnat's pee!

625
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:52,750
Seriously.

626
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,917
For my dad.

627
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,500
Any ideas?

628
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,458
Crossed wires, Alice.
You said you had an idea.

629
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,000
No, I did not.

630
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:02,708
I said he could change.

631
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,167
When Mom was still around,

632
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,208
she could change his mind.

633
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,333
Or so he says.

634
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,125
I never knew her.

635
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:13,500
Why?

636
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,375
Did your mom...?

637
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,542
In labor.

638
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,542
Mr. Alibert?

639
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,583
Your child is fine.

640
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:49,833
But there were complications.

641
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,833
Your wife hemorrhaged.

642
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,375
She died.

643
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,042
I bet he wished
they'd saved Mom instead.

644
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,458
We could...

645
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,833
We're not bringing
your mom back to life.

646
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:12,875
Why not?

647
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:14,333
It's too risky.

648
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,083
If we save your mom
and cancel the baby you,

649
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,583
it'll create a paradox.

650
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,458
- What?
- A paradoxical thing! Forget it.

651
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,708
- Thanks a lot!
- What he means is,

652
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,708
you'd exist without existing.

653
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,375
You would be an aberration.

654
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:32,833
Don't worry, Alice,
I don't get this time stuff either.

655
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,500
Your dad doesn't realize
who the victims of his acts will be.

656
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,792
There's us for starters.

657
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,333
He doesn't care about you.

658
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,583
He has to see real people.

659
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,750
Civilians in distress, children...

660
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,000
- That'd be great!
- Let's go the Lair.

661
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,500
Raph, shut it!

662
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:50,083
What's the Lair?

663
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,333
Nothing.

664
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,208
I have a better idea.

665
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,625
Damn, that's good!

666
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:00,917
Good job!

667
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:02,875
Great.

668
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,417
- Hey, don't cheat!
- Chill.

669
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,375
What'll it be?

670
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,375
- What whisky do you have?
- We'll have water.

671
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,875
Water? Tap water?

672
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,667
Are you the Queen of Neo Versailles?

673
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,333
Fucking hell!

674
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,542
Drop it, Francis.
They'll have the same.

675
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,125
For the Queen!

676
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,417
What do you do?

677
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:50,208
I trade in bulk.

678
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,083
Ah, a trader!
What do you sell?

679
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,375
I just told you: bulk!

680
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Do you have family?

681
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,167
Yes. There's Didier,

682
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,792
my father, my brother, my uncle...

683
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,042
Let me guess,
he's one and the same.

684
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,417
Yep.

685
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:11,667
Do you have kids?

686
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,458
Want mine?
They're going cheap.

687
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,667
Boris, you promised them to me!

688
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:19,208
You ate the last one I gave you.

689
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,000
Yes, but I paid for it!

690
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,458
Come on, let's go.

691
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:25,333
Henry says he's working,
but I think...

692
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,958
- he's jerking off.
- For sure.

693
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,625
Is it safe to leave them alone?

694
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:31,167
It's OK, Raph,
I'm keeping an eye on them.

695
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,000
- Two for one!
- No thank you.

696
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:35,708
At the very worst, Gilbert will die.

697
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,417
Yes, but Alice is innocent.

698
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,958
I'm not worried about her.
She's a fast learner.

699
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,750
I'm thinking of hiring her.

700
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,375
She'll never agree.

701
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,292
She's into saving the world.

702
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,125
Maybe she'd like to go pro.

703
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,542
I didn't think they'd be so weird.

704
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:54,958
Don't worry,
your plan is very smart.

705
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,792
It is? Thanks.

706
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,667
Buying time
so the Time Patrol finds us!

707
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,167
That isn't the plan.

708
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:02,667
I want you to change.

709
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,292
Come on, Alice,
no one changes at 40!

710
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,625
It says so on Facebook.

711
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,333
But the cloud will kill them all.

712
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,417
How awful!
Rėgis won't get to eat Boris's kids.

713
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:15,500
There'll be other victims too.

714
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:18,583
I don't give a damn about them!
I only care about you.

715
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,667
Me?

716
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,375
You don't even know me.

717
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:22,792
But I'm your father!

718
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:25,167
OK. What's my favorite series?

719
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,250
Oh, come on, that's easy. It's...

720
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,917
Franklin the Turtle.

721
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,458
When I was 5, Dad!

722
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,250
You're obsessed with your career!

723
00:43:33,417 --> 00:43:35,708
I know I've been working 24/7.

724
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:38,292
But as a father,
I have to secure our future.

725
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:40,833
If you cared about the future,
we wouldn't be here!

726
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,417
What can I say?

727
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:44,958
The party's screwed
and I'm done for.

728
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:48,667
Axomako plans to hire me.
We'll be rolling in it.

729
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,958
- You will be!
- Who funds you?

730
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,625
- I can fend for myself.
- Sure!

731
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:57,292
You can't even hold down a job.

732
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:58,958
Pay your rent if you're a rebel.

733
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:01,333
Or join your pals from the future!

734
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,708
I'd like to, but I can't.
The cloud's going to kill them.

735
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,542
What did she say?

736
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,833
- Be quiet.
- Lost your nerve?

737
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,625
They don't need to know.

738
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,333
Listen up, guys!

739
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,042
I've got some terrible news.

740
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,208
- You're all going to die.
- What?

741
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,458
Smothered by a huge toxic cloud.

742
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:26,583
He's to blame.
His name's Gilbert.

743
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,042
Down with Gilbert!

744
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,750
Listen to me.

745
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:35,708
Calm down, my friends.

746
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,250
The drinks are on me!

747
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:45,500
Nice try. Let's go!

748
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,333
They're getting away!

749
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:53,750
Who's paying?

750
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:57,500
- Where to now?
- Who cares! The patrol will find us.

751
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,083
Put it on my tab.

752
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,833
Don't take me for an idiot!

753
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,208
I'm hard at work.

754
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,042
I'm busy...

755
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,750
I want to see hairless babes!

756
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:06,250
Victor.

757
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:07,750
The explosives.

758
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:47,333
10,

759
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:48,917
9...

760
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
5,

761
00:46:57,417 --> 00:46:58,458
4...

762
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,708
I can hear numbers.

763
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:04,583
Only backwards.

764
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,083
Get down!

765
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,917
Come on!

766
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,000
It's hot, hotta chocolatta!

767
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:39,875
You OK, guys?

768
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:41,625
Yeah, fine.

769
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:42,833
Victor?

770
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,667
A countdown.

771
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,417
That's what those numbers were.

772
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:02,917
Come on!

773
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:04,958
Push harder!

774
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,625
Come on.

775
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,375
The surface isn't the safest place.

776
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:21,000
If only we had jetpacks.
The future's such a let-down.

777
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:22,708
Why the obsession with jetpacks?

778
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,458
Why the non-obsession?

779
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,750
Everyone wants one to go to the bakery!

780
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,875
A future without jetpacks
isn't worth saving.

781
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,458
Let's go.

782
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,292
This isn't at all scary!

783
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:51,625
- Hello.
- Fuck!

784
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:53,500
What's that?

785
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,458
Why are you alone?

786
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:58,500
I'm not alone, you're here.

787
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,500
What's your name?

788
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:03,083
I'm Mouse.
Are you Fox's friends?

789
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,375
Who?

790
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,333
Weasel said not to talk to anyone

791
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,667
except Fox's friends.

792
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:10,417
Who are Weasel and Fox?

793
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:13,875
Weasel looks after us.
She and Fox are sweethearts.

794
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:17,625
They don't show it,
but I've seen them kissing.

795
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,083
See you!
The zombies are coming.

796
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:20,917
Wait!

797
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,750
Come back, you little coypu!

798
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,875
OK, Alice...
On the count of 3, we run.

799
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,083
1, 2...

800
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:41,500
Alice, wait!

801
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,500
Wait!

802
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:44,958
Wait for me!

803
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,417
Oh shit!

804
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:58,667
They don't walk, they trot!

805
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,333
Your plan sucks, Dad.

806
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,333
Sorry, I did my best.

807
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:16,875
Thank you.

808
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:19,667
Thank Raph.
I wanted to abandon you.

809
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:20,542
Thanks, Raph.

810
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,083
No, well, er...

811
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,667
Best to avoid death.

812
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,500
- What?
- We gotta go. They're coming for us.

813
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:29,125
Hold on to me.

814
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,042
I'll teleport us to a safe place.

815
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:36,750
- What's that?
- You forgot to charge it.

816
00:50:36,917 --> 00:50:39,667
It doesn't need charging,
it's solar-powered!

817
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,875
Well, it's night-time!

818
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,000
- Let's sacrifice Gilbert.
- No, you.

819
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:50,750
- I agree.
- I don't want anyone to die.

820
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:10,542
Fox, over here!

821
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:11,750
Weasel.

822
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,208
Come on, let's go!

823
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,208
Follow us, you zombies!

824
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,208
Come eat us, you losers!

825
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,083
Let's get out of here!

826
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,500
- Hurry!
- Wait for us!

827
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,250
Who's Fox?

828
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:31,500
I'm Fox!

829
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:33,000
No one ever listens!

830
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,333
Holy cow!

831
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:58,958
Matteo.

832
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:02,333
Go report to Constance on our progress.

833
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,625
And get myself killed?

834
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:08,875
Hi, guys!

835
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,500
Constance wants a progress report.

836
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:14,292
Richard, you can tell her

837
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:17,250
we've had a minor setback, an explosion.

838
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:19,917
No, don't.

839
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,125
Tell her we have a lead.

840
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,458
But be vague, OK?

841
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,958
You're on speaker.
She heard everything.

842
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,167
In your face!

843
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:33,458
- Is she pissed off?
- You're still on speaker!

844
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,208
Tell her I promise we'll find them.

845
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,125
Guys, move your asses!
We need clues.

846
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:46,083
Victor, put that down!

847
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:50,167
The way things are going,
I'll be mission leader tonight!

848
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,958
LAIR

849
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,750
LAIR

850
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:10,250
Out the way!

851
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:13,083
Welcome to the Lair.

852
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,167
Fox!

853
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,375
How are you?

854
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,458
1, 2, 3!

855
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,667
1, 2, 3!

856
00:53:39,667 --> 00:53:40,625
Come on.

857
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:45,792
Keep still.

858
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,625
Thank you.

859
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:57,708
You're welcome.

860
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:00,583
Hey, that's enough!

861
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,500
I wanted to thank you again.

862
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:13,250
No, well, er...

863
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,875
No need.
You're part of the team now.

864
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,208
Part of what?

865
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:21,083
The team.

866
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,250
You're one of us.
Well, if you want to be.

867
00:54:24,417 --> 00:54:26,708
You'd accept a 21st-century hipster?

868
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,875
We already have a robot, so...

869
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,667
You have a robot?

870
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,833
What do you mean, a robot?

871
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,500
Never mind.

872
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,917
Forget it.

873
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,292
I didn't want them to come.

874
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,208
They seem harmless enough.

875
00:54:58,875 --> 00:54:59,917
That guy though...

876
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:02,833
he's a real menace.

877
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,333
Can't you see it's clean?

878
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,917
Are you dumb?

879
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:11,458
I don't know what to do with him.

880
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:12,917
You don't have to kill him.

881
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,667
To save you, maybe.

882
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:17,750
You can't save everyone.

883
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,000
I can too.

884
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:24,750
For now, we saved you.

885
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,667
Yeah.

886
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,167
Enjoy!

887
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,417
Hey, elbows on the table!

888
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:49,750
That's better.

889
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,958
It's tiring, going every day.

890
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:06,042
This looks tasty. What is it?

891
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:07,917
R.O.U.S.

892
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,417
R.O.U.S.? OK.

893
00:56:10,708 --> 00:56:12,625
What's R.O.U.S.?

894
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,333
Forget it, I'd rather not know.

895
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,917
Good thinking.
Enjoy your meal, Gilbert.

896
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,583
R.O.U.S. is rat, giant rat.

897
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:25,542
Great!

898
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,667
- What did I say?
- Quiet.

899
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:42,583
Henry?

900
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:46,833
The Time Patrol is coming!

901
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:50,333
Time Patrol! Freeze!

902
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,458
Pack, into position!

903
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,417
Do we shoot or not?

904
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:06,083
Give me a rock!

905
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:08,542
Pass them on!

906
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:11,292
We stay here.

907
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:12,708
Louise?

908
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:14,542
Fire!

909
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,875
Fuck!

910
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,292
What now, chief?

911
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,125
Get out of the Lair!

912
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:24,708
Get lost!

913
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,708
I don't know, they're kids!

914
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,542
All together now!

915
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,500
Yeah, armed kids!

916
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:31,792
Fuck the Time Patrol!

917
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,583
Little bastards.

918
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:38,792
You know what?

919
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:41,375
Take that, Lost Boys!

920
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:42,292
No, Victor!

921
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,042
Take cover!

922
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:54,583
Henry!

923
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,292
This is all your fault!

924
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,958
I know.

925
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,000
Dad!

926
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:08,958
Don't... Don't do it!

927
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:12,333
Don't! Stop!

928
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:50,708
Pack,

929
00:59:50,875 --> 00:59:52,625
lay down your arms.
We surrender.

930
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:07,667
No.

931
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,125
Don't be...

932
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,125
We're not after you.

933
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:15,708
All right?

934
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:30,542
You're safe.

935
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:32,917
It's going to be all right.

936
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,500
I wanted to thank you.

937
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:53,750
You helped us catch
a notorious criminal.

938
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,458
What's criminal about trying
to prevent disasters?

939
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:00,500
You think he's a hero?

940
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:01,875
You're mistaken.

941
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:05,417
Every "good deed" of his
causes collateral damage.

942
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,375
The madman thinks
he's saving the world.

943
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:12,500
Do you motivate your RoboCops
with that little spiel?

944
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,583
Well it won't work on me.

945
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,667
You claim to protect Time.

946
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:19,417
But you want everything
to stay as it is.

947
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,667
Because it suits you.

948
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:23,667
Because things could be worse.

949
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,958
- Than the end of the world?
- Everything ends.

950
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,125
Even the world.

951
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:31,917
No need to time travel
to save the planet.

952
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:34,708
- I'll stop Dad building the plant.
- You will not.

953
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,875
Why? Are you going...

954
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:37,917
To torture you?

955
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,625
I have more persuasive means.

956
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:46,000
To confront you
with your contradictions.

957
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:16,500
Are you me?

958
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:22,458
Old?

959
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:23,958
33 isn't old.

960
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:26,292
It is. It's impossible anyway.

961
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,333
After all you've been through,

962
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,333
you don't believe I'm the future you?

963
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,833
What are my favorite movies?

964
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,958
The Before Saga.

965
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,667
It was a trilogy in your day,
so forget the last one.

966
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,042
Why are you here?

967
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,083
Constance brought me.

968
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:52,708
To tell you what I heard
when I was in your place.

969
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,000
We're not stealing Dad's computer.

970
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,375
Why?

971
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,542
Because it's wrong.

972
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,542
Is that it?

973
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:04,958
I'm not going to spoil your life
by revealing mine.

974
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:06,250
I bet you had a wild time!

975
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:08,000
That's right.

976
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:11,583
I've met people, I've traveled.

977
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,083
I have a great life.

978
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:14,917
And all thanks to Dad.

979
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,750
- I can live my own life.
- No, you can't.

980
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:21,417
I hate to say so, I swear,
but you can't.

981
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:26,250
We'd be struggling without Dad,
doing shitty jobs.

982
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:28,500
Because to be honest,

983
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:31,125
apart from moaning about the world...

984
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,333
We're pretty useless.

985
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:35,167
That's right.

986
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,750
There's something else.

987
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:42,625
He's going to get sick.

988
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,875
- What's wrong?
- You know what's wrong.

989
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:49,417
He's been drinking since Mom died.

990
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,000
He's going to need you.

991
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,958
Until the very end.

992
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:57,208
I don't believe you.

993
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,167
You're talking crap.

994
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,500
He'll mellow towards the end.

995
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,208
You'll be able to talk.

996
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,250
I can talk to him now.

997
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:09,500
I'll tell him to quit.

998
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:11,542
It's already too late.

999
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,458
It's already...

1000
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,042
Tell him you love him.

1001
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,375
It might sound dumb,

1002
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,208
but it's important.

1003
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:27,625
Believe me.

1004
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,208
Sorry to disappoint you.

1005
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,125
I didn't say you did.

1006
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,333
But I thought that in your place.

1007
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,125
What now?

1008
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,667
You're going to bed.

1009
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:28,500
And Alice?

1010
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:30,625
She'll know what to do.

1011
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:42,042
Thank you for your cooperation.

1012
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,375
Sorry to look so overjoyed.

1013
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:29,083
Glad to be of service, Constance.

1014
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:31,167
Fox...

1015
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:34,250
your arrogance is inappropriate.

1016
01:07:34,792 --> 01:07:37,667
- You've destroyed lives.
- And saved many.

1017
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,167
I doubt it.

1018
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,792
But you don't remember.

1019
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,250
Do you know why?

1020
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:45,042
When we accomplish a mission

1021
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:47,458
and outfox you, Time starts over again.

1022
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:48,917
So you can't remember.

1023
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:50,792
Infuriating, isn't it?

1024
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,792
Do you remember?

1025
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:56,833
Only those who alter Time
remember the other realities.

1026
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,042
That's the rule.

1027
01:07:58,667 --> 01:07:59,542
Is it frequent?

1028
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:01,500
You have no idea!

1029
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:02,583
He's lying.

1030
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:04,250
He always does.

1031
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:05,917
To unsettle you.

1032
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,708
- And it works.
- Not on me.

1033
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:12,667
This is the end
of your criminal activities.

1034
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,667
You're finished, Fox.

1035
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,583
Today's the big day!

1036
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:27,167
You're signing the deal with Axomako.

1037
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,375
Yes. They're expecting us.

1038
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:30,625
The pressure!

1039
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:32,958
For your crimes,

1040
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,500
I am sentencing you
to a long stay in the Hole.

1041
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,125
What's the Hole?

1042
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:40,417
A prison where Time does not exist.

1043
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,167
I hope you made up with Alice.

1044
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,625
- More or less.
- She's a great girl.

1045
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,042
I mean that respectfully.

1046
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,833
Eyes on the road, please.

1047
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:59,042
It takes guts to oppose your dad.

1048
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,583
- Fabio.
- Yes?

1049
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,917
- You talk too much.
- Yes, sir.

1050
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:09,458
But you're right.

1051
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,333
It takes guts.

1052
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:17,250
Turn around.

1053
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:18,667
What?

1054
01:09:19,083 --> 01:09:20,500
We're going home.

1055
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,792
Something's amiss.

1056
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:34,833
TIME CHANGE IN PROGRESS

1057
01:09:54,708 --> 01:09:55,958
Don't you have a meeting?

1058
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:59,125
I'd rather be here with you.

1059
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,625
What about the plant?

1060
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:04,458
She wouldn't have approved.

1061
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,500
I wish you'd known her.

1062
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,292
Why didn't the doctor save Mom?

1063
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,333
He wanted to save you both.

1064
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,000
But I have you.

1065
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:42,708
You know...

1066
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,375
I still like Franklin the Turtle.

1067
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:49,042
I knew it!

1068
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:57,292
What's going on?

1069
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,667
I don't get it.

1070
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:01,958
A change is underway?

1071
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:04,042
It's an internal change.

1072
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,000
It's Gilbert, not us.

1073
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:07,375
You can't interfere.

1074
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:14,167
I can do whatever I like.

1075
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,083
Matteo, Louise, find Gilbert.

1076
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,625
- Don't, Constance!
- Make sure he goes to his meeting.

1077
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:22,667
If he refuses?

1078
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:24,333
Threaten to kill his daughter.

1079
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,292
What?

1080
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:28,167
She serves no purpose.
I studied her life.

1081
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:29,750
She lacks ambition.

1082
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,042
She cannot alter Time.

1083
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:36,000
Hang on, we almost killed some kids!

1084
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,458
You refuse?

1085
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,750
Very well.
Victor, you're mission leader.

1086
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:41,250
What did I tell you?

1087
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:42,417
Go with Matteo.

1088
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:45,417
Unless he objects?

1089
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:50,458
No. Let's go.

1090
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:20,583
Mole, I asked you to solder
the green wire to the red wire.

1091
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:25,125
Then connect the green wire
to the console.

1092
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:26,833
Gently with my kneecap.

1093
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,917
Mole, the green wire to the red wire!

1094
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:33,750
Thank you, sweetie!
It's just what I didn't want.

1095
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,375
- Doctor?
- One second.

1096
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:37,375
I said the small pliers, Skunk.

1097
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:39,583
Mole, it's the...
Can you see or not?

1098
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:40,667
Doctor!

1099
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:41,667
What?

1100
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:42,792
We have a problem.

1101
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:50,417
Stay there.

1102
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:04,000
Time Patrol, motherfucker!

1103
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,958
What is this?

1104
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,292
Go with Matteo.
The girl stays with me.

1105
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:09,917
Just hold on!

1106
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:12,833
Let go of me!

1107
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,250
Shut it!

1108
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,958
The boss says she's hopeless
and her life is too.

1109
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,167
So if she dies...

1110
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,042
no one will give a shit.

1111
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,542
Let go of me!

1112
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:26,833
Gilbert, do what was asked of you
and things'll work out.

1113
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,375
I know you tried, Dad.

1114
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,458
That's all that matters.

1115
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,917
I'm sorry.

1116
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:44,958
Let's go.

1117
01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:53,500
I don't know why I'm laughing!

1118
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:56,917
Don't move.

1119
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:59,000
You've lost, Constance.

1120
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:02,875
We protect the course of Time.
If we lose, everyone loses.

1121
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:05,375
Louise, take the prisoners to the Hole.

1122
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,583
Richard...

1123
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,292
go with them and supervise.

1124
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,250
Understood.

1125
01:14:39,417 --> 01:14:40,333
Fabio, the office.

1126
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,167
- Who's he?
- Don't ask questions!

1127
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,375
Right...

1128
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:54,750
The procedure is this:
you climb into the Hole

1129
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:56,875
and you won't feel a thing.

1130
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,000
Or so I've heard.

1131
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:02,333
Richard...

1132
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:05,542
there's something weird down there.

1133
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,292
What?

1134
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:10,292
You!

1135
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,083
If you succeed,
no one will remember that, right?

1136
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,375
No one in the patrol but you.

1137
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:25,000
By helping us,
you're involved in the time change.

1138
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:31,917
You don't remember
because we were enemies

1139
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,667
but we've met several times.

1140
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,458
Well...

1141
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:37,250
nice to meet you, again.

1142
01:15:37,792 --> 01:15:40,458
OK, what do you guys need?

1143
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:47,042
It'd be great if Constance thinks
I put up a fight back there.

1144
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:49,750
Sure. A real hero who did karate!

1145
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,542
- Seriously?
- No.

1146
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,833
- Run into anyone?
- No. Got the gear?

1147
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,292
We found this on a criminal

1148
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,167
and took this from you.

1149
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:01,417
- Know how to use it?
- Sure.

1150
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:04,667
I don't just play video games,
I observe sometimes.

1151
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:05,792
Glad to hear it.

1152
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:06,625
Here's the plan.

1153
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:09,833
Raph, save Alice
and tell her dad she's safe.

1154
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,667
I'll deal with Matteo. Louise?

1155
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,833
I'll take care of Constance.

1156
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,500
Will you be OK?
Victor's dumb but dangerous.

1157
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,875
Sure, I'll sneak up on him.
He won't see me...

1158
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:21,542
...coming!

1159
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:22,583
Oh fuck!

1160
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:35,458
- Are you there yet?
- Almost.

1161
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:36,875
Everything's under control.

1162
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,750
We dealt with the prisoners.

1163
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:51,958
Where's Richard?

1164
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,375
What was that?

1165
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:00,750
Oh fuck!

1166
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:07,375
The prisoners have escaped!

1167
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Bye-bye.

1168
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:18,500
Raph?

1169
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,875
Raph!

1170
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,208
Don't move.

1171
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:42,875
Stop moving!

1172
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:43,875
Catch...

1173
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:45,208
me...

1174
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:46,375
if you can!

1175
01:18:58,792 --> 01:18:59,750
Gotcha!

1176
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,250
- Is he OK?
- Stay in the car.

1177
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:14,792
You bas...

1178
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:16,500
But...

1179
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:19,000
Where's he gone?

1180
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,792
...tard!

1181
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:33,125
Matteo, good luck!

1182
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:35,583
Pliers, pliers, pliers!

1183
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:38,708
Where are you at?

1184
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:41,958
I usually have more time
to build time-travel machines!

1185
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:45,125
- How can I help?
- Find me an eye, arms, legs!

1186
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,500
Contactor!

1187
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,667
Doc, we have to get them out.

1188
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:50,208
I'm doing my best!

1189
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:16,708
Oh shit!

1190
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,833
Freeze!

1191
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:30,792
So long!

1192
01:21:50,792 --> 01:21:52,958
We've never had a good chat.

1193
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,917
Hang on.

1194
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:21,042
OK, so you can hold your breath,
now get out!

1195
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,000
I knew it!

1196
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,125
Surrender.

1197
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:33,625
You asked for this!

1198
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:12,333
Stop! He's unconscious.

1199
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:14,917
Thanks, Alice.

1200
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,500
No, well, er...

1201
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:22,417
I didn't do much.
I didn't have a plan as such.

1202
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:23,417
I was in the shit!

1203
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:24,917
Right.

1204
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:29,333
You have to call your dad, now!

1205
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:39,000
It's too late.

1206
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:43,583
We've got your friend.

1207
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:51,417
Hurry up, they're waiting!

1208
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:51,292
I'm sorry.

1209
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:52,708
I've failed.

1210
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:01,042
What about the children?

1211
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:05,375
Can you help them?

1212
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:17,542
I won't do it.

1213
01:26:17,917 --> 01:26:18,875
What?

1214
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:21,542
Sacrifice Dad to save the world.

1215
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,208
It isn't right.

1216
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:26,667
Got a plan?

1217
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:27,750
Yes.

1218
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:31,083
But you won't like it.

1219
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:06,167
Go on.

1220
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,583
I guess this is it, Labuse.

1221
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:24,250
So long, sonny.

1222
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:26,917
People can teach you so much.

1223
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,750
You've taught me nothing.

1224
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:32,083
Except friendship.

1225
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:34,500
And I've had so much fun.

1226
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:36,792
It's been great, Labuse.
Don't change.

1227
01:27:37,417 --> 01:27:38,458
Just stop killing.

1228
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:40,167
Come on, Thomas.

1229
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:41,750
Dr. Simon, Labuse,

1230
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:43,375
so long!

1231
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,375
I'm sorry.

1232
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:04,125
I didn't want to threaten the girl.
She's a harmless civilian.

1233
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:06,417
Don't underestimate her.

1234
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:17,625
What the...?

1235
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:22,958
Here we go!

1236
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:36,542
Alice?

1237
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:01,000
I don't understand.

1238
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:03,542
You heard me.

1239
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,167
Save the mother,

1240
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:07,500
not the daughter.

1241
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,750
I can save both.

1242
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:15,500
No.

1243
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:17,750
You can't.

1244
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,292
The mother.

1245
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:25,625
Not the daughter.

1246
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,208
Do as she says.

1247
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,667
Alice is erasing herself from Time.

1248
01:30:35,042 --> 01:30:36,000
We've won.

1249
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,250
You won't remember any of this.

1250
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,042
Hello.

1251
01:31:29,792 --> 01:31:31,083
Who are you?

1252
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:33,583
Nobody.

1253
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,375
No! This can't be happening!

1254
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:44,875
I don't want to forget her!

1255
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,958
Her name's Alice.

1256
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:49,000
Her name's Alice.

1257
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:53,667
Her name's...

1258
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:03,125
Who's Alice?

1259
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:13,250
She's...

1260
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:17,250
Alice was your sister's name.

1261
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:22,292
But she was still-born.

1262
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:24,667
That's sad.

1263
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:27,542
You're here now.
That's what counts.

1264
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:32,375
Why's Dad pulling a weird face?

1265
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:37,958
I was supposed to sign something.

1266
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:39,333
I don't remember what.

1267
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,917
Alzheimer's strikes!

1268
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:45,000
You signed the deal yesterday, look.

1269
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,750
You're on vacation now.

1270
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:53,250
Alibert launches experimental
renewable energy project

1271
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:58,958
I remember now.
Fantastic!

1272
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:03,917
You're wonderful.

1273
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:05,375
You're so beautiful.

1274
01:33:05,542 --> 01:33:06,833
I love you.

1275
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:09,333
Me too. Are you OK?

1276
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,333
I love your hair that way.

1277
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:15,333
You smell good, honey.

1278
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:26,042
You OK?
Back to normal?

1279
01:33:26,875 --> 01:33:27,917
Yes.

1280
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:32,583
- It's always a bit painful.
- Only natural.

1281
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,917
Your brain is rearranging
the layers of reality.

1282
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:36,833
It'll end up as mush.

1283
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:40,125
How is everyone?
And the cloud?

1284
01:33:40,292 --> 01:33:41,542
As if it never existed.

1285
01:33:42,958 --> 01:33:44,875
- And the kids?
- As grubby as ever!

1286
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:48,667
You lost!

1287
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,042
Good.

1288
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,375
We did it.

1289
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:55,125
A patrol member helped us for once.

1290
01:34:00,417 --> 01:34:03,750
Unlike her buddies,
our ally remembers everything.

1291
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,083
We've turned an agent.

1292
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:19,417
Louise.

1293
01:34:19,917 --> 01:34:21,125
Constance.

1294
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:24,792
And if we can turn one...

1295
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:31,583
the opportunities are endless.

1296
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,417
Time travel has no rules?
We can do whatever we like.

1297
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:51,667
No. You don't get it, eh?

1298
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:56,333
Alice created a totally
unprecedented time paradox.

1299
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:59,375
It was risky and could have
had dramatic consequences.

1300
01:34:59,542 --> 01:35:00,542
- OK.
- Got that?

1301
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:01,500
No.

1302
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:04,417
What matters is that she succeeded.

1303
01:35:04,583 --> 01:35:06,625
And she's been waiting for her drink!

1304
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:08,583
A born complainer!

1305
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:12,333
Fifteen minutes or a century,
time's always relative.

1306
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,500
- Right?
- Nope, Raph.

1307
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:17,125
Thanks for having me on the team.

1308
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:19,083
Why am I still here though?

1309
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,667
You canceled your birth.

1310
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:24,583
Dying, however,
would have undone your act

1311
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,125
in that version of reality.

1312
01:35:26,292 --> 01:35:27,542
Got that?

1313
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:29,292
You exist without having existed.

1314
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:31,708
You're one of reality's drifters.

1315
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:33,667
I feel I exist though.

1316
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:36,208
We'll discuss that after a few pints.

1317
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,458
Let's drink!

1318
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:44,667
THE FIRST PUB
AFTER THE WORLD'S END

1319
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:04,375
THE VISITOR FROM THE FUTURE

1320
01:37:07,542 --> 01:37:12,667
In memory of Francis Boespflug

1321
01:41:01,458 --> 01:41:04,208
Subtitles by Susannah Rooke

1322
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:07,083
Subtitling TITRAFILM

1323
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:09,792
Action!

1324
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:18,333
No! Do not throw that can!
