1
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,351
救命！！
Help! 

2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,985
爱迪！
Eddie!  

3
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,945
爱迪！醒醒！
Eddie, wake up

4
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,239
-不要动！听我说！
-这是哪儿啊？
-Don't move. Okay, listen to me.
-Where are we?

5
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,240
-不管怎样都别站起来！
-这咋的了这是？
-Whatever you do, don't lean forward.
-What's this? What's...

6
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,452
-怎么一回事？
-别动！！
-What's going on?
-No!

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,836
两位好，我想玩个游戏
Hello. I want to play a game.

8
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,008
你们头上的机关,是一种象征，象征着无良放贷者
桎梏贷款者的罪行
The devices on your heads are symbolic
of the shackles that you place upon others.

9
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,680
明知他们的经济状况，你们仍发放贷款
You recklessly loan people money,
knowing their financial limitations,

10
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,268
硬逼借款者偿还高额利息
counting on repossessing
more than they could ever pay back.

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,190
你们这两个食肉者，今天将成为献肉者
You are predators,but today, you become the prey.

12
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,694
我要你们献出一定份量的肉块
And it is your own pound of flesh that I demand.

13
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,365
这都怪你！
This is your fault!

14
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,366
面前天秤，自由之门
The scale before you is your only path to freedom.

15
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,744
人数有限，两人争先
However, only one of you may pass,

16
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,706
通关代价：终极天罚
and the toll is the ultimate sacrifice,

17
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,420
切割砍剁，牺牲鲜肉
the sacrifice of flesh.

18
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,421
面前仪器，传送献祭
Before you are the instruments to exact this flesh.

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,176
一分钟内
Move with haste, though,

20
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,177
重量比对
for when the 60-second timer hits zero,

21
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,347
重者获胜，轻者失败
the one who has given the most flesh
will release their bindings,

22
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,893
败者下场，穿脑而亡
while the gears on your opponent's head
will engage, piercing their skull.

23
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,565
是生是死，自己选择
Who will offer the most flesh in order to save their life?

24
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,570
谋事在我，成事在人
The choice is yours.

25
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,571
不！
No!

26
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,459
我才不会坐以待毙，婊子！
I'm not dying for you, bitch!

27
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,846
不！
No!

27

   水浒三国金刚

28
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,222
我说，斯特拉姆探员
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,

29
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,561
你学会相信我了么
have you learned enough to trust me?

30
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,562
不过,如果选择不进去，那你就将长眠于此
For if you do not,
this room will forever be your tomb.

31
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,608
你将人间蒸发，生不见人，死不见尸
You will never be heard from again,
your body will never be found,

32
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,947
而我的黑锅，就由你来替我背着
and my legacy will become yours.

33
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,948
做出抉择吧
Make your choice.

33
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,996
“保护伞健康保险公司”

34
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,442
有个之前就存在的问题
There was a pre-existing condition,

35
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,443
您没有事先通知保险公司
which you did not inform your insurance company of.

36
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,033
谢谢
Thank you.

37
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,912
嘿亲爱的，好的，可是，非常非常抱歉
不用喊我回家吃饭了
Hey, babe. Good. Listen, I am so, so sorry,
but I can't make dinner.

38
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,545
单位有事，要见我的律师
I've got to work late again.
I have a meeting with my lawyer

39
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,007
忙好估计很晚了
this will keep me busy for the rest of the afternoon.

40
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,555
我知道今天是你的生日，我会补的，放心吧
I know it's your birthday,and I'll make it up to you. I promise

41
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,146
我爱你
Love you.

42
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,400
-额。。。刚才说到哪了？
-Uh, what were we talking about?
-说到你的证词
-We're talking about your deposition. 

43
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,070
别那么担心，黛比  
So worried about me, Debbie

44
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,156
在那种菜B律师面前，
Some small-time lawyer trying to squeeze us 

45
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,199
我不会说漏嘴的
is not going to get me to say anything I don't want to say. 

46
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,534
这我知道
I have no doubt about that,

47
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,535
但作为公司首席律师，你要是搞砸了，我也会跟着挨板子
but as lead counsel for this company,
if you screw up, it comes down on my ass.

48
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,997
所以呢，你的证词，准备得怎样了？ 
So what do you say we prep your deposition?

49
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,500
唉。。顶你条粉肠
Oh, Christ.

50
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,627
你还记得哈罗德・阿贝特先生的事吗？
Do you remember dealing with a Mr. Harold Abbott?

51
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,963
威总，凯西・帕特森找您，一号线
William, I have a Casey Patterson on Line One. 

52
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,964
让她留言，阿蒂嫂，我这周会打给她的  
Take another message, Addy, I'll get back to her this week

53
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,094
如果我有空的话。。。你继续
Sometime...Keep going

54
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,095
假如对方律师问起来，你怎么回答？
When opposing counsel asks about Mr. Abbot, how will you respond?

55
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,308
我会这么回复：
I am going to respond by saying：

56
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,269
作为这家公司客户索赔部的副主管
as Senior Vice President of Membership and Claims,

57
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,270
审查每份到期的保单是我的工作职责
it is my job to review to review every terminated policy.

58
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,941
话说那天阿贝特先生就坐在你现在
As a matter of fact, Mr. Abbot was sitting right where you are now 

59
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,942
这个位子上和我争论
when we discussed his appeal.

60
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,031
我。。。我就是搞不懂
I...I just don't get it

61
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,032
我给你们公司付了10多年的医保费
I've been with this insurance company for over ten years. 

62
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,035
我知道，哈罗德，但问题是：在审查过程中
I know, Harold, but unfortunately, when we reviewed your claim

63
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,371
我们发现你没有写明你以前的一项状况
we discovered that you failed to mention a previous condition. 

64
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,374
状况？哪有什么状况？
What condition? There's no condition

65
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,045
这份报告上说，你曾动过一次口腔手术，去除了下巴囊肿
It says here you had oral surgery to remove a cyst from your jaw. 

66
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,050
这。。简直荒谬！我得的是心脏病！
This is absurd! I have heart disease

67
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,969
和30年前的口腔手术有个鸟关系？！
It has nothing to do with some oral surgery
that I had 30 years ago!  

68
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,970
任何类型的口腔手术都会留下疤痕组织
Any type of oral surgery is going to leave scar tissue.

69
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,100
疤痕会引起牙龈疾病
Scar tissue can lead to gum disease

70
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,101
而你也该清楚：牙龈疾病会引发心脏病
and as you well know, gum disease can cause heart disease. 

71
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,313
你知道么。。你是在杀人！
You know what? You're-You're a criminal

72
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,526
你是个挨千刀的杀人犯！
You are goddamn criminal

73
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,154
爷每月付保费花了10年的钱，连感冒都没得过
I've paid my monthly premium for ten years without so much as a cold

74
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,827
现在真闹大病了，却只换来一纸否决？
and now that I'm actually sick, you're gonna deny my coverage?

75
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,828
- 爷要养家糊口！
- I have a family! 
- 我是按规矩办事,哈罗德
- Those are the rules, Harold! 

76
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,914
抱歉，这都是你自己造成的代价 
I'm sorry, but your own actions have caused this. 

77
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,961
这代价我怎么担得起？你等于判了我死刑
You've just given me a death sentence, I mean, who's gonna cover me now?

78
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,507
你这个白眼狼！
You just killed me

79
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,886
我也有家人, 他发飙我能理解
I have a family too, so I can empathize with his argument

80
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,182
但是谁让这家伙当初隐瞒实情呢？
But basically, the guy lied on his application

81
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,183
- 额。。。等一下，威廉
- Whoa, watch it, Will.
- 咋了？
- What? 

82
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,063
你是说他是故意的？
Do you think he did that on purpose? 

83
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,399
好吧
All right.

84
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,400
评估他的意图不是我的工作
It wasn't my job to assess what his intentions were

85
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,029
我的职责是核对其索赔申请书的准确性
It was my job to check the accuracy of his claim

86
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,198
社会对我们这行总是有偏见，
Everybody thinks we're the bad guys. 

87
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,199
可是，有几个人知道我们每年能帮助数百万人
Nobody mentions the millions of people we help every year 

88
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,870
转危为安？有几个人知道我们每年将几百万美金
捐献给慈善机构？
without inciden.Or the millions of dollars
we donate to charity every year 

89
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,291
又有谁知道我们赞助过多少免费诊所？
Or all the free clinics we support

90
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,085
-证词要简短，威廉，要有内涵
-“今天在遗嘱检验裁判所，
-Short answers, Will. Short answers.
-Today in probate court,

91
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,086
。。。史上最臭名昭著的连环杀手
The assets for one of history's most notorious serial killers

92
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,674
约翰・克莱默的资产,被依法分配
John Kramer, were distributed

93
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,675
其中大部分是他生前拥有的房地产集团产权，
不过在本台记者的调查下。。。
They were mainly in real estate holdings.
But in my time researching...

94
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,220
弱弱地问一句，是谁发现那申请书里的漏洞的？
One more question: Who found the error on his application? 

95
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,724
我手下六人工作组，绰号“疯狗队”
The Dog Pen. They work as a team

96
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,395
单据里一出现错误，他们立刻就能搜查出来
If there's a discrepancy to be found
in an application, the six of them will find it.

97
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,067
威总，他们在会议室等您
Sir, they're waiting for you in the conference room.

98
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,611
好的
Very good.

99
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,612
-今天如何啊，伙计们？
-很好很强大！
-How's it going today, people?
-Great, 

100
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,451
盾哥，这位慢性病客户有两处漏洞
Mr. E.，Found two application errors for a chronically ill client.

101
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,912
小样儿整天赖在他医生家里
This guy practically lives at his doctor's office.

102
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,748
我寻思咱大概可以省下20万
I mean, this could probably save us nearly 200K over his lifetime.

103
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,249
咱们的终结者又出击了啊
Terminator strikes again.

104
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,752
我去开会，几个钟头后回来
I'll be back in a few hours.

105
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,753
气色不错啊，老汉
Looking good, Hank.

106
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,757
为了生命，哪位愿意献出最重的人肉祭品？
Who will offer the most flesh in order to save their life?

107
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,887
决定权在于你们
The choice is yours.

108
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,888
我才不会坐以待毙，婊子！
I'm not dying for you, bitch!

109
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,236
喂?
Yeah.

110
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,237
我就来
I'm on my way

111
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,127
什么情况？
What's going on?

112
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,128
现场被FBI接管了，他们催你赶紧来
Feds who took over the crime scene are requesting you ASAP.

113
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,645
老埃
Erickson.

114
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,314
没想到你也会来干这种脏活
I didn't know you ever made it out from behind the desk.

115
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,315
拼图案现场发现指纹，我就特地过来瞧瞧
I make exceptions when fingerprints are found at a Jigsaw murder scene

116
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,405
看这
Have a look

117
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,242
磅秤那边也有几处相同的
We also got a right index off the scale. 

118
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,787
- 验证过没？
- Been IDed yet? 
- 恩，全部与小斯的指纹吻合
- Yeah. They're Agent Strahm's.

119
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,959
得知电锯门盯上他和小皮
When I learned he and Perez were being targeted by Jigsaw

120
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,963
我本该意识到这点的，可没想到事情会成这样
I should have been more aware, but I didn't see this coming

121
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,175
居然是小斯
Not from Peter Strahm

122
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,176
-大家都震精了
-是啊
-It was a shock to all of us.
-Yeah.

123
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,847
不过。。。有件事他还被蒙在鼓里
But we have something he doesn't know about.

124
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,519
跟我来
Follow me. 

125
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,193
琳塞（金刚注：小皮全名琳塞・皮瑞兹）
Lindsey.

126
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,449
-霍大队长
-皮瑞兹？！
-Detective Hoffman.
-Perez.

127
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,749
这是我的决定，霍警官
It was my call, Detective.

128
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,542
电锯门另有神秘门徒
I knew that Jigsaw wasn't working alone,

129
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,086
在没查到是谁之前
but until I knew for certain who was helping him

130
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,380
我要确保我部下的安全
I couldn't guarantee her well-being

131
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,381
-所以你把全世界人民都耍了？
-非常时期我选择保密
-So you let me think she was dead?
-Well, I didn't know who I could trust.

132
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,889
你们还有多少事瞒着我？
What else have you been keeping from me? 

133
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,890
我们了解到，先前地产蒙骗案那5个人，小斯都认识
We know that Agent Strahm knew the five people in the real estate scam

134
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,478
就是埃长官找到的那五个受害者
The victims in the traps that Erickson found

135
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,856
- 他怎么会认识？
- How did he know? 
- 小斯和我曾调查过火灾那案子
- Strahm and I investigated them after the house fire

137
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,484
那其实是起纵火案，五人都有责任
It was arson. All five people were accountable

138
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,485
但由于我们唯一的证人失踪，最终无法提出对五人的指控
But after our lone witness went missing,no charges were ever filed.

139
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,657
可能小斯不肯放过他们，所以就设置了
Strahm couldn't let them get away,so he put them in a trap

140
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,077
这场惨烈的五人自相残杀游戏
in which slaughtering each other was the only way out.

141
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,912
这话是什么意思？他成神雕大侠了么？
So what are you telling me? He's a vigilante? 

142
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,913
你怎么称呼都行，总之一定要找到他
Call him whatever you like,but he has to be found.

143
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,547
我们希望能和警方并肩作战
We'd like to work together on this. 

144
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,548
先前忽悠我说她死了，现在又要拉我做事？
You led me to believe that she was dead, and you want to work with me? 

145
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,345
听我说，霍警官，我们已经开诚布公了
Look, we're offering full disclosure, detective

146
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,346
从现在开始,双方信息同步更新,和谐了吧？
So from now on, everything we know, you know.Is that fair?

147
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,735
霍大队，简单采访您一会儿行吗
Detective Hoffman. How about a quick word?

148
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,736
帕梅拉・詹金斯，“拼图名记”
Pamela Jenkins, the resident Jigsaw sensation

149
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,323
我只是实话实说罢了，霍大队
Just reporting the facts, Detective.

150
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,324
最近是不是在写那篇<约翰・克莱默：屠杀之迷>？
Is that what you're doing?"John Kramer, conundrum of carnage."

151
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,413
你要是能发表有关的正式声明
If you'd like to make a statement on the record

152
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,956
我会更荣幸
I'd be more than happy to take it.

153
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,957
把事实真相曲解成诱人的故事,不负责任
You're twisting the facts to make a better story.
It's irresponsible

154
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,129
又一次见到你很高兴，失陪了
Excuse me. Nice catching up.

155
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,130
关于约翰・克莱默，我手上有你想不到的猛料
I know more about John Kramer than you might think

156
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,342
哦?说来听听
Somehow I doubt that

157
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,343
克莱默留给他老婆一个盒子作为遗产,这事你知道不？
Kramer left his wife a box in his will.Did you know that?

158
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,057
也许知道也许不知道,你是怎么知道的？
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.How do you know it?

159
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,058
遗嘱检验法院,这是公开记录,老百姓只要想知道就可以问到
Probate court. It's public record for those who know where to look.

160
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,105
这样啊，那么你到底想干嘛？
All right. What do you really want?

161
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,106
吉儿・塔克.帮个忙，让我找她谈谈，我保证今后不再哗众取宠
Jill Tuck. Help me get to her and I'll dial down on the sensationalism.

162
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,278
是嘛?这事日后再说
Really? I'll see what I can do.

163
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,292
你还记得被绑架到那里的过程么？
Do you remember how you were transported there?

164
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,293
啥都记不起来了
I don't know how I got there.

165
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,672
一睁开眼就。。。。是他干的
Just opened my eyes and...He did this to me.

166
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,343
是谁？
Who did this? 

167
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,014
拼图杀人狂
Jigsaw. 

168
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,015
-不是你自己把手砍下来的么？
-对，是我自己砍自己
-You didn't cut your own arm off?
-I did. I did.

169
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,022
但都是他逼我的！
But he made me do it. 

170
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,356
他为了什么呢？
Why is that? 

171
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,357
因为，我和爱迪做了错事
Because what Eddie and I were doing was wrong

172
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,863
我们。。我们害死了很多人
We were...we were ruining people's lives.

173
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,579
他在教训我们
He wanted us to learn

174
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,582
那你吸取教训了吗？
And did you? 

175
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,920
请你把眼睛睁大点
Look at me

176
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,674
好好瞧瞧我的胳膊！
Look at my goddamn arm!

177
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,675
你说我吸取教训了吗？
What the fuck am I supposed to learn from this?! Huh? 

178
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,887
看我的胳膊！！说啊！我该吸取什么样的教训！！
Look at my arm! What...What am I supposed to learn from this?

179
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,225
-请你冷静
-你回来!
-Just breathe.
-Look at me!

180
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,483
你好啊？丁丁宝宝（金刚注：孩子全名吉丁Gideon）
Hello Gillian!

181
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,486
-这名字真好听,老公
-哇哦,哇哦
-It's a good name, hon.
-Wow, Wow.

182
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,031
本来想取"斯嘉丽".但是咱家宝宝是男孩嘛
Could have been Scarlet.But, no, has to be a boy.

183
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,701
让爸爸看看镜头装不装得下咱一家人
Let me see if I can get all three of us in there.

184
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,664
来,抱紧,靠近点,笑一笑
Snuggle around here.Lean inside. There we go.

185
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,711
-拍个合家欢
-嘿,吉丁
-There we are.
-Hey, Gideon.

186
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,089
幸福的一家啊
Here's a little happy family.

187
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,090
-爸爸妈妈爱你,儿子,在等你出来哦
-我们爱你
-We love you, Son. We're waiting for you.
-We love you.

188
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,647
（碑文：吾儿吉丁・约翰・克莱默）

189
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,648
当你看这盘录像带的时候,吉儿,我已经不在人世了
If you're watching this, Jill,I'm long gone from this world.

190
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,653
我今天留了个宝盒给你,里面的东西至关重要
I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of grave importance.

191
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,156
你好，我现在不在家，有事请留言
Hello. I'm not in right now,but please leave a message.

192
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,701
塔克女士，你好，又是我,帕梅拉・詹金斯
Miss Tuck, this is Pamela Jenkins calling,
yet again.

193
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,581
我想问您一些有关您前夫的事
I was hoping you can clear some things up for me about your husband.

194
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,166
能否赏脸一起吃顿午饭或者咖啡什么的
Let me buy you lunch or a cup of coffee.

195
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,167
关于约翰・克莱默,我发现了一些有趣的东西
I've found something interesting about John Kramer's death.

196
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,672
是你吗？警官
Are you there, Detective?

197
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,673
听到这盘带子，有人一定以为一切都结束了
By hearing this tape,some will likely assume this Is over.

198
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,471
你觉得可以掌控局势了是吗？
You feel you now have control, don't you?

199
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,683
你以为不经过考验就太平了？
You think you will walk away untested.

200
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,859
看这
Look here.

201
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,860
这张是以前那些死者身上的拼图
These are the Jigsaw pieces carved from previous victims

202
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,699
而那张是最近一次的
This is the piece taken from the latest victim

203
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,495
-不是一样的么？
-It looks like all the rest
-是啊，一开始我们也这么认为
-Yeah, that's what we said, too. 

204
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,998
对比拼图印记，最近这次的是用一种锯齿缘刀切割而成
The skin abrasions, they're indicative of a knife of a partially serrated edge.

205
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,465
-那以前的呢？
-So?
-以前的则是由某种近乎完美的
-So, all of the other cuts were made

206
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,466
高质量手术刀切出来的
with a near-perfect blade of surgical quality.

207
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,473
看来斯特拉姆用的刀不一样
Obviously, Strahm used a different knife than John Kramer. 

208
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,474
恩，不过这线索引起了我们的注意，我们对所有拼图印记做两相比较
Right, but it got us curious, so we pulled the files to compare

209
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,021
发现只有一名死者身上的拼图与其纹路一致
That same knife was used on only one other victim

210
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,232
是塞斯・巴克斯特
That victim was Seth Baxter

211
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,233
那个杀你妹妹的人
The man who killed your sister. 

212
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,569
你们光凭照片就能看出割印记用的刀不一样？
You're telling me that you can tell
a different knife was used from a photo?

213
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,032
他们不能，但我能.塞斯的尸体，是我解剖的
No, but I can.I was the one who examined that body.

214
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,414
实际上所有拼图案的尸体，都是我解剖的
I've examined every body of the Jigsaw Killer. 

215
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,581
解剖帝
Good work. 

216
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,582
在割肉游戏现场没有找到录像带，所以我们在找塞斯的那盘带子
The tape from the latest victim was missing, so we're looking into the Seth Baxter tape. 

217
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,920
-找来组撒？
-我在想，既然拼图印记有可能是山寨的
-Why's that?
-Well, if a different person cut the piece,

218
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,549
那么录像带也有可能是盗版的
then maybe a different person made the tape, too.

219
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,344
- 是斯特拉姆？
- Strahm? 
- 是啊，有可能
- Yeah, maybe. 

220
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,724
如果查出录像里是小斯的声音那就证据确凿了
Strahm's voice on the tape would be our smoking gun.

221
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,725
就可以正式颁布全国通缉令
We have that, we could go public with his involvement. 

222
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,233
嘿,吉儿
Hey, Jill.

223
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,237
-可那不是我们所开的方....
-我得病了!
-But that's not what the prescription...
-I'm sick!

224
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,240
-看着我!看着我!
-简，简，没事的，好吗？淡定
-Look at me! Look at me!
-Jane,Jane,it's ok,allright?Relax

225
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,801
这么急着见我？
I didn't expect to see you here so soon. 

226
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,140
计划不如变化
Change of plans.

227
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,141
-游戏今晚开始
-咋的?
-The game begins tonight.
-Why?

228
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,813
因为有人知道了宝箱的事
Because somebody knows about the box that shouldn't. 

229
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,774
-谁？
-Who? 
-这个你甭管  
-That's not your concern.

230
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,775
你只要明白一点：从现在开始,这场游戏我做主
All you need to know is that：from now on,I control all aspects of the game.

231
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,990
约翰可不是这么想的
That's not what John wanted.

232
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,991
把信封交出来，我这可不是在求你
Give me the envelopes. That's not a request.

233
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,797
给
Here.

234
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,509
从今儿起,我单飞
From now on, I work alone.

235
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,553
我懂.我只是在了结约翰最后的遗愿
I know.I'm only carrying out John's final request.

236
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,599
老头已经死了，电锯门完蛋了
Well, John's dead. And his work is almost done

237
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,524
- 介寺谁?
- Who's this? 
- 未竟的任务
- Unfinished business. 

238
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,196
事成之后，你我各安天命
When I'm done, we no longer speak. 

239
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,460
-45分钟
-是,我知道
-...forty-five minutes.
-Yes, I understand that.

240
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,128
-求你了!求求你!
-我们得等医生
-Please! Please.
-But we have to wait for the doctor.

241
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,129
你松开!
Let my hand go.

242
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,216
美沙酮（金刚注：戒毒用品，类似吗啡）只是个幌子，它治标不治本
Methadone is only a masking agent. It doesn't heal; it just simply numbs the senses

243
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,264
我找到了一种更有效的救人方式
I've found a better way

244
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,101
这些人，他们还会继续伤害你令你失望
These people, they will continue to hurt you, and let you down.

245
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,900
他们是吸毒者，约翰，戒毒需要过程
They're addicts, John. Recovery is a process. 

246
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,901
也许依赖是人的一种本性
Maybe addiction is just a part of human nature.

247
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,238
可是这些人，吉儿，这些每天在这进进出出的人
But what about these people, Jill, who come here every day 

248
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,618
他们在利用你，戒的不是毒，是寂寞.逃避牢狱之灾
and use you? They bide their time.They're avoiding prison sentences

249
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,415
吸食吗啡成瘾，你管这叫“戒毒”？
They're getting hooked on masking agents，Do you call that recovery? 

250
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,878
戒毒不是那么简单的
It's not that simple.

251
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,879
做伸手党却很简单，吉儿!醒醒吧!
Addiction is not simple, Jill! Wake up!

252
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,759
这些自毁人生的人对生命没有丝毫的尊重
These people have no respect for the lives that they're destroying

253
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,807
人只有到生死攸关的时刻， 
Once you see death up close, 

254
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,189
才真正懂得人生价值
then you know what the value of life is

255
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,695
这就是我的方式
And that's my way.

256
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,740
我把能证明其有效的证据带来了
And I brought proof that it works.

257
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,125
- 阿曼达？
- Amanda?
- 好啊，吉儿
- Hello, Jill. 

258
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,089
吉儿
Jill,

259
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,468
你曾跟我说，她迷失了灵魂
you once told me that she was a lost soul.

260
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,434
现在，她就在这
But here she stands.

261
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,435
她接受了洗礼，脱胎换骨
She's clean and whole.

262
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,482
不再浑噩，对重生满怀感激
And she has a new appreciation for her life.

263
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,236
没错,确实行之有效,门主救了我
It works. It's real. He helped me.

264
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,467
并不是危言耸听，装神弄鬼

265
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,887
但种种迹象告诉我们：麻烦事又来了

266
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,392
尽管警方已确认拼图杀人狂约翰克莱默已死亡

267
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,550
然而就在上周，可怕的事实表明：拼图杀人游戏再度发生了

268
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,194
凶犯杀人的手法

269
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:51,195
与拼图杀人狂极为相似

270
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,532
拼图杀人狂已死，但虐杀却仍在继续

271
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,337
妈的！
Shit!

272
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,384
汉克，你还在不？
Hank, you still here?

273
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,002
不许动！
Don't fucking move.

274
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,928
我。。。日！我操！没事的
Shit! Oh, fuck! Okay.

275
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,015
我会救你的，别怕，内家伙在哪？你怎么穿着马甲啊？
Okay, I'm gonna take care of you. Just...
Where'd you get hit? You wearing a vest?

276
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,810
你好啊，威廉
Hello, William.

277
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,311
我地妈。。。
Oh, Jesus.

278
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,312
你可能想过你我何时会再次见面
You've probably been wondering when we would see each other again.

279
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,151
-就在今天
-不！！
-Today is that day.
-No!

280
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,152
多年来，你的概率公式理论左右了不少人的命运
For years, your probability formula has decided the fate of others. 

281
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,533
健康的人受益
The healthy have benefited

282
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,534
而生病的人却被不公平地拒绝接受保险
while the potentially sick have been unjustly rejected.

283
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,496
但是你的理论没有考虑到人的求生欲望
However, this formula does not take into account the human will to live. 

284
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,835
面对死亡
When faced with death,

285
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,836
“应该活命者”和“能够生存者”是两个截然不同的概念
who should live versus who will live
are two entirely separate things.

286
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,093
今天你的理论将要受到考验
Today, your policy will be put to the test.

287
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:20,094
你的四肢都被安装了引爆装置，你必须完成四个游戏任务
There are four straps around your limbs,
and you have four tests you must complete,

288
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,766
但如果你拒绝参与游戏，便四处爆炸
for if you don't, the straps on your arms
and legs will detonate.

289
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,482
仔细看
Look closely.

290
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,196
我操！
Oh, shit!

291
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,197
60分钟内必须完成全部任务，否则下场如此，
现在开始计时
You have 60 minutes to complete your tests
and avoid this fate, starting now.

292
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,746
这一路你并不孤单
You are not alone in this game.

293
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,708
如同你害死别人的亲人那样
Just as you have taken loved ones away
from their families,

294
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,627
一旦你时间用尽而又没能通关，
if you don't reach the end before the timer hits zero

295
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,628
就再也见不到你的家人
you will never see your family again.

296
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,050
妈妈？妈妈！醒醒，妈妈！
Mom? Mom! Mom. Mom, wake up! Mom.

297
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,475
妈妈
Mom.

298
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,476
-我们介寺在哪？
-母鸡
-Where are we?
-I don't know.

299
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,147
- 那是什么？
- What's that?
- 不知道啊
- I don't know

300
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,405
额的个神呐。。
Oh, my God.

301
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,286
这是你的第一个考验
Here is your first test. 

302
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,287
你健康的体魄和军人出身为你取得了巨大成功
Your health and military background puts you in the highest category of success.

303
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,584
面前这个对手跟你大相径庭 
However, the same cannot be said for your adversary. 

304
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,714
52年来，即便身患高血压和心脏病，
At only 52 years of age, this man has continued to smoke

305
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,469
这个人仍然吸烟过度
even though he has a history of high blood pressure and heart disease.

306
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,015
看来他对自己的幸福人生很是满意
This demonstrates his appreciation of the blessings of his own life

307
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,062
你的这款游戏纠结于一种简单的元素：氧气
Your game will focus on a simple element.

308
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,025
游戏启动后，你每吸一口氧气
From there, once this game begins, every time you take a breath, 

309
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,987
腰部巨钳都会夹紧，直到挤碎你的身体
the clamps around your chest will close in and crush your body. 

310
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,492
唯一的胜利条件就是对方的失败
The only way to escape is in the other's failure. 

311
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,537
所以我想问你的是：面对死亡威胁，谁能生存下来？
So I ask you, when faced with death, who will survive? 

312
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,793
是生是死，威廉，做出你的决定
Live or die, William. Make your choice. 

313
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,422
- 决你妈！！
- Fuck you!! 
- 那扇贝到底是谁！！
- Who the hell is that?! 

314
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,348
屏住呼吸！
Hold your breath

315
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,001
我操！耶稣啊！
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus!

316
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,912
快啊！快点啊！
Come on! Come on!

317
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,714
靠！
Shit!

317
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:14,114
（腐蚀性物品）

318
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,350
请救救我们！
Please help us!

319
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,351
救我们啊！救命啊！救人呐！求求你们！
Help us! Someone, please! Please! Help us!

320
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,356
来人救命啊！救命啊！有没有人？求你了！
Somebody, please! Please!Please, somebody help!

321
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,905
来人呐！
Anybody?

322
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,906
“生”？“死”？这什么玩意儿？
"Live. Die." What the fuck?

323
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,787
连着内个
It's connected to that.

324
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,628
-“H-F”？那是什么
-是“万腐之王”氢氟酸
-"H-F." What does that stand for?
-Hydrofluoric acid.

325
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,802
人身上一沾这鬼东西，瞬间就被腐蚀掉
This stuff will eat through human flesh
within seconds.

326
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,681
-我们怎么办
-拉这个扳手吧，咱要求“生”存，对吧？
-What should we do?
-Pull the lever. You want to live, don't you?

327
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,019
那计时器又是什么？算什么意思？
What about the timer?It has to mean something

328
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:06,023
我不知道，我都不知道为什么我们会在这！
I don't know,I don't even know why we're here

329
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,818
我们在这，是因为你爸爸
We're here because your father

330
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,744
詹金斯小姐
Miss Jenkins.

331
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,705
求你了，很快就好，我们可以互利互助
Please, this will only take a second.We can help each other.

332
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,041
是什么让你觉得我俩可以互利互助？
What makes you think you can come to my door like this? 

333
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,042
我找到了一样你一定很想看到的东西
Because I found something you'll want to see

334
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,004
看吧
Go on.

335
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,885
-你在哪找到的？
-就在约翰死的那个肉厂
-Where'd you get this?
-It was at the location where John died.

336
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,305
-怎么样，有帮助吧？
-没有
-Does it mean anything to you?
-No.

337
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,934
再见了，詹小姐
Goodbye, Miss Jenkins.

338
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,649
想到什么就打给我
If you think of anything.

339
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:29,689
“那次派对”

339
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,129
非常感谢你对这次派对的鼎力支持，威廉
I want to thank you for sponsoring this party, William.

340
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,130
诊所的开办也要好好谢谢你们公司的赞助
and I know how much the clinic appreciates it. 

341
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,218
-约翰・克莱默
-威廉・伊斯盾
-John Kramer.
-William Easton.

342
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,846
-克莱默？哦您是吉女士的丈夫吧？
-是的
-Kramer? You're Jill's husband, right?
-I am.

343
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,807
-很高兴见到你
-我也是
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

344
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,976
貌似你们和我们算是同道中人呢，老翰
Sounds like we're in a similar business, John. 

345
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,102
哦是吗？怎么说？
Oh, yeah? How's that? 

346
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,103
你们诊所试图预测病人的行为，我们也是
Well, you try to predict people's behavior. So do I

347
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,859
人们找上我们是求一个依靠
People count on us for coverage, 

348
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,860
我们得仔细分析每个客户的可服务性
and we have to analyze each person for the probability of success. 

349
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:01,033
- 你们是怎么分析的？
- How do you do that? 
- 我们有一套公式
- Well, it's a formula.

350
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,743
说起来有点复杂，不过大体上
It's pretty complicated, actually, 

351
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,287
是这样算的：“按月支付能力”
but, in essence,it breaks down to monthly payments

352
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,288
乘以“预期生命期限” 减去“患病概率”
multiplied by lifespan minus the probability of illness.

353
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,625
得出结果是正数的话就可以考虑为其办理医保
and if its sum is positive, we consider coverage.

354
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,254
- 这公式是谁发明的？
- Who devised that formula? 
- 本盾
- Me. 

354
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:21,254
如此说来，在某种程度上，你能选择谁生谁死？
So, in a sense... you choose who lives or dies? 

355
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,848
啊不是，我是说我选择那些更有潜力活下去的人
No, I, uh... No, I'd say I decide which people have the potential 

356
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,896
那些健康长寿的人
to live long, healthy lives.

357
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,897
但你无视了生存法则中最重要的一个人为因素
But you're not taking into onsideration the most important human element of all. 

358
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,984
-是什么？
-求生意志
-Which is what?
-The will to live.

359
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,155
只有当一个人面对生死关头，
Until a person is faced with death, 

360
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,575
才能判断出他是否有继续生存下去的可能性
it's impossible to tell whether the have what it takes to survive.

361
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,990
（抓住两头）

361
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,090
抓你妹
Fuck that.

362
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,762
日！
Shit.

363
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,913
你好，威廉
Hello, William.

364
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,914
站在我背后平台上的，是你的两个部下
Standing on the platforms behind me are two of your colleagues. 

365
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,460
一个，是文档管理员阿伦：一个无亲无故的健康小伙子
One, your file clerk. a young, healthy male
with no living relatives.

366
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,049
另一个，是中年女接线员阿蒂嫂，她有家族糖尿病史
The other, a middle-aged woman with a family history of diabetes.  

367
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:30,514
根据你的理论，年迈体弱的阿蒂嫂
According to your policy, your secretary is older and weaker and

368
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,435
不值得活下去
and therefore less worthy to survive.

369
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,022
但你也该知道她的死亡会对其家人造成多大的打击
But you know the loss that she will be to her family

370
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
而若选择救阿蒂嫂，那么阿伦将人间蒸发，消失得无影无踪
while young Allen will disappear without a blip on the world's radar.

371
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,782
只有一个人可以出这屋，选择权在你手上
Only one can exit this room, and the choice of whom falls upon you.

372
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,247
想要救其中一个，就必须牺牲另一个
You must let go of the one to save the life of the other. 

373
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,710
就像你所看到的，这种情况远比你面对
As you can see, the choice is not so clear 
374
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,711
那些血会弄污你的手的投保者棘手得多
when you are face to face with the people
whose blood will stain your hands.

375
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,467
游戏开始
Let the game begin.

376
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,055
等等！别走！等下！不！我不会那么做的！我不会那么做的！
Wait! No! No, wait!I won't do this! I won't do this!

377
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,404
威总！
William!

378
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,405
介揍寺僧活！那不是我的本意！
It's a business!My decisions aren't made this way!

379
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,997
我不会放手的！我不放手！！
No! I'm not going to do it! I'm not going to do it! 

380
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,998
我绝不松手！
I'm not going to do it! 

381
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,254
-停下来！！
-Stop it!!
-救救我。。。求你！
-Please..help me...

382
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,405
-对不起
-不！不！
-I'm sorry.
-No! No!

383
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,624
对不起。。。
I'm sorry.

384
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,994
呜呜。。。谢谢。。谢谢
Thank you. Thank you!

385
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,379
阿蒂嫂，想办法逃出去吧，我还得赶路，你自己小心点
You try to find a way out of here, Addy.
I have to keep going. Be careful.

386
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,833
把这酸液泼铁栏杆会怎样？能腐蚀掉铁栏杆，对吧？
What if we put acid on the metal bars?
It'll eat through the metal, won't it?

387
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,834
能，可是我们怎么泼？用手盛吗？
Yeah, but how are we going to get it on the bars? With our hands?

388
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,843
你在看什么？
What are you looking at?

389
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,844
我想知道。。。这镜子后面
I wonder... The mirror.

390
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,265
-怎么了？
-是谁在镜子后面监视我们
-What?
-Who's behind the glass?

391
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,688
你要干什么！
What do you want!

392
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,900
为什么要这么做！！
Why are you doing this?

393
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,238
来人救命啊！求你了！请救救我！！
Somebody help me, please.Please help me.

394
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,758
你好，帕梅拉。你为了自身利益曲解真相
Hello, Pamela.You've sensationalized my life,

395
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,219
耸人听闻，恶意诋毁我的生活。。。。
twisting the truth and exploiting my message for your own benefit.

396
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,168
-我是
-是我，埃里克森
-Hoffman.
-It's Erickson.

397
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:11,169
-我们找到了塞斯・巴克斯特的带子
-是嘛？
-We found the Seth Baxter tape.
-Yeah?

398
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,342
有件事想跟你讨论
But there was something else we wanted to discuss with you. 

399
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,220
- 什么事？
- What's that? 
- 还是当面谈比较好
- Better to talk about it in person.

400
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,972
赶紧过来吧
It's time-sensitive.

401
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,973
我很快就来
I'll be right there.

402
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:35,959
圣・尤斯塔斯医院

402
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,659
请问一下
Excuse me.

403
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,660
-往前走几步就到
-唔该
-Just down there.
-Thank you.

404
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,183
这套捆绑蒂莫西的机器是我的大爱。我取名为“人体扭转机”
The device Timothy is strapped to is my personal favorite. I call it The Rack.

405
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,407
临时抱佛脚？我早说过他搞不好
Last-minute tweaks?Told you he'd fuck with it. 

406
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,203
如果你要切换齿轮转速
If you switch the gear ratio,

407
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,204
就得更改齿轮油以降低摩擦力
you have to change the gear grease to match the increased friction. 

408
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:33,543
我看给你配台起重机算了
Maybe you should stick to the heavy lifting.

409
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:37,299
小样儿该减肥了
You need five-weight.

410
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,300
枪的机关可别再弄错了
It's in the gun.

411
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:42,929
下次想修改要先通知我
Check with me next time. 

412
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,764
我们还有几个“下次”？
How many next times are there gonna be? 

413
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,765
世间需要几次，我们就玩几次
However many there needs to be. 

414
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,903
那毕竟是个活生生的人
That's a human being. 

415
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,243
你就那么崇尚暴力吗？马克（金刚注：二叔全名马克・霍夫曼）
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

416
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,244
咱们打开天窗说亮话吧，你我都是施虐狂
Let's be honest. You want him to suffer just as much as I do.

417
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,606
- 什么时候轮到你玩游戏啊？警官
- So when's your test, detective? 
- 我不需要玩
- I don't need one. 

418
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,070
- 哦？是吗？
- Oh, yeah? 
- 是啊
- Yeah.

419
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,071
因为，我不会像某人那样不把生命当回事
Because I don't take life for granted. 

420
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,617
这方面你还处于菜鸟级别
You're still dragging your knuckles on the ground. 

421
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,787
你对生命了解多少？
What do you know about life? 

422
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,003
你得习惯我唠叨，因为我会一直在这陪门主
Get used to me, 'cause I'm not going anywhere.

423
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,636
认真你就输了
You sure about that? 

424
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,932
时候不早了
Time is short.

425
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,314
您还好吗？
You okay?

426
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,944
你该去医院把戴伦医生（金刚注：莲恩全名莲恩・戴伦）带来了
Now it's time to get Dr. Denlon from the hospital. 

427
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,155
谨遵师旨，这就去办
Okay. I'll take you back.

428
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,477
快去快回
Go. Be quick.

429
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,865
- 你来干什么？
- Why'd you come here? 
- 约翰，停手吧
- John，stop

430
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,746
- 别再干了
- Don't do this. 
- 我向你保证
- I promise you

431
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,792
等一切都结束
when all this is done

432
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,922
我保你全身而退
I will provide a way out for you. 

433
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,886
我真希望是现在
I wish that time was now.

434
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:33,264
我有东西要给你
I have something for you.

435
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,364
这是干吗？
What is it for?

436
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,243
时辰一到，你便知晓
When the time's right,you'll know what to do with it.

437
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,861
操
Shit!

438
00:48:37,357 --> 00:48:38,456
“最终决定”

438
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,457
我得跟你谈谈，威廉，是这么回事
I came to talk to you, Will,because

439
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,504
我找到一套很有可能治好我癌症的疗法
I've found a treatment for my cancer that I think holds a lot of promise,  

440
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,550
但是我申请的医保理赔
but my requests for coverage 

441
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,139
却全部遭拒绝
have all been turned down.

442
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,933
所以我想当面来跟你解释一下
So I was hoping that maybe if I came and explained it to you, 

443
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,934
你看能不能帮我这个忙
that you might be able to get that overturned for me. 

444
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,190
-我职责所在，你说吧，老翰
-好
-Well, the buck stops here, John. Fire away.
-Okay.

445
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,698
这是位挪威医生
This is a doctor in Norway

446
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,699
他的基因治疗技术成功率达到了30-40%
He's got a thirty to forty percent success rate with gene therapy.  

447
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,370
他把名为“自杀式细胞”的基因注入癌变肿瘤细胞中
He injects what he calls suicide genes into cancerous tumor cells

448
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,834
能使细胞对抗癌药物更敏感，然后就可以。。。
then any inactive form of a toxic drug is administered and it... 

449
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,254
恩，我听说过这种“基因治癌”
Yes, I'm familiar with the therapy you're talking about. 

450
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,591
没错，这位医生正开展一项新试验
Right. And a new trial's starting.

451
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,344
他在找新的试验对象
He's looking for new patients, 

452
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,555
他觉得我是最佳人选
and he seems to think that I'm the perfect candidate.

453
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,556
老翰，要是你的主治医师哥登医生觉得你是最佳人选的话
John, if your primary physician, Dr. Gordon,
thought you were a suitable candidate,

454
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,145
-他早就治好你了
-切！
-he would have pursued it.
-No.

455
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:45,146
哥登医生确实是个专家，但他专的不是脑瘤而是钱
Dr. Gordon is a specialist. You know,he's making money on his speciality.

456
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,358
他是个自我主义者
He's not a thinker.

457
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,359
站在我病床边没一会工夫就开门走了
I mean, the man has his hand on the doorknob half the time that I'm there.

458
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,488
约翰，别怪我说话直，像你这么大岁数得癌症
I'm gonna be straight with you. At your age
and with the development of your cancer,

459
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,034
想治愈恐怕没有可行性。。。
it's simply not feasible for Umbrella Health...

460
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:59,035
你等会，等会，什么叫做可行性？
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's not feasible?

461
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:02,038
你通过哪位数学大师的计算方法得出这事没有可行性？
By whose mathematical equation is this not feasible? 

462
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
这是国家政策，老翰，是政策
It's policy, John. It's policy. 

463
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,797
你跳出体制去做那种公认的无效治疗
And if you go outside the system to seek out this treatment, 

464
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,798
就肯定会因为违反政策
which has been deemed ineffective,you will be in breach of policy

465
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,844
而被拒绝理赔
and you will be dropped from coverage completely.

466
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,389
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

467
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,986
你知道吗，在东方的天朝
Did you know that in the Far East,

468
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,987
人们身体健康的时候要付医生钱
people pay their doctors when they're healthy?

469
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,699
而得病则不用支付
When they're sick, they don't have to pay.

470
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,703
所以基本上那儿的人
So, basically,they end up paying for what they want,

471
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,457
是“按需付费”
not what they don't want.

472
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,002
但我们美国却正好相反
We got it all ass-backwards here.

473
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,549
这些所谓的政客，每天说着千篇一律的空话
These politicians, they say the same thing, over and over and over again. 

474
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,928
说什么“医疗对策应由医生和病人来判定
"Healthcare decisions should be made
by doctors and their patients,

475
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,266
而不是由政府来决定”
"not by the government."

476
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:04,267
得，现在我才知道
Well, now I know they're not made by doctors and their patients

477
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,895
原来都不是由这三者决定
or by the government.

478
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,065
而是他妈的保险公司
They're made by the fucking insurance companies.

479
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,572
食人鱼（金刚注：Piranha，学名水虎鱼）
Piranha.

480
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:18,573
老翰，听我说，如果你非要这么做，于你自己不利
John, please.If you do this, you'll be on your own,

481
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,746
而且随之而来的花销将是惊人的天文数字
and the subsequent cost to you will be staggering. 

482
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,747
别跟我提钱，我不差钱
Don't talk to me about money. I have money.

483
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,752
这是原则问题
This is about principle.

484
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,758
威廉，我们谈的是我的生命
You see, Will... this is my life we're talkin' about.

485
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,556
-你忘了吗？
-那么吉儿呢？
-You remember?
-What about Jill's life?

486
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,141
你去挪威谁来照顾她？
How's she going to be taken care of
when you're gone?

487
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,643
这事用不着你为我操心
You let me worry about Jill. 

488
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,644
你得的癌症既致命又不能用手术治疗 
The type of cancer you have is malignant and inoperable. 

489
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,566
这话从你嘴里不知道说几遍了
That rolled off your tongue real smooth. 

490
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,567
就算治疗起效果了，最终癌魔还是会回归
Even if the treatment works, the cancer will return eventually. 

491
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,612
-这是一场永远也打不赢的仗！
-这次的借口更圆滑了
-It's an unwinnable battle.
-That was even smoother.

492
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:01,157
实际上就是这是一种最最陈腐的思想！
As a matter of fact, that was downright slick.

493
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,703
你以为只有活人才能对你终审
You think it's the living that will have ultimate judgement over you, 

494
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,082
而死人是不会有怨言的是吗？
because the dead will have no claim over your soul.

495
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,055
侬搞错特乐！
but you may be mistaken. 

496
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,614
我操！
Oh, shit!

497
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,290
你好，威廉，已经认识到你理论中的错误了吧
Hello, William.You have seen the flaws in your policy.

498
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,628
但是你还没见过面对生死关头
But what you have not seen is the extent some people will go to

499
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,423
有一种人会达到的境界
when faced with death.

500
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,513
你单位里的那位律师
The lawyer from your firm has...

501
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,015
-黛比！
-必须在90秒时间内穿越这间游戏室
-Debbie!
-...90seconds to cross this room

502
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,016
否则，安装在她胸前的机关启动后将射爆她的脑袋
or the device attached to her chest will discharge and pierce her brain.

503
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,147
别怕，没事的！会没事的！
It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

504
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,148
穿越过程中她会遇到重重危险
She will find that the journey across this room is filled with danger.

505
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,237
为了帮助她通过此关，你也必须到达指定地点
In order for her to make it,you will need to be there for her,

506
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,950
因为你就是决定其能否生存下去的最大因素
and it is you who ultimately holds the key to her survival.

507
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,206
面对死亡，她拥有原地复活的技能吗？
When faced with death,will she have the skills to live?

508
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,502
游戏开始
Let the game begin.

509
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,924
好吧，黛比，淡定啊！
Okay. Okay, listen!

510
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,719
-你娘里个脚！这什么玩意儿！
-黛比！黛比！听我说！
-Jesus Christ! What the fuck is this?
-Debbie! Debbie! Listen to me!

511
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,720
-黛比！没事的，听我说！黛比！
-这什么啊？！
-Debbie! Okay, Debbie, listen to me! Debbie!
-What is this?

512
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,433
-快放老娘出去！
-尽快穿越这个迷宫
-Get me the fuck out of here!
-Get through the maze

513
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,017
听我说，尽快穿过去！
as fast as you can. Listen to me!

514
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,061
-快放我出去！！
-黛比！
-Get me out of here!
-Debbie!

515
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,062
你要以最快速度穿过这个迷宫！听见没！快去吧！快啊！
Okay. You've got to get through this maze
as fast as you can! Go! Move now! Go now!

516
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:03,112
加油！你能行的！你能行的！一直往前走！上吧！
Come on! You can make it! You can make it!
You got to keep moving! Go!

517
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,742
-威廉！这太疯狂了！我不敢！
-加油！你一定可以的！
-Will, this is insane! I can't!
-Go! You can make it!

518
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,787
加油啊！你可以的！动起来！别停下来！
Come on! You can make it!You've got to keep moving!

518
00:54:16,054 --> 00:54:17,206
（替她解围）

519
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,006
坚持一会！我来帮你！
Wait a minute!I think I can help you up here!

520
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:23,007
可能这样可以停下来！
Maybe this will stop it!

521
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,680
好的！好的！
Yes! Yes!

522
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,141
再来啊！有效果了！这招有用！
Do it again! It worked! It worked!

523
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:33,142
-再来！这个有用！这个好！
-好！准备好没！
-Do it again! It worked, it worked, it worked!
-Okay! Ready?

524
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,353
-好了！
-走！
-Yes!
-Go!

525
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,538
继续冲，别停下！继续冲！继续冲！继续冲！
Keep moving! Don't stop!Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

526
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,085
别歇着！
Don't stop!

527
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,422
继续冲啊！继续往前！冲啊！冲！
You gotta keep going! Keep going! Go! Go!

528
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,843
继续冲！冲冲冲！
Keep moving! Go! Go! Go!

529
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,349
冲你娘里个脚啊！妈的是个陷阱！我过不去！
Fuck, I can't! It's a fucking trap!
There's no way out!

530
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,813
妈B！这是个陷阱！我过不去！
It's a fucking trap! I can't!

531
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,692
不，不！前面有个梯子！走到那下边！我帮你！
No! No, there's a ladder at the end!So just go under! I'll help you!

532
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,492
准备好没？
Ready?

533
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,162
冲！
Go!

534
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,808
上帝啊！加油啊，黛比，上啊！爬上来！爬上来！
God! Come on, Debbie, go! Climb! Climb!

535
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,189
加油！加油！就快到了！就快到了！
Come on! Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there!

536
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:07,405
快！快！快！
Go! Go! Go!

537
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:10,406
好了，快找钥匙！这里应该有把钥匙！找钥匙！
Okay, look for a key.There's got to be a key! Look for a key!

538
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,496
什么？
What?

539
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,584
你还在等什么！
What are you waiting for?

540
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,878
-是你！
-纳尼？！
-It's in you.
-What?

541
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,879
-狗日的在你肚子里！
-我操！
-It's fucking inside you!
-Oh, fuck!

542
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,383
好吧，好吧，我来取，你干吗！
Okay. Okay, I can do this. Wait!

543
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,973
-你这臭娘们儿作死啊！
-老娘要的是钥匙！
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I need that fucking key!

544
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,495
我会取的！我会取出来的！我会取出来的！
I can get it! I can get it! I can get it!

545
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,960
天那！不！！天那！
God! No! God! No!

546
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,698
你好，帕梅拉
Hello, Pamela.

547
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,160
今天，你将体会到“牺牲”的意义
Well, today you will experience the meaning of sacrifice.

548
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,456
目睹那些害人虫的下场
And you will see the consequence for those who unjustly hurt others.

549
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,169
册那娘扎B！
Fuck!

550
00:57:48,169 --> 00:57:52,169
“启动它”

550
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,525
肯定有人在那边在监视咱们
Someone's there. They're watching us.

551
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,736
为什么？这是为什么呢？
Why? Why would someone do this?

552
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,325
想看我们的反应
To see how we respond.

553
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,326
他们想知道我们会做什么决定
They want to know what decision we'll make.

554
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,080
-我们推手闸吧
-不行！我们还不知道会发生什么！
-Let's pull it.
-No! We don't know what it does yet.

555
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,584
太冒险了
It's too risky.

556
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:32,715
操！
Fuck!

557
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,681
嘿
Hey.

558
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,350
-来了啊，辛苦
-发现什么线索？
-Thanks for coming in.
-What'd you find?

559
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,644
-关于小斯指纹的一个疑点
-是什么？
-An abnormality in Strahm's fingerprint.
-What?

560
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,645
去看看吧
Take a look.

561
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,734
人体的指纹会留有污渍
See, the human fingerprint leaves an oily residue

562
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:52,111
沾有何种残渣，取决于在何种
Depending on how long it's been exposed to the elements

563
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,112
-外部环境中，暴露了多长时间
-那么有什么问题吗？
-it's highly susceptible to contamination.
-So what's the problem?

564
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:58,115
我们在小斯的指纹中发现了“制冷剂R-12”
Well, we found trace amounts of Halomethane R-12. 

565
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,578
就是“氟利昂” 
She means Freon

566
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:03,039
1994年以来国家规定停止使用制冷剂R-12，
Production of R-12 ceased in 1994, 

567
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,040
所以问题是： 氟利昂是案发现场原本就存在的呢
So the question is, was the contaminant
we found at the site already

568
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,711
还是小斯带过去的
or did Strahm bring it in with him?

569
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,588
我们在深入调查那幢房子
We're looking into the building's function 
570
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,589
废弃之前的情况
before it was abandoned.

571
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,427
接个电话
Excuse me.

572
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:19,305
塞斯・巴克斯特的录像带有没查出来什么？
Did anything come off of the Seth Baxter tape? 

573
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,306
哦，对，我估摸着快好了吧 
Uh, yeah, actually. We might be on to something. 

574
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,268
塞斯的那盘带子很旧了
The tape was in pretty rough shape
when we found it,

575
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,978
不过还是可以进行分析
but we were able to authenticate it.

576
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,979
带中声音被刻意做得很混沌，但已确定和老头的声音不匹配
The voice was intentionally distorted,but it didn't match John Kramer's.

577
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:33,525
-技术组正在进行识别 
-识别什么？
-It's currently being analyzed.
-For what?

578
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,737
声纹识别，将变声还原成原声
Well, we're trying to descramble the tape
to find the original voice.

579
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,866
老埃正在跟技术组的人联系
He's on with the tech right now.

580
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,662
你约了其他事么？你的表。。。
You timing something? Your watch. 

581
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,875
哦，没有，来这之前的事了
Oh, I was before I got your call. 

582
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,004
有信儿了！这下证据确凿了！ 
We got it. This is our smoking gun.

583
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,467
技术组说结果快出来了，走吧
The lab's off-site. Come on.

584
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,346
-你也一块去对吧？
-当然
-You're coming, right?
-Of course.

585
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,009
你可拉倒吧！你每次就知道充大头！
You shut up! All you do is try to take over every situation.

586
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,680
瞎吵吵什么玩意儿！
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about!

587
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,265
你他妈再说一个？
Shut the fuck up!

588
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,266
-滚犊子！
-你们俩都把嘴给我闭上行不！
-Fuck off!
-Would you two just shut up already!

589
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,061
慢慢想办法
We can figure this out.

590
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,062
-嘿！谁在里面！
-盾哥？是你吗盾哥？
-Hey! Who's in there?
-Mr. Easton? Is that you?

591
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,649
-是我，是西尔比吗？你和谁在一起？
-盾哥！
-Yeah- Shelby? Who's in there with you?
-Mr. Easton!

592
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,612
我们6个都在这，哥，这是怎么一回事？？
We are all here, sir, all 6.
What the hell is going on?

593
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,197
大家都在，我们需要你的帮助！
Everybody! We need your help.

594
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,866
你们看见什么了？
What can you see?

595
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,867
啥也没见着啊，这儿黑忽忽的
We can't see anything. It's pitch dark.

596
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:08,328
-内是什么声音？
-不道啊，好像是金属的声音
-What's that sound?
-I don't know, something we're chained to.

597
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,540
-为什么我们在转悠？
-快放我们出去！ 
-It's spinning. Oh, God.
-Get us out of here!

598
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,628
-快来救我们！
-求你了！
-You have to help us!
-Please!

599
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,629
快啊！盾哥！救我们出去！
Come on, get us out of here, Mr. E!

600
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,182
盾哥！
Mr. Easton!

601
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,183
盾哥！你要救我们出去的啊！
Mr. Easton! You got to get us out of here!

602
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:32,561
我地妈！
Oh, my God!

605
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,277
盾哥！盾哥！
Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton!

606
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,071
求您救我们出去！求求你了！
Please! Please get us out of here! Please!

607
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:44,072
盾哥，这到底怎么回事？！
Mr. Easton, what is this?

608
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,578
这是场游戏
It's a game.

609
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,579
游戏？什么鸡吧游戏？！
game?

610
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,424
你好，威廉，面前这六位是你最得力的干将
Hello, William. Before you are six of your most valuable associates,

611
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,721
“找漏洞六人小组”
the ones who find errors in policies.

612
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,476
他们钻的空子导致三分之二的索赔申请
Their findings result in over two-thirds

613
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,477
或最终驳回，或过早中止
of all applications denied or prematurely terminated.

614
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:17,606
现在轮到你对他们进行分析了，找出他们这些人的“漏洞”
Now you must apply your analysis to them.
And will you be able to find their errors?

615
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,446
六人骑木马
Six ride the carousel.

616
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,701
只许二人下
But only two can get off.

617
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,704
究竟选哪个？由你来选择
The decision of which two survive falls upon you.

618
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,667
规则第一项
But remember.the mounted gun will continue to fire

619
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:40,671
六轮开六枪
until all six rounds are spent.

620
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,757
行动须趁早，团灭不得鸟
And if no decision is made on your part,all six will perish.

621
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,804
啥？啥玩意儿？
What? What?

622
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,889
救人先推手
To offer the two reprieves,

623
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,890
盒中按电钮
you must press both buttons at once in the box before you.

624
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,478
若为自由故，两手皆抽搐
However, in doing so you'll give a sacrifice of your own.

625
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,859
二人生，四人死
Two can live, four will die.

626
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,860
鲜血即标尺
Your decision's symbolized by the blood on your hands.

627
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,412
盾哥！别愣着啊！侬要救阿拉册七的呀！
Wake up! You've got to get us out of here!

629
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,251
救我吧！我是该下马的那一个！
Listen to me! I am the one who should live.

630
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,380
卧槽。。。
Fuck!

631
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,262
草泥马！！
Jesus Christ! 

632
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:31,263
求求你！盾哥！求求你！盾哥！
Please! Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton! Please!

633
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,183
求你了！盾爷！救我啊！！快按那按钮！！救我！
Please! Follow policy, Mr. Easton!  Follow the policy! Please! 

634
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,312
求你了！盾爷！救我啊！！快按那按钮！！救我！
Please! Follow policy, Mr. Easton!  Follow the policy! Please! 

636
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,491
-不！
-我的天那！
-No!
-Oh, my God!

637
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,869
什么玩意你说！
What the fuck!

639
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,999
盾哥！你不是经常说“百密必有一洞”么！
You always said we're only as strong as the weakest link!

640
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,503
我找的漏洞最多！不能让我死！
I'm the strongest! You can't let me die! 

641
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,504
死去！我最健康！我身体倍儿棒！
Fuck him!I'm healthy, sir. I'm healthy! Please!

642
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,884
盾哥！快啊！
Mr. Easton, come on!

643
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,885
我有两个孩子！您见过的！
No, I have two kids.You know them well. 

644
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,597
我要是死了，他们怎么办！孩子们需要我！！
Please, they can't get on without me! They need me! 

645
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,357
我日！
Oh, shit!

646
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,664
谢谢。。。谢谢
Thank you! Thank you!

647
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,250
-操你个蛋！
-谢谢！
-Fucking hell!
-Thank you.

648
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,251
干嘛选她！你根本不了解她！盾哥！
Why her?! You don't even know her! Mr. Easton! 

649
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,049
听我说好么？我父母都有病。。。
Listen to me, okay?My parents are sick, okay?

650
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,343
-他们要靠我照顾，他们只能靠我了！
-别搁那装人了！
-They need me. I'm all they have, please!
-You fucking liar!

651
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:51,762
-你爹妈恨你！早和你断绝关系了！
-纳尼？！
-Your parents hate you! They cut you off!
-What?

652
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,763
-拉倒吧！装什么玩意儿装！
-装你妈逼，是真的！你这人怎么这样！
-Shut up! That's not true!
-Fuck you, it is true. I sit next to you!

653
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:58,016
-我。。我怀孕了，我怀孕了！
-扯你个鸟淡！她在扯淡！
-I... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant!
-No, she's not! She's lying!

654
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:00,646
-她是个大忽悠！盾爷，别信她鬼扯！
-操你！
-She's fucking lying!
-Fuck you!

655
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,606
-盾哥，她在骗你！
-我真的怀孕了！
-Mr. Easton, she is lying!
-I'm pregnant!

656
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:05,275
-她撒谎！
-没有！妈的，真没有！
-She's lying.
-No! No, fuck!

659
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,784
快点，快点，求你了！
Please! Please! Push the thing! 

662
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,169
快按啊！
Push it!

663
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,170
靠！
Oh, God! What the...

664
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,468
他妈个B！
What the fuck!

666
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,139
盾哥！我家里钱多多！
Mr. Easton! My parents are loaded!

667
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,393
只要你救我，想要多少都给你！
They'll give you whatever you want!

668
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,686
-你说个数！
-他是个小偷！
-Just say a number!
-He's a thief!

669
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,729
这些年不知道偷了公司多少钱！
He's been stealing from the company for years!

670
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,730
是真的！是真的！是真的！
It's true! It's true! It's true! 

671
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,235
-小偷！
-草泥马！
-Thief!
-Fuck you!

672
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:50,654
别信他们！
Don't listen to them!

673
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,574
-别听他们的，盾哥！
-是真的！
-Don't listen to them, Mr. E!
-It's true!

674
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:56,575
上帝啊，盾哥！快按啊！盾哥！
Christ! Mr. Easton, come on! Mr. Easton...

675
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,920
盾爷，听我说！我对你一片忠心！我来帮你选哪个！ 
Okay, Mr. Easton, listen to me carefully.
I'm on your side, and I can help you.

676
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,718
-不要相信这个婊子！ 
-嘛玩意儿？！
-But you cannot trust this bitch!
-What? Fuck you!

678
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,475
她在骗你！别信她！
You cannot believe her.She has already tried to lie!

679
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:25,187
她过去骗你，现在骗你，将来还会骗你的！
And she's just going to continue to do it!You know it!

680
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,733
救我啊，我是约什
It's me, Josh!

683
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:41,036
不不！求你了！别让我死！别杀我！ 
Please don't let me die! Please don't let me die! Don't kill me! 

684
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:50,629
操！
Fuck

685
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:01,181
佛祖啊！
Oh, God!

686
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,353
谢谢！
Thank you!

687
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,941
好啊，原来是这么回事！这就结束了是吧！
Oh, well that's it, isn't it?! It's over! 

688
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:14,653
-你这王八蛋！
-You motherfucker! 
-不要。。。
-Stop it... 

689
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,906
你这见色忘义的大烧饼！我操你妈个B！
You spineless, pussy-whipped MOTHERFUCKER!

690
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,411
就这么着了是吧！这2个骚货瞎吹都信！
That's all it takes, huh?! 
A bitch says one thing and it's all over!

691
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,250
知道吗！屎盾！你的那些理论，都是狗屎！！
You know what, William?Your policy, it's bullshit!

692
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,590
都是大便！！！
Fucking bullshit!

693
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,591
你个逼养给劳资听着
Well, you listen to me, you son of a bitch!

694
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,970
劳资为你做牛做马！
I did everything for you.

695
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:47,352
抬起头来！！敢做不敢当么！！
Look at me!When you're killing me, you look at me!

696
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,785
谢谢你。。。
Thank you.

697
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,915
上帝啊
Oh, my God!

698
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,916
-谢谢你。。
-爱米粒。。。
-Thank you.
-Emily.

699
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,775
感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

700
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,529
感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

701
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,283
感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

702
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,454
感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

703
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:52,167
-进展如何？
-挺顺利
-How's it going?
-Good.

704
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,631
就这儿
This is it. 

705
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,174
这盘录像带的制作者使用的是
Whoever made this tape had access to 

706
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,926
一套极其高端的音频绿坝设备
some very impressive audio filtration equipment.

707
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:02,721
感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

708
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:05,722
幸好我们有相关对策
Fortunately, we have some tricks of our own, here.

709
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,725
我可以倒置他的程序，如此逐步解出原声
I can turn his algorithm upside-down and let us hear what he really sounds like. 

710
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:16,107
让我们听听当前破解出的
Let's hear what you got. 

711
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,278
感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

712
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,368
-你没事吧？
-You okay? 
-啊？
-Huh? 

713
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,953
貌似有点心神不宁？
You seem a little preoccupied.

714
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:29,954
我只是急着想听到声音
I'm just anxious about the tape.

715
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,751
感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

716
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,632
-感到很无助吧
-晓得伐，我还有很多事情
-Right now, you're feeling helpless.
-You know, there are still a couple of things

717
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:41,633
-没整明白
-感到很无助吧
-I can't quite wrap my head around.
-Right now, you're feeling helpless.

718
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:45,387
比如，小斯的动机是什么？
Like, I don't understand Strahm's motivation.

719
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,141
我和他搭档5年了
He was my partner for five years. 

720
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,435
我们都知道他是个急性子
I mean, we all knew he was a bit of a hothead

721
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,436
可是从他身上看不出任何变态行为的迹象
but I never saw any indication of psychotic behavior. 

722
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,981
虎豹不堪骑，人心隔肚皮
You can't really tell when someone's so good on the inside. 

723
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:03,323
。。。无助
...helpless.

724
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,243
-听见没？
-感到很无助吧
-Hear that?
-Right now, you're feeling helpless.

725
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:07,619
就快出来了
I'm getting there. 

726
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,247
加油，我就知道你一定行
Come on. I thought you had something to show us. 

727
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:13,248
我从没想过他是报复心这么重的人
It's just I never really thought of him being vengeful.  

728
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:16,376
-感到很无助吧
-我的意思是，所有事实摆在这证明一点：
-Right now, you're feeling helpless.
-You know? I mean, all the facts are there.

729
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,135
-事情有点不大对劲
-听！很接近了
-But something doesn't sit right.
-Listen. It's getting closer.

730
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,722
-现在感到。。。
-你看有没有这种可能性
-Right now, you're feeling...
-You know, there is an alternative.

731
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,183
小斯杀塞斯・巴克斯特是为了嫁祸给你
Let's say that Strahm killed Seth Baxter

732
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,270
让我们误以为你是老头的新门徒
specifically to set you up as an accomplice
to Jigsaw.

733
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,692
有这可能
Okay.

734
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,153
但是，这里有个问题
Well, there's a problem with that, though.

735
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,238
经过对小斯指纹的进一步分析
On further analysis of Strahm's fingerprints, 

736
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,239
发现其尿酸水平
it was found that the uric acid levels
in the eccrine gland residue

737
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:49,784
与一个拥有正常硬膜代谢的人不相符
were inconsistent for an individual with an active epidermal metabolism.

738
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,291
言下之意？
In other words?

739
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,252
也就是说，小斯留下那些指纹之前
In other words, when he left his fingerprints
on the latest victim,

740
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,670
就已经死了！
Strahm was already dead.

741
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,423
-现在，感到很无助吧
-出来了！
-Right now, you're feeling helpless.
-There it is.

742
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:04,424
现在，感到很无助吧
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

743
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,159
还有谁知道这事！
Who else knows about me?

744
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,704
说！还有谁！
Who else fucking knows about me?

745
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
-人尽皆知！
-你这骗子！你这个该死的大骗子！
-Everyone.
-You lie. You're fucking lying.

746
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,547
我找到了一样你一定很想看到的东西
I found something you'll want to see.

747
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,549
就在约翰死的那个肉厂
It was at the location where John died.

748
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,550
怎么样，有帮助吧？
Does it mean anything to you?

749
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,099
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

750
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,643
离那玩意儿远点！
Get as far away from the sprinkler head
as possible.

751
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,936
我们还没弄清楚状况
We don't know what it does!

752
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,729
不能光这么坐着，要做点什么！
I'm not gonna just sit here and do nothing.

753
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,730
我们要做个决定！您明不明啊！
We need to make a decision!Don't you understand?

754
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,880
好吧，你推吧，妈妈爱你
Okay. You can pull it. I love you.

755
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:17,885
我也爱您，退后
I love you, too. Get back.

756
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:25,101
不要！你们不知道会发生什么！
No. You don't know what it does

757
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,573
-数到三，我就推
-行
-On three, I"II pull it.
-Okay.

758
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,535
不！不要啊！
No. No.

759
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,957
一，
One,

760
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,918
二，
two,

761
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:51,919
三！
three!

762
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:55,048
怎么回事？
What the fuck?

763
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,427
怎么拉了没效果？？为什么拉了没用！
It doesn't even work!It doesn't even fucking work!

764
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,723
妈的这算什么！
What the fuck?

765
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,520
不能够啊。。。
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

766
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,742
我想我知道怎么用了
I think I know what it does.

767
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:40,176
你得习惯我在这唠叨，因为我哪也不会去
Get used to me,'cause I'm not going anywhere.

768
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,262
你真这么认为么？
You sure about that?

769
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,686
阿曼达会辜负你
Amanda will fail you.

770
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:53,773
我们拭目以待
We'll see.

771
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,784
“阿曼达，吉儿流产那晚你和西塞在一起
"Amanda, you were with Cecil the night Jill lost Gideon."

772
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,291
去吧
Go.

773
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,588
-你还墨迹什么玩意儿？去啊！快去！
-我不知道我。。。
-What the fuck are you doing? Go. Go.
-I don't know about this.

774
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:17,465
-什么玩意儿你不知道？
-她对我们挺好的
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-She's been good to us.

775
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,591
我对你不好吗？
I've been good to you.

776
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:21,592
-我知道。。。
-求你了，求求你，去吧
-I know...
-Please, please, go.

777
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,263
疯了你
You drive me crazy.

778
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:26,264
快去啊！没用的东西！快点！快点！快！
Go on, you fucking pussy! Go! Go! Go!

779
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:31,561
-西塞！不要！
-听我说！
-Cecil! No!
-Listen to me!

780
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:44,866
“是你害死了他们的孩子”
"You killed their child.

781
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:48,035
“这事你知，我也知，所以你要按我说的去做”
"You know it and I know it,so do exactly as I say.

782
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:52,540
“杀了莲恩・戴伦，不然我就把真相告诉门主”
"Kill Lynn Denlon or I will tell John what you did."

783
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,213
这贱货根本不配活命！
She doesn't deserve to go free!

784
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,214
阿曼达，莲医生比你想像得要重要
Amanda, Lynn is more important than you know.

785
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,680
莲恩！
Lynn!

786
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,967
我成功了！我做到了！我通关了！
I made it. I made it. I made it!

787
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,681
否则，你将再也见不到你的家人
If you fail,you will never see your family again.

788
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:00,691
-你们在这干嘛？
-威廉！
-What are you doing here?
-Will!

789
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,947
帕梅拉！
Pamela!

790
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,948
我知道今个是你生日，我会补的，放心
I know it's your birthday.I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.

791
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:10,243
你的那份工作和你唯一的妹妹到底哪个重要？
Are you really standing up your sister for work? I'm your only family.

792
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:14,455
-你没事吧？
-恩
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

793
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,917
放她走！我通关了！我赢了！
Let her go! I mean it! I won!

794
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:21,212
你那狗P规则我都遵守了，放她出去！！
I followed your fucking rules!Now you let her go!

795
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,634
你这挨千刀的
You son of a bitch!

796
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:27,635
这代价我怎么担得起？你等于判了我死刑
You've just given me a death sentence.I mean, who's going to cover me now?

797
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,181
白眼狼
You just killed me.

798
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:33,182
走吧，咱们走
Come on, let's go.

799
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:40,815
你就是杀我爸爸的凶手
You're the man that killed my dad.

800
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:04,547
你好，塔拉。很抱歉把你和你儿子卷进这款游戏中
Hello, Tara. My apologies for exposing you
and your son to this kind of treatment.

801
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:10,177
但这里边是有原因的
But I can assure you,it is not without reason.

802
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:13,723
这个男人进来之前为救他人，牺牲自我
The man before you just made the sacrifices
to save the life of a loved one.

803
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:19,145
然而，他原本有机会救你的丈夫
However, when given the opportunity to save your husband's life,

804
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,483
但他没有
he chose not to.

805
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,484
现在我给你一个权力
Now you will be given the power to save a life.

806
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,613
来决定一个人的命运
Will you grant this man the opportunity to continue living?

807
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:33,119
你是愿意给仇人改过自新的机会
Or will you dispense the same death sentence

808
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,996
还是选择像当初仇人对你丈夫那样，宣判他的死刑？
he issued your husband?

809
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:37,707
是生，是死
Live or die.

810
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,708
决定权在于你
The choice is yours.

811
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,382
原来这不是我的游戏。。。
It's not my game.

812
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,183
我留了个宝箱给你，里面的东西至关重要
I'm leaving you a box today,and its contents are of grave importance.

813
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,483
塔克夫人，里面是什么？
Miss Tuck, what's in the box?

814
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,425
求你了，求你原谅我
Please. Please forgive me.

815
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,514
求求你，发发慈悲吧
Have mercy, please!

816
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,515
我丈夫遭受病魔折磨的时候他的慈悲在哪！
Did he show mercy when my husband was suffering?

817
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:47,358
约翰留给你五个信封
John left you five envelopes.

818
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,569
但第六个是给我的
The sixth one was for me.

819
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:57,785
这是他的遗愿
This is John's will.

820
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,291
观看这次恐惧！
...to watch this horror!

821
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,292
-他没办法。。。
-他当然有办法！
-He had no choice!
-He always had a choice!

822
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,548
为什么我非得这么做？不是因为我不能原谅
The reason I am doing this isn't because I can't forgive you

823
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:14,802
你对我家所做的罪行
for what you did to me.

824
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,807
而是因为
The reason I'm doing this

825
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:20,808
我不能忍受像你这种人在外头胡作非为！
is because I couldn't forgive myself for what you might do to someone else.

826
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:25,104
不。。。千万不要啊！
Please, no. Please.

827
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,691
-你再也害不了人了！
-求求你
-You will never kill again.
-Please.

828
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:33,821
求你不要
Please.

829
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,034
求求你
Please.

830
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,871
求求你
Please.

831
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:42,415
求你了！求求你了！
Please. Please.

832
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:45,416
不成。。。我下不了手。。。
I can't. I can't kill him.

833
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,341
我来！
But I can.

834
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:55,342
-不，布伦特！
-你杀了我爸，你个小逼养！
-No, Brent!
-You killed my father, you motherfucker!

835
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:03,517
下地狱去吧！
Now you burn in hell.

836
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:33,797
游戏结束
Game over.

837
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,724
-约翰・克莱默
-威廉・伊斯盾
-John Kramer.
-William Easton.

838
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:44,725
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

839
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:54,902
-我是按规矩办事，哈罗德
-你等于判了我死刑
-Those are the rules, Harold.
-You've just given me a death sentence.

840
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:57,947
这么说来在某种程度上你能选择谁生谁死
So, in a sense,you choose who lives or dies.

841
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,624
不！！
No!

842
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,625
这是国家政策，老翰，是政策
It's policy, John. It's policy.

843
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:18,175
你以为只有活人才能对你终审
You think it's the living who will have ultimate judgment over you,

844
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,888
而死人是没有怨言的
because the dead will have no claim over your soul,

845
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:30,062
你错了
but you may be mistaken.

846
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:42,366
你什么时候玩游戏啊？警官
So when's your test, Detective?

847
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,912
-我不需要玩
-哦？是吗？
-I don't need one.
-Oh, yeah?

848
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:57,214
应该晓得为什么你会在这吧?嗯?
You know why you're here, don't you?

849
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:04,096
我想知道你是否有资格活下来
I want to know if you have what it takes to survive.

850
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,685
你觉得可以掌控局势了是吗？
You feel you now have control, don't you?

851
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,686
你以为不经过考验就太平了？
You think you will walk away untested.

852
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:28,621
你就那么崇尚暴力吗？马克
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

853
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,918
我只是在了结约翰最后的遗愿
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

854
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:35,919
想要机会吗？我来给你一个机会
You want a chance? I'll give you a chance.

855
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:15,260
记住。。。
Remember...

856
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:18,261
记住。。。
Remember...

857
01:31:21,407 --> 01:31:25,907
不要相信那个来救你的人
Don't trust the one who saves you.

858
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,285
不要相信那个来救你的人
Don't trust the one who saves you.

859
