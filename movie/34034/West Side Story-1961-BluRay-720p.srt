2
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,014
Watch this shot. Whoa!

3
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,045
Shoot, man. Go!

4
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:04,698
Yeah!

5
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:25,006
Heh-heh!

6
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:47,115
Huh!

7
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:48,367
Gee!

8
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,444
Hey, chickie! Chick, chick, chick!

9
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,612
Jet Boy! Hey, Jet Boy!

10
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:19,542
Jet, Jet, Jet!

11
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,148
Beat it!

12
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,206
Jets, get outta here!

13
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:03,171
Hey, Snowboy! Yeah!

14
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,876
Hey!

15
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:13,888
Come on.

16
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:24,815
Beat it!

17
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,864
Chico! Chico!

18
00:11:34,997 --> 00:11:36,706
Olé, chico! Olé!

19
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,499
OK, here we go.

20
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:16,161
Jets! Hey, Jets!

21
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,547
Cracko, Indio!
Let's check him, come on!

22
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:46,562
Mío, mío, mío!

23
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:48,734
Hey, Jets!

24
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,579
Ándale, chico! Ándalelele!

25
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,581
Jets, come on!

26
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,749
Hey, Jets!

27
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:04,123
Hallo!

28
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,005
Jets, come on! Por aquí!

29
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,176
Come on!

30
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:21,939
Come on, boys, huh?

31
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:25,106
Hey, come on, huh?

32
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:12,987
Jets!

33
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:23,123
Jets! Jets!

34
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,537
Aagh!

35
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:48,605
Break it up, you punks!

36
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:49,731
Cut it out!

37
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,771
Come on, break it up, I said.

38
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:53,103
Come on. Break it up!

39
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,354
Come on!

40
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,780
How many times have I told you
punks to cut this stuff out?

41
00:14:56,911 --> 00:15:00,954
- Why, if it ain't Lieutenant Schrank!
- Top o' the day, Lieutenant Schrank!

42
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,415
- And Officer Krupke!
- Top o' the day, Officer Krupke!

43
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,287
I'll give you the top o' the head!

44
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,582
Hey you! Get down.

45
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,041
But we're having such fun.

46
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:10,453
We enjoy the playground.

47
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,682
It keeps us deprived children
off the foul city streets.

48
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:16,360
- Shut up!
- And born like we was on the hot pavement!

49
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,480
You wanna get your skull broke?

50
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:21,468
Hey, Baby John, come here!
Come here!

51
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,645
All right.

52
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:29,940
Which one of these Puerto Ricans
bloodied you? Huh?

53
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:31,812
Well, sir...

54
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:33,321
Which one?

55
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:35,487
Excuse me, sir.

56
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:37,407
As a matter of fact, er...

57
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,073
we have suspicion
that the job was done by a cop.

58
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,996
- Two cops.
- At the very least.

59
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:43,368
Impossible.

60
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:46,500
In America, nothing is impossible.

61
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:49,000
All right, wise guys.

62
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,169
Now, you listen to me.

63
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:52,673
All of you!

64
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,338
You hoodlums
don't own these streets...

65
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,589
and I've had all the roughhouse I'm
gonna put up with around here!

66
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:00,761
You wanna kill each other?

67
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,643
Kill each other.
But you ain't gonna do it on my beat.

68
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,809
- Are there any questions?
- Yes, sir.

69
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:09,189
Would you mind
translating that into Spanish?

70
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:15,108
Get your friends out
of here, Bernardo...

71
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,778
and stay out.

72
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:24,244
Please.

73
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:28,040
OK, Sharks.

74
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:30,208
Vámonos.

75
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:41,548
Boy, oh, boy.

76
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,766
As if this neighbourhood
wasn't crummy enough.

77
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,521
Now, look, fellas. Fellas!

78
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:50,806
Look, let's be reasonable, huh?

79
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:53,398
If I don't get some law and order here...

80
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:55,900
I get busted down to a traffic corner.

81
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,402
Your friend don't like traffic corners.

82
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:02,911
So that means you're gonna start
making nice with the PRs from now on.

83
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,661
I said nice, get it?

84
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,415
Cos if you don't...

85
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:13,126
and I catch any of you
brawling again in my territory...

86
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:16,460
I'm gonna beat
the living crud out of each of you...

87
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:19,677
and see that you go
to the can and rot there!

88
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:24,137
Say goodbye to the nice boys, Krupke.

89
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:26,889
Goodbye, boys.

90
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,557
Goodbye, boys.

91
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:35,065
Jail? Gee!

92
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,318
You hoodlums don't own the streets.

93
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,021
- Go play in the park.
- Keep off of the grass.

94
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,696
- Get out of the house.
- Keep off the block.

95
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:44,406
Keep off the world.

96
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,827
A gang that don't own
the street is nothin'!

97
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:49,033
We do own it!

98
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,159
Come on, Jets. Round up.

99
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,086
Not you, Anybodys. Beat it!

100
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,372
Riff, you've gotta let me in the gang!

101
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,832
Didn't you just see me? I was smash!

102
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,712
I'm a killer, I wanna fight!

103
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,466
How else is she gonna
get a guy to touch her?

104
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,135
- You dirty rat!
- The road, little girl, the road!

105
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,643
Beat it!

106
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,222
Ah, beat it!

107
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,186
OK, come on.

108
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,362
OK, now, listen.

109
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:21,573
We fought hard for this turf
and we won't give it up.

110
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,156
The Emeralds claimed it
and we shut 'em out.

111
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,955
The Hawks tried
and we knocked 'em down the cellar.

112
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,654
- The PRs are different.
- They multiply.

113
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:30,788
They keep coming.

114
00:18:30,918 --> 00:18:33,456
- They eat all the food.
- Breathe all the air!

115
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:35,413
Help, I'm drowning in tamales!

116
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,422
You heard Lieutenant Schrank.

117
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,753
We gotta make nice
with them Puerto Ricans, or else!

118
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:45,383
Are we gonna let 'em move in
and take it all away from us, or else?

119
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,509
You're damn right, no.

120
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,050
So what are we gonna do, buddy boys?

121
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:52,227
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

122
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:53,851
We're gonna speed fast.

123
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,023
We're gonna move like lightning!

124
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:59,272
We're gonna clean them Sharks up
once and for all...

125
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,739
so they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again.

126
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:06,070
And we're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.

127
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,446
- A rumble!
- Now, cool, Action Boy.

128
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:12,329
The Sharks want
a piece of this world too.

129
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,500
And they're real down boys.

130
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,253
They might ask for er...

131
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:17,958
blades, zip guns.

132
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,418
Zip guns?

133
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,093
Well, gee!

134
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:24,504
I ain't finalisin' and saying they will,
Baby John.

135
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:26,678
I'm just saying that they might.

136
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,847
And we've gotta be prepared.

137
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,809
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

138
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,349
I say, go, go!

139
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,141
- I say mix!
- I say sock 'em!

140
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,555
- Tear 'em!
- Yeah!

141
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,520
But if they say blades or guns?

142
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:40,776
I say let's forget the whole thing.

143
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:42,945
- What?
- What do you say, Riff?

144
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:46,483
I say this turf is small...

145
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,445
but it's all we got, huh?

146
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,035
I want to hold it
like we always held it...

147
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,205
with skin!

148
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:55,915
But if they say blades...

149
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:58,003
I say blades.

150
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,376
If they say guns...

151
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,132
I say guns.

152
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,881
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one.

153
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:05,175
To sail!

154
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,503
To hold the sky!

155
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,182
Then rev us off! Voom va-voom!

156
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,431
- Cracko jacko!
- Diga diga dum.

157
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,138
OK, cats, we rumble.

158
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,385
Now!

159
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:17,436
Protocolity calls for a war council
with the Sharks to set it all up.

160
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,105
I will personally give
the bad news to Bernardo.

161
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:22,775
- You gotta take a lieutenant.
- That's me.

162
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,863
- That's Tony.
- Who needs Tony?

163
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,071
We need Tony.

164
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:28,775
His rep is bigger
than the whole West Side.

165
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,406
He don't belong no more.

166
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,784
Now, cut it, Action!

167
00:20:32,374 --> 00:20:34,414
Me and Tony started the Jets.

168
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:35,539
So where is he?

169
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,247
How come he takes a lousy job?

170
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,122
Youth Board corrupted him.

171
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:41,498
- Temporary sickness!
- Wait and see.

172
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,875
Them fists when we beat the Emeralds!

173
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:47,177
- He saved my ever-Iovin' neck.
- He'll do it again.

174
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:50,023
He always came through for
us, and he always will.

- Tony, you're not listening.
- I hear you, Riff.

234
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:55,595
Then why don't you answer?

235
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:58,681
I don't want to hurt you.
You're my best friend.

236
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:00,853
Womb to tomb?

237
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:02,977
Birth to earth!

238
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:05,731
That's why you gotta come
to the dance tonight...

239
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,404
and stand up with me.

240
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,570
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.

241
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,359
Riff.

242
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:12,952
Do you ever stop to figure...

243
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:15,747
how many bubbles
are in one bottle of soda pop?

244
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,616
Tony, this is important.

245
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,908
Everything's important, Riff.

246
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:22,535
You. Me. The sweet guy I work for.

247
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:24,960
The Sharks walk bad. They bite hard.

248
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,581
If we don't stop 'em now, we'll never...

249
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:29,176
Here! Work for a living.

250
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:30,501
How do you like that?

251
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:33,389
Four years,
I live with a buddy and his family.

252
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:35,971
I think I'm digging a guy's character.

253
00:23:36,935 --> 00:23:39,770
Boy, am I a victim
of disappointment in you.

254
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:42,019
End your suffering, little man.

255
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,233
Why don't you just
pack up your gear and move out?

256
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,400
Cos your ma's hot for me.

257
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:54,073
No! No, it's cos I hate
living with my buggin' uncle.

258
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:56,990
- Come on! Come on!
- Uncle! Uncle!

259
00:23:58,207 --> 00:23:59,998
Now...

260
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,165
Go play games with the Jets.

261
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:04,334
Why not? They're the greatest.

262
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:06,088
Ain't they?

263
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:08,042
Were.

264
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:10,051
Were?

265
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:12,004
You found something better?

266
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,131
No. Not yet, but...

267
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:17,555
But what?

268
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:20,475
You won't dig it, Riff.

269
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:22,644
So try me.

270
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,813
Come on, Tony, try me.

271
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:29,771
OK.

272
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:36,076
Every single night,
for the last month...

273
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:39,370
I wake up, and I'm reaching out.

274
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:43,495
- For what?
- I don't know.

275
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,667
A dame?

276
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:48,665
It's right outside the door.

277
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,800
Just around the corner...
but it's coming.

278
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:53,967
What is?

279
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:55,923
I don't know!

280
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:58,928
It's like the kick
I used to get from being a Jet.

281
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,099
Well, now you're talking!

282
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:03,684
Man, without a gang, you're an orphan!

283
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:06,566
With a gang,
you walk in twos, threes, fours.

284
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:09,314
When your crew is the best,
when you're a Jet...

285
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:12,019
you're out in the sun,
you're home, free home.

286
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:14,778
Riff, I've had it.

287
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:18,450
Tony.

288
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:20,538
Tony, look at me, will you?

289
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,076
Come on, look at me.

290
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,248
I'm looking at you.

291
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:27,913
I never asked the time of day
from a clock, did I?

292
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,206
I never asked nothing from nobody.

293
00:25:30,341 --> 00:25:33,710
But I'm asking you...
Come to the dance tonight.

294
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:37,048
I promised Doc
I'd clean up the store tonight.

295
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,221
Then do it after the dance.

296
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:43,061
Tony, I already told the guys
you'd be there.

297
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:45,595
If you don't show,
I'll be marked lousy.

298
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,768
What time did you tell 'em?

299
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:50,941
10.

300
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:53,110
For me, Tony. For Riff.

301
00:25:57,286 --> 00:25:58,614
- 10 it is.
- Womb to tomb?

302
00:25:58,745 --> 00:26:00,784
Birth to earth! I'll live to regret this.

303
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:04,498
What you're waiting for
may be twitching at the dance.

304
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:06,619
Yeah. Who knows?

305
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:14,131

Por favor, Anita. You are my friend.

355
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:44,200
You must make the neck lower.

356
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:48,244
<i>Stop heckling me. We are working
on our time, not the old lady's.</i>

357
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:52,245
One inch.
How much can one little inch do?

358
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:54,289
Too much.

359
00:28:54,423 --> 00:28:57,257
Anita, it is now to be
a dress for dancing...

360
00:28:57,384 --> 00:28:59,091
no longer for praying.

361
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:03,679
With those boys, you can start in
dancing and end up praying!

362
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,013
Querida. One little inch.

363
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:08,681
- Un poquitino.
- Bernardo made me promise.

364
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,647
Bernardo!
One month have I been in this country!

365
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,516
Do I ever touch excitement?

366
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,142
I sew here all day.
I sit at home all night.

367
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:18,317
Why did my brother bring me here?

368
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,820
To marry Chino.

369
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:23,867
Chino.
When I look at Chino, nothing happens.

370
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,401
What do you expect to happen?

371
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:28,696
I don't know. Something.

372
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,961
What happens
when you look at Bernardo?

373
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,254
<i>It's when I don't look that it happens.</i>

374
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:42,585
I think I will tell Mama and Papa...

375
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:45,806
about you and Nardo
in the balcony of the movies.

376
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:47,890
Oh! I will rip this to shreds!

377
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:49,298
No.

378
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:52,557
But if you perhaps could manage
to lower the neck...

379
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,396
Next year.

380
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:58,099
- I hate that dress!
- Then, don't wear it.

381
00:29:58,237 --> 00:30:00,563
And don't come to the dance tonight.

382
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,737
- Don't come?
- Here!

383
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:07,284
Could we not dye it red?

384
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:09,453
No, we could not!

385
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,705
White is for babies.

386
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:16,587
I will be the only one there in a white...

387
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,839
Aaah!

388
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:28,765
- Oh, sí.
- Ah.

389
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:30,933
It is a beautiful dress.

390
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,259
I love you!

391
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:37,021
- Are you ready, ladies?
- Nardo, come in!

392
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:38,729
Is it not beautiful?

393
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,569
Ah, yes.

394
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:41,727
Very.

395
00:30:41,864 --> 00:30:43,774
Er... I didn't quite hear.

396
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,234
Ah, very beautiful.

397
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:49,701
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.

398
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,658
But this is a shop for ladies!

399
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:52,906
We won't bite you...

400
00:30:53,043 --> 00:30:54,536
till we know you better!

401
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:55,664
Chino...

402
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:58,666
keep both eyes on Maria tonight,
in case I cannot.

403
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,961
You too, Anita.

404
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,130
My brother is a silly watchdog.

405
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:04,548
Aah, my sister is a precious jewel.

406
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:09,340
What am I? Cut glass?

407
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:13,308
Nardo, it is most important
that I have a wonderful time tonight.

408
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,431
Because tonight
is the real beginning of my life...

409
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:21,060
as a young lady of America.

410
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,004
Get out of here!

411
00:32:54,748 --> 00:32:56,742
Hey, Nardo, ¿ cómo estás?

412
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,255
Come on, guys.

413
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:06,843
Maria!

414
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,008
Hey, Maria.

415
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:11,427
- Hey, look what I got.
- Hi, Consuelo.

416
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:14,262
These are some of my friends
you have not met.

417
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:17,062
- Hey. Pick up.
- How are you?

418
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:18,517
This is Loco.

419
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,059
- Mucho gusto.
- Encantada.

420
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:21,187
Teresita.

421
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:22,976
- My sister, Maria.
- Good evening.

422
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,103
- Luis Arruza.
- Encantada.

423
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:28,488
- Rosalia, hi!
- Oye, Nardo.

424
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:40,541
All right, boys and girls, all right.

425
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:42,752
Attention, please.

426
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:47,626
Attention!

427
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:51,681
- Come here.
- Let's get on with it!

428
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:55,011
My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.

429
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:56,887
It's all for you, Glad Hand.

430
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,223
I know.
I know you boys and girls are here...

431
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:03,144
because you want
to make new friends...

432
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:06,313
and get closer to old ones.

433
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,074
Tonight we're gonna do
something special.

434
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:15,325
We're gonna have a get-together dance.

435
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:17,863
Ginger-peachy!

436
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,039
All right. All right, now.

437
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:22,207
Kids, kids.

438
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,377
I want you to form two circles.

439
00:34:24,506 --> 00:34:25,502
How many?

440
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:29,083
Two. Boys on the outside
and girls on the inside.

441
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:30,214
Where are you?

442
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:33,795
All right.

443
00:34:33,932 --> 00:34:35,972
Now, er...

444
00:34:36,101 --> 00:34:38,223
When the music stops...

445
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:42,303
each boy dances with
whichever girl is opposite.

446
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,520
OK?

447
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,645
OK.

448
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:47,226
Two circles, kids.

449
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,819
Well, it won't hurt you to try.

450
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:57,238
Oo-ooh, it hurts, it hurts!

Snowboy.

452
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:45,420
That's it, kids. Keep the ball rolling.

453
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:48,037
Around she goes, and where she stops...

454
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:49,668
nobody knows.

455
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,377
All right, here we go.

456
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:57,177

00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,155
Maria.

494
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:15,785
I don't want you.

495
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:17,875
I want you, though.

496
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:28,217
I want you for a war council.

497
00:43:28,347 --> 00:43:29,722
Jets and Sharks.

498
00:43:29,848 --> 00:43:33,549
- The pleasure is mine.
- Let's go outside.

499
00:43:33,685 --> 00:43:36,852
I would not leave ladies alone
with your kind around.

500
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,020
We will meet you at midnight.

501
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,723
- Doc's candy store?
- Mm-hm.

502
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,817
And no jazz before then.

503
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,694
I understand the rules...

504
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,733
native boy.

505
00:43:49,868 --> 00:43:51,908
Ice.

506
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,825
Doc's at midnight. Spread the word.

507
00:43:58,961 --> 00:43:59,992
Right, Daddy-O.

508
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,921
Maria.

509
00:44:10,055 --> 00:44:12,013

I do not say these things
to spoil your evening...

547
00:46:47,632 --> 00:46:49,505
or to hear myself talk.

548
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:52,124
- I am here longer than you.
- Sí, Nardo.

549
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:55,013
When you are old and married
with five children...

550
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,681
you can tell me what to do.

551
00:46:56,807 --> 00:46:58,681
Now it is the other way round.

552
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:00,848
Now go to bed.

553
00:47:00,978 --> 00:47:03,018
He's the old married woman.

554
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:11,570
You know, she has a mother.
Also a father.

555
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:13,736
They know this country even less.

556
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:15,693
You do not know it at all.

557
00:47:15,826 --> 00:47:17,820
Girls here are free to have fun.

558
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:19,993
She is in America now.

559
00:47:20,122 --> 00:47:22,578
Puerto Rico is in America now.

560
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:28,129
Sometimes I don't know
which is thicker...

561
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,295
your skull or your accent.

562
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,010
- Vámonos, muchachos.
- Let them wait.

563
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:38,337
Is Maria all right?

564
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:41,808
- I should be so all right.
- It will not happen again.

565
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:44,771
Pepe, Indio!
Tonight, things will be settled.

566
00:47:44,897 --> 00:47:46,725
First, settle your stomach.

567
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:48,233
Never mind my stomach.

568
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,692
Well, I mind your nose
and your head broken.

569
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:52,935
- Broken?
- Sure.

570
00:47:53,072 --> 00:47:56,026
They use Maria for an excuse
to start World War III.

571
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:57,487
It is more than that.

572
00:47:57,618 --> 00:48:00,192
More than what? She was only dancing.

573
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:01,575
With an American...

574
00:48:01,707 --> 00:48:03,200
who is really a Polack.

575
00:48:03,332 --> 00:48:04,910
Says the Spic.

576
00:48:06,669 --> 00:48:08,710
You are not so cute.

577
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:11,163
- That Tony is.
- And he works.

578
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:12,544
A delivery boy.

579
00:48:12,675 --> 00:48:14,798
- And what are you?
- An assistant.

580
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:17,501
And Chino makes half
of what the Polack makes.

581
00:48:17,638 --> 00:48:20,675
- The Polack is American.
- Here's the commercial.

582
00:48:20,808 --> 00:48:23,135
Your mother's a Pole,
your father's a Swede.

583
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,476
You were born here,
that's all that you need.

584
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:27,644
You are an American. But us?

585
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:28,769
Foreigners!

586
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,356
Lice! Cockroaches!

587
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,684
Hey, but it's true.

588
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,691
When I think of how I
thought it would be here.

589
00:48:35,823 --> 00:48:38,742
We came like children -
believing, trusting.

590
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:40,362
With our hearts open!

591
00:48:40,495 --> 00:48:42,322
With our arms open!

592
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:44,745
You came with your mouth open.

593
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:48,408
You did
and you'll go back in handcuffs.

594
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:51,083
- I'll go in a Cadillac!
- Air-conditioned.

595
00:48:51,214 --> 00:48:53,089
- Built-in bar.
- Telephone.

596
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:55,090
And television.

597
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:58,883
If you had all that here,
why would you go back to Puerto Rico?

598
00:48:59,014 --> 00:49:02,133
Even if you didn't have all that here,
why go back?

599
00:49:02,267 --> 00:49:03,761
It's so good here?

600
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:05,352
<i>It's so good there?</i>

601
00:49:05,478 --> 00:49:07,187
We had nothing.

602
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:09,224
Ah, we still have nothing...

603
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:11,350
only more expensive.

604
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,524
- Anita Josefina... Beatriz...
- No, no. It's plain Anita now.

605
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:20,025
- Etcetera, etcetera.
- Leave me alone. At least I left.

606
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,734
Once an immigrant, always an immigrant.

607
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:25,540
Instead of a shampoo,
she was brainwashed.

608
00:49:25,665 --> 00:49:28,750
- Stop it!
- She's given up Puerto Rico...

609
00:49:28,878 --> 00:49:30,752
now she's queer for Uncle Sam.

610
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,207
Oh, no.

611
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:34,296

Hey, Chino.

What are you doing?

671
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:46,570
- Meet me on the roof later.
- Meet me on the roof later!

- Will you or won't you?

Hey!

00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:53,370
Well, will you?

675
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:56,284
You have your big important war council.

676
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,455
The council...

677
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:00,080
or me?

678
00:55:00,212 --> 00:55:02,252
First one...

679
00:55:03,549 --> 00:55:04,959

I don't wait.

683

Back home, women know their place.

684
00:55:13,516 --> 00:55:16,305
Back home, little boys
don't have war councils.

685
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:18,264
Ah, but they do here.

686
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:21,897
You want me to be an American,
don't you?

687
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:25,771
Buenas noches, Anita.

Oh! Immigrant!

693
00:55:35,956 --> 00:55:37,996
Buenas noches.

694
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,786
Ten cuidado.

695
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,491
- Buenas noches, Maria.
- Adios, Maria.

696
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:44,587
Goodnight, Maria.

697

- Maria!
- Quiet.

702
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,963
Come down.

703
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:28,965
- No!
- Maria.

704
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,427
Please.
My mother and father will wake up.

705
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,547
Just for a minute.

706
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,509
A minute is not enough.

707
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,682
- For an hour, then.
- I cannot.

708
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,140
- Then forever.
- Ssh!

709
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,646
Then I'm coming up.

710
00:56:41,772 --> 00:56:43,730
<i>Maria!</i>

711
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,442
Momentito, Papa.

712
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,193
Now see what you've done.

713
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,397
- Momentito, Maria.
- Cáilate.

714
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,860
- Ssh!
- Ssh!

715
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,862
It is dangerous. If Bernardo knew...

716
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,830
Well, let him know.
I'm not one of 'em, Maria.

717
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,996
But you are not one of us...

718
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,833
and I am not one of you.

719
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,747
- To me, you're all the beautiful...
- Maruca.

720
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,919
Sí, ya vengo, Papa.

721
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:15,094
Maruca?

722
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,216
His pet name for me.

723
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,639
I like him... and he will like me.

724
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:21,892
No.

725
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,849
He is like Bernardo...

726
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,021
Afraid.

727
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,395

00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:30,355

729
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,113

He don't even use an atomic ray gun.

- Captain Marvel.

Gee, I love him.

Too noisy!

make you do like that?

01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:00,581
- Mercy.
- Rubber hoses, maybe.

826
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:03,468
- Relax, little man.
- You tell him, Daddy-O.

827
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:05,171
- I'm ready.
- Easy! Cool!

828
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:07,131
- Chung chung!
- Cracko jacko!

829
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:08,427
Ooblee-oo.

830
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:11,761
Riff, in a tight spot,
you need every man you can get.

831
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:14,646
- No!
- An American tragedy.

832
01:04:14,772 --> 01:04:16,396
- Pow!
- Oh, poo!

833
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:18,101
Ooblee-poo.

834
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:21,235
Look, when the Sharks come,
you chicks cut out.

835
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:24,529
We might. And then again, we might not.

836
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:27,566
This ain't kids' stuff, Graziella.

837
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:30,323
I and Velma ain't kids' stuff, neither.

838
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,281
Are we, Vel?

839
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:33,661
No, thank you.

840
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:35,285
Ooh! Ooblee-ooh!

841
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:37,161
And you can punctuate it.

842
01:04:37,295 --> 01:04:38,290
Ooh!

843
01:04:39,964 --> 01:04:42,751
What are we pooping around
with dumb broads?

844
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:44,793
I and Velma ain't dumb.

845
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:46,552
Hey, the bulls!

846
01:04:49,098 --> 01:04:50,557
- Hey, you!
- Hey, who?

847
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:52,094
- Who, who?
- Who, me?

848
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:53,258
Who, her?

849
01:04:53,394 --> 01:04:55,637
Top o' the evening, Officer Krupke.

850
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:57,598
You!

851
01:04:57,732 --> 01:04:59,523
- Who? Me, sir?
- Yeah, you.

852
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,477
<i>Didn't you hear me?</i>

853
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:04,481
Yes, sir. I got 20-20 hearing.

854
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:06,108
Why didn't you answer?

855
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,731
His mother told him
not to answer back to a cop.

856
01:05:08,868 --> 01:05:12,035
- You want me to run you in?
- Indeed not... sir.

857
01:05:12,163 --> 01:05:14,120
I ought to run all yous punks in.

858
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:16,786
Why are you standing around
on the sidewalks?

859
01:05:16,918 --> 01:05:19,670
You see, sir. We're afraid to go home.

860
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:21,753
Such a bad environment.

861
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:24,586
- We don't get no love there.
- Oh, it's awful.

862
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,168
If you don't leave us stay out here...

863
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:30,423
we're liable to turn into
juvenile delinquents.

864
01:05:30,557 --> 01:05:33,131
I know yous was
cooking up something tonight.

865
01:05:33,269 --> 01:05:35,177
Yous won't put nothing over on me.

866
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:37,553
Sergeant, come on. We've got a 10-13.

867
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:39,729
Go on! Get a move on, all of yous.

868
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:42,942
Don't let me catch
none of yous here when I get back.

869
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:44,777
See you around now.

870
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:46,399
Hey, hey, hey!

871
01:05:46,531 --> 01:05:50,576
- You forgot to say goodbye.
- They ain't got no manners.

872
01:05:50,702 --> 01:05:53,407
Don't let me catch you here
when I get back.

873
01:05:53,538 --> 01:05:56,492
- They treat us like we ain't human.
- He was pretty mad.

874
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,748
So what happened? A big fat nothing.

875
01:05:58,877 --> 01:06:01,914
Suppose he comes back
while we're having the war council?

876
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:03,126
We'll snow him some more.

877
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:08,131
Cops believe all they read
in the papers about us JDs.

878
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:11,215
So that's what we give 'em!
Something to believe in.

879
01:06:11,348 --> 01:06:13,222
Hey, you!

880
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,675

01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,110
Tony?

983
01:10:37,408 --> 01:10:39,400
Doc, you ain't gonna close up now?

984
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:40,531
I'm not?

985
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:42,785
- We got a war council here.
- A who?

986
01:10:42,914 --> 01:10:46,199
To determine weapons.
We're gonna set up a mix with the PRs.

987
01:10:46,334 --> 01:10:49,289
Weapons? You couldn't play basketball?

988
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:50,999
Get with it, buster.

989
01:10:51,131 --> 01:10:54,131
You don't understand.
We got special business here.

990
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:56,631
Making trouble for the Puerto Ricans?

991
01:10:56,762 --> 01:10:59,927
- They make trouble for us.
- For you, trouble is a relief.

992
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:02,511
We gotta stand up to 'em.
It's important.

993
01:11:02,642 --> 01:11:05,644
Fightin' over a piece of street
is so important?

994
01:11:05,771 --> 01:11:07,644
- To us it is!
- To hoodlums it is!

995
01:11:07,772 --> 01:11:09,349
Who are you calling hoodlums?

996
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,226
- War councils...
- Don't start.

I'll dig you an early grave,
that's what I'll dig.

Dig, dig, dig.

OK, Doc, set 'em up. Cokes all round.

Let's get down to business.

Bernardo hasn't learned
about gracious living.

I don't like you either... so cut it.

OK, kick it, Doc.

All out, once and for all. Accept?

- On what terms?
- Whatever terms you're calling.

1012
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:53,335
- You crossed the line once too often.
- You started it.

1013

Who asked you to move here?

The river.

1023

Under the highway.

You said call weapons.

1044

- No, thank you. I don't smoke.

Evening, Lieutenant.

1059

I and Tony was just closing up.

01:15:32,373 --> 01:15:35,707
Well! Now, this is more like it, fellas.

01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:38,124
Warms me all over to see you this way.

1062
01:15:38,254 --> 01:15:42,631
And after only a couple of words
from me at the playground today.

Oh, do you mind?

I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.

Good deal all around, huh, Bernardo?

Use of the playground,
use of the gym...

1070
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:06,695
the streets, the candy store.

1071
01:16:07,951 --> 01:16:11,615
So what if they do turn
this town into a stinking pigsty?

1072

write to San Juan,
tell them how he's got it made here.

1074
01:16:18,711 --> 01:16:21,712
What I mean is... clear out, you!

1075
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,002
I said clear out!

1076

Oh, yeah, sure. I know.

Now, where are you gonna rumble?

side of the street, Action?

One day,
there won't be anyone to hold you!

Get him out of here! Come on!

1105
01:18:34,974 --> 01:18:37,891
Don't worry.
I'll find out where it's gonna be.

1106

Understand 'em.

1110

That's what they keep telling me
at headquarters - understand.

1111
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:03,039
You try keeping hoodlums in line
and see what it does to you.

1112
01:19:06,089 --> 01:19:09,789
It wouldn't give me a mouth like his.

Come on, Doc. Don't let it get you.

And that's gonna cure something?

1117

From here on in,
everything's gonna be all right.

1118
01:19:27,277 --> 01:19:30,480
- I got a feeling.
- What have you been taking tonight?

1119
01:19:30,613 --> 01:19:32,440
A trip to the moon.

1120
01:19:32,574 --> 01:19:34,401
And I tell you a secret, Doc.

1121
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:36,408
It ain't a man that's up there.

1122

It's a girl.

1123

A lady.

1124
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:44,166
Buenas noches, señor.

Tough? Doc, I'm in love.

No.

01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,753
Gracias, querida.

1140
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:19,888
Rosalia, Consuelo,
my adorable friends.

1141
01:21:20,057 --> 01:21:21,468
Can you keep a secret?

1142
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,640
I'm hot for secrets!

1143
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,185
No, I won't tell you.

1144
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:29,141
- What?
- What?

1145
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:31,102
The poor girl is out of her mind!

1146
01:21:31,235 --> 01:21:32,860
I am. Crazy!

1147
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:36,190
She might be at that.
She looks somehow different.

1148
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,897
- I do?
- And I think she is up to something.

1149
01:21:39,035 --> 01:21:40,695
I am?

1150
01:21:40,828 --> 01:21:43,498
"I do?" "I am?" She talks like a parrot.

1151
01:21:43,623 --> 01:21:45,781

01:24:31,876 --> 01:24:34,201
You want to sing,
do it with the needles...

1216
01:24:34,337 --> 01:24:36,709
or you'll be singing for your supper.

1217
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:40,089
What can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.

1218
01:24:40,218 --> 01:24:43,587
Sure. You make the bad joke
at home where I can't hear it.

1219
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:46,294
Go now, go home.
It's closing time. Shoo!

1220
01:24:46,432 --> 01:24:48,259
Buenas noches, Madam Lucia!

1221
01:24:48,392 --> 01:24:51,097
You pull down the shades,
pick up the pins...

1222
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:53,933
turn off the lights
and lock the doors.

1223
01:24:54,066 --> 01:24:56,638
Buenas noches, Anita.

1224
01:24:56,776 --> 01:24:57,772
Buenas noches.

1225
01:24:59,612 --> 01:25:01,736
Ay, the jail is open!

1226
01:25:01,865 --> 01:25:03,857
I thought she'd never leave.

1227
01:25:03,992 --> 01:25:07,610
It's hard to believe that old bag
was once a young bag like us.

1228
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:10,782
Let's go before she changes her mind
and comes back.

1229
01:25:10,915 --> 01:25:13,702
You go, querida. I will lock up.

1230
01:25:13,835 --> 01:25:15,874
- Why?
- I have work.

1231
01:25:16,004 --> 01:25:19,337
- Do it tomorrow.
- I am in no hurry.

1232
01:25:19,465 --> 01:25:23,796
I am. I'm going home now
and take a nice long bubble bath.

1233
01:25:23,929 --> 01:25:25,470
Black orchid.

1234
01:25:25,597 --> 01:25:27,305
Black orchid?

1235
01:25:27,432 --> 01:25:29,471
Mm. All over.

1236
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:31,844
I got a date with Nardo after the rumble.

1237
01:25:31,978 --> 01:25:34,101
What rumble?

1238
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,437
Oh. Well, er...

1239
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:39,188
Nardo's Sharks
and those boys at the dance.

1240
01:25:40,362 --> 01:25:42,319
<i>They fight each other tonight?</i>

1241
01:25:42,447 --> 01:25:44,487
They don't play potsy.

1242
01:25:46,535 --> 01:25:48,574
Why must they always fight?

1243
01:25:48,703 --> 01:25:50,281
You saw how they dance...

1244
01:25:50,413 --> 01:25:52,952
like they gotta get rid of something.

1245
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:54,660
That's how they fight.

1246
01:25:54,793 --> 01:25:56,832
To get rid of what?

1247
01:25:57,295 --> 01:25:59,335
Too much feeling.

1248
01:25:59,464 --> 01:26:01,173
And they do get rid of it.

1249
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,834
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours is so healthy.

1250
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:07,758
Definitely. Black orchid.

1251
01:26:18,775 --> 01:26:20,104
Buenas noches.

1252
01:26:22,405 --> 01:26:25,321
"You go, querida. I will lock up."

1253
01:26:28,285 --> 01:26:30,113
It's too early for noches.

1254
01:26:30,246 --> 01:26:32,285
Buenas tardes.

1255
01:26:32,414 --> 01:26:34,454
Gracias.

1256
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,410
Buenas tardes.

1257
01:26:36,543 --> 01:26:39,829
He just came from the drugstore
to deliver aspirin.

1258
01:26:39,963 --> 01:26:42,454
- You'll need it.
- Not us.

1259
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:45,379
We're fine. We're out of the world.

1260
01:26:45,512 --> 01:26:47,669
You're out of your heads.

1261
01:26:47,805 --> 01:26:49,714
We're 12 feet in the air.

1262
01:26:49,848 --> 01:26:51,889
Anita can see that.

1263
01:26:56,313 --> 01:26:58,353
You will not tell?

1264
01:27:00,568 --> 01:27:02,607
Tell what?

1265
01:27:02,736 --> 01:27:05,654
How can I know
what goes on 12 feet over my head?

1266
01:27:07,826 --> 01:27:11,241
You'd better be home in 15 minutes.

1267
01:27:19,712 --> 01:27:21,752
It's all right. She likes us.

1268
01:27:22,716 --> 01:27:25,253
But she is worried... and so am I.

1269
01:27:25,384 --> 01:27:28,421
- That's foolish.
- Are you going to the rumble?

1270
01:27:28,555 --> 01:27:30,594
- No!
- Yes.

1271
01:27:30,723 --> 01:27:31,719
Why?

1272
01:27:31,849 --> 01:27:34,422
- You must go and stop it.
- I have stopped it.

1273
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,850
It'll only be a fist fight between two.

1274
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,604
Any fight is no good for us!

1275
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:41,269
Everything is good for us.
We've got magic.

1276
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,441
Listen, and hear me.

1277
01:27:43,987 --> 01:27:46,062
You must go and stop it.

1278
01:27:47,406 --> 01:27:49,446
It means that much to you?

1279
01:27:49,575 --> 01:27:50,905
Yes.

1280
01:27:51,036 --> 01:27:52,695
All right, I will.

1281
01:27:53,746 --> 01:27:57,281
I believe you. You do have magic.

1282
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:59,457
Of course.

1283
01:27:59,586 --> 01:28:01,128
I've got you.

1284
01:28:03,756 --> 01:28:06,544
Tonight, after I stop the rumble,
I'll come by for you.

1285
01:28:06,677 --> 01:28:08,715
I will wait for you on the roof.

1286
01:28:08,845 --> 01:28:11,051
No. Not the roof.

1287
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,759
I'll come to your house.

1288
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:16,347
You cannot. My mama...

1289
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,560
Then, I'll take you to my house.

1290
01:28:19,689 --> 01:28:21,350
<i>Your mama? ♪</i>

1291
01:28:23,067 --> 01:28:26,271
She'll come running
from the kitchen to welcome you.

1292
01:28:26,404 --> 01:28:27,947
She lives in the kitchen.

1293
01:28:28,073 --> 01:28:30,148
Dressed so elegant?

1294
01:28:30,283 --> 01:28:31,861
I told her you were coming.

1295
01:28:31,993 --> 01:28:34,484
She'll look at your face -
try not to smile.

1296
01:28:34,621 --> 01:28:36,993
She'll say, "Skinny... but pretty!"

1297
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:39,790
She is plump, no doubt?

1298
01:28:40,585 --> 01:28:41,913
Fat.

1299
01:28:42,046 --> 01:28:45,580
I take after my mama. Delicate-boned.

1300
01:28:45,715 --> 01:28:47,423
Oh!

1301
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:50,628
Ooh! Not in front of Mama!

1302
01:28:51,805 --> 01:28:55,423
Oh! I would like to see Papa in this.

1303
01:28:55,558 --> 01:28:57,885
Mama will make him
ask about your prospects.

1304
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,016
Many.

1305
01:28:59,145 --> 01:29:01,636
- If you go to church?
- Oh, always.

1306
01:29:03,108 --> 01:29:06,193
Yes. Papa might like you.

1307
01:29:07,654 --> 01:29:09,943
May I have your daughter's hand?

1308
01:29:10,073 --> 01:29:12,031
He says yes.

1309
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,198
Gracias.

1310
01:29:14,786 --> 01:29:17,111
- And your mama?
- I'm afraid to ask her.

1311
01:29:17,247 --> 01:29:19,620
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.

1312
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:21,789
She's getting rid of a son.

1313
01:29:23,962 --> 01:29:26,002
She says yes.

1314
01:29:26,132 --> 01:29:28,172
She has good taste.

1315
01:29:28,759 --> 01:29:30,917
Here. Maid of honour.

1316
01:29:31,053 --> 01:29:33,758
Oh, that colour is bad for Anita.

1317
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:35,929
- The best man.
- That is my papa!

1318
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,725
Sorry, Papa.

1319
01:29:41,147 --> 01:29:44,266
Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb.

1320
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:46,439
Now, you see, Anita.

1321
01:29:46,568 --> 01:29:49,191
There was nothing to worry about.

1322
01:29:50,864 --> 01:29:53,865
Look. Mama's crying already.

1323
01:30:27,985 --> 01:30:29,444
I, Anton...

1324
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:31,397
take thee, Maria...

1325
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:32,907
I, Maria...

1326
01:30:33,033 --> 01:30:35,238
take thee, Anton...

1327
01:30:35,368 --> 01:30:38,037
For richer, for poorer...

1328
01:30:38,162 --> 01:30:40,203
In sickness and in health...

1329
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:44,577
To love and to honour...

1330
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:47,167
To hold and to keep...

1331
01:30:48,215 --> 01:30:51,168

1332
01:30:52,093 --> 01:30:54,632
From tomorrow to tomorrow...

1333
01:30:56,723 --> 01:30:59,011
From now to forever...

1334
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:02,889
Till death do us part.

1335
01:31:06,816 --> 01:31:08,855
With this ring...

1336
01:31:08,985 --> 01:31:11,025
I thee wed.

1337
01:31:12,822 --> 01:31:14,862

1338
01:31:15,116 --> 01:31:16,492

1413
01:37:47,012 --> 01:37:47,961
For what?

1414
01:37:49,181 --> 01:37:52,098
Well...
that's the way it's done, buddy boy.

1415
01:37:52,225 --> 01:37:54,931
Ah. More gracious living?

1416
01:37:55,062 --> 01:37:57,102
Every one of you
hates every one of us.

1417
01:37:57,231 --> 01:37:59,436
We hate you right back.
Let's get at it.

1418
01:37:59,566 --> 01:38:01,606
Sure.

1419
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:13,618
Come on, Ice. Come on.

1420
01:38:21,088 --> 01:38:22,747
Hold it!

1421
01:38:25,134 --> 01:38:27,803
Tony! Get with the gang. It's all OK.

1422
01:38:28,513 --> 01:38:30,552
- No.
- Tony, what are you doing?

1423
01:38:30,681 --> 01:38:33,801
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battles.

1424
01:38:35,394 --> 01:38:37,968
It don't take guts
if you've got a battle.

1425
01:38:38,106 --> 01:38:41,190
We ain't got one, none of us.
OK, Nardo?

1426
01:38:41,317 --> 01:38:43,274
Tony!

1427
01:38:43,403 --> 01:38:45,858
Hold it. Let's just cool it.

1428
01:38:45,989 --> 01:38:48,610
The deal is a fair fight
between you and Ice.

1429
01:38:48,741 --> 01:38:49,856
Get with the gang.

1430
01:38:49,993 --> 01:38:51,818
Mother hen protecting the baby.

1431
01:38:51,952 --> 01:38:53,744
I'll give you a battle, gallito!

1432
01:38:53,871 --> 01:38:57,205
- You've got one!
- I'll take pretty boy as a warm-up.

1433
01:38:57,333 --> 01:39:00,370
Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, gutless?

1434
01:39:00,503 --> 01:39:01,997
Afraid, chicken?

1435
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:04,169
- Cut it!
- No!

1436
01:39:05,258 --> 01:39:07,298
I don't want to, Bernardo.

1437
01:39:07,427 --> 01:39:09,301
- I'm sure!
- Now, listen to me!

1438
01:39:09,429 --> 01:39:11,468
There's nothing to fight about.

1439
01:39:11,598 --> 01:39:14,433
- The hell there ain't!
- You've got it wrong!

1440
01:39:15,226 --> 01:39:18,430
- Why can't you understand?
- What do you say, chicken?

1441
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:22,017
Kill him, Tony.

1442
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:24,475
- Come on, man.
- Afraid to fight?

1443
01:39:24,778 --> 01:39:26,817
- Come on!
- Let me see you fight!

1444
01:39:29,449 --> 01:39:31,655
Hey! He is chicken.

1445
01:39:32,744 --> 01:39:35,200
- Hey, pretty boy.
- Bernardo, listen.

1446
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:38,366
Don't! Stop.
We've got nothing to fight about.

1447
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:41,711
- Bernardo!
- You yellow-bellied chicken!

1448
01:39:41,837 --> 01:39:44,791
- Don't push me!
- You yellow-bellied Polack!

1449
01:39:58,394 --> 01:40:00,684
Riff! Riff, what are you doing?

1450
01:40:00,814 --> 01:40:02,392
Get out of here, Tony.

1451
01:40:02,524 --> 01:40:04,351
Riff, don't!

1452
01:40:04,484 --> 01:40:07,236
- Hold him.
- Ice, let me go!

1453
01:40:18,165 --> 01:40:20,203
<i>Riff, don't!</i>

1454
01:40:31,345 --> 01:40:32,341

There was no-one downstairs.

My mother and father are at the store.

I am sorry.

Very bad?

It will be easier

I did try. I don't know what went wrong.

1518
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:15,390
I didn't mean to hurt him.
I didn't want to.

1519
01:48:15,521 --> 01:48:17,561
But Riff was like my brother.

1520
01:48:17,690 --> 01:48:21,309
When Bernardo killed him...
Bernardo didn't mean it either...

1521
01:48:25,323 --> 01:48:27,364
I thought you knew.

1522
01:48:30,954 --> 01:48:32,993
I didn't come to tell you that.

1523
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:36,874
Just for you to forgive me
so I can go to the police.

1524
01:48:37,001 --> 01:48:37,997
No!

1525
01:48:38,128 --> 01:48:40,286
- It'll be easy now.
- I won't let you.

1526
01:48:40,422 --> 01:48:42,415
- I must.
- Stay. Stay with me.

- Maria, I love you so much.
- Don't leave me.

- Whatever you want, I'll do.
- Hold me.

- Oh, forever.
- Tighter.

It's everything around us.

Come on!

1560
01:52:03,043 --> 01:52:05,498
I don't want the guys to see me, A-rab.

1561

Why not?

1562
01:52:08,257 --> 01:52:10,296
Well, I'm crying.

1563
01:52:10,759 --> 01:52:12,798
You are?

1564
01:52:13,887 --> 01:52:15,928

A-rab?

1568
01:52:26,692 --> 01:52:28,269
Yeah?

1569
01:52:28,402 --> 01:52:30,442
Did you get a look at their faces?

1570
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:35,156
- Which faces?
- You know.

1571
01:52:35,284 --> 01:52:37,443
At the rumble. Riff and Bernardo.

1572
01:52:43,166 --> 01:52:45,207
I wish it was yesterday.

1573
01:52:45,336 --> 01:52:47,624
Me too. I'm scared.

1574
01:52:47,754 --> 01:52:49,794
Cut it out, do you hear me?

1575

A-rab, what are we gonna do?

Now, come on. Let's go.

1578
01:52:56,263 --> 01:52:58,672
Hey. Have you got a handkerchief first?

1579
01:52:58,808 --> 01:53:00,848
What's wrong with your sleeve?

1580
01:53:29,256 --> 01:53:32,671
- Where have you been?
- Where do you think? The Stork Club?

1581
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,627
We thought they'd nabbed you.

1582
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:37,679
- You didn't see Tony?
- No, nothing but coppers.

1583
01:53:37,806 --> 01:53:41,008
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing, he's OK. Get it?

1584
01:53:41,142 --> 01:53:42,720
All right, all right.

1585
01:53:42,853 --> 01:53:45,059
- Maybe we ought to go home.
- For what?

1586
01:53:45,188 --> 01:53:47,014
- Bet you they got him.
- Not Tony.

1587
01:53:47,148 --> 01:53:48,975
He was great. Huh, Baby John?

1588
01:53:49,108 --> 01:53:52,145
Oh, yeah!
He really come through for the Jets.

1589
01:53:52,279 --> 01:53:54,317
Just like Riff said he...

1590
01:53:56,449 --> 01:53:58,324
Said he would.

1591
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:05,875
Riff, I want Riff!

1592
01:54:06,585 --> 01:54:08,624
Come on, Graziella.

1593
01:54:10,421 --> 01:54:13,340
Gee. Nobody was supposed to get killed.

1594
01:54:14,885 --> 01:54:16,924
It just...

1595
01:54:20,933 --> 01:54:23,802
- They're gonna pay.
- Them stinkin' Sharks.

1596
01:54:23,935 --> 01:54:26,093
- Dirty fighting.
- They started it.

1597
01:54:26,229 --> 01:54:28,768
Let's finish it
and show 'em who's on top.

1598
01:54:28,899 --> 01:54:30,477
- The Jets!
- Let's do it now.

1599
01:54:30,608 --> 01:54:32,648
Ain't we had enough?

1600
01:54:32,819 --> 01:54:35,737
- Are you scared?
- Who are you calling scared?

1601
01:54:35,865 --> 01:54:38,236
- Lay off of him.
- Mind your own business.

1602
01:54:38,366 --> 01:54:40,608
Don't sound off on me! I'll hit you!

1603
01:54:40,743 --> 01:54:41,740
Knock it off!

1604
01:54:44,123 --> 01:54:46,660
Shut up, you bunch of good-for-nothings!

1605
01:54:46,791 --> 01:54:48,202
Go home where you belong!

1606
01:54:48,334 --> 01:54:50,791
Who are you calling good-for-nothing?

1607
01:54:50,921 --> 01:54:53,494
Come down, I'll put this
through your stupid face!

1608
01:54:53,631 --> 01:54:55,541
Get inside, all of you!

1609
01:55:00,972 --> 01:55:04,010
- Shut up!
- I don't have to take that from nobody!

1610
01:55:04,143 --> 01:55:06,301
The next creep who gets on my craw...

1611
01:55:06,437 --> 01:55:08,594
You'll laugh!

1612
01:55:14,737 --> 01:55:16,563
Yeah.

1613
01:55:16,696 --> 01:55:19,449
Now, you all better dig this,
and dig it good.

1614
01:55:19,575 --> 01:55:22,197
No matter who or what is eating you...

1615
01:55:22,328 --> 01:55:24,865

If we lay low,
the coppers are gonna smell fish...

1671
02:00:47,364 --> 02:00:49,986
- Hey, buddy boys!
- Aw, go wear a skirt.

1672
02:00:50,117 --> 02:00:51,777
I got scabby knees. Listen.

1673
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:54,152
We act like we've got nothing to hide.

1674
02:00:54,288 --> 02:00:56,530
Suppose they ask us about the rumble?

1675
02:00:56,665 --> 02:00:59,501
Suppose they ask you
who's looking for Tony...

1676
02:00:59,627 --> 02:01:00,825
with a gun?

1677
02:01:00,961 --> 02:01:02,372
You know something?

1678
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:05,755
- I know I gotta go get a skirt.
- Come on, Anybodys.

1679
02:01:05,883 --> 02:01:08,006
- What's the freak know?
- Plenty.

1680
02:01:08,135 --> 02:01:11,754
I figured somebody should
infiltrate PR territory and spy.

1681
02:01:11,889 --> 02:01:13,549
I'm very large with shadows.

1682
02:01:13,683 --> 02:01:16,553
I slip in and out of 'em
like wind through a fence.

1683

Is she making the most of it?!

1685
02:01:20,815 --> 02:01:22,060
OK!

1686
02:01:22,191 --> 02:01:26,141
I hear Chino tell the Sharks something
about Tony and Bernardo's sister.

1687
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:29,280
Then Chino says,
"It it's the last thing I do...

1688
02:01:29,407 --> 02:01:31,198
I'm gonna get that Polack."

1689
02:01:31,325 --> 02:01:33,698
Then he pulls out the bad news.

1690
02:01:33,828 --> 02:01:36,319
- Them PRs won't stop.
- Till we stop 'em.

1691
02:01:36,456 --> 02:01:37,701
Hold it!

1692
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:39,160
Now, listen.

1693
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:42,127
Tony come through for us.
We gotta do the same.

1694
02:01:42,253 --> 02:01:45,337
- We gotta find him before Chino does.
- And burns him.

1695
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:47,706
You cover the river.
Snowboy, go to Doc's.

1696
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:50,760
- I'll take the alleys.
- We'll take the streets.

1697
02:01:50,887 --> 02:01:52,714
- The park.
- The schoolyard.

1698
02:01:52,847 --> 02:01:54,637
- Let's go!
- Hey, what about me?

1699
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:56,887
- You?
- Uh-huh.

1700
02:01:57,018 --> 02:01:59,889
Take the shadows.
Maybe you'll find Tony there.

1701
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:01,219
Right!

1702
02:02:02,105 --> 02:02:03,766

Chino has a gun.

1789
02:08:54,482 --> 02:08:58,348
I heard the boys talking.
He's hunting for Tony.

1790
02:08:58,485 --> 02:09:00,774
He's at Doc's store, waiting for me.

1791
02:09:01,489 --> 02:09:04,608
If Chino hurts him
or touches him, I swear I'II...

1792
02:09:04,741 --> 02:09:07,066
You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo?

1793
02:09:07,202 --> 02:09:08,946
I love Tony.

1794
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:12,530
I know. I loved Bernardo.

1795
02:09:22,092 --> 02:09:24,299
- Anybody home?
- Yes.

1796
02:09:25,388 --> 02:09:27,178
Bernardo's sister, please.

1797
02:09:27,306 --> 02:09:29,215
She isn't feeling well.

1798
02:09:29,349 --> 02:09:31,390
Who is?

1799
02:09:33,979 --> 02:09:36,435
Hello, Miss. I'm Lieutenant Schrank.

1800
02:09:36,565 --> 02:09:38,974
I don't like to disturb you
just now...

1801
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:42,146
Yes. A very bad time.
If you will excuse me, please.

1802
02:09:42,279 --> 02:09:45,614
- I have a couple of questions.
- Afterwards, please.

1803
02:09:45,742 --> 02:09:47,320
I must go to my brother now.

1804
02:09:47,452 --> 02:09:49,527
- Just one minute.
- Can't you wait?

1805
02:09:49,661 --> 02:09:51,239
No!

1806
02:09:52,414 --> 02:09:55,416
Now, you were at the dance
at the gym last night...

1807
02:09:55,542 --> 02:09:57,250
Will this take very long?

1808
02:09:57,378 --> 02:09:59,417
As long as it has to.

1809
02:09:59,546 --> 02:10:01,624
Excuse me.

1810
02:10:03,008 --> 02:10:05,084
Anita, my headache is much worse.

1811
02:10:05,219 --> 02:10:07,258
Will you go to Doc's store for me?

1812
02:10:07,388 --> 02:10:09,631
Don't you people keep aspirin around?

1813
02:10:09,766 --> 02:10:11,758
This is something special.

1814
02:10:13,227 --> 02:10:15,470
Will you go for me, Anita?

1815
02:10:20,693 --> 02:10:22,936
What shall I ask for?

1816
02:10:23,739 --> 02:10:25,564
Doc will know.

1817
02:10:25,698 --> 02:10:27,821
Tell him I have been detained...

1818
02:10:27,950 --> 02:10:29,825
and can't get there right away.

1819
02:10:31,288 --> 02:10:33,576
Or I would have picked it up myself.

1820
02:10:44,217 --> 02:10:46,044
Excuse me.

1821
02:10:46,178 --> 02:10:48,253
You were asking?

1822
02:10:48,387 --> 02:10:50,261
Yeah.

1823
02:10:50,389 --> 02:10:53,226
At the gym,
your brother got into an argument...

1824
02:10:53,352 --> 02:10:55,806
because you danced with the wrong boy.

1825
02:10:58,231 --> 02:11:00,271
Yes.

1826
02:11:00,401 --> 02:11:02,439
Who was the boy?

1827
02:11:02,568 --> 02:11:04,608
Another from my country.

1828
02:11:05,697 --> 02:11:07,737
And his name?

1829
02:11:07,866 --> 02:11:09,147
José.

1830
02:11:19,043 --> 02:11:21,417
- Can't find him.
- Down in the cellar.

1831
02:11:21,547 --> 02:11:23,006
- Tony?
- Safe and sound.

1832
02:11:23,132 --> 02:11:25,752
- I found him.
- Did you warn him about Chino?

1833
02:11:25,884 --> 02:11:28,755
- Why's he in the cellar?
- To keep the mice company.

1834
02:11:28,888 --> 02:11:30,596
No sign of Chino, huh?

1835
02:11:30,723 --> 02:11:32,761
- Nothing.
- His luck.

1836
02:11:32,891 --> 02:11:35,761
I'll slip out the back
and check the alleys again.

1837
02:11:35,895 --> 02:11:37,437
- You guys, hang here.
- OK.

1838
02:11:37,563 --> 02:11:39,353
Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?

1839
02:11:39,481 --> 02:11:42,019
Upstairs,
raising getaway money for Tony.

1840
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:44,724
- Doc ain't got no money.
- His mattress has.

1841
02:11:44,862 --> 02:11:47,945
Cut the frabbajabba.
Grab some reading matter.

1842
02:11:48,073 --> 02:11:49,733
Some of you get outside.

1843
02:11:49,866 --> 02:11:52,536
If you see Chino, or those stinking PRs...

1844
02:12:03,046 --> 02:12:04,671
I'd like to see Doc.

1845
02:12:04,798 --> 02:12:06,590
He ain't here.

1846
02:12:06,717 --> 02:12:08,212
Where is he?

1847
02:12:08,344 --> 02:12:11,048
At the bank. They made
a mistake in his favour.

1848
02:12:11,179 --> 02:12:14,217
The banks are closed at night.
Where is he?

1849
02:12:14,350 --> 02:12:16,141
You know how skinny Doc is.

1850
02:12:16,268 --> 02:12:18,593
He slipped through
the night deposit slot.

1851
02:12:18,729 --> 02:12:20,556
And got stuck, halfway in.

1852
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:23,263
So there's no telling when he'll be back.

1853
02:12:25,986 --> 02:12:28,692
Buenas noches, señorita.

1854
02:12:37,415 --> 02:12:39,039
Where are you going?

1855
02:12:39,166 --> 02:12:41,205
Downstairs.

1856
02:12:41,335 --> 02:12:43,375
Didn't I tell you? He ain't here.

1857
02:12:43,505 --> 02:12:45,627
I'd like to see for myself.

1858
02:12:48,592 --> 02:12:51,049
Please.

1859
02:12:53,305 --> 02:12:56,140
Please.

1860
02:12:57,018 --> 02:12:59,058
Por favor.

1861
02:12:59,187 --> 02:13:00,977
Will you let me pass?

1862
02:13:01,105 --> 02:13:02,978
She's too dark to pass.

1863
02:13:03,107 --> 02:13:04,935
<i>- Oh, don't.
- Please don't.</i>

1864
02:13:05,068 --> 02:13:06,313
Por favor!

1865
02:13:06,444 --> 02:13:07,854
- Gracias!
- De nada!

1866
02:13:07,987 --> 02:13:10,110
- Ay, ay! Hey, mambo!
- Listen, you!

1867
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:12,992
Look, I gotta give
a friend of yours a message.

1868
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:14,529
I gotta tell Tony...

1869
02:13:14,661 --> 02:13:17,032
- He ain't here.
- I know he is.

1870
02:13:17,163 --> 02:13:19,489
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.

1871
02:13:19,624 --> 02:13:21,119
Could it be from Chino?

1872
02:13:21,251 --> 02:13:24,370
Don't you understand? I want to help.

1873
02:13:24,503 --> 02:13:26,544
Bernardo's girl wants to help?

1874
02:13:26,673 --> 02:13:28,796
Even a greaseball's got feelings.

1875
02:13:28,925 --> 02:13:30,798
- She wants to help get Tony.
- No!

1876
02:13:30,926 --> 02:13:32,504
Not much! Bernardo's tramp.

1877
02:13:32,636 --> 02:13:35,259
- Bernardo's pig.
- You lying Spic!

1878
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:37,217
- Don't do that!
- Gold-tooth!

1879
02:13:37,351 --> 02:13:39,757
- Pierced ear!
- Garlic mouth!

1880
02:13:39,894 --> 02:13:41,223
Cha! Cha-cha!

1881
02:13:41,355 --> 02:13:43,478
Cha-cha-cha!

1882
02:13:47,318 --> 02:13:49,146
Olé! Olé!

1883
02:14:03,627 --> 02:14:05,667
<i>♪ "America" ♪</i>

1884
02:14:15,471 --> 02:14:17,511
<i>Stop it!</i>

1885
02:14:21,936 --> 02:14:24,261
What are you doing there?

1886
02:14:43,209 --> 02:14:45,247
Bernardo was right.

1887
02:14:47,171 --> 02:14:48,998
If one of you...

1888
02:14:49,131 --> 02:14:52,582
was lying in the street bleeding...

1889
02:14:52,717 --> 02:14:54,960
I'd walk by and spit on you.

1890
02:14:55,096 --> 02:14:57,717
Stop her!
She'll tell Chino Tony's in the cellar.

1891
02:14:57,848 --> 02:14:59,258
Don't you touch me.

1892
02:15:02,812 --> 02:15:05,682
I got a message for your American buddy.

1893
02:15:06,565 --> 02:15:10,433
You tell that murderer
that Maria's never going to meet him.

1894
02:15:11,779 --> 02:15:14,565
You tell him
Chino found out about them...

1895
02:15:14,698 --> 02:15:16,738
and shot her!

1896
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:19,950
She's dead!

1897
02:15:24,292 --> 02:15:26,331
When do you kids stop?

1898
02:15:27,003 --> 02:15:30,169
You make this world lousy.

1899
02:15:31,173 --> 02:15:33,213
We didn't make it, Doc.

1900
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:36,758
Get out of here.

1901
02:16:07,042 --> 02:16:08,870
Maria?

1902
02:16:09,170 --> 02:16:11,377
Doc, I though I heard... You got it!

1903
02:16:11,506 --> 02:16:13,545
Yeah, I got it.

1904
02:16:14,341 --> 02:16:17,592
You're a pal.
You're the best friend a guy ever had.

1905
02:16:17,721 --> 02:16:20,471
I'll pay you back as soon as I can,
I promise.

1906
02:16:20,598 --> 02:16:22,805
- Forget that.
- Never! I couldn't.

1907
02:16:22,934 --> 02:16:25,935
You know what we're gonna do
in the country, Maria and me?

1908
02:16:26,062 --> 02:16:29,146
We're gonna have lots of kids.
We'll name 'em all after you.

1909
02:16:29,273 --> 02:16:31,231
So when you come to visit...

1910
02:16:31,359 --> 02:16:32,735
Wake up!

1911
02:16:33,737 --> 02:16:36,309
Is this the only way
to get through to you?

1912
02:16:36,447 --> 02:16:39,484
Do just what you all do?

1913
02:16:39,618 --> 02:16:41,492
Bust like a hot water pipe?

1914
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:43,030
What's got into you?

1915
02:16:43,162 --> 02:16:46,330
Why do you kids live
like there's a war on?

1916
02:16:51,254 --> 02:16:53,294
Why do you kill?

1917
02:16:57,094 --> 02:16:59,132
I told you how it happened.

1918
02:16:59,596 --> 02:17:01,838
Maria understands.

1919
02:17:02,724 --> 02:17:04,763
I thought you did too.

1920
02:17:04,892 --> 02:17:06,850
Maria understands nothing...

1921
02:17:06,979 --> 02:17:09,018
ever again.

1922
02:17:09,148 --> 02:17:11,187
There is no Maria, Tony.

1923
02:17:15,654 --> 02:17:16,603
What?

1924
02:17:17,823 --> 02:17:19,364
I can't.

1925
02:17:19,490 --> 02:17:20,486
No, no, Doc.

1926
02:17:21,492 --> 02:17:23,652
Now, tell me. What is it?

1927
02:17:24,788 --> 02:17:26,946
That was Anita upstairs.

1928
02:17:28,166 --> 02:17:30,622
Chino found out about you and Maria...

1929
02:17:30,753 --> 02:17:33,326
and he killed her.

1930
02:17:41,013 --> 02:17:42,839
No...

1931
02:17:48,604 --> 02:17:50,643
Maria.

1932
02:17:57,195 --> 02:17:59,236
Maria died?

1933
02:18:08,708 --> 02:18:09,703
Chino!

1934
02:18:10,334 --> 02:18:11,329
Chino!

1935
02:18:13,754 --> 02:18:16,080
Come and get me too, Chino!

1936
02:18:18,884 --> 02:18:20,924
Chino!

1937
02:18:23,473 --> 02:18:24,468
Chino!

1938
02:18:28,269 --> 02:18:30,309
Chino!

1939
02:18:30,438 --> 02:18:32,265
Come and get me too, Chino!

1940
02:18:32,398 --> 02:18:33,726
- Tony!
- Who's that?

1941
02:18:33,857 --> 02:18:36,693
- Anybodys. Come on!
- Get out of here.

1942
02:18:36,819 --> 02:18:38,195
Chino!

1943
02:18:38,321 --> 02:18:41,025
- Come and get me, damn you!
- What are you doing?

1944
02:18:41,156 --> 02:18:42,152
Get out of here!

1945
02:18:42,282 --> 02:18:44,323
- Chino!
- Come with me...

1946
02:18:44,452 --> 02:18:47,370
It ain't playing any more.
Can't anyone get that?

1947
02:18:47,497 --> 02:18:49,370
- But the gang!
- You're a girl!

1948
02:18:49,498 --> 02:18:51,207
Be a girl and beat it!

1949
02:18:55,338 --> 02:18:56,333
Chino!

1950
02:18:57,966 --> 02:18:59,875
Come on, Chino!

1951
02:19:00,009 --> 02:19:01,468
Get me too!

1952
02:19:01,594 --> 02:19:03,633
Chino!

1953
02:19:10,352 --> 02:19:12,393
Chino!

1954
02:19:15,191 --> 02:19:17,517
Chino! I'm calling for you, Chino.

1955
02:19:18,902 --> 02:19:20,980
There's nobody here but me.

1956
02:19:21,114 --> 02:19:23,154
Come on!

1957
02:19:23,283 --> 02:19:25,321
Please, will you?

1958
02:19:25,451 --> 02:19:27,824
I'm waiting for you.

1959
02:19:29,748 --> 02:19:32,073
I want you to.

1960
02:19:41,259 --> 02:19:43,299
Maria!

1961
02:19:44,346 --> 02:19:45,757
Tony!

1962
02:19:48,432 --> 02:19:49,382
Maria!

1963
02:19:55,564 --> 02:19:56,764
Maria!

1964
02:19:59,152 --> 02:20:00,232
Maria!

1965
02:20:27,473 --> 02:20:29,964
I... didn't believe hard enough.

1966
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:32,139
Loving is enough.

1967
02:20:32,268 --> 02:20:34,677
Not here.

1968
02:20:34,813 --> 02:20:36,853
They won't let us be.

1969
02:20:37,816 --> 02:20:40,058
Then, we'll get away.

1970
02:20:43,322 --> 02:20:45,943
- Yeah. We can.
- Yes.

1971
02:20:46,075 --> 02:20:48,317
- We will.
- Yes.

1978
02:22:13,455 --> 02:22:15,696
How do you fire this gun, Chino?

1979
02:22:15,832 --> 02:22:18,074
Just by pulling this little trigger?

1980
02:22:19,836 --> 02:22:21,959
How many bullets are left, Chino?

1981
02:22:23,214 --> 02:22:24,874
Enough for you?

1982
02:22:25,008 --> 02:22:27,047
And you?

1983
02:22:27,177 --> 02:22:28,968
All of you!

1984
02:22:29,095 --> 02:22:30,803
You all killed him!

1985
02:22:30,931 --> 02:22:33,303
And my brother. And Riff.

1986
02:22:33,433 --> 02:22:35,971
Not with bullets and guns.

1987
02:22:36,102 --> 02:22:38,225
With hate.

1988
02:22:38,355 --> 02:22:40,513
Well, I can kill too...

1989
02:22:40,649 --> 02:22:42,641
because now I have hate.

1990
02:22:42,776 --> 02:22:44,685
How many can I kill, Chino?

1991
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:46,528
How many?

1992
02:22:46,655 --> 02:22:49,027
And still have one bullet left for me?

1993
02:23:10,804 --> 02:23:12,844
Don't you touch him!

1994
02:24:07,737 --> 02:24:09,776
Te adoro, Anton.

1995
02:24:32,345 --> 02:24:34,384
