Watch this shot now!
Shoot, man! Go!

2
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,485
-Hey, chickie! Chick, chick, chick!
-Boy! Jet boy!

3
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:12,488
Hey, Jet boy!

4
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,061
Jet, Jet, Jets!

5
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,932
-Come back!
-Chickens!

6
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,085
Beat it!

7
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,000
All right, go, Jets.
Get on it.

8
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,341
Snowboy!

9
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,288
Come on.

10
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,298
Beat it!

11
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:44,209
Okay, here we go!

12
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,681
Jets! Hey, Jets!

13
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,060
Bernardo! Indio!
Let's chuck them, come on!

14
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:39,031
Jets, come on! Follow me, baby.

15
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,122
Come on, Jets, come on!

16
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:08,631
Hey, Jets!
Hello!

17
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:16,040
Jets, come on! JuIio!
Come on!

18
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:27,145
Come on, boys.

19
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:30,219
Come on, now.

20
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:18,028
Jets!

21
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:56,034
Break it up, you punks! Cut it out!
Come on, break it up, I said!

22
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,976
Break it up! How many times have I
toId you punks to cut this stuff out?

23
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:05,015
-Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank!
-Top of the day, Lt. Schrank.

24
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:08,585
-And Officer Krupke.
-Top of the day, Officer Krupke.

25
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:11,951
-I'll give you the top of the head.
-You, get down!

26
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,820
-We're having fun.
-We enjoy the pIayground.

27
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:17,929
It keeps us deprived chiIdren
off the streets.

28
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:21,066
-Shut up!
-Born Iike we was on the hot pavement.

29
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:26,035
-You wanna get your skull broke?
-Baby John, come here. Come here!

30
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:34,479
All right. Now, which one of these
Puerto Ricans bIoodied you?

31
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:38,073
-Well, sir--
-Which one?

32
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,741
Excuse me, sir.

33
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,784
As a matter of fact...

34
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:45,117
...we suspicion that the job
was done by a cop.

35
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,225
-Two cops.
-At the very Ieast.

36
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:52,126
-ImpossibIe.
-In America, nothing is impossibIe.

37
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:55,699
All right, wise guys.
Now, you Iisten to me!

38
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:59,770
All of you! You hoodIums
don't own these streets.

39
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:03,705
I've had all the roughhouse
I'll put up with around here!

40
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:08,108
You wanna kill each other,
kill each other! But not on my beat!

41
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:10,909
-Are there any questions?
-Yes, sir.

42
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,484
WouId you mind transIating
that into Spanish?

43
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:19,657
Get your friends
out of here, Bernardo.

44
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,187
And stay out.

45
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,730
PIease.

46
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,767
Okay, Sharks.

47
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:49,519
Boy, oh, boy. As if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough.

48
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,354
Now, Iook, fellas. Fellas!
Look, Iet's be reasonabIe, huh?

49
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:58,019
If I don't get Iaw and order
around here...

50
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,722
...I get busted down
to a traffic corner.

51
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,959
Your friend don't Iike traffic corners.

52
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:08,602
So that means you're gonna start
making nice with the PRs from now on.

53
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:11,499
I said nice! Get it?

54
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,574
Because if you don't...

55
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:17,773
...and I catch any of you doing
any more brawIing in my territory...

56
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:23,354
...I'll beat every one of you and see
you go to the can and rot there!

57
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:31,729
-Say goodbye to the nice boys, Krupke.
-Goodbye, boys.

58
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,359
''Goodbye, boys.''

59
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:41,632
-JaiI? Gee.
-''You hoodIums don't own the streets.''

60
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:44,139
-''PIay in the park.''
-''Keep off the grass.''

61
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,210
-''Leave the house!''
-''Off the bIock.''

62
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,210
-''Get out of here.''
-''Off the worId!''

63
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,009
A gang that don't own
the street is nothing!

64
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:52,741
We do own it!

65
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,686
Come on, Jets, round up!

66
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:59,918
-Not you, Anybodys! Beat it!
-Riff, Iet me in the gang!

67
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:03,892
Didn't you see me? I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.

68
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,623
How eIse will she get
a guy to touch her?

69
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,962
-You dirty rat!
-The road, IittIe girI! The road!

70
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:11,125
Beat it!

71
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:16,103
-Beat it!
-Okay, come on.

72
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:26,507
Now, we fought hard for this turf,
and we ain't just gonna give it up.

73
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:31,645
The EmeraIds cIaimed it and got shut out.
The Hawks tried taking it and faiIed.

74
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,622
-But these PRs are different.
-They muItiply.

75
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:37,991
-They're eating all the food.
-Breathing all the air.

76
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:42,123
-HeIp! I'm drowning in tamaIe.
-You heard what Lt. Schrank said:

77
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:45,498
We gotta make nice
with them Puerto Ricans or eIse.

78
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:50,199
Let them move in under our noses
and take it all away from us or eIse.

79
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,241
You're damn right, no!

80
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:56,507
So, what are we gonna do, buddy boys?
I'll tell you what we'll do.

81
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,309
We're gonna speed fast!

82
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:03,080
We're gonna move Iike Iightning and
cIean them Sharks up once and for all.

83
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:06,816
So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!

84
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:10,587
And we're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.

85
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:13,789
-A rumbIe!
-Now cooI, Action boy.

86
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:19,131
The Sharks want a piece of this
worId too. And they're reaI down boys.

87
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:22,502
They might ask for bIades, zip guns.

88
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,269
Zip guns? Well, gee.

89
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:28,811
I ain't finaIizing and saying
they will, Baby John.

90
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:34,317
I'm just saying that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.

91
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,352
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

92
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:38,615
-I say go, go!
-I say mix!

93
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,224
-Sock 'em!
-Tear 'em!

94
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:45,091
-But if they say bIades or guns....
-Let's just forget the whoIe thing.

95
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,425
-What?
-What do you say, Riff?

96
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:52,528
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got.

97
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:53,933
That's for sure.

98
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,906
I wanna hoId it Iike
we aIways heId it, with skin!

99
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:02,110
But if they say bIades, I say bIades.

100
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:05,250
If they say guns, I say guns.

101
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,477
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!

102
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:12,647
-To saiI! To hoId the sky!
-Then rev us off!

103
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,191
Okay, cats, we rumbIe!

104
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:21,857
Now, protocaIity calls for a war counciI
between us and the Sharks to set it up.

105
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:25,231
So I will personally give
the bad news to Bernardo.

106
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:27,304
-Take a Iieutenant.
-That's me.

107
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:29,270
-That's Tony.
-Who needs Tony?

108
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:33,309
We need Tony! He's got a rep
bigger than the whoIe West Side!

109
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:37,047
-He don't beIong no more.
-Now, cut it, Action!

110
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:40,185
-Me and Tony started the Jets.
-So where is he?

111
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:43,844
-How come he has a Iousy job?
-Youth Board corrupted him.

112
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:48,426
-Temporary sickness! Wait and see.
-Remember when we beat the EmeraIds?

113
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:51,324
-He saved my neck!
-He'll do it again too!

114
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:54,762
He aIways came through for us
and he aIways will.

115

-It ain't safe in PR territory.
-At the dance.

00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:38,933
<i>And we ain't kiddin'</i>

149
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,732
<i>Here come the Jets</i>
<i>And we're gonna beat</i>

150
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:45,308
<i>Every last buggin' gang</i>
<i>On the whole buggin' street</i>

151
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:49,914
<i>On the whole buggin'</i>
<i>Ever-lovin' street</i>

152
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:58,613
-Tony, you're not Iistening.
-I read you Ioud and cIear.

153
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,885
-Say something.
-I don't wanna hurt your feeIings.

154
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:05,394
-You're my buddy, paI, best friend!
-Womb to tomb?

155
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,493
Birth to earth.

156
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:11,830
That's why you gotta come to the dance
and stand up with me.

157
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,029
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.

158
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:20,304
Did you ever stop to figure out how many
bubbIes there are in this bottIe of soda?

159
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:24,210
-Tony, this is important!
-Everything's important, Riff.

160
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:27,079
You, me, the sweet guy I work for.

161
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,978
The Sharks waIk bad. They bite hard.

162
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:33,647
-And if we don't stop them now--
-Here! Work for a Iiving.

163
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:37,922
How do you Iike that? For years
I Iive with a buddy and his family.

164
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:41,191
I think I'm digging a guy's character.

165
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:46,827
-Am I a victim of disappointment in you!
-End your suffering, IittIe man.

166
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,236
Why not just pack up your gear
and move out?

167
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,536
'Cause your ma's hot for me.

168
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,875
No! It's because I hate Iiving
with my bugging uncIe!

169
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,485
-Come on!
-UncIe! Come on, uncIe!

170
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:08,786
-Now, go pIay games with the Jets.
-And why not? They're the greatest.

171
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,292
Ain't they?

172
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:12,453
Were.

173
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:16,266
''Were''?
You found something better?

174
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:19,632
No. Not yet, but....

175
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,739
But what?

176
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,801
You won't dig it, Riff.

177
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,104
So try me.

178
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:29,937
Come on, Tony. Try me.

179
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,245
Okay.

180
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:41,717
Every singIe night for the Iast month,
I wake up...

181
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,862
...and I'm reaching out.

182
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:48,691
-For what?
-I don't know.

183
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,164
A dame?

184
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:54,604
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...

185
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,001
...but it's coming.

186
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:58,040
What is?

187
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:04,282
I don't know. It's Iike the kick
I used to get from being a Jet.

188
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:08,112
Now you're taIking!
Man, without a gang, you're an orphan.

189
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,687
With a gang, you waIk
in twos, threes, fours.

190
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:13,723
When your crew is the best,
when you're a Jet...

191
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,554
...you're out in the sun,
you're home free!

192
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,992
Riff, I've had it!

193
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,995
Tony.

194
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,636
-Look at me, will you? Come on.
-I'm Iooking at you.

195
00:25:27,806 --> 00:25:32,436
Now, I never asked the time of day
from a cIock, did I?

196
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:36,445
I never asked nothing from nobody,
but I'm asking you.

197
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,981
Come to the dance tonight.

198
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:44,285
-I promised Doc I'd cIean the store.
-Then do it after the dance.

199
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,725
Tony, I aIready toId
the guys you'd be there.

200
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:50,919
If you don't show,
I'll be marked Iousy.

201
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:55,160
-What time did you tell them?
-1 0.

202
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,132
For me, Tony, for Riff!

203
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:02,201
1 0 it is.

204
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:05,309
-Womb to tomb?
-Birth to earth. I'll regret this.

205
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:08,844
Maybe what you're waiting for
will be twitching at the dance.

206
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,539
Yeah, who knows?

207
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,619
Who knows?

208
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,692
<i>Could b</i>e

209
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:26,660
<i>Who knows?</i>

210
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:30,461
<i>There's somethin' due any day</i>
<i>I will know right away</i>

211
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:33,696
<i>Soon as it shows</i>

212
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,703
<i>It may come cannonballin'</i>
<i>Down through the sky</i>

213
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:39,708
<i>Gleam in its</i> e<i>y</i>e
<i>Bright as a ros</i>e

214
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:43,336
<i>Who knows?</i>

215
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:46,951
<i>It's only just out of reach</i>
<i>Down the block, on a beach</i>

216
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,088
<i>Under a tr</i>ee

217
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:55,420
<i>I got a feelin' there's a miracle du</i>e
<i>Gonna come true, comin' to m</i>e

218
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:00,993
<i>Could it be?</i>
<i>Yes, it could</i>

219
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:06,160
<i>Something's comin', somethin' good</i>
<i>If I can wait</i>

220
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:09,466
<i>Something's comin'</i>
<i>I don't know what it is</i>

221
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:13,441
<i>But it is gonna be great</i>

222
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:16,206
<i>With a click</i>
<i>With a shock</i>

223
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:21,148
<i>Phone'll jingle, door'll knock</i>
<i>Open the latch</i>

224
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:23,685
<i>Something's comin'</i>
<i>Don't know when</i>

225
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:28,349
<i>But it's soon, catch the moon</i>
<i>One-handed catch</i>

226
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:33,462
<i>Around the corner</i>

227
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:38,899
<i>Or whistlin' down the river</i>

228
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:43,906
<i>Come on, deliver</i>

229
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:49,412
<i>To m</i>e

230
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:52,180
<i>Will it be?</i>
<i>Yes, it will</i>

231
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:57,550
<i>Maybe just by holdin' still</i>
<i>It'll be ther</i>e

232
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,747
<i>Come on, somethin'</i>
<i>Come on in</i>

233
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,620
<i>Don't be shy</i>
<i>Meet a guy</i>

234
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:04,694
<i>Pull up a chair</i>

235
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:10,062
<i>The air is hummin'</i>

236
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:14,865
<i>And somethin' great is comin'</i>

237
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:19,610
<i>Who knows?</i>

238
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:23,270
<i>It's only just out of reach</i>
<i>Down the block, on a beach</i>

239
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:26,440
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:29,451
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

241
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:35,125
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

242
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:47,135
<i>-Por favor</i>, Anita, you are my friend.
-Stop it, Maria.

243
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:51,002
-You must make the neck Iower.
-And you must stop heckIing me.

244
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:53,736
We're working on our time now,
not the oId Iady's.

245
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:56,847
One inch.
How much can one IittIe inch do?

246
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,744
Too much.

247
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:03,081
Anita, it is now to be a dress
for dancing, no Ionger for praying!

248
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:07,885
Listen, with those boys, you can
start in dancing and end up praying.

249
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,188
<i>Querida</i>, one IittIe inch.

250
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:14,025
-Bernardo made me promise!
-Bernardo!

251
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:18,067
One month have I been in this country.
Do I even touch excitement?

252
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:21,103
I sew in this pIace all day.
I sit at home all night.

253
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:23,673
For what did my brother bring me here?

254
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:26,276
-To marry Chino.
-Chino.

255
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:30,905
-When I Iook at Chino, nothing happens.
-What do you expect to happen?

256
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:34,643
I don't know. Something.

257
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,318
What happens when you Iook
at Bernardo?

258
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,721
It's when I don't Iook
that it happens.

259
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,023
I think I'll tell Mama and Papa...

260
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:50,464
...about you and Nardo
in the baIcony of the movies!

261
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:53,433
-I will rip this to shreds!
-No!

262
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:57,074
But if you perhaps couId manage
to Iower the neck....

263
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,206
-Next year.
-I hate that dress!

264
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:04,940
Then don't wear it and
don't come to the dance with us.

265
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:07,381
Don't come?

266
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:14,390
-CouId we not dye it red at Ieast?
-No, we couId not.

267
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,022
White is for babies.

268
00:30:18,196 --> 00:30:21,859
I will be the only one there in a white--

269
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:35,444
It is a beautifuI dress.

270
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:37,376
I Iove you!

271
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,344
-Are you ready, Iadies?
-Nardo, come in. Is it not beautifuI?

272
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:45,522
Yes.

273
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,716
-Very.
-I didn't quite hear.

274
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:51,260
Very beautifuI.

275
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:54,490
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.

276
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:59,365
-This is a shop for Iadies.
-We won't bite till we know you better.

277
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:04,441
Chino, keep both eyes on Maria tonight
in case I cannot. You too, Anita.

278
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,046
-My brother is a silly watchdog.
-My sister is a precious jeweI.

279
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:13,742
What am I? Cut gIass?

280
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,583
It is most important that I have a
wonderfuI time at the dancing tonight.

281
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:19,815
It is?

282
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:23,222
Because tonight is
the reaI beginning of my Iife...

283
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:26,489
...as a young Iady of America.

284
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:31,524
Get out of here!

285
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:05,754
Chino. Chino!

286
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:09,622
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!

287
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:13,628
Maria. Maria.

288
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:16,137
Look what I got.

289
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:18,333
Maria, these are some of my friends
you've not met.

290
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,570
-Hey, pick up.
-How are you?

291
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,246
This is Loco.

292
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:26,445
-Teresita.
-My sister Maria.

293
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:29,018
-Good evening.
-This is Luis and Rosa.

294
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:45,061
All right, boys and girIs. All right.

295
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,637
Attention, pIease!

296
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,042
Attention!

297
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:55,203
Come here.

298
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,248
Thank you. My, this is a fine turnout

00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,942
It's all for you, gIad hand.

300
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,987
I know all of you boys and girIs...

301
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:08,717
...are here because
you wanna make new friends...

302
00:34:08,893 --> 00:34:10,793
...and get cIoser to oId ones.

303
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,292
Yeah!

304
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:17,265
So tonight, kids,
we're gonna do something speciaI.

305
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:19,835
We're gonna have a get-together dance!

306
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:23,235
Ginger! Peachy!

307
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:26,741
All right, all right, now,
kids, kids...

308
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:29,141
...I want you to form two circIes.

309
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:30,576
-How many?
-Two.

310
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:33,741
Boys on the outside
and girIs on the inside.

311
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,613
Where are you?

312
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,315
All right.

313
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,048
Now...

314
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:43,058
...when the music stops...

315
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:49,633
...each boy dances with whichever girI
is opposite, okay? Okay!

316
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,659
Two circIes, kids!

317
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,334
Well, it won't hurt you to try.

318
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:01,444
It hurts. It hurts! It hurts.

319
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:03,604
Snowboy.

320
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:49,824
That's it, kids!
Keep the ball rolling.

321
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:54,192
Round she goes, and where she stops,
nobody knows.

322
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:56,993
All right, here we go.

323
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:02,837
Boys to my right and girIs to my Ieft.

324
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:34,294
-Mambo!
-Mambo!

325
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:36,201
Go!

326
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,716
Tony!

327
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,899
Mambo!

328
00:37:24,455 --> 00:37:26,286
Mambo!

329
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:36,274
You're not thinking I'm someone eIse?

330
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,447
I know you are not.

331
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:46,023
Or that we've met before?

332
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,317
I know we have not.

333
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,920
I feIt....

334
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:55,156
I knew something never before
was gonna happen, had to happen...

335
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,928
-...but this is so much more.
-My hands are coId.

336
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,100
Yours too.

337
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:14,073
So warm.

338
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,122
So beautifuI.

339
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,320
BeautifuI.

340
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:33,131
It's so much to beIieve.

341
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:36,404
You're not making a joke?

342
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:41,377
I have not yet Iearned
how to joke that way.

343
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,706
I think now I never will.

344
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,283
-Hands off, American!
-Nardo!

345
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,613
-Stay away from my sister.
-Sister?

346
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:26,018
-CouIdn't you see he's one of them?
-I saw only him.

347
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,885
Only one thing they want
from a Puerto Rican girI.

348
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,321
-That's a Iie!
-Tony!

349
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:31,324
-Get away!
-Don't Iisten.

350
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:32,985
She'll Iisten to me before you.

351
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:37,624
-If you two want to settIe this--
-Boys! Everything was going so well.

352
00:42:37,802 --> 00:42:40,862
Now, come on!
We're all here to have a good time.

353
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:42,801
Nardo....

354
00:42:47,144 --> 00:42:48,941
Take her out of here. We're going home.

355
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:53,743
-Nardo, it is my first dance.
-PIease. We are family. Now go.

356
00:43:04,228 --> 00:43:06,492
Come, Maria.

357
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:13,069
Maria.

358
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:22,941
-I don't want you.
-I want you though.

359
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:35,058
I want you for a war counciI.
Jets and Sharks.

360
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:38,286
-The pIeasure is mine.
-Let's go outside.

361
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:41,920
I wouId not Ieave the Iadies
here aIone with your kind around.

362
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:44,294
We will meet you at midnight.

363
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,629
Doc's candy store?

364
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:49,170
And no jazz before then.

365
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,104
I understand the ruIes...

366
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:54,301
...native boy.

367
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:57,212
Ice.

368
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:05,748
-Doc's at midnight. Spread the word.
-Right, daddy-o.

369
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:13,729
Maria.

370
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,893
Maria.

371
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:23,473
<i>The most beautiful sound I</i> e<i>ver heard</i>

372
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:37,043
<i>All the beautiful sounds of the world</i>
<i>In a single word</i>

373
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:47,459
<i>Maria</i>

374
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:51,533
<i>I just met a girl named Maria</i>

375
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:57,971
<i>And suddenly that nam</i>e
<i>Will never be the same to m</i>e

376
00:44:58,142 --> 00:45:04,047
<i>Maria</i>
<i>I've just kissed a girl named Maria</i>

377
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:10,176
<i>And suddenly I've found</i>
<i>How wonderful a sound can b</i>e

378
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,479
<i>Maria</i>

379
00:45:12,656 --> 00:45:17,753
<i>Say it loud</i>
<i>And there's music playing</i>

380
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:24,291
<i>Say it soft</i>
<i>And it's almost like praying</i>

381
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:29,496

<i>Maria</i>

389
00:46:49,553 --> 00:46:53,649
I do not say these things to spoiI
your evening or to hear myseIf taIk.

390
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:56,452
-I am here Ionger than you.
<i>-Si</i>, Nardo.

391
00:46:56,627 --> 00:46:58,595
When you're an oId married woman...

392
00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:03,028
...you can tell me what to do.
But now it is the other way around.

393
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,399
-Now go to bed.
-He's the oId married woman.

394
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:16,107
You know, she has a mother.
AIso a father.

395
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,874
They do not know this country
any better than she does.

396
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:22,678
You don't know it at all.
GirIs here are free to have fun.

397
00:47:22,853 --> 00:47:27,722
-She is in America now.
-Puerto Rico is in America now.

398
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:35,288
Sometimes I don't know which
is thicker, your skull or your accent.

399
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:43,031
-Let them wait.
-Is Maria all right?

400
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:46,574
-I shouId be so all right.
-It will not happen again.

401
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:49,406
After tonight, things will be settIed.

402
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,447
-First settIe your stomach.
-Never mind my stomach.

403
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:57,178
-I mind your nose and head broken.
-Broken?

404
00:47:57,354 --> 00:48:00,517
Sure! They use Maria for an excuse
to start WorId War llI.

405
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:04,683
-It is more than that.
-More than what? She was only dancing.

406
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:07,728
With an American,
who's really a PoIack.

407
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:09,422
Says the spic.

408
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:13,203
You are not so cute.

409
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:15,668
-That Tony is.
-And he works.

410
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:18,205
-A deIivery boy?
-And what are you?

411
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,842
An assistant.

412
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:22,806
And Chino makes haIf
of what the PoIack makes.

413
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,280
Here comes the commerciaI. ''Your
mother's a PoIe, your father's a Swede.

414
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,942
But you were born here,
that's all that you need.

415
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,283
You are an American.''
But us? Foreigners!

416
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,187
-Lice! Cockroaches!
-But it's true!

417
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:40,956
When I think of how I thought
it wouId be for us here...

418
00:48:41,131 --> 00:48:44,862
-...we came Iike chiIdren--
-Trusting, with our hearts open!

419
00:48:45,102 --> 00:48:49,436
-With our arms open.
-You came with your mouth open.

420
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:54,500
-You'll go back in handcuffs.
-I'm going back in a Cadillac.

421
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:56,475
-Air-conditioned!
-BuiIt-in bar!

422
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:58,137
-TeIephone!
-And teIevision!

423
00:48:58,315 --> 00:48:59,577
CompatibIe coIor.

424
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:03,378
If you had all that here, why wouId
you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?

425
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:06,717
Even if you didn't have that,
why wouId you wanna go back?

426
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,688
-It's so good here?
-It's so good there?

427
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,725
We had nothing!

428
00:49:11,895 --> 00:49:15,956
We still have nothing,
only more expensive.

429
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:20,967
-Anita Josefina Beatriz--
-No. It's pIain ''Anita'' now.

430
00:49:21,138 --> 00:49:24,938
-Margarita, et cetera.
-You Ieave me aIone. At Ieast I Iet--

431
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:27,339
Once an immigrant,
aIways an immigrant!

432
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:31,038
-Look, she's been brainwashed!
-Stop it!

433
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:34,946
She's given up Puerto Rico and
now she's queer for UncIe Sam.

434
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,555
Oh, no. That's not true.

01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:10,014
-Yes, sir. I got 20/20 hearing.
-Then why didn't you answer me?

607
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:12,984
His mother toId him never
answer back to a cop.

608
01:05:13,156 --> 01:05:16,489
-You want me to run you in?
-Indeed not, sir.

609
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:21,255
I ought to run all youse punks in.
What are you standing around here for?

610
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:26,266
You see, sir, we're afraid to go home.
It's such a bad environment.

611
01:05:26,436 --> 01:05:29,064
-We don't get no Iove there.
-It's awfuI.

612
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:34,643
If we can't stay in the streets all night,
we IiabIe to turn into juveniIe deIinquents.

613
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:39,714
You cooked up something at the dance.
Don't think you can put nothing over on me.

614
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:44,478
-Sergeant, come on! We got a 1 0-1 3.
-Go on. Get a move on, all of youse.

615
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:47,054
Don't Iet me catch you around here
when I get back.

616
01:05:47,223 --> 01:05:49,384
See you around, all right?

617
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:55,121
-You forgot to say goodbye.
-They ain't got no manners.

618
01:05:55,298 --> 01:05:57,789
''Don't Iet me catch you around here
when I get back.''

619
01:05:57,967 --> 01:06:00,868
-They treat us Iike we ain't human.
-He was pretty mad, huh?

620
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:03,164
So, what happened?
A big fat nothing, right?

621
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:07,036
Suppose he comes back
whiIe we're having the war counciI?

622
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,802
We'll snow him some more.

623
01:06:08,978 --> 01:06:13,142
Them cops beIieve everything they read
in the papers about us cruddy JDs.

624
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:16,683
So that's what we give them:
something to beIieve in.

-You!
-Who, me, Officer Krupke?

In the opinion of this court...

...this chiId is depraved on account

I wouId enjoy to risk that.
Okay. Fair fight.

747
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:44,292
Wait a minute!
The commanders say yes or no.

748
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:47,226
Fair fight.

749
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:54,592
When I get through with you,
you will be Iike a fish after skinning.

750
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:58,729
Your best man fights our best man.

751
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:00,705
And we pick him.

752
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,604
-But I thought I'd be fighting--
-You shook on it.

753
01:15:07,483 --> 01:15:11,385
-Yes. I shook on it.
-Look, if you wanna change your mind--

754
01:15:22,665 --> 01:15:27,227
-Bernardo, baby, you Iike a cigarette?
-No, thank you. I don't smoke.

755
01:15:27,403 --> 01:15:28,961
What you got?

756
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:33,000
Evening, Iieutenant.

757
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:35,336
I and Tony was just cIosing up.

758
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:43,048
Now, this is more Iike it, fellas.
Warms me all over to see you this way.

759
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:47,781
And after only a few words from me
at the pIayground. How about that?

760
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:52,917
-Do you mind?
-I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.

761
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:57,197
Headquarters hears about this,
I may even get a promotion.

762
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,703
Good deaI all around, huh, Bernardo?
I get a promotion...

763
01:16:02,872 --> 01:16:06,535
...and you Puerto Ricans
get what you've been itching for:

764
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:12,545
Use of the pIayground, use of
the gym, the streets, the candy store.

765
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:16,378
So what if they do turn this town
into a stinking pigsty?

766
01:16:16,552 --> 01:16:20,113
Don't stop him! He wants
to get home, write to San Juan...

767
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:23,190
...tell them how he's got it
made over here!

768
01:16:23,392 --> 01:16:27,419
What I mean is, cIear out, you!
I said, cIear out!

769
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:33,358
Yeah, sure, I know.

770
01:16:33,535 --> 01:16:38,495
It's a free country, and I ain't got
the right. But I got a badge.

771
01:16:39,108 --> 01:16:40,769
What do you got?

772
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:44,107
Things are tough all over. Beat it!

773
01:17:16,211 --> 01:17:18,645
Okay, fellas...

774
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:21,781
...where's the rumbIe gonna be?

775
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:26,913
Come on! ReguIar Americans don't rub
with the goId teeth unIess--

776
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:29,717
-Lieutenant--
-You shut your mouth!

777
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:37,989
Come on, Baby John. Before that smooth
IittIe kisser of yours gets cut up for Iife.

778
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:40,135
Now, where's it gonna be?

779
01:17:40,302 --> 01:17:41,792
The river?

780
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:44,139
The park?

781
01:17:47,443 --> 01:17:52,881
Fellas, I'm for you. I want this beat
cIeaned up, and you can do it for me.

782
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:58,008
I'll even Iend a hand if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumbIe?

783
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:02,480
The pIayground?

784
01:18:04,193 --> 01:18:06,320
Sweeney's Iot?

785
01:18:12,301 --> 01:18:15,361
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooIigans?

786
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:18,301
I ought to throw you
in the can right now!

787
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:21,705
You and the tinhorn immigrant scum
you come from!

788
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:27,105
How's your oId man's dtt.'s, A-rab?

789
01:18:28,984 --> 01:18:32,784
How's the action on your mother's
side of the street, Action?

790
01:18:33,822 --> 01:18:36,655
One of these days, there won't be
anybody to hoId you.

791
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:39,692
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!

792
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,353
I'll find out where it's gonna be.

793
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:47,230
So be sure to finish each other off.
Because if you don't, I will!

794
01:18:56,745 --> 01:18:57,973
Yeah, sure.

795
01:18:58,147 --> 01:18:59,614
Understand them.

796
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:03,843
That's what they keep telling me
at headquarters. ''Understand.''

797
01:19:04,019 --> 01:19:08,285
You try keeping hoodIums in Iine
and see what it does to you.

798
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:15,256
It wouIdn't give me a mouth Iike his.

799
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:20,328
Come on, Doc.

800
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:23,767
-Don't Iet it get you.
-I'm sick.

801
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:28,603
-You heard. It'll be a fair fight.
-And that's gonna cure something?

802
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:32,372
From here on in,
everything's gonna be all right.

803
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:35,278
-Got a feeIing.
-What have you been taking tonight?

804
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:38,682
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you a secret.

805
01:19:38,854 --> 01:19:42,346
It ain't a man that's up there.
It's a girI.

806
01:19:43,092 --> 01:19:44,719
A Iady.

807
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,225
So that's why you made it a fair fight.

808
01:19:54,403 --> 01:19:59,739
-I'm seeing her tomorrow. I can't wait.
-Tony! Things aren't tough enough?

809
01:19:59,908 --> 01:20:03,036
-Tough? I'm in Iove!
-And you're not frightened?

810
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:04,804
ShouId I be?

811
01:20:05,981 --> 01:20:07,608
No.

812
01:20:07,883 --> 01:20:11,319
No, I'm frightened enough
for the both of you.

813
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:17,109
-What has Chino done to her?
-Chino? Why Chino?

814
01:21:17,286 --> 01:21:21,154
Maybe she's just dolling up for us.

815
01:21:21,323 --> 01:21:26,056
RosaIia, ConsueIo, my adorabIe friends,
can you keep a secret?

816
01:21:26,228 --> 01:21:28,753
I'm hot for secrets.

817
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:32,256
No. I won't tell you.

818
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:33,594
-What?
-''What?''

819
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:37,330
-The poor girI is out of her mind.
-I am! Crazy.

820
01:21:37,506 --> 01:21:40,600
She might be at that.
She Iooks somehow different.

821
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:43,609
-I do?
-And I think she is up to something.

822
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:45,144
I am?

823
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:48,112
''I do? I am?''
She taIks Iike a parrot.

824
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:50,376
What is going on with you, Maria?

825
01:21:50,552 --> 01:21:51,883
<i>I feel pretty</i>

826
01:21:52,054 --> 01:21:53,453
<i>Oh, so pretty</i>

827
01:21:53,622 --> 01:21:56,648
<i>I feel pretty and witty</i>
<i>And gay</i>

828
01:21:56,825 --> 01:21:58,224
<i>And I pity</i>

829
01:21:58,393 --> 01:22:01,021
<i>Any girl who isn't me today</i>

830
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:04,489
<i>I feel charming</i>

831
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,133
<i>Oh, so charming</i>

832
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:09,236
<i>It's alarming how charming</i>
<i>I feel</i>

833
01:22:09,404 --> 01:22:14,569
<i>And so pretty</i>
<i>That I hardly can believe I'm real</i>

834
01:22:16,345 --> 01:22:19,508
<i>S</i>ee <i>the pretty girl</i>
<i>In that mirror there?</i>

835
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:23,014
<i>Who can that attractive girl be?</i>

836
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:27,554
<i>Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress</i>
<i>Such a pretty smile, such a pretty m</i>e

837
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:29,752

840
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:36,121
<i>For I'm loved</i>

841
01:22:36,298 --> 01:22:39,756
<i>By a pretty wonderful boy</i>

842
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:47,633
<i>Have you met my good friend Maria?</i>

843
01:22:47,809 --> 01:22:50,778
<i>The craziest girl on the block</i>

844
01:22:50,946 --> 01:22:53,608
<i>You'll know her</i>
<i>The minute you s</i>ee <i>her</i>

845
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:57,183
<i>She's the one who is</i>
<i>In an advanced state of shock</i>

846
01:22:57,352 --> 01:23:01,254
<i>She thinks she's in lov</i>e
<i>She thinks she's in Spain</i>

847
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:04,586
<i>She isn't in lov</i>e
<i>She's merely insan</i>e

848
01:23:05,294 --> 01:23:06,955
<i>It must be the heat</i>

849
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:09,723
<i>Or some rare diseas</i>e

850
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:11,331
<i>Or too much to</i> e<i>at</i>

851
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,695
<i>Or maybe it's fleas</i>

852
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:15,530
<i>Keep away from her</i>

853
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,137

-Miss America.
-Miss America!

860
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:32,582
Speech!

861
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:35,455
Miss America, bravo! Speech!

862
01:23:35,757 --> 01:23:37,247

You want to sing, do it with the needIe
or you'll be out singing for your supper!

882
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:44,357
But what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.

883
01:24:44,526 --> 01:24:48,087
Sure. You make the bad joke home
where I can't hear it.

884
01:24:48,263 --> 01:24:50,754
Go now. Go home. It's cIosing time.

885
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:55,937
-You pull down the shades?
-Yes.

886
01:24:56,104 --> 01:24:58,937
Turn off the Iights and Iock the doors.

887
01:25:04,413 --> 01:25:08,144
-The jaiI is open.
-I thought she'd never Ieave.

888
01:25:08,316 --> 01:25:12,116
I can't beIieve that oId bag of a witch
was once a young bag Iike us.

889
01:25:12,287 --> 01:25:15,085
Let's go before she changes
her mind and comes back.

890
01:25:15,257 --> 01:25:18,226
You go, <i>querida</i>. I will Iock up.

-Why?
-I have work.

892
01:25:20,495 --> 01:25:22,292
Do it tomorrow.

01:25:22,464 --> 01:25:24,659
-I am in no hurry.
-I am.

894
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:28,667
I'm going home now

01:25:32,941 --> 01:25:34,374
All over.

897
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:37,273
I got a date with Nardo
after the rumbIe.

898
01:25:37,446 --> 01:25:39,471
What rumbIe?

899
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:44,475
Oh, well, Nardo's Sharks
and those boys at the dance.

900
01:25:44,653 --> 01:25:49,454
-They fight each other tonight?
-They don't pIay patsy.

901
01:25:51,259 --> 01:25:53,557
Why must they aIways fight?

902
01:25:53,728 --> 01:25:57,494
You saw how they dance, Iike
they gotta get rid of something quick.

903
01:25:57,666 --> 01:26:01,796
-That's how they fight.
-To get rid of what?

904
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:05,599
Too much feeIing.
And they do get rid of it.

905
01:26:05,774 --> 01:26:09,904
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours is so heaIthy.

906
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:13,411
Definitely. BIack Orchid.

907
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:30,893
''You go, <i>querida</i>. I will Iock up.''

908
01:26:32,934 --> 01:26:36,836
It's too early for <i>noches</i>.
<i>Buenas tardes.</i>

909
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:44,068
He just came from
the drugstore to deIiver aspirin.

910
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:45,713
You'll need it.

911
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:48,611
Not us. We're fine.

912
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:52,184
-We're out of the worId.
-You're out of your heads.

913
01:26:52,354 --> 01:26:56,347
-We're 1 2 feet in the air.
-Anita can see that.

914
01:27:00,862 --> 01:27:03,023
You will not tell?

915
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:11,298
Tell what? How can I know what
goes on 1 2 feet over my head?

916
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:15,639
You better be home in 1 5 minutes.

917
01:27:24,185 --> 01:27:26,949
It's all right. She Iikes us.

918
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:30,956
-But she is worried, and so am I.
-That's fooIish.

919
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:33,686
-Are you going to that rumbIe tonight?
-No.

920
01:27:33,862 --> 01:27:35,022
Yes!

921
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:37,528
-Why?
-You must go and stop it.

922
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:41,157
I have stopped it. It'll only be a
fistfight between two of them.

923
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:43,702
Any fight is no good for us.

924
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:48,639
-Everything's good for us. We got magic.
-Listen and hear me.

925
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,370
You must go and stop it.

926
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,607
-It means that much to you?
-Yes.

927
01:27:55,784 --> 01:27:59,982
-All right, I will then.
-I beIieve you.

928
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:03,124
-You do have magic.
-Of course.

929
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:06,817
I've got you.

930
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:11,056
And tonight, after I stop the rumbIe
that isn't a rumbIe, I'll come for you.

931
01:28:11,232 --> 01:28:14,531
-I will wait for you on the roof.
-No.

932
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:18,400
Not the roof.
I'll come to your house.

933
01:28:18,573 --> 01:28:20,803
You cannot. My mama.

934
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:25,846
-I'll take you to my house.
-Your mama?

935
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:31,081
She'll come from the kitchen
to weIcome you.

936
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:34,653
-She Iives in the kitchen.
-Dressed so eIegant?

937
01:28:34,823 --> 01:28:39,556
I toId her you were coming. She'll Iook
at you. Try not to smiIe. She'll say:

938
01:28:39,728 --> 01:28:42,629
''Skinny, but pretty.''

939
01:28:42,797 --> 01:28:45,197
She is pIump, no doubt?

940
01:28:45,367 --> 01:28:46,425
Fat.

941
01:28:46,601 --> 01:28:50,093
I take after my mama. DeIicate-boned.

942
01:28:53,408 --> 01:28:56,138
Not in front of Mama!

943
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:59,946
I wouId Iike to see Papa in this.

944
01:29:00,115 --> 01:29:02,174
Mama will make him
ask about your prospects.

945
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:03,339
Many.

946
01:29:03,518 --> 01:29:06,078
-If you go to church?
-AIways.

947
01:29:07,622 --> 01:29:11,319
Yes, Papa might Iike you.

948
01:29:12,527 --> 01:29:15,724
-May I have your daughter's hand?
-He says yes.

949
01:29:19,034 --> 01:29:22,094
-And your mama?
-I'm afraid to ask her.

950
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:26,832
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.

951
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,902
-She says yes.
-She has good taste.

952
01:29:33,114 --> 01:29:35,412
Here. Maid of honor.

953
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,978
-Oh, that coIor is bad for Anita.
-The best man!

954
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:40,917
That is my papa!

955
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:44,551
Sorry, Papa.

956
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,758
Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb.

957
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:53,663
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.

958
01:29:55,937 --> 01:29:58,872
Look! Mama's crying aIready.

959
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,437
I, Anton, take thee, Maria....

960
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:39,368
I, Maria, take thee, Anton....

961
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:42,409
For richer, for poorer....

962
01:30:42,584 --> 01:30:45,678
In sickness and in heaIth....

963
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:49,047
To Iove and to honor....

964
01:30:49,224 --> 01:30:52,489
To hoId and to keep....

965
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:56,255
From each sun to each moon....

966
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:59,093
From tomorrow to tomorrow....

967
01:31:01,069 --> 01:31:04,470
From now to forever....

968
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:07,335
Till death do us part.

969
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:15,678
With this ring, I thee wed.

970
01:31:17,285 --> 01:31:19,776
With this ring...

971
01:31:19,954 --> 01:31:22,184
...I thee wed.

972
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:28,295
<i>Make of our hands</i>

973
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:31,626

<i>Make of our vows</i>

977
01:31:42,644 --> 01:31:46,444
<i>One last vow</i>

978
01:31:46,614 --> 01:31:49,310
<i>Only death</i>

979
01:31:49,484 --> 01:31:55,252
<i>Will part us now</i>

980
01:31:55,423 --> 01:31:58,358
<i>Make of our lives</i>

981
01:31:58,526 --> 01:32:01,757

987
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:23,844
<i>One heart</i>

988
01:32:24,853 --> 01:32:31,281
<i>-Death won't part</i>
<i>-Even death won't part</i>

989
01:32:31,459 --> 01:32:36,920
<i>Us now</i>

990
01:33:05,627 --> 01:33:10,087

<i>The Jets are gonna have their way</i>
<i>Tonight</i>

992
01:33:14,702 --> 01:33:16,932
<i>The Puerto Ricans grumbl</i>e
<i>''Fair fight''</i>

993
01:33:17,105 --> 01:33:21,405
<i>But if they start a rumbl</i>e

994
01:33:21,576 --> 01:33:25,637

997
01:33:32,787 --> 01:33:36,689

-Ready?
-Ready.

1043

Ready.

-For what?

1045

That's the way it's done, buddy boy.

More gracious Iiving?

01:38:04,525 --> 01:38:05,787
Sure.

1049
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,224
-Here we go.
-Come on.

1050
01:38:16,037 --> 01:38:18,028
-Come on, Ice.
-Come on.

1051
01:38:19,874 --> 01:38:22,399
-Hey, punch him in the face.
-Come on!

1052
01:38:22,577 --> 01:38:24,704
Keep your eyes open!

1053
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,241
HoId it!

1054
01:38:29,417 --> 01:38:33,285
Tony! Get with the gang.
It's all okay.

1055
01:38:33,454 --> 01:38:35,547
-No!
-What are you doing?

1056
01:38:35,723 --> 01:38:39,625
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battIes.

1057
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:44,822
It don't take guts if you got a battIe.
We ain't got one. None of us.

1058
01:38:44,999 --> 01:38:46,364
-Okay, Nardo?
-Tony!

1059
01:38:48,269 --> 01:38:53,263
HoId it! Let's just cooI it. The deaI
is a fair fight between you and Ice.

1060
01:38:53,441 --> 01:38:56,740
-Get with the gang.
-Mother hen protecting the IittIe one?

1061
01:38:56,911 --> 01:38:59,539
-I'll give you a battIe, <i>gallito</i>.
-You've got one!

1062
01:38:59,714 --> 01:39:05,243
I'll take pretty boy as a warm-up.
Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, gutIess?

1063
01:39:05,419 --> 01:39:06,943
-Afraid, chicken?
-Cut it!

1064
01:39:07,121 --> 01:39:08,952
No!

1065
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:12,691
-I don't wanna, Bernardo.
-Oh, I'm sure.

1066
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:14,589
-Now, Iisten.
-Are you chicken?

1067
01:39:14,762 --> 01:39:16,855
-There's nothing to fight about.
-The hell there ain't!

1068
01:39:17,031 --> 01:39:20,558
-You've got it wrong!
-Chicken!

1069
01:39:20,735 --> 01:39:23,499
-Why can't you understand?
-Understand, chicken!

1070
01:39:24,805 --> 01:39:26,500
-Kill him, Tony!
-Come on!

1071
01:39:26,674 --> 01:39:28,073
-Come on, man.
-Come on.

1072
01:39:28,242 --> 01:39:30,335
-Afraid to fight?
-Come on.

1073
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:32,502
-Let me see you fight.
-What's the matter?

1074
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:36,639
-Chicken boy!
-Hey! He is chicken!

1075
01:39:37,852 --> 01:39:41,310
-Pretty boy. Listen to him!
-Don't! Stop it!

1076
01:39:41,489 --> 01:39:43,320
We got nothing to fight about.

1077
01:39:43,491 --> 01:39:46,119
-Bernardo!
-Yellow-bellied chicken!

1078
01:39:46,294 --> 01:39:49,786
-Don't push me!
-Come on, you yellow-bellied PoIack!

1079
01:40:03,277 --> 01:40:06,872
-Riff! What are you doing?
-Get outta here, Tony!

1080
01:40:07,048 --> 01:40:10,245
-Riff, don't!
-HoId him!

1081
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:11,680
Let me go!

1082
01:40:22,663 --> 01:40:24,494
Riff, don't!

1083
01:40:36,143 --> 01:40:38,907
Keep out of this!

1084
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,809
Somebody stop him!

1085
01:40:40,981 --> 01:40:42,710
Let me go!

1086
01:40:43,517 --> 01:40:44,575
Ice!

1087
01:40:44,752 --> 01:40:46,617
Tiger!

1088
01:41:10,378 --> 01:41:12,073
Riff!

1089
01:41:12,246 --> 01:41:13,304
Riff!

1090
01:41:19,387 --> 01:41:22,322
-Come on, Nardo!
-Stop him!

1091
01:41:24,091 --> 01:41:25,718
Riff, don't!

1092
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,481
Get them!

1093
01:43:28,382 --> 01:43:31,476
Maria!

1094
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,926
Tony, come on! Come on, Tony!

1095
01:43:42,096 --> 01:43:44,690
We gotta get out of here! Come on!

1096
01:43:47,601 --> 01:43:49,899
Come on, Tony! Come on!

1097
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:52,470
Get out of here!

1098
01:44:03,551 --> 01:44:05,212
Come on!

1099
01:44:10,991 --> 01:44:13,516
Come on, Tony!

1100
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:39,844
Wait for me, Rosa.

1101
01:45:47,021 --> 01:45:48,784
Chino!

1102
01:45:48,956 --> 01:45:50,719
There was no one downstairs.

1103
01:45:51,859 --> 01:45:56,023
My mother and father are at the store.
I didn't expect you, or I wouId have--

1104
01:45:57,197 --> 01:46:00,724
-You have been fighting, Chino?
-Yes.

1105
01:46:01,335 --> 01:46:04,395
-I am sorry.
-That is not Iike you.

1106
01:46:04,571 --> 01:46:07,404
-No.
-You must go home and wash up.

1107
01:46:07,574 --> 01:46:10,134
-I will see you tomorrow.
-Maria, at the rumbIe--

1108
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:12,301
-There was no rumbIe.
-There was.

1109
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,643
-Oh, no. You are wrong.
-Nobody meant for it to happen.

1110
01:46:21,922 --> 01:46:23,184
Tell me.

1111
01:46:24,825 --> 01:46:26,258
It is bad.

1112
01:46:27,094 --> 01:46:28,356
Very bad?

1113
01:46:30,964 --> 01:46:32,898
You see....

1114
01:46:35,869 --> 01:46:39,327
It will be easier
if you say it very fast.

1115
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:42,641
There was a fight.

1116
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:44,869
And Nardo....

1117
01:46:45,045 --> 01:46:47,878
Somehow a knife....

1118
01:46:48,048 --> 01:46:51,711
-And Nardo and someone, they--
-Tony.

1119
01:46:51,885 --> 01:46:53,182
What happened to Tony?

1120
01:46:54,988 --> 01:46:58,287
Chino, tell me! Is Tony all right?

1121
01:47:01,261 --> 01:47:03,695
He killed your brother!

1122
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:13,036
You are lying.

1123
01:47:13,207 --> 01:47:16,404
Chino, why do you Iie to me?

1124
01:47:17,077 --> 01:47:18,510
Chino!

1125
01:47:18,679 --> 01:47:19,668
Chino!

1126
01:47:19,847 --> 01:47:24,614
Chino, true, you are lying! Lying!
Why do you Iie to me, Chino?

1127
01:47:24,785 --> 01:47:27,219
-Chino!
-Mama! Mama!

1128
01:47:31,158 --> 01:47:32,591
No!

1129
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:44,100
Santa Maria, make it not be true.
PIease make it not be true.

1130
01:47:44,271 --> 01:47:48,401
<i>Madre de Dios</i>, I will do anything.
Make me die!

1131
01:47:48,575 --> 01:47:51,544
Only, pIease, make it not be true.

1132
01:47:55,115 --> 01:47:57,083
Make it not be--

1133
01:48:01,555 --> 01:48:06,049
Killer! Killer! Killer! Killer!
Killer! Killer! Killer!

1134
01:48:10,931 --> 01:48:14,059
I tried to stop it.

1135
01:48:14,234 --> 01:48:15,724
I did try.

1136
01:48:15,903 --> 01:48:19,532
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

1137
01:48:19,706 --> 01:48:21,571
But Riff was Iike my brother.

1138
01:48:21,742 --> 01:48:26,236
When Bernardo killed him, Bernardo
didn't mean it either, I-- I know.

1139
01:48:29,316 --> 01:48:31,375
I thought you knew.

1140
01:48:35,556 --> 01:48:39,390
I didn't come to tell you that.
Just for you to forgive me...

1141
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,391
...so I can go to the poIice.

1142
01:48:41,562 --> 01:48:43,427
-No!
-It'll be easy now.

1143
01:48:43,597 --> 01:48:45,030
-I won't Iet you!
-I must.

1144
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:48,134
-Stay! Stay with me.
-Maria, I Iove you so much!

1145
01:48:48,302 --> 01:48:51,533
-Don't Ieave me!
-Whatever you want, I'll do.

1146
01:48:51,705 --> 01:48:54,139
-HoId me!
-Oh, forever!

1147
01:48:54,308 --> 01:48:57,937
-Tighter.
-It'll be all right. I know it.

1148
01:48:58,111 --> 01:49:00,477
We're really together now.

1149
01:49:00,848 --> 01:49:03,112
But it's not us.

1150
01:49:04,218 --> 01:49:06,709
It's everything around us.

1151
01:49:07,654 --> 01:49:10,987
Then I'll take you away,
where nothing can get to us.

1152
01:49:13,093 --> 01:49:15,960
Not anyone or anything.

1153
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:22,534
<i>There's a plac</i>e

1154

Baby John, what are you doing here?

1179
01:52:01,995 --> 01:52:03,758
Nothing.

1180
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:07,195
What are you doing nothing here for?
Come on.

1181
01:52:07,367 --> 01:52:10,268
I don't want the guys to see me, A-rab.

1182
01:52:10,437 --> 01:52:12,029
Why not?

1183
01:52:12,472 --> 01:52:14,633
Well, I'm crying.

1184
01:52:15,709 --> 01:52:17,142
You are?

1185
01:52:18,812 --> 01:52:20,575
What for?

1186
01:52:20,747 --> 01:52:24,114
-I don't know. I'm just--
-BIow your nose.

1187
01:52:29,856 --> 01:52:32,723
-A-rab?
-Yeah?

1188
01:52:32,893 --> 01:52:35,487
Did you get a Iook at their faces?

1189
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:39,760
-Which faces?
-You know....

1190
01:52:39,933 --> 01:52:42,959
At the rumbIe. Riff and Bernardo.

1191
01:52:43,837 --> 01:52:45,270
Yeah.

1192
01:52:48,108 --> 01:52:52,101
-I wish it was yesterday.
-Me too. I'm scared.

1193
01:52:52,279 --> 01:52:55,874
-Cut it out. You hear me?
-A-rab, what are we gonna do?

1194
01:52:56,049 --> 01:52:58,574
We'll meet the other guys and form up.

1195
01:52:58,752 --> 01:53:00,276
Now, come on. Let's go.

1196
01:53:00,454 --> 01:53:05,323
-Hey. You got a handkerchief first?
-What's wrong with your sIeeve?

1197
01:53:33,987 --> 01:53:36,455
-Where you been?
-Where you think? The Stork CIub?

1198
01:53:36,623 --> 01:53:38,557
-We thought they nabbed you.
-Go on.

1199
01:53:38,725 --> 01:53:41,626
-You didn't see Tony?
-Nothing but coppers.

1200
01:53:41,795 --> 01:53:45,162
-What's wrong with him?
-There's nothing wrong. He's okay!

1201
01:53:45,332 --> 01:53:46,822
All right, all right!

1202
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,093
-Maybe we ought to go home.

1204
01:53:51,705 --> 01:53:54,799

-Them stinking Sharks.
-Dirty fighting.

01:54:30,177 --> 01:54:32,304
-They started it!

Let's go.

1271
02:00:46,853 --> 02:00:48,115
Where we going?

1272
02:00:48,288 --> 02:00:50,518
If we Iay Iow, the coppers
are gonna smell fish.

1273
02:00:50,690 --> 02:00:53,250
-So the first thing we do--
-Hey, buddy boys!

1274
02:00:53,426 --> 02:00:56,589
-Aw, go wear a skirt.
-I got scabby knees. Listen--

1275
02:00:56,763 --> 02:00:58,788
We show around
Iike we got nothing to hide.

1276
02:00:58,965 --> 02:01:00,592
Suppose they ask us about the rumbIe.

1277
02:01:00,767 --> 02:01:05,602
Suppose they ask where's Tony and what
party's Iooking for him? With a gun!

1278
02:01:05,772 --> 02:01:09,037
-You know something?
-I know I gotta go get a skirt.

1279
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:11,403
-Come on!
-What's the freak know?

1280
02:01:11,578 --> 02:01:15,981
PIenty! I figured somebody ought to
infiItrate PR territory and spy around.

1281
02:01:16,149 --> 02:01:18,140
I'm very Iarge with shadows.

1282
02:01:18,318 --> 02:01:21,310
I can sIip in and out of them
Iike wind through a fence.

1283
02:01:21,487 --> 02:01:24,547
-Is she making the most of it!
-You bet your fat ''A'' I am!

1284
02:01:24,724 --> 02:01:26,385
-Spill it!
-Okay.

1285
02:01:26,559 --> 02:01:30,586
I hear Chino telling the Sharks
about Tony and Bernardo's sister.

1286
02:01:30,763 --> 02:01:34,893
Then I hear Chino say, ''If it's the Iast
thing I do, I'm gonna get that PoIack.''

1287
02:01:35,068 --> 02:01:37,195
And then he pulls out the bad news.

1288
02:01:37,370 --> 02:01:39,600
-Gee!
-Them PRs won't stop.

1289
02:01:39,772 --> 02:01:41,933
-Till we stop them.
-HoId it!

1290
02:01:42,108 --> 02:01:43,735
Now, Iisten...

1291
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:47,141
...Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.

1292
02:01:47,313 --> 02:01:49,873
-We gotta find him before Chino does.
-And burns him.

1293
02:01:50,049 --> 02:01:53,143
-You cover the river. Snowboy, Doc's.
-I'll take the alleys.

1294
02:01:53,319 --> 02:01:55,344
-We'll take the streets.
-The park.

1295
02:01:55,521 --> 02:01:56,715
-The schoolyard.
-The pIayground.

1296
02:01:56,889 --> 02:01:59,153
-Let's go.
-What about me?

1297
02:02:00,426 --> 02:02:03,156
You? In and out of the shadows.

1298
02:02:03,329 --> 02:02:06,196
-Maybe you'll find Tony in one of them.
-Right!

1299
02:02:06,366 --> 02:02:08,266
Hey!

1300
02:02:09,602 --> 02:02:11,263
You done good, buddy boy.

1301
02:02:12,438 --> 02:02:16,033
Thanks, daddy-o.

1302
02:03:18,705 --> 02:03:20,104
Who is--?

1303
02:03:22,975 --> 02:03:24,567
Maria.

1304
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:29,447
Maria?

1305
02:03:30,049 --> 02:03:33,109
Maria, it's Anita. Are you in there?

1306
02:03:33,286 --> 02:03:34,913
-Maria?
-Yes.

1307
02:03:35,088 --> 02:03:37,420
Open the door. I need you.

1308
02:03:39,325 --> 02:03:40,656
No.

1309
02:03:45,565 --> 02:03:48,363
-Now you are afraid too?
-What?

1310
02:03:48,534 --> 02:03:50,229
I'll be right there.

1311
02:03:52,839 --> 02:03:56,002
We'll go. Meet me as soon as possibIe.
We'll run away.

1312
02:03:56,175 --> 02:03:59,633
-Together.
-But where?

1313
02:03:59,812 --> 02:04:02,610
The bus station.
We'll go so far they'll never find us.

1314
02:04:02,782 --> 02:04:05,717
-How can we?
-Doc will heIp. I'll get money from him.

1315
02:04:05,885 --> 02:04:08,080
-Meet me at his store.
-At Doc's, yes.

1316
02:04:08,254 --> 02:04:09,448

1321
02:04:44,657 --> 02:04:49,117
-All right. Now you know.
-And you still don't know.

1322
02:04:49,295 --> 02:04:50,592
He is one of them!

1323
02:04:50,763 --> 02:04:53,129
-No, Anita!
-Yes!

1324
02:04:55,234 --> 02:04:57,964
<i>A boy like that</i>

02:07:01,861 --> 02:07:06,457

02:07:08,601 --> 02:07:12,332

<i>And it's all that I need</i>

1358
02:07:17,410 --> 02:07:19,537
<i>Right or wrong</i>

1359
02:07:19,712 --> 02:07:23,671
<i>And he needs me too</i>

1360
02:07:25,818 --> 02:07:29,185

<i>There's nothing to be don</i>e

1363
02:07:37,964 --> 02:07:41,991
<i>Not a thing I can do</i>

1364
02:07:42,735 --> 02:07:44,999
<i>But hold him</i>

1365
02:07:45,171 --> 02:07:49,767
<i>Hold him forever</i>

1366
02:07:49,942 --> 02:07:52,672
<i>Be with him now</i>

1367
02:07:52,845 --> 02:07:55,177

1368
02:07:55,348 --> 02:07:59,785

1369
02:07:59,952 --> 02:08:03,752

1370
02:08:19,038 --> 02:08:22,235

02:08:22,408 --> 02:08:24,968

1372
02:08:25,144 --> 02:08:30,878

1373
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:36,682

1375
02:08:57,276 --> 02:08:59,210
Chino has a gun.

1376
02:08:59,378 --> 02:09:01,369
I heard the boys taIking.

1377
02:09:01,547 --> 02:09:05,950
-He's hunting for Tony.
-He's at Doc's store, waiting for me.

1378
02:09:06,118 --> 02:09:09,144
If Chino hurts him,
if he touches him, I swear I'll--

1379
02:09:09,321 --> 02:09:13,485
-You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo?
-I Iove Tony.

1380
02:09:13,859 --> 02:09:15,850
I know.

1381
02:09:16,328 --> 02:09:18,262
I Ioved Bernardo.

1382
02:09:26,105 --> 02:09:28,505
-Anybody home?
-Yes.

1383
02:09:30,076 --> 02:09:33,773
-Bernardo's sister, pIease.
-She isn't feeIing well.

1384
02:09:33,946 --> 02:09:35,914
Who is?

1385
02:09:38,184 --> 02:09:40,084
Hello, miss.

1386
02:09:40,252 --> 02:09:43,380
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't Iike
to disturb you at a time Iike this--

1387
02:09:43,556 --> 02:09:46,923
Yes, a very bad time.
If you'll excuse me, pIease.

1388
02:09:47,093 --> 02:09:50,426
-I have a coupIe of questions to ask.
-Afterwards, pIease.

1389
02:09:50,596 --> 02:09:52,757
-I must go to my brother.
-One minute!

1390
02:09:52,932 --> 02:09:55,730
-Can't you wait?
-No!

1391
02:09:56,936 --> 02:09:58,198
Now.

1392
02:09:58,370 --> 02:10:01,669
-You were at the dance Iast night--
-Will this take Iong?

1393
02:10:01,841 --> 02:10:04,071
As Iong as it has to.

1394
02:10:04,777 --> 02:10:07,302
Excuse me.

1395
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:09,641
Anita, my headache is much worse.

1396
02:10:09,815 --> 02:10:13,683
-Will you go to Doc's store?
-Don't you peopIe keep aspirin around?

1397
02:10:13,853 --> 02:10:16,287
This is something speciaI.

1398
02:10:17,923 --> 02:10:19,982
Will you go for me, Anita?

1399
02:10:25,564 --> 02:10:27,429
What shall I ask for?

1400
02:10:28,501 --> 02:10:30,469
Doc will know.

1401
02:10:30,636 --> 02:10:35,630
Tell him I have been detained
and can't get there right away...

1402
02:10:35,808 --> 02:10:38,368
...or I wouId have picked it up myseIf.

1403
02:10:49,088 --> 02:10:52,114
Excuse me. You were asking?

1404
02:10:53,325 --> 02:10:58,285
Yeah. At the gym Iast night, your
brother got into a heavy argument...

1405
02:10:58,464 --> 02:11:01,365
...because you danced
with the wrong boy.

1406
02:11:03,135 --> 02:11:06,536
-Yes.
-Who was the boy?

1407
02:11:07,339 --> 02:11:11,742
-Another from my country.
-And his name?

1408
02:11:12,511 --> 02:11:14,411
Jose.

1409
02:11:23,622 --> 02:11:26,284
-Can't find him.
-He's down there in the cellar.

1410
02:11:26,458 --> 02:11:27,823
-Tony?
-Safe and sound.

1411
02:11:27,993 --> 02:11:30,427
-I found him.
-You warn him about Chino?

1412
02:11:30,596 --> 02:11:34,032
-What's he doing in the cellar?
-Keeping the mice company.

1413
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,395
-No sign of Chino?
-Nothing.

1414
02:11:36,569 --> 02:11:37,831
His Iuck.

1415
02:11:38,003 --> 02:11:40,494
I'll check the alleys again.
You hang here.

1416
02:11:40,673 --> 02:11:41,765
-Right.
-Okay.

1417
02:11:41,941 --> 02:11:46,344
-Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?
-Upstairs raising money for Tony.

1418
02:11:46,512 --> 02:11:48,776
-Doc ain't got no money.
-His mattress has.

1419
02:11:48,948 --> 02:11:52,748
Come on. Cut the frabber-jabber.
Grab some reading matter. PIay the juke.

1420
02:11:52,918 --> 02:11:56,786
Some of you get outside.
If you see Chino or those stinking PRs--

1421
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:10,864
-I'd Iike to see Doc.
-He ain't here.

1422
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:13,897
-Where is he?
-He went to the bank.

1423
02:12:14,073 --> 02:12:18,806
-They made a mistake in his favor.
-The banks are cIosed. Where is he?

1424
02:12:18,978 --> 02:12:22,812
You know how skinny Doc is. He sIipped
in through the night deposit sIot.

1425
02:12:22,982 --> 02:12:24,973
And got stuck haIfway in.

1426
02:12:25,150 --> 02:12:28,711
Which indicates there's
no telling when he'll be back.

1427
02:12:42,334 --> 02:12:43,631
Where you going?

1428
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:48,768
-Downstairs.
-Didn't I tell you he ain't here?

1429
02:12:48,941 --> 02:12:51,000
I'd Iike to see for myseIf.

1430
02:12:53,545 --> 02:12:55,604
PIease.

1431
02:12:58,217 --> 02:13:00,208
PIease.

1432
02:13:03,789 --> 02:13:07,486
-Will you Iet me pass?
-She's too dark to pass.

1433
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:09,423
-Don't.
-PIease don't.

1434
02:13:13,232 --> 02:13:15,223
-Listen, you!
-We're Iistening.

1435
02:13:15,401 --> 02:13:18,529
Look, I gotta give
a friend of yours a message.

1436
02:13:18,704 --> 02:13:20,535
-I gotta tell Tony--
-He ain't here.

1437
02:13:20,706 --> 02:13:22,037
-I know he is.
-Who says he is?

1438
02:13:22,207 --> 02:13:23,435
-Who's it from?
-Never mind.

1439
02:13:23,609 --> 02:13:28,945
-CouIdn't be from Chino, couId it?
-Don't you understand? I want to heIp!

1440
02:13:29,114 --> 02:13:32,675
-Bernardo's girI wants to heIp?
-Even a greaseball's got feeIings.

1441
02:13:32,851 --> 02:13:34,682
-But she wants to heIp get Tony.
-No!

1442
02:13:34,853 --> 02:13:38,516
-Not much. Bernardo's tramp.
-Bernardo's pig!

1443
02:13:38,691 --> 02:13:40,818
-You lying spic!
-Don't do that.

1444
02:13:40,993 --> 02:13:42,187
-GoId tooth!
-Pierced ear!

1445
02:13:42,361 --> 02:13:44,352
-Don't!
-GarIic mouth.

1446
02:13:47,066 --> 02:13:49,432
-I want to heIp!
-Come on!

1447
02:13:59,878 --> 02:14:01,345
Come on!

1448
02:14:05,651 --> 02:14:08,051
-Let's get her!
-Oh, no, you don't.

1449
02:14:11,557 --> 02:14:14,685
-Come on.
-Come on!

1450
02:14:20,099 --> 02:14:21,862
Stop it!

1451
02:14:26,305 --> 02:14:28,830
What are you doing there?

1452
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:50,126
Bernardo was right.

1453
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:57,097
If one of you was lying
in the street bIeeding...

1454
02:14:57,269 --> 02:14:59,931
...I'd waIk by and spit on you!

1455
02:15:00,105 --> 02:15:04,508
-She'll tell Chino Tony's in the cellar!
-Don't you touch me!

1456
02:15:07,246 --> 02:15:11,080
I got a message
for your American buddy.

1457
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:15,744
You tell that murderer
that Maria's never going to meet him!

1458
02:15:15,921 --> 02:15:19,687
You tell him that Chino
found out about them...

1459
02:15:19,858 --> 02:15:21,985
...and shot her!

1460
02:15:22,661 --> 02:15:24,856
She's dead!

1461
02:15:28,667 --> 02:15:31,636
When do you kids stop?

1462
02:15:31,804 --> 02:15:35,262
You make this worId Iousy!

1463
02:15:35,441 --> 02:15:37,807
We didn't make it, Doc.

1464
02:15:39,344 --> 02:15:41,710
Get out of here.

1465
02:16:11,543 --> 02:16:13,204
Maria?

1466
02:16:13,378 --> 02:16:16,040
Doc, I thought I heard--
You got it!

1467
02:16:16,215 --> 02:16:19,651
-Yes, I got it.
-Doc, you're a paI.

1468
02:16:19,818 --> 02:16:24,448
You're the best friend a guy ever had.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

1469
02:16:24,623 --> 02:16:27,615
-Forget that.
-No, I'll never! I couIdn't.

1470
02:16:27,793 --> 02:16:30,887
You know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?

1471
02:16:31,063 --> 02:16:35,193
We'll have kids and name them after you.
Even the girIs, so when you visit--

1472
02:16:35,367 --> 02:16:37,267
Wake up!

1473
02:16:38,237 --> 02:16:41,604
Is this the only way
to get through to you?

1474
02:16:41,773 --> 02:16:46,073
Do just what you all do,
bust Iike a hot-water pipe?

1475
02:16:46,245 --> 02:16:47,610
What's got into you?

1476
02:16:47,779 --> 02:16:52,409
Why do you kids Iive
Iike there's a war on?

1477
02:16:55,621 --> 02:16:58,055
Why do you kill?

1478
02:17:01,393 --> 02:17:03,293
I toId you how it happened.

1479
02:17:04,863 --> 02:17:06,922
Maria understands.

1480
02:17:07,099 --> 02:17:11,468
-I thought you did too.
-Maria understands nothing.

1481
02:17:12,170 --> 02:17:13,831
Ever again.

1482
02:17:14,006 --> 02:17:16,634
There is no Maria, Tony.

1483
02:17:19,912 --> 02:17:21,174
What?

1484
02:17:23,015 --> 02:17:25,711
-I can't.
-No, no, Doc.

1485
02:17:25,884 --> 02:17:28,182
Now, tell me. What is it?

1486
02:17:29,221 --> 02:17:31,849
That was Anita upstairs.

1487
02:17:32,357 --> 02:17:35,758
Chino found out about you and Maria...

1488
02:17:36,695 --> 02:17:38,595
...and he killed her.

1489
02:17:52,711 --> 02:17:54,235
Maria....

1490
02:18:01,987 --> 02:18:03,682
Not Maria, Doc.

1491
02:18:04,957 --> 02:18:06,322
She's....

1492
02:18:13,365 --> 02:18:15,663
Chino! Chino!

1493
02:18:18,303 --> 02:18:20,771
Come and get me too, Chino!

1494
02:18:23,208 --> 02:18:25,369
Chino!

1495
02:18:27,346 --> 02:18:30,782
Chino!

1496
02:18:33,085 --> 02:18:37,283
-Chino! Come and get me too, Chino!
-Tony!

1497
02:18:37,456 --> 02:18:39,481
-Who's that?
-Anybodys. Come on.

1498
02:18:39,658 --> 02:18:41,148
Get out of here!

1499
02:18:41,326 --> 02:18:45,092
-Chino, come and get me, damn you!
-What are you doing?

1500
02:18:45,263 --> 02:18:47,356
Get out of here! Chino!

1501
02:18:47,532 --> 02:18:49,056
Come with me. We'll find--

1502
02:18:49,234 --> 02:18:51,361
It ain't pIaying anymore!
Can't you get that?

1503
02:18:51,536 --> 02:18:55,734
-But the gang--
-You're a girI! Be a girI and beat it!

1504
02:18:59,578 --> 02:19:01,478
Chino!

1505
02:19:02,547 --> 02:19:06,074
Come on, Chino! Get me too!

1506
02:19:06,251 --> 02:19:07,980

1512
02:19:46,425 --> 02:19:47,722
Maria?

1513
02:19:49,027 --> 02:19:50,324

02:20:31,603 --> 02:20:34,401
I didn't beIieve hard enough.

1518
02:20:34,573 --> 02:20:36,871
Loving is enough.

1519
02:20:37,042 --> 02:20:38,737
Not here.

1520
02:20:39,745 --> 02:20:44,148
-They won't Iet us be.
-Then we'll get away.

1521
02:20:47,652 --> 02:20:49,051
Yeah.

1522
02:20:49,221 --> 02:20:50,415
-We can.
-Yes.

1523
02:20:50,589 --> 02:20:52,819
-We will.
-Yes.

1524
02:20:53,859 --> 02:20:58,421
<i>Hold my hand</i>

1525

Stay back!

1530
02:22:17,976 --> 02:22:20,911
How do you fire this gun, Chino?

1531
02:22:21,079 --> 02:22:24,276
Just by pulling this IittIe trigger?

1532
02:22:24,449 --> 02:22:27,145
How many bullets are Ieft, Chino?

1533
02:22:27,552 --> 02:22:29,076
Enough for you?

1534
02:22:29,254 --> 02:22:30,619
And you?

1535
02:22:32,224 --> 02:22:33,555
All of you!

1536
02:22:33,725 --> 02:22:37,923
You all killed him.
And my brother and Riff.

1537
02:22:38,096 --> 02:22:40,587
Not with bullets and guns.

1538
02:22:40,765 --> 02:22:42,756
With hate!

1539
02:22:43,101 --> 02:22:47,231
Well, I can kill too
because now I have hate!

1540
02:22:47,405 --> 02:22:50,670
How many can I kill, Chino? How many?

1541
02:22:50,842 --> 02:22:53,675
And still have one bullet Ieft for me?

1542
02:23:00,385 --> 02:23:02,819
No!

1543
02:23:15,467 --> 02:23:18,459
Don't you touch him!
