Watch this shot now! Shoot, man! Go!

5
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:12,912
Yeah!

6
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:13,701
- Chickie! Chick, chick, chick!
- Boy! Jet boy!

7
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:15,369
Jet boy!

8
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:27,722
Jet, Jet, Jets!

9
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,808
- Come back!
- Come over here!

10
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:31,885
Chickens!

11
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,409
Beat it!

12
00:14:58,578 --> 00:14:59,921
Yeah!

13
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,714
All right, go, Jets!

14
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:10,764
Snowboy!

15
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:22,398
Come on!

16
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:32,286
Beat it!

17
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:44,249
Chico! Andale, chico!

18
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,630
Okay, here we go!

19
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,379
Over here, A-Rab!

20
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,251
Jets! Jets!

21
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,513
Bernardo! Indio! Chaco, come on!

22
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:40,684
Jets, come on! Follow me, baby.

23
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,079
- Mira, mira, mira!
- Jets!

24
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:05,334
Andale, Chico!

25
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:08,174
Come on, Jets!

26
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,260
Hey, Jets!

27
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,216
Hello!

28
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:17,555
Jets, come on! Julio!

29
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,477
Come on!

30
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,685
Jets!

31
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:30,188
Come on, boys!

32
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:33,032
Come on, now!

33
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,781
Jets!

34
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:59,577
Break it up, you punks! Cut it out!
Come on, guys! Break it up, I said!

35
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,905
Come on, break it up! Come on!

36
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:04,832
How many times have I told you
punks to cut this stuff out?

37
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:09,004
- Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank!
- Top of the day, Lt. Schrank.

38
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:12,582
- And Officer Krupke.
- Top of the day, Officer Krupke.

39
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:15,509
- I'll give you the top of the head.
- Hey you, get down!

40
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,506
- But we're having such fun.
- We enjoy the playground.

41
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:21,512
See, it keeps us deprived children
off of the foul city streets.

42
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:22,638
Shut up!

43
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:24,560
And born like we was
on the hot pavement.

44
00:19:24,636 --> 00:19:27,435
- You wanna get your skull broke?
- Hey, Baby John, come here!

45
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:29,353
Come here!

46
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:35,238
All right!

47
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:37,824
Now, which one of these
Puerto Ricans bloodied you?

48
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:41,361
- Sir...
- Which one?

49
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:43,366
Excuse me, sir.

50
00:19:43,613 --> 00:19:45,365
As a matter of fact...

51
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:48,702
we suspicion that the
job was done by a cop.

52
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:50,620
- Two cops.
- At the very least.

53
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:51,670
Impossible.

54
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:54,590
In America, nothing is impossible.

55
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,381
All right, wise guys...

56
00:19:58,044 --> 00:19:59,637
now, you listen to me!

57
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:01,055
All of you!

58
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:03,725
You hoodlums don't own these streets.

59
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,304
And I've had all the roughhouse I'm
gonna put up with around here!

60
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:11,984
You wanna kill each other, kill each other!
But you ain't gonna do it on my beat!

61
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,060
- Are there any questions?
- Yes, sir.

62
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:17,397
Would you mind translating
that into Spanish?

63
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:23,028
Get your friends out of here, Bernardo.

64
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:25,405
And stay out!

65
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,127
Please.

66
00:20:34,414 --> 00:20:35,882
Okay, Sharks.

67
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,634
Vámonos.

68
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,596
Boy, oh boy!

69
00:20:49,762 --> 00:20:52,732
As if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough!

70
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:57,103
Now, look, fellas. Fellas!

71
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,272
Look, let's be reasonable...

72
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:01,904
if I don't get a little law
and order around here...

73
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,577
I get busted down to
a traffic corner...

74
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:07,121
and your friend don't
like traffic corners.

75
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:09,164
So, that means you're gonna
start makin' nice...

76
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,242
with the PR's from now on.

77
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,662
I said nice! Get it?

78
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:17,465
'Cause if you don't...

79
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,465
and I catch any of you doin' any
more brawlin' in my territory...

80
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:24,218
I'm gonna personally beat the livin'
crud out of each and every one of you...

81
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,016
and see that you go to
the can and rot there!

82
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:34,269
- Say good-bye to the nice boys, Krupke.
- Good-bye, boys.

83
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:40,438
"Good-bye, boys."

84
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,816
Jail? Gee.

85
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,568
"You hoodlums don't own the streets."

86
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:48,074
Go play in the park.
Keep off of the grass.

87
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:50,156
- Get out of the house!
- Keep off the block.

88
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,991
- Get outta here.
- Keep off the world!

89
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:54,419
A gang that don't own
the street is nothin'!

90
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:55,996
We do own it!

91
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,457
Come on, Jets, round out!

92
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:04,049
- Not you, Anybodys! Beat it!
- Riff, you gotta let me in the gang!

93
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:07,803
Didn't you just see me? I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.

94
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:10,101
How else she gonna get
a guy to touch her?

95
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,430
- You dirty rat!
- Come on, the road, little girl! The road!

96
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:14,806
Beat it!

97
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:18,901
- Beat it!
- Okay, come on.

98
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,030
Okay, now listen!

99
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,410
Now, we fought hard for this turf,
and we ain't just gonna give it up.

100
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:32,411
The Emeralds claimed
it, we shot 'em out.

101
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,494
The Hawks, remember? They tried to take
it away, we knocked them down the cellar.

102
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:38,705
- But these PR's are different.
- They multiply. Like cockroaches.

103
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:40,756
- Shut the door!
- They're eatin' all the food.

104
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:43,460
- Breathin' all the air.
- Help! I'm drowning in tamale.

105
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:46,092
And you heard what that Lt. Schrank said...

106
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,515
we gotta make nice with
them Puerto Ricans or else.

107
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,809
We gotta let 'em move in
right under our noses...

108
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:53,978
- and take it all away from us or else.
- No!

109
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:55,896
You're damn right, no!

110
00:22:56,222 --> 00:23:00,352
So what're we gonna do, buddy boys?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

111
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:02,061
We're gonna speed back!

112
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:05,607
We're gonna move like lightnin', and
we're gonna clean them Sharks up...

113
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,907
once and for all.

114
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:09,782
So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!

115
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:14,453
We're gonna do it in one all-out fight.

116
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:17,703
- A rumble! Chop, chop!
- Now cool, Action Boy.

117
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,632
The Sharks want a piece of this world, too.
And they're real down boys.

118
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,959
They might ask for blades...

119
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:27,341
- zip guns.
- Zip guns?

120
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:32,680
I ain't finalizin' and
sayin' they will, Baby John.

121
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:36,979
I'm just sayin' that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.

122
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:40,024
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

123
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,773
- I say go, go!
- I say mix!

124
00:23:42,852 --> 00:23:44,149
- I say sock 'em!
- Tear them!

125
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:48,904
- Yeah, but if they say blades or guns...
- I say let's just forget the whole thing.

126
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:51,202
- What?
- What do you say, Riff?

127
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:56,624
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got.

128
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,954
I wanna hold it like we
always held it, with skin!

129
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,333
But if they say blades, I say blades.

130
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,511
If they say guns, I say guns.

131
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:12,302
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!

132
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:16,348
- To sail! To hold the sky!
- Then rev us off! Voom va-voom!

133
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:19,393
Okay, cats, we rumble!

134
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:21,141
Now...

135
00:24:21,682 --> 00:24:23,525
protocality calls for a war council...

136
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:26,104
between us and the Sharks
to set the whole thing up.

137
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:29,031
So I will personally give
the bad news to Bernardo.

138
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,325
- You gotta take a lieutenant with you.
- That's me.

139
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,073
- That's Tony.
- Who needs Tony?

140
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:34,699
We need Tony!

141
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:37,532
He's got a rep that's bigger
than the whole West Side!

142
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:40,710
- He don't belong no more.
- Now, cut it, Action!

143
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:44,047
- Me and Tony started the Jets.
- So where is he?

144
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:47,633
- How come he takes a lousy, stinkin' job?
- Youth Board corrupted him.

145
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:49,756
- Yeah, temporary sickness!
- Wait and see.

146
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:52,429
Remember them fists the day
we clobbered the Emeralds?

147
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:55,349
- He saved my ever-loving neck!
- Sure! He'll do it again, too!

148
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:58,598
He always came through for
us and he always will.

00:25:44,682 --> 00:25:47,856

- A-Rab, I'm gonna make nice with him.

168
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:50,358

- Tony, you're not even listenin'.
- I read you loud and clear, Riff.

207
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:05,730
- Then why don't you say somethin'?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

208
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:08,900
- You're my buddy, my pal, my best friend!
- Womb to tomb?

209
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,481
Birth to earth.

210
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,155
That's why you gotta come to the
dance tonight and stand up with me.

211
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,658
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.

212
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:20,570
Riff, did you ever stop to figure...

213
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:23,748
how many bubbles there are in one
bottle of this here soda pop?

214
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:25,621
Tony, this is important!

215
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:27,918
Everything's important, Riff...

216
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,709
you, me, the sweet guy I work for.

217
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:33,674
The Sharks walk bad. They bite hard.

218
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,962
- And if we don't stop them now...
- Here! Work for a living.

219
00:27:37,753 --> 00:27:41,883
How do you like that? Four and a half
years I live with a buddy and his family.

220
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:44,014
I think I'm diggin' a guy's character.

221
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:48,146
Boy, am I a victim of
disappointment in you!

222
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:51,024
End your sufferin', little man.

223
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,694
Why don't you just pack up
your gear and move out?

224
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,487
'Cause your ma's hot for me.

225
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:02,369
No! It's 'cause I hate livin'
with my buggin' uncle!

226
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,698
- Come on!
- Come on, uncle!

227
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:07,366
Now...

228
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:09,873
go play games with the Jets.

229
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:12,079
And why not? They're the greatest.

230
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:13,710
Ain't they?

231
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:15,332
Were.

232
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:19,595
You found somethin' better?

233
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:22,390
No. Not yet, but...

234
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:25,054
But What?

235
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,308
You won't dig it, Riff.

236
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,147
So try me.

237
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,059
Come on, Tony, try me.

238
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:38,029
Okay.

239
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:44,909
Every single night for the
last month, I wake up...

240
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:47,573
and I'm reaching out.

241
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,453
- For what?
- I don't know.

242
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:53,795
A dame?

243
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:58,168
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...

244
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,010
but it's comin'.

245
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,302
What is?

246
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:03,597
I don't know. It...

247
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,718
it's like the kick I used
to get from bein' a Jet.

248
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:09,553
Now you're talkin'!

249
00:29:09,637 --> 00:29:11,981
Man, without a gang, you're an orphan.

250
00:29:12,056 --> 00:29:14,650
With a gang, you walk in
twos, threes, fours...

251
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:16,022
and your crew is the best...

252
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:18,775
when you're a Jet, you're out
in the sun, buddy boy...

253
00:29:18,854 --> 00:29:20,026
you're home free home!

254
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:21,857
Riff, I've had it!

255
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:26,411
Tony...

256
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:29,282
Tony, look at me, will ya?

257
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:31,367
- Come on, look at me.
- I'm lookin' at you.

258
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,296
Now, I never asked the time
of day from a clock, did I?

259
00:29:36,372 --> 00:29:40,252
I never asked nothin' from
nobody, but I'm askin' you...

260
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:42,170
come to the dance tonight.

261
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:45,556
I promised Doc I'd clean
up the store tonight.

262
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:47,633
Then do it after the dance.

263
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,391
Tony, I already told the
guys you'd be there.

264
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,398
If you don't show,
I'll be marked lousy.

265
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:57,192
What time'd you tell 'em?

266
00:29:57,518 --> 00:29:58,690
10:00.

267
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:01,188
For me, Tony, for Riff!

268
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:07,077
- 10:00 it is.
- Womb to tomb?

269
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:09,200
Birth to earth, and I'll
live to regret this.

270
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,625
Who knows? Maybe what you're waitin'
for'll be twitchin' at the dance tonight.

271
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,327

317
00:32:30,587 --> 00:32:33,056
♪ Maybe tonight ♪

318
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,644
♪ Maybe tonight ♪

319
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,233
Por favor, Anita, you are my friend.

320
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:52,943
- Stop it, Maria.
- You must make the neck lower.

321
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:54,573
And you must stop heckling me.

322
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:57,327
We are working on our time
now, not the old lady's.

323
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,166
- One inch. How much can one little inch do?
- Too much.

324
00:33:02,828 --> 00:33:06,878
Anita, it is now to be a dress for
dancing, no longer for praying!

325
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:11,178
Listen, with those boys, you can
start in dancing and end up praying.

326
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,264
Querida, one little inch.

327
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:18,515
- Bernardo made me promise!
- Bernardo!

328
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:22,098
One month have I been in this country.
Do I ever even touch excitement?

329
00:33:22,181 --> 00:33:24,980
I sew in this place all day.
I sit at home all night.

330
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:27,652
For what did my fine
brother bring me here?

331
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:30,151
- To marry Chino.
- Chino.

332
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:34,698
- When I look at Chino, nothing happens.
- What do you expect to happen?

333
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:37,155
I don't know. Something.

334
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:42,118
What happens when you look at Bernardo?

335
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:45,204
It's when I don't look that it happens.

336
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:53,550
I think I will tell Mama and Papa
about you and Nardo in the balcony...

337
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:54,630
of the movies!

338
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:57,091
- I will rip this to shreds!
- No!

339
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:00,894
But if you perhaps could
manage to lower the neck...

340
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:03,397
Next year.

341
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:05,314
I hate that dress!

342
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,644
Then don't wear it, and don't come
to the dance with us tonight.

343
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:10,104
Don't come?

344
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:17,362
- Could we not dye it red at least?
- No, we could not.

345
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:21,247
White is for babies.

346
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,835
I will be the only one
there in a white...

347
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:35,463
Sí.

348
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:38,973
It is a beautiful dress.

349
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:40,763
I love you!

350
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:45,184
- Are you ready, ladies?
- Nardo, come in.

351
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:46,811
Is it not beautiful?

352
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:48,983
Yes.

353
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:51,945
- Very.
- I didn't quite hear.

354
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,440
Very beautiful.

355
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:58,403
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.

356
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:02,953
- But this is a shop for ladies.
- We won't bite you till we know you better.

357
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:08,208
Chino, you will keep both eyes on Maria
tonight in case I cannot. You too, Anita.

358
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:12,542
- My brother is a silly watchdog.
- My sister is a precious jewel.

359
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,925
What am I? Cut glass?

360
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,514
Nardo, it is most important that I have a
wonderful time at the dancing tonight.

361
00:35:22,593 --> 00:35:23,765
It is?

362
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:26,764
Because tonight is the real
beginning of my life...

363
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,975
as a young lady of America.

364
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:34,527
Inserted comments without subtitles
(about 3,5 minutes)

365
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:33,930
Let's go!

366
00:40:00,622 --> 00:40:01,874
Get outta here!

367
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:31,074
Nardo. Cómo está?

368
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:34,869
Chino. Chino!

369
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:38,581
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!

370
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:42,380
Maria.

371
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,176
Look what I got.

372
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:48,754
Maria, these are some of
my friends you've not met.

373
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:50,756
Pick up.

374
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,179
This is Loco.

375
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:54,680
- Mucho gusto.
- Encantada.

376
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,388
- Teresita. My sister Maria.
- Good evening.

377
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:01,021
- And this is Luis and Rosa.
- Encantada. Rosalie, ai.

378
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:02,442
Oye, Nardo.

379
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,829
All right, boys and girls. All right.

380
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:17,662
Attention, please!

381
00:41:20,118 --> 00:41:21,461
Attention!

382
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:24,957
Come here.

383
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:26,717
Thank you.

384
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:29,762
My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.

385
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:32,089
It's all for you, glad hand.

386
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,388
I know all of you boys and girls...

387
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:38,095
are here because you want
to make new friends...

388
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:41,057
and get closer to old ones.

389
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:42,391
Yeah!

390
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:47,313
So, tonight, kids, we're
gonna do something special.

391
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,490
We're gonna have a get-together dance!

392
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:51,900
Ginger! Peachy!

393
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:56,242
All right, all right,
now, kids, kids...

394
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:59,416
I want you to form two circles.

395
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:00,538
- How many?
- Two.

396
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:03,962
Boys on the outside, and
girls on the inside.

397
00:42:04,162 --> 00:42:05,334
Where are you?

398
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:08,504
All right.

399
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,010
Now...

400
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,346
when the music stops...

401
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:18,349
each boy dances with whichever
girl is opposite, okay?

402
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:19,560
Okay!

403
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,935
Two circles, kids!

404
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:28,691
Well, it won't hurt you to try.

405
00:42:29,438 --> 00:42:31,361
It hurts. It hurts! It hurts.

406
00:42:31,898 --> 00:42:33,150
Snowboy.

407
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:55,721
I'm with it.

408
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:20,155
That's it, kids! Keep the ball rolling.

409
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:24,668
Round she goes, and where
she stops, nobody knows.

410
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:26,586
All right, here we go.

411
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:32,338
Boys to my right, and girls to my left.

412
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:04,704
- Mambo!
- Mambo!

413
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:06,250
Go!

414
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:23,977
Tony!

415
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,363
Mambo!

416
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,130
Mambo!

417
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:17,238
You're not thinking I'm someone else?

418
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:19,577
I know you are not.

419
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:25,625
Or that we've met before?

420
00:50:26,534 --> 00:50:28,252
I know we have not.

421
00:50:29,704 --> 00:50:31,047
I felt...

422
00:50:31,873 --> 00:50:35,047
I knew something never before was
gonna happen, had to happen...

423
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:36,469
but this is so much more.

424
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:38,512
My hands are cold.

425
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:44,470
Yours, too.

426
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:53,774
So warm.

427
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,282
So beautiful.

428
00:51:02,278 --> 00:51:03,621
Beautiful.

429
00:51:10,453 --> 00:51:12,376
It's so much to believe.

430
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:16,050
You're not making a joke?

431
00:51:17,919 --> 00:51:20,843
I have not yet learned
how to joke that way.

432
00:51:22,298 --> 00:51:24,300
I think now I never will.

433
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:02,047
- Get your hands off, American!
- Nardo!

434
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,803
- Stay away from my sister.
- Sister?

435
00:52:03,882 --> 00:52:06,226
- Couldn't you see he's one of them?
- I saw only him.

436
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:08,429
They want one thing from
a Puerto Rican girl.

437
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:09,637
- That's a lie!
- Later, Tony!

438
00:52:09,721 --> 00:52:11,439
- Get away!
- Don't listen.

439
00:52:11,514 --> 00:52:13,608
She'll listen to me before
she listens to you.

440
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:14,900
If you two want to settle this...

441
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,775
Please, boys!
Everything was going so well.

442
00:52:17,854 --> 00:52:21,199
Now, come on! We're all here to
have a good time, aren't we?

443
00:52:21,274 --> 00:52:22,651
Nardo...

444
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:29,412
Take her out of here. We're going home.

445
00:52:29,491 --> 00:52:33,291
- Nardo, it is my first dance.
- Please. We are family. Now go.

446
00:52:44,672 --> 00:52:46,094
Come, Maria.

447
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:52,896
Maria.

448
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:02,024
- I don't want you.
- I want you, though.

449
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,204
I want you for a war council.
Jets and Sharks.

450
00:53:15,703 --> 00:53:18,832
- The pleasure is mine.
- Let's go outside.

451
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:22,294
I would not leave the ladies here
alone with your kind around.

452
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:24,050
We will meet you at midnight.

453
00:53:24,712 --> 00:53:26,339
Doc's candy store?

454
00:53:27,132 --> 00:53:29,180
And no jazz before then.

455
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:31,895
I understand the rules...

456
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:33,889
native boy.

457
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:36,482
Ice.

458
00:53:41,855 --> 00:53:45,280
- Doc's at midnight. Spread the word.
- Right, daddy-o.

459
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:52,745

Now, I do not say these things
to spoil your evening...

487
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:33,993
or to hear myself talk.

488
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:36,787
- I am here longer than you, Maria.
- Sí, Nardo.

489
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,616
Someday, when you're an old
married woman with five kids...

490
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:43,203
you can tell me what to do.
But right now it is the other way around.

491
00:56:43,286 --> 00:56:44,788
Now go to bed.

492
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,924
He's the old married woman.

493
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:56,682
You know, she has a mother.
Also a father.

494
00:56:56,758 --> 00:56:59,261
They do not know this country
any better than she does.

495
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:02,689
And you do not know it at all.
Girls here are free to have fun.

496
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:07,611
- She is in America now.
- Puerto Rico is in America now.

497
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:15,277
Sometimes I don't know which is
thicker, your skull or your accent.

498
00:57:19,197 --> 00:57:20,949
Vámonos, muchachos!

499
00:57:21,366 --> 00:57:23,789
Let them wait. Is Maria all right?

500
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:26,838
- I should be so all right.
- It will not happen again.

501
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:29,962
Pepe, Indio, after tonight,
things will be settled.

502
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,885
- First settle your stomach.
- Never mind my stomach.

503
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,841
- I mind your nose and your head broken.
- Broken?

504
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:40,969
Sure! They use Maria for an
excuse to start World War III.

505
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:45,224
- It is more than that.
- More than what? She was only dancing.

506
00:57:45,306 --> 00:57:49,652
- With an American who's really a Polack.
- Says the Spic.

507
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,823
You are not so cute.

508
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:56,359
- That Tony is.
- And he works.

509
00:57:56,442 --> 00:57:59,070
- A delivery boy.
- And what are you?

510
00:57:59,153 --> 00:58:00,200
An assistant.

511
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:02,953
Sí, and Chino makes half
of what the Polack makes.

512
00:58:03,032 --> 00:58:05,205
Here comes the whole commercial!

513
00:58:05,284 --> 00:58:07,582
Your mother's a Pole,
your father's a Swede...

514
00:58:07,662 --> 00:58:09,881
But you were born here,
that's all that you need.

515
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:14,052
You are an American.
But us? Foreigners!

516
00:58:14,127 --> 00:58:16,505
Lice! Cockroaches!

517
00:58:16,587 --> 00:58:17,804
But it's true!

518
00:58:18,506 --> 00:58:21,476
When I think of how I thought
it would be for us here...

519
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:25,522
- we came like children believing...
- Trusting with our hearts open!

520
00:58:25,596 --> 00:58:29,692
- With our arms open.
- You came with your mouth open.

521
00:58:31,018 --> 00:58:33,112
You're the Spic, and you
go back in handcuffs.

522
00:58:33,187 --> 00:58:34,939
I'm going back in a Cadillac.

523
00:58:35,022 --> 00:58:36,945
- Air-conditioned!
- Built-in bar!

524
00:58:37,024 --> 00:58:38,742
- Telephone!
- And television!

525
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:40,070
Compatible color.

526
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:43,865
If you had all that here, why would
you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?

527
00:58:43,948 --> 00:58:47,578
Or even if you didn't have all that here,
why would you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?

528
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,288
- It's so good here?
- It's so good there?

529
00:58:50,371 --> 00:58:51,873
We had nothing!

530
00:58:52,457 --> 00:58:55,711
We still have nothing,
only more expensive.

531
00:58:58,927 --> 00:59:02,927
Inserted comments without subtitles
(about 2 minutes)

532
01:01:45,753 --> 01:01:49,724
- Anita Josefina.
- No. it's plain Anita now.

533
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:53,303
- Margarita, et cetera.
- You leave me alone. At least I let...

534
01:01:54,053 --> 01:01:56,431
Once an immigrant, always an immigrant!

535
01:01:56,514 --> 01:01:59,518
Look! Instead of a shampoo,
she's been brainwashed!

536
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,647
Stop it!

537
01:02:00,726 --> 01:02:04,026
She has given up Puerto Rico, and
now she's queer for Uncle Sam.

538
01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:05,572
No.

539
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:07,324

Come on! Chino!

598
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:09,709
What are you doing?

599
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:20,554
- Meet me on the roof later.
- "Meet me on the roof later."

600
01:07:20,713 --> 01:07:23,182
- Will you or won't you?
- "Will you or won't you?"

601
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:27,303
Will you?

602
01:07:27,386 --> 01:07:30,230
You have your big,
important war council.

603
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:32,183
The council...

604
01:07:32,808 --> 01:07:33,900
or me?

605
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:35,569
First, one...

606
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:38,530
and then the other.

607
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:42,819
No. I'm an American girl now.

608
01:07:43,152 --> 01:07:44,620
I don't wait.

609
01:07:44,903 --> 01:07:47,372
Back home, women know their place.

610
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:50,042
Back home, little boys
don't have war councils.

611
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:51,915
But they do here.

612
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:55,836
You want me to be an
American, don't you?

613
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:02,008
Buenas noches, Anita
Josefina Teresita...

614
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:05,091
Beatriz del Carmen
Margarita et cetera...

615
01:08:05,174 --> 01:08:07,222
et cetera, et cetera!

616
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:09,311
Immigrant!

617
01:08:10,012 --> 01:08:11,605
Buenas noches!

618
01:08:13,849 --> 01:08:16,443
- Buenas noches, Maria!
- Adiós, Maria!

619
01:08:16,769 --> 01:08:18,442
Good night, Maria!

620
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:20,106
Good night!

621
01:08:31,825 --> 01:08:32,997
Maria!

622
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:52,976
- Maria!
- Quiet.

623
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:01,818
- Come down!
- No.

624
01:09:01,897 --> 01:09:03,524
- Maria!
- Please.

625
01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:06,194
My mother and father will wake up.

626
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,158
Just for a minute.

627
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:11,324
- A minute is not enough.
- For an hour, then.

628
01:09:11,407 --> 01:09:12,454
I cannot.

629
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:15,377
Then forever. Then I'm coming up.

630
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:16,833
Maria!

631
01:09:18,831 --> 01:09:20,174
Momentito, papá.

632
01:09:20,499 --> 01:09:22,547
- Now see what you've done?
- Momentito, Maria.

633
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:23,878
Cállate.

634
01:09:26,213 --> 01:09:29,888
- It is dangerous. If Bernardo knew...
- We will let him know.

635
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:32,015
I'm not one of 'em, Maria.

636
01:09:32,177 --> 01:09:35,522
But you are not one of us,
and I am not one of you.

637
01:09:35,597 --> 01:09:38,146
- To me, you're all the beautiful...
- Maruca!

Maruca?

His pet name for me.

01:09:51,196 --> 01:09:53,369
I like him, and he will like me.

642
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:55,497
No.

643
01:09:56,034 --> 01:09:58,787
He's like Bernardo, afraid.

644
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:03,383

- Maybe they're too chicken to show.
- We got time, A-Rab.

720
01:15:33,705 --> 01:15:36,083
- Riff and Ice ain't even here yet.
- Come on, come on!

721
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:38,464
- He don't use a switchblade.
- What?

722
01:15:38,543 --> 01:15:41,422
- He don't even use an atomic ray gun.
- Who don't?

723
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:45,305
- Captain Marvel. Gee, I love him.
- So marry him!

724
01:15:45,634 --> 01:15:48,513
I ain't never gonna get married.
Too noisy.

725

You ain't never gonna get married.

726
01:15:50,388 --> 01:15:52,811
- Too ugly.
- Pow! Pow!

727
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:56,145
Wacko jacko!
Down goes a teenage hoodlum.

728
01:15:57,312 --> 01:16:00,407
Gee, could a real zip gun
make you do like that?

729
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:03,744
No, the zip gun could make you do.
You better wear diapers!

730
01:16:04,277 --> 01:16:07,030
Go walk the streets like your sister.

731
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:11,039
Listen, jailbait, I licked you
twice, and I can do it again!

732
01:16:16,915 --> 01:16:19,168
Come on, Anybodys, knock it off.

733
01:16:19,251 --> 01:16:22,972
- Riff's here.
- Okay, cats, all present and accounted for?

734
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:25,344
I'm really proud of you.
You did good at the dance.

735
01:16:25,423 --> 01:16:28,677
- So where are they?
- Unwind, Action. Any sign of Tony?

736
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,852
Invisible, man.

737
01:16:29,928 --> 01:16:32,181
What do you think the
Sharks are gonna ask for?

738
01:16:32,264 --> 01:16:34,483
- Mercy.
- Just rubber hoses maybe.

739
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:35,980
Relax, little man.

740
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:38,061
- You tell him, daddy-o.
- I'm ready.

741
01:16:38,144 --> 01:16:39,361
Easy. Cool.

742
01:16:40,397 --> 01:16:41,569
Cracko jacko!

743
01:16:41,773 --> 01:16:45,073
Riff, look, in a tight spot, you're
gonna need every man you can get.

744
01:16:45,151 --> 01:16:47,995
- No.
- An American tragedy.

745
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:50,032
- Pow!
- Poo.

746
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:54,874
Look, when the Sharks
come, you chicks cut out.

747
01:16:54,953 --> 01:16:58,173
We might, and then again, we might not.

748
01:16:58,665 --> 01:17:00,963
This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.

749
01:17:01,501 --> 01:17:04,425
I and Velma ain't kid stuff neither.

750
01:17:04,754 --> 01:17:07,507
- Are we, Vel?
- No, thank you.

751
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:11,015
And you can punctuate it.

752
01:17:13,805 --> 01:17:16,684
What are we poopin'
around with dumb broads?

753
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:18,734

Who me?

758
01:17:27,152 --> 01:17:29,405
Top of the evening, Officer Krupke.

759
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:32,286
- You.
- Who, me, sir?

760
01:17:32,616 --> 01:17:34,960
Yeah, you. Didn't you hear me?

761
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:37,663
Yes, sir. I got 20-20 hearing.

762
01:17:38,163 --> 01:17:39,585
Then why didn't you answer me?

763
01:17:39,664 --> 01:17:41,758
His mother told him never
answer back to a cop.

764
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:44,052
You little wise apple!
You want me to run you in?

765
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:45,674
Indeed not, sir.

I oughta run all youse punks in.

767
01:17:48,256 --> 01:17:51,100
What are ya standin' around here
for, blockin' the sidewalks?

768
01:17:51,176 --> 01:17:55,352
You see, sir, we're afraid to go home.
It's such a bad environment.

769
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,308
- We don't get no love there.
- It's awful.

770
01:17:58,391 --> 01:18:00,644
If you don't leave us on
the streets all night...

771
01:18:00,727 --> 01:18:03,355
we liable to turn into a bunch
of juvenile delinquents.

772
01:18:03,855 --> 01:18:06,859
Listen, I know youse guys was
cookin' up somethin' at the dance.

773
01:18:06,942 --> 01:18:09,195
So don't think you'll
put nothin' over on me.

774
01:18:09,277 --> 01:18:13,532
- Sergeant, come on, quick! We got a 10-13.
- Now, go on. Get a move on, all of youse.

775
01:18:13,615 --> 01:18:16,118
And don't let me catch none
of youse around here later.

776
01:18:16,201 --> 01:18:17,999
I'll see you around.

777
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,207
You forgot to say good-bye.

778
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:24,588
Them headbusters ain't got no manners.

779
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:27,012
"And don't let me catch
none of youse here later!"

780
01:18:27,087 --> 01:18:29,966
- They treat us like we ain't even human.
- He was pretty mad.

781
01:18:30,048 --> 01:18:32,346
So, what happened?
A big fat nothin', right?

782
01:18:32,425 --> 01:18:34,302
Yeah, but suppose he comes back...

783
01:18:34,386 --> 01:18:36,354
while we are havin' the war council?

784
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:39,023
We'll snow him some more.
See, them cops...

785
01:18:39,099 --> 01:18:42,319
they believe everything they
read in the papers about us JD's.

786
01:18:42,394 --> 01:18:45,318
So that's what we give 'em,
somethin' to believe in.

787
01:18:45,397 --> 01:18:46,649
You!

788

We gotta stand up to 'em, Doc.
It's important.

You was never my age, none of ya.

- Place?
- The park?

930
01:25:58,496 --> 01:25:59,793
The river.

931
01:26:04,335 --> 01:26:05,712
Under the highway.

932
01:26:09,382 --> 01:26:12,010

933
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:14,512

01:26:50,423 --> 01:26:52,846
Afraid to slug it out?
Afraid to use plain skin?

947
01:26:53,092 --> 01:26:55,060
- Not even garbage?
- That ain't a rumble.

948
01:26:55,136 --> 01:26:56,934

- You said call weapons.

949
01:26:57,847 --> 01:27:01,852
A rumble can be clinched by a fair fight,
if you've got the guts to risk that.

950
01:27:01,934 --> 01:27:04,357
Best man from each gang to slug it out.

951
01:27:05,897 --> 01:27:08,025
I would enjoy to risk that.

952
01:27:08,483 --> 01:27:09,860
Okay. Fair fight.

953
01:27:09,942 --> 01:27:12,912

The commanders say yes or no.

954
01:27:15,448 --> 01:27:16,825
Fair fight.

955
01:27:19,118 --> 01:27:23,464
When I get through with you, you
will be like a fish after skinning.

956
01:27:23,748 --> 01:27:26,171
Your best man fights our best man.

957
01:27:26,501 --> 01:27:29,300
And we pick him.

958
01:27:30,588 --> 01:27:33,933
- But I thought I would be fighting with...
- You shook on it.

959
01:27:36,969 --> 01:27:38,687
Yes. I shook on it.

960
01:27:38,763 --> 01:27:41,186
Look, Bernardo, if you
wanna change your mind...

961
01:27:51,943 --> 01:27:53,536
Bernardo, baby, would
you like a cigarette?

962
01:27:53,611 --> 01:27:56,114
No, thank you. I don't smoke.

963
01:28:00,284 --> 01:28:02,082
Evening, Lieutenant.

964
01:28:02,328 --> 01:28:04,581
I and Tony was just closing up.

965
01:28:07,542 --> 01:28:09,965
Now, this is more like it, fellas.

966
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:12,555
Warms me all over to see you this way.

967
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:16,305
And after only a couple of words from
me at the playground. How about that?

968
01:28:16,968 --> 01:28:18,265
Do you mind?

969
01:28:18,386 --> 01:28:21,139
I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.

970
01:28:22,682 --> 01:28:26,107
You know, headquarters hears about
this, I may even get a promotion.

971
01:28:26,978 --> 01:28:29,276
Good deal all around, Bernardo?

972
01:28:30,189 --> 01:28:31,862
I get a promotion...

973
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,370
and you Puerto Ricans get what
you've been itchin' for...

974
01:28:35,778 --> 01:28:38,372
use of the playground,
use of the gym...

975
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:40,575
the streets, the candy store.

976
01:28:41,701 --> 01:28:45,501
So what if they do turn this whole
town into a stinkin' pigsty?

977
01:28:46,122 --> 01:28:49,422
Don't stop him! He wants to get
home, write letters to San Juan...

978
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,673
tell 'em how he's got
it made over here!

979
01:28:52,545 --> 01:28:56,516
What I mean is, clear out, you!
I said, clear out!

980
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:02,184
Yeah, sure, I know.

981
01:29:02,972 --> 01:29:07,227
It's a free country, and I ain't got the right.
But I got a badge.

982
01:29:08,269 --> 01:29:09,862
What do you got?

983
01:29:10,521 --> 01:29:13,365
Things are tough all over. Beat it!

984
01:29:45,598 --> 01:29:46,975
Okay, fellas...

985
01:29:48,684 --> 01:29:50,982
where's the rumble gonna be?

986
01:29:52,396 --> 01:29:53,488
Come on!

987
01:29:53,564 --> 01:29:56,113
Regular Americans don't rub
with the gold teeth unless...

988
01:29:56,192 --> 01:29:58,695
- Lieutenant...
- You shut your mouth!

989
01:30:01,572 --> 01:30:03,415
Come on, Baby John.

990
01:30:03,991 --> 01:30:07,040
Before that smooth little kisser
of yours gets out up for life.

991
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:08,746
Now, where's it gonna be?

992
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:10,456
The river?

993
01:30:11,248 --> 01:30:12,545
The park?

994
01:30:16,504 --> 01:30:18,506
Look, fellas, I'm for you.

995
01:30:18,923 --> 01:30:21,847
I want this beat cleaned up,
and you can do it for me.

996
01:30:21,926 --> 01:30:26,272
I'll even lend a hand if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumble?

997
01:30:29,433 --> 01:30:30,980
The playground?

998
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,772
Sweeney's lot?

999
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:44,366
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooligans?

1000
01:30:44,448 --> 01:30:47,543
I ought to take you to the station
and throw you in the can now!

1001
01:30:47,618 --> 01:30:50,792
You and the tinhorn immigrant
scum you come from!

1002
01:30:53,165 --> 01:30:55,588
How's your old man's DT's, A-Rab?

1003
01:30:58,212 --> 01:31:02,058
How's the action on your mother's
side of the street, Action?

1004
01:31:02,633 --> 01:31:05,227
One of these days, there won't
be anybody to hold you.

1005
01:31:05,302 --> 01:31:08,306
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!

1006
01:31:08,806 --> 01:31:11,525
Don't worry!
I'll find out where it's gonna be.

1007
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:15,650
So be sure to finish each other off,
because if you don't, I will!

1008
01:31:25,322 --> 01:31:26,824
Yeah, sure.

1009
01:31:27,241 --> 01:31:28,709
Understand them.

1010
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:32,964
That's what they keep telling me
down at headquarters. "Understand."

1011
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:37,468
You try keeping hoodlums in line,
and see what it does to you.

1012
01:31:40,671 --> 01:31:43,595
It wouldn't give me a mouth like his.

1013
01:31:47,678 --> 01:31:49,146
Come on, Doc.

1014
01:31:49,513 --> 01:31:52,187
- Don't let it get you.
- I'm sick.

1015
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:57,401
- You heard. It's gonna be a fair fight.
- And that's gonna cure somethin'?

1016
01:31:57,688 --> 01:32:00,942
From here on in, everything's
gonna be all right.

1017
01:32:01,525 --> 01:32:04,278
- Got a feelin'.
- What have you been takin' tonight?

1018
01:32:04,361 --> 01:32:07,706
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you a secret, Doc.

1019
01:32:07,907 --> 01:32:10,877
It ain't a man that's up there.
it's a girl.

1020
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:13,336
A lady.

1021
01:32:16,415 --> 01:32:19,544
- Buenas noches, señor
- Buenas noches?

1022
01:32:21,128 --> 01:32:23,472
So that's why you made it a fair fight.

1023
01:32:23,547 --> 01:32:25,549
I'm gonna see her tomorrow,
and I can't wait.

1024
01:32:25,633 --> 01:32:28,887
Tony! Things aren't tough enough?

1025
01:32:29,053 --> 01:32:31,897
- Tough? Doc, I'm in love!
- And you're not frightened?

1026
01:32:31,972 --> 01:32:33,394
Should I be?

1027
01:32:35,017 --> 01:32:36,064
No.

1028
01:32:37,144 --> 01:32:40,148
No, I'm frightened enough
for the both of you.

1029
01:35:31,402 --> 01:35:33,404
What has Chino done to her?

1030
01:35:33,654 --> 01:35:35,873
Chino? Why Chino?

1031
01:35:35,948 --> 01:35:39,919
- Maybe she's just dolling up for us.
- Gracias, querida.

1032
01:35:40,077 --> 01:35:44,799
Rosalie, Consuelo, my adorable
friends, can you keep a secret?

1033
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:46,625
I'm hot for secrets.

1034
01:35:48,544 --> 01:35:50,342
No. I won't tell you.

1035
01:35:51,088 --> 01:35:52,465
- What?
- "What?"

1036
01:35:52,548 --> 01:35:54,391
The poor girl is out of her mind.

1037
01:35:54,466 --> 01:35:55,934
I am! Crazy.

1038
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:59,104
She might be at that.
She looks somehow different.

1039
01:35:59,471 --> 01:36:02,350
- I do?
- And I think she is up to something.

1040
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:03,855
I am?

1041
01:36:04,018 --> 01:36:07,022
"I do? I am?" She talks like a parrot.

1042
01:36:07,104 --> 01:36:09,152

01:39:02,946 --> 01:39:03,947
Sure.

1110
01:39:04,031 --> 01:39:06,409
You make the bad joke home
where I can't hear it.

1111
01:39:06,491 --> 01:39:11,122
- Go now. Go home. it's closing time. Shoo!
- Buenas noches, Madam Lucia.

1112
01:39:12,956 --> 01:39:14,583
- You put down the shades?
- Yes.

1113
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,969
Turn off the lights,
and lock the doors.

1114
01:39:18,295 --> 01:39:21,094
- Buenas noches, Anita.
- Buenas noches.

1115
01:39:21,632 --> 01:39:24,977
- Adiós
- The jail is open.

1116
01:39:25,052 --> 01:39:26,770
I thought she'd never leave.

1117
01:39:26,845 --> 01:39:28,913
You know, it's hard to believe
that old bag of a witch

1118
01:39:28,914 --> 01:39:30,355
was once a young bag like us.

1119
01:39:31,099 --> 01:39:33,852
Come on, let's go before she
changes her mind and comes back.

1120
01:39:33,936 --> 01:39:36,735
You go, querida. I will lock up.

1121
01:39:37,064 --> 01:39:39,283
- Why?
- I have work.

1122
01:39:39,358 --> 01:39:40,826
Do it tomorrow.

1123
01:39:41,318 --> 01:39:43,662
- I'm in no hurry.
- I am!

1124
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:47,120
I'm going home now and take
a nice, long bubble bath.

1125
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:50,828
- Black orchid.
- Black orchid?

1126
01:39:51,578 --> 01:39:52,955
All over.

1127
01:39:53,372 --> 01:39:55,670
I gotta date with Nardo
after the rumble.

1128
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:57,668
What rumble?

1129
01:39:58,919 --> 01:40:00,519
Oh...well, uh...

1130
01:40:00,545 --> 01:40:03,219
Nardo's Sharks and those
boys at the dance.

1131
01:40:03,465 --> 01:40:05,684
They fight each other tonight?

1132
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:07,552
They don't play patsy.

1133
01:40:10,305 --> 01:40:12,353
Why must they always fight?

1134
01:40:12,432 --> 01:40:16,312
You saw how they dance, like they
gotta get rid of something quick.

1135
01:40:16,395 --> 01:40:18,272
That's how they fight.

1136
01:40:18,605 --> 01:40:20,357
To get rid of what?

1137
01:40:20,816 --> 01:40:24,320
Too much feeling.
And they do get rid of it.

1138
01:40:24,569 --> 01:40:28,119
Boy, after a fight, that brother
of yours is so healthy.

1139
01:40:28,865 --> 01:40:31,118
Definitely black orchid.

1140
01:40:42,796 --> 01:40:44,298
Buenas noches.

1141
01:40:45,549 --> 01:40:48,678
"You go, querida. I will lock up."

1142
01:40:51,847 --> 01:40:53,394
It's too early for noches.

1143
01:40:53,598 --> 01:40:55,100
Buenas tardes.

1144
01:40:55,851 --> 01:40:57,228
Gracias...

1145
01:40:58,854 --> 01:40:59,855
buenas tardes.

1146
01:40:59,938 --> 01:41:03,033
He just came from the
drugstore to deliver aspirin.

1147
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:04,493
You'll need it.

1148
01:41:04,568 --> 01:41:07,196
Not us. We're fine.

1149
01:41:07,738 --> 01:41:10,958
- We're out of the world.
- You're out of your heads.

1150
01:41:11,408 --> 01:41:14,582
- We're 12 feet in the air.
- Anita can see that.

1151
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:21,381
You will not tell?

1152
01:41:24,963 --> 01:41:26,135
Tell what?

1153
01:41:26,214 --> 01:41:29,058
How can I know what goes
on 12 feet over my head?

1154
01:41:31,303 --> 01:41:34,056
You better be home in 15 minutes.

1155
01:41:43,023 --> 01:41:45,321
It's all right. She likes us.

1156
01:41:46,193 --> 01:41:49,788
- But she is worried, and so am I.
- That's foolish.

1157
01:41:49,905 --> 01:41:51,623
Are you going to that rumble tonight?

1158
01:41:51,698 --> 01:41:53,496
- No.
- Yes!

1159
01:41:54,117 --> 01:41:56,495
- Why?
- You must go and stop it.

1160
01:41:56,578 --> 01:42:00,299
I have stopped it. It'll only be a
fistfight between two of 'em. Nardo...

1161
01:42:00,374 --> 01:42:02,502
Any fight is no good for us.

1162
01:42:02,793 --> 01:42:06,798
- Everything is good for us. We got magic.
- Listen and hear me.

1163
01:42:07,672 --> 01:42:09,345
You must go and stop it.

1164
01:42:10,842 --> 01:42:12,594
It means that much to you?

1165
01:42:12,677 --> 01:42:13,769
Yes.

1166
01:42:14,721 --> 01:42:16,394
All right, I will, then.

1167
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:18,642
I believe you.

1168
01:42:19,101 --> 01:42:21,604
- You do have magic.
- Of course.

1169
01:42:23,105 --> 01:42:24,573
I've got you.

1170
01:42:25,607 --> 01:42:28,827
And tonight, after I stop the
rumble that isn't a rumble...

1171
01:42:28,902 --> 01:42:29,949
I'll come by for you.

1172
01:42:30,028 --> 01:42:32,827
- I will wait for you on the roof.
- No.

1173
01:42:33,657 --> 01:42:34,954
Not the roof.

1174
01:42:35,409 --> 01:42:36,911
I'll come to your house.

1175
01:42:37,327 --> 01:42:39,580
You cannot. My mama.

1176
01:42:41,915 --> 01:42:44,668
- Then I'll take you to my house.
- Your mama?

1177
01:42:47,462 --> 01:42:49,885
She'll come runnin' from the
kitchen to welcome you.

1178
01:42:49,965 --> 01:42:52,969
- She lives in the kitchen.
- Dressed so elegant?

1179
01:42:53,051 --> 01:42:56,726
I told her you were coming.
She'll look at your face. Try not to smile.

1180
01:42:56,805 --> 01:43:00,435
She'll say, "Skinny, but pretty."

1181
01:43:01,726 --> 01:43:03,603
She is plump, no doubt?

1182
01:43:04,354 --> 01:43:05,355
Fat.

1183
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:08,738
I take after my mama. Delicate-boned.

1184
01:43:12,279 --> 01:43:14,077
Not in front of Mama!

1185
01:43:15,907 --> 01:43:18,831
I would like to see Papa in this.

1186
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:20,753
Mama will make him ask
about your prospects.

1187
01:43:20,829 --> 01:43:21,921
Many.

1188
01:43:21,997 --> 01:43:24,591
- If you go to church.
- Always.

1189
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:28,924
Yes, Papa might like you.

1190
01:43:31,339 --> 01:43:34,764
- May I have your daughter's hand?
- He says, "Yes."

1191
01:43:35,886 --> 01:43:37,138
Gracias.

1192
01:43:37,888 --> 01:43:40,937
- And your mama?
- I'm afraid to ask her.

1193
01:43:41,057 --> 01:43:45,187
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.

1194
01:43:47,814 --> 01:43:49,157
She says, "Yes!"

1195
01:43:49,232 --> 01:43:51,030
She has good taste.

1196
01:43:52,068 --> 01:43:54,162
Here. Maid of honor.

1197
01:43:54,404 --> 01:43:58,034
- That color is bad for Anita.
- The best man!

1198
01:43:58,116 --> 01:43:59,743
That is my papa!

1199
01:44:01,244 --> 01:44:02,746
Sorry, Papa.

1200
01:44:04,789 --> 01:44:07,417
Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb.

1201
01:44:07,918 --> 01:44:11,548
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.

1202
01:44:14,758 --> 01:44:17,136
Look! Mama's crying already.

1203
01:44:51,044 --> 01:44:52,466
I, Anton...

1204
01:44:52,796 --> 01:44:54,719
take thee, Maria...

1205
01:44:54,798 --> 01:44:57,847
I, Maria, take thee, Anton...

1206
01:44:58,677 --> 01:45:01,146
For richer, for poorer...

1207
01:45:01,346 --> 01:45:03,815
In sickness and in health...

1208
01:45:04,808 --> 01:45:07,482
To love and to honor...

1209
01:45:08,186 --> 01:45:10,405
To hold and to keep...

1210
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:14,443
From each sun to each moon...

1211
01:45:15,485 --> 01:45:17,908
From tomorrow to tomorrow...

1212
01:45:20,115 --> 01:45:21,992
From now to forever...

1213
01:45:23,577 --> 01:45:25,454
Till death do us part.

1214
01:45:30,333 --> 01:45:33,337
With this ring, I thee wed.

1215
01:45:36,047 --> 01:45:38,049
With this ring...

1216
01:45:38,883 --> 01:45:40,726
I thee wed.

Ready.

1289
01:52:08,022 --> 01:52:11,196
- Now, move in and shake hands.
- For what?

1290
01:52:13,861 --> 01:52:15,738
That's the way it's done, buddy boy.

1291
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:18,408
More gracious living?

1292
01:52:18,825 --> 01:52:22,045
Look, every one of you hates every
one of us, and we hate you back.

1293
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:23,337
Let's get at it.

1294
01:52:23,413 --> 01:52:25,336
- Sure.
- Here we go.

1295
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,514
- Let's get in there...
- Come on, Ice.

1296
01:52:36,592 --> 01:52:38,265
Come on, Ice, come on!

1297
01:52:41,431 --> 01:52:43,274
Keep your eyes open!

1298
01:52:44,642 --> 01:52:46,064
Hold it!

1299
01:52:48,104 --> 01:52:51,779
Tony! Get with the gang. It's all okay.

1300
01:52:51,858 --> 01:52:52,950
No!

1301
01:52:53,317 --> 01:52:54,409
Tony, what are you doing?

1302
01:52:54,485 --> 01:52:57,159
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battles.

1303
01:52:58,698 --> 01:53:03,078
It don't take guts if you got a battle.
We ain't got one. None of us.

1304
01:53:03,786 --> 01:53:05,459
- Okay, Nardo?
- Tony!

1305
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,134
Hold it! Now, let's just cool it.

1306
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:11,799
The deal is, a fair fight
between you and Ice.

1307
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:15,595
- Come on, get with the gang.
- Mother hen protecting the little one?

1308
01:53:15,673 --> 01:53:18,142
- I'll give you a battle.
- You've got one!

1309
01:53:18,217 --> 01:53:20,561
I'll take pretty boy as a warm-up.

1310
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:23,939
Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, gutless?

1311
01:53:24,432 --> 01:53:25,854
- Afraid, chicken?
- Cut it!

1312
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,147
No!

1313
01:53:29,187 --> 01:53:31,656
- I don't wanna, Bernardo.
- I'm sure.

1314
01:53:31,731 --> 01:53:33,449
- Now, listen to me.
- Are you chicken?

1315
01:53:33,524 --> 01:53:35,743
- There's no need to fight.
- The hell there ain't!

1316
01:53:35,818 --> 01:53:37,820
- You've got it wrong!
- Chicken!

1317
01:53:39,238 --> 01:53:41,832
- Why can't you understand?
- Understand, chicken!

1318
01:53:42,241 --> 01:53:44,414
- Get out of here!
- Kill him, Tony!

1319
01:53:44,494 --> 01:53:45,746
Come on!

1320
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:48,965
- Afraid to fight?
- Come on.

1321
01:53:49,499 --> 01:53:52,343
- Let me see you fight.
- Chicken boy!

1322
01:53:53,795 --> 01:53:55,513
He is chicken!

1323
01:55:57,214 --> 01:55:59,342
Pretty boy. Listen to him!

1324
01:55:59,549 --> 01:56:02,678
Don't! Stop it!
We got nothin' to fight about.

1325
01:56:03,261 --> 01:56:05,889
- Bernardo!
- Yellow-bellied chicken!

1326
01:56:05,972 --> 01:56:09,317
- Don't push me!
- Come on, you yellow-bellied Polack!

1327
01:56:23,031 --> 01:56:26,285
- Riff! What are you doin'?
- Get outta here, Tony!

1328
01:56:26,535 --> 01:56:29,209
- Riff, don't!
- Hold him!

1329
01:56:30,539 --> 01:56:31,882
Let me go!

1330
01:56:42,217 --> 01:56:43,389
Riff, don't!

1331
01:56:55,730 --> 01:56:57,403
Keep outta this!

1332
01:56:58,817 --> 01:57:00,490
Somebody stop him!

1333
01:57:00,986 --> 01:57:02,329
Let me go!

1334
01:57:03,238 --> 01:57:04,330
Ice!

1335
01:57:04,573 --> 01:57:05,745
Tiger!

1336
01:57:31,933 --> 01:57:33,059
Riff!

1337
01:57:39,191 --> 01:57:41,114
- Come on, Nardo!
- Stop him!

1338
01:57:43,904 --> 01:57:45,372
Riff, don't!

1339
01:58:16,061 --> 01:58:17,153
Get them!

1340
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,492
Maria!

1341
01:59:59,414 --> 02:00:01,758
Tony, come on! Come on, Tony!

1342
02:00:01,958 --> 02:00:03,801
We gotta get out of here! Come on!

1343
02:00:07,255 --> 02:00:09,758
Come on, Tony! Come on!

1344
02:00:09,883 --> 02:00:11,305
Get outta here!

1345
02:00:23,271 --> 02:00:24,523
Come on!

1346
02:00:30,862 --> 02:00:32,409
Come on, Tony!

1347
02:00:56,071 --> 02:01:00,071
Inserted comments without subtitles
(about 3 minutes)

1348
02:02:49,097 --> 02:02:50,770
Wait for me, Rosa.

1349
02:03:58,291 --> 02:03:59,463
Chino!

1350
02:04:00,377 --> 02:04:02,550
There was no one downstairs.

1351
02:04:03,088 --> 02:04:06,638
My mother and father are at the store.
I didn't expect you to come by.

1352
02:04:06,716 --> 02:04:08,514
- I would have waited down...
- Maria.

1353
02:04:09,010 --> 02:04:12,059
- You have been fighting, Chino?
- Yes.

1354
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:15,392
- I am sorry.
- That is not like you.

1355
02:04:15,892 --> 02:04:18,270
- No.
- You must go home and wash up.

1356
02:04:18,895 --> 02:04:21,648
- I will see you tomorrow.
- Maria, at the rumble...

1357
02:04:21,731 --> 02:04:23,825
- There was no rumble.
- There was.

1358
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:25,493
- No. You are wrong.
- There was.

1359
02:04:25,568 --> 02:04:27,696
Nobody meant for it to happen.

1360
02:04:33,493 --> 02:04:34,585
Tell me.

1361
02:04:36,246 --> 02:04:37,589
It is bad.

1362
02:04:38,748 --> 02:04:40,170
Very bad?

1363
02:04:42,377 --> 02:04:43,720
You see...

1364
02:04:47,298 --> 02:04:50,097
It will be easier if
you say it very fast.

1365
02:04:51,261 --> 02:04:52,934
There was a fight.

1366
02:04:54,305 --> 02:04:55,727
And Nardo...

1367
02:04:56,433 --> 02:04:58,106
Somehow a knife...

1368
02:04:59,227 --> 02:05:01,821
- And Nardo and someone, they...
- Tony.

1369
02:05:03,398 --> 02:05:05,275
What happened to Tony?

1370
02:05:06,317 --> 02:05:09,446
Chino, tell me! Is Tony all right?

1371
02:05:12,615 --> 02:05:14,492
He killed your brother!

1372
02:05:22,083 --> 02:05:23,585
You are lying.

1373
02:05:24,502 --> 02:05:26,721
Chino, why do you lie to me?

1374
02:05:31,301 --> 02:05:33,770
Chino, true, you are lying! Why?

1375
02:05:33,845 --> 02:05:35,768
Why do you lie to me, Chino?

1376
02:05:36,931 --> 02:05:38,433
Mama! Mama!

1377
02:05:38,683 --> 02:05:42,233
- Bernardo está muerto!
- Bernardo, muerto?

1378
02:05:42,312 --> 02:05:43,484
No!

1379
02:05:50,653 --> 02:05:55,329
Santa María, make it not be true.
Please make it not be true.

1380
02:05:55,533 --> 02:05:59,754
Madre de Dios, I will do anything.
Make me die!

1381
02:05:59,829 --> 02:06:02,173
Only, please, make it not be true.

1382
02:06:06,544 --> 02:06:08,171
Make it not be...

1383
02:06:12,842 --> 02:06:14,094
Killer!

1384
02:06:22,018 --> 02:06:23,816
I tried to stop it.

1385
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:26,857
I did try.

1386
02:06:27,065 --> 02:06:31,070
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't wanna.

1387
02:06:31,194 --> 02:06:33,162
But Riff's like my brother...

1388
02:06:33,238 --> 02:06:37,038
when Bernardo killed him,
Bernardo didn't mean it either.

1389
02:06:40,703 --> 02:06:42,421
I thought you knew.

1390
02:06:46,918 --> 02:06:49,262
I didn't come to tell you that.

1391
02:06:49,712 --> 02:06:52,807
Just for you to forgive me,
so I can go to the police.

1392
02:06:52,882 --> 02:06:54,884
- No!
- It'll be easy now.

1393
02:06:54,968 --> 02:06:56,515
- I won't let you!
- I must.

1394
02:06:56,594 --> 02:06:59,598
- Stay! Stay with me.
- Maria, I love you so much!

1395
02:06:59,681 --> 02:07:01,149
Don't leave me!

1396
02:07:01,224 --> 02:07:02,771
Whatever you want, I'll do.

1397
02:07:02,851 --> 02:07:05,525
- Hold me!
- Forever!

1398
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:06,987
Tighten

1399
02:07:07,313 --> 02:07:11,113
it'll be all right. I know it.
We're really together now.

1400
02:07:12,193 --> 02:07:13,786
But it's not us.

1401
02:07:15,572 --> 02:07:17,574
It's everything around us.

1402
02:07:18,908 --> 02:07:22,378
Then I'll take you away,
where nothing can get to us.

1403
02:07:24,038 --> 02:07:26,416
Not anyone or anything.

Baby John, what are you doin' here?

1432
02:10:13,249 --> 02:10:14,546
Nothin'.

1433
02:10:15,001 --> 02:10:17,595
What are you doin' nothin' here for?
Come on.

1434
02:10:18,671 --> 02:10:21,299
I don't want the guys to see me, A-Rab.

1435
02:10:21,758 --> 02:10:23,010
Why not?

1436
02:10:23,885 --> 02:10:25,512
I'm cryin'.

1437
02:10:26,804 --> 02:10:28,056
You are?

1438
02:10:30,058 --> 02:10:31,310
What for?

1439
02:10:32,018 --> 02:10:34,817
- I don't know. I'm just...
- Blow your nose.

1440
02:10:41,235 --> 02:10:42,407
A-Rab?

1441
02:10:42,612 --> 02:10:43,704
Yeah?

1442
02:10:44,197 --> 02:10:46,666
Did you get a look at their faces?

1443
02:10:48,451 --> 02:10:50,499
- Which faces?
- You know...

1444
02:10:51,412 --> 02:10:53,790
At the rumble. Riff and Bernardo.

1445
02:10:55,083 --> 02:10:56,175
Yeah.

1446
02:10:59,837 --> 02:11:03,887
- I wish it was yesterday.
- Me, too. I'm scared.

1447
02:11:03,966 --> 02:11:07,345
- Cut it out. You hear me? Cut it out!
- A-Rab, what are we gonna do?

1448
02:11:07,428 --> 02:11:10,307
We'll meet the other guys and form up.
That's what we'll do.

1449
02:11:10,390 --> 02:11:12,313
Now, come on. Let's go.

1450
02:11:13,267 --> 02:11:15,110
You got a handkerchief first?

1451
02:11:15,186 --> 02:11:16,859
What's wrong with your sleeve?

1452
02:11:45,216 --> 02:11:48,311
- Where you been?
- Where do you think, the Stork Club?

1453
02:11:48,386 --> 02:11:50,388
- We thought they nabbed you.
- Go on.

1454
02:11:50,471 --> 02:11:53,190
- You didn't see Tony?
- Nothin' but coppers.

1455
02:11:53,516 --> 02:11:54,768
What's wrong with him?

1456
02:11:54,851 --> 02:11:57,024
There's nothin' wrong.
He's okay, you get it?

1457
02:11:57,103 --> 02:11:58,605
All right, all right!

1458
02:11:58,688 --> 02:12:00,861
- Maybe we oughta go home.
- For what?

1459
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:02,863
- Betcha they got him.
- Not Tony.

1460
02:12:02,942 --> 02:12:06,537
- Man, he was great, right, Baby John?
- Yeah.

1461
02:12:06,863 --> 02:12:10,868
- He really come through for the Jets.
- Just like Riff said he...

1462
02:12:13,453 --> 02:12:14,955
Said he would.

1463
02:12:19,709 --> 02:12:21,552
I want Riff!

1464
02:12:23,129 --> 02:12:24,881
Come on, Graziella.

1465
02:12:27,091 --> 02:12:29,594
Nobody was supposed to get killed.

1466
02:12:30,761 --> 02:12:32,104
It just...

1467
02:12:37,810 --> 02:12:39,278
They're gonna pay!

1468
02:12:39,353 --> 02:12:41,572
- Them stinkin' Sharks.
- Dirty fighting.

1469
02:12:41,647 --> 02:12:42,648
They started it!

1470
02:12:42,732 --> 02:12:45,485
So why don't we finish it?
We gotta show 'em who's on top.

1471
02:12:45,568 --> 02:12:48,538
- The Jets! Let's do it now!
- Ain't we had enough?

1472
02:12:48,613 --> 02:12:51,833
- What's the matter, you scared?
- Who you callin' scared?

1473
02:12:51,908 --> 02:12:53,660
- Lay off of him.
- Mind your own business.

1474
02:12:53,743 --> 02:12:55,086
Don't sound off on me. I'll...

1475
02:12:55,161 --> 02:12:57,710
- You'll do what?
- Knock it off!

1476
02:13:00,458 --> 02:13:03,086
Shut up down there, you dirty
bunch of good-for-nothings!

1477
02:13:03,169 --> 02:13:04,591
Go home where you belong!

1478
02:13:04,670 --> 02:13:07,389
Who you callin' good-for-nothin',
you loudmouth crud head?

1479
02:13:07,465 --> 02:13:09,513
Come down, I'll put
this through your face!

1480
02:13:09,592 --> 02:13:12,186
- Get inside! All of you!
- Come on!

1481
02:13:17,767 --> 02:13:20,361
- Shut up!
- I don't have to take that from nobody!

1482
02:13:20,436 --> 02:13:23,360
Next creep who sounds on me,
I swear the next guy...

1483
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:24,941
You'll laugh!

1484
02:13:30,613 --> 02:13:31,739
Yeah.

1485
02:13:32,782 --> 02:13:35,786
Now, you all better dig
this and dig it good!

1486
02:13:36,244 --> 02:13:38,918
No matter who or what is eatin' you...

1487
02:13:38,996 --> 02:13:41,670
man, you show it, and you are dead!

1488
02:13:44,794 --> 02:13:49,220
You are cuttin' a hole in yourselves for
them to stick in a red-hot umbrella...

1489
02:13:49,298 --> 02:13:51,016
and open it wide!

1490
02:13:52,093 --> 02:13:56,348
Man, you wanna get past the cops when
they start askin' about tonight?

1491
02:13:56,722 --> 02:13:58,190
You play it cool.

1492
02:16:57,433 --> 02:16:59,936
You wanna live in this lousy world?

1493
02:17:00,561 --> 02:17:02,029
Play it cool.

1494
02:17:02,938 --> 02:17:04,440
- I wanna get even!
- Get cool!

1495

- Bust cool!

Let's go.

1532
02:21:57,149 --> 02:21:58,366
Where we goin'?

1533
02:21:58,442 --> 02:22:00,740
If we lay low, the coppers
are gonna smell fish.

1534
02:22:00,819 --> 02:22:03,197
- So the first thing we do...
- Buddy boy!

1535
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:06,705
- Go wear a skirt.
- I got scabby knees. Listen...

1536
02:22:06,784 --> 02:22:09,537
First, start showing around
like we got nothin' to hide.

1537
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:11,338
Suppose they ask us about the rumble.

1538
02:22:11,413 --> 02:22:15,543
Supposin' they ask you where's Tony and
what party's lookin' for him with a gun!

1539
02:22:15,626 --> 02:22:17,299
You know somethin'?

1540
02:22:17,461 --> 02:22:20,510
- I know I gotta go get a skirt.
- Come on, Anybodys!

1541
02:22:20,589 --> 02:22:22,557
- What's the freak know?
- Plenty!

1542
02:22:22,674 --> 02:22:25,223
I figured somebody oughta
infiltrate PR territory...

1543
02:22:25,302 --> 02:22:26,428
and spy around.

1544
02:22:26,512 --> 02:22:28,606
I'm very large with shadows, you know.

1545
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:31,274
I can slip in and out of 'em
like wind through a fence.

1546
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:34,775
- Boy, is she ever makin' the most of it.
- You bet your fat "A," I am!

1547
02:22:34,853 --> 02:22:36,480
- Spill it!
- Okay.

1548
02:22:36,563 --> 02:22:40,659
I hear Chino tellin' the Sharks somethin'
about Tony and Bernardo's sister.

1549
02:22:40,734 --> 02:22:42,236
And then I hear Chino say,

1550
02:22:42,319 --> 02:22:45,163
"If it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna get that Polack."

1551
02:22:45,239 --> 02:22:47,742
And then he pulls out the bad news!

1552
02:22:48,367 --> 02:22:50,665
- Them PR's won't stop.
- Till we stop 'em.

1553
02:22:50,744 --> 02:22:51,836
Hold it!

1554
02:22:52,287 --> 02:22:53,504
Now, listen...

1555
02:22:53,914 --> 02:22:57,168
Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.

1556
02:22:57,376 --> 02:23:00,050
- We gotta find him before Chino finds him.
- And burns him.

1557
02:23:00,129 --> 02:23:02,302
You cover the river!
Snowboy, get over to Doc's.

1558
02:23:02,381 --> 02:23:05,100
- I'll take the alleys.
- We'll take the streets.

1559
02:23:05,175 --> 02:23:06,347
- The park.
- The schoolyard.

1560
02:23:06,427 --> 02:23:07,770
We'll take the playground.

1561
02:23:07,845 --> 02:23:09,188
What about me?

1562
02:23:10,597 --> 02:23:13,191
You? In and out of the shadows.

1563
02:23:13,434 --> 02:23:16,313
- Maybe you'll find Tony in one of them.
- Right!

1564
02:23:19,815 --> 02:23:21,783
You done good, buddy boy.

1565
02:23:22,693 --> 02:23:25,492
Thanks, daddy-o.

1566
02:24:28,717 --> 02:24:29,934
Who is...

1567
02:24:33,305 --> 02:24:34,477
Maria.

1568
02:24:40,187 --> 02:24:42,406
Maria, it's Anita. You in there?

1569
02:24:43,482 --> 02:24:45,325
- Maria?
- Yes.

1570
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:47,402
Open the door. I need you.

1571
02:24:49,196 --> 02:24:50,197
No.

1572
02:24:55,786 --> 02:24:58,756
- Now you are afraid, too?
- What?

1573
02:24:58,830 --> 02:25:00,582
I'll be right there.

1574
02:25:06,713 --> 02:25:08,886
- Together.
- But where?

1575
02:25:09,967 --> 02:25:12,891
The bus station. We'll go so far
away, they'll never find us.

1576
02:25:12,970 --> 02:25:15,894
- How can we?
- Doc will help us. I'll get money from him.

1577
02:25:15,973 --> 02:25:18,226
- You'll meet me at his store.
- At Doc's, yes.

1578
02:25:18,308 --> 02:25:20,402
- I'll wait for you there.
- All right.

1579
02:25:20,769 --> 02:25:21,895

1585
02:26:00,892 --> 02:26:02,894

Chino has a gun.

1648
02:30:09,599 --> 02:30:11,567
I heard the boys talking.

1649
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:15,610
- He's hunting for Tony.
- He is at Doc's store, waiting for me.

1650
02:30:16,189 --> 02:30:19,614
If Chino hurts him, if he touches
him, I swear to you, I'll...

1651
02:30:19,693 --> 02:30:23,664
- You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo.
- I love Tony.

1652
02:30:24,281 --> 02:30:25,453
I know.

1653
02:30:26,533 --> 02:30:28,080
I loved Bernardo.

1654
02:30:36,334 --> 02:30:38,336
- Anybody home?
- Yes.

1655
02:30:40,297 --> 02:30:43,972
- Bernardo's sister, please.
- She isn't feeling well.

1656
02:30:44,509 --> 02:30:45,726
Who is?

1657
02:30:48,430 --> 02:30:49,807
Hello, miss.

1658
02:30:50,432 --> 02:30:53,606
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't like to
disturb you at a time like this...

1659
02:30:53,685 --> 02:30:57,064
Yes, a very bad time.
You'll excuse me, please.

1660
02:30:57,147 --> 02:31:00,401
- I have a couple of questions to ask.
- Afterwards, please.

1661
02:31:00,734 --> 02:31:03,157
- I must go to my brother now.
- Now, just one minute!

1662
02:31:03,236 --> 02:31:05,159
- Can't you wait?
- No!

1663
02:31:07,157 --> 02:31:08,329
Now.

1664
02:31:08,491 --> 02:31:09,993
You were at the dance at
the gym last night...

1665
02:31:10,076 --> 02:31:11,901
Will this take very long?

1666
02:31:11,902 --> 02:31:13,580
As long as it has to.

1667
02:31:14,998 --> 02:31:16,341
Excuse me.

1668
02:31:17,667 --> 02:31:20,090
Anita, my headache is much worse.

1669
02:31:20,170 --> 02:31:22,019
Will you go to Doc's store for me?

1670
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,925
Don't you people keep aspirin around?

1671
02:31:24,007 --> 02:31:26,055
This is something special.

1672
02:31:27,886 --> 02:31:29,888
Will you go for me, Anita?

1673
02:31:35,810 --> 02:31:37,562
What shall I ask for?

1674
02:31:38,688 --> 02:31:40,190
Doc will know.

1675
02:31:40,857 --> 02:31:45,408
Tell him I have been detained and
can't get there right away...

1676
02:31:46,029 --> 02:31:48,748
or I would have picked it up myself.

1677
02:31:59,209 --> 02:32:01,587
Excuse me. You were asking?

1678
02:32:03,630 --> 02:32:04,722
Yeah.

1679
02:32:05,465 --> 02:32:08,639
At the gym last night, your brother
got into a heavy argument...

1680
02:32:08,718 --> 02:32:11,562
because you danced with the wrong boy.

1681
02:32:13,390 --> 02:32:16,269
- Yes.
- Who was the boy?

1682
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:19,528
Another from my country.

1683
02:32:20,438 --> 02:32:21,906
And his name?

1684
02:32:22,774 --> 02:32:24,100
José.

1685
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:36,834
- Can't find him. He ain't nowhere.
- He's right down there in the cellar.

1686
02:32:36,913 --> 02:32:38,039
- Tony?
- Safe and sound.

1687
02:32:38,123 --> 02:32:40,501
- I found him.
- You warn him about Chino?

1688
02:32:40,583 --> 02:32:43,928
- What's he doin' in the cellar?
- Keepin' the mice company, stupid.

1689
02:32:44,212 --> 02:32:46,556
- No sign of Chino?
- Nothin'.

1690
02:32:46,631 --> 02:32:47,723
His luck.

1691
02:32:47,799 --> 02:32:49,927
I'll slip out the back and
check the alleys again.

1692
02:32:50,010 --> 02:32:52,183
- You guys hang here.
- Right.

1693
02:32:52,262 --> 02:32:56,563
- Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?
- Upstairs raising getaway money for Tony.

1694
02:32:56,641 --> 02:32:59,064
- Doc ain't got no money.
- His mattress has.

1695
02:32:59,144 --> 02:33:02,023
Come on. Cut the frabberjabber.
Grab some readin' matter.

1696
02:33:02,105 --> 02:33:03,948
Play the juke. Some of you get outside.

1697
02:33:04,024 --> 02:33:06,743
If you see Chino or those
stinkin' PR's comin...

1698
02:33:18,246 --> 02:33:20,795
- I'd like to see Doc.
- He ain't here.

1699
02:33:21,958 --> 02:33:24,302
- Where is he?
- He went to the bank.

1700
02:33:24,377 --> 02:33:26,129
They made a mistake in his favor.

1701
02:33:26,337 --> 02:33:29,011
The banks are closed at night.
Where is he?

1702
02:33:29,090 --> 02:33:30,683
You know how skinny Doc is.

1703
02:33:30,759 --> 02:33:32,761
He slipped in through
the night-deposit slot.

1704
02:33:32,844 --> 02:33:35,267
And got stuck halfway in.

1705
02:33:35,346 --> 02:33:38,850
Which indicates there's no
tellin' when he'll be back.

1706
02:33:40,935 --> 02:33:43,404
Buenas noches, señorita.

1707
02:33:52,864 --> 02:33:54,616
Where you goin'?

1708
02:33:54,824 --> 02:33:58,328
- Downstairs.
- Didn't I tell you he ain't here?

1709
02:33:59,162 --> 02:34:01,290
I'd like to see for myself.

1710
02:34:03,792 --> 02:34:05,294
Please.

1711
02:34:08,463 --> 02:34:09,680
Please.

1712
02:34:12,342 --> 02:34:13,685
Por favor.

1713
02:34:14,344 --> 02:34:17,689
- Will you let me pass?
- She's too dark to pass.

1714
02:34:17,764 --> 02:34:19,437
- Don't
- Please don't.

1715
02:34:19,516 --> 02:34:21,109
- Por favor.
- No comprende.

1716
02:34:21,184 --> 02:34:22,481
- Gracias.
- De nada.

1717
02:34:22,560 --> 02:34:23,607
Mambo!

1718
02:34:23,686 --> 02:34:25,563
- Listen, you!
- We're listenin'.

1719
02:34:25,647 --> 02:34:28,776
Look, I gotta give a
friend of yours a message.

1720
02:34:28,858 --> 02:34:30,405
- I gotta tell Tony...
- He ain't here.

1721
02:34:30,485 --> 02:34:32,237
- I know he is.
- Who says he is?

1722
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,913
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.

1723
02:34:33,988 --> 02:34:35,831
Couldn't be from Chino, could it?

1724
02:34:35,907 --> 02:34:39,127
Don't you understand? I want to help!

1725
02:34:39,202 --> 02:34:42,957
- Bernardo's girl wants to help?
- Even a greaseball's got feelings.

1726
02:34:43,039 --> 02:34:45,041
- But she wants to help get Tony.
- No!

1727
02:34:45,125 --> 02:34:48,800
- Not much. Bernardo's tramp.
- Bernardo's pig!

1728
02:34:49,045 --> 02:34:50,843
- You lyin' Spic!
- Don't do that.

1729
02:34:50,922 --> 02:34:52,720
- Gold tooth!
- Pierced ear!

1730
02:34:53,133 --> 02:34:54,680
- Don't.
- Garlic mouth.

1731
02:34:56,845 --> 02:34:59,268
- I want to help!
- Come on!

1732
02:34:59,556 --> 02:35:01,775
- Go!
- Chiquita!

1733
02:35:02,892 --> 02:35:03,893
No!

1734
02:35:06,229 --> 02:35:07,822
Olé! Olé!

1735
02:35:08,231 --> 02:35:09,403
Hey, babe!

1736
02:35:10,066 --> 02:35:11,238
Come on!

1737
02:35:15,572 --> 02:35:16,664
Let's get her!

1738
02:35:16,739 --> 02:35:19,538
- No, you don't.
- Come on, baby.

1739
02:35:28,877 --> 02:35:29,969
Come on!

1740
02:35:30,295 --> 02:35:31,547
Stop it!

1741
02:35:36,467 --> 02:35:38,469
What are you doing there?

1742
02:35:58,031 --> 02:35:59,874
Bernardo was right.

1743
02:36:01,993 --> 02:36:03,461
If one of you...

1744
02:36:03,578 --> 02:36:07,048
was lying in the street bleeding...

1745
02:36:07,290 --> 02:36:09,964
l'd walk by and spit on you!

1746
02:36:10,126 --> 02:36:12,345
She'll tell Chino that
Tony's in the cellar.

1747
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:14,297
Don't you touch me!

1748
02:36:17,467 --> 02:36:20,437
I got a message for
your American buddy.

1749
02:36:21,471 --> 02:36:25,192
You tell that murderer that
Maria's never going to meet him!

1750
02:36:26,142 --> 02:36:29,737
You tell him that Chino
found out about them...

1751
02:36:30,063 --> 02:36:31,656
and shot her!

1752
02:36:32,857 --> 02:36:34,234
She's dead!

1753
02:36:38,821 --> 02:36:40,915
When do you kids stop?

1754
02:36:42,033 --> 02:36:44,877
You make this world lousy!

1755
02:36:45,662 --> 02:36:47,539
We didn't make it, Doc.

1756
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:51,167
Get outta here!

1757
02:37:21,698 --> 02:37:22,870
Maria?

1758
02:37:23,825 --> 02:37:26,248
Doc, I thought I heard... You got it!

1759
02:37:26,327 --> 02:37:29,922
- Yes, I got it.
- Doc, you're a pal.

1760
02:37:29,998 --> 02:37:32,092
You're the best friend a guy ever had.

1761
02:37:32,166 --> 02:37:34,715
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I promise.

1762
02:37:34,836 --> 02:37:37,589
- Forget that.
- No, I'll never! I couldn't.

1763
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:41,180
Doc, you know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?

1764
02:37:41,259 --> 02:37:43,887
We'll have kids, and we'll
name 'em all after you...

1765
02:37:43,970 --> 02:37:45,972
even the girls, so when you visit us...

1766
02:37:46,055 --> 02:37:47,398
Wake up!

1767
02:37:48,391 --> 02:37:51,395
Is this the only way to
get through to you...

1768
02:37:51,936 --> 02:37:56,316
do just what you all do,
bust like a hot water pipe?

1769
02:37:56,524 --> 02:37:57,821
What's got into you?

1770
02:37:57,900 --> 02:38:01,279
Why do you kids live
like there's a war on?

1771
02:38:05,825 --> 02:38:07,543
Why do you kill?

1772
02:38:11,748 --> 02:38:13,876
I told you how it happened.

1773
02:38:14,751 --> 02:38:16,424
Maria understands.

1774
02:38:17,295 --> 02:38:21,425
- I thought you did, too.
- Maria understands nothing...

1775
02:38:22,342 --> 02:38:23,764
Never again.

1776
02:38:24,135 --> 02:38:26,388
There is no Maria, Tony.

1777
02:38:30,433 --> 02:38:31,525
What?

1778
02:38:33,227 --> 02:38:35,321
- I can't.
- No, no, Doc.

1779
02:38:36,064 --> 02:38:38,362
Now, tell me. What is it?

1780
02:38:39,442 --> 02:38:41,410
That was Anita upstairs.

1781
02:38:42,570 --> 02:38:45,619
Chino found out about you and Maria...

1782
02:38:46,824 --> 02:38:48,826
and he killed her.

1783
02:38:56,459 --> 02:38:57,460
No.

1784
02:39:02,965 --> 02:39:04,137
Maria.

1785
02:39:12,183 --> 02:39:13,730
Not Maria, Doc.

1786
02:39:15,186 --> 02:39:16,438
She's...

1787
02:39:23,403 --> 02:39:24,575
Chino!

1788
02:39:28,533 --> 02:39:30,661
Come and get me, too, Chino!

1789
02:39:45,049 --> 02:39:47,268
- Come and get me, too!
- Tony!

1790
02:39:47,343 --> 02:39:48,344
Who's that?

1791
02:39:48,428 --> 02:39:51,432
- It's me, Anybodys. Come on.
- Get out of here!

1792
02:39:51,514 --> 02:39:55,394
- Chino, come and get me, damn you!
- What are you doin'?

1793
02:39:55,476 --> 02:39:56,898
Get out of here!

1794
02:39:57,353 --> 02:39:59,151
Why don't you come with me?
We'll find...

1795
02:39:59,230 --> 02:40:01,824
It ain't playin' anymore!
Can't any of you get that?

1796
02:40:01,899 --> 02:40:05,654
- But the gang...
- You're a girl! Be a girl and beat it!

1797
02:40:12,702 --> 02:40:15,546
Come on, Chino! Get me, too!

1798
02:40:30,678 --> 02:40:32,806
I'm callin' for you, Chino!

1799
02:40:33,764 --> 02:40:37,143
There's nobody here but me. Come on!

1800
02:40:38,144 --> 02:40:39,771
Please, will you?

1801
02:40:41,522 --> 02:40:43,399
I'm waitin' for you.

1802
02:40:44,108 --> 02:40:45,610
I want you to.

1803
02:40:56,829 --> 02:40:58,001
Maria.

1804
02:40:59,248 --> 02:41:00,340
Tony!

1805
02:41:03,836 --> 02:41:05,008
Maria.

1806
02:41:42,792 --> 02:41:44,760
I didn't believe hard enough.

1807
02:41:44,835 --> 02:41:46,462
Loving is enough.

1808
02:41:47,296 --> 02:41:48,593
Not here.

1809
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:53,561
- They won't let us be.
- Then we'll get away.

1810
02:41:57,848 --> 02:41:58,974
Yeah.

1811
02:41:59,392 --> 02:42:00,644
- We can.
- Yes.

1812
02:42:00,726 --> 02:42:02,103
- We will.
- Yes.

1821
02:43:28,189 --> 02:43:30,533
How do you fire this gun, Chino?

1822
02:43:31,400 --> 02:43:33,949
Just by pulling this little trigger?

1823
02:43:34,528 --> 02:43:36,906
How many bullets are left, Chino?

1824
02:43:37,698 --> 02:43:39,245
Enough for you?

1825
02:43:39,408 --> 02:43:40,660
And you?

1826
02:43:42,370 --> 02:43:43,747
All of you!

1827
02:43:43,996 --> 02:43:47,717
You all killed him, and
my brother, and Riff...

1828
02:43:48,334 --> 02:43:50,382
not with bullets and guns.

1829
02:43:51,128 --> 02:43:52,471
With hate!

1830
02:43:53,255 --> 02:43:57,010
I can kill, too, because
now I have hate!

1831
02:43:57,593 --> 02:44:00,517
How many can I kill, Chino? How many?

1832
02:44:01,097 --> 02:44:03,771
And still have one bullet left for me?

1833
02:44:10,564 --> 02:44:11,611
No!

1834
02:44:25,621 --> 02:44:27,749
Don't you touch him!

1835
02:45:22,511 --> 02:45:24,605
Te adoro, Anton.

1836
02:52:53,378 --> 02:52:54,379
