鲨鱼最烂

27
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,440
喷射机
Jets!

28
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,480
不要打了！停手 我说，不要打了
Break it up, you punks! Cut it out! Come on, guys! Break it up, I said!

29
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,540
不要打了！要说几次 你们这些混混才不会再打
Come on, break it up! Come on! How many times have I told you punks to cut this stuff out?

30
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,450
- 可不是眩克警官吗？ - 眩克警官，你今天好啊
- Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank! - Top of the day, Lt. Schrank.

31
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,990
- 还有克鲁克警官 - 克鲁克警官，您今天好啊
- And Officer Krupke. - Top of the day, Officer Krupke.

32
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,370
- 好你个头 - 你，下来
- I'll give you the top of the head. - Hey you, get down!

33
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,250
- 我们在玩呢 - 充分利用这片游乐场
- But we're having such fun. - We enjoy the playground.

34
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,340
让我们这些被剥夺的儿童 不致在街头玩耍
See, it keeps us deprived children off of the foul city streets.

35
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,510
- 闭嘴 - 我们就像是在红砖道上生的
Shut up! And born like we was on the hot pavement.

36
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,470
- 要我敲碎你脑袋吗？ - 小约翰，过来这儿
- You wanna get your skull broke? - Hey, Baby John, come here! Come here!

37
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,890
哪一个波多黎各人 把你打伤的
All right! Now, which one of these Puerto Ricans bloodied you?

38
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,520
- 嗯，长官- -  - 哪一个？
- Sir... - Which one?

39
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,190
对不起，长官
Excuse me, sir.

40
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,190
其实…
As a matter of fact...

41
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,530
我们怀疑是被警察打的
we suspicion that the job was done by a cop.

42
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,660
- 两个警察 - 至少两个
- Two cops. - At the very least.

43
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,540
- 不可能 - 在美国，没有什么不可能的
Impossible. In America, nothing is impossible.

44
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,290
好了，聪明人 你们都听好了
All right, wise guys... now, you listen to me!

45
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,380
全部的人 这些街道不是你们的
All of you! You hoodlums don't own these streets.

46
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,130
这里有其他的地方 我要好好管一管的
And I've had all the roughhouse I'm gonna put up with around here!

47
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,550
你们要杀来杀去 请便！但不要在我在的时候
You wanna kill each other, kill each other! But you ain't gonna do it on my beat!

48
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,350
- 有没有问题 - 有，长官
- Are there any questions? - Yes, sir.

49
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,890
您可不可以将那段话 翻成西班牙文
Would you mind translating that into Spanish?

50
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,060
伯纳多，把你的人带走
Get your friends out of here, Bernardo.

51
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,610
请你…
And stay out!

52
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
走远一点
Please.

53
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,200
好吧，鲨鱼们
Okay, Sharks.

54
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,340
Vámonos.

55
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,930
好像这个社区还不够烂一样
Boy, oh boy! As if this neighborhood wasn't crummy enough!

56
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,930
大伙儿 我们讲理一点，嗯？
Now, look, fellas. Fellas! Look, let's be reasonable...

57
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,440
如果我不把这儿管好…
if I don't get a little law and order around here...

58
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,150
我就得到 十字路口管交通
I get busted down to a traffic corner...

59
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,400
我不喜欢十字路口
and your friend don't like traffic corners.

60
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,030
所以现在开始，你们要和 这些波多黎各人好好相处
So, that means you're gonna start makin' nice... with the PR's from now on.

61
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,950
好好相处！知道吗？
I said nice! Get it?

62
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,990
如果你们做不到…
'Cause if you don't...

63
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,210
让我发现你们 在我的地盘上有动作…
and I catch any of you doin' any more brawlin' in my territory...

64
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:30,800
我会揍扁你，关到牢里 让你在那儿待着等死
I'm gonna personally beat the livin' crud out of each and every one of you... and see that you go to the can and rot there!

65
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,140
- 克鲁克，向这些好孩子说再见 - 再见，孩子们
- Say good-bye to the nice boys, Krupke. - Good-bye, boys.

66
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,810
“再见，孩子们”
"Good-bye, boys."

67
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,230
- 吃牢饭？天哪 - “这些街道不是你们的”
Jail? Gee. "You hoodlums don't own the streets."

68
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,570
- “到公园去玩” - “不要践踏草坪”
Go play in the park. Keep off of the grass.

69
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,650
- “出去房子外面” - “不要在这条街上”
- Get out of the house! - Keep off the block.

70
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,650
- “出去” - “离开世界！”
- Get outta here. - Keep off the world!

71
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,450
没有地盘的帮派 什么都不是
A gang that don't own the street is nothin'!

72
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,160
这是我们的地盘
We do own it!

73
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
来吧，喷射机，集合
Come on, Jets, round out!

74
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,330
- 不是指你，所有其他的人！滚吧 - 芮夫，让我加入
- Not you, Anybodys! Beat it! - Riff, you gotta let me in the gang!

75
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,340
你没看到我吗？我很帅 我是杀手，我要打架
Didn't you just see me? I was smash! I'm a killer, I wanna fight.

76
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,050
她没别的办法让男人碰她
How else she gonna get a guy to touch her?

77
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,380
- 你这脏老鼠 - 小女孩，走人！上路
- You dirty rat! - Come on, the road, little girl! The road!

78
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,550
滚吧
Beat it!

79
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,510
- 滚吧 - 好了，来
- Beat it! - Okay, come on.

80
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,110
我们很辛苦拿下这地盘的 不会就这样放弃的
Okay, now listen! Now, we fought hard for this turf, and we ain't just gonna give it up.

81
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,200
翡翠帮宣称是他们的，但被打败了 老鹰帮曾想染指但没成功
The Emeralds claimed it, we shot 'em out. The Hawks, remember? They tried to take it away, we knocked them down the cellar.

82
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,030
- 这些波多黎各人不一样 - 他们增加得很快
- But these PR's are different. - They multiply. Like cockroaches.

83
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,580
- 吃掉所有的食物 - 呼吸了所有的空气
- Shut the door! - They're eatin' all the food. - Breathin' all the air.

84
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,710
- 救命！我被墨西哥菜淹死了 - 你听到眩克警官说的话了：
- Help! I'm drowning in tamale. And you heard what that Lt. Schrank said...

85
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,920
我们必须要和他们和平相处
we gotta make nice with them Puerto Ricans or else.

86
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,680
我们眼睁睁地看着他们 把一切夺走
We gotta let 'em move in right under our noses... - and take it all away from us or else. - No!

87
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,680
你说的对，绝不
You're damn right, no!

88
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,930
那我们要怎么办？ 我告诉你怎么办
So what're we gonna do, buddy boys? I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

89
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,720
我们动作要快
We're gonna speed back!

90
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,610
要如闪电一般 一次把鲨鱼帮剿清
We're gonna move like lightnin', and we're gonna clean them Sharks up... once and for all.

91
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,230
让他们再不会踏入我们的地盘
So they ain't never gonna set foot on our turf again!

92
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,030
一次就把他们打败
We're gonna do it in one all-out fight.

93
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,240
- 大干一场 - 冷静下来，猛男
- A rumble! Chop, chop! - Now cool, Action Boy.

94
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,580
鲨鱼帮要一席之地 他们很猛的
The Sharks want a piece of this world, too. And they're real down boys.

95
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,910
他们可能会动刀动枪的
They might ask for blades...

96
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,710
动枪？我的天
- zip guns. - Zip guns?

97
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,250
小约翰，我没说他们一定会
I ain't finalizin' and sayin' they will, Baby John.

98
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,760
只是说他们可能会 我们要准备好
I'm just sayin' that they might, and we gotta be prepared.

99
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,760
大家怎么说？
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

100
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,060
- 我说干吧 - 动手
- I say go, go! - I say mix!

101
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,640
- 打烂他们 - 扯烂他们
- I say sock 'em! - Tear them!

102
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,520
- 可是如果他们动到刀枪… - 算了吧
- Yeah, but if they say blades or guns... - I say let's just forget the whole thing.

103
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,860
- 什么？ - 你的意见呢，芮夫？
- What? - What do you say, Riff?

104
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,940
我们的地盘虽小 但却是我们仅有的
I say this turf is small, but it's all we got.

105
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,360
没错

106
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,320
我们要和从前一样 捍卫我们的地盘
I wanna hold it like we always held it, with skin!

107
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,540
如果他们用刀 我们就用刀
But if they say blades, I say blades.

108
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,670
如果他们动枪 我们就动枪
If they say guns, I say guns.

109
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,920
喷射机永远是老大
I say I want the Jets to be the number one!

110
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,090
- 出发！撑住一片天 - 发动了
- To sail! To hold the sky! - Then rev us off! Voom va-voom!

111
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,630
好，伙伴们，我们动手
Okay, cats, we rumble!

112
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,470
礼仪上我们要先和鲨鱼帮开会 确定战斗时间
Now... protocality calls for a war council... between us and the Sharks to set the whole thing up.

113
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,640
我们亲自通知伯纳多 这个坏消息
So I will personally give the bad news to Bernardo.

114
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,730
- 带个副手去 - 就是我了
- You gotta take a lieutenant with you. - That's me.

115
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,690
- 该是东尼 - 谁需要东尼？
- That's Tony. - Who needs Tony?

116
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,070
我们需要东尼 他的名声大过整个西城
We need Tony! He's got a rep that's bigger than the whole West Side!

117
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,490
- 他不再是我们一份子了 - 不要说了，猛男
- He don't belong no more. - Now, cut it, Action!

118
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,620
- 我和东尼创下喷射机帮的 - 现在他在那儿？
- Me and Tony started the Jets. - So where is he?

119
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,290
- 他的工作怎么那么烂？ - 青年会腐化了他
- How come he takes a lousy, stinkin' job? - Youth Board corrupted him.

120
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,000
- 暂时性的症状！等着看吧 - 记得我们打败翡翠帮的事吗？
- Yeah, temporary sickness! - Wait and see. Remember them fists the day we clobbered the Emeralds?

121
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,750
- 他救了我一命 - 他仍然会这么做的
- He saved my ever-loving neck! - Sure! He'll do it again, too!

122
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,170
他一直都帮着我们 以后也会一样
He always came through for us and he always will.

123
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,180
当你成为喷射机的一员 你永远都是
∮When you're a Jet you're a Jet all the way ∮

124
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,640
从你的第一支烟 到你死的那天
∮From your first cigarette to your last dyin' day ∮

125
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,640
当你是喷射机的一员 就让他们照顾你
∮When you're a Jet let 'em do what they can ∮

126
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,150
四海之内皆你兄弟 你是家族的一份子
∮You've got brothers around ∮ ∮You're a family man ∮

127
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,060
永远不寂寞 关系永远在那儿
∮You're never alone ∮ ∮You're never disconnected ∮

128
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,660
当你跟同伴在家 而且等着客人时
∮You're home with your own ∮ ∮When company's expected ∮

129
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,240
你会被保护好好的
∮You're well-protected ∮

130
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,070
一切都由喷射机 安排好了
∮Then you are set with a capital 'J' ∮

131
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,410
你不会忘记这一切的 直到你被抬走的那天
∮Which you'll never forget till they cart you away ∮

132
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,870
你是喷射机一员时
∮When you're a Jet ∮

133
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,000
你永远都是
∮You stay a ∮ ∮Jet ∮

134
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,460
我了解东尼就像了解自己一般 我们可以算他一份
Now, I know Tony like I know me, and I guarantee you can count him in.

135
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,050
- 走吧 - 去哪儿找伯纳多？
- Let's get crackin'. - Where will you find Bernardo?

136
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,010
- 在波多黎各人的地盘可不安全 - 去舞会那儿
- It ain't safe in PR territory. - He'll be at tonight's gym dance.

137
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,260
- 可是体育馆是中立区 - 我会好好对他讲的
- But the gym's neutral territory. - A-Rab, I'm gonna make nice with him.

138
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,890
- 只是向他下战书 - 好吧，小老爹
- I'm only gonna challenge him. - Right, daddy-o.

139
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,890
听着，大家盛装打扮
So listen, everybody dress up sweet and sharp.

140
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,190
10点时和我与东尼 在体育馆碰面
Meet Tony and me at the dance after 10:00, and walk tall!

141
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,320
- 我们永远抬头挺胸 - 我们是喷射机
- We always walk tall! - We're Jets!

142
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,690
最伟大的
The greatest!

143
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,530
当你是喷射机一员时 你是城里最亮眼的
∮When you're a Jet ∮ ∮You're the top cat in town ∮

144
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,160
你是带着皇冠的 - 金牌小子
∮You're the gold-medal kid ∮ ∮With the heavyweight crown ∮

145
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,040
当你是喷射机一员时 - 你可以大摇大摆
∮When you're a Jet ∮ ∮You're the swinginest thing ∮

146
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,500
男孩，你是一个男人 男人，你是国王
∮Little boy you're a man ∮ ∮Little man, you're a king ∮

147
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,420
喷射机已上紧发条 整装待发
∮The Jets are in gear ∮ ∮Our cylinders are clickin' ∮

148
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,340
鲨鱼帮将会片甲不留
∮The Sharks'll steer clear ∮

149
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,630
因为波多黎各人都是胆小鬼
∮'Cause every Puerto Rican's a lousy chicken ∮

150
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,300
喷射机来了 像地狱来的蝙蝠
∮Here come the Jets ∮ ∮Like a bat out of hell ∮

151
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,650
如果有人来挡路 他的日子不好过了
∮Someone gets in our way ∮ ∮Someone don't feel so well ∮

152
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,470
喷射机来了 世界为之让路
∮Here come the Jets ∮ ∮Little world, step aside ∮

153
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,740
最好藏到地下 快逃，快藏起来
∮Better go underground ∮ ∮Better run, better hide ∮

154
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,650
我们画下了界限 所以好好地藏匿吧
∮We're drawin' the line ∮ ∮So keep your noses hidden ∮

155
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,900
我们挂起了招牌 “严禁访客”
∮We're hangin' a sign ∮ ∮Says 'visitors forbidden' ∮

156
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,360
我们不是开玩笑的
∮And we ain't kiddin' ∮

157
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,320
喷射机来了 我们要打败
∮Here come the Jets, yeah ∮ ∮And we're gonna beat ∮

158
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,740
这整条街上的每一个帮派
∮Every last buggin' gang ∮ ∮On the whole buggin' street ∮

159
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:58,540

∮On the whole buggin' ∮ ∮Ever-lovin' ∮ ∮Street ∮

160
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,550
Yeah!

161
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,050
- 东尼，你没在听我说话 - 我听得很清楚
- Tony, you're not even listenin'. - I read you loud and clear, Riff.

162
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,300
- 说点话嘛 - 我不想伤你感情
- Then why don't you say somethin'? - I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

163
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,800
- 你是我最好的朋友 - 从生到死？
- You're my buddy, my pal, my best friend! - Womb to tomb?

164
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,930
从生到死
Birth to earth.

165
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,270
所以你一定要和我一起去舞会 - 挺我一挺
That's why you gotta come to the dance tonight and stand up with me.

166
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,480
东尼，答应我
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.

167
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,740
你有没有想过一瓶汽水里 - 有多少泡泡？
Riff, did you ever stop to figure... how many bubbles there are in one bottle of this here soda pop?

168
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,660
- 东尼，这很重要！ - 每件事都很重要，芮夫
Tony, this is important! Everything's important, Riff...

169
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,490
你，我，我的老板达克
you, me, the sweet guy I work for.

170
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,410
鲨鱼帮不是好东西，很狠的
The Sharks walk bad. They bite hard.

171
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,080
- 如果现在不阻止他们- -  - 来！为生活工作
- And if we don't stop them now... - Here! Work for a living.

172
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,340
觉得如何？多年来 我和好朋友的家人共住
How do you like that? Four and a half years I live with a buddy and his family.

173
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,630
我想我很了解他
I think I'm diggin' a guy's character.

174
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,430
- 我对你太失望了 - 你可以结束你的苦难
Boy, am I a victim of disappointment in you! End your sufferin', little man.

175
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,680
你何不打包搬出去？
Why don't you just pack up your gear and move out?

176
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,980
因为你妈喜欢我
'Cause your ma's hot for me.

177
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,320
不！因为我不想 和我烦人的叔叔住
No! It's 'cause I hate livin' with my buggin' uncle!

178
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,900
- 少来 - 叔叔
- Come on! - Come on, uncle!

179
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:16,200
- 去吧，和喷射机去玩吧 - 为什么不？他们是最棒的
Now... go play games with the Jets. And why not? They're the greatest.

180
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,700
不是吗？
Ain't they?

181
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,870
曾经是
Were.

182
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,710
“曾经是” 你找到更好的吗？
You found somethin' better?

183
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,040
没有，还没有，可是…
No. Not yet, but...

184
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,170
可是什么？
But What?

185
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,220
你不会相信的，芮夫
You won't dig it, Riff.

186
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,550
试试看
So try me.

187
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,390
东尼，试试我会不会相信
Come on, Tony, try me.

188
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,680
好吧
Okay.

189
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,150
上个月每天晚上我都醒来…
Every single night for the last month, I wake up...

190
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,280
我深深地被感动了
and I'm reaching out.

191
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,120
- 被什么？ - 我不知道
- For what? - I don't know.

192
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,570
女人吗？
A dame?

193
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,040
就在门前，就在转角的地方…
It's right outside the door, just around the corner...

194
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,410
那个什么就要来了
but it's comin'.

195
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,460
什么东西？
What is?

196
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,710
我不知道，但那感觉就像 以前我是喷射机一员时一样
I don't know. It... it's like the kick I used to get from bein' a Jet.

197
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,690
这么说就对了 不在帮派里，你就是个孤儿
Now you're talkin'! Man, without a gang, you're an orphan.

198
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,100
在帮派里，你是成群结队的
With a gang, you walk in twos, threes, fours...

199
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,310
当你的伴都是一流的 当你是喷射机一员时…
and your crew is the best... when you're a Jet, you're out in the sun, buddy boy...

200
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,980
你就像沐浴在太阳之下 回到家了
you're home free home!

201
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,440
芮夫，我有过那样的感觉
Riff, I've had it!

202
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,440
东尼
Tony...

203
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,070
- 你看着我 - 我在看着你
Tony, look at me, will ya? - Come on, look at me. - I'm lookin' at you.

204
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,870
我从来没向人开口 要求过什么，是吧？
Now, I never asked the time of day from a clock, did I?

205
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,870
我从来没向人开口要求什么 我现在开口求你
I never asked nothin' from nobody, but I'm askin' you...

206
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,420
今晚来舞会

207
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,710
- 我答应达克打扫店里的 - 去了舞会再回去打扫
I promised Doc I'd clean up the store tonight. Then do it after the dance.

208
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,130
东尼，我已经告诉大家 你会到场的
Tony, I already told the guys you'd be there.

209
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,340
如果你不出现 大家会认为我很没用
If you don't show, I'll be marked lousy.

210
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,600
- 你告诉他们几点？ - 10点
What time'd you tell 'em? 10:00.

211
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,560
东尼，为了我，为了芮夫
For me, Tony, for Riff!

212
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,650
就10点吧
- 10:00 it is. - Womb to tomb?

213
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,900
- 由生至死？ - 由生至死，我会后悔这么做的
Birth to earth, and I'll live to regret this.

214
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,280
也许你一直等待的东西 就在舞会上出现
Who knows? Maybe what you're waitin' for'll be twitchin' at the dance tonight.

215
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,990

- 把领口开低一点 - 你不要再妨碍我
- Stop it, Maria. - You must make the neck lower. And you must stop heckling me.

253
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,150
我们可是活在现在 不是老祖母时代
We are working on our time now, not the old lady's.

254
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,280
一寸就好了 一寸又没有多少？
- One inch. How much can one little inch do?

255
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,160
太多了
- Too much.

256
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,490
艾尼塔，这是件舞衣 不是祈祷袍
Anita, it is now to be a dress for dancing, no longer for praying!

257
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,330
听着，和那些男孩一起 由跳舞开始，结局是你得祈祷
Listen, with those boys, you can start in dancing and end up praying.

258
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,630
请你再往下一寸
Querida, one little inch.

259

我已经来到这个国家一个月 碰到过任何新鲜事吗？
One month have I been in this country. Do I ever even touch excitement?

261
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,510
在这里缝衣一整天 在家里枯坐一整夜
I sew in this place all day. I sit at home all night.

262
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,100
我哥哥到底带我来这儿干嘛？
For what did my fine brother bring me here?

263
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,680
- 来嫁给奇诺 - 奇诺
- To marry Chino. - Chino.

264
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,360
- 我看着奇诺时，什么感觉都没有 - 你期望会有什么感觉？
- When I look at Chino, nothing happens. - What do you expect to happen?

265
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,070
我不知道，某种感觉
I don't know. Something.

266
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,740
你看着伯纳多时，有什么感觉？
What happens when you look at Bernardo?

267
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,160
事情都是在 我没看着他时发生的
It's when I don't look that it happens.

268
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,450
我想我要告诉爸妈…
I think I will tell Mama and Papa

269
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,870
你和伯纳多在电影院阳台上的事
about you and Nardo in the balcony...

270
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,880
- 我要把这撕碎 - 不
of the movies! - I will rip this to shreds! - No!

271
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,510
如果你能把领口弄低一点…
But if you perhaps could manage to lower the neck...

272
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,800
- 明年 - 我讨厌这件衣服
Next year. I hate that dress!

273
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,390
那就不要穿 也不要和我们去舞会
Then don't wear it, and don't come to the dance with us tonight.

274
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,810
不去？
Don't come?

275
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,820
- 至少把它染成红色的呢？ - 不行
- Could we not dye it red at least? - No, we could not.

276
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,440
白色是给小孩子穿的
White is for babies.

277
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,280
我会是唯一穿白色的- -
I will be the only one there in a white...

278
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,170
Sí.

279
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,880
好漂亮
It is a beautiful dress.

280
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,800
我爱你
I love you!

281
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,760
- 小姐们，准备好了吗？ - 伯纳多，进来，好不好看？
- Are you ready, ladies? - Nardo, come in. Is it not beautiful?

282
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,930
很好
Yes.

283
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,140
- 很好 - 我没听清楚

284
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,690
非常美丽

285
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,940
奇诺，进来，不要怕
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.

286
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,780
- 这是女装店 - 等我们认识你了才会咬你
- But this is a shop for ladies. - We won't bite you till we know you better.

287
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,870
奇诺，今晚好好替我看着玛丽亚 你也一样，艾尼塔
Chino, you will keep both eyes on Maria tonight in case I cannot. You too, Anita.

288
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:16,450
- 我哥是只傻傻的看门狗 - 我妹妹是颗宝石
- My brother is a silly watchdog. - My sister is a precious jewel.

289
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,170
我是什么？刻宝石的刀
What am I? Cut glass?

290
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,000
最重要的是 我今晚能在舞会能玩得开心
Nardo, it is most important that I have a wonderful time at the dancing tonight.

291
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,260
是吗？
It is?

292
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,630
因为今晚是我真正…
Because tonight is the real beginning of my life...

293
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,680
在美国生活的开始

我还没学会怎么开这种玩笑

642
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,030
再见啦！
I'll see you around.

643
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,910
- 你忘了说再见 - 他们真没礼貌
You forgot to say good-bye. Them headbusters ain't got no manners.

644
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:05,420
“等我回来时 不要让我看到你们”
"And don't let me catch none of youse here later!"

怎么样？ 没事，对吧？
So, what happened? A big fat nothin', right?

647
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,840
如果他正好在我们 开战前会时回来怎么办？
Yeah, but suppose he comes back... while we are havin' the war council?

648
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,430
我们就给他好看
We'll snow him some more. See, them cops...

649
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:20,930
他们警察相信报上 所有关于我们这种人的说法
they believe everything they read in the papers about us JD's.

650
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:24,600

656
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,830

∮Our mothers all are junkies ∮ ∮Our fathers all are drunks ∮

657
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,790

∮We never had the love that every child oughta get ∮

660
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,010

∮We ain't no delinquents, we're misunderstood ∮

661
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,400

- Just tell it to the judge. - Who's gonna be the judge?

666
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:28,460

∮They didn't wanna have me ∮ ∮But somehow I was had ∮

669
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,380

这孩子不需要法官 他需要心理分析师的帮助
∮This boy don't need a judge ∮ ∮He needs an analyst's care ∮

672
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:48,350
是他的精神官能症 需要被约束
∮It's just his neurosis that ought to be curbed ∮

673
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,650

677
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,040
这个孩子的堕落 是因为他没有一个好的家庭
on account he ain't had a normal home.

678
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,670
嘿，我堕落是因为我堕落

01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:04,520
害怕决定吗？
Afraid to call?

759
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,690
石头
Rocks.

760
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,360
皮带
Belts.

761
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,440
- 管子 - 罐头
- Pipes. - Cans.

762
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,070
- 砖头 - 球棒
- Bricks. - Bats.

763
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,240
- 棍子 - 铁链
- Clubs. - Chains.

764
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:20,700
瓶子，刀子，枪 一堆胆小鬼
Bottles, knives, guns! - What a coop full of chickens. - Who are you callin' chicken?

765
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,620
- 谁是胆小鬼？ - 物以类聚
- Every dog knows his own. - I'm calling you all chicken!

766
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:28,880
你们都是胆小鬼！硬汉丢石头的 害怕近距离
Big, tough buddy boys gotta throw bricks. Afraid to get in close?

767
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,420
怕肉搏受伤吗？
Afraid to slug it out? Afraid to use plain skin?

768
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,880
- 连垃圾都不行？ - 那不是打架
- Not even garbage? - That ain't a rumble.

769
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:36,130
- 谁说的？ - 你说要决定武器的
- Who says? - You said call weapons.

770
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,720
打架可以是很公平的 如果你们敢冒这个险
A rumble can be clinched by a fair fight, if you've got the guts to risk that.

771
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:43,350
一边选出一个最好的来对决
Best man from each gang to slug it out.

772
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,560
我很愿意冒这个险 好，公平地打一架
I would enjoy to risk that. Okay. Fair fight.

773
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:52,110
等一等 领导人说行或不行
Wait a minute! The commanders say yes or no.

774
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:55,070
公平地打一架
Fair fight.

775
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:02,410
等我把你修理完 你会像是去皮的鱼儿一般
When I get through with you, you will be like a fish after skinning.

776
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,200
你们最行的 和我们最行的打一架
Your best man fights our best man.

777
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:08,540
我们选他
And we pick him.

778
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:12,420
- 我以为我会和他打- -  - 你已经握手同意了
- But I thought I would be fighting with... - You shook on it.

779
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,890
- 是啊，我已经握手同意了 - 如果你改变心意- -
Yes. I shook on it. Look, Bernardo, if you wanna change your mind...

780
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,070
- 伯纳多，宝贝，来根烟吗？ - 不，谢了，我不抽烟
Bernardo, baby, would you like a cigarette? No, thank you. I don't smoke.

781
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:36,780
那是什么？

782
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,820
晚安，警官
Evening, Lieutenant.

783
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,160
我和东尼正准备打烊
I and Tony was just closing up.

784
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:51,040
各位，这才对嘛 看你们这样使我心头暖烘烘的
Now, this is more like it, fellas. Warms me all over to see you this way.

785
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,630
我在球场那里说了几句话后 就有这样的成效
And after only a couple of words from me at the playground. How about that?

786
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,760
- 介意吗？ - 不，我是个白痴
Do you mind? I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.

787
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,010
总部得听话这件事的话 搞不好我还能升官呢
You know, headquarters hears about this, I may even get a promotion.

788
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,570
伯纳多，不错嘛 我升官…
Good deal all around, Bernardo? I get a promotion...

789
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:14,360
你们波多黎各人 得到你们一直想要的：
and you Puerto Ricans get what you've been itchin' for...

790
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:20,360
使用球场，使用体育馆 街上，糖果店
use of the playground, use of the gym... the streets, the candy store.

791
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:24,200
就算他们把这里变成猪舍 又怎样呢？
So what if they do turn this whole town into a stinkin' pigsty?

792
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,950
别阻止他！他想回家的话 写封信回去…
Don't stop him! He wants to get home, write letters to San Juan...

793
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,000
告诉他们他在这儿的成就
tell 'em how he's got it made over here!

794
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:35,250
我的意思是，走人 我说，走人
What I mean is, clear out, you! I said, clear out!

795
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,180
是啊，我知道
Yeah, sure, I know.

796
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,350
这是个自由的国家，我没有权利 但我有警徽
It's a free country, and I ain't got the right. But I got a badge.

797
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,600
你有什么？
What do you got?

798
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,940
就是这么一回事，滚
Things are tough all over. Beat it!

799
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:26,470
好了，各位…
Okay, fellas...

800
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,600
打架地点在那儿？
where's the rumble gonna be?

801
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,820
来吧！正常美国人是不会- -
Come on! Regular Americans don't rub with the gold teeth unless...

802
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,570
- 警官- -  - 你闭嘴
- Lieutenant... - You shut your mouth!

803
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:45,820
小约翰，在你这个小滑头 被砍成两半之前说吧
Come on, Baby John. Before that smooth little kisser of yours gets out up for life.

804
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:47,950
在哪儿会面？
Now, where's it gonna be?

805
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,620
河边？
The river?

806
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:51,950
公园里？
The park?

807
01:17:55,250 --> 01:18:00,710
我是支持你们的 我希望你们帮我扫除他们
Look, fellas, I'm for you. I want this beat cleaned up, and you can do it for me.

808
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:05,840
如果事情不顺，我甚至会帮忙你们 你们在哪里决斗？
I'll even lend a hand if things get rough. Now, where you gonna rumble?

809
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,310
游乐场？
The playground?

810
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,140
停车场？
Sweeney's lot?

811
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,190
你这个笨蛋 能不能放聪明点？
Why don't you get smart, you stupid hooligans?

812
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,110
我应该现在把你抓去关
I ought to take you to the station and throw you in the can now!

813
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,530
你和那些自大的移民
You and the tinhorn immigrant scum you come from!

814
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,960
你爸可好？
How's your old man's DT's, A-Rab?

815
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:40,630
猛男，你妈可好？
How's the action on your mother's side of the street, Action?

816
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:44,470
总有一天，会没人拉住你的
One of these days, there won't be anybody to hold you.

817
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:47,510
把他弄出去 去！滚吧！走
Get him out of here! Come on! Beat it! Go!

818
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,180
我会找出你们决斗的地点的
Don't worry! I'll find out where it's gonna be.

819
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:55,060
你们最好彼此收拾干净 不然我来收拾你们
So be sure to finish each other off, because if you don't, I will!

820
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:05,820
是啊
Yeah, sure.

821
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,450
去了解他们
Understand them.

822
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:11,660
总部老是教我们“了解”
That's what they keep telling me down at headquarters. "Understand."

823
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:16,120
试着要这些混混安份一点 结果就是如此
You try keeping hoodlums in line, and see what it does to you.

824
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:23,090
也不会让我的嘴那么坏
It wouldn't give me a mouth like his.

825
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,180
好了，达克
Come on, Doc.

826
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,600
- 别生气了 - 真是恶心
- Don't let it get you. - I'm sick.

827
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,430
- 你也听见了，会是公平的一架 - 从此以后就一切没事
- You heard. It's gonna be a fair fight. - And that's gonna cure somethin'?

828
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,190
从此以后就一切没事
From here on in, everything's gonna be all right.

829
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:43,110
- 我感觉会这样 - 你今晚去干什么？
- Got a feelin'. - What have you been takin' tonight?

830
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:46,530
我去了月球旅行 我告诉你个秘密
A trip to the moon! And I'll tell you a secret, Doc.

831
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:50,200
上面不是个男人在那儿 是个女孩
It ain't a man that's up there. it's a girl.

832
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,530
一位女士
A lady.

833
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,250
- Buenas noches, se?or - Buenas noches?

834
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,540
所以你促成一场公平决斗
So that's why you made it a fair fight.

835
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:08,050
- 真等不及明天和她见面 - 东尼！事情还不够糟糕吗？
I'm gonna see her tomorrow, and I can't wait. Tony! Things aren't tough enough?

836
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,010
- 糟糕？我恋爱了 - 你不害怕？
- Tough? Doc, I'm in love! - And you're not frightened?

837
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,720
我应该害怕吗？
Should I be?

838
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,720
不
No.

839
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:19,440
我替你们俩害怕
No, I'm frightened enough for the both of you.

840
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:14,530
- 奇诺对她做了什么？ - 奇诺？为什么是奇诺？
What has Chino done to her? Chino? Why Chino?

841
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:18,410
也许她是为我们打扮的
- Maybe she's just dolling up for us. - Gracias, querida.

842
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:23,290
我的好朋友 你们能守住秘密吗？
Rosalie, Consuelo, my adorable friends, can you keep a secret?

843
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:26,000
我最喜欢秘密了
I'm hot for secrets.

844
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,500
不，我不要告诉你
No. I won't tell you.

845
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:30,830
- 什么？ - “什么？”
- What? - "What?"

846
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,640
- 可怜的孩子疯了 - 我是疯了
The poor girl is out of her mind. I am! Crazy.

847
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,840
她很可能真的疯了 她看起来不太一样
She might be at that. She looks somehow different.

848
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,840
- 是吗？ - 我觉得她在计划着什么事
- I do? - And I think she is up to something.

849
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,390
我有吗？
I am?

850
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,350
“是吗？我有吗？” 像只鹦鹉一样
"I do? I am?" She talks like a parrot.

851
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,600
玛丽亚，你怎么了？
What is going on with you, Maria?

852
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:49,100
我觉得好美

∮See the pretty girl in that mirror there? ∮

862
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,260
那位迷人的女子会是谁呢？
∮Who can that attractive girl be? ∮

909

不然呢？ 我们用的是“歌者”牌缝衣机
But Madam Lucia, what can you expect? We use Singer sewing machines.

910
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:45,320
要开玩笑回家去开 不要让我听到
Sure. You make the bad joke home where I can't hear it.

- Adiós - The jail is open. I thought she'd never leave.

916
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:09,340
真不相信这个老巫婆 曾经像我们一样年轻
You know, it's hard to believe that old bag of a witch was once a young bag like us.

917
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:12,310
趁她改变心意回来之前 快走吧

They fight each other tonight? They don't play patsy.

929

他们为什么一定要打架？
Why must they always fight?

930
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:54,720
你看到他们跳舞的样子 一副要赶快除掉什么的样子
You saw how they dance, like they gotta get rid of something quick.

931
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:59,060
- 他们就是那样打架的 - 要除掉什么？
That's how they fight. To get rid of what?

932
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:02,860
太多的情绪 他们要去除那些情绪
Too much feeling. And they do get rid of it.

933

01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,550
说什么？ 我那里知道乐在云霄是什么？
Tell what? How can I know what goes on 12 feet over my head?

我已经阻止了 只会有两个人动拳头
I have stopped it. It'll only be a fistfight between two of 'em. Nardo...

953
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,950
任何打斗对我们都是不好的
Any fight is no good for us.

954

- 一切都是好的，我们有魔力 - 好好听我说

01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:40,260
他们打了一架
There was a fight.

1146
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:42,510
伯纳多…
And Nardo...

1147
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:45,510
有一把刀…
Somehow a knife...

1148
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:49,350
- 纳多和另一个人，他们- -  - 东尼
- And Nardo and someone, they... - Tony.

1149
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,810
东尼怎么了？
What happened to Tony?

1150
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,940
奇诺，你说！东尼没事吧？
Chino, tell me! Is Tony all right?

1151
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:01,320
他杀了你哥
He killed your brother!

1152
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:10,660
你说谎
You are lying.

1153
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:14,040
奇诺，你为什么对我说谎？
Chino, why do you lie to me?

1154
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:16,130
奇诺
Chino

1155
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,300
奇诺
Chino

1156
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:22,260
奇诺，真的，你在说谎！说谎 奇诺，你为什么对我说谎？
Chino, true, you are lying! Why? Why do you lie to me, Chino?

1157
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:24,850
- 奇诺 - 妈妈！妈妈
Mama! Mama!

1158
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:28,440
- Bernardo está muerto! - Bernardo, muerto?

1159
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:30,230
不
No!

1160
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:41,740
圣母玛丽亚，让它不是真的 请让它不是真的
Santa María, make it not be true. Please make it not be true.

1161
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:46,030
圣母玛丽亚，我做什么都可以 让我死
Madre de Dios, I will do anything. Make me die!

1162
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:49,160
只要让它不是真的
Only, please, make it not be true.

1163
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:54,710
让它不是- -
Make it not be...

1164
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:03,680
凶手！凶手！凶手！凶手 凶手！凶手！凶手
Killer!

1165
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,680
我试着阻止
I tried to stop it.

1166
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:13,350
我试了
I did try.

1167
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,190
我不知道那里错了 我并没有要伤害他
I don't know what went wrong. I didn't mean to hurt him. I didn't wanna.

1168
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,190
但芮夫就像我亲弟弟一样
But Riff's like my brother...

1169
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,860
当伯纳多杀了他时，伯纳多 也不是故意的，我- - 我知道
when Bernardo killed him, Bernardo didn't mean it either.

1170
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:29,030
我以为你知道
I thought you knew.

1171
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:35,920
我不是来告诉你那个的 请你原谅我…
I didn't come to tell you that.

1172
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:39,040
我才能去自首
Just for you to forgive me, so I can go to the police.

1173
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:41,050
- 不 - 会很简单的
- No! - It'll be easy now.

1174
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:42,670
- 我不让你去 - 我一定得去
- I won't let you! - I must.

1175
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,760
- 留下来！陪着我 - 玛丽亚，我好爱你
- Stay! Stay with me. - Maria, I love you so much!

1176
01:50:45,930 --> 01:50:49,180
- 不要离开我 - 你说什么我都会做
Don't leave me! Whatever you want, I'll do.

1177
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:51,770
- 抱紧我 - 永远
- Hold me! - Forever!

1178
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:53,520
- 再紧一点 - 我知道会没事的
Tighten

1179
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:58,110
我们现在真正在一起了
it'll be all right. I know it. We're really together now.

1180
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,730
不是我们
But it's not us.

1181
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:04,360
是我们周围的人
It's everything around us.

1182
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,620
我带你离开 到没有人找得到的地方
Then I'll take you away, where nothing can get to us.

1183
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:13,580
没有任何人
Not anyone or anything.

I don't want the guys to see me, A-Rab.

1213
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:09,670
为什么？
Why not?

1214
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:12,260
我在哭
I'm cryin'.

1215
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,760
你在哭？
You are?

1216
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:18,220
为什么？
What for?

1217
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:21,770
- 我不知道，我只是- -  - 擤擤鼻子

What's wrong with him? There's nothin' wrong. He's okay, you get it?

1232
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,430
好，好

1238
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:08,540
芮夫！我要芮夫
I want Riff!

1239
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:11,210
好了，葛莉拉
Come on, Graziella.

1240
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:16,420
不该有人死的
Nobody was supposed to get killed.

1241
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:18,050
只是…
It just...

1242
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:24,970
他们要付出代价的
They're gonna pay!

So why don't we finish it? We gotta show 'em who's on top.

1246
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:34,270
我们搞得还不够吗？
- The Jets! Let's do it now! - Ain't we had enough?

1247
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:37,690
- 怎么回事，你害怕了吗？ - 你说谁“怕了”
- What's the matter, you scared? - Who you callin' scared?

1248
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,450

Don't sound off on me. I'll...

住手
- You'll do what? - Knock it off!

1251
01:56:46,450 --> 01:56:50,500
闭嘴，你们这些没用的人 回家去
Shut up down there, you dirty bunch of good-for-nothings! Go home where you belong!

1252
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:53,130
你说谁“没用的人” 笨大嘴
Who you callin' good-for-nothin', you loudmouth crud head?

1253
01:56:53,290 --> 01:56:55,300

- 闭嘴 - 谁都不能那样对我
- Shut up! - I don't have to take that from nobody!

1256
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:09,270
下一个对我大小声的家伙 - 我发誓要- -
Next creep who sounds on me, I swear the next guy...

1257
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:10,690

现在你们全部要尽力
Now, you all better dig this and dig it good!

1260
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:24,740
不管什么事或什么人惹到你…
No matter who or what is eatin' you...

1261
01:57:24,910 --> 01:57:26,950
如果你露出什么你就完了
man, you show it, and you are dead!

1262
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:35,130
你就是自动送上去给人宰割…
You are cuttin' a hole in yourselves for them to stick in a red-hot umbrella...

1263
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:37,130
五马分尸
and open it wide!

1264
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:42,430
如果你们被警方问话想过关的话
Man, you wanna get past the cops when they start askin' about tonight?

1265
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:44,180
你保持冷静
You play it cool.

1266
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,640
你们想在这生存下去吗？
You wanna live in this lousy world?

1267
01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:49,980
保持冷静

02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:58,200
如果他们问到决斗的事

我很擅于隐藏

1315
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:18,930
我能像风一般地出入

And then I hear Chino say, "If it's the last thing I do, I'm gonna get that Polack."

1320
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:34,820

∮Your life ∮

1408
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:56,970
奇诺有枪
Chino has a gun.

1409
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:59,140
我听到他们在说
I heard the boys talking.

1410
02:10:59,310 --> 02:11:03,730
- 他要去找东尼 - 他在达克店里等我
- He's hunting for Tony. - He is at Doc's store, waiting for me.

1411
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:06,940
如果奇诺伤到他 如果他碰他，我发誓我要- -
If Chino hurts him, if he touches him, I swear to you, I'll...

1412
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:11,280
- 你要像东尼对伯纳多那样？ - 我爱东尼
- You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo. - I love Tony.

1413
02:11:11,610 --> 02:11:13,610
我知道
I know.

1414
02:11:14,110 --> 02:11:16,030
我爱伯纳多
I loved Bernardo.

1415
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:26,290
- 有人在家吗？ - 有
- Anybody home? - Yes.

1416
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:31,550
- 我找伯纳多的妹妹 - 她不舒服
- Bernardo's sister, please. - She isn't feeling well.

1417
02:11:31,710 --> 02:11:33,670
谁舒服呢？
Who is?

1418
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:37,840
小姐，你好
Hello, miss.

1419
02:11:38,010 --> 02:11:41,140
我是眩克警官，不好意思 在这种时候打扰你- -
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't like to disturb you at a time like this...

1420
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:44,680
对，的确不大方便 容我告退
Yes, a very bad time. You'll excuse me, please.

1421
02:11:44,850 --> 02:11:48,190
- 我有几个问题要问你 - 等我办完事
- I have a couple of questions to ask. - Afterwards, please.

1422
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:50,520
- 我要去我哥那里 - 等一下
- I must go to my brother now. - Now, just one minute!

1423
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:53,480
- 不能等吗？ - 不能
- Can't you wait? - No!

1424
02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:55,990
就现在
Now.

1425
02:11:56,150 --> 02:11:59,610
- 那天晚上在舞会上- -  - 这要很久吗？
You were at the dance at the gym last night... Will this take very long?

1426
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:01,830
需要多久就花多久时间
As long as it has to.

1427
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:05,080
对不起
Excuse me.

1428
02:12:05,250 --> 02:12:07,410
艾尼塔，我的头痛更严重了
Anita, my headache is much worse.

1429
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:11,630
- 你能帮我去达克店里吗？ - 你们家里都没止痛药吗？
Will you go to Doc's store for me? Don't you people keep aspirin around?

1430
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:14,050
那是特别的药
This is something special.

1431
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:17,760
艾尼塔，你能替我跑一趟吗？
Will you go for me, Anita?

1432
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:25,180
我要拿什么呢？
What shall I ask for?

1433
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:28,230
达克知道
Doc will know.

1434
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:33,400
告诉他我现在不能离开 不能过去…
Tell him I have been detained and can't get there right away...

1435
02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:36,150
不然我会自己去拿的
or I would have picked it up myself.

1436
02:12:46,870 --> 02:12:49,870
对不起，你刚在问什么？
Excuse me. You were asking?

1437
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:56,210
那天晚上在体育馆 你哥哥和人吵了起来…
Yeah. At the gym last night, your brother got into a heavy argument...

1438
02:12:56,210 --> 02:12:59,130
因为他不喜欢 你跳舞的对象
because you danced with the wrong boy.

1439
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:04,310
- 是的 - 那个男孩是谁？
- Yes. - Who was the boy?

1440
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:09,610
- 另一个波多黎各人 - 叫什么名字？
Another from my country. And his name?

1441
02:13:10,270 --> 02:13:12,190
荷西
José.

1442
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:24,070
- 找不到他 - 他在楼下仓库里
- Can't find him. He ain't nowhere. - He's right down there in the cellar.

1443
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:25,580
- 东尼吗？ - 安安全全的
- Tony? - Safe and sound.

1444
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:28,200
- 我找到他的 - 你告诉他奇诺的事了吗？
- I found him. - You warn him about Chino?

1445
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:31,790
- 他在仓库里干嘛？ - 陪老鼠
- What's he doin' in the cellar? - Keepin' the mice company, stupid.

1446
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:34,170
- 找不到奇诺吗？ - 找不到
- No sign of Chino? - Nothin'.

1447
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,590
算他运气
His luck.

1448
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:38,260
我再去巷子里找找 你们都在这儿等着
I'll slip out the back and check the alleys again.

1449
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:39,550
- 对 - 好
- You guys hang here. - Right.

1450
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:44,090
- 我好渴，达克在哪里？ - 在楼上替东尼筹钱
- Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc? - Upstairs raising getaway money for Tony.

1451
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:46,560
- 达克没有钱 - 他的床垫有
- Doc ain't got no money. - His mattress has.

1452
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:50,520
不要废话了 拿点东西来看，放点音乐
Come on. Cut the frabberjabber. Grab some readin' matter.

1453
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:54,560
你们出去街上看看 如果看到奇诺或是波多黎各人- -
Play the juke. Some of you get outside. If you see Chino or those stinkin' PR's comin...

1454
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:08,620
- 我想找达克 - 他不在
- I'd like to see Doc. - He ain't here.

1455
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:11,660
- 他去哪里？ - 他去银行了
- Where is he? - He went to the bank.

1456
02:14:11,830 --> 02:14:16,720
- 他们算错了他的帐 - 银行关门了，他在那里？
They made a mistake in his favor. The banks are closed at night. Where is he?

1457
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:20,590
你知道达克很瘦 他从晚间存钱口里滑进银行了
You know how skinny Doc is. He slipped in through the night-deposit slot.

1458
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,760
结果卡住了
And got stuck halfway in.

1459
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:26,470
所以我们不知道 他何时才会回来
Which indicates there's no tellin' when he'll be back.

1460
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:31,110
Buenas noches, se?orita.

1461
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:41,400
你去哪？
Where you goin'?

1462
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:46,530
- 楼下 - 我不是说他不在吗？
- Downstairs. - Didn't I tell you he ain't here?

1463
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:48,780
我想自己亲眼看看
I'd like to see for myself.

1464
02:14:51,330 --> 02:14:53,370
别这样
Please.

1465
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
别这样
Please.

1466
02:15:00,050 --> 02:15:01,390
Por favor.

1467
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:05,260
- 让我过去好吗？ - 她太黑了，过不去的
- Will you let me pass? - She's too dark to pass.

1468
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:07,180
- 不要 - 请不要
- Don't - Please don't.

1469
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:08,810
- Por favor. - No comprende.

1470
02:15:08,890 --> 02:15:10,190
- Gracias. - De nada.

1471
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:13,020
- 你听着 - 我们在听
Mambo! - Listen, you! - We're listenin'.

1472
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:16,310
我带了口信给你朋友
Look, I gotta give a friend of yours a message.

1473
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:18,310
- 我要告诉东尼- -  - 他不在这儿
- I gotta tell Tony... - He ain't here.

1474
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:19,820
- 我知道他在 - 谁说的？
- I know he is. - Who says he is?

1475
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:21,190
- 谁的口信 - 算了
- Who's the message from? - Never mind.

1476
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:26,830
- 会是奇诺的口信吗？ - 你们不了解吗？我想帮忙
Couldn't be from Chino, could it? Don't you understand? I want to help!

1477
02:15:26,860 --> 02:15:30,450
- 伯纳多的女人想帮忙 - 坏人也有感情的
- Bernardo's girl wants to help? - Even a greaseball's got feelings.

1478
02:15:30,620 --> 02:15:32,450
- 她想帮忙逮住东尼 - 不是的
- But she wants to help get Tony. - No!

1479
02:15:32,620 --> 02:15:36,290
- 伯纳多的女人 - 伯纳多的猪
- Not much. Bernardo's tramp. - Bernardo's pig!

1480
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:38,580
- 说谎大王 - 不要那样
- You lyin' Spic! - Don't do that.

1481
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:39,960
- 金牙齿 - 耳洞
- Gold tooth! - Pierced ear!

1482
02:15:40,130 --> 02:15:42,130
- 不要 - 大蒜嘴
- Don't. - Garlic mouth.

1483
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:47,220
- 我想帮忙 - 少来
- I want to help! - Come on!

1484
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:49,480
- Go! - Chiquita!

1485
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:51,600
No!

1486
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:55,530
Olé! Olé!

1487
02:15:55,940 --> 02:15:57,110
Hey, babe!

1488
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:59,100
少来
Come on!

1489
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:07,240
- 抓住她 - 不，不要
Let's get her! - No, you don't.

1490
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:12,450
- 来 - 来
- Come on, baby.

1491
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:17,670
Come on!

1492
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:19,630
住手
Stop it!

1493
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:26,590
你们在干什么？
What are you doing there?

1494
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:47,900
伯纳多是对的
Bernardo was right.

1495
02:16:49,610 --> 02:16:54,870
如果你们其中有人躺在路上流血…
If one of you... was lying in the street bleeding...

1496
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,700
我会走过去吐口水
l'd walk by and spit on you!

1497
02:16:57,870 --> 02:17:02,290
- 她会告诉奇诺东尼在仓库 - 不要碰我
She'll tell Chino that Tony's in the cellar. Don't you touch me!

1498
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,840
我有一个口信给你的 美国朋友
I got a message for your American buddy.

1499
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:13,510
告诉那个杀人犯 玛丽亚不会来了
You tell that murderer that Maria's never going to meet him!

1500
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:17,470
告诉他奇诺发现了他们的事…
You tell him that Chino found out about them...

1501
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,770
他杀了她
and shot her!

1502
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:22,650
她死了
She's dead!

1503
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:29,400
你们这些孩子何时才会停止？
When do you kids stop?

1504
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:33,030
你们让世界更糟
You make this world lousy!

1505
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:35,580
不是我们
We didn't make it, Doc.

1506
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,500
出去
Get outta here!

1507
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:10,990
玛丽亚
Maria?

1508
02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:13,820
达克，我好像听到- - 拿到钱了
Doc, I thought I heard... You got it!

1509
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:17,410
- 是，我拿到了 - 你真是个好朋友
- Yes, I got it. - Doc, you're a pal.

1510
02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:22,370
你是最好的好朋友 我一定尽快还给你
You're the best friend a guy ever had. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. I promise.

1511
02:18:22,370 --> 02:18:25,380
- 不用了 - 不，我要还你！我不能
- Forget that. - No, I'll never! I couldn't.

1512
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:28,670
你知道我和玛丽亚在乡下会怎么做？
Doc, you know what we're gonna do in the country, Maria and me?

1513
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:33,130
我们会用你的名字为小孩命名 即使是女孩，当你来看我们时- -
We'll have kids, and we'll name 'em all after you... even the girls, so when you visit us...

1514
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:35,050
醒来吧
Wake up!

1515
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:39,390
这是唯一让你听到的方法吗？
Is this the only way to get through to you...

1516
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:43,850
不顾一切地去做 然后像炸弹一样地爆炸？
do just what you all do, bust like a hot water pipe?

1517
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:45,400
你怎么了？
What's got into you?

1518
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:50,190
你们这些孩子 为什么活得像在打仗一样？
Why do you kids live like there's a war on?

1519
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:55,820
你为什么杀人？
Why do you kill?

1520
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:01,080
我告诉过你是怎么发生的
I told you how it happened.

1521
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:04,710
玛丽亚了解
Maria understands.

1522
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:09,250
- 我以为你也了解 - 玛丽亚不了解
- I thought you did, too. - Maria understands nothing...

1523
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:11,590
再也不会了
Never again.

1524
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:14,420
东尼，没有玛丽亚了
There is no Maria, Tony.

1525
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:18,930
什么？
What?

1526
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:23,480
- 我不能 - 不，达克
- I can't. - No, no, Doc.

1527
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:25,940
告诉我，怎么了？
Now, tell me. What is it?

1528
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:29,610
楼上刚刚是艾尼塔
That was Anita upstairs.

1529
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:33,530
奇诺发现你和玛丽亚的事…
Chino found out about you and Maria...

1530
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:36,360
他杀了她
and he killed her.

1531
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,160
No.

1532
02:19:50,460 --> 02:19:52,000
玛丽亚…
Maria.

1533
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:01,470
不会是玛丽亚
Not Maria, Doc.

1534
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:04,100
她是…
She's...

1535
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:13,440
奇诺！奇诺
Chino!

1536
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:18,530
出来找我，奇诺
Come and get me, too, Chino!

1537
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:23,160
奇诺

∮Hold my hand ∮ ∮And we're halfway there ∮

1568
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:05,490
牵着我的手 我带着你去
∮Hold my hand ∮ ∮And I'll take you there ∮

1569
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,530
用某种方式
∮Somehow ∮

1570
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:10,830
在某天
∮Someday ∮

1571
02:23:10,990 --> 02:23:12,660
某…
∮Some... ∮

1572
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:54,700
退后
Stay back!

1573
02:24:15,730 --> 02:24:18,690
奇诺，你怎么开枪的？
How do you fire this gun, Chino?

1574
02:24:18,850 --> 02:24:22,070
扣这小小的板机？
Just by pulling this little trigger?

1575
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:24,900
奇诺，还有几发子弹？
How many bullets are left, Chino?

1576
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,860
够杀了你？
Enough for you?

1577
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:28,410
还有你
And you?

1578
02:24:29,990 --> 02:24:31,320
你们全部
All of you!

1579
02:24:31,490 --> 02:24:35,700
你们都杀了他 还有我哥哥和芮夫
You all killed him, and my brother, and Riff...

1580
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:38,370
不是用子弹和枪
not with bullets and guns.

1581
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,540
而是用仇恨
With hate!

1582
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:45,010
现在我也能杀人了 因为我也有恨
I can kill, too, because now I have hate!

1583
02:24:45,170 --> 02:24:48,430
奇诺？我能杀几个？几个
How many can I kill, Chino? How many?

1584
02:24:48,590 --> 02:24:51,430
然后还能剩一发子弹给我自己
And still have one bullet left for me?

1585
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,600
不
No!

1586
02:25:13,240 --> 02:25:16,240
不要碰他
Don't you touch him!

1587
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:12,310
Te adoro, Anton.
