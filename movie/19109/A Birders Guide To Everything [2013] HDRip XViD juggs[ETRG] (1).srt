Actually, it looks like
we'll be in somers for good now.

Okay, well,

You're 15. It's okay.

It's not a big deal.
I've only kissed,

I should have prefaced
all this by saying--

we saw something flying
south a few hours ago,

01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,852

are you crazy?
Are you insane?

1061
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:05,454
[ Jeff ]
Go, go, go!

1062
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:06,855
Come on!
Get on! Get on!

1063
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,732
Holy shit!
Thrilling.

1064
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,135
So what now?

1065
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,771
What do you mean?
I don't know.

1066
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:24,840
Peter just stole
your friend's AT.V.,

1067
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:27,008
and you're trying to
steal our sighting.

1068
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,444
- just that.
- that's one way
of looking at it.

1069
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,747
Another way is to say
that we're four birders...

1070
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:35,016
Looking to find
an extinct duck, standing
on the brink of history.

1071
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:38,186
How do we know you're not
gonna steal the credit
for the sighting?

1072
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,531
Are we cool?

1073
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,100
Yes.

1074
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,839
Miguel forgot a tie.
You have one?

1075
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,541
He's not gonna want
one of my ties.

1076
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:01,777
Let me see
what david has.

1077
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,165
[ Sighs ]

1078
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,956
Don, I'm gonna need
the list for the--

1079
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,593
what the hell
is all this?

1080
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:56,131
I think I might be
an asshole, ted.

1081
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:04,873
[ Konrad ]
It's rare I go birding
with the younger generation.

1082
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:08,143
I had hoped that my daughter
would follow in my footsteps,

1083
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:11,179
but she and my ex-wife
detest me.

1084
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,984
Did you and your mother
bird together?

1085
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,386
Yes. A lot.

1086
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:21,623
She would have
adored this.

1087
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,159
You probably don't remember,
but back in the '90s,

1088
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:27,095
she discovered a new colony
of piping plovers.

1089
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:29,231
Piping plovers. I have
all the newspaper clippings.

1090
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,970
There's nothing like
the feeling of discovery.

1091
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:44,613
How's your father doing?
It must be difficult
for the two of you now.

1092
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:46,948
He's, uh,
he's getting married.

1093
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,485
I see.

1094
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,922
Yeah.
Well, everyone
copes differently.

1095
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:56,658
Yeah. And some people
are just dicks.

1096
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:03,365
Your father
is not a dick.

1097
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:06,101
I'm sorry,
but you don't know him.

1098
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:09,204
Well, I do, actually.

1099
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:12,073
He helped with archiving
dotty's research materials...

1100
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,075
At the magazine
after she died.

1101
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,345
What?

1102
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:20,548
Wait, wait, how?
How is that possible?

1103
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,620
Birds are my muses.

1104
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:31,326
And I strive to be
a true watcher.

1105
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:34,329
I can remember when I spotted my
first greater prairie chicken...

1106
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,197
But not
my own daughter's birthday.

1107
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:38,066
But you're already--

1108
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:40,635
I'm 63 years old
and very much alone.

1109
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:43,004
I guide assholes
for money.

1110
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:46,041
I have one leg
and no driver's license.

1111
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,543
Please do not confuse me
with a role model.

1112
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,318
Why don't you have
a driver's license?

1113
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,420
A bit of a mix-up...

1114
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:03,358
Between what I thought
was an albino nighthawk
and a high-speed police chase.

1115
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,631
[ Dotty ]
Get your binoculars out.

1116
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:12,600
Okay, keep looking.
Keep looking.
See if you see it.

1117
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,559
Remarkable.

1118
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,262
Yeah, it's empty
though.

1119
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:42,764
[ Exhales ]
Here goes nothin'.

1120

[ Quacking ]

1121

[ Duck quacking ]

1122
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:54,342
Was that it?
Maybe.
It was a little muffled.

1123
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,045
No, it was definitely
a greeting call.

1124
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:59,381
- [ David ]
I think that maybe it was--
- oh, my god!

1125
01:06:59,383 --> 01:07:02,384
That would be
a male mallard.
Oh.

1126
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:04,419
[ Quacking ]
[ David ]
Wait.

1127
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:06,454
Why did it answer
to a scoter call?

1128
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,657
Maybe it was raised
by scoters.

1129
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:12,193
It was not raised
by scoters, okay?

1130
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:19,100
[ David ] cross lake
is a few miles up. I think
maybe we should just go there.

1131
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:21,369
Why would it go
to the lake that's
farther from shore?

1132
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,239
It's not unheard of.
It's practically
unheard of.

1133
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,374
Guys?

1134
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,410
Is that your duck,

1135
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,186
Oh, my god.

What's it doing?

1137
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,558

Shh. It's preening.

1138

couldn't be better.

1139

It's a magnificent bird.

This isn't a labrador duck.
[ Timmy ] what?

1162
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:59,260
Its neck does decline strangely,
but I think what we have here...

1163
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:01,963
Is an oddly-plumaged
hybrid mallard.

1164
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:05,400
- look at the wing markings.
- see, the wing markings
always concerned me.

1165
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:07,202
Yep. It's definitely
an odd hybrid of sorts.

If it's okay with you guys,

for our banquet.

Banquet?
We're hunting
for our church banquet.

All the proceeds are going
to the save darfur foundation.
