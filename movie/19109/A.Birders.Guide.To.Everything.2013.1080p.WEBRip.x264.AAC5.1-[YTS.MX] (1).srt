TO GET A MOVE ON.

TO SEA DUCKS. SUCH AS EIDERS.

00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,529

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,923

00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,794

YOU'VE READ MY MEMOIR.

00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,531

PRECISELY WHY THIS PHOTO

350
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,359

MEMBERSHIP, AND THE THREE OF US

WHAT IS THIS? IS THAT
CRACK COCAINE?

568
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:00,059
I HAVE NO IDEA. MAYBE.

569
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:01,190
MAYBE?

570
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:04,150
JUST KEEP DRIVING PETER.
IT LOOKS LIKE...

IT'S ROCK CANDY.

573

THEY'RE CRYSTALS.

WHAT?

576
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:16,466
CRYSTAL METH.

577
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:17,467
THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW.

NO, PETER, THINK.

582
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:25,345
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE RETURN THE
CAR WITHOUT THE DRUGS, OK?

583
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:28,522
LIKE MAYBE ERIC WAS TRYING TO
SELL THEM ON BEHALF OF SOME DRUG

COME LOOKING FOR THE MONEY,

00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:33,483
SUDDENLY ERIC DOESN'T HAVE
THE MONEY OR THE DRUGS.

586
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,615
SO THEY KILL HIM.

YOU WORKING AT YOUR OWN WEDDING?

1424
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,898
RIGHT? IT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.

1425
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:14,161
YOU KNOW THERE'S A MILLION
PEOPLE TO TALK TO OUT THERE?

1426
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:17,817
I KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR HIRING ERIC I GUESS.

1427
01:15:17,948 --> 01:15:19,253
THAT IS WHAT YOU GET.

1428
01:15:31,918 --> 01:15:33,659
DAD.

1429
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,531
YEAH?

1430
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:42,363
WERE YOU SEEING JULIANA...

1431
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:45,889
BEFORE OR AFTER MOM?

1432
01:15:46,019 --> 01:15:47,847
DEFINITELY AFTER.

1433
01:15:52,112 --> 01:15:53,723
OK.

1434
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:04,647
YOUR MOTHER WAS THE
LOVE OF MY LIFE.

1435
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:09,173
YOU KNOW THAT.

1436
01:16:10,043 --> 01:16:11,567
NO, I DIDN'T.

1437
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:20,140
AH JESUS CHRIST.

1438
01:16:21,446 --> 01:16:22,969
DAVID, I'M SORRY I SHOULD
HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF

1439
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,189
EXPLAINING IT ALL.

1440
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:26,146
WE SPOKE ABOUT IT.

1441
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:27,365
NO WE DIDN'T.

1442
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:30,020
WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT
IT. NOT REALLY.

1443
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,891
WE DIDN'T.

1444
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:40,291
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

1445
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:41,858
IT'S LIKE YOU REMEMBER THAT-

1446
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:43,729
I JUST DON'T' WANT TO PRETEND
THAT WE DON'T MISS MOM.

1447
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:49,387
ME EITHER.

1448
01:16:55,045 --> 01:16:56,612
WANNA GRAB THAT CHICKEN?

1449
01:17:09,102 --> 01:17:10,190
...BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
WE WERE TERRORISTS.

1450
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:11,235
IT WAS AWFUL.

1451
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:12,410
HEY.

1452
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:13,890
EXCUSE ME.

1453
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,240
ARE YOU IN A BAND OR SOMETHING?

1454
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:17,894
EXCUSE ME?

1455
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:25,945
[MIC FEEDBACK]

1456
01:17:29,557 --> 01:17:30,950
HELLO?

1457
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:34,650
HEY.

1458
01:17:35,607 --> 01:17:37,174
HEY, EVERYONE.

1459
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:39,263
UM...

1460
01:17:39,393 --> 01:17:43,267
SO TECHNICALLY I'M
THE BEST MAN HERE,

1461
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:46,139
AND I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED
TO GIVE A TOAST.

1462
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:47,053
UM...

1463
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:52,972
WHERE DO I START?
THE THING IS...

1464
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:55,801
THE LAST COUPLE OF
DAYS I'VE BEEN LOOKING

1465
01:17:55,932 --> 01:17:58,195
FOR AN EXTINCT DUCK.

1466
01:17:58,325 --> 01:18:02,852
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE A
METAPHOR OR SOMETHING.

1467
01:18:02,982 --> 01:18:04,549
IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T EXTINCT.

1468
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,247
ACTUALLY IT WASN'T THE
DUCK I THOUGHT IT WAS.

1469
01:18:07,378 --> 01:18:09,685
AND IT GOT SHOT.

1470
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:13,384
BUT IN A WEIRD WAY IT TURNS
OUT IT MIGHT HELP THE WHOLE

1471
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:15,995
SITUATION GOING ON IN DARFUR.

1472
01:18:16,953 --> 01:18:20,783
SORRY, ANYWAY...

1473
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:24,351
I'M GLAD I MADE IT HERE.

1474
01:18:24,482 --> 01:18:26,266
TODAY.

1475
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:32,098
ALTHOUGH THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE
BEEN KINDA ROUGH FOR OUR FAMILY.

1476
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:34,797
UM...

1477
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:36,146
DAVID?

1478
01:18:36,276 --> 01:18:38,235
I KNOW, SORRY.

1479
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:39,410
DAD LIKES TO FILL
HOLES WITH LISTS.

1480
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:42,282
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

1481
01:18:42,413 --> 01:18:43,544
HE WRITES LISTS OF EVERYTHING.

1482
01:18:43,675 --> 01:18:46,591
LIKE LISTS OF LISTS.

1483
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,463
AND I LIKE TO FIND RARE BIRDS,
SO I'M NOT REALLY ONE TALK.

1484
01:18:49,594 --> 01:18:51,944
BUT IT DOESN'T...

1485
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:56,470
DOESN'T REALLY WORK,
WHICH IS WHY I AM SO GLAD

1486
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:59,604
HE FOUND JULIANA.

1487
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:04,087
BECAUSE I KNOW MY MOM
REALLY LIKED HER AND MY DAD

1488
01:19:04,217 --> 01:19:06,916
OBVIOUSLY LIKES HER TOO.

1489
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:10,876
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

1490
01:19:14,662 --> 01:19:16,490
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE
ALL HERE RIGHT.

1491
01:19:19,537 --> 01:19:21,278
SO...

1492
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:26,631
I WISH THEM A HAPPY
AND LONG LIFE TOGETHER.

1493
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,415
HERE'S TO DAD AND JULIANA.

1494
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:33,159
[APPLAUSE]

1495
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:42,342
YOU WERE PERFECT.

1496
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:06,889
SO, DOES ERIC KNOW THAT WE,
LIKE, DESTROYED HIS ENGINE?

1497
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:09,456
AH YOU KNOW...

1498
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:12,416
THE TIMING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.

1499
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:14,374
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY.

1500
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:15,636
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ERIC, ALRIGHT?

1501
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:17,377
I'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS
SHIT ON HIM THAT

1502
01:20:17,508 --> 01:20:18,857
I'VE BEEN SAVING FOR
A MOMENT LIKE THIS.

1503
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:21,164
GOT IT.

1504
01:20:21,294 --> 01:20:22,426
I THINK I'M GONNA HEAD HOME NOW.

1505
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:23,949
YEAH, ME TOO.

1506
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:26,865

1509
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:41,010

WAIT UNTIL I CALL KIM?

1510
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,402
WHAT?

1511
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:44,100
YOU GOT HER NUMBER?

1512
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:47,016
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT, DUDE?

1513
01:20:47,146 --> 01:20:48,626
I SHOULD GO TOO.

1514
01:20:48,756 --> 01:20:50,106
I GUESS.

1515
01:20:50,236 --> 01:20:53,892
SO, WEIRDLY ENOUGH I HAD
A LOT OF FUN THIS WEEKEND.

1516
01:20:54,023 --> 01:20:56,068
SO DID I.

1517
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:58,157
PETER GAVE ME HIS OLD PAIR.

1518

GOOD AS YOURS, BUT
