1
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,590
Awesome. Great use of your chin as a brake, honey.

2
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,430
Don't eat too much sand. You'll spoil your dinner.

3
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,890
- Look, it's Superman. - Superman!

4
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,690
It's the Man of Steel!

5
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,980
He's going to save us.

6
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,610
Whoo! Superman! Ha-ha-ha.

7
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,150
Wait, what is he saving us from? Lunch?

8
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,190
Yeah, it's a pretty nice day.

9
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,260
Bizarro save tiny people from tentacle creature.

10
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,900
Bizarro no like calamari.

11
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,730
- Aah! - My baby!

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,580
- Oh. - Mommy.

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,620
Don't worry. They're just fine.

14
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,920
But this one spit up a little sand when I caught him.

15
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,880
Thank you, Superman.

16
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,460
You saved my child from your crazy brother.

17
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,300
Oh, no. No, no, no.

18
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,550
That's not my brother.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,370
It... I mean, he, was created...

20
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,430
when Lex Luthor hit me with a duplicator ray...

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,470
to make a clone of me he could control.

22
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,770
Excuse me.

23
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,860
Bizarro, put that down.

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,490
Bizarro put down.

25
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,530
Down means up, up means down.

26
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,040
Why does everything have to be backwards with you?

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,500
Bizarro help Superman save Metropolis from tentacle creature.

28
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,050
Why is it every time you try to help, Metropolis ends up destroyed?

29
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,010
- That octopus isn't a creature. - Oh.

30
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,730
It isn't even an octopus. It's not dangerous.

31
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,590
Huh?

32
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,070
Ha-ha-ha. Boom.

33
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,700
My car! Do you know how long it took me to assemble?

34
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,070
There were, like, so many bricks.

35
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,910
Can you take your identical twin somewhere else?

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,490
Twins? Oh, no.

37
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,960
He's actually the opposite of me in every way.

38
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,470
Ha! Bizarro save Metropolis.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,090
Bizarro save home.

40
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,180
Hey, who's gonna pay for this?

41
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,640
Someone might have gotten hurt in all of this.

42
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,530
- You sure did. - This is ridiculous.

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,700
You know, I recently discovered a place that

44
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,690
needs your help even more than Metropolis.

45
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,820
Let's not go.

46
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,360
Follow me.

47
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,700
I mean, don't follow me.

48
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,300
Bizarro spy with his little eye, something start with letter S.

49
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,050
Space.

50
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,390
How Superman know?

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,980
Should be around...

52
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,730
Ah! Right there.

53
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,750
Pretty. Ha-ha-ha.

54
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,630
Ugh!

55
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,180
Ha-ha-ha. That tickled.

56
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,230
Where you take Bizarro?

57
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,350
Somewhere you can't get into trouble.

58
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,150
This planet's physics are a little backwards.

59
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,610
Just like you.

60
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,320
It's going to be the perfect home.

61
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,320
Home Metropolis.

62
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,870
How I save Daily Planet?

63
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,200
How I save people here?

64
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,160
Hmm...

65
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,160
Watch this.

66
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,430
The Daily Planet, just like the one on Earth. What do you think?

67
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,480
Uh...

68
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,600
Ah!

69
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,610
Bizarro, that citizen is in trouble.

70
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,700
Ha!

71
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,160
Ah!

72
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,500
Ha!

73
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,720
You nothing to worry for, citizen.

74
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,340
Bizarro keep safe.

75
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,510
Aah!

76
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,680
I think I kill him.

77
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,390
I think I kill him. Aah!

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
No, no, he'll be just fine.

79
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,230
He just needs to rest at home.

80
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,610
Wait, he needs a home.

81
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,650
Can you build him a home, Bizarro?

82
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,940
Uh, Bizarro build.

83
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,700
I'd wish you good luck, Bizarro, but I know you'd take it the wrong way.

84
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,730
- It's Giganta! - Run, run, run!

85
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,190
What is that thing?

86
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,570
Out of my way.

87
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,320
I don't wanna be pulling mini figs out of my toes.

88
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,120
The Daily Planet news building.

89
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,290
Well, I got news for you.

90
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,710
Print is dead.

91
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,480
This skyscraper is heavier than you think.

92
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,980
Now Clark Kent doesn't have to look for a new job.

93
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,330
By the Golden Girdle of Gaea, Giganta, this is no way for a lady to act.

94
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,830
Or dress. Animal prints are so last season.

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,880
Leopard spots are the new black.

96
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,340
And I'm gonna make you black and blue.

97
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,130
Get back here.

98
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,590
If you say so.

99
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,680
The perfect distraction for the perfect plan.

100
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,400
The Justice League will never figure out what I'm really up to.

101
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,160
Let me take a shot at it, Gorilla Grodd.

102
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,790
You use your mind control helmet to turn Giganta, Penguin...

103
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,170
Deathstroke and Captain Cold into henchmen.

104
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,990
So while Giganta wreaks havoc on Metropolis,

105
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,630
you go after your real prize.

106
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,760
Pretty good guess, and a lot of words on one breath.

107
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,520
- Ugh. - Booyah!

108
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Bats knew you'd try that, so he had me snatch your hypno-helmet.

109
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,980
He's just so smart.

110
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,120
Ugh!

111
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,590
Grodd had us under mind control.

112
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,970
We're stealing for you?

113
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,260
That's cold, man.

114
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,430
This heist better be for something good.

115
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
- Huh? - Aah!

116
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,970
Bananas?

117
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,980
Ha, ha. Bananas?

118
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,810
I like bananas? Ha-ha-ha.

119
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,520
Nobody makes a monkey out of me.

120
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,400
Let's get out of here.

121
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,580
They're getting away.

122
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,060
Relax, Cyborg. They won't get far.

123
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,850
Hawkman, Operation Crop Duster.

124
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Flash, I need you after Captain Cold.

125
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,440
I'm on it.

126
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,600
Green Arrow, see if you have anything

127
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,650
in your quiver to take down a flightless bird.

128
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,860
Copy that, Dark Knight.

129
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,160
Plastic Man, I need you to wrap up Deathstroke.

130
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,830
Roger Dodger, Caped Crusader.

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,290
Hawkman delivers.

132
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,170
Just my size.

133
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,130
Gotcha.

134
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,390
Stay put, rookie.

135
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,180
Wish I had a jetpack.

136
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,230
Man, do I have to do everything around here?

137
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,110
Let me show you how a real hero does it.

138
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,700
Say hello to my little friend who's really big, and it's me.

139
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,950
Wow, look, Superman...

140
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,200
Guy Gardner finally made something as big as his ego.

141
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,340
Say hello to the agony of the feet.

142
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,760
Ow.

143
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,430
Flash to Batman, I'm hot on the trail of Captain Cold.

144
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,230
Get it? Hot, cold, huh?

145
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,150
I don't like tailgaters.

146
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,310
Hmm.

147
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,200
All right.

148
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,620
Cool off in the icebox.

149
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,370
Ha-ha-ha.

150
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,540
My favorite time of year: Duck season.

151
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,640
Green Arrow to Batman.

152
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,430
This Penguin is poached.

153
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,770
Plastic Man versus Deathstroke? That's a stretch.

154
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,610
Whoo! That was close. Aah!

155
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,700
- Aah! - Oh.

156
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,080
Plas to Batman, I've got mine all wrapped up. Hee-haw!

157
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,050
Wrapping things up here too.

158
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,970
Superman to Batman.

159
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,970
How's it going with that big gorilla?

160
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,890
- Need any help? - I don't need any help from you.

161
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,520
Look, a monkey.

162
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,060
Thanks, Batman.

163
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,270
Hey, now, great takedown.

164
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,920
But, you know, maybe next time,

165
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,230
instead of using children to stop supervillains...

166
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,440
feel free to call on your friends.

167
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,990
I keep my friends close and my enemies closer.

168
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,870
I hope not much closer than this. Hey, you're not implying that...

169
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,680
Great work out there, everyone.

170
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,190
Especially our two new recruits: Cyborg and Guy.

171
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,270
The Man of Steel just said I did great. Fist bump.

172
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,480
I don't fist bump.

173
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,450
Just glad I was there to save Wonder Woman.

174
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,780
Was that before or after Giganta laid

175
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,370
you down for a nap, rookie?

176
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,530
- Hmm. - Whoa.

177
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,750
When we join forces, no evil can match us.

178
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,250
That's why we formed the Justice League.

179
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,000
Together we fight for the liberties of all living creatures, great and small.

180
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,510
I joined the league to keep an eye on the most powerful being on Earth.

181
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,220
The hearts and minds of man are no mystery to me.

182
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,850
But an alien Superman...

183
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,350
Good thing I have my "just in case" box of kryptonite.

184
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,150
I'm okay. Not sure what came over me there.

185
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,650
Must've eaten some bad buffalo wings.

186
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,210
Now, where was I?

187
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,740
Oh, yes, yes. Next order of business.

188
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,030
Flash is bored, again.

189
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,660
Any ideas on some new activities to keep him busy?

190
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,040
- Archery. - Ice sculpture.

191
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,710
North American duck calls?

192
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,380
- Ha, ha. - Huh?

193
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,300
Okay, what now? Ooh. Snack time.

194
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,640
- A hero sandwich sounds good. - Let's eat.

195
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,520
- Race you. - Birdseed burrito time.

196
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,270
Booyah!

197
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,810
Hmm. Superman sure left in a big hurry.

198
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,860
- Uh-oh. Trouble alert. - Great Hera.

199
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,490
There are reports of Superman attacking LexCorp in Metropolis?

200
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,830
Aha! I knew he would snap one day.

201
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,960
I tried to warn everyone, but no one would listen.

202
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,130
Uh...

203
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,340
We were just making sandwiches.

204
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,300
Don't think I won't check that alibi.

205
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,390
I have a pretty good idea of who's behind this.

206
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,810
Why don't I just take care of this one solo, guys?

207
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,100
I don't think so. Let's go.

208
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,860
What a mess.

209
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,320
I'd hate to be the guy who's responsible for this.

210
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,700
Yeah, really, guys, I've totally got this.

211
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,990
And miss all the action? Uh-uh.

212
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,180
Oh, look. Guns, guns, and more guns.

213
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,800
Is this a villain lair?

214
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,970
Oh, it's my first villain lair. Ha, ha.

215
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,900
It seems Lex has been busy plotting our demise.

216
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,650
Even Superman's.

217
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,820
Hmm. Mm-hm.

218
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,950
All right.

219
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,610
Okay.

220
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,410
Ah.

221
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,080
Hmm.

222
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,660
Lex may be onto something with this one.

223
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,160
And the directions are very easy to follow.

224
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,510
Ah, Batman,

225
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,340
leave it to you to dispose of Lex's evil plans for me.

226
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

227
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,590
Took you long enough.

228
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,800
My lab is practically destroyed.

229
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,890
Lex Luthor.

230
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,890
Do we really have to help this guy?

231
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,480
What's that supposed to mean?

232
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,100
Hello? Villain lair?

233
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,190
You spend all day creating weapons to destroy us.

234
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,440
Hades himself would spurn you, you treacherous snake.

235
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,110
How many times have you framed one of us for a crime...

236
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,950
and then run for president on a platform to stop us?

237
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,870
That reminds me.

238
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,660
Vote for Lex.

239
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,750
That's going to look great on posters. Now, stop him.

240
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,590
Bizarro.

241
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,680
Another alien.

242
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,850
Whoa.

243
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,680
Are you twins?

244
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,890
Heh, heh. We are not twins.

245
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,860
Great Scott, the LexCorp duplicator ray that created you.

246
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,700
You broke in here to steal it? But why?

247
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,030
- Bizarro show you. - Bizarro, don't!

248
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,130
Ugh!

249
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,900
I Batzarro. World's worst detective.

250
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,780
I Greenzarro. And I scared.

251
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,700
I...

252
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,910
Cyzarro.

253
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,330
I Bizarra. Pretty, pretty princess.

254
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,920
Bizarro, give me that ray before you do any more damage.

255
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,890
Nothing stop Bizarro.

256
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,300
Not even Superman.

257
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,230
Can we go? I scared.

258
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,400
Okay. Let's stay.

259
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,650
You heard Bizarro. Stay.

260
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,990
Hmm.

261
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,990
"B-O-M-B."

262
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,210
Boom.

263
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,640
That was weird.

264
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,020
Your twin brother was way out of line there, Superman.

265
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,790
The universe only needs one Guy Gardner.

266
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,100
If that.

267
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,820
How do we know this wasn't always part of your secret alien plan?

268
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,400
Because Bizarro can't keep secrets.

269
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,450
He can barely keep his pants up.

270
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,410
But why make duplicates of us?

271
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,660
Duplicates with terrible hair and unplucked eyebrows?

272
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,200
I don't know, but if one Bizarro can cause this much destruction...

273
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,710
think of what an entire Bizarro League could do.

274
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,040
And I think I know where they're going.

275
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,050
Bizarro World.

276
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,630
Let's go.

277
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,550
So you want us to follow you to some distant planet, huh?

278
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,220
Well, I'll play your little game for now, alien.

279
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,690
This is just great.

280
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,280
They destroy my lab and Bizarro takes the kryptonite bomb...

281
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,070
I was going to destroy Superman with.

282
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,950
Ow.

283
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,050
Merciful Minerva.

284
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,630
Bizarro's planet's a cube?

285
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,590
Figures.

286
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,970
I should warn you, things here behave a little...

287
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,770
Uh, Bizarro?

288
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,030
Ha! One Green Lantern rescue rocket coming up.

289
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,660
A chicken?

290
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,870
Why does that not surprise me?

291
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,210
Hey, at least I can still fly, Wonderless Woman.

292
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,760
Ugh!

293
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Chicken. How degrading.

294
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,390
Yeah, I call that use of power ring a clear "foul."

295
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,680
Get it? Fowl? Ha, ha.

296
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,310
This strange planet shows no evidence of animals or plants.

297
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,980
Well, there's a face-plant. Heh.

298
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,320
These rocks are emitting a weird form of radiation.

299
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,530
Ooh. We should call it weirdiation, then.

300
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,780
I like that name.

301
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,280
- It's this radiation... - I do not know what you are talking about.

302
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,910
Radiation? There are so many kinds.

303
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,000
If only there was a way to differentiate this particular...

304
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,540
Fine. It's this weirdiation that created the planet...

305
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,630
and is now interfering with the team's powers and equipment.

306
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,470
Equipment? That's what I'm made of.

307
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,840
Oh, there goes my arm.

308
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,710
Hey, why doesn't this place affect you?

309
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,300
Well, not much does, I guess.

310
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,100
So the Kryptonian has lured us to a planet...

311
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,520
that renders our powers and weapons useless...

312
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,650
while he remains unaffected.

313
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,820
Well, I have something that will affect him.

314
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,820
Hmm.

315
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,780
Shh. We're being watched.

316
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,200
What do you want?

317
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,830
I think he wants to know why you're talking to a rock.

318
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,500
It's a citizen.

319
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,580
A citizen?

320
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,260
I tried to make this place feel more like home for Bizarro.

321
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,300
But he seems to have taken it to another level.

322
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,350
It's a wacked-out Metropolis.

323
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,680
A Bizarrotropolis.

324
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,440
I like to make up funny names.

325
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,810
I hear something.

326
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,610
I'm going to investigate.

327
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,650
Not without me, you're not.

328
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,450
That looks like fun.

329
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,290
Oh, man.

330
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,870
Beautiful from up here, isn't it?

331
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,420
Oh, and unless you want us both to fall and become super pancakes...

332
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,380
I'd keep your lead box full of kryptonite closed tight...

333
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,380
Bruce Wayne. Ha, ha.

334
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,800
I knew you'd use your x-ray vision on me. But how did you see...

335
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,010
- through my lead-lined mask? - I can't.

336
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,100
But I can see that somebody stitched your

337
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,230
name onto the elastic band of your underwear.

338
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,270
Alfred.

339
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,810
Oh, come on.

340
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,020
You can trust me with your secret identity.

341
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,270
I'm Superman.

342
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,030
I don't trust anyone. Also, you're an invulnerable alien...

343
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,780
whose motives remain mysterious

344
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,030
which means I should especially not trust you...

345
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,740
Clark Kent.

346
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,290
Hey, how did you know my secret identity?

347
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,370
I'm Batman.

348
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,750
That's the source of the sound I heard earlier.

349
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,420
Darkseid.

350
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,850
Must save citizens from big head machine.

351
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,370
Oh, my doll.

352
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,600
Desaad, who is stealing my rocks?

353
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,680
Why, no one, Master Darkseid.

354
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,490
This is only a minor interference.

355
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,020
I'm taking care of it as we speak.

356
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,820
This heinous host of hideous heroes seems familiar.

357
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,110
No matter. Parademons, unleash the drones.

358
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,600
It tickle. It tickle.

359
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,900
- They're being tickled? - Tickled to death.

360
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,800
Aah! Superman?

361
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,550
Superman is here?

362
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,430
And Batman.

363
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,350
They have unexpectedly joined forces.

364
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Aah! Oh, they must know our plan.

365
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,880
I didn't say anything, I swear. I know I can

366
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,020
be a gossip, but they didn't hear it from me.

367
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,940
Unless my mother said something.

368
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,530
Crush them.

369
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,200
As you wish, my lord.

370
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,030
Crushing them as we speak.

371
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,370
Crush, crush, crush.

372
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,720
Yes! We've crushed them.

373
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,220
We've squished them.

374
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,220
Squished them into jelly, master.

375
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,810
Ooh, jelly. Maybe I could spread them on my toast.

376
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,770
Huh?

377
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,060
Where's my jelly?

378
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,150
Huh. Hmm.

379
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,540
Master Darkseid, the jelly...

380
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,570
I mean, the heroes have vanished.

381
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,240
Vaporized. Pulverized.

382
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,910
Atomized. Victimized.

383
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,740
We'll probably never see them again.

384
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,370
Probably. Maybe. Definitely?

385
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,040
Then there are more stones to collect.

386
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,290
Yes.

387
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,920
More stones, more stones, more stones.

388
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,150
- Ugh. - Hmm?

389
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,150
Good thinking. Creating a tunnel for us to escape into saved us all.

390
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,110
Was that a compliment?

391
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,740
Aah! No.

392
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,620
The alien clearly has some sort of mind control power I'm unaware of.

393
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,830
Must keep my wits about me.

394
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,170
Nice.

395
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,790
You managed to find these Bizarro knuckleheads on your own.

396
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,050
Man.

397
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,170
Ugh. Why does this planet keep tripping me up?

398
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,930
You am pretty, like Bizarra.

399
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,930
Ha! She is the spitting image of you, princess. Ha-ha-ha.

400
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,230
Hey. Who...?

401
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,980
You make good hiding place for Greenzarro.

402
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,900
Oh, boy.

403
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,240
Huh? Me am help you. Ha-ha-ha.

404
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,360
Thanks, I got it.

405
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,990
Now that we've found them, what are we gonna do with these Bizarros?

406
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,290
We're actually dealing with something much bigger than Superma...

407
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,870
I mean, Bizarro now.

408
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,080
Darkseid.

409
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,670
Darkseid?

410
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,630
I'm guessing that's a bad thing.

411
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,010
Oh, he's just the most dangerous force in the universe.

412
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,380
Yipe!

413
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,090
Is that why you stole the Bizarro ray and created your own league?

414
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,470
To stop Darkseid?

415
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,520
Bizarro wanted to protect his citizens from big head machine.

416
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,600
Big head machine already take many citizens.

417
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,820
You should have come to me first, Bizarro.

418
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,780
We can help you against Darkseid.

419
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,030
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

420
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,530
Easy for you to say, Mr. I've-Still-Got-My-Powers.

421
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,410
Are you sure you're not scared, Guy?

422
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,330
We're talking about rocks, princess.

423
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,330
Why risk our behinds for meaningless rocks?

424
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,920
Rocks my only friends after Superman send me away.

425
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,510
- I sent you here because... - Because you embarrassed by Bizarro.

426
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,510
So you hide him.

427
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,930
No, I...

428
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,260
They may just be rocks...

429
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,690
but I suspect Darkseid wants to harvest their unique properties for a weapon.

430
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,230
- Weirdiation. - Why make a weapon out of something...

431
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,900
that messes up everything it comes in contact with?

432
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,360
Because it messes up everything it comes in contact with.

433
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,570
Harnessing the power of this weirdiation...

434
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,240
could render Earth's defenses, it's heroes, useless.

435
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,540
Just like Guy.

436
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,000
Hey.

437
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,500
If Darkseid's after these rocks...

438
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,080
then he's headed to the greatest concentration of them:

439
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,630
Bizarrotropolis.

440
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,600
I have a plan. I'm going to reconstruct the blocks of these vehicles...

441
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,100
to create a thermodynamic amplifier of the Bizarro ray.

442
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,610
When fired at Darkseid's weirdiation supply,

443
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,820
it will create a new opposite form of matter...

444
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,900
and the two will annihilate each other, destroying his ship.

445
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,110
That make no sense.

446
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,830
All I hear is, "Blah, blah, blah...

447
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,450
science, blah, big word."

448
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,830
I have better plan.

449
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,250
First, we take nap.

450
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,630
Yay! Nap.

451
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,590
I think we should go with Batman's plan.

452
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,770
Thank you for meeting Bizarro for talk in his special place.

453
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,850
You am excellent listener.

454
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,610
Bizarro not feel helpful to Justice League.

455
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,610
- Bizarro not helpful to anyone. - Ahem.

456
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,610
Huh?

457
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,570
- Something bothering you? - On Earth, I bad hero...

458
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,870
on Bizarro world, I bad hero.

459
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,370
All I want is save day like Superman.

460
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,210
Oh. Oh, uh... Ugh.

461
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,880
Sorry.

462
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,420
Uh. Aw.

463
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,590
The Justice League will save the day, Bizarro. I promise.

464
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,970
No.

465
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,770
Bizarro save day.

466
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,190
Darkseid.

467
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,240
We've got to buy Batman some time. Let's go.

468
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,200
Ha, ha. This is gonna make you laugh.

469
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:06,080
Superman apparently was not crushed when we were doing all that crushing.

470
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,910
Neither was anyone else.

471
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,210
Please don't hurt me.

472
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,800
I will deal with them myself.

473
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,740
By Athena's gray eyes, she is a dog of war.

474
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,870
Then why is my guy such a pussycat?

475
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,500
Why can't you be more like her?

476
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,880
Come on. You can do it.

477
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,340
I believe in you. You're a Lantern.

478
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,890
Ha!

479
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,180
Still not working.

480
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,350
No!

481
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,190
That's what I'm talking about.

482
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,320
They better watch out for Darkseid's Omega Beams.

483
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,700
What are Omega Beams?

484
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,830
Those are Omega Beams.

485
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,170
Got it.

486
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,220
Superman, we meet again.

487
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:56,610
You know, Darkseid, my mother used to say:

488
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,780
"Heroes get the cake and bullies get the rake."

489
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,530
I'm still not entirely sure what that all meant...

490
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,840
but we'll never let you harness the power of this planet,

491
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,740
you space bully.

492
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,080
I will.

493
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:15,960
And after Earth falls, the entire universe will bow to me.

494
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,800
I don't think so.

495
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,340
Oh, the cape. Oh, the face.

496
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,560
I need more time, Superman.

497
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,520
Time?

498
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,230
Time is now purple o'clock. Heh, heh.

499
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,000
I can break for you.

500
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,540
That's what we're worried about.

501
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,080
Aah.

502
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,840
Go, Cyzarro, break now.

503
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,850
He did it.

504
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,150
He fixed it.

505
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:22,230
Of course. Only a Bizarro can make technology work here.

506
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,110
Take this.

507
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,570
- Ugh! - And this.

508
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,700
- And one of these too. - Ugh.

509
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,120
Uh-oh.

510
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,160
Ugh! Not fun.

511
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,420
You're too late, Superman.

512
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,590
I now have enough of this bizarre energy to rule the galaxy.

513
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,970
Well, on Bizarro World, rules are meant to be broken.

514
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:01,190
Bizarro save day.

515
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,400
Bizarro, stop!

516
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,840
A kryptonite bomb.

517
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,010
Thank you.

518
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,810
Desaad, let us test our weapon on Earth.

519
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,560
Hawkman and hawk jet, inbound.

520
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,100
Deploying hawk swords.

521
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,230
Pressing hawk button.

522
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,110
Hawk shield deployed.

523
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,190
Hawkman, did you intercept the ray?

524
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,960
You could say that.

525
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,260
Hawkman is holding off the ray...

526
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,470
but I suspect even his armor will eventually fall to the weirdiation.

527
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,730
Bizarro tried to help.

528
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,730
Yeah, you helped, all right. You helped Darkseid.

529
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,480
Thanks to you, we're done. Earth is toast.

530
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,690
Without Superman, we can't stop him.

531
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,320
Yes. Yes, you can.

532
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,950
Darkseid's ship is somehow being protected from the weirdiation.

533
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,160
But if we overload the ship with those crazy rocks...

534
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,720
Huh?

535
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,670
But that'll just make his weapon stronger.

536
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:29,050
So this is how you destroy us all.

537
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,170
You need to trust me, Batman.

538
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,720
Trust you?

539
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:48,170
Well, if there's one place I can try trusting you,

540
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,900
it's on a backwards world.

541
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,610
No. Those are Bizarro's people.

542
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,410
His friends.

543
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,280
I know, Bizarro, but you have new friends now.

544
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,790
Huh? Ah.

545
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,370
- Heh. - And an old one too.

546
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,630
Superman Bizarro's friend?

547
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,710
Not just friends, Bizarro.

548
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,010
Brothers. And I should've been a better one to you.

549
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,760
Twin brothers?

550
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:20,390
Fraternal, but, yes, twin.

551
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,320
Goodbye. Bizarro miss you.

552
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,800
I miss you.

553
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:01,760
Especially you with pointy head.

554
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,100
What are they doing?

555
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,690
They're overloading the system.

556
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,570
Goodbye, special place.

557
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,010
We lose. Heh, heh.

558
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,010
Activate the boom tube.

559
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,680
Yes, sire!

560
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,070
Must keep pressing button.

561
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,900
So hard.

562
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,410
Huh?

563
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Uh...

564
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,920
How attached are Earthlings to a round moon?

565
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,630
Superman A-okay.

566
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,300
That's great.

567
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,180
He's gonna be all right, then?

568
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,560
No. Batzarro means we can't save him.

569
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,100
Goodbye, Kal.

570
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,480
Gonna miss you, pal.

571
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,940
Wish I could've learned more from you.

572
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,520
Superman live.

573
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,480
Stop with the opposite talk, man.

574
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,360
No. Superman live.

575
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,250
He's drawing the kryptonite radiation from his body.

576
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,920
And because he's Bizarro, it doesn't affect him.

577
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,110
You saved the day, Bizarro.

578
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,610
- Bad job. - Terrible work.

579
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,990
You're a loser. Heh.

580
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,620
Thanks.

581
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,080
- You had me scared for a second, buddy. - Scared?

582
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,290
Knew it.

583
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,380
Booyah! Darkseid on the run and the Earth is safe.

584
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,170
Justice League does it again.

585
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,920
Fist bump.

586
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,510
I'm not wrong often, but I was about you.

587
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,390
You can be trusted.

588
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,430
Really? Wow.

589
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Then I guess you won't need that box of kryptonite anymore.

590
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,310
Let's not go crazy.

591
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
If we're gonna have a wild card on the team...

592
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,730
who can't stop keeping tabs on me, I'm glad it's you.

593
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,700
Whoa. Look at this place.

594
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,370
Bizarro lost whole world.

595
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:11,620
Then we're just gonna have to rebuild it together.

596
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,010
Hmm, great job.

597
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,180
In fact, the whole place looks wonderful.

598
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,470
I can't wait to walk through that front door.

599
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,100
Hmm. Front door.

600
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:49,530
So the heroes managed to survive Bizarro World. Hooray.

601
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,740
But even the mighty Justice League cannot hope to survive...

602
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,290
Operation Doom.
