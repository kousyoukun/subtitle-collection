It also means my first year
as Queen of Aldovia

our revised new Aldovia initiative
continued to grow.

17
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,959
And that's how we'll fund the tech center.

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,044
And the new hospital.

You've updated Aldovia's line
of succession to include females.

Does that mean it's a girl?

43

It means that we are hoping
to bring Aldovia

Well, I'd be delighted to finally know

or Claude for a boy.

Well, if it is a boy, I won't be offended
if you decided to name him Simon,

68
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,425
or Simone for a girl, obviously.

69

00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,154
No, you're far more valuable.

178
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,991
I want you both to have the best
of everything, including sleigh rides.

179
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,075
I've been thinking,

180
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,037
and I want this baby
to have a normal life,

181
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,121
as normal as possible.

182
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,290
Our child will be heir to the Kingdom.

183
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,418
Still, I went to public school,
I played with neighborhood kids.

184
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,128
I went to boarding school and played polo.

185
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,673
I was riding a subway by myself
when I was ten, and I ate diner food.

186
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,176
I had nannies
to make sure I ate my vegetables.

187
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,345
-I turned out all right.
-So did I.

188
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,556
We'll find a new definition
of normal together.

189
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,683
-No boarding school.
-No boarding school.

190
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,186
[inhales] But no subway riding, either.

191
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,898
Well, luckily for you,
Aldovia doesn't have a subway.

192
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,193
[whimsical instrumentals continue]

193
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,124
Your Majesties,

194
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,461
with an eye to the Penglians'
official visit and treaty signing

195
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,339
proceeding as smoothly as possible,

196
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,925
we feel a review is prudent.

197
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,969
Thank you for making the time.

198
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,014
Well, this is the last of the time
you will get of our Queen,

199
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,893
for the rest of the year
will be dedicated exclusively

200
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,438
to the preparations for the birth
of the royal baby.

201
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,107
Of course.

202
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,817
Mr. Little.

203
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,319
The centennial treaty

204
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,615
renews an ancient truce
between Aldovia and Penglia

205
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:38,119
that dates back to a war 600 years ago.

206
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,997
That was the war
over Silk Road trading routes, right?

207
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,249
You've studied your history, Queen Amber.

208
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,167
-[whooshing]
-[royal trumpeting]

209
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,338
[Mr. Little]  It was a fearsome
and brutal war with no end in sight.

210
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,801
-[mellow flute instrumentals]
- Finally, on Christmas Eve 1419,

211
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,388
Prince Claude of Aldovia
and Prince Jun of Penglia,

212
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,724
inspired by the season of peace
and goodwill,

213
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,560
found a way to end the conflict.

214
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,735
Just before midnight,

215
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,488
on that fateful Christmas Eve 1419,

216
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,117
the truce was declared
and the treaty signed.

217
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,205
[whooshing]

218
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,499
[paper rustling]

219
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,543
The treaty, your Majesties.

220
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,796
To honor the peace and friendship
between our nations,

221
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,758
the treaty has been ceremonially renewed

222
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,552
every 100 years since, without fail.

223
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,430
-[mellow flute instrumentals continue]
-The artistry is incredible.

224
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,098
[Richard] It's a treasured artifact.

225
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,477
It's been under our protection since 1919.

226
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,104
And after the signing,
it goes back to Penglia

227
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,314
for the next hundred years.

228
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,484
It's beautiful,
with the signatures of every king.

229
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,445
[inhales] I'll be the first queen
to sign it.

230
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,613
You will, indeed.

231
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,948
As long as the royals from Penglia agree.

232
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,870
[stammers] Whilst Aldovia boldly plunges
into the 21st Century,

233
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,874
this treaty dates back
to the 15th Century.

234
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,918
We'll have to proceed
very carefully, Amber.

235
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,712
The Penglians are our closest allies but,

236
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,632
in many respects,
they are quite traditional.

237
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,093
-[Amber chuckles]
-An attitude personified

238
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,887
by the Queen of Penglia, Queen Ming.

239
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,472
Compared to Queen Ming,

240
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,059
even Mrs. Averill
comes off as rather carefree.

241
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:25,976
[chuckling]

242
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,853
[Mrs. Averill] I have my carefree moments.

243
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,189
I had one last Sunday. [chuckles]

244
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,693
I love a challenge.
I can't wait to meet Queen Ming.

245
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,070
[booming drums]

246
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,073
[hollow tap]

247
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,493
[majestic instrumentals]

248
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,259
[siren blaring]

249
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,138
[tires treading water]

250
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,143
They shall be here momentarily.

251
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,729
[Mrs. Averill] Now come on, everybody.
Move into place, quickly.

252
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,652
[whoosh of cars]

253
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,031
[indistinct chatter]

254
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,414
[royal horn salute]

255
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:30,875
[indistinct chatter]

256
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,793
[cars approaching]

257
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,555
[engine idles]

258
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,477
Once they exit, meet them in the center.
King Richard will give a formal greeting.

259
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,649
[triumphant instrumentals]

260
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,022
[triumphant instrumentals fading]

261
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,071
Welcome to Aldovia.

262
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,572
-[crowd gasps]
-[Amber chuckles]

263
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,324
[throats clearing]

264
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,285
A most hearty welcome.

265
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:53,415
We're here to celebrate a hand clasp
on a battlefield 600 years ago.

266
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,043
That changed the fate of both our nations.

267
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,254
[sighs of relief]

268
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,005
-[cameras shutter]
-[chuckles] King Richard,

269
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,674
so glad to finally meet you in person.

270
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,259
Good to see you too, King Tai.

271
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,469
May I introduce my wife, Queen Amber.

272
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,639
An honor.
You're as lovely and charming as they say.

273
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,183
My wife, Queen Ming of Penglia.

274
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,561
-Queen Ming.
-I'm most pleased to be here.

275
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,940
And to finally lay eyes
on the famous Queen Amber of New York.

276
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,527
Wonderful to meet you, Queen Ming.

277
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,903
And you.

278
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,114
I'm Amber, hi.

279
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,491
Lynn is our attaché.

280
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,118
Oh.

281
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,536
Lynn?

282
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,162
Fantastic!

283
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,622
[playful instrumentals]

284
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,375
[Simon laughs]

285
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,299
[fanciful instrumentals]

286
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,385
[indistinct conversations]

287
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,347
[Mrs. Averill chuckles]

288
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,277
[indistinct chatter]

289
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,158
Beautiful.

290
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,119
No one does Christmas
like the Aldovians.

291
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,038
Thank you. We do our best.

292
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,707
If Emily had her way,
we'd have a tree in every room.

293
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,542
Actually, I believe you do.

294
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,710
Indeed, Tom.

295
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,296
-We have quite a bit of mistletoe too.
-[Tom gulps]

296
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,341
[Simon, laughing] That's spectacular.

297
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,134
[Lynn, Melissa laughing]

298
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,136
So, how do you two know each other?

299
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,846
We studied together, Oxford.

300
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,391
I studied. Simon... caroused.

301
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,226
I may have enjoyed
the occasional night out,

302
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,728
but I'm not the one whose picture...

303
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,897
-Hey, hey, hey!
-...is hanging in the King's Arms Pub.

304
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,107
-[Lynn and Simon laugh]
-[glasses clink]

305
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,525
[Lynn and Simon steadily exhale]

306
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,818
[Lynn chuckles]

307
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,029
[man] Red for you, your Highness.

308
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,323
And sparkling water for you, Your Majesty.

309
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,658
Thank you, Mr Zabala.

310
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,827
It appears you've adapted comfortably
to your new role.

311
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,204
I like to think so.

312
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,331
Not to say
there haven't been growing pains.

313
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,292
What with the Belgravians here,
in Aldovia, as well,

314
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,462
it seems royals
marrying outside of noble classes

315
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,005
has become quite fashionable.

316
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,091
And now your first child

317
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,218
-on the way. Congratulations.
-[Amber chuckles]

318
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,303
Providing your kingdom with an heir

319
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,973
is historically a Queen's utmost duty.

320
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,684
[stammers] Oh, I don't see it
as a duty at all.

321
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,478
Richard and I are simply excited
to start our family.

322
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,897
You have three children of your own?

323
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,818
Yes. Harry is 13.
Vivian and Amanda are ten.

324
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,654
Twins? I can't even imagine. [laughs]

325
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,030
[Amber inhales]

326
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,953
I have to admit, I was excited
to finally meet the playboy prince.

327
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,913
-[Richard chuckles]
-I enjoyed living vicariously

328
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,832
through your exploits in the press.

329
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,500
It's all greatly exaggerated.

330
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,128
I was actually hoping to talk
some business with you.

331
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,839
Business? Quite honestly,

332
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,383
I prefer to leave that tedium to Lynn.

333
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,676
[glasses clink]

334
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,763
Congratulations on your new position,
very impressive.

335
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,266
It's a start,
but I soon hope to be accomplishing more.

336
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,018
Ambitious as ever. [playfully scoffs]

337
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,352
What's your role at the palace?

338
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,313
Cousin to the King,
but you know me, working the angles.

339
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,065
-Oh, you always do. [laughs]
-[Simon laughs]

340
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,151
[phone ringing]

341
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,695
[scoffs] Pardon me, got to take this.
Angles of my own.

342
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,655
[Richard] Mm... [chuckles]

343
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,615
[inhales] She's a live wire.

344
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,451
Enjoying yourself?

345
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,287
-[stammers] Of course, yeah.
-[Richard exhales in relief]

346
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,042
Are you familiar
with Aldovia's modernization efforts?

347
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,754
I'm familiar
with all aspects of Aldovia's policy.

348
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,132
Given its success,
I spoke with Richard and

349
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,178
we feel that you and I
should add our signatures to the treaty.

350
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,599
You wish to modernize
our 600 year old tradition?

351
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,727
We, the Queens,
could bring the tradition up to date.

352
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,564
History isn't made
by those who follow rules.

353
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,067
[Mr. Little] Your Majesties.

354
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,944
May I announce the arrival of the CEO

355
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,490
and the Chief Designer
from S & A Events International.

356
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,824
[curious instrumentals]

357
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,415
-Your Majesties.
-It's a pleasure to be here.

358
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,167
Andy, hi!

359
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,835
Sahil!

360
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,504
[Andy] Wow, look at you.

361
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,464
You've never looked more beautiful.

362
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,590
[Amber exhales]

363
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,510
So this is what you've been doing?
Your secret project?

364
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,555
Consider Andrew and myself
early Christmas gifts.

365
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,809
Weddings were too small a niche
for such a big talent.

366
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,311
We rebranded
and expanded Sahil's business.

367
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,980
I was happy
to give Andrew the opportunity.

368
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,025
Design genius meets management expertise.

369
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,237
Mrs. Averill engaged us
to make sure that you had

370
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,406
the most spectacular
royal baby shower of all time.

371
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,118
-You deserve it.
-Thanks.

372
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,163
May I also offer our service,
free of charge,

373
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,291
to the elevation
of tomorrow's treaty signing?

374
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,459
Elevation?

375
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,588
I have seen the artifact.
It's a bit tacky, no? [laughs]

376
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,383
It's a priceless work of art.

377
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,679
We will be standing by if you need us.

378
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,805
[Amber chuckles]

379
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:00,889
Great.

380
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,602
[wind whirring]

381
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,146
[Amber] Next question.

382
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,274
During labor I would like
to spend the first stage

383
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:14,069
lying down, standing up, walking around,
in the shower or in the tub?

384
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,154
Lying down.

385
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,614
Walking around. New York, born and raised.

386
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,242
Never realized labour
came in multiple choice.

387
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,160
[button clicks]

388
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,369
[page rustling]

389
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,872
Testing. Testing. Can you hear me?

390
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,999
I can hear you.

391
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,793
Let's test it for real.

392
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,631
[Richard mimics the whoosh
of a flying plane]

393
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,091
Extraordinary.

394
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,302
-Are you seeing this?
-Yeah.

395
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,595
[playful instrumentals]

396
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,513
[Richard]  Whoa...

397
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,308
-[Amber sighs in frustration]
-Can you still see me?

398
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,268
-[Amber chuckles]
-Amber, hello?

399
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,769
This is unbelievable.

400
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,147
You're right. This  is  amazing.

401
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,191
Should we try from the nursery?

402
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,819
Now transmitting from the nursery.

403
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,946
-Can you hear me?
-[Amber playful groans over monitor]

404
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,282
-Amber, hello? Are you there?
-[whimpering over monitor]

405
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,533
I need a little help.

406
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,453
-Is that crying? Amber?
-[whimpering continues]

407
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,663
[Amber laughs, inhales sharply]

408
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,624
-[exhales]
-What is it?

409
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,792
I can't even reach my own slippers.

410
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,920
[peaceful instrumentals]

411
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,632
Allow me.

412
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,389
Perfect fit.

413
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,392
Cinderella was a bit more graceful.

414
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,728
But nowhere near as beautiful.

415
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,230
[swelling instrumentals]

416
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,817
[kissing sound]

417
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,904
-[Amber sighs]
-[wind whipping in distance]

418
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,989
[dramatic instrumentals]

419
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,867
[wind whirring]

420
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,877
[faint whirring wind]

421
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,337
[door creaks open]

422
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,798
[curious instrumentals]

423
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,468
-[door creaks closed]
-[ominous instrumentals]

424
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,225
[blissful instrumentals]

425
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,526
[Queen Ming]
This storm could spell disaster.

426
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,072
Where's Lynn?
I asked for an update four minutes ago.

427
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,950
Apologies, Queen Ming.
I was speaking to the pilot.

428
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,118
And?

429
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,995
The storm brought the country
to a standstill.

430
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,746
All flights have been canceled.

431
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,708
How would this affect the treaty signing?

432
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,127
The Aldovians wish to proceed
the ceremony as scheduled.

433
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,753
I agree.

434
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,171
Very well.

435
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,590
Find us a way home directly afterwards.

436
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,010
Our children expect us back.

437
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,011
Yes.

438
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,514
[majestic instrumentals]

439
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,022
[Queen Helena] Such a shame
there are so few guests

440
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,565
to witness this beautiful event.

441
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,280
Yes, I'm afraid no one's been able
to travel anywhere today, Your Majesty.

442
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,452
Your Majesties.

443
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,955
As expected, the Penglians
have officially rejected

444
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,333
-either queen signing the treaty.
-[Richard inhales deeply]

445
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,461
[exhales slowly] I'm sorry.

446
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,130
In a few minutes, this will all be over

447
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,257
and then we can focus
on what's most important.

448
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,884
You and the baby.

449
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,512
There's a little too much red.

450
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,890
I think they can do
with a little bit more blue,

451
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,974
-to be honest.
-Yeah.

452
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,642
[Sahil] I'm thinking royal blue.

453
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,770
Mm... Yeah. Could work.

454
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,440
In honor of the sacred treaty,

455
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:43,528
signed on the battlefield
on Christmas Eve in the year 1419,

456
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,280
the monarchy of Aldovia

457
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,201
welcomes King Tai
and Queen Ming of Penglia.

458
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,536
[royal procession music playing]

459
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,713
No. No, no, no.

460
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,931
It is my great honor and privilege

461
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:16,144
to preside over the seventh signing
of the sacred truce between our realms.

462
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,855
The entire Kingdom of Aldovia

463
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,275
heartily embraces our alliance
with Penglia.

464
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,862
What began as a handshake on Christmas Eve

465
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,157
has evolved into an ever-growing bond

466
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:33,703
represented by our invaluable,
ever-expanding

467
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,288
precious treaty.

468
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,292
Mr. Little, let the signing begin.

469
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,546
[royal salute instrumentals]

470
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,473
[drum roll]

471
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,059
-[booming effect]
-[gasping]

472
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,519
[suspenseful instrumentals]

473
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,904
How is this possible?

474
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,365
Where's the treaty?
It's supposed to be there.

475
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,658
[curious instrumentals]

476
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:12,993
We do apologize.

477
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,121
I'm sure we can get this little mix-up
straightened out right away.

478
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,582
Well this is certainly embarrassing.

479
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,920
If we don't sort this out,
we'll all end up in the dungeon.

480
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,297
Indeed.

481
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,967
Perhaps now it can be replaced
with something more palatable.

482
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,012
There must be an explanation.

483
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,763
Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

484
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,974
The treaty was there last night
when we checked.

485
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,976
-I can confirm.
-And now it's vanished.

486
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,605
I've been saying that we should update
the security protocols ever since...

487
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,566
well, you infiltrated the palace.

488
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,194
But no one has come or gone
since the blizzard.

489
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,279
So the treaty must still be in the palace.

490
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,822
Along with whoever took it.

491
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,618
-[hushed] What do we do now?
-[hushed] I don't know--

492
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,535
[Richard] Simon.

493
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,539
[sighs] We need your help.

494
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,874
You're kidding.

495
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,170
Well, I'd be delighted.
What can I do for my king and queen?

496
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,881
Find a way to occupy our guests
while we locate the treaty.

497
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,468
[hushed] It's okay, we'll make sure--
I'll make sure everything's sorted.

498
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,802
And how am I to do that?

499
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,305
You're friends with Lynn.
Keep them entertained.

500
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,015
Lynn's easy to entertain.

501
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,892
Not so sure about the others.

502
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,727
[hushed] One thing is for certain.

503
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,773
Just stick with Simon and make sure
he doesn't do anything Simon-like.

504
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,274
I'll be your eyes and ears.

505
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,986
I know what might be a bit of fun.

506
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,905
[cheery instrumentals]

507
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,823
[Christmas bells jingle]

508
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,537
[tree thuds]

509
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,580
Is this some kind of game?

510
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,000
Top of the tree,
a classic Aldovian Christmas game.

511
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,212
Wow, I haven't played this
since I was a kid. [chuckles]

512
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,630
Shockingly good idea, Simon.

513
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,257
Two teams compete,

514
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,552
the goal being
to decorate your side of the tree first.

515
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,304
The team that places the star
on top of the tree wins.

516
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,058
You want us to play a children's game
in the midst of this scandal?

517
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:04,229
Well, it's an unfortunate delay,
it's not really a scandal, yet.

518
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,815
Simon has a great talent for games.

519
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,151
-He's definitely talented at many things.
-[Simon laughs uneasily]

520
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,613
Ornaments are awarded
for answering questions

521
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,700
about famous royal traditions and legends.

522
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,993
Count me in.

523
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,745
Our children would enjoy this.

524
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,998
I'll go and inform them about the delay.

525
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:23,957
Of course.

526
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,960
It's a pity though,
we should have even teams.

527
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,962
Well, I'm happy to sit out if it helps.

528
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,591
I'm not exactly a whiz
at royal traditions yet.

529
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,219
I'll join King Tai.
I embrace any opportunity to beat Simon.

-I like your spirit, Princess.

you and me. [chuckles]

[Richard playfully scoffs]

534
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,151
-Would you like to start?
-Yes, please.

535
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,236
Any luck?

536
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,363
Not yet. [sighs]

537
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,574
We know the treaty was here last night.

538
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,784
We know that nobody's entered
or left the palace.

539
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,578
Are you proposing
we make a list of suspects?

540
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,747
Investigative journalism 101.

541
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,166
The treaty didn't fly away on its own.

542
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,835
Did you notice the look
that Simon and Lynn exchanged

543
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,086
when the treaty went missing?

544
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,214
And Sahil called it tacky.
I wouldn't put it past him.

545
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,344
Who in this palace had the means,
the opportunity, the motive?

546
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,512
-Did you take it?
-No.

547
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,890
Neither did I. That's two down.

548
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:22,974

[scoffs] This is an easy one.

Do you see that, Melissa, what she made?
It's amazing.

561
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,712
I can make you one.

562
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,632
Actually, I need to get some air.

Wait!

565
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,515
We should probably check on Ming.

566
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,267
A pity, Princess Emily, we would have won.

567
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,019
Sorry.

Final question.

571
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,993
Who was Aldovia's greatest king
and father?

572
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,287
That isn't a real question.

573
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,665
But you know the answer.

574
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,834
My father.

[Mr. Little exhales]

576
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,086

You win.

Will you do the honors?

Where are you going?

584
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,193
Simon and I need some alone time.

585
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,654
Melissa suggested a walk in the snow.

586
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,072
What about the Penglians?

587
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,452
Well Emily's more than capable
and my priority is Melissa.

588
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,787
Mel, can we talk a sec?

589
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,038
Yeah, sure.

590
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,915

Well, you and Simon, for one thing.

I never realized you were so close.

597
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,053
We talk for hours every night.

598
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,097
He's really smart,

599
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,893
funny, super cute
and really misunderstood.

600
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,227
Misunderstood?

601
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,230
Mel, all your bad boys
have left you heartbroken.

602
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,149
He's more than just a bad boy.

603
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,484
He cares about me.

604
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,028
It's starting to feel real, you know?

605
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,530
We are just worried about his intentions.

606
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,324
Have you seen the way he looks at Lynn?

607
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,868
He swears Lynn is just a friend.

608
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,746
I don't know,
sometimes I get a little insecure,

609

out of my depth with royals, you get that.

610
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, but you don't know Simon like we do.

Has the treaty been found?

623
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,618
It pains me to say no, Your Majesty.

624
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,787
After our initial survey,

625
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,498
we can assume it's nowhere obvious.

626
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,459
Your Majesty, please, be assured

627
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,962
no one will rest until it's located.

628
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,129
Thank you.

629
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,966
Because, according to the treaty's terms,

630
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,219
if it's not renewed by midnight
on Christmas Eve,

631
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,639
Aldovia and Penglia
technically return to a state of war.

632
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,434
Should be interesting,
as neither country has a standing army.

633
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,436
Emily, I thought you were with our guests.

634
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,982
Simon had to end the game abruptly.
They've returned to their rooms.

Please, continue to search.

Your Majesty.

638
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,745
Is this about the treaty?

639
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,164
Mother, did you read this?

640
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,418
"If there comes a day
the sacred truce is broken,

641
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,045
the Kingdom disrupting the peace
shall suffer a dreadful fate:

642
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,007
upon the firstborn a beshrew."

643
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,842
What's a beshrew?

644
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,719
[scoffs] It's a curse.

645
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,388
People believed in things like that
back then.

646
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,015
How did it work?

647
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,268
A sorceress would conjure a spell

648
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,854
to ensure
that the two kingdoms upheld the treaty.

649
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,565
So, if we don't sign the treaty
by Christmas Eve,

650
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,485
there'll be a curse
on the firstborn child?

Sorcery fell out of favor centuries ago.

654
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,371
Emily, we're not going to bother anyone
with this nonsense.

655
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,915
But what if it isn't nonsense?

No idea, but she thinks
he's a great guy, says they're in love.

Love is blind.

665

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,089
-[stammering] No, I was just--
-Just...

701
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,759
[sighs] Helping with the search.

702
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,845
Sahil called the treaty tacky.

703
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,805
I went too far. Don't be mad at me.

704
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,973
[laughs] Mad?

705
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,392
Look, I work with the guy daily.

706
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,186
I get it. He's opinionated.

707
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,855
It was a lead. We follow leads, remember?

708
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,025
I do, it's just we have
a multi-million dollar business now

709
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,276
and Sahil would never risk it.

710
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,487
Multi-million dollars, really?

711
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,655
Yeah. So if you wanna write a story,
write about us.

712
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,949
-Like a puff piece?
-Exactly.

713
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:37,867
[Amber chuckles]

714
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,660
-After the baby, of course.
-Of course.

715
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,703
[Andy laughs]

716
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,622
[playful instrumentals]

717
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,583
[exhales] Tell me you had success.

718
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,961
Thanks to your little ruse,
the last hour's felt like a month.

719
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,714
-Once Sahil gets in the zone--
-He didn't take it.

720
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,216
You're right,

721
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,843
I don't need to focus
on this missing treaty.

722
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,970
[Richard] No, you absolutely don't.

723
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,264
Actually, you do.

724
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,641
Emily.

725
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,850
[mellow instrumentals]

726
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,353
I'm not meant to tell you this
because it's probably rubbish.

727
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:06,938
But...

728
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,858
a curse will befall the King and Queen
responsible for breaking the treaty.

729
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,236
Seriously? A curse?

730
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,072
Concocted by a sorceress
to ensure the treaty wasn't broken.

731
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,949
Sorcery. Hardly a cause for concern.

732
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,369
If the treaty isn't signed in time,
by midnight Christmas Eve,

733
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,870
it takes effect.

734
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,373
Why are you putting stock
in this nonsense?

735
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,751
It's a curse on your firstborn.

736
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,545
On this baby?

737
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,630
Our baby.

738
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,173
According to the history book.

739
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,467
The chance of this being real
is infinitesimal.

740
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,220
I don't care if it's one in a billion,
I'm not risking it.

741
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,639
We need to find this treaty.

742
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,851
[woman over PA]  Attention, flight 1225

743
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,228
-[planes flying overhead]
-to Aldovia is still canceled.

744
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,356
Eh, no clue
when they'll start letting flights in,

745
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,025
but I'll be on the first one
as soon as they do.

746
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,986
How about you guys, how you doing?

747
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,321
Honestly, disaster on all fronts.

748
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,990
Melissa is in love with Simon.

749
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,993
We have to cancel tomorrow's baby shower,
the treaty is missing

750
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,829
and if we don't find it
by midnight on Christmas Eve,

751
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,372
our baby is cursed.

752
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,833
Hold on,
you're gonna have to explain that one.

753
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,169
-It's a long story.
-Emphasis on story,

754
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,546
and we have until Christmas Eve
to sort it out.

755
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,715
-Tomorrow's only the 23rd.
-[Rudy exhales steadily]

756
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,801
Well, I don't know much
about this supernatural stuff,

757
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,220
but go easy on Melissa, huh?

758
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,806
Love makes people do funny things.

759
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,226
You gave up New York slices and bagels
for meat jelly.

760
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,604
Oh! Could you please bring me some bagels?

761
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,938
[Rudy chuckles]

762
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,064
You got it.

763
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,817
Now, why'd you cancel your baby shower?

764
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,361
No one can get here. The storm.

765
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,531
There's plenty of people in the palace.
Have it anyway.

766
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,408
It just doesn't feel like the right time.

767
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,911
From what you're saying,
sounds like a little hope and joy

768
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,537
is just what the palace needs.

769
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,830
Have the shower.

770
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,877
-[dramatic instrumentals]
-[wind whirring]

771
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,508
[suspenseful instrumentals]

772
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,724
[Emily, echoing]
A curse upon the firstborn,

773
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,976
upon the firstborn...

774
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,020
-[whooshing effect]
-[Amber gasps, exhales]

775
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,022
[heavy exhale]

776
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,148
[hushed] Richard.

777
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,150
[curious instrumentals]

778
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,361
[fire crackles]

779
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,656
[Amber] The Royal Scandal
of the Fathers of the Silk Road Treaty.

780
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,907
Royal scandal?

781
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,869
Did you know there was a love triangle

782
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:31,457
between Prince Claude and Prince Jun
over Claude's newlywed, Princess Jocelyn?

783
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,794
I believe they taught us that
at boarding school.

784
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,004
Oh my gosh!

785
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,423
Soon after the royal treaty was signed,

786
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,969
Prince Claude was poisoned.
Many believed Prince Jun did it.

787
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,764
The house of Devon, Claude's family,
fell out of power

788
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,892
and Claude's descendants swore vengeance.

789
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,644
Devon.

790
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,522
Why does that name sound familiar?

791
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,399
[Richard snores]

792
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,279
[Amber takes a deep breath,
steadily exhales]

793
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,490
[birds chirping]

794
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,035
[serene instrumentals]

795
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,375
[footsteps approaching]

796
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,627
You're up early, my dear.

797
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,170
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

798
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,839
Baby had a restless night.

799
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,384
One day, you'll look back
on all the sleepless nights

800
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,719
and you'll realize

801
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,013
-they're amongst your sweetest memories.
-[Amber chuckles]

802
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,141
It's a big change, isn't it?

803
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,851
It's the greatest adventure,

804
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,061
but your life
will never be the same again.

805
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,187
[Amber scoffs playfully]

806
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,899
There are so many things
that I wish I could ask my mom.

807
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,194
Amber, never forget that she's right here.

808
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,656
Her spirit's in you and your baby.

809
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,076
She gave you good instincts

810
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,704
and, through your baby, she'll guide you,

811
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,456
always.

812
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,043
I'm so grateful I have you.

813
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,502
I'm here.

814
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,837
For anything.

815
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,551
When you were expecting Emily,
did you try hypnobirthing?

816
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,178
Hypnobirthing?

817
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,930
What on earth is hypnobirthing?

818
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,265
[Amber and Queen Helena laugh]

819
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,726
[Dr. Magoro through laptop]
Fear causes the body to tense up

820
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,355
and pain in childbirth
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

821
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,024
So you're saying
no pain is really an option?

822
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,984
Language is powerful

823
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,820
and we want to have
a positive view of birth.

824
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,157
For instance, instead of contractions,

825
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,993
we'll call them surges.

826
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,245
-Surges?
-[stammers] Like a surge of energy?

827
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,665
Exactly. Your body is powerful.

828
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,710
And during labor, every surge you feel

829
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,254
is a wave of relaxation,

830
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,423
pleasure and love.

831
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,674
[Richard] Hm.

832
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,218
Lucky you, men don't get those.

833
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:51,097
I want you both to lie back
and close your eyes.

834
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,725
I'm going to lead you
into a guided imagery meditation.

835
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,019
[Eastern meditative music playing]

836
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,897
Imagine a surge,

837
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,820
relaxation, pleasure, love.

838
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,658
Feel its pulse.

839
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,952
[Richard sighs heavily]

840
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,541
We thought we'd be home by now, too.

841
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,585
No, you may not peek at your presents.

842
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,338
[laughs] We'll be home
as soon as we're able.

843
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,132
Love you!

844
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,675
Bye, now.

845
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,555
[sighs] This predicament must be resolved.

846
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,016
If only the children were stuck here
with us, wouldn't be so bad.

847
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,477
No place is more Christmassy.

848
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,148
Leave it to you to find light
in any situation.

849
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,316
I assume that's why you keep me around.

850
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,443
[laughter]

851
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,945
Still, I'd like to find a way home.

852
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,739
If we don't stay to sign the truce treaty,

853
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:54,368
our kingdoms technically return
to a state of war.

854
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,457
Of course, a war
that would be fought by lawyers. [sighs]

855
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,541
Just a thought.

856
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,712
What if the Aldovians orchestrated this
on purpose?

857
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,798
They want the treaty signed
just as much as we do.

858
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,343
Unless it's a way for them to force
an unfair renegotiation of terms.

859
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,721
Renegotiation under duress?

860
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,139
No.

861
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,391
[Mr. Zabala] Good day, Your Majesties.

862
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,019
Forgive me, am I interrupting?

863
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,020
Not at all.

864
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,440
May I present,
with the compliments and best wishes

865
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,609
of Queen Amber of Aldovia.

866
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,569
Thank you and good day.

867
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:40,289
Hm. An invitation to attend
Queen Amber's royal baby shower.

868
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,540
Today.

Amber!

872
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,352
Wow.

873
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,313
-[Richard chuckles]

00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,122
-I understand the Queen's fainted?
-Yes.

1220
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,832
Yes, she fainted, but she's awake now.

1221
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,209
- She has been overdoing it.
-[Richard] I thought so.

1222
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,711
You've overdone it.

1223
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,670
She needs rest.

1224
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,130
[Richard] Rest, yes. I'll tell her.

1225
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,590
Why don't I drive to the palace?

1226
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,049
We'd be very grateful.   Thank you.

1227
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,468
She's on her way.

1228
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,303
I told you, I'm fine.

1229
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,472
Still, you must rest
until she gets here.

1230
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,599
That's doctor's and king's orders.

1231
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,350
Princess' orders as well.

1232
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:00,435
Rest.

1233
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,645
How can I
when we only have until midnight?

1234
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,106
How long?

1235
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,692
Great, thank you.

1236
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,446
The airport is opening shortly.

1237
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,073
Will you please arrange transport?

1238
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,658
I will see to it, Miss Lynn.

1239
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:23,833
There you are.

1240
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,921
Sorry, I have some news.

1241
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,797
The airport is open.

1242
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,424
The Penglians are leaving.

1243
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,842
[Queen Helena] Oh my goodness.

1244
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,512
Shall I speak to them?

1245
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,514
-Please, Mother.
-Mr. Zabala

1246
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,724
Yes, of course, Your Majesty.
Excuse me.

1247
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:44,854
What do we do now?

1248
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,773
We have to expose Simon and Lynn.

1249
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,566
It's our last hope to find the treaty.

1250
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,817
Absolutely.

1251
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,818
Simon?

1252
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,821
He and Lynn have been conspiring
since she arrived.

1253
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,491
-That's disgraceful.
-But not unexpected.

1254
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,785
Listen, something is nagging at me.

1255
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,578
Call it instinct.

1256
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:04,749
If we are correct, and Simon and Lynn
took the treaty and hid it,

1257
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,085
why didn't the police dog find it?

1258
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,170
-We'll have to ask Simon.
-But there's more.

1259
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,257
The old scandal
between Prince Claude and Prince Jun.

1260
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,926
The family swore they would get revenge.

1261
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:18,346
Maybe that's why the treaty
was nearly stolen 200 years ago.

1262
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,431
The treaty was stolen before?

1263
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,058
[Amber cries out]

1264
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,351
What, what's wrong?

1265
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,771
I don't know, cramping. [pants]
Cramping bad.

1266
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:27,981
Oh my gosh.

1267
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:28,940
Does that mean...

1268
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,984
-I think so.
-What is it?

1269
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,111
I'm going into labor.

1270
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,154
[shaky exhale]

1271
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,698
[suspenseful instrumentals]

1272
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,032
[car rushing]

1273
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,373
-[phone ringing]
-Oh.

1274
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,125
Hello? King Richard?

1275
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,794
Doctor, Amber's gone into labor.

1276
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:50,962
Labor? Now?

1277
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,507
No, no, no, she's not due
until January, Your Majesty.

1278
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,551
Her back hurts and she has cramping.

1279
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,512
Could be forced labor
due to over activity.

1280
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,680
She has been very active.

1281
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,726
Tell the Queen,
deep breaths and remain calm.

1282
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,227
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

1283
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,645
See you very soon. Bye.

1284
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,402
-[owl screeches]
-Ooh!

1285
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,695
[tires squealing]

1286
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:17,989
-[brakes screeching]
-[gasps]

1287
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,034
[gasps, pants]

1288
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,785
[engine hissing]

1289
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,621
[Amber exhales deeply]

1290
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,708
-Is it true? Have you gone into labor?
-It appears so.

1291
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,378
-How far apart are the contractions?
-Close. Getting stronger.

1292
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,464
We call them surges as per the doctor

1293
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,424
-who's on her way.
-[phone ringing]

1294
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,010
This is her.

1295
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,305
[Dr. Magoro] King Richard...

1296
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,391
I found myself in a bit of a situation.

1297
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,518
[exhales] Where are you?

1298
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,562
North road. Stay in your car.

1299
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:50,688
What is it?

1300
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,023
She's stuck in a snow bank.

1301
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,191
But the baby's coming.

1302
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,527
I used to volunteer at a maternity ward.
I will help you through this.

1303
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:57,862
[Amber sighs]

1304
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,114
Tai, cancel our flight.

1305
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,033
Of course. Lynn!

1306
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,409
Thank you, Queen Ming.

1307
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,161
-I'll get Dr. Magoro.
-[exhales] Richard!

1308
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,996
I'll be back with her as soon as I can.

1309
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,082
You can do this, birth plan or not.

1310
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:09,999
I love you.

1311
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,210
-I love you.
-[kissing sound]

1312
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,379
-[Amber inhales]
-Take care of her, please.

1313
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,546
[Amber exhales in pain]

1314
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:16,923
[Amber gasps]

1315
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,800
Richard, we heard about Amber.
Is there--

1316
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,718
-[gruff] I'll deal with you later.
-[Simon] Wh--

1317
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,097
[Amber exhales]

1318
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,519
[suspenseful instrumentals continue]

1319
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,978
[snow crunching]

1320
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,735
-Good boy, let's go.
-[thudding]

1321
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,988
I too had the baby come early.

1322
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,615
-You did?
-My son.

1323
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,533
He's okay?

1324
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,910
He's intelligent, capable

1325
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,455
-and has the energy of three boys.
-[Amber sighs]

1326
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,333
Your baby will be perfectly fine.

1327
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,877
Your child is strong, Amber.
Like you and Richard.

1328
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,964
But I can't help but worry
that it's going to be midnight soon.

1329
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,007
If that treaty isn't signed,

1330
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,884
my baby is cursed.

1331
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:02,885
Emily!

1332
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,180
I told you not to worry Amber
with that nonsense.

1333
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:07,974
But what if it's true?

1334
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:11,269
Sorcery was discredited a long time ago,

1335
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:12,520
for good reason.

1336
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,732
Many old treaties
involved punitive superstitions.

1337
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,192
-It's not unusual.
-[Amber sighs]

1338
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,945
Tell me about this one.

1339
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,407
Well, what I read
was about a sorceress that cast a spell.

1340
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:26,451
[dramatic instrumentals]

1341
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,785
[hooves knocking]

1342
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,083
-[wolf howls in distance]
-[horse neighs]

1343
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,128
[continued howling]

1344
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,338
Not tonight.

1345
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,590
[horse chuffs]

1346
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,800
-Come on!
-[horse brays]

1347
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,802
The curse affects the firstborn child

1348
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,846
of whichever kingdom
causes the truce to break.

1349
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,433
Typical for its time,
but that time is not our time.

1350
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,476
Still...

1351
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,853
You don't want to risk it, I understand,

1352
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,397
as small a chance as it may be.

1353
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,734
A mother's love for her child
is greater than anything.

1354
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:03,362
Someone in this palace
sabotaged the signing of the treaty. Why?

1355
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,031
[Amber gasping]

1356
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,409
[exhales] Your Majesty!
I've spoken to the doctor

1357
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:12,455
and she said it's acceptable
to administer pain medication for your...

1358
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,749
surges.

1359
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,543
Thank you, Mrs. Averill,
but I need to keep my mind sharp.

1360
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,586
Amber...

1361
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,131
We all want what's best for your baby
and for you.

1362
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,967
Please try not to worry needlessly.

1363
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,511
Maybe it isn't needless.

1364
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,430
It could be real.
After all, our dungeon is haunted.

1365
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,307
-Haunted?
-Yes.

1366
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,100
Mr. Little even encountered it,

1367
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,937
the ghost of the thief
who stole the treaty 200 years ago.

1368
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,064
[breathless] Emily, listen to me.

1369
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,234
I need you to do something
for me right now. [sharp exhale]

1370
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,319
[eerie instrumentals]

1371
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,910
Why on earth
did Amber want us to come down here?

1372
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,663
She insists we search the furthest corner.

1373
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,627
[Emily] Pray we avoid the ghost
that haunts this dungeon.

1374
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,005
You're not scared
of the made-up ghost, are you?

1375
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,603
[indistinct rattling]

1376
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:18,980
What was that?

1377
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,983
Just-- Just our imaginations.

1378
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,526
Working in unison.

1379
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,028
Come along.

1380
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,617

1383
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,344
[Emily] Leopold was here.

1384
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,513
Now we are.

[yelling] Help!

01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,314
Oh, dear.

01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,566
[Emily, yelling] Help! Help us!

1391
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,651
Help!

1392
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,653
Please help!

1393
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,448

[galloping tread]

1396
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,472
Dr. Magoro?

1397
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,350
-Are you all right?
-I am now, thank you.

1398
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,727
I trust you know how to ride. [exhales]

1399
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,646
-I do, indeed.
-[door clicks open]

1400

[horse brays]

1401
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,156
-[Amber exhales heavily]
-[Queen Ming] You're doing good.

1402
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,282
[Amber groans]

1403
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,993
-Poor thing.
-[continued groaning]

1404
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:58,955
[shaky breathing]

1405
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,040
[heavy sigh]

1406
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,626
This is not the time, Simon.

1407
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:07,797
Amber.

1408
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,549
You look like you could use these.

1409
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,302
Squeeze these
when you're feeling overwhelmed.

1410
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:15,221
Works for me.

1411
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,390
Thank you, Simon.

1412
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,269
[labored breathing]

1413
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,314
The hot water you requested, Your Majesty.

1414
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,316
[Amber moans]

1415
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,445
I need a heating pad
and a paint roller with a good handle.

1416
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,572
Of course, straight away.

1417
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,702
I have a heating pad
and good luck with the roller.

1418
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,705
Is there anything we can do to help?

1419
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,417
I am charged
with finding a paint roller in a palace.

1420
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,378
-I possess such an item.
-[playful instrumentals]

1421
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,546
-Really?
-You do?

1422
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,214
With a good handle?

1423
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:53,092
A very excellent handle, yes.

1424
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,052
And may I ask why?

1425
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,471
No, you may not, Andrew.

1426
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,224
Come, Mr. Z.

1427
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,810
-We will get it.
-Thank you.

1428
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,273
[gulps, sighs]

1429
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,942
[Emily, yelling] Help! Please help us!

1430
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,360
Help!

1431
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,946
It's no use, darling, no one can hear us.

1432
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,906
-[dramatic instrumentals]
-[Emily sighs]

1433
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,534
Look, a key!

1434
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,665
-[sighs] It's too far.
-[strained exhale]

1435
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,501
[breathless] That's really helping.

1436
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,503
How long did you volunteer
at the hospital?

1437
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,672
-Many years.
-You certainly learned a lot.

1438
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:35,259
I learned no job is more demanding
or rewarding than motherhood.

1439
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,428
Penglia now has services in place

1440
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:41,098
to assist and support all of our mothers
in any way they might need.

1441
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,184
[exhales] I heard about that program,
it's fantastic.

1442
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,269
I'm trying to implement
something similar here,

1443
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:46,729
with a few updates.

1444
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,231
-[dramatic instrumentals]
-[strained sighs]

1445
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,694
-You're so close.
-[grunts]

1446
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,322
That's it, almost.

1447
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,115
You have it, you've got it.

1448
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:00,159
-You got it!
-[strains]

1449
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,787
There you are. Good girl.

1450
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,830
Almost there.

1451
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,624
Lift it up.

1452
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,627
-[Queen Helena] Oh!
-[Emily yells]

1453
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,669
-Emily!
-[thud]

1454
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,130
Emily, are you all right?

1455
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,633
-Yes, I'm fine.
-The stone didn't hurt you?

1456
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:17,968
Look, in there.

1457
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,304
-I can't believe it.
-The missing treaty.

1458
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,640
[hissing breath]

1459
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,350
What was that?

1460
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,685
-[wind whirring]
-[Emily gasps]

1461
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,938
The ghost, coming to get the treaty.

1462
01:08:29,021 --> 01:08:30,689
-[pants]
-No, listen.

1463
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:31,941
[wind whistling]

1464
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:34,235
It's the wind blowing through the stones.

1465
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,071
-[stammers] So, no ghost?
-[exhales]

1466
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:38,781
No.

1467
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,034
But we have the treaty.

1468
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,578
But we're still locked in.

1469
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:48,999
[wind rushing]

1470
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,709
[horse neighs]

1471
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,088
-[Richard] Amber.
-[Amber] Richard.

1472
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,882
-[Richard pants] How are you?
-No baby yet.

1473
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,301
Everything's going to be fine,
Your Majesty.

1474
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,262
How far apart are the surges?

1475
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,930
Five minutes, progressing steadily.

1476
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:05,391
Ah. Thank you for being so attentive.

1477
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:07,977
[Amber sighs]

1478
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,187
[wind whirring]

1479
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:11,438
It's useless.

1480
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:13,065
It's nearly midnight.

1481
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:14,775
It's over.

1482
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,194
We mustn't give up.

1483
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:18,821
But what can we do?

1484
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,327
This.

1485
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,790
[chuckles] Brilliant, Mother.

1486
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,250
[plucky instrumentals]

1487
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:37,798
[rattling]

1488
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,550
[click]

1489
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,010
The linens, doctor.

1490
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,345
[Amber] What time is it?

1491
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,639
Ten minutes to midnight.

1492
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,433
[breathless] Where are they?

1493
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,852
The treaty, we found the treaty.

1494
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:50,936
What? Where?

1495
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,479
In the dungeon.

1496
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,691
How did you know?

1497
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,276
Amber solved the mystery.

1498
01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,069
I did.

1499
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,531
Come in, everyone.
You all need to hear this.

1500
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,452
Someone right here,
in this very room, stole the treaty.

1501
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,872
[Richard] Tell us everything you know.

1502
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,917
The scandal that followed the signing
of the treaty

1503
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,502
resulted in the alleged poisoning
of Prince Claude.

1504
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,671
His family swore vengeance

1505
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,216
and a member of that family
is in this room.

1506
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:22,259
[Richard] Go on.

1507
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,096
Prince Claude's family name,
Devon, was familiar to me

1508
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,098
and tonight I remembered why.

1509
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,934
I read it in this book.

1510
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,103
Your mother's maiden name was Devin.

1511
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,606
Wasn't it, Mr. Little?

1512
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:36,732
[gasping]

1513
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:43,405
I know it was you, Mr. Little.

1514
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,993
You were the last one
to lock up the treaty,

1515
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,037
you kept the dog out of the dungeon

1516
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,456
and you tried to keep Emily
out of the dungeon

1517
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:54,416
with some made-up ghost story.

1518
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,501
[Amber sighs]

1519
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,796
-[continued sighing]
-If you're guilty, Mr. Little,

1520
01:10:59,463 --> 01:11:00,839
confess here and now.

1521
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,216
I did do it.

1522
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,260
To break the truce

1523
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,553
and sever our ties with Penglia.

1524
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:08,389
But why?

1525
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,808
I was bound by a solemn blood oath,

1526
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:14,353
a sworn duty
to avenge the crime against my family

1527
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,355
by the Penglian Prince Jun.

1528
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,109
Mr. Little,
Prince Jun's guilt was never proven.

1529
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,279
Our historians believe
that the real culprit

1530
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,572
was a covetous feudal lord.

1531
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:28,117
I had a duty. I fulfilled it.

1532
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,744
You nearly started a war.

1533
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,497
And could have cursed an innocent baby.

1534
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,542
I didn't know about the curse
until tonight.

1535
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:40,629
And I would never bring harm
to your baby.

1536
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,549
-[Queen Helena] Mr. Zabala.
-Ma'am?

1537
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,219
Take Mr. Little to the Leopold Suite.

1538
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,512
-[dark instrumentals]
-At once.

1539
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,142
Simon,

1540
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:55,644
I apologize for my behavior earlier.

1541
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:57,855
Did you think...

1542
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:00,482
We had our suspicions.

1543
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:03,986
Not you, too!

1544
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,156
Lynn and I have been working diligently

1545
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:10,743
on economic amendments to the treaty
which should benefit both kingdoms.

1546
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:13,203
And we've found a very promising solution.

1547
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,956
That's all it was, I promise.

1548
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,168
What is it?

1549
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:23,464
When I came to your room last night
after Lynn left, you hid something.

1550
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,466
[stammers] How can that relate
to the treaty?

1551
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:27,718
It didn't.

1552
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,097
Lynn was helping to make sure
I chose well

1553
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,683
when picking out the most important gift
I'll offer you.

1554
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,101
[emotional instrumentals]

1555
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,187
I wanted to wait until tomorrow, but...

1556
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,231
Melissa, my love...

1557
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,318
Although I'm undeserving of such an honor,

1558
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:46,987
will you marry me?

1559
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:50,741
-[whimsical instrumentals]
-Yes! Yes.

1560
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,159
-Yes!
-[laughter]

1561
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,327
[Melissa gasps]

1562
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,245
[continued laughter]

1563
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,542
[Richard] Congratulations.

1564
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,087
Congratulations, Simon.

1565
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,588
