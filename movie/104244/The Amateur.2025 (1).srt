但是嫌疑犯暴露了，他们知道 
but the suspects are exposed, and they knew it.

279
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,917
-武装警察!放下武器!趴下!
- Armed police! Drop your weapons! - Get down!

280
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,624
莎拉的凶手更难追踪 
Sarah's killer is harder to track.

281
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,667
他似乎感觉到了摄像机 他什么也没说 
He seems to sense the cameras. He says nothing.

282
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,957
但是我处理了所有的闭路电视，手机...
But I processed all the CCTV, cell phones...

283
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,624
行车记录仪，车身凸轮...
dash cams, body cams...

284
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,708
和音频给我们一个360 
and the audio to give us a 360.

285
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,125
这为我们提供了身份证 
And that provides us with an ID.

286
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,666
这是Horst Schiller.
This is Horst Schiller.

287
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,832
与数十个mercs和国防团体的松散联系 
Loose affiliations with dozens of mercs and defense groups.

288
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,541
我还在填写 
I'm still filling that in.

289
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,582
他们似乎是作为接口操作...
They seem to be operating as interface...

290
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,666
在不良的国家行为者和恐怖主义实体之间 
between bad state actors and terrorist entities.

291
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,083
所有的生意 
All business.

292
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,042
他们继续被雇用 
And they keep getting hired.

293
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:31,166
但对于这一个，我有一个当前位置 
But for this one, I have a current location.

294
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,832
格雷琴·弗兰克.
Gretchen Frank.

295
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,500
前亚美尼亚人 
Former Armenian IO.

296
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,583
她在巴黎.
She's in Paris.

297
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,125
在这家咖啡馆给她买面包 
Buys her bread at this cafe.

298
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,583
经常出现在那里 
Turns up there regularly.

299
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,167
你知道这个？
You knew this?

300
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,542
谢谢 
Thank you.

301
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,333
-我们来比较一下.等等.
- We'll do a comparison. - Wait.

302
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,041
你已经知道格雷琴·弗兰克的事了？
You already know about Gretchen Frank?

303
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:01,083
我知道你想看到进步，查理 
I understand you wanna see progress, Charlie.

304
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,333
但有时候，最好的做法是...
But sometimes, the best course of action...

305
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,708
并不总是最明显的 
isn't always the most obvious.

306
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:07,791
“最明显”？
"Most obvious"?

307
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,707
我们想要整个网络 
We want the whole network.

308
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,624
网络与莎拉无关 
The network has nothing to do with Sarah.

309
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,666
但是一切都与主权有关
But everything to do with the sovereignty

310
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,833
和这个国家的安全 
and security of this country.

311
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:21,917
你的所作所为对我们的所作所为非常重要，查理 
What you do is very important to what we do, Charlie.

312
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:26,167
我们认为见到加里森博士对您有好处 
We think it would be good for you to see Dr. Garrison.

313
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:35,000
我来这里是为了我自己还是机构？
Am I here for me or the Agency?

314
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:39,666
重要的是，我们评估您是否足够健康，可以重返工作岗位 
It is important we assess you're well enough to return to work.

315
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:40,875
很明显.
Obviously.

316
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,708
但是你遭受了可怕的损失 
But you've suffered a terrible loss.

317
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,250
我们想支持你 
And we want to support you.

318
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,792
你能描述一下你的感受吗？
Can you describe your feelings?

319
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,708
现在？
Right now?

320
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,666
你是说，否认，愤怒...
You mean, denial, anger...

321
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:57,917
接受...
acceptance...

322
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,250
说更多 
Say more.

323
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,750
她走了.
She's gone.

324
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,125
是的，她必须这样走 
Yeah, that she had to go like that.

325
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,625
她打电话时我没有和她通电话 
And that I didn't speak to her on the phone when she called.

326
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,042
-你为此责怪自己？-是的.
- And you blame yourself for that? - Yes.

327
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,291
她让我去的时候没有和她一起去，
For not going with her when she asked me to,

328
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,792
因为我从来没有 
because I never do.

329
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,500
从来没有 
Never did.

330
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,208
那让你有什么感觉？
And what is that making you feel?

331
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:55,167
很没用 
Pretty useless.

332
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:58,250
生气了.
Angry.

333
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,167
非常非常生气 
Very, very angry.

334
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:12,707
我给了局里杀害莎拉的凶手的名字 
I gave the Agency the names of Sarah's killers.

335
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,000
他们什么也没做 
They did nothing.

336
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,042
-你想让他们做什么？-他们的工作!
- What do you want them to do? - Their job!

337
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,708
我要他们去追杀莎拉的凶手 
I want them to go after Sarah's killers.

338
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,500
这会让你感觉好些吗？
Will that make you feel better?

339
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,332
这不应该是关于我的 
This shouldn't be about me.

340
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,792
莎拉很重要 
Sarah mattered.

341
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,292
她应该得到更多 
She deserves more.

342
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,125
但归根结底，这是关于你的 
But in the end, this is about you.

343
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,333
莎拉走了.
Sarah's gone.

344
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,333
你必须试着接受这一点 
You are gonna have to try and come to terms with that.

345
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,667
我可以帮忙.
I can help.

346
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,250
但只有你能真正让事情变得更好 
But only you can really make things better.

楼层减五 解密和分析

348
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:29,916
装修时间表呢？

349
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,667
我们可以讨论密码学项目 
We can discuss the cryptography project.

350
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,624
好吧.我能做到.
Okay. All right. I can do this.

351
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,833
谢谢 我想我们需要标记这个 
Thanks. I think we need to flag this.

352
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,667
你最近一直很安静 
You've been very quiet lately.

353
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,833
猜到我住在哪里了吗？
Guessed where I live yet?

354
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,666
你能在这里呆一会儿吗，伙计？
You good here for a minute, buddy?

355
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,249
我得把后门关上.
I gotta close up the back.

356
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,500
哦，是的.是啊.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

357
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,583
我把你掩护在这里 
I got you covered out here.

358
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:08,125
七楼 执行

I'm holding the highlights of over 100 eyes-only cables.

360
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:28,041
这些是从喀布尔站的数据缓存中双重编码的 
These are double coded from a data cache out of Kabul Station.

361
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,542
这些是官方电报 
These are the official cables.

362
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,207
相同的日期，相同的事件...
Same dates, same events...

363
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,374
除了非常关键的信息...

364
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:38,875
已被更改或完全从记录中删除 
that has been altered or completely scrubbed from the record.

365
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,125
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

366
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:45,625
这是你的掩饰 
This is your cover-up.

367
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,124
你疯了吗？
Have you lost your mind?

368
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,374
委婉地说 
To put it mildly.

369
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:53,332
这是你摧毁叙利亚一家医院的行动命令 
This is your order of operations to destroy a hospital in Syria.

370
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,624
在也门的盟军基地

阿富汗政客的房子

372
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,457
你不知道...
You have no idea what...

373
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,874
索马里的过境点 
A border crossing in Somalia.

374
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,332
我统计了1,000多人伤亡...
I count more than 1,000 casualties...

375
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:05,291
超过400名平民死亡

376
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,957
只是出于对你最近损失的尊重...
It's only out of respect for your recent loss...

377
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,332
我不会把你赶出这个办公室 
that I'm not throwing you out of this office.

378
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,707
我只想告诉你，你一点头绪都没有 
I'm just gonna tell you, you don't have a goddamn clue.

379
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,791
你看到了吗？
You see right here?

380
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,167
车队？
The convoy?

381
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,625
你瞄准了我们的盟友 
You targeted our allies.

382
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:20,749
你给它加了假标记 
You false-flagged it.

383
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,457
你让他们都被解雇了...
You got them all fired up...

384
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,000
然后把它们吸回你想要的地方 
and then sucked them right back in where you wanted them.

385
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,749
你在强迫任务爬行 
You were forcing mission creep.

386
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,292
好了够了.
Okay. That's enough.

387
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,750
"够了"？
"That's enough"?

388
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,375
这些不是操作选择 
These were not operational choices.

389
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,375
先生，你做出了政治决定

这些上面都是你的签名

391
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,457
这里和这里 还有这里.

392
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,166
-你远远高于你的工资等级 -还有这里.
- You are so far above your pay grade. - And here.

393
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,957
你说得对.你说得对.
Well, you're right. You're right.

394
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,832
也许我们应该...
Maybe we should...

395
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,542
把这个和导演联系起来？
take this up with the director?

396
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,583
让她打电话吗？
Let her call it?

397
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,541
也许是为了《泰晤士报》或《邮报》 
Or maybe it's for the Times or the Post.

398
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,082
你带着这个去过媒体吗？
You've been to the press with this?

399
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:02,374
-你会进监狱的，白痴.也许吧.
- You'll go to jail, idiot. - Maybe.

400
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,249
但我们都会在一起 
But we'll all be there together.

401
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,667
我们在这里有一个任务 
We have a mission here.

402
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,500
一个责任

403
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,750
我们将不惜一切手段保卫我们的国家 
We'll defend our nation by any means necessary.

404
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:16,332
我不认为海勒先生来这里是为了辩论道德和实践，对吗？
I don't think Mr. Heller came here to debate ethics and practices, right?

405
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,417
没错.
Right.

406
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,957
首先，你要知道我设置了一个死人开关 
First, you need to know that I've set up a dead man's switch.

407
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,707
如果我每五个小时不编码...
If I don't code in every five hours...

408
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:25,749
这些文件将自动发送
these files will automatically be sent

409
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,041
三位顶级调查记者...
to three top investigative journalists...

410
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,874
以及事件的详细报告和时间表 
along with a detailed report and timeline of the events.

411
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,624
24小时后，这些文件将向公众发布 
Twenty-four hours later, the files will be released to the public.

412
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,791
我明白了.
I get it.

413
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,457
我们杀了你，沃尔夫·布利策赢得艾美奖 
We kill you, Wolf Blitzer wins an Emmy.

414
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,666
不，不只是杀了我 
No. Not just kill me.

415
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,541
你把我关进监狱，你黑了我，你引渡了我...
You put me in jail, you black-site me, you extradite me...

416
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,207
你只会谴责自己 
you'll only condemn yourselves.

417
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,957
那你到底想要什么？
Then what the hell do you want?

418
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:48,249
他想让我们杀了杀他妻子的人 
He wants us to kill the people who killed his wife.

419
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,833
不，不.
No. No.

420
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,292
我不想让你杀了他们 
I don't want you to kill them.

421

我想亲手杀了他们.
I wanna kill them myself.

422
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,917
-你说什么？-你听到了.
- I beg your pardon? - You heard me.

423
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:04,250
我想找到并杀死谋杀我妻子的人 
I want to find and kill the people who murdered my wife.

424

中情局会训练我的.
The CIA will train me.

425
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,624
我是说，这是个恶作剧，对吧？
I mean, this is a practical joke, right?

426
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,916
我不认为你能打败一个90岁的修女
I don't think you could beat a 90-year-old nun

427
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,292
在一场摔跤比赛中 
in an arm-wrestling match.

428
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,667
真有趣.
That's funny.

429
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,542
幽默？
Humor?

430
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:21,082
我想要特定任务的训练...
I want mission-specific training...

431
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:23,791
以及公司掌握的关于这些人的所有信息 
and all the information the company has on these people.

432
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,000
现金 还有一个新的身份 一个传奇.
Cash. And a new identity. A legend.

433
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,583
还有别的吗？
Anything else?

434
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,375
阿斯顿·马丁？
An Aston Martin?

435
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,458
也许是喷气背包？
A jet pack, maybe?

436
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,958
我想要一个战斗的机会 
I want a fighting chance.

437
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,499
我们怎么知道他真的设置了死者的开关？
How do we know he really set up the dead man's switch?

438
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,666
我们没有.
We don't.

439
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,582
我们需要对此保密 
We need to keep a lid on this.

440
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,708
没错.
Right.

441
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,167
所以，让我们一起玩...
So, let's play along...

442
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,667
直到我们确定 
till we're sure.

443
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,999
什么？实际上训练他？
What? Actually train him?

444
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,541
它能做什么伤害？
What harm can it do?

445
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,707
可能是他自己退出的 
Probably quit of his own accord.

446
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:27,667
同时，把帕克带到他身上 
Meanwhile, get Park onto him.

447
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,666
真不敢相信我会这么做 
I can't believe I'm doing this.

448
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:33,624
我们擦洗他的生活，直到找到开关 
We scrub his life till we find the switch.

449
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,124
如果它存在 
If it exists.

450
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,707
如果不是...
If it doesn't...

451
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,625
也许有训练事故 
well, maybe there's a training accident.

452
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,958
让我们用亨德森

- I got 'em. - The HDMI cables are in the box.

466
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,999
我打赌他是在虚张声势.
My bet is he's bluffing.

467
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,083
这个人的智商为170 我们不要假设 
The man has an IQ of 170. Let's not assume.

468
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,374

469
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,958

and there's not a chance he got past them with a digital file.

470
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,999
那他为什么在盲点站了40多分钟？
Then why is he standing in blind spots for over 40 minutes?

471

485
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,291
只有一点点机会？
Only a slight chance?

486
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:34,083
我高估了你的几率来增强你的信心，孩子

等等 你认为他用了撇渣器？

他们在打印机上工作

这里没有车 
There's no drive here.

555
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,291
好吧 这就是我们没有找到的 
Okay. That's what we didn't find.

556
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:32,833
但是我们发现了什么？
But what did we find?

557
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:37,250
我不知道，这是卡在点唱机下面的 
I don't know, this was stuck under the jukebox.

558
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,708
给我25美分.
Give me a quarter.

559
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,417
拉动光盘 
Pull the disc.

560
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,667
你...
You...

561
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:09,625
不是杀手.

562
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:12,625
没有？
No?

563
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,625
-嘿，你是谁？-别管他们.
- Hey, who's this? - Leave them.

564
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,458
这些混蛋杀了你妻子，嗯？
These the assholes that killed your wife, huh?

565
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,999
那么，你打算怎么把它们都拿出来？
So, how do you plan to take them all out?

566
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,332
你杀的第一个，
The first one you kill,

567
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,749
你让其他人知道你要来 
you let the other ones know you're coming.

568
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,333
然后呢？你有什么计划？
And then what? What's your plan?

569
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,042
你要怎么让兰利的人远离你？
How are you gonna keep the people at Langley off your ass?

570
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,375
这就是我需要你教我的 
That's what I need you to teach me.

571
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,125
好吧.我来教你.
All right. I'll teach you.

572
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,499
拿去吧.
Take it.

573
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,499
别这样.-去吧，拿着.
- Come on. - Go on, take it.

574
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,416
什么事？你是什么...
What is it? What are you...

575
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,875
拿着!现在!嘿!
- Take it! Now! - Hey!

576
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,083
指着我的胸口 
Point it at my chest.

577
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,416
-指向我的胸口!-你觉得...
- Point it at my chest! - You think that...

578
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:50,832
-现在就做!-好吧，好吧.
- Do it now! - All right, all right.

579
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,417
把你的手指放在扳机上!
Put your finger on the trigger!

580
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:55,999
来吧.
Come on.

581
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,083
看着我.
Look at me.

582
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,250
来吧.
Come on.

583
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,917
来吧，查理 
Come on, Charlie.

584
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,125
瘫痪，不是吗？
Paralyzing, isn't it?

585
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,917
用活武器指着这样的人 
Pointing a live weapon at someone like that.

586
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,999
你要么非常自信，要么非常愚蠢...
You have to either be very confident or very stupid...

587
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,208
这是它自己的一种信心 
which is its own kind of confidence.

588
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,457
事实是你没有那种自信 
Truth is you don't have that kinda confidence.

589
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:33,374
你也不傻.一点也不 
And you are not stupid. Not in the slightest.

590
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,042
你不是杀手Charlie.
You're just not a killer, Charlie.

591
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:37,833
人们有一定的天赋 
People have certain gifts.

592
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:42,042
你不能做我做的事，不管我怎么训练你...
You can't do what I do, no matter how much I train you...

593
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,874
尽管你不能教我如何破解密码 
as much as you can't teach me how to break code.

594
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,167
我不能让你变成你不是的东西 
I can't make you into somethin' that you're not.

595
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:50,000
对不起.
I'm sorry.

596
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,458
到时候...
When the time comes...

597
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,082
我来扣动扳机.
I'll pull the trigger.

598
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,708
到时候...
When the time comes...

599
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,208
你甚至不记得子弹是从枪的哪一端射出的 
you won't even remember which end of the gun the bullet comes out of.

600
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:10,875
这要花多长时间？
How long is this gonna take?

601
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:14,750
有了这个加密，四五个小时 
With this encryption, four or five hours.

602
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,207
如果她不能破解海勒的密码呢？
What if she can't break Heller's encryption?

603
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,333
她会的.
She will.

604
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,375
我们怎么知道他没有复印50份？
How do we know he didn't make 50 copies?

605
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:28,042
我们没有.
We don't.

606
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,041
阿里 
Ali.

607
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,249
我们进去了.
We're in.

608
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,542
这是虚张声势 
It's a bluff.

609
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,124
他在耍我们.
He was playing us.

610
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,875
他也做得很好 
And he did pretty well, too.

611
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,167
让他离开董事会？
Take him off the board?

612
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,458
是啊.
Yeah.

613
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,417
好的.
Okay.

614
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:19,249
他走了？
He's gone?

615
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,749
他有一个装满护照的袋子...
He's got a bag full of passports...

616
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,541
甚至入侵了生物识别技术 
even hacked the biometrics.

617
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,124
是的，他用看门人的卡出来了 
Yeah, he got out on a janitor's card.

618
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,250
这是个笑话.
This is a joke.

619
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,874
也许你们都误判了这个人 
Maybe y'all misjudged this individual.

620
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:28,875
你觉得呢？
You think?

621
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,292
他很清楚自己在做什么 
He knew exactly what he was doin'.

622
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,542
让我们追逐面包屑足够长的时间...
Kept us chasin' breadcrumbs just long enough...

623
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,750
虽然他得到了一些训练 
while he got himself some training.

624
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:16,333
海勒先生...
Mr. Heller...

625
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,375
窃听中情局官员...
bugging a CIA officer...

626
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,333
是叛国.
is treason.

627
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:39,582
女士们先生们，欢迎乘坐美国航空公司aa143航班...
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard American Airlines flight AA143...

628
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:42,875

630

631
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,416
什么事？
Yes?

632
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:56,375
好吧，你可以打开它们 
Okay, you can open them.

633
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,500
生日快乐.
Happy birthday.

634
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,082
它崩溃了吗？
Did it crash?

635
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:13,207
显然它没有被正确地绑住，被扔了...
Apparently it wasn't tied down properly and got thrown around...

636
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,042
龙卷风或飓风什么的 
in a tornado or hurricane or something.

637
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,792
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

638
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,167
我无话可说 
I have no words.

639
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,541
是吗？-是的.
-Yeah? - Yeah.

640
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:26,083
这不是疯了吗？
It's not crazy?

641
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,208
它需要一些工作 
It needs some work.

642
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:34,625
你觉得呢？
You think?

643
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,500
这...
This...

644
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:43,875
这是我见过的最美的东西.
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

645
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,291
是吗？

646
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,625

648
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,542
生日快乐.

649
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,333
 .. 巴黎现在将从第二站台出发 
...Paris will be departing now from platform two.

650
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,207
他在伦敦.
He's in London.

651
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:17,207
他的一本护照在去巴黎的路上刚刚在移民局亮了起来 
One of his passports just lit up at immigration on his way to Paris.

652
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,457
-我去找当地联络员.-没有.
- I'll grab local liaison. - No.

653
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,000
这个留在我们身边 
This stays with us.

654
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,875
那Henderson呢？
What about Henderson?

655
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,250
给他打电话.
Call him.

656
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,416
嘿，那里，lockpick粉丝 
Hey, there, lockpick fans.

657
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:43,624
好吧 今天我们要选一把公寓式的锁 
Okay. Today we're gonna pick an apartment-style lock.

658
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,374
所以我们要做的第一件事
So, the first thing we're gonna do

659
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,874
你要拿着你的张力扳手...
is you're gonna take your tension wrench...

660
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:50,291
你要把它插在钥匙孔和插头的底部...
and you're gonna stick it in the bottom of the keyhole and the plug...

661
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,125
就像这样.感觉到了吗？
just like so. Feel it?

662
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:56,249
你只需要施加一点压力，就一点点 
You're gonna apply just a little bit of pressure, just a little bit.

663
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,624
嘿，你不要太多 
Hey, you don't want too much.

664
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,999
太多了，接下来会发生的是别针会绑在你身上...
Too much and what's gonna happen is the pins are gonna bind up on you...

665
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,249
而且您将无法将它们放在剪切线上 
and you won't be able to get 'em up on a shear line.

666
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,874
你进不了那扇门.
And you're not gonna get into that door.

667
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,541
所以，轻轻地，轻轻地...
So, gently, gently...

668
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:13,582
感觉它来回旋转，仔细听 
and feel it rotate back and forwards, listening carefully.

669
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,207
只是轻触 
Just a light touch.

670
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:18,124
所有的针脚都会排成一行 
All the pins are gonna line up.

671
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:21,374
然后，你进去了 给你.
And then, you're in. There you go.

672
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:22,666
如何开锁
How to pick a lock.

673
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:23,833

Pretty darn easy.

我会把它们都拿出来 
I'll get all of them.

682
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:59,458
你一定做了什么坏事 
You must have done something really bad.

683
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,833
还没有.
Not yet.

684
00:53:58,833 --> 00:53:59,958
是花粉.
It's pollen.

685
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,166
你是谁？
Who are you?

686
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,832
告诉我霍斯特·席勒在哪里，我会让你出去 
Tell me where Horst Schiller is and I'll let you out.

687
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,667

690
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,958

691
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,332
把门打开.
Open the door.

692
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,416
对不起.除非你告诉我.
I'm sorry. Not until you tell me.

693
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:28,417
拜托，告诉我他在哪里 
Please, just tell me where he is.

694
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:30,125
为什么？
Why?

695
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:32,458
因为你杀了我妻子 
Because you killed my wife.

696
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:34,958
她的名字叫莎拉 
Her name was Sarah.

697
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,458
告诉我他在哪.
Tell me where he is.

698
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:39,583
告诉我!

00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:41,374
告诉我!
Tell me!

700
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:42,916
我不...我不知道.
I don't... I don't know.

701
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:44,000
他联系...
He contacts...

702
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:46,832
他联系我们 
He contacts us.

703
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:47,917
信使...
Messenger...

704
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,667
我听不见.
I can't hear you.

705
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,208
我听不见.
I can't hear you.

706
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,167
妈的!
Shit!

707
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:54,542
妈的.
Shit.

708
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:00,708
你好.
Hello.

709
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:03,833
37欧元，先生.
37 euros, please, sir.

710
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,500
我们对格雷琴·弗兰克了解多少？
What do we know about Gretchen Frank?

711
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:58,542
我们的人说她自己的人把她撞倒了 
Our people say one of her own folks ran her down.

712
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:02,583
最有可能是伦敦工作南下时的后果 
Most likely fallout from when the London job went south.

713
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:04,916
我会让州政府知道的 
I'll let State know.

714
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:06,249
法国大使问 
French ambassador is asking.

715
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,375
不是我们.
Wasn't us.

716
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:29,042
你要啤酒吗？
You want a beer?

717
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:32,875
是的 是啊，当然 
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

718
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,291
你怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

719
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:43,958
你给格雷琴·弗兰克打了电话 
Phone you pulled off Gretchen Frank.

720
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:46,333
-就像雷达一样.-妈的.
- It's like a radar ping. - Shit.

721
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:48,749
不管你有多聪明 
Doesn't matter how smart you are.

722
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,708
如果你惊慌失措，那总是会搞砸一个好计划 
If you panic, that will always screw up a good plan.

723
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,583
然后是生存本能 
Then there's the survival instinct.

724
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,583
没有人容易倒下 
No one goes down easy.

725
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,249
当然，还有后果...
And, of course, the aftermath...

726
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,583
当你意识到你做了一些你永远无法撤消的事情 
when you realize you've done something you can't undo, ever.

727
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,750
我可以忍受 
I can live with that.

728
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,083
你不能.
You can't.

729
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,374
你让我吃惊，查理 
You surprised me, Charlie.

730
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:22,457
我不能告诉你这是多么罕见 
I can't tell you how rare that is.

731
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,667
但它在这里结束 
But it ends here.

732
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,750
这项工作中没有三齐射致敬 
There are no three-volley salutes in this work.

733
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:33,041
如果我们被发现，我们就是在垃圾箱里被发现的约翰 
We're the John Does that get found in the dumpster, if we get found.

734
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,125
你不会的 
Which you won't.

735
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,042
对不起.
I'm sorry.

736
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:44,708
不，那些是很好的教训 
No, those were good lessons.

737
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:48,917
你是个好老师，Hendo.
You're a good teacher, Hendo.

738
01:02:51,083 --> 01:02:52,750
我考虑到了这一点 
I took that into account.

739
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:56,417
五十对五十的赔率，对吧？
Fifty-fifty odds, right?

740
01:02:57,792 --> 01:03:01,167
你有没有考虑过我擅长的事情？
Did you ever account for the things I was good at?

741
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,042
在计时器上充电 
Base charge on a timer.

742
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,708
你有一条新消息 
You have one new message.

743
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:16,582
遇见奥斯曼货物 
Meet Ottoman Cargo.

744
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,082
七号机库 他们在等你.
Hangar seven. They're expecting you.

745
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,625
你需要500欧元现金 
You'll need 500 euros in cash.

746
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:37,625
你有一条新消息 
You have one new message.

747
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,625
Fahri咖啡馆，kuvelo ğ lu街 
The Fahri Cafe, Kuveloğlu Street.

748
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,875
我会递给你一本书 
I will pass you a book.

749
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,458
等等 他不是你要找的人 
Wait. He is not who you're looking for.

750
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:43,417
检查你的手机 
Check your phone.

751
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:07,458
不管你出于什么原因，你来这里都是鲁莽的 
It was reckless of you to come here, whatever your reasons.

752
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:09,832
听着，我需要你的帮助 
Listen, I need your help.

753
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,249
不，你无处可去 
No. You have nowhere else to go.

754
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,833
那不是一回事.
That's not the same thing.

755
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,042
我们在购物，好吗？
We're shopping, okay?

756
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:18,667
把你的背包给我.
Give me your backpack.

757
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,917
还有你的帽子.
And your hat.

758
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:30,625
现在你看起来不像美国人了 
Now you look less American.

759
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,500
你想要什么？
What do you want?

760
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:36,832
我妻子被谋杀了 
My wife was murdered.

761
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,292
我知道你妻子的事 
I know about your wife.

762
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,792
巴黎是你吗？
And Paris, that was you?

763
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:45,832
我需要找到其他人 
I need to find the others.

764
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:46,917
不，不在这里 
No. Not here.

765
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:51,124
离这里四个街区有一个停车场，那边 
There is a parking garage four blocks from here, that way.

766
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,624
一楼.
First floor.

767
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,916
去买点东西，然后半小时后在那里见我 
Do some shopping, then meet me there in half an hour.

768
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:57,125
如果你没有被跟踪，我们再谈 
And if you're not followed, we'll talk more.

769
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,833
你多久了？
So, how long has it been you?

770
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:24,667
六年了.
Six years.

771
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,832
我丈夫是中情局的线人.
My husband was a CIA asset.

772
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,416
前克格勃 
Former KGB.

773
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:31,458
他一直在审讯，直到他去世 
He was Inquiline until he died.

774
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:34,625
他从窗户掉了下来 
He fell out of a window.

775
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,124
对不起.
I'm sorry.

776
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,541
从窗户意外坠落
Accidental falls from windows

777
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:41,124
是前克格勃的头号死因 
are the number-one cause of death of former KGB.

778
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,250
你不知道？
You didn't know?

779
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,791
他教我他所做的一切...
He taught me everything he was doing...

780
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:48,708
如何挖掘数据缓存，加密文件 
how to mine data cache, encrypt files.

781
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,333
他死后...
And after he died...

782
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:54,457
嗯，我决定保持和你部门的联系...
well, I decided to keep up my connection to your department...

783
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:56,000
以防我需要帮助 
in case I needed help.

784
01:07:57,375 --> 01:07:59,791
所以我一直以为你是个中年人.
Which is why I always thought you were a middle-aged man.

785
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:01,708
因为你是，首先 
Because you were, to begin with.

786
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,666
你也不是我想象的那样 
You aren't exactly what I pictured, either.

787
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,416
你是怎么想象我的？
How did you picture me?

788
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,333
我不知道.
I don't know.

789
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,417
我猜是中情局先生-带枪的人 
Mr. CIA-man-with-a-gun, I guess.

790
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:15,917
你会帮我吗？
So, you'll help me?

791
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:43,750
它比任何警报系统都要好 
It's better than any alarm system.

792
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,456
这是我住了一个多月的第一个地方...
This is the first place I've stayed in for more than a month...

793
01:08:52,457 --> 01:08:53,917
在过去的三年里 
in the last three years.

794
01:08:56,082 --> 01:08:57,332
我不睡觉 
I don't sleep.

795
01:08:58,082 --> 01:09:00,750
但我只是不想再跑了 
But I just don't want to run anymore.

796
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:05,500
你凭什么认为他们在这里找不到你？
What makes you think they won't find you here?

797
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,082
那天晚上...
For that night...

798
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:11,499
当他们这样做的时候 
when they do.

799
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,581
你真的认为你会用这个击倒俄国人吗？
You really think you're gonna fight off the Russians with that?

800
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:15,831
不适合他们 
It's not for them.

801
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:17,082
是给我的.
It's for me.

802
01:09:20,832 --> 01:09:22,749
这是三个，对吗？
Those are the three, correct?

803
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,791
是啊.
Yeah.

804
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,956
席勒似乎是协调员 
Schiller seems to be the coordinator.

805
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:27,541
主谋.
Ringleader.

806
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,917
但他也是最难描述的 
But he's also the most difficult to profile.

807
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:33,956
据我所知，他们是扩散链中的中间人 
As far as I can tell, they operate as middlemen in the proliferation chain.

808
01:09:33,957 --> 01:09:35,624
就像你给我看的数据一样...
And just like the data you showed me...

809
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:39,041
他们还为摩尔导演的黑色行动寻找雇佣军 
they also source mercenaries for Director Moore's black ops.

810
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:42,581
埃利什提供武器，但他超出了偏执狂 
Ellish sources the weapons, but he's beyond paranoid.

811
01:09:42,582 --> 01:09:45,207
所以，我们必须想办法把他从黑暗中拉出来 
So, we have to find a way to pull him out of the dark.

812
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,416
好吧 也许我可以开始谈话了 
Okay. Perhaps I can start the conversation.

813
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,417
建议我给他一份合同 
Suggest I have a contract for him.

814
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,167
看看他是否会参与 
See if he will engage.

815
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:54,917
好的这位是Mishka Blazhic.
Okay. And this is Mishka Blazhic.

816
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:58,541
他似乎住在莫斯科，但他喜欢继续前进 
He seems to be based in Moscow, but he likes to keep on the move.

817
01:09:58,542 --> 01:10:02,125
享受他的奢侈品 到处旅行头等舱 
Enjoys his luxuries. Travels everywhere first class.

818
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:03,832
他可能是薄弱环节 
He may be the weak link.

819
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,375
甚至在线发布 
Even posts online.

820
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:06,999
这只是上周 
This was just last week.

821
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,624
没有位置，但葡萄园在平地上...
No location, but the vineyard on level ground...

822
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:14,832
而且间距比典型的要宽，所以气候可能更热 
and the spacing is wider than typical, so probably hotter climate.

823
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,957
白垩质土壤 也许是花岗岩 
Chalky soil. Maybe granite.

824
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,666
低沉的太阳照在他酒杯里的酒上 
Low sun hitting the wine in his glass.

825
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:21,375
但是葡萄园会是南北倾斜的...
But the vineyard would be angled north-south...

826
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,167
所以现在是日出 
so it's sunrise.

827
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:27,041
还有这个教堂.建筑看起来像西班牙 
And this church. The architecture looks Spanish.

828
01:10:27,042 --> 01:10:28,249
所以，10月很热 
So, hot in October.

829
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,958
也许是西班牙中部 
Maybe central Spain.

830
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,750
在这里，在倒影中...
And here, in the reflection...

831
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,458
女朋友，也许吧 
girlfriend, maybe.

832
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:40,250
她就在那儿.
And there she is.

833
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,458
亚历山德拉·索洛瓦亚，
Alexandra Solovoya,

834
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,624
谁也喜欢旅行 
who also likes to travel.

835
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:48,708
上周，她乘飞机去了莫斯科马德里

我们需要投射使美国伟大的一切...
We need to project everything that makes America great...

837
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:55,082
但是我们需要公开地做...
but we need to do it openly...

838
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,000
透明地 -我们得假设他还活着.
- and transparently. - We have to assume he's still alive.

839
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,499
他有三个目标

840
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,541
所以，我保证...
And so, I pledge...

841
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:02,249
我们需要找到并盯着他们所有人

 .. 这个机构将值得国家的信任

在我们国家内外，我们将承担责任

844
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:11,832
我看了你的演讲

845
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:12,917
太棒了.
It was excellent.

846
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:17,000
你知道吗，你是我前任第一个向我介绍的人？
You know, you're the first person my predecessor briefed me on?

847
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:20,416
关于你在ISIS上的混蛋，AQ...
About the stick up your ass on ISIS, AQ...

848

伊朗，反恐？

849
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:26,457
即使是现在，在强制退休三年后...
Even now, three years after mandatory retirement...

850
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,958
他们一直在寻找其他方式

851
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:31,125
但现在是家务时间...
But it's housekeeping time...

852
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,417
我需要知道你的立场 
and I need to know where you stand.

853
01:11:34,167 --> 01:11:37,457
听起来你是在暗示我该私了 
Sounds like you're suggesting it's time for me to go private.

854
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:40,250
写一本关于我在公司的时间的书 
Write a neat book about my time with the company.

855
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:44,250
然而，我们在这里，享受这美味的一餐 
Yet here we are, enjoying this lovely meal.

856
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:46,457
那么，为什么？
So, why?

857
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:47,667
哦，拜托.
Oh, please.

858
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,875
我是新来的，但我不傻 
I'm new, but I'm not stupid.

859
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:52,833
我需要你负责 
I need you to be accountable.

860
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,583
对我来说.
To me.

861
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:57,708
别再在沙滩上玩你的黑棋了 
Stop playing your black ops in the sand.

862
01:11:58,042 --> 01:12:00,124
我需要跨越一切 
I need to be across everything.

863
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,958
我的意思是一切 
And I mean everything.

864
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,583
嘿，布莱恩？
Hey, Brian?

865

你能给我再拿一个这种酸面团卷吗？

866

当然，摩尔先生

867

我给你讲个故事.

868
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:22,207
你的前任让我坐在同一张桌子上...
Your predecessor sat me down at this very same table...

869
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,749
他任期不到一周...
no more than a week into his term...

870
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:28,417
给了我几乎完全相同的演讲 
and gave me pretty much this exact same speech.

871
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:30,583
哦，等等.
Oh, wait.

872
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,374
也许是他的前任 
Maybe it was his predecessor.

873
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,832
我不记得了.
I can't remember.

874
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:37,833
不管怎样，我会告诉你我对他们说了什么 
Anyway, I'll tell you what I told them.

875
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,417
我全力支持你 
You have my full support.

876
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:45,167

01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:47,417

兰利也会找到他的

那我们继续追踪他...

890
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:37,875
直到我们有一个明确的领域

894
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:51,667
留意他

这就是他们要派的人

896

干杯，干杯，干杯

897
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:14,083
没有人走路回家 我们滚回家 
Nobody walks home. We roll home.

898
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,458
他是个夜间游泳者 
He's a night swimmer.

899
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,958
他付钱给工作人员为他清理屋顶

900
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,249
 .. 团队的批准...

901
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,207
雄心勃勃的计划获得了绿灯

902
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:49,750
天空池悬浮在70米的地面上方16层 
The sky pool is suspended 16 stories above the ground which is 70 meters.

907
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,208
你可以从那里开枪打他 
You could shoot him from there.

908
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:10,792
你没见过我开枪 
You haven't seen me shoot.

909
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:15,832
我不能在这里说，老板，但为什么埋葬他？
Not for me to say here, boss, but why bury him?

910
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:16,874
为什么不把他卷起来？
Why not just roll him up?

911
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:19,207
我们已经过去了 太臭了 
We're past that. Too big of a stench.

912
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:22,124
听着，他几乎发明了我们一半的监控技术 
Look, he practically invented half of our surveillance tech.

913
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,458
现在，我会找到他...
Now, I will find him...

914
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,541
但是你手上可能会有更大的恶臭
but you might have a bigger stench on your hands

915
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:26,874
如果他再给我们一次失误 
if he gives us the slip again.

916
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:28,625
你不会让这种事发生的.
You won't let that happen.

917
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:34,917
查理·海勒.

918
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:51,917

有道德之类的吗？

922
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,333
是的 还有别的东西 
Yeah. And something else as well.

923

我该走了.
I should move.

926
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:48,750

他一直在跟踪我

930

我给他打了三次钟 
I've clocked him three times.

931
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:05,917
是啊，好吧，哪里有一个，总会有更多

932
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,582
妈的.
Shit.

933
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:12,625

你现在必须离开

939
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,083
Heller你在听我说吗？
Heller, are you listening to me?

940
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,333
不，不，我们按计划去

941
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:56,166
我被允许使用游泳池

943
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,542
有什么问题吗？
Is there a problem?

944
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,917
告诉我在哪里能找到霍斯特·席勒

01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,791
你拿枪指着我妻子的头

告诉我在哪里能找到他

that's been decompressing the air between the sheets of glass beneath you.

If you jump really fast, you might survive the blast.

1116
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:52,125
求你了!
Please!

1117
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:53,917
等等!
Wait!

1118
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:55,958
等等!
Wait!

1119
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:04,999
我们在罗马有一个ping 
We got a ping in Rome.

1120
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,624
那个小混蛋现在在博物馆里？
The little prick is now at a museum?

1121
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:08,958
他不在罗马 
He's not in Rome.

1122
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:10,917
我们在追逐蒸汽 
We're chasing vapors.

1123
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:12,624
怎么做？
How?

1124
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:15,499
因为他们在铲掉劳伦斯·埃利什先生剩下的东西...
Because they're shoveling what's left of Mister Lawrence Ellish...

1125
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,457
在罗马尼亚的泥泞中 
out of the mud in Romania.

1126
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:19,000
他刚在布拉格上了电车 
He just got on a tram in Prague.

1127
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,542
你需要再次睡觉 
You need to sleep again.

1128
01:38:23,042 --> 01:38:24,500
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding me?

1129
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,249
你觉得怎么样，伙计？
What do you think, man?

1130
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,582
只是巧合还是什么？
Just coincidence or what?

1131
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,167
是的，不知何故，我对此表示怀疑 
Yeah, somehow, I doubt that.

1132
01:38:30,792 --> 01:38:32,124
你说呢，也许...
What do you say, maybe...

1133
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:34,957
我们去拿杯低劣的俄罗斯咖啡，嗯？
let's go get us a cup of shitty Russian coffee, huh?

1134
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:36,374
来吧.
Come on.

1135
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:37,791
看看你在这个又大又坏的城市 
Look at you in the big, bad city.

1136
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:39,167
来吧，我们走.
Come on, let's go.

1137
01:38:40,167 --> 01:38:41,875
所以，一只逃跑的兔子，嗯？
So, a rabbit on the run, huh?

1138
01:38:49,125 --> 01:38:50,000
坐下，伙计 
Sit down, man.

1139
01:38:58,083 --> 01:38:59,832
所以你是来杀我的？
So, you're here to kill me?

1140
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:02,041
不，那不是我真正做的 
Nah, that's not really what I do.

1141
01:39:02,042 --> 01:39:05,041
我是说，我可能会让你被杀 你知道，促进它 
I mean, I might set you up to get killed. You know, facilitate it.

1142
01:39:05,042 --> 01:39:06,542
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

1143
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:09,999
我不知道，我的刺客？
I don't know, my assassin?

1144
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,874
你的刺客？是啊，你觉得呢？
Your assassin? Yeah, and what do you think?

1145
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,124
刺客长什么样？
What does an assassin look like?

1146
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:16,582
我是说，可能是任何人，嗯？
I mean, it can kinda be anyone, huh?

1147
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:20,208
我是说，即使是一个小小的书呆子也喜欢在电脑上工作 
I mean, even a slight little nerdy fella likes to work on computers.

1148
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:21,999
他唯一危险的是...
Only thing dangerous about him is...

1149
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,707
他有一个关于修复塞斯纳的梦想...
he's got this dream about rehabbing a Cessna...

1150
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:28,167
只是为了向自己证明他不害怕 
just to fly it around to prove to himself that he's not afraid.

1151
01:39:33,917 --> 01:39:35,250
顺便说一下，这些是杀手 
These are killer, by the way.

1152
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:38,458
我要给你看点东西.
I'm gonna show you something.

1153
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,375
我得把它交给你 我差点没认出你来.
I gotta hand it to you. I almost didn't recognize you.

1154
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,541
我对团队说，“不，不可能 那不是他 ”
I said to the team, "Nah, there's no way. That ain't him."

1155
01:39:47,542 --> 01:39:48,582
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1156
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:50,083
老实说...
Honestly...

1157
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:52,625
只是来救你的命 
just here to save your life.

1158
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,249
你要怎么做？
How are you gonna do that?

1159
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,708
Chuck你杀了三个人.
Chuck, you killed three people.

1160
01:39:58,208 --> 01:40:00,624
你说完了吗？你受够了吗？
Are you done? Have you had enough?

1161
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,499
不，我要扣动扳机的人 我都想要.
No. I want the guy who pulled the trigger. I want 'em all.

1162
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,874
该死，伙计 
Damn, dude.

1163
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,874
嗯，那是相当冷血的 
Well, that's pretty cold-blooded.

1164
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,374
你觉得他们会让你离开俄罗斯吗？
You think they're gonna let you leave Russia?

1165
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:10,291
我是说，这到底是怎么回事？你怎么离开这里？
I mean, how does that even work? How do you leave here?

1166
01:40:10,292 --> 01:40:11,791
你离开这里的唯一方法是在一个盒子里 
The only way you leave here is in a box.

1167
01:40:11,792 --> 01:40:15,874
但是如果你现在和我一起离开这里，我可以帮你 
But if you walk out of here right now with me, I can help you.

1168
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,833
没人派我来.我一个人在这里 
Nobody sent me. I'm here on my own.

1169
01:40:18,958 --> 01:40:20,541
妈的，也许你在这个领域有前途 
Shit, maybe you got a future in this field.

1170
01:40:20,542 --> 01:40:22,374
也许我们可以想出这样的办法，嗯？
Maybe we can figure something out like that, huh?

1171
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:23,582
跟我回家吧.
Just come home with me.

1172
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:25,042
我在外地有前途吗？
I have a future in the field?

1173
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:29,292
嗯，我可以发誓你刚才说我没有未来 
Well, I could have sworn you just said I have no future.

1174
01:40:30,292 --> 01:40:32,957
听着，我不会坐在这里假装我明白你的所作所为 
Look, I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like I understand what's goin' on with you.

1175
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,624
我不知道，好吗？我从未有过这种感觉 
I don't, okay? I've never felt that.

1176
01:40:34,625 --> 01:40:36,167
你的损失，我明白了 
Your loss, I get it.

1177
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:38,707
但你尊敬她 
But you honored her.

1178
01:40:38,708 --> 01:40:39,791
你觉得她想要什么？
What do you think she wants?

1179
01:40:39,792 --> 01:40:42,958
你认为她想让你和这些人一起死在这个国家吗？
You think she wants you to die here in this country with these people?

1180
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:45,167
她会希望你回家的，伙计 
She would want you home, man.

1181
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:47,667
没有 
No.

1182
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:49,500
我不能回家.
I can't go home.

1183
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:51,917
为什么？
Why?

1184
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:55,708
她不在那里.
She's not there.

1185
01:41:03,042 --> 01:41:04,125
好的.
Okay.

1186
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,375
你现在把头转起来，好吗，查克？
You keep your head on a swivel now, okay, Chuck?

1187
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:16,541
先生，对不起 
Sir, I'm sorry.

1188
01:42:16,542 --> 01:42:17,958
你会说英语吗？
Do you speak English?

1189
01:42:19,667 --> 01:42:21,541
对不起，先生 对不起 
Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

1190
01:42:21,542 --> 01:42:23,125
有两个人.
There were two men.

1191
01:42:24,042 --> 01:42:26,208
和你在卡车上 
With you on a truck.

1192
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:34,041
不是很令人印象深刻，是吗？
It's not very impressive, is it?

1193
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:36,958
放在舱口下的货物附近？
Placed near the cargo you have below those hatches?

1194
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:40,833
我想我甚至可能觉得有点被侮辱了 
I think I might even feel a little insulted.

1195
01:44:42,958 --> 01:44:44,875
-谁在追我？-我.
- Who's coming after me? - Me.

1196
01:44:45,542 --> 01:44:47,167
我 我在追你 
Me. I'm coming after you.

1197
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:50,000
谁在管理你？
And who is running you?

1198
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:54,416
什么，你害怕摩尔主任最终决定退出吗？
What, are you afraid Director Moore has finally decided to call it quits?

1199
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:55,833
你关机了吗？
Have you shut down?

1200
01:44:56,625 --> 01:44:58,332
不管你认为你知道什么...
Whatever you think you know...

1201
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:00,999
我知道摩尔和凯勒雇了你和你的衣服...
I know Moore and Caleb hire you and your outfit...

1202
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,667
为他们进行秘密行动 我有证据.
to carry out black ops for them. I have proof.

1203
01:45:04,167 --> 01:45:09,292
但是... 这不是问题所在，是吗？
But... that's not what this is about, is it?

1204
01:45:10,667 --> 01:45:11,500
没有 
No.

1205
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,000
我来这里是为了面对杀害我妻子的凶手 
I came here to face my wife's killer.

1206
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:20,875
看着他的眼睛 
To look him in the eyes.

1207
01:45:22,042 --> 01:45:24,333
告诉他她很重要 
And tell him she mattered.

1208
01:45:26,542 --> 01:45:28,167
莎拉很重要 
Sarah mattered.

1209
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:31,583
所以，只有你 
So, it is just you.

1210
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:37,666
Gretchen, Blazhic, Ellish...
Gretchen, Blazhic, Ellish...

1211
01:45:37,667 --> 01:45:40,249
他们派来抓你的人 
the men that they sent after you.

1212
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:43,582
整件事都是你的报复？
This whole thing is all your revenge?

1213
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:44,917
查理的复仇？
Charlie's revenge?

1214
01:45:50,458 --> 01:45:51,542
求你了.
Please.

1215
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,167
我记得你的妻子 
I remember your wife.

1216
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,333
她取代了别人的位置 
She took the place of someone else.

1217
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:11,375
非常非常勇敢 
It's very, very brave.

1218
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,042
我很抱歉她死了 
I am sorry she died.

1219
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:17,082
但那是...
But it was...

1220
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:18,167
必要的 
necessary.

1221
01:46:18,667 --> 01:46:20,750
警察封锁了我们的出口 
The police had blocked our exit.

1222
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:27,500
我必须证明如果他们不允许我们离开会发生什么 
I had to demonstrate what would happen if they did not allow us to leave.

1223
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,375
就这样？
That's it?

1224
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:33,375
“必要”？
"Necessary"?

1225
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:36,874
你对我来说没什么不同...
You are not so different to me...

1226
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:41,000
杀死这些人是为了找到你来这里的路 
killing these people to find your way here to me.

1227
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,000
这让你感觉好些了吗？
Has it made you feel better?

1228
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:47,000
要杀了你我才知道.
I won't know till I've killed you.

1229
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:51,875
是...
It was...

1230
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:55,416
-一瞬间.你的妻子.-不，不是.
- an instant. Your wife. - No, it wasn't.

1231
01:46:55,417 --> 01:46:57,291
然而你却折磨我的同事...
Yet you tortured my colleagues...

1232
01:46:57,292 --> 01:46:59,791
把一个人扔下16层楼...
dropped a man 16 stories...

1233
01:46:59,792 --> 01:47:03,332
把一个女人闷死在一个上锁的房间里 
suffocated a woman in a locked chamber.

1234
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:05,874
你让他们都手无寸铁 
You had them all unarmed, defenseless.

1235
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:10,374
从远处策划了你精心策划的谋杀 
Staged your elaborate murders from a distance.

1236
01:47:10,375 --> 01:47:12,125
你知道为什么吗？
And you know why?

1237
01:47:15,042 --> 01:47:16,208
我知道.
I do.

1238
01:47:17,583 --> 01:47:21,625
因为很难近距离生活 
Because it's hard to take a life up close.

1239
01:47:22,375 --> 01:47:26,750
你每次都会失去一些东西 
You lose something each time.

1240
01:47:27,125 --> 01:47:30,292
你永远无法找回的自己 
A piece of yourself you cannot get back ever.

1241
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:35,541
你已经失去了很多 
And you've lost so much already.

1242
01:47:35,542 --> 01:47:39,374
所以，你必须给他们一个逃脱老鼠陷阱的机会...
So, you had to give them a chance to escape the mouse trap...

1243
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:42,417
跑得足够快 
to run just fast enough.

1244
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:48,666
因为那样你就可以告诉自己手上没有血迹 
Because then you can tell yourself there's no blood on your hands.

1245
01:47:48,667 --> 01:47:52,041
但并不意味着你软弱 
But doesn't mean you're weak.

1246
01:47:52,042 --> 01:47:56,292
只是意味着你不是真正的杀手 
Just means you are not truly a killer.

1247
01:47:59,417 --> 01:48:00,833
不相信我？
Don't believe me?

1248
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:16,083
说吧.
Go ahead.

1249
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:19,917
你是来杀我的.拿去吧.你会看到的.
You're here to kill me. Take it. You'll see.

1250
01:48:21,792 --> 01:48:23,750
这不是诡计.给你.
It's not a trick. Here.

1251
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,083
那好吧.
All right, then.

1252
01:48:30,792 --> 01:48:32,667
面对面地结束它 
End it face to face.

1253
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:40,000
我的一个朋友曾经告诉我，我永远无法扣动扳机 
A friend of mine once told me I'd never be able to pull the trigger.

1254
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:46,000
但他也说我永远不会杀人 
But he also said I'd never be able to kill.

1255
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:28,208
就是这样.
There it is.

1256
01:49:31,375 --> 01:49:33,083
这就是我来这里的目的 
That's what I came here for.

1257
01:49:34,792 --> 01:49:36,875
平衡天平 
To balance the scales.

1258
01:49:40,042 --> 01:49:43,750
让你感受到她那一刻的感受 
To make you feel what she felt in that moment.

1259
01:49:45,125 --> 01:49:46,833
在你杀了她之前.
Before you killed her.

1260
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:26,708
我带我们走了弯路 
I've taken us on a detour.

1261
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,374
胡说.
Bullshit.

1262
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,708
我已经控制了你的船 
I've taken control of your boat.

1263
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,125
我们刚刚到达芬兰水域 
We've just reached Finnish waters.

1264
01:50:36,875 --> 01:50:38,542
这是不可能的 
That is not possible.

1265
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:41,249
这艘船是个金库.
This ship is a vault.

1266
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:43,499
你自己的中情局坚持要这么做 
Your own CIA insisted upon it.

1267
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,417
使用我写的加密 
Using encryption I wrote.

1268
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:48,041
听着，都是从我的酒店房间跑出来的 
Look, it's all running from my hotel room.

1269
01:50:48,042 --> 01:50:51,750
这两个人可能打碎了我的手机，但他们抓住了他们的手机...
These two may have smashed my phone, but they held on to theirs...

1270
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:53,416
还有我的手表.
and my watch.

1271
01:50:53,417 --> 01:50:56,167
所以，我是发射器，而你...
So, I'm the transmitter and you...

1272
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:58,292
你邀请我进来的.
you invited me in.

1273
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:02,167
我只需要你说话，只要把我们带到这里 
I just needed you to talk as long as it took to get us here.

1274
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,833
那将是芬兰海军和国际刑警组织 
That would be the Finnish Navy and Interpol.

1275
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:10,708
我给了他们这个位置 
I gave them this location.

1276
01:51:14,083 --> 01:51:16,291
我们正在登上你的船 
We are boarding your boat.

1277
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:20,083
我们是按照国际法行事的 
We are acting in accordance with international law.

1278
01:51:20,792 --> 01:51:23,458
你被逮捕了.
You are being placed under arrest.

1279
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:29,917
退下，退下!
Stand down, stand down!

1280
01:51:31,417 --> 01:51:32,583
趴下 
Down.

1281
01:51:34,917 --> 01:51:35,832
海勒.
Heller.

1282
01:51:35,833 --> 01:51:37,125
查理·海勒.
Charlie Heller.

1283
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:49,250
当我担任这个角色时...
When I took up this role...

1284
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:53,207
我向在这栋楼里工作的每个人都说清楚了...
I made it clear to everyone who works in this building...

1285
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:58,041
即使我们的工作有时在黑暗的角落里进行...
that even though our work sometimes goes on in dark corners...

1286
01:52:58,042 --> 01:52:59,499
这不是借口...
that is no excuse...

1287
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:03,958
让黑暗掩盖我们的目标或方法 
to allow darkness to obscure our objectives or our methods.

1288
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:10,207
所以，我非常难过地告诉你，信息已经浮出水面...
So, I'm deeply saddened to have to tell you that information has surfaced...

1289
01:53:10,208 --> 01:53:15,125
这牵涉到该机构的高级成员执行流氓任务...
that implicates senior members of this agency in carrying out rogue missions...

1290
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:20,582
这使我们自己的运营商和代理商的安全面临巨大风险 
which put the safety of our own operators and agents we work with at great risk.

1291
01:53:20,583 --> 01:53:21,750
先生们.
Gentlemen.

1292
01:53:22,167 --> 01:53:25,292
赢得战争的代价不能成为我们的荣誉 
The cost of winning the war cannot be our honor.

1293
01:53:25,958 --> 01:53:28,042
这些行动没有受到制裁 
Those operations were not sanctioned.

1294
01:53:28,792 --> 01:53:30,625
他们是非法的 
They were illegal.

1295
01:53:30,958 --> 01:53:33,708
这些人将面临法律的全部力量 
And those individuals will face the full force of the law.

1296
01:53:34,917 --> 01:53:36,417
我现在将回答问题 
I will now take questions.

1297
01:53:36,833 --> 01:53:37,750
华盛顿邮报 
Washington Post.

1298
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:39,749
我知道这些逮捕与...
I understand these arrests are linked to...

1299
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:42,749
去年在欧洲城市发生了一系列杀戮事件 
a series of killings in European cities last year.

1300
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,291
中情局参与了这些行动吗？
Was the CIA involved in those operations?

1301
01:53:45,292 --> 01:53:47,874
你不会指望我回答这个问题 
You would not expect me to answer that.

1302
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:51,582
NBC 举报人是否仍受雇于该机构？
NBC. Is the whistleblower still employed by the agency?

1303
01:53:51,583 --> 01:53:54,167
我可以确认警官是安全的 
I can confirm that the officer is safe.

1304
01:53:54,583 --> 01:53:57,042
他们将继续为该机构服务 
And that they will continue to serve with the agency.

1305
01:54:40,875 --> 01:54:42,458
现在谁是Uber司机？
Who's the Uber driver now?

1306
01:54:44,333 --> 01:54:46,167
你一定快没生命了 
You must be running out of lives.

1307
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,750
你总是让我吃惊，查理 
And you keep on surprising me, Charlie.

1308
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:51,874
你教我的一切 
Everything you taught me.

1309
01:54:51,875 --> 01:54:55,291
不，不 你做了什么，你变成了什么...
No, no. What you've done, what you've become...

1310
01:54:55,292 --> 01:54:56,750
不能教这个 
can't teach that.

1311
01:54:58,417 --> 01:55:00,916
我想我只是突然看到需要做什么 
I guess I just suddenly saw what needed doing.

1312
01:55:00,917 --> 01:55:02,000
是啊.
Yeah.

1313
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:04,417
当没有其他人做的时候 
When no one else did.

1314
01:55:05,667 --> 01:55:06,667
谢谢 
Thank you.

1315
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,708
再见，查理 
See you around, Charlie.
