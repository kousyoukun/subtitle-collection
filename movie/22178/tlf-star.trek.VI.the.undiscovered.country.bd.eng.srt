1
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,030
Stardate 9521.6.

2
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,240
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior. Hikaru Sulu commanding.

3
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,280
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel -

4
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,290
- cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.

5
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,520
We're heading home under full impulse power.

6
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,390
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.

7
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,940
According to this,we've completed our survey of the entire sector.

8
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,310
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.

9
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,390
Visual!

10
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,920
My¡­ God!

11
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,450
Shields. Shields!

12
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,510
She's not answering her helm.

13
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,610
Starboard thrusters. Turn her into the wave.

14
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,310
Go to impulse power.

15
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,650
- Damage report. - Checking all systems.

16
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,330
- That was no meteor shower. - Negative,sir.

17
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,200
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.

18
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,680
Location¡­ It's Praxis,sir. It's a Klingon moon.

19
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,870
Praxis is their key energy production facility.

20
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,550
Send to Klingon High Command. ¡°This is Excelsior,a Federation Starship.¡±

21
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,350
¡°We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.¡±

22
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,900
- ¡°Do you require assistance?¡± - Aye,sir.

23
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,900
- Mr Vultane,any more data? - I've confirmed Praxis' location,but¡­

24
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,870
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence. - On screen.

25
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,470
- Magnify. - Computer enhancement.

26
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,310
- Praxis? - What's left of it,sir.

27
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,980
Captain,I'm getting a message from Praxis.

28
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,320
Let's have it.

29
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,400
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.

30
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,070
There has been an incident on Praxis.

31
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,010
However,everything is under control. We have no need for assistance.

32
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,610
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.

33
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,620
This transmission ends now.

34
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,430
- An incident? - Do we report this,sir?

35
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,190
Are you kidding?

36
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,440
- What are we doing here? - Maybe it's a retirement party.

37
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,510
That suits me. I just bought a boat.

38
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,510
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.

39
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,740
- Isn't this just for top brass? - Where is Sulu?

40
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,120
Captain Sulu? On assignment. Where's Spock?

41
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,190
This briefing is classified. Ladies and gentlemen,the C-in-C.

42
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,140
As you were.

43
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,040
I'll break this information down succinctly.

44
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,650
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.

45
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,360
For full details,I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation Special Envoy.

46
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,340
Good morning.

47
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:08,640
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.

48
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,580
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.

49
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,550
The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their ozone.

50
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,790
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.

51
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,860
Due to their enormous military budget -

52
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,700
- the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.

53
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,470
Last month,at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador,-

54
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,600
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.

55
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,550
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.

56
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,590
Negotiations for what?

57
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,560
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone.

58
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,890
An end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.

59
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,700
Bill,are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?

60
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,400
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected,but¡­

61
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,940
I must protest!

62
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,380
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.

63
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,410
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.

64
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,350
If we dismantle the fleet,-

65
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,680
- we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.

66
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,590
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.

67
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,590
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.

68
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,530
- Sir¡­ - Captain Kirk?

69
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,800
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.

70
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,210
I agree with Admiral Cartwright. This is a terrifying idea.

71
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,710
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative,-

72
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,150
- lest more conservative elements persuade his empire -

73
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,810
- that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.

74
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,320
You,Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.

75
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,130
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth -

76
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,170
- and to escort him safely through Federation space.

77
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,070
Me?

78
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,010
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself,-

79
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,810
- but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.

80
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,310
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.

81
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,150
You have personally vouched¡­?

82
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,890
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy,Captain.

83
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,160
- A full Ambassador is better equipped¡­ - If there's no further business¡­

84
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,770
¡­I wish you and your crew Godspeed. Thank you,ladies and gentlemen.

85
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,700
I remind you this meeting is classified.

86
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,610
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not,Jim.

87
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,910
I wouldn't.

88
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,110
We volunteered?

89
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,290
There's an old Vulcan proverb. ¡°Only Nixon could go to China.¡±

90
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,300
How could you vouch for me?

91
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,370
- That's arrogant presumption. - My father requested that I open¡­

92
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,980
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador,but you know how I feel.

93
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,270
- They're animals. - Jim¡­

94
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,590
- There is an historic opportunity here. - Don't believe them! Don't trust them.

95
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,950
- They're dying. - Let them die.

96
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,300
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?

97
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,130
We've done our bit for king and country.

98
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,060
You should have trusted me.

99
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,080
Control,this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock. Over.

100
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:09,850
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.

101
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,460
- Captain on the bridge! - As you were. Lieutenant¡­?

102
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,330
Val'eris,sir. We were told you needed a helmsman,so I volunteered.

103
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,270
It is agreeable to see you again.

104
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,970
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.

105
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,480
- You must be very proud. - I don't believe so,sir.

106
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,170
She's a Vulcan,alright.

107
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,340
Let's get this over with. Departure stations.

108
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,680
- Scotty? Did you find the engine room? - Right where I left it.

109
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,690
Stand by. Uhura,get me the dock master.

110
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,560
Control tower reading,sir.

111
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,530
Control,this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.

112
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,570
This is Control. Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.

113
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,200
- Clear all moorings. - Awaiting port gates from this mark.

114
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,240
- All lines clear. - Aft thrusters.

115
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,780
Thank you,Lieutenant. 1 quarter impulse power.

116
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:17,650
Captain,regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.

117
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,190
Jim¡­

118
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,730
You heard the order,Lieutenant.

119
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,690
Aye,sir.

120
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,100
Captain's log. Stardate 9522.6.

121
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,970
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.

122
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,580
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.

123
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,520
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit -

124
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,250
- is problematic,at best.

125
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,440
Spock says this could be an historic occasion. I'd like to believe him.

126
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,200
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?

127
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,610
- Sorry. - You could have knocked.

128
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,150
We are almost at the rendezvous,sir. I thought that you would like to know.

129
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,990
Permission to speak freely,sir. It is an honour to serve with you.

130
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,730
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.

131
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,530
I've always wanted to try that.

132
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,350
You've done well,Val'eris.

133
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,580
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.

134
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,290
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.

135
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,430
I do not understand this representation.

136
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,270
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.

137
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,910
¡°The expulsion from Paradise.¡±

138
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,350
- Why keep it in your quarters? - To remind me that all things end.

139
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,820
It is of endings that I wish to speak.

140
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,420
Sir,I address you as a kindred intellect.

141
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,300
Do you not recognise¡­

142
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,270
¡­that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?

143
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,170
History is replete with turning points. You must have faith.

144
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,540
- Faith? - The universe will unfold as it should.

145
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,520
- Is that logical? Surely we must¡­ - Logic,logic,logic.

146
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,490
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris. Not the end.

147
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,370
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.

148
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,570
Nature abhors a vacuum.

149
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,370
I intend you to replace me.

150
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,650
I could only succeed you,sir.

151
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,200
Now hear this. All officers to the bridge.

152
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,670
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow. All Officers to the bridge.

153
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,410
Captain on the bridge!

154
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,760
Shall we raise our shields,Captain?

155
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,810
I've never been this close.

156
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,210
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.

157
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,390
- Uhura,hailing frequencies. - Aye,sir.

158
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,860
Right standard rudder. Bring us alongside.

159
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,960
Right standard rudder. Z plus 5 degrees.

160
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,930
Channel is open,Captain.

161
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,400
This is the Starship Enterprise. Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

162
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,740
This is Kronos One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.

163
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,290
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.

164
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,010
Thank you.

165
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,360
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise -

166
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,660
- as guests of the United Federation of Planets?

167
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,700
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.

168
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,610
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.

169
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,180
I shall look forward to that.

170
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,680
I hope you're happy.

171
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,620
Captain! There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.

172
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,060
It might make the evening pass more¡­ smoothly.

173
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,930
Officer thinking,Lieutenant.

174
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,290
Guess who's coming to dinner.

175
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,080
Energize.

176
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,810
- Chancellor Gorkon. - Captain Kirk.

177
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,580
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.

178
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,420
Captain,face to face at last. You have my thanks.

179
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,760
Chancellor.

180
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,130
Gentlemen.

181
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,330
This is my daughter,Azetbur¡­

182
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,200
My military advisor,Brigadier Kerla¡­

183
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,210
¡­and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.

184
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,610
I have so wanted to meet you,Captain.

185
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,360
- I'm not sure how to take that. - Sincere admiration,Kirk.

186
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,720
From one warrior to another.

187
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,000
Right¡­

188
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,840
This way. You might enjoy a brief tour.

189
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,720
- They all look alike. - What about that smell?

190
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,800
You know only top of the line models can even talk¡­

191
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,360
- You men have work? - Yes,ma'am.

192
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,560
Then snap to it.

193
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,050
I offer a toast.

194
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,880
The undiscovered country.

195
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,490
- The future. - The undiscovered country.

196
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,890
Hamlet,act 3,scene 1.

197
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:54,260
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.

198
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,340
Captain Kirk. I thought Romulan ale was illegal.

199
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,470
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.

200
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,580
To you,Chancellor Gorkon. One of the architects of our future.

201
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,250
Chancellor!

202
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,930
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.

203
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:34,200
Tell me,Captain Kirk. Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?

204
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:44,550
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.

205
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,120
I wouldn't dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always been¡­

206
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:57,190
There's no need to mince words. In space,all warriors are cold warriors.

207
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,830
General, are you fond of¡­ Shakespeare?

208
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,470
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.

209
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,370
¡°Inalien¡­¡± If you could only hear yourselves.

210
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,320
¡°Human rights.¡± Why,the very name is racist.

211
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,360
The Federation is a ¡°homo sapiens only¡± club.

212
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,860
Present company excepted,of course.

213
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:34,090
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.

214
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,720
That's not true. No!

215
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,710
¡°To be or not to be¡±¡­That is the question which preoccupies our people.

216
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,280
- We need breathing room. - Earth. Hitler,1938.

217
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,380
I beg your pardon?

218
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,390
Well¡­

219
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,590
I see we have a long way to go.

220
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,460
We must do this again sometime.

221
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,440
You don't trust me,do you? I don't blame you.

222
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,670
If there is to be a brave new world,-

223
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,840
- our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.

224
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,080
- Captain Spock. - Chancellor. Madam.

225
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,280
Captain.

226
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,060
Well,most kind.

227
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,790
Parting is such sweet sorrow. Hmm,Captain?

228
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,630
¡°Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?¡±

229
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,930
Thank God!

230
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,730
- Did you see the way they ate? - Terrible table manners.

231
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,100
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.

232
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,940
I'm going to sleep this off. Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?

233
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,920
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.

234
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:55,130
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.

235
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,900
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.

236
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,140
To the galley - Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.

237
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,220
Captain Kirk,will you please join me on the bridge? Captain Kirk?

238
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,590
- Captain. - What is it?

239
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,630
- I find this curious. - Spock,I'm really tired.

240
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,710
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.

241
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,040
- Where? - It appears to emanate from us.

242
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,340
The Enterprise?

243
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:43,950
Val'eris,do you know anything about a radiation surge? Chekov?

244
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,850
Only the size of my head.

245
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,430
I know what you mean.

246
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,830
- What's happened? - We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.

247
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,280
Torpedo room! Please confirm,have we fired?

248
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,980
- Uhura,monitor. - Aye,sir.

249
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,720
- Direct hit. - Confirmed,sir.

250
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,480
This is the bridge. Do you read me?

251
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,150
- Did we fire those torpedoes? - Negative. We're still fully loaded.

252
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,250
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.

253
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,990
- Hailing frequencies. - Aye,sir.

254
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,660
Kronos One,this is Enterprise. Do you read?

255
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:48,230
It's very hard to make out. There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.

256
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,970
- She's still listing. - She's spinning out of control.

257
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,780
Have you not a shred of decency in you,Kirk?

258
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,820
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.

259
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,610
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.

260
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,190
- We haven't fired. - Captain¡­

261
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,060
According to our data banks, we have. Twice¡­

262
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,130
Captain,they're coming about.

263
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,840
- They're preparing to fire. - Shields up,Captain?

264
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,540
- Captain,our shields. - Shields up,Captain?

265
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,280
Signal our surrender.

266
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,890
We surrender!

267
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,720
- This is Enterprise. We surrender. - If they fire,with our shields down¡­

268
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,300
¡­we will not be able to respond. - Repeat,Enterprise surrenders.

269
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,540
- Are we firing torpedoes? - I wish I knew.

270
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,110
- I'm going aboard. Spock,take the con. - I involved you,I will go.

271
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,510
No,I'll go. We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.

272
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,590
I'm going too,they may need a doctor.

273
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,350
Uhura,tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.

274
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,990
- Have you lost your mind?! - I don't understand what's happened.

275
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,100
We're here to help.

276
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,900
Follow me.

277
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,130
- Chancellor Gorkon. - My God! What has happened here?

278
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,860
- You dare to feign ignorance? - What happened?

279
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,600
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field -

280
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,810
- and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.

281
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,320
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon? - We were until this disgrace.

282
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,980
Then for God's sake,let me help.

283
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,430
I've got a pulse - we can move him. I need light. Put him on the table.

284
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,680
Hold him! Hold him while I stabilize him.

285
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,380
I said hold him!

286
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,860
Sweet Jesus.

287
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,160
- Can you¡­? - I don't even know his anatomy.

288
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,210
- His wounds are not closing. - He's killing him!

289
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,580
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.

290
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,780
Come on,dammit! Come on!

291
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,790
He's not responding.

292
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,490
Don't let it end this way,Captain.

293
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,660
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law¡­

294
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,230
¡­I'm placing you under arrest.

295
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,930
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.

296
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,130
He tried to save him.

297
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,050
They've been arrested.

298
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,050
Mr Spock,we've got to do something.

299
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,450
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.

300
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:45,960
Commander Uhura,notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.

301
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,500
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.

302
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:55,130
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.

303
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,740
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.

304
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,140
- How did you achieve this? - Time is precious.

305
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,680
We must piece together what happened here tonight.

306
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,480
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.

307
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,350
- No way! - I sympathize,but we need evidence.

308
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,650
Please accompany me.

309
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,220
And if we cannot piece together what happened? What then,sir?

310
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,860
In that case,Mr Chekov,it resides in the purview of the diplomats.

311
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,740
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!

312
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,640
The result of an unprovoked attack -

313
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:40,910
- while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!

314
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,420
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.

315
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,720
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.

316
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:55,160
- None of these facts are in dispute. - I have ordered an investigation.

317
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,300
- In the meantime¡­ - In the meantime¡­

318
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:05,000
¡­we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.

319
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,140
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.

320
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,010
Out of the question. Ambassador Sarek,can we get them extradited?

321
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,620
Mr President,I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter,-

322
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,230
- but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.

323
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,890
What is the position of the Romulan government?

324
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,700
I must concur with my colleagues.

325
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:38,400
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.

326
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,100
Mr President. I don't know what to believe.

327
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,250
I'm waiting for your answer,sir.

328
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,690
This President is not above the law.

329
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:05,200
- We're to report back at once. - We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.

330
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,870
400 years ago,on Earth,workers who felt their livelihood threatened -

331
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:16,610
- flung their wooden shoes called ¡°sabots¡± into the machines to stop them.

332
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,560
Hence the word ¡°sabotage¡±.

333
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,260
We experience technical malfunction. All back-up systems inoperative.

334
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,870
Excellent. I mean¡­ too bad.

335
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:41,170
Mr President,I have been named chancellor in my father's place.

336
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,580
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.

337
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,780
I assure you that this shameful deed will not¡­

338
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,260
Let us come to the point. You want this conference to go forward.

339
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,830
I will attend in one week, on one condition.

340
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,490
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.

341
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,770
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.

342
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,070
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.

343
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,310
After recent events,you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.

344
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,820
And in the interests of security,let us keep the location secret for now.

345
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,320
As you wish,Madam Chancellor.

346
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,190
Your father was killed for what he wanted.

347
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,560
The peace process will go forward.

348
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,900
Kirk¡­

349
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,980
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

350
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,080
It's a damn show trial.

351
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,840
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.

352
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,880
The Chancellor and his advisors¡­

353
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:16,780
¡­having been lulled into a false sense of security -

354
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,540
- by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel -

355
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,880
- at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.

356
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,580
Call your first witness.

357
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,290
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.

358
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,760
I was weightless and couldn't function.

359
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,900
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.

360
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,730
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.

361
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,070
That remark is speculative. I move that it be stricken.

362
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,300
We're interested in facts,not theories.

363
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,220
If the gravitational unit was not functioning,how could they walk?

364
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,750
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.

365
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,990
- Gravity boots¡­? - Dr. McCoy.

366
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,000
Would you be so good as to tell me -

367
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,190
- what is your current medical status?

368
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,130
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.

369
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,440
You have a singular wit,Doctor.

370
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:29,210
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.

371
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,290
In three months I stand down.

372
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,590
You know¡­

373
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,860
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale -

374
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,470
- in the officers mess on the night in question.

375
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,700
- Objection. - Sustained.

376
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,430
We all did. All of us. That doesn't mean¡­

377
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:56,310
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?

378
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,850
Barely.

379
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,850
Now be careful,Doctor. Have you ever in your past -

380
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,290
- saved patients as barely alive as he?

381
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,620
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.

382
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,090
- I see. - You where there.

383
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:18,570
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask,do your hands shake?

384
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,800
- Objection! - I was nervous.

385
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,140
No. You were incompetent.

386
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,110
You were incompetent!

387
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,480
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.

388
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:41,490
- The court will have to determine. - My God,man. I tried to save him!

389
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,690
I tried to save him.

390
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,230
I was desperate to save him.

391
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,900
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.

392
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,910
The witness is excused.

393
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,950
There we have it,citizens. We have established the particulars of the crime.

394
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,850
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.

395
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:16,430
James Tiberius Kirk.

396
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,960
What would your favourite author say, Captain?

397
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:26,590
¡°Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings.¡±

398
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,110
Tell us your sad story,Kirk.

399
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,370
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.

400
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,640
- That's not true. - Objection!

401
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,720
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.

402
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:49,120
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.

403
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,100
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.

404
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:58,670
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.

405
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,670
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.

406
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,440
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.

407
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,850
Are those your words?

408
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:24,520
Those words were spoken by me.

409
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,500
Objection! My client's political views are not on trial.

410
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:38,540
On the contrary. Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.

411
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:44,980
His record shows him to be an insubordinate,unprincipled opportunist -

412
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,520
- with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.

413
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,050
Continue.

414
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,590
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral -

415
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,700
- and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.

416
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:04,730
Do you deny being demoted for these charges. Answer me now!

417
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,570
- I cannot deny it. - You were demoted?

418
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,970
- For insubordination? - On occasion,I have disobeyed orders.

419
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,140
Were you obeying or disobeying orders -

420
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,220
- when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?

421
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,110
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.

422
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:26,090
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?

423
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,520
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?

424
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,390
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.

425
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:38,730
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship,-

426
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,030
- you are responsible for the actions of your men?

427
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,910
I am.

428
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:53,480
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination¡­

429
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,590
- They're setting us up. Your Honours! - Do not answer.

430
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,250
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.

431
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,660
As Captain¡­

432
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,370
¡­I'm responsible for the crew under my command.

433
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,880
Your Honours,the state rests.

434
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,080
Send to Commander Enterprise.

435
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,310
¡°We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu,U.S.S. Excelsior.¡±

436
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:39,160
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.

437
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,040
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.

438
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,980
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.

439
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,710
So noted.

440
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,950
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.

441
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,190
In the interest of fostering amity -

442
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:16,600
- for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.

443
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,480
It is the judgement of this court -

444
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,340
- that,without possibility of reprieve or parole,-

445
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:38,460
- you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines -

446
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,960
- on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.

447
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:48,570
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.

448
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,570
Rura Penthe!

449
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:05,050
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.

450
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,580
Better to kill them now and get it over with.

451
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:34,180
Lieutenant. The torpedo hit once again,please.

452
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,110
Hold.

453
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,780
It is Enterprise. We fired.

454
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,620
That is not possible! All weapons visually accounted for,sir.

455
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,630
An ancestor of mine maintained -

456
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,700
- that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.

457
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:03,070
What does that mean?

458
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,410
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes,someone else did.

459
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,540
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.

460
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,520
- There was a neutron surge. - Not from us.

461
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:21,630
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.

462
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:25,060
- Kronos One? - Too far away.

463
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:29,630
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.

464
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:35,070
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.

465
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,600
Would they?

466
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,850
- A Bird of Prey? - A Bird of Prey.

467
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:51,750
- Cloaked? - They can't fire when they're cloaked.

468
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,450
All things being equal,I would agree.

469
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:59,760
However,things are not equal. This one can.

470
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,430
- We must inform Starfleet Command. - Of what?

471
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,300
A new weapon that's invisible? They'll call us raving lunatics.

472
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:13,240
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.

473
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,640
And they would be correct. We have no evidence.

474
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,050
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.

475
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,120
Assuming you're right. Why would they fire on their own President?

476
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,190
Indeed.

477
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,490
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.

478
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,860
I do not understand. If there was a ship underneath us -

479
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:40,330
- surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel,not Enterprise.

480
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:43,840
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.

481
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:48,070
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.

482
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,440
If we did,the killers are here.

483
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:55,110
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.

484
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:59,920
In either case, what we are looking for is here.

485
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,650
- What are we looking for,sir? - Lieutenant.

486
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,460
Two pairs of gravity boots.

1
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,760
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.

2
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:25,240
There is no stockades,no guard tower,no electronic frontier.

3
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,840
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.

4
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:35,350
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.

5
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,120
On the surface,nothing can survive.

6
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,320
Work well,and you will be treated well.

7
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,270
Work badly,and you will die.

8
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,950
Oh,my God!

9
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,460
The universal translator has been confiscated.

10
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,700
I'm sorry¡­?

11
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,200
He's definitely on about something,Jim.

12
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,850
If this is your spot,we'll move on.

13
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,850
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.

14
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,280
- He's got it. - And your coat.

15
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,480
I'm afraid not. It wouldn't fit.

16
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:16,370
- Thanks. - This will help keep you warm.

17
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:23,640
- I'm Martia. You're Kirk and McCoy. - How did you know that?

18
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,150
We don't get many presidential assassins.

19
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,090
- We didn't kill Gorkon. - Of course not.

20
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,520
- But there's a reward for your death. - That figures.

21
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,190
We've been set up.

22
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,660
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.

23
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,730
- Any progress? - None.

24
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:54,210
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere,but the killers may still be among them.

25
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,840
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.

26
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,950
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?

27
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:06,320
Logic must give way to physics. Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.

28
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:10,930
Without the boots,they would have floated off the transporter pads.

29
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,530
Why not simply vaporize them?

30
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,540
Like this?

31
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:31,310
As you know,no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.

32
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,820
Suppose,when they returned,they threw the boots into the refuse.

33
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,590
I'm having the refuse searched.

34
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,830
If I'm correct,those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.

35
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,940
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.

36
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,070
Those boots are here. Somewhere.

37
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:59,650
- Did someone fire off a phaser? - It's alright. It's nothing.

38
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:04,220
Mr Spock,Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.

39
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,620
- Who fired the¡­ - Ah,Mr Scott.

40
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:12,280
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive. How long do you need for repair?

41
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,360
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.

42
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:21,800
If we return to space dock,the killers can dispose of their footwear -

43
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:26,070
- and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.

44
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,640
- It could take weeks. - Thank you.

45
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:32,870
Val'eris,inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.

46
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,020
- A lie? - An error.

47
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,990
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.

48
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,180
Yes,at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.

49
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:51,130
But if I know the Captain,he is deep into planning his escape.

50
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,390
You've got him where you want him,Jim!

51
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:11,500
- Are you alright? - I think so.

52
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,810
- They'll respect you now. - I was lucky that thing had knees.

53
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,470
That was not his knee.

54
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,750
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place,Captain.

55
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,480
Anything you want to tell me?

56
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:31,430
See what you can do for him. Let him know we're not holding a grudge.

57
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,470
Suppose he's holding a grudge?

58
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:42,270
When whoever it is makes their move,you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

59
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:49,280
- Do you want to get out of here? - There's got to be a way.

60
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,470
Three months before retirement. What a way to finish.

61
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,810
- We're not finished. - Speak for yourself.

62
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,570
One day,one night¡­ Kobayashi Maru!

63
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:27,210
Bones! Are you afraid of the future?

64
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:32,190
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.

65
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:37,860
- I don't mean this future. - What is this - multiple choice?

66
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:43,490
Some people are afraid¡­ of what might happen.

67
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:49,840
- I was terrified. - What terrified you,specifically?

68
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,480
No more Neutral Zone.

69
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,190
I was used to hating Klingons.

70
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:10,260
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.

71
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,940
- Spock was right. - We all felt exactly the same.

72
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:23,200
No. Somebody felt a lot worse.

73
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,940
I'm beginning to understand why.

74
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,520
If you've got any bright ideas,now is the time.

75
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,250
Time is the problem. You and I are nothing.

76
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,860
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.

77
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:43,220
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.

78
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,960
Unless we can get out of here.

79
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:04,950
It's me - Martia. Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.

80
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,520
- Except us. - It is possible.

81
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:10,880
I know how to get outside the shield.

82
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,890
- How do we fit in? - Getting outside the shield is easy.

83
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,470
After that,you have to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?

84
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,430
- It's possible. - I can't make it alone.

85
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:29,340
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.

86
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,140
Candidate for what?

87
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:51,060
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty. I'll see you there.

88
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,930
Don't disappoint me.

89
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,500
- What is it with you,anyway? - Still think we're finished?

90
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:01,730
More than ever.

91
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,380
Sorry to wake you,sir.

92
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:14,350
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.

93
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,720
What?

94
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:22,300
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock,sir.

95
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:31,300
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.

96
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,910
- Sir? - You have hearing problems?

97
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,310
No,sir.

98
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,720
Klingon blood.

99
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:28,890
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.

100
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,230
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.

101
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,560
Now we go to Starfleet?

102
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,260
We expand our search to include uniforms.

103
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,910
All uniforms?

104
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:02,590
Clear,sir. Make a hole.

105
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,460
Coming through. Coming through.

106
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,010
Sir! Sir!

107
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,680
- I think we've been had. - No,you weren't,Doctor.

108
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,790
Get off at the first level. Follow the gang into the mine.

109
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,510
They don't take girls.

110
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:17,430
- You are crewman Dax? - Yes. What is the problem?

111
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:23,130
Perhaps you know the Russian epic of Cinderella?

112
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,480
If shoe fits - wear it.

113
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,150
Mr Chekov¡­

114
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,970
Watch me.

115
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:55,670
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were¡­

116
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,100
Get in.

117
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,350
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.

118
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:32,900
Hurry!

119
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,600
Up there.

120
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,220
Come on - climb!

121
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,850
Here,you'll need these. Quickly!

122
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,410
Stay close.

123
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,660
- There they are. - They emerge from the beaming shield.

124
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:44,460
Mr Scott,start your engines. Mr Chekov,set course for Rura Penthe.

125
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,670
Mr Spock,Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.

126
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,310
- If we're discovered¡­ - Correct.

127
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,940
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity -

128
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,810
- before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.

129
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,890
- Leave me,I'm finished. - No!

130
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:14,190
Bones,I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.

131
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,460
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.

132
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,270
That cunning little Vulcan.

133
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,610
Come on! We're in the clear.

134
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:30,280
Now that we're outside the shield,they can locate us two sectors away.

135
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:32,510
If they're even looking for us.

136
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:24,160
We must respond. A universal translator would be recognised.

137
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:00,140
¡°What is your destination,over?¡±

138
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,790
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?

139
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,830
- I'm a Chameloid. - I've heard about you.

140
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,370
Shape-shifters. I thought you were mythical.

141
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,200
Give a girl a chance,Captain.

142
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:12,440
It takes a lot of effort.

143
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:15,040
I don't doubt it.

144
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,810
Stop me if I'm wrong,-

145
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,610
- but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?

146
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:25,850
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.

147
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:36,360
We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn,Captain.

148
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,330
If you say so.

149
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,500
Are you crazy?!

150
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,910
She didn't need our help. Where did you get these convenient clothes?

151
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:48,280
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.

152
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:52,150
It's to let them know where we are. Ask her what she's getting in return.

153
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,920
A full pardon¡­ which doesn't cover this.

154
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:00,180
An accident wasn't good enough. Come on,Spock.

155
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:05,160
Good enough for one. Two would have looked suspicious.

156
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:10,770
Killed while attempting escape. That's convincing for both.

157
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,340
Surprise!

158
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,350
- Your friends are late. - They'll be along.

159
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:37,890
- I can't believe I kissed you. - Must have been your lifelong ambition.

160
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,510
Isn't it time you became something else?

161
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,410
I like it here.

162
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:10,920
Well,well,well¡­

163
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:21,170
What took you so long?

164
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,830
Kill him,he's the one.

165
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,910
Not me,you idiot - him!

166
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,840
- No witnesses. - Killed while trying to escape.

167
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,610
- Damned clever,if you ask me. - It's a classic.

168
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,750
- That's what he wanted. - Who? Who wanted us killed?

169
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:44,120
Since you're all going to die anyway,why not tell you?

170
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,320
His name is¡­

171
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:58,840
Damn it! What the hell! Son of a¡­! Couldn't you have waited two seconds?

172
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,980
He was about to explain the whole thing.

173
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,880
- You want to go back? - Absolutely not!

174
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,210
This is the bridge. We're still in Klingon space.

175
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:15,990
Deck 9,remain at battle stations. Deck 9,remain at battle stations.

176
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,820
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.

177
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,230
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship. - So that's it.

178
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:36,770
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.

179
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,170
- Has the peace conference begun? - Who knows? The location is secret.

180
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,370
- There's always something. - Captain! Mr Spock!

181
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:46,920
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.

182
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:08,010
But the uniforms belong to these two men. Burke and Samno.

183
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:12,270
Not anymore. Phaser on ¡°stun¡± at close range.

184
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:16,110
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.

185
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,240
- Now we're back to square one. - Can I talk to you?

186
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,790
- Why weren't they vaporized? - It would set off the alarm.

187
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,160
It's possible.

188
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:41,210
Now hear this. Now hear this.

189
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:45,540
Court reporter to sick bay. Code blue - urgent.

190
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:49,550
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.

191
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:54,120
Repeat,court reporter to sick bay. Code blue - urgent.

192
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,520
Statements to be taken.

193
01:21:56,690 --> 01:22:01,820
Repeat,statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.

194
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,490
You have to shoot.

195
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,810
If you are logical,you have to shoot.

196
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:56,950
- I do not want to. - What you want is irrelevant.

197
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,280
What you've chosen is at hand.

198
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,250
I'd just as soon you didn't.

199
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,520
The operation is over.

200
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:21,570
I did not fire. You cannot prove anything.

201
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:26,870
Yes,I can. At my trial my personal log was used against me.

202
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:31,110
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?

203
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,450
You knew?

204
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:39,050
I tried to tell you,but you would not listen.

205
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:43,290
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.

206
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,990
There were things I tried to tell you,about having faith.

207
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:52,070
You have betrayed the Federation. All of you.

208
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,570
- And what have you've been doing? - Saving Starfleet.

209
01:23:55,740 --> 01:24:02,580
Klingons cannot be trusted. Sir¡­ You said so yourself.

210
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:06,780
They killed your son. Did you not wish Gorkon dead?

211
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:11,580
¡°Let them die¡±,you said. Did I misinterpret you?

212
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,420
And you were right.

213
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,620
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.

214
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,170
How trustworthy can they be?

215
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:26,170
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.

216
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,670
- Who is ¡°us¡±? - All who stands to lose from peace.

217
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,440
Names,Lieutenant.

218
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:38,070
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.

219
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:43,660
- Names,Lieutenant! - I do not remember.

220
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,760
A lie?

221
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:51,090
A choice.

222
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,440
Spock.

223
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:44,510
Admiral Cartwright.

224
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,210
From Starfleet?

225
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:56,820
Who else?

226
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:04,470
General¡­ Chang.

227
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:18,180
- Who else? - Romulan Ambassador and others.

228
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,550
Where is the peace conference?

229
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,890
Where is the peace conference?

230
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,130
She does not know.

231
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:08,130
Then we're dead.

232
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:23,910
I have been dead before. Contact Excelsior.

233
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:28,180
- She'll have the co-ordinates. - I've already got it,sir.

234
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:31,290
- Standing by,Captain Kirk. - Sulu.

235
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:36,050
You realize that by even talking to us,you're violating regulations.

236
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:38,960
I'm sorry,Captain. Your message is breaking up.

237
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:42,900
Bless you,Sulu. Where is the peace conference?

238
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,700
They'll attempt another assassination.

239
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:49,900
It's at Camp Khitomer,near the Romulan border.

240
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,810
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.

241
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,280
We'll need more than that.

242
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:59,350
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire while cloaked.

243
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,890
Surely not.

244
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:06,820
How many of those things are there? Come on,Lieutenant.

245
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,960
- Just the prototype. - Do you hear that?

246
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:13,690
I'm getting under way now. We're in Alpha Quadrant.

247
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,860
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.

248
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:22,060
- When does this conference start? - According to my information - today.

249
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:27,040
- Thank you,Captain Sulu. - Don't mention it,Captain Kirk.

250
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:36,020
Spock?

251
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,420
I prefer it dark.

252
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:49,690
- Dining on ashes? - You were right.

253
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:56,930
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.

254
01:28:57,110 --> 01:29:00,550
You and the Doctor might have been killed.

255
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:03,240
The night is young.

256
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,150
You said it yourself,it was logical. Peace is worth a few personal risks.

257
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,950
You're a great one for logic.

258
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:19,160
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.

259
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:26,000
We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between.

260
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:32,570
I couldn't get past the death of my son.

261
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:37,480
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.

262
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:41,420
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.

263
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:51,530
Is it possible¡­

264
01:29:52,270 --> 01:30:00,100
¡­that we two,you and I,have grown so old and inflexible -

265
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:04,800
- that we have outlived our usefulness?

266
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,970
Would that constitute a joke?

267
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:13,650
- It wasn't your fault. - I was responsible.

268
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,820
- For no actions but your own. - That's not what you said at your trial.

269
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:22,290
That was as captain of the ship. Human beings¡­

270
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,860
We both know that I am not human.

271
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:29,700
Do you want to know something? Everybody's human.

272
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,460
I find that remark¡­ insulting.

273
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,340
Come,I need you.

274
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,540
Madam Chancellor,members of the diplomatic corps¡­

275
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:49,540
¡­honoured guests.

276
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,090
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.

277
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:12,740
She's out here somewhere.

278
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:17,820
- But if she's cloaked¡­ - Then all we have is a radiation surge.

279
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:22,510
By the time we're close enough to record it,we're ashes.

280
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:27,790
2.06¡­

281
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:33,130
2.03¡­

282
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:38,790
- Close enough to beam down? - Not yet. In two minutes. 1.58.

283
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:43,300
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.

284
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:57,220
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing -

285
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:02,290
- it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.

286
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,290
- Uhura? - Nothing,Captain.

287
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:11,630
If she's here,she's rigged for silent running.

288
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:22,310
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.

289
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,010
Transporter room. Stand by to beam down.

290
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:30,480
53¡­

291
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,690
48 seconds.

292
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:43,430
44¡­

293
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:48,830
I can see you,Kirk.

294
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:51,030
Chang.

295
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:53,700
Can you see me?

296
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:58,650
Now be honest,Captain. Warrior to warrior.

297
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:02,780
You do prefer it this way,don't you? As it was meant to be.

298
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,290
No peace in our time.

299
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:11,730
¡°Once more unto the breach,dear friends.¡±

300
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:30,410
- This is fun. - Reverse engines. All astern.

301
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,810
One and a half impulse power. Back off!

302
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,190
What's she waiting for?

303
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,160
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.

304
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,600
Wondering whether we detect her.

305
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:56,570
Incoming!

306
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,080
- In range? - Not yet,sir.

307
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,770
Come on!

308
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:06,850
- She'll fly apart. - Fly her apart,then!

309
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:12,690
Many speculated about my father's motives.

310
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:18,060
Some said he was an idealist. Others said he had no choice.

311
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:23,860
If Praxis had not exploded,his idealism wouldn't have found expression.

312
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,470
We are a proud race.

313
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:32,370
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.

314
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:46,980
- Go to auxiliary power! - Auxiliary circuits destroyed.

315
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:56,430
¡°Tickle us,do we not laugh? Prick us,do we not bleed?¡±

316
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,670
¡°Wrong us,shall we not revenge?¡±

317
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,330
Gas.

318
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:09,880
Gas,Captain. Under impulse power she expands fuel,like all vessels.

319
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:15,580
We call it ¡°plasma¡±,but it is merely ionised gas.

320
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,660
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

321
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:24,960
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.

322
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:29,500
Doctor,would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?

323
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:30,970
Fascinating.

324
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,630
Hard to starboard.

325
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:41,070
The proposed agenda is as follows: The evacuation of Kronos -

326
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,710
- has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.

327
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,510
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation¡­

328
01:35:57,630 --> 01:36:03,000
Captain,she's packing quite a wallop. Shields weakening.

329
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:14,640
Shields up! Alright,now we're giving them something else to shoot at.

330
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:24,120
The game's afoot.

331
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,270
- Excelsior's been hit! - ¡°Our revels now are ended¡±,Kirk.

332
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:50,240
¡°Cry havoc,and let slip the dogs of war.¡±

333
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:54,350
- Bones,where's my torpedo? - Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.

334
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,590
Shields collapsing!

335
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:02,890
The key,please. Time is short.

336
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,100
- The hull has been compromised. - I wonder how bad.

337
01:37:14,270 --> 01:37:15,870
Connect echo-bars.

338
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,440
¡­discuss the report on phase 2.

339
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:22,100
- Alter circuit A. - Sensor.

340
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,910
¡­we commence within minutes of the preparation.

341
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:29,820
- ¡°I am constant as the Northern star.¡± - I'd give real money,if he'd shut up.

342
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:31,820
Plate,please.

343
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:33,650
¡­and assimilation will consume¡­

344
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:35,890
We've got a heart beat.

345
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,960
¡­with the Klingon Empire¡­

346
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:40,890
Key,please.

347
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:43,430
- Where's that torpedo? - She's ready.

348
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,830
Lock and load!

349
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:49,070
Fire!

350
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:03,760
¡°To be¡­ or not¡±¡­

351
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,990
¡­¡°to be.¡±

352
01:38:08,290 --> 01:38:10,350
Target that explosion and fire.

353
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:14,790
Fire!

354
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:28,210
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.

355
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,010
I hope that the delegation -

356
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:37,280
- can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.

357
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:41,320
As you know,time is of the essence.

358
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:43,120
Out of the way!

359
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:50,120
Mr President!

360
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,170
Mr President!

361
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:56,870
Kirk,Enterprise.

362
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:10,980
- Arrest those men! - Arrest yourself!

363
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:17,390
We've got a full confession.

364
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:36,380
- This is not Klingon blood. - Cartwright. Just a minute.

365
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,790
What's happened? What's the mean of all of this?

366
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:42,990
It's about the future,Madam Chancellor.

367
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:49,500
Some people think the future means the end of history.

368
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:52,300
We haven't run out of history quite yet.

369
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:57,010
Your father called the future¡­

370
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:00,980
¡­¡°the undiscovered country¡±.

371
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:06,080
People can be very frightened of change.

372
01:40:11,260 --> 01:40:13,530
You've restored my father's faith.

373
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:17,830
And you've restored my son's.

374
01:41:05,690 --> 01:41:08,480
Once again,we've saved civilization as we know it.

375
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:11,320
And they're not going to prosecute.

376
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:14,950
They could have prosecuted me. I felt like Val'eris.

377
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:18,000
They don't arrest people for having feelings.

378
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:24,570
And it's a good thing,too. If they did,we'd all have to turn ourselves in.

379
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:28,900
- Captain Kirk. - Captain Sulu.

380
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:32,940
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,I owe you my thanks.

381
01:41:33,110 --> 01:41:39,420
Nice to see you in action one more time,Captain Kirk. Take care.

382
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:56,030
- My God,that's a big ship. - Not so big as her captain.

383
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,970
So¡­ This is goodbye?

384
01:42:01,110 --> 01:42:04,080
It's about time we got underway ourselves.

385
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,370
Captain,I have orders from Starfleet Command.

386
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:13,080
We're to put back to space dock immediately¡­ to be decommissioned.

387
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:33,000
If I were human,I believe my response would be:

388
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,160
¡°Go to hell.¡±

389
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,340
If I were human.

390
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,110
Course heading,Captain?

391
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:55,390
Second star to the right.

392
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,660
And straight on 'til morning.

393
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:20,070
Captain's log,stardate 9529.1.

394
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:24,450
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.

395
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,650
This ship,and her history -

396
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:29,760
- will shortly become the care of another crew.

397
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:33,830
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.

398
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,430
They'll continue the voyages we have begun -

399
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,000
- and journey to all the undiscovered countries -

400
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:44,200
- boldly going where no man,where no one¡­

401
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:46,900
¡­has gone before.
