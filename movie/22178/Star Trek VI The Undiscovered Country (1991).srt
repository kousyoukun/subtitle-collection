00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,489
According to this, we've completed
our survey of the entire sector.

10
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:18,087
I have an energy wave
at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.

11
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,339
Visual.

12
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,801
My God.

13
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:29,023
Shields. Shields!

14
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:41,361
She's not answering her helm.

15
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,613
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.

16
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:44,739
Aye.

17
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:50,119
Quarter impulse power.

18
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,129
Damage report.

19
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:01,422
Checking all systems, Captain.

20
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:09,806
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.

21
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,099
Negative, sir.

22
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:15,937
The subspace shockwave
originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.

23
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,297
Location...

24
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,400
It's Praxis, sir. It's a Klingon moon.

25
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:23,736
Praxis is their key
energy production facility.

26
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,366
Send to Klingon High Command.

27
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,285
This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.

28
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:34,998
We have monitored
a large explosion in your sector.

29
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,250
Do you require assistance?

30
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:40,169
Aye, sir.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?

31
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:42,964
Yes, sir. I've confirmed
the location of Praxis, but...

32
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,257
What is it?

33
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,343
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

34
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:48,720
Onscreen.

35
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Magnify.

36
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,807
Computer enhancement.

37
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,354
Praxis?
What's left of it, sir.

38
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,857
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.

39
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:02,442
Let's have it.

40
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:19,292
This is Brigadier Kerla
speaking for the High Command.

41
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:22,920
There has been an incident on Praxis.

42
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:28,468
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.

43
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:34,557
Obey treaty stipulations
and remain outside the neutral zone.

44
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,852
This transmission ends now.

45
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:41,731
An incident?

46
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,369
Do we report this, sir?

47
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:45,166
Are you kidding?

48
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:53,802
What are we doing here?

49
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,245
Maybe they're throwing us
a retirement party.

50
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,415
That suits me. I just bought a boat.
This had better be good.

51
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,376
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar
at the Academy.

52
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,921
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?

53
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,589
If we're all here, where's Sulu?

54
00:07:06,673 --> 00:07:10,134
Captain Sulu. On assignment.
Where's Spock?

55
00:07:18,894 --> 00:07:23,481
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.

56
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,097
As you were.

57
00:07:34,827 --> 00:07:37,578
To break this information down
succinctly,

58
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:41,374
the Klingon Empire
has roughly 50 years of life left to it.

59
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,294
For full details,
I'm turning this briefing over

60
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,555
to the Federation's special envoy.

61
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:01,411
Good morning.

62
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,648
Two months ago, a Federation starship
monitored an explosion

63
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,817
on the Klingon moon Praxis.

64
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:10,611
We believe it was caused by over-mining

65
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:13,489
and insufficient safety precautions.

66
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:17,577
The moon's decimation means
the deadly pollution of their ozone.

67
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:19,787
They will have depleted
their supply of oxygen

68
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,456
in approximately 50 Earth years.

69
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,668
Due to their enormous military budget,

70
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,670
the Klingon economy does not have
the resources

71
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,423
with which to combat this catastrophe.

72
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,344
Last month, at the behest
of the Vulcan ambassador,

73
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,511
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,

74
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,932
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.

75
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:44,979
He proposes to commence negotiations
at once.

76
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,356
Negotiations for what?

77
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:52,361
The dismantling of our space stations
and starbases along the neutral zone,

78
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:55,881
an end to almost 70 years
of unremitting hostility,

79
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,926
which the Klingons can no longer afford.

80
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:02,997
Bill, are we talking
about mothballing the Starfleet?

81
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:06,459
Well, I'm sure that our exploration
and scientific programs

82
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:09,295
would be unaffected, Captain, but...
I must protest.

83
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,217
To offer Klingons safe haven
within Federation space is suicide.

84
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:17,553
Klingons would become
the alien trash of the galaxy,

85
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:19,263
and if we dismantle the fleet,

86
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:21,974
we'd be defenseless
before an aggressive species

87
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:24,060
with a foothold on our territory.

88
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:27,363
The opportunity here
is to bring them to their knees.

89
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:32,485
Then we'll be in a far better position
to dictate terms.

90
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,278
Sir?

91
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,697
Captain Kirk.

92
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:39,533
The Klingons
have never been trustworthy.

93
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,912
I'm forced to agree
with Admiral Cartwright.

94
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,997
This is a terrifying idea.

95
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,335
It is imperative that we act now
to support the Gorkon initiative

96
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,463
lest more conservative elements
persuade his empire

97
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:56,634
that it is better to attempt
a military solution and die fighting.

98
00:09:56,802 --> 00:10:00,137
You, Captain Kirk,
are to be our first olive branch.

99
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,508
We have volunteered to rendezvous
with the Klingon vessel

100
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,502
which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon
to Earth

101
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:09,864
and to escort him safely
through Federation space.

102
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,148
Me?

103
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:14,485
Well, there are Klingons who feel
the same way about the peace treaty

104
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:17,071
as yourself and Admiral Cartwright,

105
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,742
but they'll think twice about attacking
the Enterprise under your command.

106
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:25,496
I have personally vouched for you
in this matter, Captain.

107
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:29,041
You have personally vouched?

108
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:34,755
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon
full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.

109
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,716
But a full ambassador
would be better equipped...

110
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:39,051
If there's no further business,

111
00:10:39,636 --> 00:10:43,597
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

112
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:45,992
I remind you, this meeting is classified.

113
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:55,835
I don't know whether
to congratulate you or not, Jim.

114
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,904
I wouldn't.

115
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,493
We volunteered?

116
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,794
There is an old Vulcan proverb.

117
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,383
Only Nixon could go to China.

118
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,377
How could you vouch for me?

119
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:16,922
That's arrogant presumption.

120
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,175
My father requested
that I open negotiations...

121
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,136
I know your father's the Vulcan
ambassador, for heaven's sake,

122
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,880
but you know how I feel about this.

123
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,391
They're animals.

124
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:31,771
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.

125
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:34,523
Don't believe them. Don't trust them.

126
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:37,610
They are dying.
Let them die.

127
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:42,400
Has it occurred to you,

128
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:45,926
that this crew is due to
stand down in three months?

129
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,505
We've done our bit for king and country.

130
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:51,816
You should have trusted me.

131
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,884
<i>Control, this is SD-103,
approach to spacedock. Over.</i>

132
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:05,554
<i>SD-103, you are clear
to deliver Captain Kirk and party</i>

133
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,308
<i>to NCC-1701 Alpha. Over.</i>

134
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:16,023
Captain on the Bridge.

135
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:19,193
As you were, Lieutenant...
Valeris, sir.

136
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:22,405
We were told that you needed
a helmsman, so I volunteered.

137
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,658
Lieutenant, it is agreeable
to see you again.

138
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,744
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan
to be graduated

139
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,365
at the top of her class at the academy.
You must be very proud.

140
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,250
I don't believe so, sir.

141
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,277
She's a Vulcan, all right.

142
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:38,738
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.

143
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:41,590
Scotty.
<i>Aye, sir?</i>

144
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:42,925
Did you find the engine room?

145
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,427
<i>Right where I left it, sir.</i>

146
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:47,471
Standby. Uhura, get me the dockmaster.

147
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:49,365
Control tower reading, sir.

148
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,827
Control, this is Enterprise,

149
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:54,252
requesting permission to depart.

150
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:57,857
<i>This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.</i>

151
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,525
<i>Thirty seconds for port gates.</i>

152
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,235
Clear all moorings.

153
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,863
Awaiting port gates from this mark.

154
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,364
<i>All moorings clear.</i>

155
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:07,116
Aft thrusters.

156
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,210
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.

157
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:13,956
Captain, may I remind you
that regulations specify thrusters

158
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,041
only while in spacedock?

159
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,572
Jim?

160
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:25,952
You heard the order, Lieutenant.

161
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:28,521
Aye, sir.

162
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,508
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.

163
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,145
I've never trusted Klingons,

164
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,953
and I never will.

165
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:17,295
I could never forgive them
for the death of my boy.

166
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,983
It seems to me our mission
to escort the Chancellor

167
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:26,612
of the Klingon High Council
to a peace summit

168
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:29,448
is problematic at best.

169
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:36,004
Spock says this could be
an historic occasion,

170
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,431
and I'd like to believe him,

171
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:42,127
but how on earth can history
get past people like me?

172
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:45,990
Sorry.

173
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,384
You could have knocked.

174
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:50,423
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.

175
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:52,453
I thought that you would like to know.

176
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:53,581
Right.

177
00:14:58,144 --> 00:14:59,976
Permission to speak freely, sir.

178
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,213
It is an honor to serve with you.

179
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,990
You piloted well
out of spacedock, Lieutenant.

180
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:14,285
I've always wanted to try that, sir.

181
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,672
You've done well, Valeris.

182
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:30,593
As your sponsor at the academy,

183
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:33,470
I have followed your career
with satisfaction,

184
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:37,850
and as a Vulcan,
you've exceeded my expectations.

185
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:42,354
I do not understand this representation.

186
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:46,300
It is a depiction
from ancient Earth mythology,

187
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,320
the expulsion from Paradise.

188
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:51,989
Why keep it in your quarters?

189
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,951
It is a reminder to me
that all things end.

190
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:04,001
It is of endings that I wish to speak.

191
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:09,840
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.

192
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,010
Do you not recognize

193
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,390
that a turning point has been reached
in the affairs of the Federation?

194
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:24,063
History is replete
with turning points, Lieutenant.

195
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,732
You must have faith.
Faith?

196
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:30,569
That the universe
will unfold as it should.

197
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:33,722
But is that logical? Surely we must...

198
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:35,598
Logic, logic and logic.

199
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:41,680
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris,

200
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:43,574
not the end.

201
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:50,214
This will be my final voyage on board
this vessel as a member of her crew.

202
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,844
Nature abhors a vacuum.

203
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,682
I intend you to replace me.

204
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,943
I could only succeed you, sir.

205
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,034
<i>Now hear this. All officers to the Bridge.</i>

206
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,370
<i>Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.</i>

207
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,330
<i>All officers to the Bridge.</i>

208
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,449
Captain on the Bridge.

209
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:58,257
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?

210
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,119
Never been this close.

211
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:07,633
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting
our signal.

212
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:19,845
Uhura, hailing frequencies.
Aye, sir.

213
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,765
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.

214
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,601
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.

215
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,853
Channel is open, Captain.

216
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:30,564
This is the Starship Enterprise,

217
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,025
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

218
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:35,861
This is Kronos One.

219
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,031
I am Chancellor Gorkon.

220
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,954
Chancellor, we've been ordered
to escort you

221
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,124
through Federation space
to your meeting on Earth.

222
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:50,918
Thank you, Captain.

223
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:54,296
Would you and your party
care to dine this evening

224
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,632
aboard the Enterprise with my officers,

225
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,718
as guests of the United
Federation of Planets?

226
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:03,722
We would be delighted to accept
your gracious invitation.

227
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:10,313
We'll make arrangements to have you
beamed aboard at 1930 hours.

228
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,106
I shall look forward to that.

229
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:21,813
Well, I hope you're happy.

230
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:23,032
Captain,

231
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:26,311
there is a supply
of Romulan ale aboard.

232
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,540
It might make the evening
pass more smoothly.

233
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,959
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.

234
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,214
Guess who's coming to dinner.

235
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:50,102
Energize.

236
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:26,638
Chancellor Gorkon.
Captain Kirk.

237
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,892
May I present Captain Spock,
whom I believe you know.

238
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:32,477
Captain, face to face at last.

239
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,148
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.

240
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:40,319
Gentlemen,

241
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:43,739
this is my daughter Azetbur,

242
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:50,495
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla,

243
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:56,309
and this is General Chang,
my chief of staff.

244
00:20:57,045 --> 00:21:00,047
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.

245
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:03,508
I'm not sure how to take that.

246
00:21:04,052 --> 00:21:06,970
Sincere admiration, Kirk.

247
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:10,057
From one warrior to another.

248
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,143
Right.

249
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,983
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.

250
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:40,545
They all look alike.
What about that smell?

251
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,007
You know only top-of-the-line models
can even talk...

252
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:50,639
You men have work?

253
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:51,924
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:53,892
Then snap to it.

255
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,767
I offer a toast.

256
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:38,770
The undiscover'd country,

257
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,650
the future.

258
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:45,694
The undiscover'd country.
The undiscover'd country.

259
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,238
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.

260
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:49,990
You've not experienced Shakespeare

261
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:52,701
until you have read him
in the original Klingon.

262
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,340
Captain Kirk,
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.

263
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,843
One of the advantages
of being 1,000 light-years

264
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,645
from Federation Headquarters.

265
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:16,475
To you, Chancellor Gorkon,
one of the architects of our future.

266
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:18,351
Chancellor.
Chancellor.

267
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:24,232
Perhaps we are looking
at something of that future here.

268
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:28,737
Tell me, Captain Kirk,

269
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:33,625
would you be willing to give up Starfleet?

270
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:42,584
I believe the Captain feels
that Starfleet's mission

271
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,878
has always been one of peace.

272
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,966
Far be it for me
to dispute my first officer,

273
00:23:50,051 --> 00:23:51,718
but Starfleet has always been at the fore...

274
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:53,970
Captain, there's no need to mince words.

275
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:57,140
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.

276
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,104
General, are you fond of

277
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,356
Shakespeare?

278
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:07,568
We do believe all planets have a

279
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:10,445
sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.

280
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,333
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.

281
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,327
Human rights.

282
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,205
Why, the very name is racist.

283
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:25,377
The Federation is no more
than a Homo Sapiens Only club.

284
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:28,380
Present company excepted, of course.

285
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:29,893
In any case,

286
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:31,882
we know where this is leading.

287
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:35,470
The annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.

288
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:36,847
No?
No.

289
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,683
To be, or not to be.

290
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:43,728
That is the question which preoccupies
our people, Captain Kirk.

291
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:47,315
We need breathing room.
Earth, Hitler, 1938.

292
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,902
I beg your pardon?

293
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:56,083
Well...

294
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:02,080
I see we have a long way to go.

295
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,250
We must do this again sometime.

296
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,257
You don't trust me, do you?

297
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:14,860
I don't blame you.

298
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:19,681
If there is to be a brave new world,

299
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:23,768
our generation is going
to have the hardest time living in it.

300
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:29,816
Captain Spock.

301
00:25:30,318 --> 00:25:31,493
Chancellor.

302
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,738
Madam.
Captain.

303
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:37,115
Well, most kind.

304
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,829
Parting is such sweet sorrow, Captain.

305
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:47,876
Have we not
heard the chimes at midnight?

306
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:13,360
Thank God.

307
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:17,113
Did you see the way they ate?

308
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,075
Terrible table manners.

309
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:22,577
I doubt that our own behavior

310
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:25,345
will distinguish us in
the annals of diplomacy.

311
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:26,957
I'm going to sleep this off.

312
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,760
Please let me know if there's some
other way we can screw up tonight.

313
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:32,879
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.

314
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:52,107
The Enterprise hosted
Chancellor Gorkon and company

315
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,025
to dinner last night.

316
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:57,300
Our manners weren't exactly,

317
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:58,887
Emily Post.

318
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:01,116
Note to the galley,

319
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,869
Romulan ale no longer to be served
at diplomatic functions.

320
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,734
<i>Captain Kirk, will you please
join me on the Bridge?</i>

321
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:13,169
<i>Captain Kirk?</i>

322
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:21,353
Captain.
What is it?

323
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:23,388
I find this curious.

324
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:24,639
Spock, I'm really tired.

325
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:28,184
We are reading an enormous amount
of neutron radiation.

326
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:30,770
Where?

327
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:34,065
Strangely enough,
it appears to be emanating from us.

328
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,592
The Enterprise?

329
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,448
Valeris, do you know anything
about a radiation surge?

330
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:42,949
Sir?

331
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:44,200
Chekov?

332
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,911
Only the size of my head.

333
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,797
I know what you mean.

334
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:07,766
What's happened?
We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.

335
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,851
Torpedo Room, please confirm.

336
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,311
Have we fired?

337
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:12,604
0-6...

338
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:14,539
Uhura, monitor.
Aye, sir.

339
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:16,299
Direct hit.

340
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,902
Confirmed, sir.

341
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:32,040
We've lost gravity!

342
00:28:46,555 --> 00:28:48,264
We are betrayed!

343
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:51,368
<i>This is the Bridge. Do you read?
Do you read?</i>

344
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:53,895
Torpedo bay,
did we fire those torpedoes?

345
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:56,356
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory,

346
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,066
we're still fully loaded.

347
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,421
Find Chang.

348
00:29:26,387 --> 00:29:29,264
Unable to confirm or deny
firing of two photon torpedoes.

349
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:31,141
Hailing frequencies.
Aye, sir.

350
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:36,771
<i>Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read? Over.</i>

351
00:29:37,773 --> 00:29:39,691
Repeat. Kronos One...

352
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:44,881
It's very hard to make out, Captain.

353
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:48,426
There's been some weapons firing
and a lot of shouting.

354
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:49,844
She is still listing.

355
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,980
She's spinning out of control.

356
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,203
Restoring auxiliary gravity.

357
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:29,217
<i>Have you not a shred
of decency in you, Kirk?</i>

358
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:34,180
<i>We come in peace,
and you blatantly defile that peace.</i>

359
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:38,476
<i>For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.</i>

360
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:43,515
We haven't fired.
Captain.

361
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:48,295
According to our databanks,
we have, twice.

362
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:51,322
Captain, they're coming about.

363
00:31:57,997 --> 00:32:01,082
They're preparing to fire.
Shields up, Captain?

364
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:04,460
Captain, our shields.
Shields up, Captain?

365
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:09,173
Signal our surrender.
Captain?

366
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:10,717
We surrender!

367
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:14,304
This is Enterprise. We surrender.
If they fire at us

368
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:15,847
with our shields down...
I repeat.

369
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:18,099
We surrender.
we will not be able to respond.

370
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:20,393
Repeat. Enterprise surrenders.

371
00:32:24,523 --> 00:32:26,899
Are we firing torpedoes?
I wish I knew.

372
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:28,860
Well, it sure looks like it.

373
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:30,612
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.

374
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:33,114
I am responsible
for involving you in this. I will go.

375
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:35,617
No, I'll go. You'll be responsible
for getting me out of this.

376
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:37,785
We'll not be the instigators
of full-scale war

377
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,579
on the eve of universal peace.

378
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:41,697
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.

379
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:42,674
Perhaps you're right.

380
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:44,057
Uhura, tell them we're coming,

381
00:32:44,217 --> 00:32:45,827
and tell them we're unarmed.

382
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:46,681
Aye, sir.

383
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,093
Have you lost your mind?

384
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:55,928
I give you my word,
I don't understand what has happened.

385
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,680
We're here to help.

386
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:00,733
Follow me.

387
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:29,420
Chancellor Gorkon.
My God.

388
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:31,574
What has happened here?

389
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,699
You dare to feign ignorance?

390
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,787
What happened?

391
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,868
With a direct torpedo hit,

392
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:39,639
you crippled our entire gravitational field,

393
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:43,710
and two of your Starfleet crew
beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots

394
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:44,894
and did this.

395
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:46,562
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?

396
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:48,356
We were until this disgrace.

397
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,775
Well, then for God sakes, man,
let me help.

398
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,130
I've got a pulse. We can move him.

399
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:07,234
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?

400
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,345
Hold him. Hold him while I stabilize him.

401
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:27,812
I said hold him.

402
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:33,609
Sweet Jesus.

403
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:37,121
Can you...
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.

404
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:44,829
His wounds are not closing.
He's killing him!

405
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,920
He's gone into
some kind of damned arrest.

406
00:34:57,176 --> 00:35:00,303
Come on, damn it! Come on!

407
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,350
He's not responding.

408
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:29,123
Don't let it end this way, Captain.

409
00:36:05,452 --> 00:36:10,422
Under article number 184
of your interstellar law,

410
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:14,126
I'm placing you under arrest.

411
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:16,626
You are charged with assassinating,

412
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:19,865
our Chancellor of the High Council.

413
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:21,317
He tried to save him.

414
00:36:28,642 --> 00:36:29,960
They've been arrested.

415
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:34,605
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.

416
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:39,443
I assume command of this ship
as of 0230 hours.

417
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:42,530
Commander Uhura,
please notify Starfleet Headquarters.

418
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,031
Tell them precisely what has taken place

419
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:45,825
and request instructions.
Aye, sir.

420
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:48,594
We cannot allow them to be taken back
to Kronos as prisoners.

421
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,238
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?

422
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:52,208
Opening fire will not retrieve them,

423
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:55,234
and an armed conflict is precisely
what the Captain wished to avoid.

424
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,587
We will be able to follow
the Captain's movements.

425
00:36:57,671 --> 00:37:01,132
How did you achieve this, sir?
Time is precious, Lieutenant.

426
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:04,719
We must endeavor to piece together
what happened here tonight.

427
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:08,431
According to our databank,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

428
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:09,724
No way.

429
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:11,618
I sympathize Mr. Scott,

430
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,276
but we need evidence.

431
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:14,887
Please accompany me.

432
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:19,450
And if we cannot
piece together what happened?

433
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,862
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr. Chekov,

434
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:25,957
it resides in the purview of the diplomats.

435
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,828
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!

436
00:37:31,788 --> 00:37:36,500
The result of an unprovoked attack
while he travelled to see you

437
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:39,554
under a flag of truce,
on a mission of peace.

438
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:43,591
Captain Kirk was legally arrested
for the crime.

439
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:46,594
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy

440
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:49,722
boarded Kronos One of their own free will?

441
00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:52,558
None of these facts are in dispute,
Mr. President.

442
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:55,436
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.

443
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:58,272
In the meantime...
In the meantime,

444
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:02,610
we expect the Federation to abide
by the articles of interstellar law,

445
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,695
which you claim to cherish.

446
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,782
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial

447
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:10,117
for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.

448
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:11,953
Out of the question.

449
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,214
Ambassador Sarek, there must be
some way to extradite these men.

450
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:20,628
Mr. President, I share a measure
of personal responsibility in this matter,

451
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:22,588
but I am obliged to confirm

452
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:25,424
my esteemed colleague's
legal interpretation.

453
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,510
What is the position
of the Romulan government,

454
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,136
Ambassador Nanclus?

455
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:32,765
I must concur with my colleagues.

456
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:36,018
But you can't possibly believe
that James Kirk assassinated

457
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:38,604
the Chancellor of the High Council.

458
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:42,274
Mr. President, I don't know what to believe.

459
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:46,237
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.

460
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:51,617
This president is not above the law.

461
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:55,538
Report back at once. Do you copy?
At once.

462
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:57,999
Enterprise to report back on the double.

463
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,500
Do you read? At once.

464
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,252
We're to report back at once.

465
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:03,754
We cannot abandon
Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.

466
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,339
Of course not.

467
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:07,842
Four hundred years ago
on the planet Earth,

468
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:11,053
workers who felt their livelihood
threatened by automation

469
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:16,517
flung their wooden shoes called sabot
into the machines to stop them.

470
00:39:18,854 --> 00:39:22,189
Hence the word sabotage.

471
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,611
We are experiencing technical malfunction.

472
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:30,072
All backup systems inoperative.

473
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:33,784
Excellent. I mean, too bad.

474
00:39:35,203 --> 00:39:36,704
<i>Mr. President,</i>

475
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:39,040
<i>I've been named Chancellor
by the High Council</i>

476
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:40,916
<i>in my father's place.</i>

477
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,668
Madam Chancellor,

478
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:45,713
you have my sincerest condolences
on your recent loss.

479
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,466
I want to assure you
that this shameful deed will not...

480
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,635
<i>Mr. President, let us come to the point.</i>

481
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:55,514
<i>You want this conference
to go forward, and so did my father.</i>

482
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,185
<i>I will attend in one week on one condition.</i>

483
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:01,562
<i>We will not extradite the prisoners,</i>

484
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:05,900
<i>and you will make no attempt
to rescue them in a military operation.</i>

485
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:09,737
<i>We would consider any such attempt
an act of war.</i>

486
00:40:10,238 --> 00:40:12,073
We hope you'll be our guest
here on Earth.

487
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:17,203
<i>After recent events, you will understand
if I say I prefer a neutral site,</i>

488
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:20,022
<i>and in the interests of security,</i>

489
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:22,790
<i>let us keep the location
secret for now.</i>

490
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:25,669
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.

491
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,758
Attack them now, while we still can!

492
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:34,929
Attack or be slaves in their world.

493
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:42,144
We can take whole by force,
what they propose to divide.

494
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,091
War is obsolete, General,

495
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:52,744
as we are in danger of becoming.

496
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:58,536
Better to die on our feet
than live on our knees.

497
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:00,489
He can't be!

498
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:05,017
Your father was killed
for what he wanted.

499
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,555
The peace process will go forward.

500
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:12,892
Kirk...

501
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:21,058
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

502
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,676
It's a damn show trial.

503
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,429
Kirk! Kirk!
Kirk! Kirk!

504
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:11,025
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One
without provocation.

505
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:13,736
The Chancellor and his advisers...

506
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,739
having been lulled
into a false sense of security

507
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:20,367
by an invitation to a state dinner
aboard Captain Kirk's vessel

508
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:24,455
at precisely 1930 hours
that same evening.

509
00:42:25,123 --> 00:42:27,124
Call your first witness.

510
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:31,045
After the first shot,
we lost our gravitational field.

511
00:42:31,129 --> 00:42:33,797
I found myself weightless
and unable to function.

512
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:36,967
<i>Then two Starfleet crewmen
came walking towards me.</i>

513
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:39,511
<i>But perhaps they merely wore
Starfleet uniforms.</i>

514
00:42:39,596 --> 00:42:42,890
<i>That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.</i>

515
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:47,144
<i>Colonel Worf,
we are interested in facts, not theories.</i>

516
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:51,065
If the gravitational unit was not functioning,

517
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:53,067
how could these men be walking?

518
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:55,486
They appeared to be wearing
magnetic boots.

519
00:42:58,031 --> 00:42:59,531
Gravity boots.

520
00:43:00,992 --> 00:43:02,601
<i>Dr McCoy,</i>

521
00:43:02,726 --> 00:43:06,353
would you be so good as to tell me,

522
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:09,500
what is your current medical status?

523
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:14,421
Aside from a touch of arthritis,
I'd say pretty good.

524
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:24,014
You have a singular wit, Doctor.

525
00:43:24,808 --> 00:43:28,686
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon
aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.

526
00:43:29,145 --> 00:43:31,355
In three months, I stand down.

527
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:38,195
You know, I believe that you consumed

528
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,449
a rather generous amount
of Romulan ale in the officers' mess

529
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:44,243
on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?

530
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:46,453
Objection!
Sustained.

531
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:49,331
We all did. All of us.

532
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:54,295
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive

533
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:56,297
when you first examined him?

534
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:59,133
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.

535
00:43:59,217 --> 00:44:06,056
Have you ever, in your past,
saved patients as barely alive as he?

536
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:09,560
I didn't have the medical knowledge
I needed for Klingon anatomy.

537
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:11,937
I see.
You were there.

538
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:15,441
You say you are due for retirement.

539
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:18,360
May I ask, do your hands shake?

540
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:20,487
Objection!
I was nervous.

541
00:44:22,574 --> 00:44:23,574
No.

542
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:26,410
You were incompetent.

543
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,372
You were incompetent!

544
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:34,752
Whether deliberately or as a result
of age combined with drink,

545
00:44:35,295 --> 00:44:37,076
the court will have to determine.

546
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:38,221
My God, man!

547
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,405
I tried to save him!

548
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:43,010
I tried to save him.

549
00:44:45,263 --> 00:44:47,348
I was desperate to save him.

550
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,770
He was the last best hope
in the universe for peace.

551
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:55,647
The witness is excused.

552
00:44:59,986 --> 00:45:02,112
There we have it, citizens.

553
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:05,699
We have finally established
the particulars of the crime,

554
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:10,454
and now we come to the architect
of this tragic affair,

555
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,959
James Tiberius Kirk.

556
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:21,090
What would your favorite author say, Captain?

557
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,966
Let us sit upon the ground

558
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:25,969
and tell sad stories of the death of kings.

559
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:29,139
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.

560
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:34,103
Tell us that you planned to take revenge
for the death of your son.

561
00:45:35,271 --> 00:45:37,398
That's not true.
Objection!

562
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:40,442
Captain Kirk has not been identified
as the assassin.

563
00:45:40,527 --> 00:45:42,152
Sustained.

564
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:44,446
I offer into the record,

565
00:45:45,156 --> 00:45:48,409
this excerpt
from the Captain's personal log.

566
00:45:49,536 --> 00:45:53,414
<i>I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.</i>

567
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:58,585
<i>I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.</i>

568
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:04,316
Again. Again!

569
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:08,345
<i>I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.</i>

570
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:12,933
<i>I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.</i>

571
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:18,230
Are those your words?

572
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,761
Those words were spoken by me.

573
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:29,283
Objection!

574
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:32,119
My client's political views
are not on trial here.

575
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:35,205
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives

576
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,125
are indeed
at the very heart of the matter.

577
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:41,295
This officer's record
shows him to be an insubordinate,

578
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:44,673
unprincipled,
career-minded opportunist,

579
00:46:44,757 --> 00:46:46,925
with a history of violating
the chain of command

580
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,469
whenever it suited him!

581
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:49,970
Continue.

582
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:52,639
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk

583
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:54,433
once held the rank of Admiral,

584
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:57,853
and that Admiral Kirk was broken
for taking matters into his own hands

585
00:46:57,937 --> 00:46:59,563
in defiance of regulations of the law.

586
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,440
Do you deny being demoted
for these charges?

587
00:47:01,524 --> 00:47:04,443
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!

588
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:05,652
I cannot deny it.

589
00:47:05,737 --> 00:47:07,321
You were demoted?
Yes.

590
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:11,742
For insubordination?
On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.

591
00:47:11,826 --> 00:47:14,870
And were you obeying
or disobeying orders

592
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:18,040
when you arranged the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon?

593
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:20,834
I didn't know about the assassination
until we boarded the ship.

594
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:23,795
You still deny the Enterprise
fired on Kronos One?

595
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,839
Well...
Your Honors, please!

596
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:29,051
And you still deny your men beamed
aboard and shot the Chancellor?

597
00:47:29,135 --> 00:47:30,260
Objection!

598
00:47:30,345 --> 00:47:32,930
I cannot confirm or deny actions
I did not witness.

599
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:34,473
Captain Kirk,

600
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:38,477
are you aware
that as the captain of a starship,

601
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,731
you are required to be responsible
for the actions of your men?

602
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,652
I am.

603
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:49,988
And if it should be proved
that members of your crew

604
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:53,242
did, in fact,
carry out such an assassination...

605
00:47:53,326 --> 00:47:55,494
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...

606
00:47:55,578 --> 00:47:56,578
Do not answer!

607
00:47:56,663 --> 00:47:59,957
Captain Kirk,
you will answer the question.

608
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:09,424
As captain,

609
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:15,097
I am responsible for the conduct
of the crew under my command.

610
00:48:18,768 --> 00:48:20,936
Your Honors, the State rests.

611
00:48:23,481 --> 00:48:25,357
Send to Commander Enterprise.

612
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:30,946
We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior.

613
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:38,203
It is the determination of this court
that the prisoners are guilty as charged.

614
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:51,758
I wish to note for the record

615
00:48:51,843 --> 00:48:55,596
that the evidence against my clients
is entirely circumstantial.

616
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,725
I beg the court to consider this
when pronouncing its sentence.

617
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,435
So noted.

618
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,731
Captain James T. Kirk,
Dr Leonard McCoy,

619
00:49:05,815 --> 00:49:12,112
in the interest of fostering amity
for the forthcoming peace talks,

620
00:49:12,864 --> 00:49:16,366
the sentence of death is commuted.

621
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:27,127
It is the judgment of this court

622
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:32,633
that, without possibility of reprieve
or parole,

623
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,636
you be taken from this place

624
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:42,517
to the dilithium mines
on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe,

625
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:47,981
there to spend the rest of your natural lives.

626
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:57,699
Rura Penthe?

627
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:03,955
Known throughout the galaxy
as the aliens' graveyard.

628
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:07,751
Better to kill them now and get it over with.

629
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:30,118
Lieutenant,

630
00:50:31,343 --> 00:50:33,200
the torpedo hit once again, please.

631
00:50:38,741 --> 00:50:39,825
Hold.

632
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:43,328
It is Enterprise.

633
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:47,332
We fired.
That is not possible.

634
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:51,002
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.

635
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:56,133
An ancestor of mine maintained
that if you eliminate the impossible,

636
00:50:56,217 --> 00:50:57,398
whatever remains,

637
00:50:57,723 --> 00:51:00,002
however improbable, must be the truth.

638
00:51:00,555 --> 00:51:02,806
What exactly does that mean?

639
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,518
It means that if we cannot
have fired those torpedoes,

640
00:51:06,602 --> 00:51:07,845
someone else did.

641
00:51:08,229 --> 00:51:12,357
Well, they did not fire on themselves,
and there were no other ships present.

642
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:15,068
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.

643
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:16,194
Not from us!

644
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:20,699
A neutron surge that big
could only be produced by another ship.

645
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:23,034
Kronos One?

646
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,870
Too far away.

647
00:51:24,954 --> 00:51:28,957
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.

648
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:33,545
If there were a ship beneath us,
the Klingons would have seen her.

649
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,466
Would they?

650
00:51:40,678 --> 00:51:42,120
A bird-of-prey.

651
00:51:42,345 --> 00:51:44,205
A bird-of-prey.

652
00:51:47,143 --> 00:51:48,226
Cloaked?

653
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:51,354
A bird-of-prey cannot fire
when she's cloaked.

654
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:55,108
All things being equal, Mr. Scott,
I would agree.

655
00:51:55,193 --> 00:51:57,486
However, things are not equal.

656
00:51:58,154 --> 00:51:59,613
This one can.

657
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:01,656
We must inform Starfleet Command.

658
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:03,252
Inform them of what,

659
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:05,768
a new weapon that is invisible?

660
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:08,121
Raving lunatics,
that's what they'll call us.

661
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:11,416
They'll say that we're so desperate
to exonerate the Captain

662
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:13,084
that we'll say anything.

663
00:52:13,169 --> 00:52:16,421
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence,

664
00:52:16,506 --> 00:52:19,549
only a theory
which happens to fit the facts.

665
00:52:19,842 --> 00:52:22,219
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock,

666
00:52:22,762 --> 00:52:24,888
why would they fire
on their own president?

667
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:26,181
Indeed.

668
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:28,850
This ship will be searched
from bow to stern.

669
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:30,477
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.

670
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:32,938
Aye, sir.
I do not understand.

671
00:52:33,022 --> 00:52:35,732
If there was a ship underneath us,

672
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:38,652
surely the assassins
beamed aboard from that vessel,

673
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:40,153
not Enterprise.

674
00:52:40,238 --> 00:52:42,048
You're forgetting something,
Mr. Chekov.

675
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:47,410
According to our databanks,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

676
00:52:47,912 --> 00:52:50,163
If we did, the killers are here.

677
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:54,709
If we did not,
whoever altered the databanks is here.

678
00:52:54,961 --> 00:52:58,880
In either case,
what we are looking for is here.

679
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:02,300
What are we looking for, sir?

680
00:53:03,386 --> 00:53:04,761
Lieutenant?

681
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:08,098
Two pairs of gravity boots.

682
00:54:14,123 --> 00:54:17,375
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.

683
00:54:18,085 --> 00:54:22,088
There is no stockade, no guard tower,

684
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,133
no electronic frontier.

685
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:29,387
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.

686
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:35,310
Punishment means exile
from prison to the surface.

687
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:40,023
On the surface, nothing can survive.

688
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:48,198
Work well and you will be treated well.

689
00:54:49,325 --> 00:54:52,786
Work badly and you will die.

690
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,291
Oh, my God.

691
00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:29,966
The universal translator's been confiscated.

692
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:32,936
I'm sorry?

693
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:40,569
He's definitely on about something, Jim.

694
00:56:45,816 --> 00:56:47,718
If this is your spot, we'll move on.

695
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:51,988
He wants your obedience
to the brotherhood of aliens.

696
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:54,365
He's got it.
And your coat.

697
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,960
I'm afraid not. Besides, it wouldn't fit.

698
00:57:12,009 --> 00:57:13,176
Thanks.

699
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:15,887
This will help keep you warm.

700
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:20,825
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.

701
00:57:22,728 --> 00:57:23,853
How'd you know that?

702
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:26,356
We don't get many presidential assassins.

703
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,067
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Of course not,

704
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,780
but there is a reward for your death.
It figures.

705
00:57:34,406 --> 00:57:36,449
We've been set up all along.

706
00:57:36,534 --> 00:57:39,369
Somebody up there
wants you out of the way.

707
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:46,876
Nothing in here.
Nothing here.

708
00:57:47,169 --> 00:57:48,628
Any progress?
None.

709
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:51,840
We have a crew of 300
turning their own quarters inside out,

710
00:57:51,924 --> 00:57:54,300
but the killers may still be among them.

711
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:57,470
Surely they have disposed
of these boots by now.

712
00:57:58,013 --> 00:58:00,974
Would it not have been logical
to have left them on Gorkon's ship?

713
00:58:01,058 --> 00:58:03,476
Even logic must give way to physics.

714
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:06,146
Gravity had not been restored
by the time they escaped.

715
00:58:06,522 --> 00:58:07,480
Without the boots,

716
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:10,700
they would have floated off
the Klingon transporter pads.

717
00:58:11,402 --> 00:58:13,528
Why not simply vaporize them?

718
00:58:16,574 --> 00:58:17,949
Like this?

719
00:58:24,915 --> 00:58:26,207
At ease.

720
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,961
As you know, Commander Chekov,
no one can fire an unauthorized phaser

721
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:31,513
aboard a starship.

722
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,843
Suppose when they returned,
they threw the boots into the refuse.

723
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:39,003
I'm having the refuse searched.

724
00:58:39,428 --> 00:58:41,330
If my surmise is correct,

725
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,349
those boots will cling to the killers' necks

726
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:45,602
like a pair of Tiberian bats.

727
00:58:45,978 --> 00:58:47,687
They could not
make their escape without them,

728
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:50,899
nor can they simply throw them
out the window for all to see.

729
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:53,117
Those boots are here somewhere.

730
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:55,344
Did someone fire off a phaser?

731
00:58:55,654 --> 00:58:58,489
It's all right. It's nothing. It's nothing.

732
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:03,453
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us
to return to port.

733
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:07,207
Who fired that...
Mr. Scott.

734
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,210
I understand you're having difficulty
with the warp drive.

735
00:59:10,294 --> 00:59:12,212
How much time do you require for repair?

736
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:14,047
There's nothing wrong
with the bloody thing.

737
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:16,799
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock,

738
00:59:17,468 --> 00:59:19,177
the assassins will surely find a way

739
00:59:19,261 --> 00:59:21,512
to dispose of their incriminating footwear,

740
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:25,683
and we will never see
the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.

741
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:29,103
It could take weeks, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Scott.

742
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:31,397
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command

743
00:59:31,482 --> 00:59:34,150
our warp drive is inoperative.
A lie?

744
00:59:34,693 --> 00:59:35,985
An error.

745
00:59:36,654 --> 00:59:41,074
You understand we have lost all contact
with the Captain and Dr McCoy.

746
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:44,327
Yes. At the moment, they're surrounded
by a magnetic shield.

747
00:59:44,411 --> 00:59:48,081
However, if I know the Captain,
by this time,

748
00:59:48,165 --> 00:59:50,667
he is deep into planning his escape.

749
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:17,068
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!

750
01:01:09,538 --> 01:01:11,622
You all right, Jim?
I think so.

751
01:01:11,749 --> 01:01:14,125
They'll respect you now.
That's a comfort.

752
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:17,837
I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.

753
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:22,533
Not everybody keeps their genitals
in the same place, Captain.

754
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,219
Anything you want to tell me?

755
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:28,681
Bones, why don't you see
what you can do for him?

756
01:01:28,766 --> 01:01:31,476
Let him know
we're not holding a grudge.

757
01:01:31,727 --> 01:01:33,936
Suppose he's holding a grudge?

758
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:37,871
When whoever it is makes their move,

759
01:01:37,896 --> 01:01:40,467
you won't be here
to ask if he's the one.

760
01:01:45,491 --> 01:01:47,399
Do you want to get out of here?

761
01:01:47,524 --> 01:01:49,142
There's gotta be a way.

762
01:02:10,182 --> 01:02:13,518
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.

763
01:02:13,602 --> 01:02:17,230
We're not finished.
No? Speak for yourself.

764
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,692
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.

765
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:25,363
Bones, are you afraid of the future?

766
01:02:27,408 --> 01:02:32,245
I believe that was the general idea
that I was trying to convey.

767
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:34,330
I don't mean this future.

768
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:39,544
What is this, multiple choice?
Some people are afraid

769
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:43,339
of what might happen.

770
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:46,676
I was terrified.

771
01:02:47,386 --> 01:02:49,720
What terrified you, specifically?

772
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:57,895
No more neutral zone.

773
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,525
I was used to hating Klingons.

774
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:09,991
It never even occurred to me
to take Gorkon at his word.

775
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:14,787
Spock was right.

776
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:19,000
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.

777
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:20,126
No.

778
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:23,546
Somebody felt a lot worse.

779
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:27,592
I'm beginning to understand why.

780
01:03:28,177 --> 01:03:31,596
Well, if you've got any bright ideas,
now's the time.

781
01:03:31,722 --> 01:03:34,891
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.

782
01:03:36,435 --> 01:03:38,978
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.

783
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:43,191
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound
to attempt another assassination.

784
01:03:45,777 --> 01:03:48,029
Unless we can get out of here.

785
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,000
Kirk, it's me, Martia.

786
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:04,420
Listen, no one has ever escaped
from Rura Penthe.

787
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:05,984
Except us.

788
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,931
It is possible.

789
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:11,075
I know how to get outside the shield.

790
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,452
How do we fit in?

791
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,931
Getting outside the shield is easy,

792
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,768
but after that, it's up to you to get us
off the surface before we freeze.

793
01:04:18,852 --> 01:04:20,102
Can you?

794
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:24,232
It's possible.
I can't make it alone,

795
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:29,695
and you're likeliest candidate
to come in this hellhole for months.

796
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,531
Candidate for what?

797
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:49,382
Go to lift seven in the morning
for mining duty.

798
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:52,593
I'll see you there. Don't disappoint me.

799
01:04:55,973 --> 01:04:59,600
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?

800
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:01,435
More than ever.

801
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:08,776
I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
What is it?

802
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:11,070
Starfleet urgently requests
any data we have

803
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:13,614
on the whereabouts of Enterprise.

804
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:17,493
What?

805
01:05:17,628 --> 01:05:18,696
Well apparently,

806
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:21,823
they're refusing to acknowledge
signal to return to spacedock, sir.

807
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:27,731
Signal Starfleet that,

808
01:05:28,256 --> 01:05:31,239
we have no idea location Enterprise.

809
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,842
Sir?

810
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:36,079
You have hearing problems, mister?

811
01:05:36,503 --> 01:05:37,503
No, sir.

812
01:06:21,642 --> 01:06:22,642
Klingon blood.

813
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:25,853
They must have walked through it
when it was floating

814
01:06:25,937 --> 01:06:27,938
and tracked it back here.

815
01:06:29,066 --> 01:06:32,151
This is the first evidence
which corroborates our theory.

816
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:33,486
Now we go to Starfleet.

817
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:37,198
Now we expand our search
to include uniforms.

818
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,909
All uniforms?

819
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,167
Take those out.

820
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,759
Continue scanning.
Nothing, sir.

821
01:06:59,638 --> 01:07:01,013
Clear, sir.

822
01:07:02,683 --> 01:07:04,975
Coming through. Coming through.

823
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:08,854
Computer well seven clear.

824
01:07:11,692 --> 01:07:13,192
Nothing. Nothing.

825
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,613
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing. Nothing so far.

826
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:19,323
Sir! Sir!

827
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:52,451
I think we've been had.

828
01:07:53,076 --> 01:07:54,632
No, you weren't, Doctor.

829
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:57,687
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.

830
01:07:58,989 --> 01:08:00,823
They don't take girls.

831
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:13,544
You are Crewman Dax?

832
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:16,630
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?

833
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:21,844
Perhaps you know
Russian epic of Cinderella?

834
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:27,725
If shoe fits, wear it.

835
01:08:29,644 --> 01:08:31,020
Mr. Chekov.

836
01:08:46,912 --> 01:08:48,204
Watch me.

837
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:53,834
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...

838
01:08:53,919 --> 01:08:55,444
Don't remind me.

839
01:08:58,423 --> 01:08:59,632
Get in.

840
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:13,255
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.

841
01:10:31,141 --> 01:10:32,308
Hurry.

842
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:37,730
Up there.

843
01:10:40,317 --> 01:10:41,859
Come on, climb.

844
01:10:53,288 --> 01:10:55,264
Here. You'll need these. Quickly!

845
01:11:17,312 --> 01:11:18,687
Stay close.

846
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:36,724
There they are.

847
01:12:36,808 --> 01:12:39,184
They're emerging
from the beaming shield.

848
01:12:39,269 --> 01:12:41,729
Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Aye, aye, sir.

849
01:12:41,813 --> 01:12:44,523
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.

850
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:48,318
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe
is deep inside the Klingon frontier.

851
01:12:48,778 --> 01:12:51,238
If we are discovered...
Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.

852
01:12:51,322 --> 01:12:54,074
What is required now
is a feat of linguistic legerdemain

853
01:12:54,576 --> 01:12:56,160
and a degree of intrepidity

854
01:12:56,244 --> 01:12:58,829
before the Captain and Dr McCoy
freeze to death.

855
01:13:06,337 --> 01:13:08,547
Leave me. I'm finished.
No!

856
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:14,094
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch
on my back.

857
01:13:14,471 --> 01:13:18,182
Spock slapped it there
just before we went on Gorkon's ship.

858
01:13:18,641 --> 01:13:23,771
Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
Come on. We're in the clear.

859
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,399
Now that we're outside the shield,

860
01:13:27,484 --> 01:13:30,152
they'll be able to locate us
two sectors away.

861
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:32,488
If they're even looking for us.

862
01:14:02,352 --> 01:14:03,678
This is listening post Morska.

863
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:07,724
What ship is that?

864
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:11,848
What ship is that?

865
01:14:12,172 --> 01:14:13,172
Over.

866
01:14:16,396 --> 01:14:18,296
What ship is that? Over.

867
01:14:20,203 --> 01:14:21,787
We must respond personally.

868
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:24,623
A universal translator
would be recognized.

869
01:14:24,647 --> 01:14:26,647
What ship is that? Over.

870
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:30,271
<i>What ship is that? Over.</i>

871
01:14:33,716 --> 01:14:36,510
We am thy freighter Ursva.

872
01:14:38,304 --> 01:14:40,389
<i>Six weeks out of</i>

<i>What is your destination? Over.</i>

878
01:14:57,866 --> 01:14:59,792
What is your destination? Over.

879
01:15:01,716 --> 01:15:03,716
Rura Penthe.

880
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:07,916
We is condemning food,

881
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:13,530
things and supplies.

882
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:19,663
Don't catch any bugs!

883
01:15:52,295 --> 01:15:55,747
Would you mind explaining
that little trick you do?

884
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:57,646
I'm a chameloid.

885
01:15:58,671 --> 01:15:59,967
I've heard about you.

886
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:02,554
Shapeshifters.

887
01:16:04,432 --> 01:16:06,003
I thought you were mythical.

888
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,251
Give a girl a chance, Captain.

889
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,518
It takes a lot of effort.

890
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:14,791
I don't doubt it.

891
01:16:15,652 --> 01:16:17,444
Stop me if I'm wrong,

892
01:16:17,862 --> 01:16:21,782
but do we have any way of knowing
whether this is the real you?

893
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:24,977
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.

894
01:16:32,001 --> 01:16:35,620
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.

895
01:16:36,464 --> 01:16:37,965
If you say so.

896
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:41,510
Are you crazy?

897
01:16:41,678 --> 01:16:43,178
She didn't need our help
getting anywhere.

898
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:45,097
Where'd you get
these convenient clothes?

899
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:48,058
Don't tell me that flare
is standard prison issue.

900
01:16:48,518 --> 01:16:52,521
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.

901
01:16:52,605 --> 01:16:54,106
A full pardon,

902
01:16:55,358 --> 01:16:57,150
which doesn't cover this.

903
01:16:57,235 --> 01:17:00,320
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.

904
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:04,449
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.

905
01:17:05,535 --> 01:17:10,163
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.

906
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:16,128
Surprise!

907
01:17:28,141 --> 01:17:30,976
Your friends are late.
They'll be along.

908
01:17:34,522 --> 01:17:38,775
I can't believe I kissed you.
Must have been your lifelong ambition.

909
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:56,668
Isn't it about time
you became something else?

910
01:17:56,753 --> 01:17:58,295
I like it here.

911
01:18:07,388 --> 01:18:10,640
Well, well, well.

912
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:20,275
What took you so long?

913
01:18:21,694 --> 01:18:25,447
Kill him. He's the one.
Not me, you idiot. Him!

914
01:18:28,326 --> 01:18:31,620
No witnesses.
Killed while trying to escape.

915
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:35,749
Damn clever, if you ask me.
It's a classic.

916
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:39,419
That's what he wanted.
Who? Who wanted us killed?

917
01:18:40,046 --> 01:18:43,965
Since you're all going to die anyway,
why not tell you?

918
01:18:44,509 --> 01:18:46,009
His name is...

919
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:56,603
Damn it to hell! Of all the... Son of a...

920
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:59,064
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
Captain?

921
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:01,274
He was just about to explain
the whole thing.

922
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:02,651
You want to go back?

923
01:19:02,735 --> 01:19:05,237
Absolutely not!
It's cold.

924
01:19:06,823 --> 01:19:09,741
<i>This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.</i>

925
01:19:09,826 --> 01:19:14,871
<i>Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.</i>

926
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:49,607
<i>They were beamed aboard,</i>

927
01:19:50,859 --> 01:19:52,643
<i>a Federation starship.</i>

928
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,067
Escaped.

929
01:19:58,901 --> 01:20:00,985
Escaped.

930
01:20:03,296 --> 01:20:07,566
Kirk cannot know the location
of the peace conference.

931
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,486
Are you sure?

932
01:20:11,554 --> 01:20:14,290
Will you take that chance?

933
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:16,234
Helmsman!
Sir.

934
01:20:16,259 --> 01:20:18,260
Make course to intercept Enterprise.
Yes Sir.

935
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,027
The Klingons have a new weapon,

936
01:20:27,111 --> 01:20:29,029
a bird-of-prey that can fire
when cloaked.

937
01:20:29,113 --> 01:20:31,364
She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
So that's it.

938
01:20:31,449 --> 01:20:34,075
Not entirely. I have reason to believe
that Gorkon's murderers

939
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,912
are aboard this vessel.
I have a thought about that.

940
01:20:36,996 --> 01:20:38,371
Has the peace conference begun?

941
01:20:38,456 --> 01:20:40,248
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.

942
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,167
There's always something.
Captain!

943
01:20:42,585 --> 01:20:47,047
Mr. Spock! I found the missing uniforms
with the Klingon blood on them.

944
01:21:02,438 --> 01:21:05,899
But the uniforms belong
to these two men,

945
01:21:05,983 --> 01:21:08,235
Burke and Samno.

946
01:21:08,653 --> 01:21:12,239
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.

947
01:21:12,323 --> 01:21:15,534
First rule of assassination,
kill the assassins.

948
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:19,788
Now we're back to square one.
Can I talk to you?

949
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:25,043
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.

950
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:28,171
It would set off the alarm.

951
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:36,805
It's possible.

952
01:21:37,515 --> 01:21:40,594

01:22:39,869 --> 01:22:41,536
You have to shoot.

960
01:22:45,374 --> 01:22:49,377
If you are logical, you have to shoot.

961
01:22:54,175 --> 01:22:55,467
I do not want to.

962
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:59,220
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.

963
01:23:00,348 --> 01:23:02,215
I'd just as soon you didn't.

964
01:23:10,107 --> 01:23:11,983
The operation is over.

965
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:19,405
I did not fire.

966
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:21,700
You cannot prove anything.

967
01:23:21,869 --> 01:23:22,926
Yes, I can.

968
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:26,622
At my trial, my personal
log was used against me.

969
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:30,735
How long did you wait outside
my quarters before I noticed you?

970
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:33,947
You knew?

971
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,102
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.

972
01:23:40,346 --> 01:23:42,873
Neither of us was hearing
very well that night, Lieutenant.

973
01:23:43,557 --> 01:23:47,102
There were things I tried to tell you
about having faith.

974
01:23:47,353 --> 01:23:49,471
You have betrayed the Federation.

975
01:23:50,773 --> 01:23:52,148
All of you.

976
01:23:52,358 --> 01:23:54,025
And what do you think you've been doing?

977
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:55,450
Saving Starfleet.

978
01:23:55,975 --> 01:23:58,061
Klingons cannot be trusted.

979
01:23:58,948 --> 01:24:00,031
Sir.

980
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:04,452
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.

981
01:24:05,162 --> 01:24:08,456
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
Let them die, you said.

982
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:10,458
Did I misinterpret you?

983
01:24:13,337 --> 01:24:15,088
And you were right.

984
01:24:16,006 --> 01:24:19,718
They conspired with us
to assassinate their own chancellor.

985
01:24:19,802 --> 01:24:21,970
How trustworthy can they be?

986
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:26,057
Klingons and Federation members
conspiring together?

987
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:27,892
Who is us?

988
01:24:27,977 --> 01:24:30,645
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.

989
01:24:31,147 --> 01:24:34,899
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain

990
01:24:34,984 --> 01:24:38,236
all your ship-to-shore transmissions
are jammed.

991
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,988
Names, Lieutenant.

992
01:24:40,489 --> 01:24:42,699
I do not remember.

993
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:46,995
A lie?

994
01:24:48,956 --> 01:24:50,206
A choice.

995
01:24:54,962 --> 01:24:56,129
Spock?

996
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:43,468
Admiral Cartwright.

997
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,221
From Starfleet?

998
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:55,480
Who else?

999
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:02,195
General...
General...

1000
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:04,906
Chang.
Chang.

1001
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:12,247
Who else?

1002
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,666
Romulan...
Romulan...

1003
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,501
Ambassador...
Ambassador...

1004
01:26:16,585 --> 01:26:18,253
Nanclus.
Nanclus.

1005
01:26:22,091 --> 01:26:24,342
Where is the peace conference?

1006
01:26:26,595 --> 01:26:28,547
Where is the peace conference?

1007
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:04,424
She does not know.

1008
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:08,469
Then we're dead.

1009
01:27:19,064 --> 01:27:22,317
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.

1010
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:27,780
She'll have the coordinates.
I've already got him, sir.

1011
01:27:28,908 --> 01:27:30,408
<i>Standing by, Captain Kirk.</i>

1012
01:27:30,492 --> 01:27:31,576
Sulu!

1013
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:36,205
You realize that by even talking to us,
you're violating regulations.

1014
01:27:36,332 --> 01:27:39,167
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.</i>

1015
01:27:39,251 --> 01:27:42,337
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?

1016
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,131
They're going to attempt
another assassination.

1017
01:27:45,215 --> 01:27:48,968
<i>The conference is at Camp Khitomer,
near the Romulan border.</i>

1018
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:53,264
<i>I'm sending the exact coordinates
on a coded frequency.</i>

1019
01:27:53,349 --> 01:27:55,150
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.

1020
01:27:55,434 --> 01:27:57,977
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us,

1021
01:27:58,062 --> 01:27:59,604
and she can fire while cloaked.

1022
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:01,105
<i>Surely not.</i>

1023
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,867
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?

1024
01:28:04,485 --> 01:28:06,235
Come on, Lieutenant.

1025
01:28:06,862 --> 01:28:09,672
Just the prototype.
You hear that?

1026
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:13,785
<i>I'm getting underway now,
but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.</i>

1027
01:28:13,869 --> 01:28:17,246
<i>The chances of our reaching
the conference in time are slim.</i>

1028
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:19,666
When does this conference start?

1029
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,251
<i>According to my information, today.</i>

1030
01:28:23,587 --> 01:28:25,280
Thank you, Captain Sulu.

1031
01:28:25,589 --> 01:28:27,190
<i>Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.</i>

1032
01:28:33,889 --> 01:28:35,056
Spock?

1033
01:28:36,475 --> 01:28:38,101
I prefer it dark.

1034
01:28:45,401 --> 01:28:46,985
Dining on ashes?

1035
01:28:47,945 --> 01:28:49,387
You were right.

1036
01:28:49,905 --> 01:28:55,326
It was arrogant presumption on my part
that got us into this situation.

1037
01:28:57,246 --> 01:28:59,881
You and the doctor
might have been killed.

1038
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:02,500
The night is young.

1039
01:29:03,419 --> 01:29:07,622
You said it yourself. It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.

1040
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:14,012
You're a great one for logic.

1041
01:29:14,096 --> 01:29:17,724
I'm a great one for rushing in
where angels fear to tread.

1042
01:29:19,393 --> 01:29:21,069
We're both extremists.

1043
01:29:21,645 --> 01:29:24,689
Reality is probably
somewhere in between.

1044
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:32,530
I couldn't get past the death of my son.

1045
01:29:32,948 --> 01:29:36,993
I was prejudiced
by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.

1046
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,789
Gorkon had to die before I understood
how prejudiced I was.

1047
01:29:49,673 --> 01:29:54,093
Is it possible that we two, you and I,

1048
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:59,390
have grown so old and so inflexible

1049
01:30:00,309 --> 01:30:02,894
that we have outlived our usefulness?

1050
01:30:05,147 --> 01:30:07,690
Would that constitute a joke?

1051
01:30:09,193 --> 01:30:11,402
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

1052
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:13,154
I was responsible.

1053
01:30:14,531 --> 01:30:18,868
For no actions but your own.
That is not what you said at your trial.

1054
01:30:20,162 --> 01:30:22,413
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...

1055
01:30:22,498 --> 01:30:25,792
But, Captain, we both know
that I am not human.

1056
01:30:26,293 --> 01:30:29,670
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.

1057
01:30:30,714 --> 01:30:33,841
I find that remark insulting.

1058
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,427
Come on. I need you.

1059
01:30:40,974 --> 01:30:42,400
<i>Madam Chancellor,</i>

1060
01:30:43,477 --> 01:30:45,727
<i>members of the Diplomatic Corps,</i>

1061
01:30:46,252 --> 01:30:47,712
<i>honored guests,</i>

1062
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:53,277
<i>the United Federation of Planets
welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.</i>

1063
01:31:10,504 --> 01:31:12,755
She's out here somewhere.

1064
01:31:13,215 --> 01:31:15,174
But if she is cloaked...

1065
01:31:15,801 --> 01:31:17,969
Then all we have
is a neutron radiation surge,

1066
01:31:18,053 --> 01:31:21,139
and by the time we're close enough
to record it, we're ashes.

1067
01:31:21,223 --> 01:31:22,640
209.

1068
01:31:25,644 --> 01:31:26,853
206.

1069
01:31:30,482 --> 01:31:31,983
203.

1070
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:34,916
Close enough to beam down?

1071
01:31:35,141 --> 01:31:36,844
Not yet, Captain.
In two minutes.

1072
01:31:37,169 --> 01:31:38,446
158.

1073
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:43,094
Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
Aye, sir.

1074
01:31:52,296 --> 01:31:57,633
<i>Let us redefine progress to mean
that just because we can do a thing,</i>

1075
01:31:57,718 --> 01:32:02,138
<i>it does not necessarily follow
that we must do that thing.</i>

1076
01:32:05,934 --> 01:32:08,019
Uhura?
Nothing, Captain.

1077
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,814
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.

1078
01:32:18,697 --> 01:32:21,782
<i>Coming up on transporter range
in 57 seconds.</i>

1079
01:32:22,784 --> 01:32:25,453
<i>Transporter Room,
stand by to beam down.</i>

1080
01:32:28,624 --> 01:32:29,665
<i>53...</i>

1081
01:32:34,504 --> 01:32:35,880
<i>48 seconds.</i>

1082
01:32:41,386 --> 01:32:42,428
<i>44...</i>

1083
01:32:45,724 --> 01:32:47,558
<i>I can see you, Kirk.</i>

1084
01:32:49,478 --> 01:32:50,645
Chang.

1085
01:32:51,813 --> 01:32:53,356
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1086
01:32:54,524 --> 01:32:58,569
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior,

1087
01:32:59,363 --> 01:33:03,115
<i>you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.</i>

1088
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:06,035
<i>No peace in our time.</i>

1089
01:33:06,745 --> 01:33:11,499
<i>Once more unto the breach,
dear friends.</i>

1090
01:33:27,516 --> 01:33:30,768
This is fun.
Reverse engines. All astern.

1091
01:33:30,852 --> 01:33:32,090
<i>One and a half impulse power.</i>

1092
01:33:32,114 --> 01:33:33,245
Back off! Back off!

1093
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,027
What's she doing?

1094
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:42,697
What's she waiting for?

1095
01:33:43,699 --> 01:33:47,118
Probably attempting to ascertain
why we are reversing,

1096
01:33:47,536 --> 01:33:49,870
wondering whether we detect her.

1097
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:56,460
Incoming!

1098
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:03,467
In range?
Not yet, sir.

1099
01:34:03,552 --> 01:34:04,969
Come on. Come on.

1100
01:34:05,053 --> 01:34:07,054
She'll fly apart.
Fly her apart, then!

1101
01:34:07,639 --> 01:34:09,051
<i>Many speculated,</i>

1102
01:34:09,576 --> 01:34:11,458
<i>about my father's motives.</i>

1103
01:34:12,728 --> 01:34:15,488
<i>There were those who said
he was an idealist.</i>

1104
01:34:15,856 --> 01:34:18,065
<i>Others said he had no choice.</i>

1105
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:22,403
<i>If Praxis had not exploded,
then quite possibly his idealism</i>

1106
01:34:22,654 --> 01:34:24,947
<i>would not have found expression.</i>

1107
01:34:25,372 --> 01:34:27,223
<i>We are a proud race,</i>

1108
01:34:27,784 --> 01:34:32,496
<i>and we are here because
we intend to go on being proud.</i>

1109
01:34:42,382 --> 01:34:46,427
Go to auxiliary power!
Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.

1110
01:34:52,434 --> 01:34:56,437
Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?

1111
01:34:57,105 --> 01:34:58,439
Wrong us,

1112
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:01,525
shall we not revenge?

1113
01:35:02,486 --> 01:35:03,569
Gas.

1114
01:35:05,489 --> 01:35:09,992
Gas, Captain. Under impulse power,
she expends fuel like any other vessel.

1115
01:35:10,327 --> 01:35:13,420
We call it plasma, but whatever
the Klingon designation,

1116
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:15,673
it is merely ionized gas.

1117
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:18,709
Well, what about all
of that equipment we're carrying

1118
01:35:18,794 --> 01:35:20,961
to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

1119
01:35:23,256 --> 01:35:27,885
Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
Doctor, would you care to assist me

1120
01:35:27,969 --> 01:35:31,305
in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.

1121
01:35:33,183 --> 01:35:34,850
Hard to starboard!

1122
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:41,273
<i>The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos</i>

1123
01:35:41,358 --> 01:35:45,111
<i>has been calculated
within the 50-Earth-year time span.</i>

1124
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:47,696
<i>Phase one, preparation for evacuation.</i>

1125
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:56,163
Come on, reach up!

1126
01:35:57,999 --> 01:36:00,663
Captain! She's packing quite a wallop!

1127
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:01,985
Shields weakening!

1128
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:11,846
Shields up. All right.

1129
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:13,848
Now we've given them
something else to shoot at.

1130
01:36:13,932 --> 01:36:15,182
Aye, sir.

1131
01:36:21,857 --> 01:36:23,732
The game's afoot, huh?

1132
01:36:32,033 --> 01:36:33,390
Excelsior's been hit.

1133
01:36:33,414 --> 01:36:36,061
<i>Our revels now are ended, Kirk.</i>

1134
01:36:44,963 --> 01:36:49,884
Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of war.

1135
01:36:51,011 --> 01:36:51,822
Bones!

1136
01:36:51,947 --> 01:36:53,078
<i>Where's my torpedo?</i>

1137
01:36:53,138 --> 01:36:54,805
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.

1138
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:56,974
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!

1139
01:36:57,058 --> 01:36:58,767
Shields collapsing!

1140
01:37:01,062 --> 01:37:03,189
The key, please, Doctor. Time is short.

1141
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:13,407
The hull has been compromised.

1142
01:37:13,492 --> 01:37:16,076
I wonder how bad?
Connect echobars.

1143
01:37:16,203 --> 01:37:18,787
<i>To discuss the report on phase two.</i>

1144
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,916
Alter circuit A.
Sensor.

1145
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:25,169
<i>I propose that we commence
with the minutes of the preparation.</i>

1146
01:37:25,462 --> 01:37:28,172
<i>I am constant as the northern star.</i>

1147
01:37:28,256 --> 01:37:30,799
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.

1148
01:37:30,926 --> 01:37:32,218
Plate, please.
Plate.

1149
01:37:32,302 --> 01:37:34,053
<i>And assimilation will consume...</i>

1150
01:37:34,137 --> 01:37:36,013
We've got a heartbeat.

1151
01:37:37,182 --> 01:37:39,183
<i>The Klingon empire, the ecological...</i>

1152
01:37:39,476 --> 01:37:41,060
Key, please.
Key.

1153
01:37:41,144 --> 01:37:42,561
<i>Where's that damn torpedo?</i>

1154
01:37:42,646 --> 01:37:44,980
She's ready, Jim. Lock and load.

1155
01:37:47,609 --> 01:37:48,734
Fire.

1156
01:38:01,581 --> 01:38:02,790
To be,

1157
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:04,667
or not

1158
01:38:05,502 --> 01:38:06,794
to be.

1159
01:38:08,547 --> 01:38:10,631
Target that explosion and fire.

1160
01:38:12,592 --> 01:38:13,592
Fire.

1161
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:26,397
<i>As I imagine this work will occupy us</i>

1162
01:38:26,481 --> 01:38:29,358
<i>throughout most of the week,
it would be my hope</i>

1163
01:38:29,442 --> 01:38:31,860
<i>that the delegation
could return to their capitals</i>

1164
01:38:31,945 --> 01:38:34,363
<i>to implement the provisions
of phase one,</i>

1165
01:38:34,447 --> 01:38:36,699
<i>no later than the first of next month.</i>

1166
01:38:36,783 --> 01:38:37,783
Scotty.

1167
01:38:37,867 --> 01:38:40,369
<i>As you know, time is of the essence.</i>

1168
01:38:41,329 --> 01:38:43,664
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

1169
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:46,584
Mr. President!

1170
01:38:48,503 --> 01:38:50,713
Mr. President! Mr. President!

1171
01:38:51,673 --> 01:38:53,173
Mr. President!

1172
01:38:55,102 --> 01:38:56,427
Kirk, Enterprise.

1173
01:38:59,097 --> 01:39:00,598
Protect the Chancellor!

1174
01:39:08,064 --> 01:39:10,566
Arrest those men!
Arrest yourself.

1175
01:39:15,822 --> 01:39:17,948
We've got a full confession.

1176
01:39:33,048 --> 01:39:35,049
Cartwright, just a minute.

1177
01:39:37,385 --> 01:39:38,399
What's happened?

1178
01:39:38,424 --> 01:39:40,703
What's the meaning of all of this?

1179
01:39:41,139 --> 01:39:43,891
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.

1180
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:46,711
Some people think the future
means the end of history.

1181
01:39:47,395 --> 01:39:48,396
Well,

1182
01:39:49,221 --> 01:39:51,622
we haven't run out of history quite yet.

1183
01:39:53,902 --> 01:39:56,971
Your father called the future,

1184
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,240
the undiscovered country.

1185
01:40:03,745 --> 01:40:06,413
People can be very frightened of change.

1186
01:40:11,419 --> 01:40:13,879
You've restored my father's faith.

1187
01:40:14,798 --> 01:40:17,007
And you've restored my son's.

1188
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:08,726
Once again, we've saved civilization
as we know it.

1189
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:11,270
And the good news is,
they're not going to prosecute.

1190
01:41:11,354 --> 01:41:15,232
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.

1191
01:41:15,316 --> 01:41:18,193
Well, they don't arrest people
for having feelings.

1192
01:41:18,278 --> 01:41:19,886
And it's a good thing, too.

1193
01:41:19,911 --> 01:41:22,889
If they did, we'd all have
to turn ourselves in.

1194
01:41:24,993 --> 01:41:26,452
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

1195
01:41:26,995 --> 01:41:28,454
Captain Sulu.

1196
01:41:29,414 --> 01:41:33,125
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,
I owe you my thanks.

1197
01:41:33,793 --> 01:41:37,212
<i>Nice to see you in action
one more time, Captain Kirk.</i>

1198
01:41:37,797 --> 01:41:39,131
<i>Take care.</i>

1199
01:41:51,269 --> 01:41:53,353
By God, that's a big ship.

1200
01:41:53,813 --> 01:41:56,252
Not so big as her captain, I think.

1201
01:41:56,377 --> 01:41:57,398
So...

1202
01:41:58,623 --> 01:42:00,101
this is goodbye.

1203
01:42:01,321 --> 01:42:04,181
I think it's about time
we got underway ourselves.

1204
01:42:04,365 --> 01:42:07,743
Captain, I have orders
from Starfleet Command.

1205
01:42:07,827 --> 01:42:10,437
We're to put back
to spacedock immediately,

1206
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:12,414
to be decommissioned.

1207
01:42:27,597 --> 01:42:29,223
If I were human,

1208
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:32,226
I believe my response would be,

1209
01:42:33,436 --> 01:42:34,795
Go to hell.

1210
01:42:38,691 --> 01:42:40,275
If I were human.

1211
01:42:44,656 --> 01:42:46,615
Course heading, Captain?

1212
01:42:52,831 --> 01:42:54,915
Second star to the right,

1213
01:42:56,751 --> 01:42:58,877
and straight on till morning.
