星空奇遇第六集

2
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,830
未来之城

3
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,040
星历9521．6
Stardate 9521.6.

00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,210
船长日志，上进号由苏路指挥
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior. Hikaru Sulu commanding.

5
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,250
我首次完成三年的船长任务
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel -

6
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,290
记载第二区的气体反常现象
- cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.

7
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,520
我们正全速返回基地
We're heading home under full impulse power.

8
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,390
太空船和船员一切正常
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.

9
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,940
我们己完成全区的调查工作
According to this,we've completed our survey of the entire sector.

10
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,280
这里有强度240的能量流
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.

11
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,390
看！
Visual!

12
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,920
天！
My… God!

13
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,450
快开防护罩！
Shields. Shields!

14
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,510
太空船没有反应
She's not answering her helm.

15
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,610
右边推进器，转入气流中
Starboard thrusters. Turn her into the wave.

16
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,280
撞击力真大
Go to impulse power.

17
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,650
―损毁报告―检查所有系统
- Damage report. - Checking all systems.

18
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,330
不是有流星雨吧―不是
- That was no meteor shower. - Negative,sir.

19
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,210
子空间震动来自323．75方位
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.

20
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,640
位置是普拉西斯，克林冈卫星
Location… It's Praxis,sir. It's a Klingon moon.

21
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,840
那是他们主要的能源产地
Praxis is their key energy production facility.

22
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,550
发讯给克林冈指挥部说我们是星盟
Send to Klingon High Command. “This is Excelsior,a Federation Starship.”

23
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,360
测出他们区内发生大爆炸
“We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.”

24
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,900
问他们是否需要援助―知道
- “Do you require assistance?” - Aye,sir.

25
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,900
―有其他资料吗?―我确定了它的位置，但…
- Mr Vultane,any more data? - I've confirmed Praxis' location,but…

26
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,870
-无法确定它的存在―放出来看
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence. - On screen.

27
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,440
放大
- Magnify. - Computer enhancement.

28
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,280
―这就是普拉西斯?―对
- Praxis? - What's left of it,sir.

29
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,950
我收到普拉西斯的讯息
Captain,I'm getting a message from Praxis.

30
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,320
接过来
Let's have it.

31
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,400
我是卡拉，指挥部发言人
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.

32
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,070
普拉西斯的确有事发生
There has been an incident on Praxis.

33
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,980
但一切己恢复正常，不需援助
However,everything is under control. We have no need for assistance.

34
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,590
遵守条约规定，别进入中立区
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.

35
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,620
通讯完毕
This transmission ends now.

36
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,430
―有事发生?―我们要报告此事吗？
- An incident? - Do we report this,sir?

37
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,190
笑话
Are you kidding?

38
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,470
（舰队总部）

39
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,440
―我们为什么要来?―可能是退休派对
- What are we doing here? - Maybe it's a retirement party.

40
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,480
真好，我刚买了小船
That suits me. I just bought a boat.

41
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,510
我本来要开学术会议
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.

42
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,710
―这是高层人员会议吗―苏路呢?
- Isn't this just for top brass? - Where is Sulu?

43
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,120
―苏路有任务在身―那冼朴呢?
Captain Sulu? On assignment. Where's Spock?

44
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,190
这次议程要保密，有请总司令
This briefing is classified. Ladies and gentlemen,the C-in-C.

45
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,100
请坐
As you were.

46
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,020
让我简述一下
I'll break this information down succinctly.

47
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,660
克林冈帝国只剩下五十年寿命
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.

48
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,360
详细情况由星盟特使交代
For full details,I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation Special Envoy.

49
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,340
大家早
Good morning.

50
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:08,610
我们两个月前测出普拉西斯发生爆炸
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.

51
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,580
可能因为采矿过度及安全设施不足
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.

52
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,550
卫星爆炸导致臭氧层严重污染
The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their ozone.

53
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,790
他们的氧气在五十年内就会耗尽
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.

54
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,870
由于军事开支太大
Due to their enormous military budget -

55
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,700
克林冈人没有经济能力应付这场灾难
- the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.

56
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,470
上月，应维冈总理要求
Last month,at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador,-

57
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,580
我与克林冈总理高冈对话
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.

58
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,550
他建议马上展开谈判
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.

59
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,590
谈什么?
Negotiations for what?

60
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,560
解散中立区的太空站
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone.

61
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,890
结束七十年敌对状态
An end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.

62
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,700
我们要星际舰队作后备？
Bill,are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?

63
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,400
这不影响我们的科学探测计划
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected,but…

64
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,940
我一定反对
I must protest!

65
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,340
在星盟范围内庇护克林冈人等于自杀
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.

66
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,420
他们会变成银河系的外星垃圾
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.

67
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,350
如果解散舰队
If we dismantle the fleet,-

68
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,680
我们就无力对抗敌人
- we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.

69
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,590
我们一定要使他们屈服
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.

70
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,590
才能发号施令
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.

71
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,530
-长官 -却克船长？
- Sir… - Captain Kirk?

72
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,800
克林冈人从不可靠
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.

73
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,170
我同意卡上将的观点这个做法太恐布了
I agree with Admiral Cartwright. This is a terrifying idea.

74
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,720
当前急务是要支持高冈
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative,-

75
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,150
免得克林冈的保守势力…
- lest more conservative elements persuade his empire -

76
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,780
煽动战争
- that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.

77
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,320
却克船长，你是首个和平大使
You,Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.

78
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,130
我们要会合高冈的太空船
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth -

79
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,170
全程安全护送他
- and to escort him safely through Federation space.

80
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,070
我？
Me?

81
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,010
你和克林冈人对和约有同感
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself,-

82
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,770
有你指挥他们不会轻易攻击企业号
- but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.

83
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,320
我私人担保你负责这项任务
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.

84
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,150
你私人担保？
You have personally vouched…?

85
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,890
你要以十足外交礼节款待高冈
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy,Captain.

86
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,160
―我要有经验的大使――没有其他问题的话
- A full Ambassador is better equipped… - If there's no further business…

87
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,770
我预祝你成功，散会
…I wish you and your crew Godspeed. Thank you,ladies and gentlemen.

88
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,700
紧记这个会议要保密
I remind you this meeting is classified.

89
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,570
我不知应否恭喜你
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not,Jim.

90
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,880
我不会恭喜你
I wouldn't.

91
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,120
我们是自愿的？
We volunteered?

92
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,290
维冈人有句俗语；尼克逊才可到中国去
There's an old Vulcan proverb. “Only Nixon could go to China.”

93
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,300
你怎能担保我？
How could you vouch for me?

94
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,370
―那是我自作主张―我父亲要求我展开谈判
- That's arrogant presumption. - My father requested that I open…

95
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,980
我知道你父亲是维冈大使但你知道我的感受吗?
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador,but you know how I feel.

96
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,240
―他们是野兽―却克
- They're animals. - Jim…

97
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,590
―这是难得的机会―别相信他们!
- There is an historic opportunity here. - Don't believe them! Don't trust them.

98
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,950
―他们快死了―让他们自生自灭
- They're dying. - Let them die.

99
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,300
舰队三个月内就要解散了
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?

100
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,130
我们一直为此而努力
We've done our bit for king and country.

101
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,060
你该相信我
You should have trusted me.

102
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,080
控制台，这是S―D103接近太空码头
Control,this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock. Over.

103
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:09,850
接却克船长及队员到NCC1701
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.

104
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,460
-船长到了 -你是少校…
- Captain on the bridge! - As you were. Lieutenant…?

105
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,330
韦利丽，我自荐做舵手的
Val'eris,sir. We were told you needed a helmsman,so I volunteered.

106
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,270
很高兴再见到你
It is agreeable to see you again.

107
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,970
她是首个维冈人高材生
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.

108
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,440
―你一定很自豪―不是
- You must be very proud. - I don't believe so,sir.

109
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,140
她是维冈人
She's a Vulcan,alright.

110
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,310
我们开始吧，离境站
Let's get this over with. Departure stations.

111
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,690
史葛，找到引擎室吗？―找到了
- Scotty? Did you find the engine room? - Right where I left it.

112
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,690
准备，乌娜，替我接码头职员
Stand by. Uhura,get me the dock master.

113
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,560
控制台读数
Control tower reading,sir.

114
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,530
控制台，企业号申请离境
Control,this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.

115
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,570
申请获接纳，离闸门有三十秒
This is Control. Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.

116
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,200
-清除船索 -在此等候
- Clear all moorings. - Awaiting port gates from this mark.

117
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,210
-船索清除了 -后推进器
- All lines clear. - Aft thrusters.

118
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,780
谢谢，要1/4动力
Thank you,Lieutenant. 1 quarter impulse power.

119
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:17,650
船长，推进器只限在码头上用
Captain,regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.

120
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,190
却克…
Jim…

121
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,730
按指示做
You heard the order,Lieutenant.

122
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,690
知道
Aye,sir.

123
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,100
船长日志，星历98522．6
Captain's log. Stardate 9522.6.

124
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,970
我从不信任克林冈人
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.

125
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,540
他们害死我儿子，不能原谅
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.

126
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,520
护送克林冈总理到和平高峰会
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit -

127
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,260
真是棘手的工作
- is problematic,at best.

128
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,440
冼朴说这是历史性时刻希望他对吧
Spock says this could be an historic occasion. I'd like to believe him.

129
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,200
但我怎能担当这历史重任?
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?

130
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,570
-对不起 -你该敲门
- Sorry. - You could have knocked.

131
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,150
快到会合处了，我特来报告
We are almost at the rendezvous,sir. I thought that you would like to know.

132
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,990
船长，我很荣幸能为你效劳
Permission to speak freely,sir. It is an honour to serve with you.

133
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,730
你的太空驾驶技术不错
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.

134
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,530
这是我的志愿
I've always wanted to try that.

135
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,350
做得好
You've done well,Val'eris.

136
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,590
我对你的工作表现很满意
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.

137
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,290
你比我预期中还出色
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.

138
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,430
这幅画代表什么?
I do not understand this representation.

139
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,270
是古时地球传说的描绘
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.

140
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,910
；被逐出天堂-
“The expulsion from Paradise.”

141
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,350
―为什么要挂在房里?―提醒自己一切也会完
- Why keep it in your quarters? - To remind me that all things end.

142
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,820
我很想说出这个结局
It is of endings that I wish to speak.

143
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,420
我视你为我们族中的智者
Sir,I address you as a kindred intellect.

144
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,300
你察觉到…
Do you not recognise…

145
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,270
星盟出现转捩点吗？
…that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?

146
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,140
历史充满转捩点，怀着信心
History is replete with turning points. You must have faith.

147
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,510
―信心?―宇宙正在发展
- Faith? - The universe will unfold as it should.

148
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,520
―合逻辑吗?我们肯定…―合逻辑…
- Is that logical? Surely we must… - Logic,logic,logic.

149
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,490
逻辑是智慧之始，不是终结
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris. Not the end.

150
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,370
这是我最后一次乘太空船
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.

151
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,570
位置不能空着
Nature abhors a vacuum.

152
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,340
我想由你继任
I intend you to replace me.

153
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,650
我会好好接替你的工作
I could only succeed you,sir.

154
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,200
所有人员请到驾驶台
Now hear this. All officers to the bridge.

155
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,670
克林冈巡航机离开了码头所有人员请到驾驶台
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow. All Officers to the bridge.

156
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,420
船长到了
Captain on the bridge!

157
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,760
要开防护罩吗？
Shall we raise our shields,Captain?

158
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,810
从未如此接近过
I've never been this close.

159
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,170
总理在等候指示
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.

160
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,390
乌娜，打信号招呼―知道
- Uhura,hailing frequencies. - Aye,sir.

161
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,860
用右舵靠过去
Right standard rudder. Bring us alongside.

162
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,970
右舵z加5度
Right standard rudder. Z plus 5 degrees.

163
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,930
接通了
Channel is open,Captain.

164
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,400
这是企业号太空船由却克船长指挥
This is the Starship Enterprise. Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

165
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,710
这是卡龙诺斯一号我是高冈总理
This is Kronos One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.

166
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,290
我们奉命护送你到地球开会
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.

167
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,010
谢谢
Thank you.

168
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,360
你们想来企业号进晚餐吗?
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise -

169
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,660
来星盟作客好吗?
- as guests of the United Federation of Planets?

170
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,700
我们乐意接受邀请
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.

171
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,610
我们七点半安排你们上船
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.

172
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,140
我热切期待
I shall look forward to that.

173
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,680
你满意了吧
I hope you're happy.

174
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,620
船长，我们有麦芽酒
Captain! There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.

175
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,060
有助聚会顺利进行
It might make the evening pass more… smoothly.

176
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,930
好主意
Officer thinking,Lieutenant.

177
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,290
你猜谁会来？
Guess who's coming to dinner.

178
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,080
通电
Energize.

179
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,780
-高冈总理 -切克船长
- Chancellor Gorkon. - Captain Kirk.

180
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,580
这是冼朴，你见过的
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.

181
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,420
我们终于见面了，谢谢你
Captain,face to face at last. You have my thanks.

182
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
总理
Chancellor.

183
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,130
各位
Gentlemen.

184
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,330
这是我的女儿阿惜宝
This is my daughter,Azetbur…

185
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,180
我的军事顾问卡拉
My military advisor,Brigadier Kerla…

186
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,210
这是总参谋长张上将
…and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.

187
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,620
久仰大名
I have so wanted to meet you,Captain.

188
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,360
―过奖了―他真的很仰慕你
- I'm not sure how to take that. - Sincere admiration,Kirk.

189
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,720
战士之间的感情
From one warrior to another.

190
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,000
对
Right…

191
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,840
请来这边参观一下
This way. You might enjoy a brief tour.

192
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,720
―他们的长相全都差不多―还有那股气味
- They all look alike. - What about that smell?

193
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,800
只有首领才能说话
You know only top of the line models can even talk…

194
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,370
-你们有工作做吗？ -有
- You men have work? - Yes,ma'am.

195
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,560
快去办事
Then snap to it.

196
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,050
齐来干杯
I offer a toast.

197
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,840
为尚未发现的地方
The undiscovered country.

198
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,490
―为未来 -为尚未发现的地方
- The future. - The undiscovered country.

199
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,890
哈姆雷特第三幕第一场
Hamlet,act 3,scene 1.

200
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:54,260
看过克林冈文的莎士比亚才知道个中乐趣
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.

201
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,300
麦芽酒不是非法的吗？
Captain Kirk. I thought Romulan ale was illegal.

202
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,450
离星盟总部还有一千光年没有问题
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.

203
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,580
敬高冈总理一杯他是我们未来的栋梁
To you,Chancellor Gorkon. One of the architects of our future.

204
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,220
为总理干杯
Chancellor!

205
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,930
可能我们现在己看到未来
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.

206
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:34,200
却克，你愿放弃星际舰队吗?
Tell me,Captain Kirk. Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?

207
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:44,540
船长认为舰队做的是和平任务
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.

208
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,120
我没有异议，舰队一向…
I wouldn't dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always been…

209
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:57,200
不用转弯抹角太空所有战士也很冷酷
There's no need to mince words. In space,all warriors are cold warriors.

210
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,840
你喜欢莎士比亚吗？
General, are you fond of… Shakespeare?

211
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,480
我们认为所有星球也该争取不可剥夺的人权
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.

212
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,340
不可剥夺，你们只听取己见
“Inalien…” If you could only hear yourselves.

213
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,320
人权一词有种族歧视之意
“Human rights.” Why,the very name is racist.

214
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,360
星盟不再是智人的专利
The Federation is a “homo sapiens only” club.

215
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,860
现时的同伴除外
Present company excepted,of course.

216
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:34,090
我们的文化会因此毁灭
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.

217
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,730
不对…
That's not true. No!

218
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,710
做与不做是困扰我们的问题
“To be or not to be”…That is the question which preoccupies our people.

219
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,240
―我们需要呼吸空间―地球，希特拉，1938年
- We need breathing room. - Earth. Hitler,1938.

220
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,340
你说什么?
I beg your pardon?

221
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,390
好了…
Well…

222
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,590
我们要走的路还漫长
I see we have a long way to go.

223
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,460
欢迎下次再来
We must do this again sometime.

224
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,440
你不相信我?我不怪你
You don't trust me,do you? I don't blame you.

225
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,640
如果有新的世界
If there is to be a brave new world,-

226
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,810
我们的生活会十分艰难
- our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.

227
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,080
-洗朴 -总理，小姐
- Captain Spock. - Chancellor. Madam.

228
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,280
船长
Captain.

229
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,060
谢谢款待
Well,most kind.

230
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,790
分离真是甜蜜的悲痛
Parting is such sweet sorrow. Hmm,Captain?

231
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,630
听到午夜的报时钟吗？
“Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?”

232
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,930
谢天谢地
Thank God!

233
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,730
―看到他们的食相吗?―全无餐桌礼仪可言
- Did you see the way they ate? - Terrible table manners.

234
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,070
我们在外交史上一定很出众
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.

235
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,910
我要睡了，今晚真是一团糟
I'm going to sleep this off. Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?

236
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,920
我要喝咖啡
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.

237
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:55,130
高冈总理昨晚到企业号进晚餐
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.

238
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,870
我们的态度不太合礼节
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.

239
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,110
通知厨房：以后的外交场合不得端上麦芽酒
To the galley - Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.

240
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,220
却克，请到驾驶台找我
Captain Kirk,will you please join me on the bridge? Captain Kirk?

241
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,600
-船长 -有什么事？
- Captain. - What is it?

242
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,640
-我感到奇怪 -我很累
- I find this curious. - Spock,I'm really tired.

243
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,710
我们录得大量中子辐射
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.

244
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,010
―在哪里? -好像由我们发射
- Where? - It appears to emanate from us.

245
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,310
企业号？
The Enterprise?

246
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:43,950
韦利丽，你知道辐射激增吗？  查哥夫，你呢?
Val'eris,do you know anything about a radiation surge? Chekov?

247
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,850
只有我的头那么大
Only the size of my head.

248
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,430
我明白了
I know what you mean.

249
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,810
―发生什么事?―我们射中了总理的船
- What's happened? - We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.

250
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,250
发射室，我们有否发炮？
Torpedo room! Please confirm,have we fired?

251
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,980
乌娜，监测一下―知道
- Uhura,monitor. - Aye,sir.

252
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,720
-直接击中  -证实了
- Direct hit. - Confirmed,sir.

253
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,100
我们失去引力

254
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,290
我们被出卖了

255
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,480
这是驾驶台，收到吗？
This is the bridge. Do you read me?

256
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,150
―我们有否发炮?没有，炸弹没消耗
- Did we fire those torpedoes? - Negative. We're still fully loaded.

257
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,480
找张上将

258
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,260
无法确定有否发炮
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.

259
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,990
―打信号招呼―知道
- Hailing frequencies. - Aye,sir.

260
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,660
卡龙诺斯一号这是企业号，收到吗？
Kronos One,this is Enterprise. Do you read?

261
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,230
情况混乱，有枪声和尖叫声
It's very hard to make out. There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.

262
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,940
船倾斜了―它失控地转
- She's still listing. - She's spinning out of control.

263
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,800
恢复后备引力

264
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,750
你一点气量也没有
Have you not a shred of decency in you,Kirk?

265
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,820
你违背了我们的和约
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.

266
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,610
我要你在宇宙中消失
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.

267
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,200
―我们没有发炮 ―船长…
- We haven't fired. - Captain…

268
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,060
资料库显示我们发了两炮
According to our data banks, we have. Twice…

269
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,140
船长，他们来了
Captain,they're coming about.

270
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,810
―他们准备开火  -要开防护罩吗?
- They're preparing to fire. - Shields up,Captain?

271
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,510
-防护罩  -要开骂？
- Captain,our shields. - Shields up,Captain?

272
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,240
发投降信号
Signal our surrender.

273
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,890
我们投降！
We surrender!

274
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,720
―企业号宣布投降―若他们发炮，我们没防护罩
- This is Enterprise. We surrender. - If they fire,with our shields down…

275
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,300
―我们毫无还击之力―重复，企业号投降
…we will not be able to respond. - Repeat,Enterprise surrenders.

276
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,540
―我们有发炮吗？―我也想知道
- Are we firing torpedoes? - I wish I knew.

277
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,080
―我要上船，你在此控制―我该负责，让我去吧
- I'm going aboard. Spock,take the con. - I involved you,I will go.

278
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:39,520
我去，总不能在和谈前夕开战
No,I'll go. We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.

279
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,590
我也去，他们需要医生
I'm going too,they may need a doctor.

280
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,350
乌娜，通知他们我们要上船，没有带武器
Uhura,tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.

281
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,990
―你疯了吗?―我也不知发生什么事
- Have you lost your mind?! - I don't understand what's happened.

282
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,100
我们来帮忙的
We're here to help.

283
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,900
跟我来
Follow me.

284
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,130
―高冈总理―天，发生什么事?
- Chancellor Gorkon. - My God! What has happened here?

285
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,870
―你还装作无知？―他怎么了?
- You dare to feign ignorance? - What happened?

286
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,570
被直接击中你破坏我们的引力系统
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field -

287
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,770
你们派来的凶手穿了磁靴
- and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.

288
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,320
―你们有医生吗?―我们差不多全军覆没
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon? - We were until this disgrace.

289
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,960
让我为他急救
Then for God's sake,let me help.

290
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,430
他还有脉搏，来，搬他到桌上
I've got a pulse - we can move him. I need light. Put him on the table.

291
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,680
捉紧他，我要稳定他的情况
Hold him! Hold him while I stabilize him.

292
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,380
捉紧他
I said hold him!

293
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,860
天
Sweet Jesus.

294
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,160
―你行吗?―我不清楚他的构造
- Can you…? - I don't even know his anatomy.

295
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,210
―他的伤口不愈合―他想杀他!
- His wounds are not closing. - He's killing him!

296
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,540
他的身体机能停滞了
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.

297
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,780
醒醒，醒来！
Come on,dammit! Come on!

298
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,790
他没有反应
He's not responding.

299
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,490
不要就此结束
Don't let it end this way,Captain.

300
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,660
根据星际法例第184条
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law…

301
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,230
我要拘捕你
…I'm placing you under arrest.

302
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,930
你被控暗杀我们的总理
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.

303
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,130
他在抢救他
He tried to save him.

304
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,010
他们被捕了
They've been arrested.

305
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,050
冼朴，我们要想办法
Mr Spock,we've got to do something.

306
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,450
太空船自二点半开始由我指挥
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.

307
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:45,960
乌娜，通知总部，寻求对策
Commander Uhura,notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.

308
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,500
我们不能让他们进克林冈监狱
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.

309
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:55,130
开火无补于事，我们不能交战
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.

310
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,740
我们可追查船长的行踪
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.

311
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,110
-怎样追查？  -时间很宝贵
- How did you achieve this? - Time is precious.

312
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,680
我们要弄清今晚发生的事
We must piece together what happened here tonight.

313
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,550
资料库显示我们发了两次炮
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.

314
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,350
―没有可能―我同意，但我们需要证据
- No way! - I sympathize,but we need evidence.

315
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,650
跟我来
Please accompany me.

316
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,220
如果查不出问题所在呢？
And if we cannot piece together what happened? What then,sir?

317
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,860
那就要由外交官处理了
In that case,Mr Chekov,it resides in the purview of the diplomats.

318
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,710
总理死了！
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!

319
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,610
他受到突击
The result of an unprovoked attack -

320
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:40,880
当时他在执行和平任务途中
- while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!

321
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,420
却克船长依法被捕了
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.

322
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,720
他和麦盖医生登上了卡龙诺斯一号
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.

323
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,160
―这是不争的事实―我己下令调查
- None of these facts are in dispute. - I have ordered an investigation.

324
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,300
-同时…   -同时…
- In the meantime… - In the meantime…

325
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:05,000
我们希望星盟遵守星际法例
…we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.

326
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,100
却克和麦盖要为暗杀总理受审
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.

327
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,020
那当然   沙力，我们可引渡他们吗?
Out of the question. Ambassador Sarek,can we get them extradited?

328
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,630
我对此事有一定责任
Mr President,I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter,-

329
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,230
但我得确认他们的法律解释
- but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.

330
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,890
罗武伦政府持什么立场？
What is the position of the Romulan government?

331
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,700
我同意他们的意见
I must concur with my colleagues.

332
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:38,370
难道你相信却克会暗杀总理？
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.

333
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,070
主席，我不知应该信什么
Mr President. I don't know what to believe.

334
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,250
我在等你答覆
I'm waiting for your answer,sir.

335
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:52,690
我不能凌驾于法律之上
This President is not above the law.

336
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:59,130
企业号，请回应，收到吗?
This President is not above the law.

337
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,870
―我们要马上回应―我们不能离弃船长他们
- We're to report back at once. - We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.

338
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:10,540
四百年前工人觉得机器有威胁性
400 years ago,on Earth,workers who felt their livelihood threatened -

339
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,310
把凉鞋掉进机器弄停它
400 years ago,on Earth,workers who felt their livelihood threatened -

340
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,260
这就是英文捣乱一词的由来
Hence the word “sabotage”.

341
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,960
现在我们的后备系统坏了
We experience technical malfunction. All back-up systems inoperative.

342
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,570
太好了，不，真糟糕
Excellent. I mean… too bad.

343
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:40,840
我继任了父亲总理一职
Excellent. I mean… too bad.

344
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,280
总理小姐，请接受我的吊慰
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.

345
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,450
我保证那恶行不是…
I assure you that this shameful deed will not…

346
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,960
既然大家都想继续和谈
Let us come to the point. You want this conference to go forward.

347
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,530
我会在一周内出席，条件是…
I will attend in one week, on one condition.

348
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:05,200
我们不会引渡囚犯你不用营救他们
I will attend in one week, on one condition.

349
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,470
否则等于煽动战争
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.

350
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,740
我们希望你来地球作客
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.

351
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,980
经此一役，我决定保持中立
After recent events,you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.

352
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,520
为了安全，会面地点要保密
And in the interests of security,let us keep the location secret for now.

353
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,030
你作主吧
As you wish,Madam Chancellor.

354
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,560
趁我们有能力，快攻击他们
As you wish,Madam Chancellor.

355
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,600
否则会成为他们的奴隶

356
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,910
动武可以占领全球

357
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:47,340
战争不合时宜

358
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:52,820
我们身处险境

359
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:58,720
我宁死也不委曲求全

360
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,160
这不是我父亲的遗愿

361
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,890
你父亲是自愿给杀死的
Your father was killed for what he wanted.

362
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,260
和谈要继续
The peace process will go forward.

363
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,600
却克…
Kirk…

364
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,680
却克要为我父亲偿命
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

365
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,400
却克…

366
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,790
不知所谓的审讯
It's a damn show trial.

367
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,510
企业号突击卡龙诺斯一号
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.

368
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,540
总理及顾问
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.

369
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,440
当晚七点半获邀请
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.

370
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,210
到企业号用膳
- by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel -

371
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,580
因此放松了警惕
- at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.

372
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,280
传第一证人
- at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.

373
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,990
第一击后，我们失去了引力
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.

374
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,460
我失控地飘起来
I was weightless and couldn't function.

375
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,600
两名星际舰队队员走过来
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.

376
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,430
可能他们乔装成队员
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.

377
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,770
这只是猜测
That remark is speculative. I move that it be stricken.

378
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,970
我们想听事实而非理论
We're interested in facts,not theories.

379
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,920
没有引力，他们如何行走？
If the gravitational unit was not functioning,how could they walk?

380
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,450
他们穿了磁靴
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.

381
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,690
-引力靴？  ―麦盖医生
- Gravity boots…? - Dr. McCoy.

382
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,700
可否告诉我
- Gravity boots…? - Dr. McCoy.

383
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:10,890
你目前的健康状况？
- what is your current medical status?

384
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,840
除了动脉炎外，一切正常
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.

385
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,120
你真有幽默感
You have a singular wit,Doctor.

386
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,910
我为企业号服务了二十七年
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.

387
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,990
还有三个月就退休
In three months I stand down.

388
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,290
你知道吗?
You know…

389
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,560
我知道你当晚与众人…
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale -

390
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,170
喝了很多麦芽酒，对吗?
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale -

391
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,400
-反对  -反对有效
- Objection. - Sustained.

392
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,100
我们全都喝了，这不表示…
We all did. All of us. That doesn't mean…

393
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,980
你诊断高冈总理时他还生存吗?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?

394
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,550
他己奄奄一息
Barely.

395
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,550
你以前试过救活…
Barely.

396
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,990
与他一样垂危的病人吗？
Barely.

397
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,320
我不熟识克林冈人的构造
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.

398
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,800
―是吗?―你也在场
- I see. - You where there.

399
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:18,270
你快退休了，会手震吗？
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask,do your hands shake?

400
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,500
-反对！ -我很紧张
- Objection! - I was nervous.

401
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,810
不，是你无能
No. You were incompetent.

402
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,810
你无能！
You were incompetent!

403
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,180
蓄意谋杀还是年老加酒精影响
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.

404
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,190
―法庭会判决   ―天，我在救他！
- The court will have to determine. - My God,man. I tried to save him!

405
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,390
我尝试救他
I tried to save him.

406
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,930
我尽力救他
I was desperate to save him.

407
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,600
他是实现宇宙和平的最后希望
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.

408
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,610
证人可以退下
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.

409
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:05,650
我们己知道案情细节

410
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,550
现在要审讯这宗悲剧的主谋
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.

411
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,130
却克船长
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.

412

你最喜爱的作家会说什么?
What would your favourite author say, Captain?

413
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,300
[坐下诉说己故国王的故事]
What would your favourite author say, Captain?

414
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,810
说出你的故事吧
Tell us your sad story,Kirk.

415
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:35,040
说出你想怎样为子报仇
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.

416
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,310
-不是这样的  -反对
- That's not true. - Objection!

417
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,420
没有证据显示却克船长是刺客
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.

418
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:48,820
请听听船长这番话
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.

419
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,800
我从不信任克林冈人
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.

420
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,370
他们害死我儿子，不能原谅
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.

421
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,680
再放一次…

422
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,340
我从不信任克林冈人
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.

423
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,110
他们害死我儿子，不能原谅
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.

424
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,550
这是你的话吗？
Are those your words?

425
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,220
是我说的
Those words were spoken by me.

426
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,200
反对，政治立场与本案无关
Objection! My client's political views are not on trial.

427
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:38,210
他的政治立场正是关键问题
On the contrary. Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.

428
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:44,680
记录显示他是个不守纪律
His record shows him to be an insubordinate,unprincipled opportunist -

429
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:48,220
经常违抗命令的人
His record shows him to be an insubordinate,unprincipled opportunist -

430
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,750
继绩
Continue.

431
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,290
却克船长曾任上将
Continue.

432
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,400
因胡作非为被降职
- and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.

433
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,440
难道你敢否认吗?回答我！
Do you deny being demoted for these charges. Answer me now!

434
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,270
―我不能否认―你被降职?
- I cannot deny it. - You were demoted?

435
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,640
―因违抗命令?―我有时不守纪律
- For insubordination? - On occasion,I have disobeyed orders.

436
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,800
你策划暗杀高冈总理时
- For insubordination? - On occasion,I have disobeyed orders.

437
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,920
是奉命行事还是违抗命令?
- when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?

438
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,810
我上了船才知道他遇袭
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.

439
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:25,790
你仍然否认企业号向卡龙诺斯一号开火?
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?

440
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,230
你仍否认派人上船射杀总理?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?

441
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,090
我不能承认或否认不知情的事
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.

442
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:38,430
你身为太空船船长
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship,-

443
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,740
要为下属的行为负贵
- you are responsible for the actions of your men?

444
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,580
我知道
I am.

445
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:53,190
若你的下属证实策划暗杀
I am.

446
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,290
他们在诬陷你，别回答
- They're setting us up. Your Honours! - Do not answer.

447
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,950
却克船长必须回答
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.

448
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,360
身为船长…
As Captain…

449

我必须为下属的行为负贵
…I'm responsible for the crew under my command.

群情平静了
Your Honours,the state rests.

Send to Commander Enterprise.

It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.

454
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,710
本案证据并不充分
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.

455
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,680
恳请法庭判刑前考虑清楚
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.

I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.

- for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.

460
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:28,140
这是法庭的裁决
It is the judgement of this court -

461

没有缓刑，不能假释
- that,without possibility of reprieve or parole,-

462

你们要被放逐到劳改星球

Better to kill them now and get it over with.

Lieutenant. The torpedo hit once again,please.

Hold.

这是企业号，是我们发炮
It is Enterprise. We fired.

471

不可能，全部炮弹还在
That is not possible! All weapons visually accounted for,sir.

472

我的祖先说过
An ancestor of mine maintained -

473
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:00,410
减去不可能，剩下的就是真理
- that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.

474
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,770
什么意思?
What does that mean?

475
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,070
我们没有发炮，但其他人有
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes,someone else did.

476
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,220
他们不会向自己开火当时又无其他船
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.

477
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,220
―中子曾经激增  -不是我们发出的
- There was a neutron surge. - Not from us.

- Kronos One? - Too far away.

Very near us. Possibly beneath us.

如果下面有船，他们定会看见
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.

会吗？
Would they?

-猛禽号？  -猛禽号
- A Bird of Prey? - A Bird of Prey.

484
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:51,450
―隐了形?   ―隐形怎能开火
- Cloaked? - They can't fire when they're cloaked.

485
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,150
正常情况下是不可能
All things being equal,I would agree.

486
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:59,460
但此事很不寻常，或许有可能
However,things are not equal. This one can.

487
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,130
―我们要通知司令―通知什么?
- We must inform Starfleet Command. - Of what?

488
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:08,000

A new weapon that's invisible? They'll call us raving lunatics.

489
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,910
说我们为了救船长什么也敢说
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.

490
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,310
他们说得对，我们没有证据
And they would be correct. We have no evidence.

491
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,750
只有切合现实的理论
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.

492
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,820
他们为何要杀自己的总理?
Assuming you're right. Why would they fire on their own President?

493
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,890
真是
Indeed.

494
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,190
要彻底搜索这艘船
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.

495
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,560
我不明白，如果有船在下面
I do not understand. If there was a ship underneath us -

496
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:40,040
炮弹不会从这里发出
I do not understand. If there was a ship underneath us -

497
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,540
你忘了一件事
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.

498

资料库显示我们发了炮
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.

499
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,110
凶手应该在这里
If we did,the killers are here.

500
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,780
改动资料库的人也在这里
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.

501
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:59,620
我们要在此搜寻
In either case, what we are looking for is here.

502
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:04,350
―搜寻什么?―你认为呢?
In either case, what we are looking for is here.

503
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,160
两双引力靴
In either case, what we are looking for is here.

1
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,760
这里就是劳改星球鲁拉宾迪
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.

2
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:25,200
没有监狱、守卫塔、电子边界
There is no stockades,no guard tower,no electronic frontier.

3
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:29,810
只有磁力罩
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.

4
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:35,350
若有犯错，刑罚是逐上地面
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.

5
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:41,120
没有人能在地面生存
On the surface,nothing can survive.

6
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,320
做好点，待遇会好点
Work well,and you will be treated well.

7
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,270
做得不好，就会死
Work badly,and you will die.

8
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,950
天
Oh,my God!

9
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,470
我们没有翻译员
The universal translator has been confiscated.

10
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,700
什么？
I'm sorry…?

11
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:41,170
他有话想说
He's definitely on about something,Jim.

12
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,850
如果这是你的范围，我们会走
If this is your spot,we'll move on.

13
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,850
他要你服从外星人公会
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.

14
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,290
―没问题  -交出你的外套
- He's got it. - And your coat.

15
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,480
恐怕不称身
I'm afraid not. It wouldn't fit.

16
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,340
―谢谢―这有助你保暖
- Thanks. - This will help keep you warm.

17
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:23,640
―我是马蒂亚，我知你们是谁―你怎知道?
- I'm Martia. You're Kirk and McCoy. - How did you know that?

18
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,150
你们暗杀总理
We don't get many presidential assassins.

19
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,090
―我们没有杀高冈―当然没有
- We didn't kill Gorkon. - Of course not.

20
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,520
―但判你死刑有奖赏―有道理
- But there's a reward for your death. - That figures.

21
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,200
我们被诬陷
We've been set up.

22
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,660
有人不想你们碍事
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.

23
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,700
-有何进展？  -没有
- Any progress? - None.

24
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:54,210
有三百人展开搜索但凶手也可能在其中
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere,but the killers may still be among them.

25
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,820
磁靴肯定己丢掉了
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.

26
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,960
靴子会否留在高冈的船上
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?

27
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:06,320
他们离开时引力还未恢复
Logic must give way to physics. Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.

28
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,930
没有磁靴就会浮起
Without the boots,they would have floated off the transporter pads.

29
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,530
何不直接把它化掉?
Why not simply vaporize them?

30
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,510
这样？
Like this?

31
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:31,290
不能未经许可在船上开死光枪
As you know,no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.

32
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,820
可能他们回来时扔掉靴子
Suppose,when they returned,they threw the boots into the refuse.

33
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,590
我正搜寻垃圾堆
I'm having the refuse searched.

34
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,830
我猜凶手把靴挂在颈上
If I'm correct,those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.

35
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,900
他们不能不穿靴离去也不能抛出窗外
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.

36
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,040
靴子一定在这里某处
Those boots are here. Somewhere.

37
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:59,640
-有人开枪吗？  -没事
- Did someone fire off a phaser? - It's alright. It's nothing.

38
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:04,220
星际舰队催促我们回码头
Mr Spock,Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.

39
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,620
-谁发射…  -史葛
- Who fired the… - Ah,Mr Scott.

40
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:12,280
听说船索坏了，要修理多久?
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive. How long do you need for repair?

41
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,360
船索那有问题？
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.

42
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:21,800
若我们回去，凶手会丢掉靴子
If we return to space dock,the killers can dispose of their footwear -

43
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:26,030
我们无缘再见船长和麦盖了
- and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.

44
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,610
―需要几星期―谢谢
- It could take weeks. - Thank you.

45
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:32,840
通知舰队我们的船索失灵
Val'eris,inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.

46
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,020
-这是谎话？  -只是差错
- A lie? - An error.

47
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,990
我们跟船长和麦盖完全失去联络
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.

48
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,180
现在他们被磁罩包围
Yes,at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.

49
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:51,130
我猜船长一定在计划逃狱
But if I know the Captain,he is deep into planning his escape.

50
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,390
却克，你触怒了他
You've got him where you want him,Jim!

51
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:11,470
-你没事吧？  -没事
- Are you alright? - I think so.

52
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,810
―你现在受到尊重了―幸好那东西有膝盖
- They'll respect you now. - I was lucky that thing had knees.

53
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,450
那不是他的膝盖
That was not his knee.

54
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,760
每个人的生殖部位都不一样
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place,Captain.

55
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,480
你是说…
Anything you want to tell me?

56
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:31,430
快去解释我们无意冒犯
See what you can do for him. Let him know we're not holding a grudge.

57
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,470
他可能很生气
Suppose he's holding a grudge?

58
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:42,240
不论人们做什么，也不要多问
When whoever it is makes their move,you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

59
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:49,280
―你想逃出去吗?―一定有出路的
- Do you want to get out of here? - There's got to be a way.

60
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,440
退休前三个月就完蛋了
Three months before retirement. What a way to finish.

61
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:17,770
―我们还未完蛋―你自圆其说
- We're not finished. - Speak for yourself.

62
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:21,540
迟早会完的
One day,one night… Kobayashi Maru!

63
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:27,210
你害怕将来吗？
Bones! Are you afraid of the future?

64
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:32,190
这正是我一直想说的事
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.

65
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:37,860
―我不是指这个将来―是什么?选择题?
- I don't mean this future. - What is this - multiple choice?

66
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:43,490
有些人害怕将会发生的事
Some people are afraid… of what might happen.

67
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,810
-我很怕  -你怕什么？
- I was terrified. - What terrified you,specifically?

68
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,480
再没有中立区
No more Neutral Zone.

69
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,190
我一向憎恨克林冈人
I was used to hating Klingons.

70
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,260
我从不信高冈所言
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.

71
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,900
―冼朴对了   -别自贵，我们同样难受
- Spock was right. - We all felt exactly the same.

72
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:23,170
不，有人难受得多
No. Somebody felt a lot worse.

73
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,910
我开始明白了
I'm beginning to understand why.

74
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,520
若你没有好主意现在是时候…
If you've got any bright ideas,now is the time.

75
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,250
时间是问题，我们帮不上忙
Time is the problem. You and I are nothing.

76
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,860
你听到吗?和谈恢复了
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.

77
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:43,230
杀高冈的凶手会再进行暗杀
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.

78
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,970
除非我们逃离这里
Unless we can get out of here.

79
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:04,950
是我，没有人曾成功逃狱
It's me - Martia. Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.

80
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,520
-除了我们   -有可能的
- Except us. - It is possible.

81
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:10,890
我知道如何逃出罩外
I know how to get outside the shield.

82
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,890
―我们要怎样做?―出去其实很容易
- How do we fit in? - Getting outside the shield is easy.

83
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,470
但要在冻僵前逃出生天
After that,you have to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?

84
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,400
―没问题―我需要你帮忙
- It's possible. - I can't make it alone.

85
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:29,310
你是最有潜质的候选人
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.

86
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,140
什么候选人？
Candidate for what?

87
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:51,060
早上采矿时在7号电梯见
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty. I'll see you there.

88
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,930
别令我失望
Don't disappoint me.

89
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,470
―你怎么了?―还认为我们会完蛋吗
- What is it with you,anyway? - Still think we're finished?

90
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,700
从未如此担心过
More than ever.

91
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,380
吵醒你真对不起
Sorry to wake you,sir.

92
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:14,350
星际舰队想知道企业号的位置
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.

93
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:17,730
什么？
What?

94
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:22,300
他们拒绝确认回码头的信号
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock,sir.

95
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:31,270
回覆说我们不知企业号的位置
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.

96
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,900
―船长?―你听觉有问题吗?
- Sir? - You have hearing problems?

97
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,270
没有
No,sir.

98
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,720
克林冈人的血
Klingon blood.

99
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:28,890
肯定是他们把血迹踩了进来
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.

100
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,230
这是我们的第一证据
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.

101
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,560
要通知星际舰队吗?
Now we go to Starfleet?

102
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,230
现在连制服也要搜查
We expand our search to include uniforms.

103
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,880
所有制服?
All uniforms?

104
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,590
这里没有
Clear,sir. Make a hole.

105
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,460
请让开
Coming through. Coming through.

106
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,970
船长…
Sir! Sir!

107
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,680
―她欺骗我们―你没有被骗
- I think we've been had. - No,you weren't,Doctor.

108
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:58,790
在第一层离去，跟大队到矿场
Get off at the first level. Follow the gang into the mine.

109
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,510
他们不载女孩
They don't take girls.

110
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:17,400
―你是迪斯?―对，什么事
- You are crewman Dax? - Yes. What is the problem?

111
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:23,100
听过灰姑娘的故事吗？
Perhaps you know the Russian epic of Cinderella?

112
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,480
试试是否合穿
If shoe fits - wear it.

113
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,150
查哥夫…
Mr Chekov…

114
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,970
看我的
Watch me.

115
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:55,640
―这是什么生物?昨晚你们…―别提了
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were…

116
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,070
进来
Get in.

117
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,350
快，我们时间无多
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.

118
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,870
快点
Hurry!

119
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,570
上面
Up there.

120
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,220
来，爬上来
Come on - climb!

121
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,860
穿上这些，快！
Here,you'll need these. Quickly!

122
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,410
跟我来
Stay close.

123
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,670
―他们在这里―他们快逃出来了
- There they are. - They emerge from the beaming shield.

124
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:44,430
史葛，开动引擎查哥夫，驶往鲁拉宾迪
Mr Scott,start your engines. Mr Chekov,set course for Rura Penthe.

125
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,630
鲁拉宾迪在克林冈边境内深处
Mr Spock,Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.

126
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,310
-若我们发现…   -对
- If we're discovered… - Correct.

127
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,920
在船长和麦盖冻死前
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity -

128
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,810
我们要运用掩眼法和勇气
- before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.

129
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,890
别理我，我完了―不会的
- Leave me,I'm finished. - No!

130
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:14,200
我身上有追踪器
Bones,I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.

131
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,430
冼朴在我们上船前贴上
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.

132
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,230
这个狡猾的维冈人
That cunning little Vulcan.

133
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,570
来，我们安全了
Come on! We're in the clear.

134
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:30,280
我们在罩外他们可追踪到我们
Now that we're outside the shield,they can locate us two sectors away.

135
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:32,510
如果他们在找我们的话
If they're even looking for us.

136
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,980
这是莫斯卡短波电台

137
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:08,510
这是什么船？

138
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:24,130
我们要回应，需要翻译
We must respond. A universal translator would be recognised.

139
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,410
我们是你的货船厄斯华

140
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,280
离开了卡龙诺斯

141
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,450
六星期

142
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,110
你们往什么目的地？
“What is your destination,over?”

143
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,840
我们有食物

144
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,720
物资供应

145
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:21,130
别捉虫子

146
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,790
可否解释一下你的把戏?
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?

147
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,830
―我是金密莱人―我听过这名字
- I'm a Chameloid. - I've heard about you.

148
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,340
变形人，真神奇
Shape-shifters. I thought you were mythical.

149
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:08,170
船长，给女孩一个机会
Give a girl a chance,Captain.

150
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:12,400
很费劲的
It takes a lot of effort.

151
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:15,010
我同意
I don't doubt it.

152
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,810
如果我错了，请告诉我
Stop me if I'm wrong,-

153
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:21,620
那一个才是真正的你？
- but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?

154
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:25,850
我采用了吸引人的形象
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.

155
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:36,360
我们己逃脱，到你了
We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn,Captain.

156
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,300
这个…
If you say so.

157
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,470
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?!

158
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,870
她不需我们帮助你的便服从何来的？
She didn't need our help. Where did you get these convenient clothes?

159
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:48,240
那火光不是监中物件
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.

160
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:52,150
她在通风报信，换取报酬
It's to let them know where we are. Ask her what she's getting in return.

161
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,920
你竟然这样对我
A full pardon… which doesn't cover this.

162
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:00,190
这不可能是意外
An accident wasn't good enough. Come on,Spock.

163
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:05,160
―次意外没有问题  两次会惹人怀疑
Good enough for one. Two would have looked suspicious.

164
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:10,740
逃亡时被杀，双方也可信
Killed while attempting escape. That's convincing for both.

165
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,300
意外吧
Surprise!

166
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,350
―你的朋友来迟了―他们正赶来
- Your friends are late. - They'll be along.

167
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:37,890
―我竟然吻过你―你一定期待己久
- I can't believe I kissed you. - Must have been your lifelong ambition.

168
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,510
你是时候改变形象了
Isn't it time you became something else?

169
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,410
我喜欢这个形象
I like it here.

170
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:10,930
好了…
Well,well,well…

171
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:21,140
你为何来得这么晚？
What took you so long?

172
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:23,800
杀了他，他才是真身
Kill him,he's the one.

173
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,910
不是我，是他！
Not me,you idiot - him!

174
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,850
-没有证人  -逃亡时被杀
- No witnesses. - Killed while trying to escape.

175
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,610
-真聪明  -这是经典
- Damned clever,if you ask me. - It's a classic.

176
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,750
―这是他们的意思―谁?谁想杀我们?
- That's what he wanted. - Who? Who wanted us killed?

177
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:44,130
反正你要死，告诉你又何妨
Since you're all going to die anyway,why not tell you?

178
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,320
他是…
His name is…

179
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:58,800
真讨厌…你为何不多等两秒?
Damn it! What the hell! Son of a…! Couldn't you have waited two seconds?

180
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,980
他正交代事情始末
He was about to explain the whole thing.

181
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,880
-你想回去？  -绝对不
- You want to go back? - Absolutely not!

182
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,210
这是驾驶台   我们仍在克林冈领空
This is the bridge. We're still in Klingon space.

183
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:15,990
9号甲板，维持战斗岗位
Deck 9,remain at battle stations. Deck 9,remain at battle stations.

184
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,560
他们被接回星盟太空船

185
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:53,720
我可以追踪…

186
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:02,110
逃脱

187
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:08,000
却克不知道和谈的场地

188
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,710
你肯定?

189
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:15,290
你愿意冒险吗？

190
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,390
舵手，快去拦截企业号

191
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,830
克林冈人有艘猛禽号可以隐形发炮
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.

192
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,200
―它向高冈的船发炮―就是它
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship. - So that's it.

193
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:36,740
凶手就在这艘船上
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.

194
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,140
―和谈开始了没有?―不知道，地点保密
- Has the peace conference begun? - Who knows? The location is secret.

195
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,340
―一定有事  -船长，冼朴！
- There's always something. - Captain! Mr Spock!

196
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:46,920
我发现染有克林冈人血迹的制服
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.

197
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:07,970
制服属于这两个人卜奇和沉努
But the uniforms belong to these two men. Burke and Samno.

198
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:12,240
有人近距离向他们开枪
Not anymore. Phaser on “stun” at close range.

199
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:16,080
暗杀规例第一条：杀死刺客
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.

200
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,240
―我们退回起点了―我想和你谈谈
- Now we're back to square one. - Can I talk to you?

201
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,790
―他们为何没有化掉―会惊动警钟
- Why weren't they vaporized? - It would set off the alarm.

202
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,140
这也可行
It's possible.

203
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:41,170
请注意…
Now hear this. Now hear this.

204
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:45,510
速记员请到病房，蓝色急事
Court reporter to sick bay. Code blue - urgent.

205
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:49,550
急需录取卜奇和沉努的口供
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.

206
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:54,120
速记员请到病房，蓝色急事
Repeat,court reporter to sick bay. Code blue - urgent.

207
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,520
要录取口供
Statements to be taken.

208
01:21:56,690 --> 01:22:01,820
录取卜奇和沉努的口供
Repeat,statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.

209
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,490
你应该开枪
You have to shoot.

210
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:49,780
你有逻辑的话，就应该开枪
If you are logical,you have to shoot.

211
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,950
―我不想的―你的目的毫无意义
- I do not want to. - What you want is irrelevant.

212
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,280
你的选择已经得到
What you've chosen is at hand.

213
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,250
我不希望是你
I'd just as soon you didn't.

214
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,520
手术完了
The operation is over.

215
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:21,530
我没有发炮，你没有证据
I did not fire. You cannot prove anything.

216
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:26,840
审讯时，我的日志成为证物
Yes,I can. At my trial my personal log was used against me.

217
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:31,080
你一直在我房外探听
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?

218
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,450
你知道?
You knew?

219
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:39,060
我想告诉你，但你不听
You knew?

220
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:43,290
当晚没有人留心听
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.

221
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,990
我曾叫你要有信心
There were things I tried to tell you,about having faith.

222
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:52,040
你们全部也背叛了星盟
You have betrayed the Federation. All of you.

223
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:55,540
―你认为自己在做什么―拯救星际舰队
- And what have you've been doing? - Saving Starfleet.

224
01:23:55,740 --> 01:24:02,580
克林冈人不可靠船长，你说过的
Klingons cannot be trusted. Sir… You said so yourself.

225
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:06,780
他们杀了你的儿子你不想高冈死吗?
They killed your son. Did you not wish Gorkon dead?

226
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:11,580
你说过；让他们自生自灭-
“Let them die”,you said. Did I misinterpret you?

227
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,420
你说对了
And you were right.

228
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,620
他们与我们串通暗杀自己的总理
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.

229
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,170
他们怎会可信？
How trustworthy can they be?

230
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:26,140
克林冈人与星盟成员串通
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.

231
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:30,640
―谁是[我们]?  ―不爱和平的人
- Who is “us”? - All who stands to lose from peace.

232
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,400
说出他们的名字
Names,Lieutenant.

233
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:38,050
我的同党会干扰你们的通讯
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.

234
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:43,660
―说出他们的名字―我记不起
- Names,Lieutenant! - I do not remember.

235
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,760
这是谎话?
A lie?

236
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:51,090
只是选择
A choice.

237
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,400
冼朴
Spock.

238
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:44,470
卡上将
Admiral Cartwright.

239
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:47,210
来自星际舰队？
From Starfleet?

240
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,820
还有谁?
Who else?

241
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:04,430
张上将
General… Chang.

242
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:18,180
―还有呢?―罗武伦大使及其他人
- Who else? - Romulan Ambassador and others.

243
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:24,550
和谈在哪里举行？
Where is the peace conference?

244
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,900
和谈在哪里举行？
Where is the peace conference?

245
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,130
她不知道
She does not know.

246
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:08,130
那我们死了
Then we're dead.

247
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:23,870
我己死过一次，联络上进号
I have been dead before. Contact Excelsior.

248
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:28,180
―他们会提供合作―我己联络了他
- She'll have the co-ordinates. - I've already got it,sir.

249
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,290
―却克船长，准备―苏路
- Standing by,Captain Kirk. - Sulu.

250
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:36,050
你知否我们通话是违反规条?
You realize that by even talking to us,you're violating regulations.

251
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:38,960
对不起，我听不清楚
I'm sorry,Captain. Your message is breaking up.

252
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:42,900
和谈在哪里举行？
Bless you,Sulu. Where is the peace conference?

253
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,660
他们会发动第二次暗杀
They'll attempt another assassination.

254
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,870
杰图马营，罗武伦边境附近
It's at Camp Khitomer,near the Romulan border.

255
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,770
我会用密码信号发给你
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.

256
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,280
恐怕这还不够
We'll need more than that.

257
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:59,350
我们被猛禽号监视它可以隐形发炮
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire while cloaked.

258
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,890
不是吧
Surely not.

259
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:06,820
有多少人在那里?
How many of those things are there? Come on,Lieutenant.

260
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,960
-只有样本  -你听到吗？
- Just the prototype. - Do you hear that?

261
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:13,690
我现在起航，但我们郧脍一区
I'm getting under way now. We're in Alpha Quadrant.

262
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,860
恐怕赶不及到会场
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.

263
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:22,030
―会议何时开始?―我收到的资料是今天
- When does this conference start? - According to my information - today.

264
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:27,000
―谢谢你   -别客气
- Thank you,Captain Sulu. - Don't mention it,Captain Kirk.

265
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:36,020
冼朴？
Spock?

266
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,420
不要开灯
I prefer it dark.

267
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:49,690
―你在忏悔?   -对
- Dining on ashes? - You were right.

268
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:56,900
都怪我自视过高
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.

269
01:28:57,110 --> 01:29:00,550
你和麦盖差点没命
You and the Doctor might have been killed.

270
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:03,210
我们经验不够
The night is young.

271
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:08,150
你说为了和平，值得犯险
You said it yourself,it was logical. Peace is worth a few personal risks.

272
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,960
你有逻辑头脑
You're a great one for logic.

273
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:19,160
我则好管闲事
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.

274
01:29:19,330 --> 01:29:25,970
我们太激进，该学习中庸之道
We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between.

275
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:32,540
我不能忘掉丧子之痛
I couldn't get past the death of my son.

276
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:37,480
她的出色表现令我偏爱
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.

277
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:41,420
高冈死了我才知道自己十分偏激
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.

278
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:51,530
是不是…
Is it possible…

279
01:29:52,270 --> 01:30:00,070
我们又老又不灵活
…that we two,you and I,have grown so old and inflexible -

280
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:04,770
什么也做不来了?
- that we have outlived our usefulness?

281
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,950
这是不是笑话？
Would that constitute a joke?

282
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:13,650
―这不是你的错―我有责任
- It wasn't your fault. - I was responsible.

283
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,820
只需为自己的行为负责―你在庭上不是这样说
- For no actions but your own. - That's not what you said at your trial.

284
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:22,290
身为船长，作为人…
That was as captain of the ship. Human beings…

285
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,860
你该知道我不是人
We both know that I am not human.

286
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:29,700
你知道吗?众生也是人
Do you want to know something? Everybody's human.

287
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:34,430
我觉得这句话很侮辱
I find that remark… insulting.

288
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:36,300
来，我需要你
Come,I need you.

289
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,550
总理小姐，各位外交人员
Madam Chancellor,members of the diplomatic corps…

290
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:49,550
各位来宾
…honoured guests.

291
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:53,090
星盟欢迎你们来到杰图马营
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.

292
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:12,700
猛禽号一定在附近
She's out here somewhere.

293
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:17,820
―如果它隐了形―唯有看辐射读数
- But if she's cloaked… - Then all we have is a radiation surge.

294
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:22,510
我们录得辐射时，已经炸死了
By the time we're close enough to record it,we're ashes.

295
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:27,790
2.06
2.06…

296
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:33,130
2.03
2.03…

297
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:38,760
―可以起程了吗?―还有两分钟，1．58
- Close enough to beam down? - Not yet. In two minutes. 1.58.

298
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,270
全速驶往杰图马营
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.

299
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:57,220
我们有能力做一件事
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing -

300
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:02,290
不代表我们一定要去做
- it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.

301
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,300
-邬娜？  -没有异像
- Uhura? - Nothing,Captain.

302
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:11,600
猛禽号可能正在无声航行
If she's here,she's rigged for silent running.

303
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:22,280
还有57秒到达运送器范围
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.

304
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,970
运送器房，准备
Transporter room. Stand by to beam down.

305
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:30,480
53秒
53…

306
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:36,690
48秒
48 seconds.

307
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:43,430
44秒
44…

308
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,800
却克，我看到你了
I can see you,Kirk.

309
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,000
张上将
I can see you,Kirk.

310
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:53,680
你看到我吗？
Can you see me?

311
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:58,650
老实说，战士对战士
Now be honest,Captain. Warrior to warrior.

312
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:02,780
你喜欢这样的，是吗？
You do prefer it this way,don't you? As it was meant to be.

313
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,290
我们这里没有和平
No peace in our time.

314
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:11,730
好朋友，进攻又开始了
“Once more unto the breach,dear friends.”

315
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:30,410
―真有趣   -回动引擎，退后
- This is fun. - Reverse engines. All astern.

316
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,810
以1．5冲力退后
One and a half impulse power. Back off!

317
01:33:36,990 --> 01:33:39,860
它做什么？

318
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,190
它在等什么？
What's she waiting for?

319
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,160
可能想知道我们为何退后
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.

320
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,570
看我们是否侦察到它
Wondering whether we detect her.

321
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:56,540
来了
Incoming!

322
01:34:00,650 --> 01:34:03,080
-相通了吗? ―还未
- In range? - Not yet,sir.

323
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:04,740
快点
Come on!

324
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:06,850
―它会爆炸的―那就炸掉它
- She'll fly apart. - Fly her apart,then!

325
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:12,690
很多人也怀疑我父亲的动机
Many speculated about my father's motives.

326
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:18,060
有人说他是空想家有人说他没有选择
Some said he was an idealist. Others said he had no choice.

327
01:34:18,230 --> 01:34:23,830
如果普拉西斯不爆炸他不会有此空想
If Praxis had not exploded,his idealism wouldn't have found expression.

328
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:27,440
我们以自己的民族为荣
We are a proud race.

329
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:32,340
我们想继续感到自豪
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.

330
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:46,990
―启动后备电力―后备电路受到破坏
- Go to auxiliary power! - Auxiliary circuits destroyed.

331
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:56,430
痒了可以不笑吗?刺伤了可以不流血吗
“Tickle us,do we not laugh? Prick us,do we not bleed?”

332
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,630
遭到欺负可以不报复吗？
“Wrong us,shall we not revenge?”

333
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:03,300
气
Gas.

334
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:09,880
船在冲力下要加气
Gas,Captain. Under impulse power she expands fuel,like all vessels.

335
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:15,580
要离子气
We call it “plasma”,but it is merely ionised gas.

336
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,660
记录气体反常的设备呢？
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

337
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:24,960
那一定有排气管
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.

338
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:29,500
医生，可否为飞弹做手术?
Doctor,would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?

339
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:30,930
好
Fascinating.

340
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:35,600
转右
Hard to starboard.

341
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:41,040
我们建议在地球时间五十年内
The proposed agenda is as follows: The evacuation of Kronos -

342
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,680
撤走我们的居民
- has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.

343
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:47,510
第一阶段：准备撤走…
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation…

344
01:35:57,630 --> 01:36:03,000
我们受到猛击，防护罩受损
Captain,she's packing quite a wallop. Shields weakening.

345
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:14,610
开防护罩，等待他们进攻
Shields up! Alright,now we're giving them something else to shoot at.

346
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:24,120
游戏还未结束
The game's afoot.

347
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,270
--上进号被击中了―游戏结束了
- Excelsior's been hit! - “Our revels now are ended”,Kirk.

348
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:50,210
大混乱，我要发动战争
“Cry havoc,and let slip the dogs of war.”

349
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:54,350
―我的飞弹呢―不用操心
- Bones,where's my torpedo? - Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.

350
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,590
防护罩塌下了
Shields collapsing!

351
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:02,890
拿钥匙来，时间无多
The key,please. Time is short.

352
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:14,070
--船身被击中   -不知损毁隋况如何？
- The hull has been compromised. - I wonder how bad.

353
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,830
接上回波棒
Connect echo-bars.

354
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:18,410
讨论第二阶段的报告
…discuss the report on phase 2.

355
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:22,070
-更改A电路   -探测器
- Alter circuit A. - Sensor.

356
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,910
开始看计划的议程
…we commence within minutes of the preparation.

357
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:29,820
―我像北极星般不败―他闭嘴的话，我给他钱
- “I am constant as the Northern star.” - I'd give real money,if he'd shut up.

358
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:31,820
拿板来
Plate,please.

359
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:33,650
同化要花费…
…and assimilation will consume…

360
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:35,890
有反应了
We've got a heart beat.

361
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,960
克林冈帝国…
…with the Klingon Empire…

362
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:40,900
钥匙
Key,please.

363
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:43,400
―飞弹呢?―准备好了
- Where's that torpedo? - She's ready.

364
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:45,800
准备发射
Lock and load!

365
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:49,040
发射
Fire!

366
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:03,760
[做还是…]
“To be… or not”…

367
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,990
[不做]
…“to be.”

368
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,350
瞄准它开火
Target that explosion and fire.

369
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:14,790
发射
Fire!

370
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:28,210
这项工作需时一星期
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.

371
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:29,970
希望代表团
I hope that the delegation -

372
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:37,280
下月前履行第一阶段的规定
- can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.

373
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:41,330
时间是关键
As you know,time is of the essence.

374
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:43,120
让开！
Out of the way!

375
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:50,130
主席
Mr President!

376
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:53,130
主席
Mr President!

377
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:56,840
我是企业号的却克
Kirk,Enterprise.

378
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:00,370
保护总理

379
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:10,980
―拘捕他们―拘捕你自己-
- Arrest those men! - Arrest yourself!

380
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:17,390
她己彻底招供
We've got a full confession.

381
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:36,380
―这不是克林冈人的血―卡上将，别逃
- This is not Klingon blood. - Cartwright. Just a minute.

382
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,990
什么事?这是怎么一回事?
What's happened? What's the mean of all of this?

383
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:43,190
有关未来的事
It's about the future,Madam Chancellor.

384
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:49,670
有人认为未来代表历史的终结
Some people think the future means the end of history.

385
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:52,470
但历史还未完结
We haven't run out of history quite yet.

386
01:39:53,950 --> 01:39:57,210
你的父亲称未来为…
Your father called the future…

387
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:01,180
[尚未发现的地方]
…“the undiscovered country”.

388
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:06,280
人人都害怕转变
People can be very frightened of change.

389
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:13,730
你重建了我父亲的信心
You've restored my father's faith.

390
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:18,000
你重建了我儿子的信心
And you've restored my son's.

391
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:08,680
我们再一次挽救了文明
Once again,we've saved civilization as we know it.

392
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,520
幸好他们不起诉我们
And they're not going to prosecute.

393
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:15,150
我或会像韦利丽一样遭起诉
They could have prosecuted me. I felt like Val'eris.

394
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:18,200
不会的
They don't arrest people for having feelings.

395
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:24,740
真好，否则我们会有麻烦
And it's a good thing,too. If they did,we'd all have to turn ourselves in.

396
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:29,070
-切克船长   -苏路船长
- Captain Kirk. - Captain Sulu.

397
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:33,140
我代表所有船员向你致谢
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,I owe you my thanks.

398
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:39,620
很高兴再次与你合作，保重
Nice to see you in action one more time,Captain Kirk. Take care.

399
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:56,230
―天，真是艘大船  ―但也不及船长伟大
- My God,that's a big ship. - Not so big as her captain.

400
01:41:56,370 --> 01:42:00,140
这是再见了？
So… This is goodbye?

401
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:04,270
我们是时候各自启航
It's about time we got underway ourselves.

402
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,540
星际舰队有令
Captain,I have orders from Starfleet Command.

403
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:13,280
马上返回太空码头，解散队伍
We're to put back to space dock immediately… to be decommissioned.

404
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:33,160
如果我是人，我的反应会是…
If I were human,I believe my response would be:

405
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,330
[去死吧]
“Go to hell.”

406
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,510
如果我是人的话
If I were human.

407
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:46,310
要驶向哪里?
Course heading,Captain?

408
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:55,590
右面第二个星球
Second star to the right.

409
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,860
--直驶至明早
And straight on 'til morning.

410
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,250
掏吕长日志，星历9529.1
Captain's log,stardate 9529.1.

411
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:24,650
这是企业号最后一次在我指挥下航行
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.

412
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:26,850
这艘船和它的历史
This ship,and her history -

413
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:29,960
很快会由另一队伍接管
- will shortly become the care of another crew.

414
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:34,030
我们把未来交给后世的人们
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.

415
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,600
他们会继续我们的旅程
They'll continue the voyages we have begun -

416
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:39,170
探索所有尚未到过的地方
- and journey to all the undiscovered countries -

417
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:44,370
勇敢地到没有人…
- boldly going where no man,where no one…

418
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:47,070
到过的地方
…has gone before.
