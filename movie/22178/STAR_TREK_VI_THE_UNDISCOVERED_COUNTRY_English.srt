1
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,342
Stardate 9521.6.


2
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,554
Captain’s Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.


3
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,598
Hikaru Sulu commanding.


4
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,641
After three years,


5
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,061
I've concluded my first assignment
as master of this vessel,


6
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,982
cataloguing gaseous planetary
anomalies in Beta Quadrant.


7
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,195
We're heading home
under full impulse power.


8
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,240
I am pleased to report
that ship and crew have functioned well.


9
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,494
According to this, we've completed
our survey of the entire sector.


10
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,092
I have an energy wave
at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.


11
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,344
Visual.


12
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,806
My God.


13
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,228
Shields. Shields!


14
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,366
She's not answering her helm.


15
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,618
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.


16
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,744
Aye.


17
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,124
Quarter impulse power.


18
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,134
Damage report.


19
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,427
Checking all systems, Captain.


20
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,811
Don't tell me
that was any meteor shower.


21
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,104
Negative, sir.


22
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,942
The subspace shockwave
originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.


23
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,402
L ocation...


24
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,405
It's Praxis, sir. It's a Klingon moon.


25
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,741
Praxis is their key
energy production facility.


26
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,371
Send to Klingon High Command.


27
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,290
"This is Excelsior,
a Federation starship.


28
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,003
"We have monitored
a large explosion in your sector.


29
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,255
"Do you require assistance?”


30
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,174
-Aye, sir.
-Mr Valtane, any more data?


31
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,969
Yes, sir. I've confirmed
the location of Praxis, but...


32
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,262
What is it?


33
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,348
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.


34
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,725
Onscreen.


35
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,185
Magnify.


36
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,812
Computer enhancement.


37
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,359
-Praxis?
-What's left of it, sir.


38
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,862
Captain,
I'm getting a message from Praxis.


39
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,447
I et's have it.


40
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,297
This is Brigadier Kerla
speaking for the High Command.


41
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,925
There has been an incident on Praxis.


42
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:29,473
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.


43
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:35,562
Obey treaty stipulations
and remain outside the neutral zone.


44
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,857
This transmission ends nhow.


45
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,736
"An incident"?


46
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,947
-Do we report this, sir?
-Are you kidding?


47
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,207
What are we doing here?


48
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,250
Maybe they're throwing us
a retirement party.


49
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,420
-That suits me. I just bought a boat.
-This had better be good.


50
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,381
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar
at the Academy.


51
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,926
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?


52
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,594
If we're all here, where's Sulu?


53
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,139
Captain Sulu. On assignment.
Where's Spock?


54
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,486
This briefing Is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.


55
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,202
As you were.


56
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,583
To break this information down
succinctly,


57
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,379
the Klingon Empire
has roughly 50 years of life left to it.


58
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,299
For full details,
I'm turning this briefing over


59
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,760
to the Federation's special envoy.


60
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,816
Good morning.


61
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,653
Two months ago, a Federation starship
monitored an explosion


62
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,822
on the Klingon moon Praxis.


63
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,616
We believe it was caused
by over-mining


64
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,494
and insufficient safety precautions.


65
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:18,582
The moon's decimation means
the deadly pollution of their ozone.


66
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,792
They will have depleted
their supply of oxygen


67
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,461
In approximately 50 Earth years.


68
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,673
Due to their enormous military budget,


69
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,675
the Klingon economy does not have
the resources


70
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,428
with which to combat this catastrophe.


71
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,349
Last month, at the behest
of the Vulcan ambassador,


72
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:41,813
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.


73
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,984
He proposes to commence negotiations
at once.


74
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,361
Negotiations for what?


75
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,366
The dismantling of our space stations
and starbases along the neutral zone,


76
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,703
an end to almost 70 years
of unremitting hostility,


77
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,831
which the Klingons can no longer afford.


78
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,002
Bill, are we talking
about mothballing the Starfleet?


79
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,464
Well, I'm sure that our exploration
and scientific programmes


80
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,800
-would be unaffected, Captain, but...
-l must protest.


81
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:15,222
To offer Klingons safe haven
within Federation space is suicide.


82
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,558
Klingons would become
the alien trash of the galaxy,


83
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,268
and if we dismantle the fleet,


84
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,979
we'd be defenceless
before an aggressive species


85
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,065
with a foothold on our territory.


86
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,568
The opportunity here
is to bring them to their knees.


87
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,490
Then we'll be in a far better position
to dictate terms.


88
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,283
Sir?


89
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,702
Captain Kirk.


90
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,538
The Klingons
have never been trustworthy.


91
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,917
I'm forced to agree
with Admiral Cartwright.


92
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,002
This is a terrifying idea.


93
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:50,340
It is imperative that we act now
to support the Gorkon initiative


94
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,468
lest more conservative elements
persuade his empire


95
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,639
that it is better to attempt
a military solution and die fighting.


96
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,142
You, Captain Kirk,
are to be our first olive branch.


97
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,230
We have volunteered to rendezvous
with the Klingon vessel


98
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,607
which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon
to Earth


99
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,069
and to escort him safely
through Federation space.


100
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,153
Me?


101
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,490
Well, there are Klingons who feel
the same way about the peace treaty


102
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,076
as yourself and Admiral Cartwright,


103
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,747
but they'll think twice about attacking
the Enterprise under your command.


104
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,501
I have personally vouched for you
in this matter, Captain.


105
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,046
You have personally vouched?


106
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,760
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon
full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.


107
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,721
But a full ambassador
would be better equipped...


108
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,056
If there's no further business,


109
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,602
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.


110
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,397
I remind you, this meeting is classified.


111
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,240
I don't know whether
to congratulate you or not, Jim.


112
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,909
I wouldn't.


113
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,498
We volunteered?


114
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:11,463
There is an old Vulcan proverb,
"Only Nixon could go to China."


115
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,382
How could you vouch for me?


116
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,927
That's arrogant presumption.


117
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,180
My father requested
that I open negotiations...


118
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,141
I know your father's the Vulcan
ambassador, for heaven's sake,


119
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,685
but you know how I feel about this.


120
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,396
They're animals.


121
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,776
Jim, there Is an historic opportunity
here.


122
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,528
Don't believe them. Don't trust them.


123
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,615
-They are dying.
-Let them die.


124
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:47,207
Has it occurred to you that this crew
IS due to stand down in three months?


125
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,210
We've done our bit for king and country.


126
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,921
You should have trusted me.


127
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,889
Control, this is SD-103,
approach to spacedock. Over.


128
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,559
SD-103, you are clear
to deliver Captain Kirk and party


129
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,313
to NCC-1701 Alpha. Over.


130
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,028
Captain on the Bridge.


131
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,198
-As you were, Lieutenant...
-Valeris, sir.


132
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,410
We were told that you needed
a helmsman, so I volunteered.


133
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,663
Lieutenant, it is agreeable
to see you again.


134
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,749
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan
to be graduated


135
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,670
-at the top of her class at the academy.
-You must be very proud.


136
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,255
I don't believe so, sir.


137
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,382
She's a Vulcan, all right.


138
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,343
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.


139
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,595
-Scotty.
-Aye, Sir?


140
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,930
Did you find the engine room?


141
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,432
Right where I left it, sir.


142
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,476
Standby. Uhura, get me the dockmaster.


143
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,770
Control tower reading, sir.


144
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:55,233
Control, this is Enterprise
requesting permission to depart.


145
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,862
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.


146
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,530
Thirty seconds for port gates.


147
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,240
Clear all moorings.


148
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,868
Awaiting port gates from this mark.


149
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,369
All moorings clear.


150
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,121
Aft thrusters.


151
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,915
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.


152
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,961
Captain, may I remind you
that regulations specify thrusters


153
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,046
only while in spacedock?


154
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,677
Jim?


155
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,557
You heard the order, Lieutenant.


156
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,726
Aye, sir.


157
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,513
Captain’'s Log, Stardate 9522.6.


158
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,934
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.


159
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,900
I could never forgive them
for the death of my boy.


160
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,988
It seems to me our mission
to escort the Chancellor


161
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,617
of the Klingon High Council
to a peace summit


162
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,453
IS problematic at best.


163
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,626
Spock says this could be
an historic occasion,


164
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,836
and I'd like to believe him,


165
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,132
but how on earth can history
get past people like me?


166
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,095
Sorry.


167
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,389
You could have knocked.


168
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:53,434
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.


169
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,686
Right.


170
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,194
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.


171
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,495
You piloted well
out of spacedock, Lieutenant.


172
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,290
I've always wanted to try that, sir.


173
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,677
You've done well, Valeris.


174
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,598
As your sponsor at the academy,


175
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,475
I have followed your career
with satisfaction,


176
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,855
and as a Vulcan,
you've exceeded my expectations.


177
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,359
I do not understand this representation.


178
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,405
It is a depiction
from ancient Earth mythology,


179
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,325
the expulsion from Paradise.


180
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,994
Why keep it in your quarters?


181
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,956
It iIs @ reminder to me
that all things end.


182
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,006
It is of endings that I wish to speak.


183
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,845
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.


184
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,015
Do you not recognise


185
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,395
that a turning point has been reached
in the affairs of the Federation?


186
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,068
History Is replete
with turning points, Lieutenant.


187
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:28,237
-You must have faith.
-Faith?


188
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,574
That the universe
will unfold as it should.


189
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,579
-But is that logical? Surely we must...
-Logic, logic and logic.


190
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:42,585
Logic is the beginning
of wisdom, Valeris,


191
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,379
not the end.


192
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:51,219
This will be my final voyage onboard
this vessel as a member of her crew.


193
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,849
Nature abhors a vacuum.


194
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,687
I intend you to replace me.


195
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,948
I could only succeed you, sir.


196
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,039
Now hear this. All officers to the Bridge.


197
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,375
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.


198
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,335
All officers to the Bridge.


199
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,854
Captain on the Bridge.


200
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,662
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?


201
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,124
Never been this close.


202
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,838
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting
our signal.


203
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,850
-Uhura, hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.


204
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,770
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.


205
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,606
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.


206
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,858
Channel is open, Captain.


207
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,569
This is the Starship Enterprise,


208
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,030
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.


209
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,866
This is Kronos One.


210
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,036
I am Chancellor Gorkon.


211
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,959
Chancellor, we've been ordered
to escort you


212
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,129
through Federation space
to your meeting on Earth.


213
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,923
Thank you, Captain.


214
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,301
Would you and your party
care to dine this evening


215
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,637
aboard the Enterprise with my officers,


216
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,723
as guests
of the United Federation of Planets?


217
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,727
We would be delighted to accept
your gracious invitation.


218
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,818
We'll make arrangements to have you
beamed aboard at 1930 hours.


219
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,111
I shall look forward to that.


220
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,913
-Well, I hope you're happy.
-Captain,


221
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,416
there is a supply
of Romulan ale aboard.


222
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,545
It might make the evening
pass more smoothly.


223
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,464
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.


224
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,219
Guess who's coming to dinner.


225
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,107
Energise.


226
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,643
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-Captain Kirk.


227
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,897
May I present Captain Spock,
whom I believe you know.


228
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,482
Captain, face to face at last.


229
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,153
-You have my thanks.
-Chancellor.


230
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,324
Gentlemen,


231
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,744
this is my daughter Azetbur,


232
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,500
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla,


233
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:57,214
and this is General Chang,
my chief of staff.


234
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:01,052
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.


235
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,513
I'm not sure how to take that.


236
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,975
Sincere admiration, Kirk.


237
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,062
From one warrior to another.


238
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,148
Right.


239
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,988
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.


240
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,550
-They all look alike.
-What about that smell?


241
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:45,012
You know only top-of-the-line models
can even talk...


242
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,644
You men have work?


243
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,229
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.


244
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,897
Then snap to it.


245
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,772
I offer a toast.


246
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,775
"The undiscover'd country,”


247
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,655
the future.


248
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,699
-"The undiscover'd country.”
-"The undiscover'd country."


249
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,243
Hamlet, Act lll, Scene 1.


250
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,995
You've not experienced Shakespeare


251
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,706
until you have read him
in the original Klingon.


252
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,345
Captain Kirk,
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.


253
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,848
One of the advantages
of being 1,000 light-years


254
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,850
from Federation Headquarters.


255
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,480
To you, Chancellor Gorkon,
one of the architects of our future.


256
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,356
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.


257
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,237
Perhaps we are looking
at something of that future here.


258
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,742
Tell me, Captain Kirk,


259
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,330
would you be willing
to give up Starfleet?


260
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,589
I believe the Captain feels
that Starfleet's mission


261
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,883
has always been one of peace.


262
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,971
Far be it for me
to dispute my first officer,


263
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,723
but Starfleet has always been
at the fore...


264
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,975
Captain, there's no need
to mince words.


265
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,145
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.


266
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,109
General, are you fond of


267
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,361
Shakespeare?


268
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,615
We do believe all planets
have a sovereign claim


269
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,450
to inalienable human rights.


270
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:15,538
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.


271
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,332
"Human rights.”


272
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,210
Why, the very name is racist.


273
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,382
The Federation is no more
than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.


274
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,385
Present company excepted, of course.


275
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,763
In any case,
we know where this is leading.


276
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,475
-The annihilation of our culture.
-That's not true.


277
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,852
-No?
-No.


278
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,688
"To be, or not to be."


279
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:44,733
That is the question which preoccupies
our people, Captain Kirk.


280
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:48,320
-We need breathing room.
-Earth, Hitler, 1938.


281
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,907
I beg your pardon?


282
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,288
Well...


283
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,085
I see we have a long way to go.


284
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,255
We must do this again sometime.


285
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,262
You don't trust me, do you?


286
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,265
I don't blame you.


287
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,686
If there is to be a brave new world,


288
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,773
our generation is going
to have the hardest time living in it.


289
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,821
Captain Spock.


290
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,698
Chancellor.


291
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,743
-Madam.
-Captain.


292
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,120
Well, most kind.


293
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:43,834
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.


294
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,881
Have we not
"heard the chimes at midnight"?


295
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,365
Thank God.


296
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,118
Did you see the way they ate?


297
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,080
Terrible table manners.


298
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,582
I doubt that our own behaviour


299
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,168
will distinguish us
in the annals of diplomacy.


300
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,962
I'm going to sleep this off.


301
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,965
Please let me know if there's some
other way we can screw up tonight.


302
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,884
I'm going to go find
a pot of black coffee.


303
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,112
The Enterprise hosted
Chancellor Gorkon and company


304
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,030
to dinner last night.


305
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:59,868
Our manners weren't exactly
Emily Post.


306
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,121
Note to the galley,


307
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,874
Romulan ale no longer to be served
at diplomatic functions.


308
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,339
Captain Kirk, will you please
jJoin me on the Bridge?


309
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,174
Captain Kirk?


310
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,558
-Captain.
Whatis it?


311
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,393
I find this curious.


312
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,644
Spock, I'm really tired.


313
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:29,189
We are reading an enormous amount
of neutron radiation.


314
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:31,775
Where?


315
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:35,070
Strangely enough,
it appears to be emanating from us.


316
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:36,697
The Enterprise?


317
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,453
Valeris, do you know anything
about a radiation surge?


318
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,038
Sir?


319
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,205
Chekov?


320
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,916
Only the size of my head.


321
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,002
I kKnow what you mean.


322
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,771
-What's happened?
-We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.


323
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,856
Torpedo Room, please confirm.


324
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,316
Have we fired?


325
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,609
...0-6. ..


326
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,944
-Uhura, monitor.
-Aye, sir.


327
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,404
Direct hit.


328
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,907
Confirmed, sir.


329
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,045
We've lost gravity!


330
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,269
We are betrayed!


331
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,773
This is the Bridge. Do you read?
Do you read?


332
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,900
Torpedo bay,
did we fire those torpedoes?


333
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,361
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory,


334
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,071
we're still fully loaded.


335
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,426
Find Chang.


336
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,269
Unable to confirm or deny
firing of two photon torpedoes.


337
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,646
-Haliling frequencies.
-Aye, sir.


338
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,776
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read? Over.


339
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,696
Repeat. Kronos One...


340
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,886
It's very hard to make out, Captain.


341
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:49,431
There's been some weapons firing
and a lot of shouting.


342
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,849
She is still listing.


343
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,185
She's spinning out of control.


344
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:16,208
Restoring auxiliary gravity.


345
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,222
Have you not a shred
of decency in you, Kirk?


346
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,185
We come in peace,
and you blatantly defile that peace.


347
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,481
For that,
I shall blow you out of the stars.


348
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,820
-We haven't fired.
-Captain.


349
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,700
According to our databanks,
we have, twice.


350
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,327
Captain, they're coming about.


351
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,087
-They're preparing to fire.
-Shields up, Captain?


352
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,465
-Captain, our shields.
-Shields up, Captain?


353
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,178
-Signal our surrender.
-Captain?


354
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,722
We surrender!


355
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,309
-This is Enterprise. We surrender.
-If they fire at us


356
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,852
-with our shields down...
-l repeat.


357
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,104
-We surrender.
-...we will not be able to respond.


358
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,398
Repeat. Enterprise surrenders.


359
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,404
-Are we firing torpedoes?
-l wish I knew.


360
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,865
Well, it sure looks like it.


361
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,617
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.


362
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,119
I am responsible
for involving you in this. I will go.


363
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,622
No, I'll go. You'll be responsible
for getting me out of this.


364
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,790
We'll not be the instigators
of full-scale war


365
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,584
on the eve of universal peace.


366
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,502
I'm going, too. They may need a doctor.


367
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,838
-Perhaps you're right.
-Uhura, tell them we're coming,


368
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,632
and tell them we're unarmed.


369
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,966
Aye, sir.


370
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,098
Have you lost your mind?


371
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,933
I give you my word,
I don't understand what has happened.


372
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,685
We're here to help.


373
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,938
Follow me.


374
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,425
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-My God.


375
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,680
-What has happened here?
-You dare to feign ignorance?


376
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,849
-What happened?
-With a direct torpedo hit,


377
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,644
you crippled
our entire gravitational field,


378
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,815
and two of your Starfleet crew
beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots


379
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:45,899
and did this.


380
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,567
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?


381
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,361
We were until this disgrace.


382
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,280
Well, then for God sakes, man,
let me help.


383
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,335
I've got a pulse. We can move him.


384
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,839
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?


385
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,350
Hold him. Hold him while I stabilise him.


386
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,817
I said hold him.


387
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,614
Sweet Jesus.


388
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,326
-Canyou...
-Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.


389
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,834
-His wounds are not closing.
-He's killing him!


390
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,925
He's gone into
some kind of damned arrest.


391
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,308
Come on, damn it! Come on!


392
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,355
He's not responding.


393
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,128
Don't let it end this way, Captain.


394
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:11,127
Under article number 184
of your interstellar law,


395
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,131
I'm placing you under arrest.


396
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:20,846
You are charged with assassinating
our Chancellor of the High Council.


397
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,722
He tried to save him.


398
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,565
They've been arrested.


399
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:35,610
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.


400
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,448
I assume command of this ship
as of 0230 hours.


401
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,535
Commander Uhura,
please notify Starfleet Headquarters.


402
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,036
Tell them precisely
what has taken place


403
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,830
-and request instructions.
-Aye, sir.


404
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,499
We cannot allow them to be taken back
to Kronos as prisoners.


405
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,169
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them,


406
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,339
and an armed conflict is precisely
what the Captain wished to avoid.


407
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,592
We will be able to follow
the Captain's movements.


408
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:02,137
-How did you achieve this, sir?
-Time is precious, Lieutenant.


409
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,724
We must endeavour to piece together
what happened here tonight.


410
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,436
According to our databank,
this ship fired those torpedoes.


411
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,729
No way.


412
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,357
I sympathise, Mr Scott,
but we need evidence.


413
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,192
Please accompany me.


414
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,655
And if we cannot
piece together what happened?


415
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,867
-What then, sir?
-In that case, Mr Chekov,


416
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,162
it resides in the purview
of the diplomats.


417
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,833
The Chancellor of the High Council
is dead!


418
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:37,505
The result of an unprovoked attack
while he travelled to see you


419
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,759
under a flag of truce,
on a mission of peace.


420
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,596
Captain Kirk was legally arrested
for the crime.


421
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,599
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy


422
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,727
boarded Kronos One
of their own free will?


423
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,563
None of these facts are in dispute,
Mr President.


424
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:56,441
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.


425
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,277
-In the meantime...
-In the meantime,


426
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:03,615
we expect the Federation to abide
by the articles of interstellar law,


427
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,700
which you claim to cherish.


428
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,787
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial


429
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,122
for the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon.


430
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,958
Out of the question.


431
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,542
Ambassador Sarek,
there must be some way


432
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,419
to extradite these men.


433
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:21,633
Mr President, I share a measure
of personal responsibility in this matter,


434
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,593
but I am obliged to confirm


435
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,429
my esteemed colleague's
legal interpretation.


436
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,515
What is the position
of the Romulan government,


437
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,141
Ambassador Nanclus?


438
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,770
I must concur with my colleagues.


439
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,023
But you can't possibly believe
that James Kirk assassinated


440
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,609
the Chancellor of the High Council.


441
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:43,279
Mr President,
I don't know what to believe.


442
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,242
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.


443
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,622
This president is not above the law.


444
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,543
Report back at once. Do you copy?
At once.


445
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,004
Enterprise to report back on the double.


446
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,505
Do you read? At once.


447
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,257
We're to report back at once.


448
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,759
We cannot abandon
Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.


449
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,344
Of course not.


450
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,847
Four hundred years ago
on the planet Earth,


451
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,058
workers who felt their livelihood
threatened by automation


452
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:17,522
flung their wooden shoes called "sabot"
into the machines to stop them.


453
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,194
Hence the word "sabotage.”


454
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,616
We are experiencing
technical malfunction.


455
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,077
All backup systems inoperative.


456
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,789
Excellent. I mean, too bad.


457
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,709
Mr President,


458
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,045
I've been named Chancellor
by the High Council


459
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,921
In my father's place.


460
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,673
Madam Chancellor,


461
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:46,718
you have my sincerest condolences
on your recent loss.


462
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,471
I want to assure you
that this shameful deed will not...


463
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,640
Mr President, let us come to the point.


464
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,519
You want this conference
to go forward, and so did my father.


465
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:00,190
I will attend in one week
on one condition.


466
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,567
We will not extradite the prisoners,


467
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,905
and you will make no attempt
to rescue them in a military operation.


468
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,742
We would consider any such attempt
an act of war.


469
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,078
We hope you'll be our guest
here on Earth.


470
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:18,208
After recent events, you will understand
if I say I prefer a neutral site,


471
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,671
and in the Iinterests of security,
let us keep the location secret for now.


472
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:26,674
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.


473
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:31,763
Attack them now, while we still can!


474
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,934
Attack or be slaves in their world.


475
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,149
We can take whole by force,
what they propose to divide.


476
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:51,825
War is obsolete, General,
as we are in danger of becoming.


477
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:59,541
Better to die on our feet
than live on our knees.


478
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,294
That wasn't what my father wanted.


479
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,422
Your father was killed
for what he wanted.


480
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,760
The peace process will go forward.


481
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,097
Kirk...


482
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,063
Kirk will pay for my father's death.


483
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,443
-Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk!


484
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,907
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!


485
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,705
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!


486
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:44,627
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!


487
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:50,300
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!


488
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,681
It's a damn show trial.


489
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,434
-Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk!


490
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,030
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One
without provocation.


491
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,741
The Chancellor and his advisers...


492
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,744
...having been lulled
into a false sense of security


493
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:21,372
by an invitation to a state dinner
aboard Captain Kirk's vessel


494
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:25,460
at precisely 1930 hours
that same evening.


495
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,129
Call your first witness.


496
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,050
After the first shot,
we lost our gravitational field.


497
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,802
I found myself weightless
and unable to function.


498
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,972
Then two Starfleet crewmen
came walking towards me.


499
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,516
But perhaps they merely wore
Starfleet uniforms.


500
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,895
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.


501
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:48,149
Colonel Worf,
we are interested in facts, not theories.


502
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,070
If the gravitational unit
was not functioning,


503
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,072
how could these men be walking?


504
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,491
They appeared to be wearing
magnetic boots.


505
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,536
Gravity boots.


506
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:06,834
Dr McCoy,
would you be so good as to tell me,


507
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,505
what is your current medical status?


508
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,426
Aside from a touch of arthritis,
I'd say pretty good.


509
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,019
You have a singular wit, Doctor.


510
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:29,691
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon
aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.


511
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,360
In three months, I stand down.


512
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,200
You know, I believe that you consumed


513
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:43,454
a rather generous amount
of Romulan ale in the officers' mess


514
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,248
on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?


515
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,458
-Objection!
-Sustained.


516
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,336
We all did. All of us.


517
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:55,300
-That doesn't mean...
-Was Chancellor Gorkon alive


518
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,302
when you first examined him?


519
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,138
-Barely.
-Now be careful, Doctor.


520
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:07,061
Have you ever, in your past,
saved patients as barely alive as he?


521
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,565
I didn't have the medical knowledge
I needed for Klingon anatomy.


522
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,942
-I see.
-You were there.


523
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,446
You say you are due for retirement.


524
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,365
May I ask, do your hands shake?


525
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,492
-Objection!
-l was nervous.


526
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:24,579
No.


527
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,415
You were incompetent.


528
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,377
You were incompetent!


529
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,757
Whether deliberately or as a result
of age combined with drink,


530
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:41,262
-the court will have to determine.
-My God, man! I tried to save him!


531
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,015
I tried to save him.


532
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,353
I was desperate to save him.


533
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,775
He was the last best hope
in the universe for peace.


534
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,652
The withess Is excused.


535
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,117
There we have it, citizens.


536
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,704
We have finally established
the particulars of the crime,


537
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:11,459
and now we come to the architect
of this tragic affair,


538
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:16,964
James Tiberius Kirk.


539
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,095
What would
your favourite author say, Captain?


540
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:23,971
"Let us sit upon the ground


541
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,974
"and tell sad stories
of the death of kings."


542
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,144
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.


543
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,108
Tell us that you planned to take revenge
for the death of your son.


544
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,403
-That's not true.
-Objection!


545
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:41,447
Captain Kirk has not been identified
as the assassin.


546
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,157
Sustained.


547
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,451
I offer into the record


548
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,414
this excerpt
from the Captain's personal log.


549
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,419
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.


550
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:59,590
I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.


551
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,721
Again. Again!


552
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,350
I've never trusted Klingons,
and I never will.


553
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,938
I have never been able to forgive them
for the death of my boy.


554
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,235
Are those your words?


555
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,866
Those words were spoken by me.


556
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,288
Objection!


557
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:33,124
My client's political views
are not on trial here.


558
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,210
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives


559
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,130
are indeed
at the very heart of the matter.


560
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,300
This officer's record
shows him to be an insubordinate,


561
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,678
unprincipled,
career-minded opportunist,


562
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,930
with a history of violating
the chain of command


563
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,474
whenever it suited him!


564
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:50,975
Continue.


565
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,644
Indeed, the record shows
that Captain Kirk


566
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,438
once held the rank of Admiral,


567
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,858
and that Admiral Kirk was broken
for taking matters into his own hands


568
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,568
In defiance of regulations of the law.


569
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,445
Do you deny being demoted
for these charges?


570
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,448
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!


571
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,657
I cannot deny it.


572
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,326
-You were demoted?
-Yes.


573
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,747
-For insubordination?
-On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.


574
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,875
And were you obeying
or disobeying orders


575
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,045
when you arranged the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon?


576
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,839
I didn't know about the assassination
until we boarded the ship.


577
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,800
You still deny the Enterprise
fired on Kronos One?


578
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,844
-Well...
-Your Honours, please!


579
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:30,056
And you still deny your men beamed
aboard and shot the Chancellor?


580
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,265
Objection!


581
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,935
I cannot confirm or deny actions
I did not witness.


582
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,478
Captain Kirk,


583
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,482
dare you aware
that as the captain of a starship,


584
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,736
you are required to be responsible
for the actions of your men?


585
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,657
I am.


586
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,993
And if it should be proved
that members of your crew


587
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,247
did, in fact,
carry out such an assassination...


588
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,499
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honours...


589
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,583
Do not answer!


590
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,962
Captain Kirk,
you will answer the question.


591
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,429
As captain,


592
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,102
I am responsible for the conduct
of the crew under my command.


593
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:21,941
Your Honours, the State rests.


594
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:26,362
Send to Commander Enterprise.


595
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:31,951
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior.”


596
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:39,208
It is the determination of this court
that the prisoners are guilty as charged.


597
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,763
I wish to note for the record


598
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:56,601
that the evidence against my clients
is entirely circumstantial.


599
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,730
I beg the court to consider this
when pronouncing its sentence.


600
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:02,440
So noted.


601
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:06,736
Captain James T. Kirk,
Dr Leonard McCoy,


602
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:13,117
In the interest of fostering amity
for the forthcoming peace talks,


603
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,371
the sentence of death Is commuted.


604
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:28,132
It is the judgement of this court


605
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,638
that, without possibility of reprieve
or parole,


606
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,641
you be taken from this place


607
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:43,522
to the dilithium mines
on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe,


608
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:48,986
there to spend
the rest of your natural lives.


609
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,704
Rura Penthe?


610
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,960
Known throughout the galaxy
as the aliens' graveyard.


611
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,756
Better to kill them now
and get it over with.


612
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:34,281
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit
once again, please.


613
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,830
Hold.


614
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,333
It is Enterprise.


615
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,337
-We fired.
-That is not possible.


616
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:52,007
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.


617
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,138
An ancestor of mine maintained
that if you eliminate the impossible,


618
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:01,183
whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth.


619
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,811
What exactly does that mean?


620
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,523
It means that if we cannot
have fired those torpedoes,


621
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,150
someone else did.


622
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:13,362
Well, they did not fire on themselves,
and there were no other ships present.


623
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:16,073
There was
an enormous neutron energy surge.


624
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,199
Not from us!


625
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:21,704
A neutron surge that big
could only be produced by another ship.


626
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,039
Kronos One?


627
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:25,875
Too far away.


628
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,962
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.


629
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:34,550
If there were a ship beneath us,
the Klingons would have seen her.


630
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,471
Would they?


631
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:45,186
-A bird-of-prey.
-A bird-of-prey.


632
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,231
Cloaked?


633
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:52,359
A bird-of-prey cannot fire
when she's cloaked.


634
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:56,113
All things being equal, Mr Scott,
I would agree.


635
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,491
However, things are not equal.


636
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,618
This one can.


637
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,661
We must inform Starfleet Command.


638
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:06,749
Inform them of what,
a new weapon that is invisible?


639
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,126
Raving lunatics,
that's what they'll call us.


640
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,421
They'll say that we're so desperate
to exonerate the Captain


641
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:14,089
that we'll say anything.


642
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,426
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence,


643
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,554
only a theory
which happens to fit the facts.


644
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,224
Assuming you're right, Mr Spock,


645
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,893
why would they fire
on their own president?


646
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,186
Indeed.


647
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,855
This ship will be searched
from bow to stern.


648
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,482
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.


649
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,943
-Aye, sir.
-] do not understand.


650
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,737
If there was a ship underneath us,


651
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,657
surely the assassins
beamed aboard from that vessel,


652
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,158
not Enterprise.


653
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,953
You're forgetting something,
Mr Chekov.


654
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:48,415
According to our databanks,
this ship fired those torpedoes.


655
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,168
If we did, the killers are here.


656
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:55,714
If we did not,
whoever altered the databanks is here.


657
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:59,885
In either case,
what we are looking for is here.


658
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,305
What are we looking for, sir?


659
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,766
L ieutenant?


660
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,103
Two pairs of gravity boots.


661
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:18,380
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.


662
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,093
There is no stockade, no guard tower,


663
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,138
no electronic frontier.


664
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,392
Only a magnetic shield
prevents beaming.


665
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:36,315
Punishment means exile
from prison to the surface.


666
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:41,028
On the surface, nothing can survive.


667
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:49,203
Work well and you will be treated well.


668
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,791
Work badly and you will die.


669
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,296
Oh, my God.


670
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,971
The universal translator's
been confiscated.


671
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,141
I'm sorry?


672
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:41,774
He's definitely on about something, Jim.


673
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,323
If this is your spot, we'll move on.


674
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,993
He wants your obedience
to the brotherhood of aliens.


675
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,370
-He's got it.
-And your coat.


676
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,165
I'm afraid not. Besides, it wouldn't fit.


677
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,181
Thanks.


678
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,892
This will help keep you warm.


679
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,730
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.


680
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:24,858
How'd you know that?


681
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,361
We don't get many
presidential assassins.


682
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,072
-We didn't kill Gorkon.
-Of course not,


683
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:34,785
-but there is a reward for your death.
-It figures.


684
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,454
We've been set up all along.


685
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,374
Somebody up there
wants you out of the way.


686
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,881
-Nothing in here.
-Nothing here.


687
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,633
-Any progress?
-None.


688
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,845
We have a crew of 300
turning their own quarters inside out,


689
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,305
but the killers may still be among them.


690
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,475
Surely they have disposed
of these boots by now.


691
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,979
Would it not have been logical
to have left them on Gorkon's ship?


692
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,481
Even logic must give way to physics.


693
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,151
Gravity had not been restored
by the time they escaped.


694
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,485
Without the boots,


695
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:11,905
they would have floated off
the Klingon transporter pads.


696
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,533
Why not simply vapourize them?


697
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:18,954
Like this?


698
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,212
At ease.


699
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,966
As you know, Commander Chekov,
no one can fire an unauthorised phaser


700
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,718
aboard a starship.


701
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,848
Suppose when they returned,
they threw the boots into the refuse.


702
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:42,311
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct,


703
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,354
those boots will cling
to the killers' necks


704
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,607
like a pair of Tiberian bats.


705
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,692
They could not
make their escape without them,


706
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,904
nor can they simply throw them
out the window for all to see.


707
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:56,325
-Those boots are here somewhere.
-Did someone fire off a phaser?


708
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,494
It's all right. It's nothing. It's nothing.


709
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,458
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us
to return to port.


710
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,212
-Who fired that...
-Mr Scott.


711
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,215
I understand you're having difficulty
with the warp drive.


712
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,217
How much time
do you require for repair?


713
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,052
There's nothing wrong
with the bloody thing.


714
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,804
Mr Scott, if we return to spacedock,


715
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,182
the assassins will surely find a way


716
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,517
to dispose
of their incriminating footwear,


717
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:26,688
and we will never see
the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.


718
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,108
-It could take weeks, sir.
-Thank you, Mr Scott.


719
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,402
Valeris, please inform
Starfleet Command


720
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,155
-our warp drive is inoperative.
-A lie?


721
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,990
An error.


722
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:42,079
You understand we have lost all contact
with the Captain and Dr McCoy.


723
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,332
Yes. At the moment, they're surrounded
by a magnetic shield.


724
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:49,086
However, if I know the Captain,
by this time,


725
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,672
he is deep into planning his escape.


726
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,073
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!


727
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,627
-You all right, Jim?
-1 think so.


728
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:15,130
-They'll respect you now.
-That's a comfort.


729
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,842
-I was lucky that thing had knees.
-That was not his knee.


730
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,138
Not everybody keeps their genitals
in the same place, Captain.


731
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,224
Anything you want to tell me?


732
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:29,686
Bones, why don't you see
what you can do for him?


733
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,481
Let him know
we're not holding a grudge.


734
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,941
Suppose he's holding a grudge?


735
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:41,448
When whoever it iIs makes their move,
you won't be here to ask if he's the one.


736
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:50,123
-Do you want to get out of here?
-There's gotta be a way.


737
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,523
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.


738
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:18,235
-We're not finished.
-No? Speak for yourself.


739
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:22,697
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.


740
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,368
Bones, are you afraid of the future?


741
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:33,250
I believe that was the general idea
that I was trying to convey.


742
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:35,335
I don't mean this future.


743
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,549
-What is this, multiple choice?
-Some people are afraid


744
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,344
of what might happen.


745
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,681
I was terrified.


746
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,725
What terrified you, specifically?


747
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,900
No more neutral zone.


748
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,530
I was used to hating Klingons.


749
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,996
It never even occurred to me
to take Gorkon at his word.


750
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,792
Spock was right.


751
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,005
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.


752
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,131
No.


753
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,551
Somebody felt a lot worse.


754
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,597
I'm beginning to understand why.


755
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:32,601
Well, if you've got any bright ideas,
now's the time.


756
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,896
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.


757
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,983
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.


758
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:44,196
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound
to attempt another assassination.


759
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:49,034
Unless we can get out of here.


760
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,005
Kirk, it's me, Martia.


761
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,425
Listen, no one has ever escaped
from Rura Penthe.


762
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,512
-Except us.
-It is possible.


763
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:13,433
-I know how to get outside the shield.
-How do we fit in?


764
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,936
Getting outside the shield is easy,


765
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:19,773
but after that, it's up to you to get us
off the surface before we freeze.


766
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,107
Can you?


767
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,237
-It's possible.
-I can't make it alone,


768
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:30,700
and you're likeliest candidate
to come in this hellhole for months.


769
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,536
Candidate for what?


770
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,387
Go to lift seven in the morning
for mining duty.


771
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,598
I'll see you there. Don't disappoint me.


772
01:04:56,977 --> 01:05:00,605
-What is it with you, anyway?
-Still think we're finished?


773
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,440
More than ever.


774
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,781
-I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
-What is it?


775
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,075
Starfleet urgently requests
any data we have


776
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:14,619
on the whereabouts of Enterprise.


777
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:18,498
What?


778
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,251
Well, apparently, they're refusing
to acknowledge signal


779
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,503
to return to spacedock, sir.


780
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:31,720
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea
location Enterprise.


781
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:33,847
Sir?


782
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:38,184
-You have hearing problems, mister?
-No, sir.


783
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:23,647
Klingon blood.


784
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,858
They must have walked through it
when it was floating


785
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,943
and tracked it back here.


786
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,156
This is the first evidence
which corroborates our theory.


787
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,491
Now we go to Starfleet.


788
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:38,203
Now we expand our search
to include uniforms.


789
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,914
All uniforms?


790
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,172
Take those out.


791
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,764
-Continue scanning.
-Nothing, sir.


792
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,018
Clear, sir.


793
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,980
Coming through. Coming through.


794
01:07:07,816 --> 01:07:09,859
Computer well seven clear.


795
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,197
Nothing. Nothing.


796
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,618
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing. Nothing so far.


797
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,328
Sir! Sirl


798
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,113
-I think we've been had.
-No, you weren't, Doctor.


799
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:59,492
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.


800
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,828
They don't take girls.


801
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,549
You are Crewman Dax?


802
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,635
Yes, Commander. What is the problem?


803
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:22,849
Perhaps you know
Russian epic of Cinderella?


804
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,730
If shoe fits, wear it.


805
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,025
Mr Chekov.


806
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,209
Watch me.


807
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:54,839
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...


808
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:56,549
Don't remind me.


809
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,637
Get in.


810
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,460
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.


811
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,313
Hurry.


812
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,735
Up there.


813
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,864
Come on, climb.


814
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,669
Here. You'll need these. Quickly!


815
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,692
Stay close.


816
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:37,729
There they are.


817
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,189
They're emerging
from the beaming shield.


818
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,734
-Mr Scott, start your engines.
-Aye, aye, sir.


819
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:45,528
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.


820
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:49,323
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe
is deep inside the Klingon frontier.


821
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,243
-If we are discovered...
-Quite correct, Mr Chekowv.


822
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,079
What is required now
is a feat of linguistic legerdemain


823
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,165
and a degree of intrepidity


824
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,834
before the Captain and Dr McCoy
freeze to death.


825
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,552
-Leave me. I'm finished.
-No!


826
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:15,099
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch
on my back.


827
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:19,187
Spock slapped it there
just before we went on Gorkon's ship.


828
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:24,776
-Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
-Come on. We're in the clear.


829
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,404
Now that we're outside the shield,


830
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,157
they'll be able to locate us
two sectors away.


831
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,493
If they're even looking for us.


832
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,983
This is listening post Morska.


833
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,529
What ship is that? Over.


834
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,792
We must respond personally.


835
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,628
A universal translator
would be recognised.


836
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,515
We am thy freighter Ursva.


837
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,394
Six weeks out of


838
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,063
Kronos.


839
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,997
What is your destination? Over.


840
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,921
We is condemning food,


841
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,635
things and supplies.


842
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:22,268
Don't catch any bugs!


843
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,552
Would you mind explaining
that little trick you do?


844
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:00,348
-I'm a chameloid.
-I've heard about you.


845
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,559
Shapeshifters.


846
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:09,232
-1 thought you were mythical.
-Give a girl a chance, Captain.


847
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:15,071
-It takes a lot of effort.
-1 don't doubt it.


848
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,449
Stop me if I'm wrong,


849
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:22,787
but do we have any way of knowing
whether this is the real you?


850
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,082
I thought I would assume
a pleasing shape.


851
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,425
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.


852
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:38,970
If you say so.


853
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,515
Are you crazy?


854
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:44,183
She didn't need our help
getting anywhere.


855
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:46,102
Where'd you get
these convenient clothes?


856
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,063
Don't tell me that flare
is standard prison issue.


857
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:53,526
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.


858
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:55,111
A full pardon,


859
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,155
which doesn't cover this.


860
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,325
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.


861
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,454
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.


862
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:11,168
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.


863
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,133
Surprise!


864
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,981
-Your friends are late.
-They'll be along.


865
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:39,780
-l can't believe I kissed you.
-Must have been your lifelong ambition.


866
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,673
Isn't it about time
you became something else?


867
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,300
I like It here.


868
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:11,645
Well, well, well.


869
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:21,280
What took you so long?


870
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,452
-Kill him. He's the one.
-Not me, you idiot. Him!


871
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:32,625
-No witnesses.
-Killed while trying to escape.


872
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:36,754
-Damn clever, if you ask me.
-It's a classic.


873
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,424
-That's what he wanted.
-Who? Who wanted us killed?


874
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,970
Since you're all going to die anyway,
why not tell you?


875
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:47,014
His name Is...


876
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:57,608
Damn it to helll Of all the... Son of a...


877
01:18:57,942 --> 01:19:00,069
-Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
-Captain?


878
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,279
He was just about to explain
the whole thing.


879
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,656
You want to go back?


880
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,242
-Absolutely not!
-It's cold.


881
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,746
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.


882
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:15,876
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.


883
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,912
They were beamed aboard
a Federation starship.


884
01:19:52,163 --> 01:19:54,748
I could trace...


885
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,090
Escaped.


886
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:08,971
Kirk cannot know the location
of the peace conference.


887
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:11,891
Are you sure?


888
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,895
Will you take that chance?


889
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,441
Helmsman, make course
to intercept Enterprise.


890
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,032
The Klingons have a new weapon,


891
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,034
a bird-of-prey that can fire
when cloaked.


892
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,369
-She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
-So that's it.


893
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:35,080
Not entirely. I have reason to believe
that Gorkon's murderers


894
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,917
-are aboard this vessel.
-I have a thought about that.


895
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,376
Has the peace conference begun?


896
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,253
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.


897
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,172
-There's always something.
-Captain!


898
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:48,052
Mr Spock! I found the missing uniforms
with the Klingon blood on them.


899
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:06,904
But the uniforms belong
to these two men,


900
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,240
Burke and Samno.


901
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:13,244
Not any more.
Phaser on stun at close range.


902
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,539
First rule of assassination,
kill the assassins.


903
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:20,793
-Now we're back to square one.
-Can I talk to you?


904
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:26,048
I wonder why they weren't vapourized.


905
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,176
It would set off the alarm.


906
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:37,810
It's possible.


907
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:43,983
Now hear this. Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.


908
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:48,153
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once


909
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:53,450
from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat. Court reporter to sickbay.


910
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:56,787
Code Blue. Urgent.
Statements to be taken.


911
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:01,834
Repeat. Statements to be taken
from yeomen Burke and Samno.


912
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:42,541
You have to shoot.


913
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:50,382
If you are logical, you have to shoot.


914
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,472
I do not want to.


915
01:22:56,555 --> 01:23:00,225
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.


916
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:03,520
I'd just as soon you didn't.


917
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,988
The operation is over.


918
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,581
I did not fire. You cannot prove anything.


919
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:27,503
Yes, I can. At my trial,
my personal log was used against me.


920
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,840
How long did you wait outside
my quarters before I noticed you?


921
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,052
You knew?


922
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:40,307
I tried to tell you,
but you would not listen.


923
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,478
Neither of us was hearing
very well that night, Lieutenant.


924
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:48,107
There were things I tried to tell you
about having faith.


925
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,776
You have betrayed the Federation.


926
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,153
All of you.


927
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,030
And what do you think
you've been doing?


928
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:58,742
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.


929
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:01,036
Sir.


930
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,457
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.


931
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,461
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.


932
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,463
Did I misinterpret you?


933
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,093
And you were right.


934
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:20,723
They conspired with us
to assassinate their own chancellor.


935
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:22,975
How trustworthy can they be?


936
01:24:23,434 --> 01:24:27,062
Klingons and Federation members
conspiring together?


937
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:28,897
Who is "us'?


938
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:31,650
Everyone who stands
to lose from peace.


939
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:35,904
-Names, Lieutenant.
-My comrades will make certain


940
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:39,241
all your ship-to-shore transmissions
are jammed.


941
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,993
Names, Lieutenant.


942
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,704
I do not remember.


943
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,000
A lie?


944
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,211
A choice.


945
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,134
Spock?


946
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:44,473
Admiral Cartwright.


947
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,226
From Starfleet?


948
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:56,485
Who else?


949
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,200
-General...
-General...


950
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,911
-...Chang.
-...Chang.


951
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,252
Who else?


952
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,671
-Romulan...
-Romulan...


953
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,506
-...Ambassador...
-...Ambassador...


954
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,258
-...Nanclus.
-...Nanclus.


955
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,347
Where Is the peace conference?


956
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,852
Where Is the peace conference?


957
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:05,429
She does not know.


958
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,474
Then we're dead.


959
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,322
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.


960
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,785
-She'll have the coordinates.
-I've already got him, sir.


961
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:31,413
Standing by, Captain Kirk.


962
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:32,581
Sulu!


963
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:37,210
You realise that by even talking to us,
you're violating regulations.


964
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:40,172
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.


965
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:43,342
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?


966
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,136
They're going to attempt
another assassination.


967
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:49,973
The conference is at Camp Khitomer,
nhear the Romulan border.


968
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:54,269
I'm sending the exact coordinates
on a coded frequency.


969
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,355
I'm afraid
we're gonna need more than that.


970
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,982
There's a bird-of-prey
on the lookout for us,


971
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,609
and she can fire while cloaked.


972
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,110
Surely not.


973
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:05,072
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?


974
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:07,240
Come on, Lieutenant.


975
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:10,577
-Just the prototype.
-You hear that?


976
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:14,790
I'm getting underway now,
but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.


977
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:18,251
The chances of our reaching
the conference in time are slim.


978
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:20,671
When does this conference start?


979
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,256
According to my information, today.


980
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,385
Thank you, Captain Sulu.


981
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,095
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.


982
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,061
Spock?


983
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,106
I prefer it dark.


984
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:47,990
Dining on ashes?


985
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:50,492
You were right.


986
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:56,331
It was arrogant presumption on my part
that got us into this situation.


987
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,086
You and the doctor
might have been killed.


988
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,505
The night is young.


989
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:08,927
You said it yourself. It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.


990
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,017
You're a great one for logic.


991
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,729
I'm a great one for rushing in
where angels fear to tread.


992
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,274
We're both extremists.


993
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,694
Reality is probably
somewhere in between.


994
01:29:30,782 --> 01:29:33,535
I couldn't get past the death of my son.


995
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,998
I was prejudiced
by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.


996
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:42,794
Gorkon had to die before I understood
how prejudiced I was.


997
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:55,098
Is it possible that we two, you and I,


998
01:29:56,058 --> 01:30:00,395
have grown so old and so inflexible


999
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,899
that we have outlived our usefulhess?


1000
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,695
Would that constitute a joke?


1001
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,407
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.


1002
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:14,159
I was responsible.


1003
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:19,873
-For no actions but your own.
-That is not what you said at your trial.


1004
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,418
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...


1005
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,797
But, Captain, we both know
that I am not human.


1006
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:30,675
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.


1007
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,846
I find that remark insulting.


1008
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,432
Come on. I need you.


1009
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:43,605
Madam Chancellor,


1010
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:48,693
members of the Diplomatic Corps,
honoured guests,


1011
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:54,282
the United Federation of Planets
welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.


1012
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,760
She's out here somewhere.


1013
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,179
But if she Is cloaked...


1014
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,974
Then all we have
IS a neutron radiation surge,


1015
01:31:19,057 --> 01:31:22,144
and by the time we're close enough
to record it, we're ashes.


1016
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,645
209.


1017
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:27,858
206.


1018
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,988
203.


1019
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:39,327
-Close enough to beam down?
-Not yet, Captain. In two minutes. 158.


1020
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:44,499
-Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
-Aye, sir.


1021
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:58,638
Let us redefine progress to mean
that just because we can do a thing,


1022
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:03,143
it does not necessarily follow
that we must do that thing.


1023
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,024
-Uhura?
-Nothing, Captain.


1024
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,819
If she's here,
she's rigged for silent running.


1025
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:22,787
Coming up on transporter range
in 57 seconds.


1026
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:26,458
Transporter Room,
stand by to beam down.


1027
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:30,670
.53 ..


1028
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,885
...48 seconds.


1029
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,433
.. 44. ..


1030
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:48,563
[ can see you, Kirk.


1031
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:51,650
Chang.


1032
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,361
Can you see me?


1033
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:59,574
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior,


1034
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:04,120
you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.


1035
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:07,040
No peace in our time.


1036
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:12,504
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends.”


1037
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,773
-This is fun.
-Reverse engines. All astern.


1038
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:35,026
One and a half impulse power.
Back off! Back off!


1039
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:41,032
What's she doing?


1040
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:43,702
What's she waiting for?


1041
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:48,123
Probably attempting to ascertain
why we are reversing,


1042
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,875
wondering whether we detect her.


1043
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,465
Incoming!


1044
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,472
-In range?
-Not yet, sir.


1045
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:05,974
Come on. Come on.


1046
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:08,059
-She'll fly apart.
-Fly her apart, then!


1047
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:12,439
Many speculated
about my father's motives.


1048
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:16,693
There were those who said
he was an idealist.


1049
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:19,070
Others said he had no choice.


1050
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,408
If Praxis had not exploded,
then quite possibly his idealism


1051
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:28,204
would not have found expression.
We are a proud race,


1052
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:33,501
and we are here because
we intend to go on being proud.


1053
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:47,432
-Go to auxiliary power!
-Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.


1054
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:57,442
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?


1055
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,444
"Wrong us,


1056
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:02,530
"shall we not revenge?"


1057
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:04,574
Gas.


1058
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:10,997
Gas, Captain. Under impulse power,
she expends fuel like any other vessel.


1059
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,042
We call it plasma,
but whatever the Klingon designation,


1060
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,378
it Is merely ionized gas.


1061
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:19,714
Well, what about all
of that equipment we're carrying


1062
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:21,966
to catalogue gaseous anomalies?


1063
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:28,890
-Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
-Doctor, would you care to assist me


1064
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:32,310
-In performing surgery on a torpedo?
-Fascinating.


1065
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:35,855
Hard to starboard!


1066
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:42,278
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos


1067
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:46,116
has been calculated
within the 50-Earth-year time span.


1068
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:48,701
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.


1069
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,168
Come on, reach up!


1070
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:02,966
Captain! She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!


1071
01:36:10,849 --> 01:36:12,851
Shields up. All right.


1072
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:14,853
Now we've given them
something else to shoot at.


1073
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,187
Aye, sir.


1074
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,737
The game's afoot, huh?


1075
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:37,041
-Excelsior's been hit.
-"Our revels now are ended,” Kirk.


1076
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:50,889
"Cry 'Havoc!'
and let slip the dogs of war."


1077
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:54,058
Bones, where's my torpedo?


1078
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:55,810
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.


1079
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:57,979
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!


1080
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,772
Shields collapsing!


1081
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,194
The key, please, Doctor. Time is short.


1082
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,412
The hull has been compromised.


1083
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:17,081
-l wonder how bad?
-Connect echobars.


1084
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,792
...to discuss the report on phase two.


1085
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:22,921
-Alter circuit "A."
-Sensor.


1086
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:26,174
I propose that we commence
with the minutes of the preparation.


1087
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:29,177
“I am constant as the northern star.”


1088
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,804
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.


1089
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,223
-Plate, please.
-Plate.


1090
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:35,058
...and assimilation will consume...


1091
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:37,018
We've got a heartbeat.


1092
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,188
The Klingon empire, the ecological...


1093
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,065
-Key, please.
-Key.


1094
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:43,566
Where's that damn torpedo?


1095
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,985
She's ready, Jim. Lock and load.


1096
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:49,739
Fire.


1097
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:03,795
To be,


1098
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,672
or not


1099
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:07,799
to be.


1100
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:11,636
Target that explosion and fire.


1101
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:14,597
Fire.


1102
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:27,402
As I imagine this work will occupy us


1103
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:30,363
throughout most of the week,
it would be my hope


1104
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:32,865
that the delegation
could return to their capitals


1105
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:35,368
to implement the provisions
of phase one,


1106
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:37,704
hno later than the first of next month.


1107
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:38,788
Scotty.


1108
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:41,374
As you know, time is of the essence.


1109
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:44,669
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!


1110
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:47,589
Mr President!


1111
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:51,718
Mr President! Mr President!


1112
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:54,178
Mr President!


1113
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:57,932
Kirk, Enterprise.


1114
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:01,603
Protect the Chancellor!


1115
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:11,571
-Arrest those men!
-Arrest yourself.


1116
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:18,953
We've got a full confession.


1117
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:36,054
Cartwright, just a minute.


1118
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,684
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?


1119
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,896
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.


1120
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:48,316
Some people think the future
means the end of history.


1121
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,403
Well, we haven't run out
of history quite yet.


1122
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:58,076
Your father called the future


1123
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,245
the undiscovered country.


1124
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:07,418
People can be very frightened
of change.


1125
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:14,884
You've restored my father's faith.


1126
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:18,012
And you've restored my son's.


1127
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:09,731
Once again, we've saved civilisation
as we know it.


1128
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:12,275
And the good news is,
they're not going to prosecute.


1129
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:16,237
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.


1130
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,198
Well, they don't arrest people
for having feelings.


1131
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:23,870
And it's a good thing, too. If they did,
we'd all have to turn ourselves in.


1132
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:27,457
Captain Kirk.


1133
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,459
Captain Sulu.


1134
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:34,130
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,
I owe you my thanks.


1135
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:38,217
Nice to see you in action
one more time, Captain Kirk.


1136
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,136
Take care.


1137
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:54,358
By God, that's a big ship.


1138
01:41:54,817 --> 01:42:00,782
-Not so big as her captain, I think.
-S0, this is goodbye.


1139
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:05,286
I think it's about time
we got underway ourselves.


1140
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:08,748
Captain, I have orders
from Starfleet Command.


1141
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,542
We're to put back
to spacedock immediately


1142
01:42:11,626 --> 01:42:13,419
to be decommissioned.


1143
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,228
If I were human,


1144
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:33,231
I believe my response would be,


1145
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,900
"Go to hell."


1146
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:41,280
If I were human.


1147
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,620
Course heading, Captain?


1148
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:55,920
Second star to the right,


1149
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,882
and straight on till morning.


1150
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,403
Captain’'s Log, Stardate 9529.1.


1151
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:23,948
This is the final cruise
of the Starship Enterprise


1152
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:25,533
under my command.


1153
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:31,038
This ship and her history will shortly
become the care of another crew.


1154
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:34,542
To them and their posterity
will we commit our future.


1155
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:37,670
They will continue the voyages
we have begun,


1156
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:40,214
and journey to all
the undiscovered countries,


1157
01:43:40,298 --> 01:43:42,466
boldly going where no man...


1158
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:44,802
Where no one


1159
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:47,138
has gone before.
