1
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:53,238
You're going the wrong way!

2
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,933
Franklin!

3
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,580
What the hell's wrong with you?

4
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,547
You bastard!

5
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,948
You all right?

6
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,695
Who's that?

7
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,092
Your momma!

8
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,156
Franklin, you forgot your coat.

9
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,463
- I'm going to dunk on you.
- You couldn't dunk doughnuts.

10
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:23,600
A dollar!

11
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:24,861
You got it.

12
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,868
Step aside, chump.

13
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,740
Pay up, sucker!

14
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,214
Christ!

15
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:10,519
Do you recognize this man as
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jones?

16
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,391
What was your...

17
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,396
...relationship with the deceased?

18
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,668
He was my Avon lady.

19
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,565
- Give me a break.
- Give me a break!

20
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,434
You think this is
a thrilling morning for me?

21
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,666
Eat an Egg McMuffin,
look at a dead guy.

22
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,708
Look, honey, I--

23
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,571
I'm not your honey.

24
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,373
It's Belinda.

25
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,151
As a matter of fact,
it's Miss Keaton.

26
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,320
Are you listening to this?

27
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,755
She's a whore.

28
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,455
Hello.

29
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,487
And this guy here was her pimp!

30
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,063
He didn't pay off someone
like he was supposed to...

31
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,996
...so somebody made him
kiss the sidewalk.

32
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,199
Can I close the drawer now?

33
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,632
Sure.

34
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,975
All right. Now can you tell me
who sent him to pimp heaven?

35
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,544
- Sure! Now can you kiss my ass?
- For how much?

36
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:05,410
Is someone going to pick up Mr. Jones?
We sure could use the space.

37
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,313
You've got it, sport.

38
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:10,922
Sir, could you sign right here?

39
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,681
Excuse me.

40
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,486
Franklin once told me that
he wanted to be buried in his car.

41
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,859
We don't do that.

42
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,397
You'd probably have to call
the funeral home...

43
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,399
...or the Department of Motor Vehicles.

44
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,535
Don't I know you?

45
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,473
Yeah, I do. I do.

46
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,668
No. I couldn't.

47
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,903
I wouldn't!

48
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,672
I'm engaged.

49
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,444
Here's a picture
of my fiancée, Charlotte.

50
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,016
The picture doesn't do her justice.

51
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,521
She's suffering from water buildup.

52
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:47,987
I thought I knew you.

53
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,560
A lot of guys have my face.

54
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,090
This is my mom.

55
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,626
- You okay, Chuck?
- Thanks for waiting.

56
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:58,803
I'm taking off.

57
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,995
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

58
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,303
Hi, Mr. Carboni.

59
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,973
Ain't you going home?

60
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,875
Hector's an hour late.
It's seven o'clock.

61
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,608
- Hector's been transferred.
- You got a new night man.

62
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,277
Not exactly. Starting tomorrow,
you're on night shift.

63
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,989
Night shift?

64
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,552
I started on night shift.

65
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,785
I'm here 6 years.
I thought I'd get a raise--

66
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,227
Are you going to make trouble?
Are you going to go over my head?

67
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,233
Night shift?

68
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,299
Hey, Chuckie, baby!

69
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:39,235
Come on!
Night shift's better!

70
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,608
There's no supervisors.
You practically run the place.

71
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,680
You like to read.
It's quiet at night.

72
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,784
- It's quiet during the day.
- Good. It's settled.

73
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,081
See you tomorrow night.
You'll be breaking in a new partner.

74
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,587
Bill something or other.

75
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,190
Mr. Carboni?

76
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,556
Who has my job?

77
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,463
Right here.
It's right on here.

78
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,071
He seems to have
the same last name you do.

79
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,377
I think he's my nephew.
I'll see you, Chuck.

80
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,717
Well, that's just wonderful.

81
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,364
What am I supposed to be doing
every night while you're working?

82
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,033
- I'll be home days.
- I work days.

83
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,931
All normal people work days.

84
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,833
Should I have quit?
Want me to go--

85
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,339
Why ask me? I don't know why
you work there in the first place.

86
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,636
Your mother says you're
a financial wizard.

87
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,779
Why do you listen to my mother?
This is the same woman...

88
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,610
...who goes to a séance every
Friday night since my father died...

89
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,343
...just so she can still yell at him.

90
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,664
How long will you be on there?

91
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,424
Until the wedding.

92
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,933
That's nine months.

93
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:14,196
Don't you want me to look good?

94
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,067
I think you look good now.

95
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,002
And I think you're
the sweetest man in the world.

96
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,762
Every day!

97
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,879
You're going the wrong way!

98
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:19,829
You the night guy?

99
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:24,793
How you doing?
I'm Leonard Carboni.

100
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,494
What a pleasure to meet you, Leonard.

101
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,064
- How was your first day?
- Shitty!

102
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,175
- A lot of paperwork.
- I see.

103
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:34,174
Uncle Sal said you'd
straighten it out.

104
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,539
Fine.

105
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:51,282
<i>Jumpin' Jack Flash</i>

106
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,623
How you doing?

107
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,888
I'm Bill Blazejowski.

108
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,430
Call me Billy Blaze.
You must be Chuck.

109
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:03,896
Nice shoes.

110
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,161
This is all right.

111
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:09,829
Guess this is where I'll be working.
I'm your new partner.

112
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,134
Swish! They're going crazy
in the arena!

113
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,210
They can't believe it!
Unbelievable!

114
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,645
Great! What's our job?
Drive around and pick up stiffs?

115
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,680
Is that what we're supposed to do?

116
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:21,978
Who's this? Wife?

117
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,711
Fiancée.

118
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,385
Nice frame.

119
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,556
We can make stuff. We can read.

120
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,786
Coffee. This is great!

121
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,157
I like it.

122
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,990
You want to know why
I carry this tape recorder?

123
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,397
It's to tape things.

124
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,764
See...

125
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,469
...I'm an idea man, Chuck.
All right?

126
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,733
I get ideas all day.
I can't control them.

127
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,605
It's like they come charging in.

128
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,781
I can't even fight them
if I wanted to.

129
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,609
So I say them in here.

130
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,409
That way, I never forget them.

131
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,481
Okay, here's an example.

132
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:57,550
Watch out. Stand back.

133
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,848
This is Bill.

134
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,423
Idea to eliminate garbage.

135
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,456
Edible paper.

136
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,354
Eat it, it's gone.

137
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,000
Eat it, it's out of there.
No garbage.

138
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,000
I got everything in here.
Business ideas, inventions.

139
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,365
I wrote a couple of musicals.

140
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,235
Would you like to see
the rest of the office?

141
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,575
Want a Snickers? It's not frozen,
my refrigerator broke.

142
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,644
I understand.

143
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,483
Where you from?
I'm from Cleveland.

144
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,743
I'm originally from Seattle.

145
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,183
- And this is our lab.
- Yeah, it's nice.

146
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,380
Get this.
I'm living with this chick.

147
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,286
I come home,
I catch her in bed...

148
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,551
...with another girl.

149
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,592
I went, "No!"
I couldn't believe it!

150
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,492
She went lesbo on me, like that.
Unbelievable!

151
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,668
I just finished my dinner.
I walked right out of there.

152
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,667
- What do you think? Was that wrong?
- That's very personal--

153
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,669
What's in here?
Just stiffs and stuff?

154
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,273
No, we call them corpses.

155
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,102
- Can I take a peek?
- Sure.

156
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,140
I think there's one--

157
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,245
This Carboni guy.
Is he our boss?

158
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,382
He's the supervisor.
He's not here at night.

159
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,643
Get out of town!
Just you, me and the stiffs alone?

160
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,821
That's going to be radical!

161
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,751
That guy's dead.

162
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,900
Charlotte?

163
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:21,435
You've been in there half an hour.
You okay?

164
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,731
I'm fat.

165
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,373
You're not fat.

166
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,905
I'm fat!

167
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,039
This is my one night off.

168
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:31,681
I look forward to this all week.

169
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,248
Why don't you come to bed?

170
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:36,078
I just want to lose six more pounds.

171
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,120
Tonight?

172
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:43,620
Why don't you run into bed?
Maybe you'll lose pounds along the way.

173
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,859
All right, Chuck.
Just don't look at me.

174
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,860
Are the lights out?

175
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,796
Are the lights out?

176
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,544
Could you close the drapes?

177
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:08,476
Sure.

178
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,217
Could you just check
the apartment?

179
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,254
Why do I have to check
the apartment every time?

180
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:24,629
Would you, please? If you check
the apartment, then I can relax.

181
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,045
Nobody here.

182
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,901
Are you excited?

183
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,669
Like the French when Lindbergh landed.

184
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,412
Am I fat?

185
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,337
Am I fat?

186
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,710
You're a willow.

187
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,044
You're a reed.

188
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:16,117
You're Audrey Hepburn.

189
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:24,820
You're not fat.

190
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,019
That music.

191
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,198
What music?

192
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,263
That music.

193
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,093
What music?

194
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,570
It's just a little loud music.

195
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,708
Well, it bothers me.

196
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,937
You let too many things bother you.

197
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,877
That way you'll never
have an orgas--

198
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,044
Don't you say that word!

199
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,743
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,748
I'm sorry.

201
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,443
Who the hell is that?

202
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,744
Did you knock on that door?

203
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:24,153
Well?

204
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,086
Mistake.
It's a very big mistake.

205
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,884
Luke, who is it?

206
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,755
Some dwarf.

207
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,459
Thank you.

208
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,128
What's taking so long?
Will he stop playing that awful music?

209
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:40,202
- We were just getting to that--
- What's she mean, "awful music"?

210
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,540
Awful good.
She meant awful good.

211
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:49,140
Why don't you go back inside?
I'll be right in.

212
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,047
Go play with your rope.

213
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:55,310
Don't be long, now.

214
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,084
Sorry.
We'll keep it down, okay?

215
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,485
I knew I recognized you!

216
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,355
Last week, at the morgue.

217
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,325
I knew I recognized you.

218
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,659
I'd probably seen you
in the building when I moved in.

219
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:11,065
You live here?

220
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,197
But don't worry.

221
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,238
Luke is leaving town
with the rodeo, and I...

222
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,102
...hardly ever do business up here.

223
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,238
What kind of business are they doing?

224
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:23,805
She sells cowboy hats.

225
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,414
The man was in his underwear.

226
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,943
And cowboy underwear.

227
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,020
Belinda! Come on, darling.
Haul it in here, now.

228
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:32,587
I'll be right in.

229
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,019
I've got to go.

230
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,249
We'll keep it down.

231
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,252
See you around, neighbor.

232
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,323
I took care of that.
Let's go back inside.

233
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,026
I think I should go home.

234
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,929
Why? They said they'll keep it down.

235
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,295
When did you get dressed?

236
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:50,372
It wasn't going to be any good
tonight anyway. I feel so guilty!

237
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,573
I cheated today.

238
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,978
- You're kidding.
- I had a Nestle's Crunch bar.

239
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,711
Food.

240
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,177
I feel like dirt.
I am really sorry.

241
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,652
No one else would be
this patient with me.

242
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,052
I'll see you next Sunday.

243
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,382
Food came.

244
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:35,950
You owe me three dollars.

245
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,685
I'm really getting good
at remembering these cards.

246
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:41,920
Twenty-one.

247
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,352
Boy, I tell you...

248
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:46,587
...this weekend is it.

249
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,800
This weekend,
I go to Atlantic City...

250
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,902
...and I do nothing but play blackjack
straight through.

251
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:56,073
I won't even get a room,
I'll just get those Wash 'N Drys.

252
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,970
You know? Did I tell you
I thought of them first?

253
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,872
Only they already had them.

254
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,738
Twenty-one.
What's the matter?

255
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,246
I ordered egg salad
and they sent me tuna fish.

256
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,887
They always send the wrong food.
Send it back, get what you want.

257
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,953
They get angry if you complain.

258
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:13,089
It's all right.

259
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,259
The chef has a lot on his mind.

260
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,119
Like what? Curing cancer?

261
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,328
Wait a minute.

262
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,166
Hold the phone.

263
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,268
I got it!

264
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,462
Oh, you're going to cure cancer.

265
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,669
Tuna fish.

266
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,932
What if you mix...

267
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:35,271
...mayonnaise in the can
with the tuna?

268
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,310
Hold it!

269
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:38,414
Hold it! Wait a minute!

270
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,551
Take live tuna fish...

271
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,721
...and feed them mayonnaise.

272
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,854
This is good.

273
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,284
Call StarKist.

274
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,624
This is great!

275
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,125
<i>Wall Street Journal</i>?
Why not the <i>Enquirer</i>?

276
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,559
It interests me.
I was an investment counselor.

277
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,027
No kidding?

278
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,130
What's that?

279
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,596
It's like a stockbroker.

280
00:23:57,802 --> 00:24:00,396
So what are you doing
babysitting stiffs?

281
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,402
You're a drinker, big drinker?

282
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,604
Toothead. Doper.
Nose candy. Coke.

283
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:10,912
Come on.

284
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,707
It was a very rough job!

285
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,580
I'd shape up a deal over two months,
another man...

286
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,881
...would come in
and take all the credit.

287
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,857
I just needed a place that was quiet.
I'm in a transitional period.

288
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,997
What kind of paper is this?
No sports, no comics, no Ann Landers.

289
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,497
Can I help you?

290
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,465
Yes, I'm looking
for a Mr. Blazejowski.

291
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,702
I'm Jefferey Durkin.

292
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,171
You sure are.

293
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,537
How you doing, Jeff?

294
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,543
You got money for me?
Some cash? Some do-re-mi?

295
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,215
- 20 bucks, right?
- 20 bucks. Thanks.

296
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,544
Wait outside while
I'm getting the car.

297
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:50,516
- Sure.
- All right, there you go.

298
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,848
Nice tux!

299
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,216
Good fit!

300
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,587
I don't want to be a buttinksy,
but what exactly is going on?

301
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:03,563
Some kind of debutante ball.
Kid wants me to take him and his girl.

302
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,702
You're taking one of
the morgue vehicles?

303
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,566
It's a limo, ain't it?
It's a limo for dead people.

304
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,331
Did you see that kid?

305
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,608
Wait. Are you telling me...

306
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,176
...that every night you leave,
this is what you do?

307
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,211
There isn't a debutante ball
every night.

308
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,975
I do weddings, bar mitzvahs
or just cruise the airport.

309
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,153
I picked up these Japanese guys.

310
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,514
$400 from the airport to the U.N.

311
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:26,417
You're ripping off diplomats!

312
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:27,454
Here.

313
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,887
It's $100.

314
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,321
What is this for?

315
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,496
Okay, big-time, let's roll!

316
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,187
Rock and roll!

317
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,910
What happens if we get a call?

318
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:53,709
If you have to go
and pick up a body or....

319
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:56,083
I'll be back.

320
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,157
By the time I get there,
they won't be dead anymore?

321
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,119
Hey, kid.
Do you like music?

322
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,819
- Sure!
- Good.

323
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,934
<i>Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas-gas-gas</i>

324
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:46,131
<i>Okay, Hoppy, lead the way.</i>

325
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,572
<i>Oh, Pebbles! Daddy's home!</i>

326
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,977
Good evening, Leonard.

327
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,619
Hi, Mr. Lumley.

328
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,846
Boy, that Barney Rubble.

329
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,319
What an actor!

330
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,858
We got some bodies in the wrong drawers.
But Uncle Sal said--

331
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,495
I'd straighten it out.

332
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,721
Good night, Mr. Lumley.

333
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:16,661
<i>Flintstones, meet them Flintstones</i>

334
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,268
<i>They're the modern Stone Age family</i>

335
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,413
"Name of the deceased."

336
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,613
"Something Polish"?

337
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:45,055
I just saw jerky Leonard.
Why don't we have TV?

338
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,992
Want to hear about my weekend?

339
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:49,461
I've been working
on my blackjack system.

340
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,334
All right. So.

341
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,969
I go down to Atlantic City...

342
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,401
...and I'm in the casino
with my Wash 'N Drys.

343
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,699
Did I tell you I had
the idea for them first?

344
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,901
Anyway, I'm sitting there
and I'm playing blackjack, right?

345
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,602
They bar me.

346
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,248
They bar me!

347
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,713
I'm out! I'm barred!
I can't get in now.

348
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,751
Right? You know why?
Being too good a player.

349
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,546
How much did you win?

350
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:13,919
I was down a couple hundred.

351
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,956
But they could tell I was good.

352
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,651
They looked at me and threw me out.
They bar me.

353
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,388
So they deal me off the bottom.
I can tell.

354
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,261
So I yell at the dealer.
He goes to the pit boss.

355
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:28,132
So I throw my complimentary
watered-down drink in his fat face!

356
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,200
So they barred me
for being too good a player.

357
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:35,008
Think I'll go to Vegas next week.

358
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,477
I wish you would shut up.

359
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,445
Vegas knows how to treat you right.

360
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,845
Because you got broads
and Wayne Newton.

361
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,577
He's an Indian, did you know?

362
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,949
- I'll introduce you--
- Do me a favor?

363
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,784
Would you please shut up?

364
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:51,186
You telling me to shut up?

365
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,762
I'm telling you to shut up!

366
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,025
I will tell your recorder
so that you don't forget.

367
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,194
Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!

368
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,941
This used to be a quiet place
before you came.

369
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,134
You talk too much!

370
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,803
Edible paper?
Feeding mayonnaise to tuna fish?

371
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,348
I will give you a quarter
if you just stop talking!

372
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,045
Thank you.

373
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:40,037
I thought we were friends.

374
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:56,592
<i>Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!</i>

375
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:01,797
<i>Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!</i>

376
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:07,033
<i>Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!</i>

377
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,300
<i>--Bill to shut up!</i>

378
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,580
Sorry that I yelled at you.

379
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:29,250
You think it's been easy on me?

380
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,123
I come in here,
I'm the new guy with no friends.

381
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,856
I confide in you my whole life!

382
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,365
I tell you my deepest,
most intimate stuff.

383
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,469
You share anything with me?

384
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,976
I see a picture
of your fiancée everyday.

385
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,304
You don't even tell me her name.

386
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:51,707
I gave you $100.

387
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:52,940
I didn't ask for it.

388
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,641
That's what made it such
a beautiful gesture.

389
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,343
Never mind. Forget it.

390
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:01,286
We'll work together every night
like strangers. That's fine with me.

391
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,238
Charlotte.

392
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,701
What?

393
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:23,439
My fiancée's name is Charlotte.

394
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:06,721
Oh, my God!

395
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,262
Did you fall down?
Did somebody hit you?

396
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,162
It's the other way around.
Somebody hit me and then I fell down.

397
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,200
I wish I had my handkerchief.

398
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,099
I've got tissue in my purse.

399
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:23,466
Let me do it.

400
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,709
Do you have a handkerchief?

401
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:30,744
Mugger!

402
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,313
I need your handkerchief.

403
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,202
Thank you.

404
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:02,476
This was the first time I was
ever beaten up by a bunch of Bluebells.

405
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,272
I didn't like it.

406
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:05,949
How are you?

407
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,485
I'm great.

408
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,245
Four pounds of makeup,
they'll never know the difference.

409
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:13,787
Can I ask you a question?

410
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,719
I wouldn't do it with a guy
until he paid me.

411
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,063
So, he beat me up.

412
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:24,058
That's what happens
without a pimp.

413
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,031
Some guys figure,
why should they pay?

414
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,797
That guy in the morgue.
He was your pimp, right?

415
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,439
A lot of Franklin's ladies
are in the same boat.

416
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,770
We could find another pimp...

417
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,245
...but some of those guys
are real rough.

418
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,943
Get the girls hooked on dope.

419
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:45,085
Drugs or beat-up.
It's a nice choice.

420
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:48,217
You could do something different.
You're very bright.

421
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,753
Is your head okay?

422
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,489
Because I'm real tired.

423
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,661
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.
Thank you.

424
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,294
Thanks very much.

425
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,338
I hope everything turns out all right.

426
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,168
See you in the halls.

427
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,168
She was just lying there
in the elevator?

428
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:41,310
She was all beat-up.

429
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:43,109
That's why they have pimps.

430
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,008
That's what she said.

431
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:48,674
She knows a bunch
of girls that need pimps.

432
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,116
I really hope they find
someone trustworthy.

433
00:34:52,823 --> 00:34:54,188
Are you crazy?

434
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:55,983
Those guys are killers.

435
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:57,717
They're animals.

436
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,825
They dress nice, though.

437
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,567
Wait a minute.

438
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,896
Hold the phone, Chuck.

439
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:09,436
We got all that space
down at the morgue.

440
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,406
All those cars. All that time at night.
Nobody watching us.

441
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,569
We could handle things
for your neighbor...

442
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,839
...and her friends,
right out of the morgue!

443
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,176
Pimps?

444
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,580
Are you saying we should become pimps?

445
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,947
Pimps is an ugly word.

446
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:28,154
We'll call us Love Brokers.

447
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:30,651
This is my stop.
You think about it.

448
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:34,092
I really think this is the one.
I am excited about this. I mean it.

449
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,822
This is it, I think.

450
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,432
Love Brokers.

451
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,368
Love Brokers!

452
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,536
You and me, buddy!

453
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,710
You're over the rainbow, pal.

454
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,907
Love Brokers.

455
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,985
Last week when you helped me...

456
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,484
...I got a little rude before you left.

457
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,157
Oh, no, you didn't.

458
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,019
Well, anyway....

459
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,162
We come home from work
at the same time each day.

460
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,361
I thought maybe we might
start having breakfast together.

461
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:45,936
You got any eggs?

462
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,897
I practically have
a whole dairy in here.

463
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,232
Great!

464
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,804
Your place is beautiful!

465
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,607
And it's warm!
My place is freezing.

466
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,647
And you got a kitchen.

467
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:01,909
And you got eggs.

468
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,609
How do you like your eggs?

469
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,379
- Scrambled.
- Of course.

470
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,784
Men love scrambled.

471
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:08,981
I didn't know that.

472
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,058
Men love scrambled.

473
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,527
Does the window open?

474
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,841
No, I'm real sorry.
It's painted shut.

475
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,239
Makes sense, doesn't it?
That's where the fire escape is.

476
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,310
Is there a vent or a fan or anything?

477
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,610
Sorry, that room catches
all the heat in the morning.

478
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,317
It's okay.

479
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,189
Well, you know...

480
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,659
...it's worse in the summer.

481
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:52,326
My God!

482
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:54,226
I'll put my robe back on.

483
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,972
No, no, don't!

484
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,235
What I mean is...

485
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,877
...that you should be comfortable.

486
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,478
I am.

487
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,611
I'll get that.

488
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,651
It's probably for me.

489
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,760
Why'd you call?

490
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,096
What's the matter?

491
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,467
You ate what?

492
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,193
That's okay.
Just don't do it again.

493
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,036
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm not doing anything.

494
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:34,241
Of course I sound strange
if you call me...

495
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,881
...and you say what am I doing,
and I'm not doing anything!

496
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,976
Oh, my God.

497
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,582
I just stepped on a tack.

498
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,680
I love you too.

499
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,152
Eggs coming right up.

500
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,427
I was thinking about
the last time that we were together.

501
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,221
And I was wondering...

502
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,198
...have you been able to find a....

503
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,868
A pimp?

504
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,501
I have to, though.

505
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,863
This way's too dangerous.

506
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:05,974
Lupe, she's my friend.

507
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,845
She got her arm broke last week.

508
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:12,040
What a sick world!

509
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,807
Yeah. Thank God.

510
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:21,314
We could do this every morning.

511
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,091
At least until
you get tired of eggs.

512
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,132
Boy, it is hot in here.

513
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:36,703
You got any bread?

514
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:39,704
I must have left my money at home.

515
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,537
It's in my other pants, I think.

516
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:42,973
There you go.

517
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,239
$4.90 out of $5?
Keep the dime.

518
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,280
That's all right.
I'll take these.

519
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,519
They gave me the wrong bread.

520
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,386
- I asked for wheat, I got white.
- Send it back.

521
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:58,788
- You gave him white bread.
- Don't make a fuss.

522
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,794
My mother said, you send it back,
the chef spits on it.

523
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,933
Turkeys!
Come and get your turkeys.

524
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,568
Immoral?

525
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,328
What do you mean, immoral?

526
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,167
As a matter of fact,
prostitution is probably...

527
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,900
...one of the most
moral things in the world.

528
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,240
How'd you figure that out?

529
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,381
Simple. You take a guy.

530
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,914
He's in from out of town.
Let's say that guy.

531
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,949
He's in from out of town.
He's here on business.

532
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,417
He's away from his wife
and 2.3 children.

533
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:30,585
He's got urges. Let's say he
goes in to see this picture.

534
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:32,489
Which, by the way,
is not a bad movie.

535
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,459
Anyway, let's say this picture...

536
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,757
...stimulates his....

537
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:36,796
Urges.

538
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,563
Good word.

539
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,397
Now he's out on the
street again, right?

540
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,469
He is a loaded pistol!
He's like Mount St. Helens.

541
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:45,539
Who walks by...

542
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,903
...but a Girl Scout
swinging her cookies?

543
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,012
Girl Scouts of America.
He goes bananas.

544
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,772
He's on her like mud on a pig.

545
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,951
That wouldn't have happened if
he'd gone to a hooker, right?

546
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,950
So you call that moral?
He goes and jumps on a Girl Scout...

547
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,783
...and breaks her cookies
and you call that moral?

548
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:05,452
You figured that all out
just by yourself?

549
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,256
- I have that kind of mind.
- Yes, you do.

550
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,632
So let's do it!

551
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,537
Okay, now?

552
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,240
Yeah, nice.

553
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,137
But isn't this a little high, Angelo?

554
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,039
That's the way I always do it.

555
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,270
You like it that way.

556
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,708
I do?

557
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,542
All right, I do.

558
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:28,351
How you doing?

559
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,780
You getting a haircut?

560
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,319
No, I just like wearing sheets.

561
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,185
Look at this. Did I tell you?
"Girl Scout Attacked!"

562
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,381
In the paper.

563
00:41:36,593 --> 00:41:37,855
Could I see that again?

564
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,120
Right there.
"Girl Scout Attacked!"

565
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,122
"Girl Scout Attacked By Dog."

566
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,494
Dog. Guy from out of town.
What's the difference?

567
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:46,760
There's a difference.

568
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,530
One carries an attaché case.
The other urinates on a tree.

569
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,834
What are you doing? What is this?
A haircut? You call that--

570
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,271
Even these sideburns out!

571
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,242
The man has a razor in his hand.
Let us not get him angry.

572
00:41:57,447 --> 00:41:59,574
One sideburn's up here.
The other's in Fort Lauderdale.

573
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,683
He is a seasoned professional.

574
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,186
Do you want Belinda
working for one of those animals?

575
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,755
You want her to be
Miss Heroin 1982?

576
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,786
Charlotte's parents are
coming in for Thanksgiving.

577
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:13,087
I really need to get this haircut.

578
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,629
That's it, get the haircut!

579
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,359
Get all your hair cut.

580
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:24,937
You only think about yourself.
You don't care what happens to me!

581
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,734
Or what happens to Belinda!

582
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:30,277
You don't care about what happens to
the Girl Scouts of America!

583
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,246
I'm fed up, man!

584
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,314
I'm fed up with you!

585
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,845
I wash my hands
and my feet of you!

586
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,217
Trim that!

587
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,261
Mr. and Mrs. Koogle,
would you like a drink?

588
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,401
Mrs. Koogle and I do not drink.

589
00:42:53,036 --> 00:42:54,264
Of course.

590
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,235
So how do you like
our fair city?

591
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,968
We don't.

592
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,610
Perhaps if you drank you would.

593
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,080
Mom, is dinner almost ready?

594
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,447
Turkey's almost dead.

595
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,431
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving.

596
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,626
- Arrested?
- I'm really sorry.

597
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,271
I called the landlady
and she wasn't home.

598
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:35,276
They're taking me to night court.
My ID and money are in my apartment.

599
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,015
This is not a good evening.

600
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,708
My entire family
is here for Thanksgiving.

601
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,216
Please!

602
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,946
Franklin used to take
care of all these things.

603
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,920
I don't know what they're
going to do to me.

604
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:51,894
Don't cry.

605
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,596
I'll be there as soon as
I can get there.

606
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,129
Thanks.

607
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,766
Thanks a lot.

608
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:02,833
Have you seen the lights on at night?

609
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,804
No wonder this city's going broke!

610
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:11,040
I have to go out and I'll be back
in a minute, okay?

611
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,512
What? Where are you going?

612
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:28,687
You didn't have to come with me.
I would've been home in 10 minutes.

613
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,561
We paid for the rental car,
might as well use it.

614
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:33,292
You want to excuse me, sonny?

615
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,596
I want to know why she called you.

616
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,933
She's my neighbor.

617
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:39,574
Excuse me.

618
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,177
The district attorney has
no objections...

619
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,575
...so if you like,
I think we can proceed.

620
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:47,010
Next case.

621
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:53,989
That's his neighbor.

622
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,665
Belinda Keaton, you're charged
with prostitution and assault.

623
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,563
Not guilty, your honor.

624
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,260
- Not guilty?
- Not guilty!

625
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,599
Not guilty!
Your honor, this woman is a menace!

626
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:13,469
You are one Howard Pelekoudas?

627
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,268
Yes, sir.
I'm the victim.

628
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,946
You're an asshole!

629
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,047
Be that as it may...

630
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,344
...can we proceed?

631
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,581
Mr. Pelekoudas and I
had just completed...

632
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,587
...a business transaction.

633
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:33,392
At which point, Mr.Pelekoudas
attempted to forcibly exact a refund...

634
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,225
...when services had
already been rendered.

635
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,798
He tried to grab
his money back?

636
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,461
Yes! That's when she assaulted me.

637
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:42,972
You look unmarked...

638
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,073
...undamaged to me in any manner.

639
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,674
Oh, yeah?

640
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:52,444
Feast your eyes on this!

641
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:54,847
Exhibit "A"!

642
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,150
She bit me!

643
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,752
What about my feelings?

644
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,833
You want to know what
really steams my bean?

645
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,602
They let that strumpet
right back out on the street.

646
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,704
You're moving out of that building.

647
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:17,635
Why are you friends with that girl?

648
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:18,773
She's my neighbor!

649
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:20,499
She happens to be a very nice girl.

650
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:21,699
She's a harlot.

651
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,210
- Wait a minute--
- You stay out of it!

652
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,348
Let me tell you,
when you get married...

653
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,815
...you'll have to handle him
just the way I handled his father.

654
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,618
Damn potholes!

655
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,381
You all right, Rose?

656
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,321
If not for me, his father
would've done as he pleased.

657
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,757
You know what he wanted to do?
Make furniture.

658
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,555
By hand!

659
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,365
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Koogle.
I straightened out Al...

660
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,162
...and together we'll all
straighten out Chuck.

661
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,506
You all right, Rose?

662
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:17,797
Hey! My bud!

663
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,832
I have to talk to you.
It's important.

664
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:21,401
Come on in.

665
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,571
How'd you get in?

666
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:25,104
This is a security building.

667
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:27,401
I'm going to have to
talk to that guy.

668
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,740
Way to go!

669
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,384
What are we really
talking about here?

670
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,059
What's the essence...

671
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,290
...of what we're talking about?

672
00:47:46,062 --> 00:47:48,360
I'll spell it out for you
if I have to.

673
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,233
Prostitution!

674
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:58,939
Cut it out!

675
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,506
What is this?

676
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,944
Prostitution.

677
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,438
We can say it.

678
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,309
We're big kids now, right?

679
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:09,417
Sometimes it helps you understand
a word if you break it down.

680
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:11,610
So let's do that now.
Shall we?

681
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,186
PROS--

682
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,358
Doesn't mean anything.
Forget about that.

683
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:18,055
TIT. I think we all know
what that means.

684
00:48:18,261 --> 00:48:20,286
TU-- Okay, TU.

685
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:21,928
And --TION, of course...

686
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:23,961
...from the Latin...

687
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,696
..."to shun."

688
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,761
To say, "No thank you, anyway.
I don't want it."

689
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,372
"To push away."

690
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:34,940
Doesn't even belong here.
Let's get rid of it.

691
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,578
You know...

692
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,948
...if I can take a moment here...

693
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,277
...and I mean this...

694
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:44,612
...what I'm about to say.

695
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,786
I feel a lot of love
in this room.

696
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:52,461
Maybe it's me, but I tell you,
it was here a minute ago.

697
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:54,994
And it was really beautiful.

698
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:58,463
So at this moment it's important
that I see all of your breasts.

699
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:01,763
Or I don't have to see your breasts.

700
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,964
Let's get out of here.
This guy's no pimp. He's a wimp!

701
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,234
Come on, you guys!
Give him a chance.

702
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,272
Is this a joke?

703
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,073
You're missing <i>The Donahue Show.</i>
I had you on the show.

704
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,146
Booked!

705
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,345
You've got to tell them.
Just tell them like you told me.

706
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,180
Get out of here.

707
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,287
Let's go.
We wasted enough time.

708
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:27,029
How would you ladies like to earn
10 times what you earn now?

709
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:30,527
I'm not kidding.

710
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,495
Ten times the amount of money
that you earn right now.

711
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,767
You want to use the blackboard?

712
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,078
You know, you're absolutely right.

713
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,070
We're not pimps.

714
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,815
If I understand it correctly...

715
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,385
...pimps make 70...

716
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,488
...80, 90 percent...

717
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:54,714
...of your money, right?

718
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,317
You work very hard for
that money, don't you?

719
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:01,729
Then please think of
William and myself...

720
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:03,193
...as business managers.

721
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,994
As agents, if you will.
We're only interested...

722
00:50:06,202 --> 00:50:08,136
...in 10 percent of your money.

723
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:09,201
Ten percent?

724
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,237
Leave him alone. He's doing fine.

725
00:50:13,943 --> 00:50:15,877
And ladies, I have a knack.

726
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,604
I can take money and I can
make it into more money.

727
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,305
- Oh, boy!
- More money?

728
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,418
Why shouldn't you have
the fruits of your labor?

729
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,553
Why should you be cheated and beaten?

730
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,491
Do you have a dental plan?

731
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,388
Do you have a health plan?

732
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:34,859
If you come with us, we'd like
to give you a sound foundation.

733
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,896
A financial foundation.

734
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,432
And if you don't come with us,
I understand.

735
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,536
Thank you very much for listening.

736
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,433
No! Wait a minute.

737
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,236
That was great!

738
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,210
What do you think?
You think this guy's legit?

739
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:55,216
Wait, these guys are snowing us!
You know that.

740
00:50:55,418 --> 00:50:57,215
This is too easy.

741
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,050
You should've pushed a little more.

742
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:02,952
I did the best I could.

743
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,621
Okay, are we going to do this?

744
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,927
We're all yours!

745
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,033
You pushed just enough.
You--

746
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,261
Right up to it and then you laid back.
That's perfect.

747
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,841
We'll get to have
them all too, sexually.

748
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:04,404
How you doing? I am cooking like
Betty Crocker tonight!

749
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:05,505
I get any calls?

750
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,878
Lupe called.
She's finished with Mr. Culpepper.

751
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,874
She's now with Mr. Jergens.

752
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,674
Marlene just called.

753
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,478
She has a date with a young man.
She wants you to take her.

754
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,014
Good. I got a couple of minutes.

755
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:22,716
What are you doing?

756
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,427
We don't want our girls getting
beaten up by any of those bozos.

757
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,824
So if we run into them,
they'll see muscles.

758
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,557
- And these are them?
- Yeah. It's working, right?

759
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,360
Business is going great.

760
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:34,866
I suppose so.

761
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:36,568
So what's wrong?

762
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,740
Ever since we started this,
I have been ill.

763
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:41,610
I have headaches...

764
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,075
...stomachaches.
I get the chills.

765
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,641
My gums are bleeding.

766
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,316
And my hair keeps falling out
into the sink.

767
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,483
So?

768
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,687
Let me try to explain this to you.

769
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,215
As we sit here and idly chat...

770
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,484
...there are women...

771
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,252
...female human beings...

772
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,625
...rolling around in strange beds
with strange men...

773
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,232
...and we are making money from that.

774
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,628
Is this a great country or what?

775
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,102
Look at this.

776
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,838
This is hair.

777
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:15,772
This is hair that used to be
in my head. See?

778
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,504
The same thing happened when
I worked on Wall Street.

779
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,774
I had to wear a hat,
sitting at my desk.

780
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,147
This is Bill. Mission in life:

781
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:26,515
Make Chuck a man!

782
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:29,849
What am I now, a duck?

783
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,851
You're unbelievable.

784
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:35,053
You are something else, pal.

785
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,691
You are some kind of guy.

786
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,807
Impress the girls.

787
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,172
Corn dog.

788
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:56,982
Bill, I'm back!

789
00:56:08,564 --> 00:56:09,531
William.

790
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:33,020
New guy!

791
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:43,562
Help!

792
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:00,312
New record!

793
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,477
I got it!

794
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:13,285
I could have done it!

795
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:14,326
He called me!

796
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,430
Now you've gone over the line!

797
00:57:16,632 --> 00:57:18,827
Hold on a minute.
Get the chug-party goodies!

798
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:20,135
Go home!

799
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:21,166
Go home!

800
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:25,636
Remember that kid I took to the party?
This is his fraternity.

801
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,241
So what?

802
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,268
He's the greatest!

803
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:32,881
They can't have girls in the dorm.
So I brought them here, group rate.

804
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,379
They let me in the fraternity.

805
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,848
You've got to ask them to get out!
Please!

806
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,020
My brothers?!

807
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:42,021
- What's wrong with you?!
- Carboni will fire me! That's what!

808
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,590
It's college high jinks!

809
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,782
It's not high jinks.

810
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:48,157
Remember the pain in my gums and hair?
It's moved to my chest.

811
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,355
A young man shouldn't have
pains in his chest!

812
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,261
You got to learn how to live!
How to have fun! How to be a man!

813
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,664
Radical!

814
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,339
Let's get radical!

815
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,236
Come on, what the...?

816
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,346
Bummer! I am bummed right out!

817
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,209
Get out of here!

818
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,115
That's better.

819
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:18,623
I don't know about you people.

820
00:58:19,428 --> 00:58:20,452
This is a morgue.

821
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:23,291
You're partying in a morgue.

822
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,128
You don't believe me?

823
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:27,859
Let's go take a look at
rigor mortis in room 12.

824
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:30,999
This'll bring you back to reality.

825
00:58:31,607 --> 00:58:33,472
I want you all to see this.

826
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,839
So that's what it's like!

827
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,211
Jefferey pulled one down!

828
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:57,531
That very moment they all
jumped in the drawers.

829
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:58,700
Yeah, I heard.

830
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:00,994
You're not shocked by that?

831
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,972
How could people do it
in a morgue?

832
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:07,233
How could people do it
in the drawers?

833
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,570
- It's new.
- It's sick!

834
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,012
Everybody's looking for
a new way to do it.

835
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,310
A guy once took me up
in a helicopter.

836
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,246
Had me do it...

837
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,386
...with him...

838
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,319
...as we hovered over
his ex-wife's house.

839
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,897
Don't you ever fantasize different
ways you want to do it?

840
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:35,259
Once I'd like to do it
without checking the apartment first.

841
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,763
What?

842
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:38,430
Nothing.

843
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,990
- This is nice, huh?
- Nice.

844
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,091
Practically drives itself.

845
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,170
Can you turn down the music?

846
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,471
Can you turn the music down?

847
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,506
I can turn it down.
I can turn it up.

848
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:17,975
I can switch it from
the back to the front.

849
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,513
- I can make it reverberate. I--
- Can you turn it down?

850
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,186
Thank you.

851
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,719
Look at this dash.
Solid gold.

852
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:28,983
Look at this carpeting.
Fur.

853
01:00:29,191 --> 01:00:31,091
- Check out these windows!
- Glass?

854
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,556
Glass. Yeah.

855
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,128
But we can see out
and nobody can see in.

856
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,465
Watch.

857
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,700
Watch, okay? Here we go.

858
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,098
Hey, you! Right here!

859
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,532
Right here, buddy!

860
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,072
Look at this!

861
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:51,034
We got teenage girls!
The place is full of broads in here!

862
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:57,980
Go! Roger!

863
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,484
Roger, officer!

864
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,122
Is this great or what?

865
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,520
You ought to get one, man.
This is great.

866
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,355
Everything's automatic too.

867
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,359
You can pop the trunk from here.
Don't have to move.

868
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:17,595
You should get one. What do you do
with all your money, anyway?

869
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:18,899
You know...

870
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:21,743
...I'd like to talk to you about that.

871
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,239
I have this feeling
something's very wrong.

872
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,312
We're this close from
getting caught.

873
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:29,048
Know what? It's my fault
you're the way you are.

874
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:32,982
I promised I'd show you around
and I haven't. It's my fault.

875
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,121
Listen.

876
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:37,315
Today it starts, all right?
Operation Chuck.

877
01:01:37,526 --> 01:01:39,517
From now on we'll have some
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

878
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:42,197
<i>Till her daddy takes her T-Bird away</i>
All right?

879
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,026
When I'm done with you,
you'll be a walking Mardi Gras.

880
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:49,534
I won't even be able to control you.
You'll be an insane cowboy.

881
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,432
Come on, ladies.

882
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,271
Chuckie, dollface...

883
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,949
...I don't have to eat in dives
like this no more!

884
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,853
Come on, don't be snobs.

885
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,320
I used to be the pickle girl
here once.

886
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,585
Lupe used to be the pickle girl.

887
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:14,524
Lupe, you now own the pickles!

888
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,425
Say what?

889
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,795
Ladies, I'm pleased to announce
to each and everyone of you...

890
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,369
...that you are the proud owner
of this particular Burger Steak.

891
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,442
Remember, sign the contracts.

892
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,199
Sign them!

893
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:34,476
This is wonderful.

894
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:37,683
Thank you.

895
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,055
Somebody's taken over
Franklin's business...

896
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,996
...and we're not seeing
a damn dime of it.

897
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,929
All right!
Let me see if I can....

898
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:58,339
Can't you see we're talking?

899
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:02,500
We know Franklin's girls. We'll find
out who's running their action.

900
01:03:02,711 --> 01:03:06,203
Then we'll bury him and put in
our own man, okay?

901
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:08,274
This guy's had enough.

902
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,954
And next time watch out
whose car you sit on!

903
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:20,058
Hi, you guys!
Come on over by the Christmas tree.

904
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:23,725
Come on.

905
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,404
Misters Chuckie and Bill...

906
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,732
...we have something to say to you...

907
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,432
...so I have been elected
the spokesperson.

908
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,816
<i>You take us off the city streets...</i>

909
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:45,213
<i>...and give us nicer mens to meets</i>

910
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:49,254
<i>We have furs and jewels
and nicer dresses to wear</i>

911
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:53,125
<i>And we even go to Vidal Sassoon's
to fix up our hair</i>

912
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,156
<i>We move to nice apartment houses...</i>

913
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:02,098
<i>...instead of living
with the </i>ratones<i> and the mouses</i>

914
01:04:02,304 --> 01:04:03,202
<i>Because of you...</i>

915
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:05,270
<i>...our joy is jumping</i>

916
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,907
<i>Because we at this party...</i>

917
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:08,474
<i>...instead of humping</i>

918
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,012
Check this out, Jack!

919
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,185
Radical!

920
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:27,025
A new tape recorder!

921
01:04:27,796 --> 01:04:29,991
I was going to get one.
But this one's better...

922
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,689
...because I didn't
have to pay for it.

923
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,031
Okay, Chuck, you're next.

924
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,028
I love presents.

925
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,239
Ladies, it's amazing.

926
01:04:44,446 --> 01:04:47,574
You've hit upon the one thing
I've always wanted.

927
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,155
Wear it, baby.

928
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:13,367
Okay, there you go, Joe.

929
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,942
Okay, Pete, here's some wine.

930
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:18,770
So...

931
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,846
...my father told me...

932
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,142
...that I'd never amount
to anything, right?

933
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,644
Fathers get that way.

934
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,453
Yeah, well, he told me that
when I was four.

935
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,860
I'm serious. I know.

936
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,992
Then when I was 13...

937
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:35,427
...he left.

938
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:38,156
He's out of there. He's gone.
History. Right?

939
01:05:39,668 --> 01:05:42,603
Told me and my mom we were
too ugly to look at.

940
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,136
In my case, he was wrong.

941
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,839
No, I mean, my mom....

942
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,403
My mom used to be real pretty.

943
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,654
You live with a lunatic
and it does things to you.

944
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,359
This is Bill.

945
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,362
Call your mom,
wish her a Merry Christmas.

946
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:23,972
This guy...

947
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,045
...doesn't have fun.

948
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:30,378
I'm going to teach this wild man
how to have fun right now.

949
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:34,318
We making loads of cash.
He doesn't spend any of his money.

950
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:36,457
I spent some.

951
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:37,726
On what?

952
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,588
Are you really interested
to see what I spent it on?

953
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,411
<i>And a partridge in a pear tree</i>

954
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:04,750
Are we getting out here?

955
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:06,853
Oh, wait! Wait!

956
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,318
Come on.

957
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:11,618
What is--

958
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,455
- This is what you bought?
- Chuck, wait!

959
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,222
A cemetery.

960
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,791
Wait a minute, will you?

961
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:21,833
You know what?

962
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:24,005
This might not be a bad idea.

963
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:25,935
Because you know...

964
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,634
...people got to die, right?

965
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,869
Why can't they just die for us?

966
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:34,905
We just sit back and rake it in.
Chuck and Bill's Cemetery.

967
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,913
This one's full.

968
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,215
Should've bought an empty one.

969
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,686
You wanted to see what I bought.

970
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:57,536
Your father?

971
01:07:58,273 --> 01:08:01,572
He used to have the smallest stone
in the whole place.

972
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,406
Not anymore.

973
01:08:10,819 --> 01:08:13,310
This is what you spent
your money on?

974
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,416
He's my dad.

975
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:25,124
It takes a while
for the heat to come up.

976
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:27,928
I know.
It'll be up by spring.

977
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:39,175
You know, my father's alive
and I don't buy him anything.

978
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,808
You're like a saint.

979
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,080
Because I bought my father
a headstone?

980
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,618
Saint Chuck.

981
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,918
Not just for that.

982
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:54,129
You're nice.

983
01:08:58,066 --> 01:08:59,260
Decent.

984
01:09:14,449 --> 01:09:15,939
You think I'm decent?

985
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,554
Remember the first time
you made me eggs in my apartment?

986
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,895
And you took off your robe?

987
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:31,326
My eyes had a heart attack.

988
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,996
And every time after that...

989
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,504
...it didn't matter
what you were wearing.

990
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,841
You could've worn
a suit of armor.

991
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,945
I got hot and crazy.

992
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:46,979
There's your Saint Chuck.

993
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,744
It's 30 degrees in here
and I am sweating.

994
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:59,360
I think we'll skip the coffee.
I'm sober.

995
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,762
I'm sober too.
And I have to talk to you.

996
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,495
- What about?
- About this.

997
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,472
You're a very good talker.

998
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:04,254
The zipper's on the side, honey.

999
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:05,819
I got it.

1000
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,404
Want to know something funny?

1001
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,343
I don't smoke.

1002
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:14,255
Did you ever see the movie, <i>Klute</i>?

1003
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,452
What?

1004
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,928
The movie with Jane Fonda, <i>Klute.</i>

1005
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,124
No, I don't think so.

1006
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,728
She plays a call girl.

1007
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:26,331
And she's with this guy,
you know?

1008
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,074
A customer.

1009
01:12:29,177 --> 01:12:31,975
And they're doing it,
and she's screaming and moaning...

1010
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,308
...as if it's, like,
the end of the world for her.

1011
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,854
And then, right in the middle,
when the guy's not looking...

1012
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,114
...she looks at her watch...

1013
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,383
...and you just know it's an act.

1014
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,700
I don't wear a watch.

1015
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,321
Where you been?

1016
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,054
We moved.

1017
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,452
<i>William, it's so nice to see you</i>

1018
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,824
<i>At nine o'clock this evening</i>

1019
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:29,760
You're drunk from last night.

1020
01:13:30,705 --> 01:13:32,605
Drunk, yes. But not from wine.

1021
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,033
Beer.

1022
01:13:37,345 --> 01:13:40,246
What is it with you? You're late!
It's been mayhem in here!

1023
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,781
I got stiffs coming in,
I got girls going out.

1024
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:44,679
Where's Belinda?
She hasn't checked in.

1025
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,815
I would not count on Belinda
coming back to work.

1026
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:51,082
What happened? Is she all right?
Did somebody rough her up?

1027
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,193
Nobody roughed her up.

1028
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,054
Will you put away your muscles?

1029
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,464
Something happened last night.

1030
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:03,569
Something passed between us.

1031
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:07,433
Her life couldn't possibly be the same.

1032
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:11,640
Sorry I'm late. Hi, Chuck!

1033
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,619
Remember that guy, Schisselman?
He called and he wants to meet you.

1034
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,683
He's nice.

1035
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:27,719
What are you doing?

1036
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:30,329
What do you mean, what's she doing?
She's working.

1037
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,192
Is that true?

1038
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,398
Really?

1039
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,266
I have to earn a living, right?

1040
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:49,382
You told me this morning
you weren't faking.

1041
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,651
I wasn't faking.

1042
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:54,856
Faking what?

1043
01:14:55,323 --> 01:14:56,255
Please, Bill.

1044
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,187
Get out of town!

1045
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,052
You two guys?

1046
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,287
Can I please have
a conversation with her?

1047
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,759
You haven't quit?

1048
01:15:10,972 --> 01:15:11,939
How can I quit?

1049
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,266
Very simply. You open your mouth
and say, "Bill, Chuck...

1050
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:16,637
...I quit."

1051
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,170
Okay. And then what do I do?

1052
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,508
No, I mean it!

1053
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:25,276
Where do I go from there?

1054
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:26,977
What happens to me?

1055
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,661
What happens to you is....

1056
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,604
I can't get over the fact
that you didn't quit.

1057
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:45,562
Right!

1058
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:47,371
I didn't quit!

1059
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,600
Did you quit?

1060
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,936
I'm not a whore!

1061
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,079
No, you're a pimp!

1062
01:15:53,281 --> 01:15:55,749
Let's stop before we say
something we regret.

1063
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,418
Shut up!

1064
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,489
I need a ride.

1065
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,362
I have to drive her.

1066
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:15,599
Fine.

1067
01:16:18,673 --> 01:16:19,765
You'll be all right?

1068
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,474
You know us pimps. Fine.

1069
01:16:26,147 --> 01:16:28,206
I need the car keys.
You got them?

1070
01:16:28,683 --> 01:16:30,412
Thank you. I got them.

1071
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,510
- He didn't mean what he said.
- Yes, he did.

1072
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,744
No, he's....

1073
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,048
He's a strange guy.

1074
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:12,693
He's not like you and me.
He probably thought...

1075
01:17:15,096 --> 01:17:16,927
...you two were in love.

1076
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,423
So did I.

1077
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:35,581
Look...

1078
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,018
...you don't want to go up.

1079
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:45,955
So I'll drive you home.

1080
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,220
Wait. What about the trick?

1081
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,366
I'll come back later, get him drunk,
take off his clothes.

1082
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,626
In the morning,
he'll think you were there.

1083
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:56,628
No problem.

1084
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:17,548
City Morgue.

1085
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,318
Somebody died?

1086
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,791
Who cares?

1087
01:18:35,076 --> 01:18:36,270
Why'd you lock the door?

1088
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,277
It's okay.

1089
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,182
Sirs?

1090
01:18:46,454 --> 01:18:48,718
At least Franklin
paid off for two years.

1091
01:18:48,923 --> 01:18:50,083
Until he got stupid.

1092
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,292
You never even sent us a nickel.

1093
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,722
Not one nickel.

1094
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,292
- I don't know--
- I don't, I don't know.

1095
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,628
If you were up-front,
we could've worked it out.

1096
01:19:01,836 --> 01:19:03,360
But now it's too late.

1097
01:19:03,571 --> 01:19:04,936
We're angry.

1098
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,129
We're insulted.

1099
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,670
Besides, wouldn't be right to let
you live after we killed Franklin.

1100
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,073
He was our friend.

1101
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,673
I'd like to be your friend.

1102
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,942
Please, God!
Let me be your friend--

1103
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:43,735
Come on, let's get out of here.

1104
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,539
If we bust one bozo,
we got to bust the whole place.

1105
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,682
I hate Narcotics.

1106
01:19:48,883 --> 01:19:51,078
I wish they'd put us back on Vice.

1107
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:52,919
Could I have the check, please?

1108
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:54,855
Pretty good beat, huh?

1109
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,353
Peachy.

1110
01:19:57,725 --> 01:19:59,590
I noticed you guys were...

1111
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:03,593
...unencumbered by
female companionship.

1112
01:20:07,268 --> 01:20:08,860
So how'd you like to get...

1113
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,232
...encumbered?

1114
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:15,868
Okay, boys. Here we are.

1115
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:19,240
I wonder why that door's locked.

1116
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:21,514
In the morgue?

1117
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:24,310
I know what you're thinking.
Don't worry about it.

1118
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:28,080
It won't bother you if you don't think
about all those dead people.

1119
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:34,925
Let me get my phone book.
It's got all my numbers in it.

1120
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,493
I wonder where that book is.

1121
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,359
Maybe my partner has it.
Follow me.

1122
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:47,332
You're about to become
one of the Great Lakes. Open up.

1123
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,442
I said, open up!

1124
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,208
Get ready to fill him up.

1125
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:55,639
This is to make some holes
so the water comes out.

1126
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:02,612
Again locked.

1127
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,261
What's going on?

1128
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:14,559
Excuse me.

1129
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,401
Hold it! Police!

1130
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,168
You guys are police?

1131
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,547
How could they be cops?

1132
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,350
I should have asked for an ID.

1133
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,273
Son of a bitch!

1134
01:21:54,475 --> 01:21:55,772
That's it!
Cool it! I quit!

1135
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,342
You what?!

1136
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:58,938
That's it, man!

1137
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,075
Party's over, numb-nuts!

1138
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:05,412
Man, you blew it!

1139
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:07,588
Let me hit him one time!

1140
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:20,665
It's all over, buddy.

1141
01:22:21,035 --> 01:22:22,559
Were you scared?

1142
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,093
Were you?

1143
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:26,563
Mostly dizzy.

1144
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,532
I tell you, you were great!

1145
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:31,473
Guys were shooting over you
and you just laid there.

1146
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,170
You never complained once.
I admire that.

1147
01:22:34,382 --> 01:22:37,249
- I have a great respect--
- Take off the tape.

1148
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:44,215
Look up here.

1149
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,591
Turn sideways.

1150
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:50,263
Other way.

1151
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:57,036
Okay, leave!

1152
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:03,942
Somebody have a comb,
so I can just get ready?

1153
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:06,477
I wasn't ready for that.

1154
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,145
Just turn sideways.

1155
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:15,645
Leave.

1156
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:17,847
Today!

1157
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:22,753
You're good at this game.

1158
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:24,454
Last one.
Best of three.

1159
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,928
Even, shoot!

1160
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,997
Great. Fair is fair.

1161
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:32,567
We took a shot, right?

1162
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,172
Can't hit a home run
unless you bat.

1163
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:37,776
I wish I had a bat right now.

1164
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:39,937
You had to bring the police?

1165
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,479
That's gratitude.

1166
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:44,481
If I didn't bring the police,
you'd be dead now.

1167
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,678
So? I'd be better off.
I'd rather be dead.

1168
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:49,481
You want to be dead?

1169
01:23:53,327 --> 01:23:55,090
Do you want to be dead?

1170
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:02,333
You let me know
if you change your mind.

1171
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,437
You'll be the first.

1172
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,167
How you doing?

1173
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:12,975
That's great.

1174
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,945
You get me in jail here
with Peter Lorre's son.

1175
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:21,086
"Oh, come on. We have to be pimps.
Let's be pimps."

1176
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,348
We couldn't be doctors.

1177
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:34,094
We were rolling there
for a while though.

1178
01:24:35,169 --> 01:24:37,364
Cash, clothes.

1179
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:39,571
I'll tell you something.

1180
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,774
You couldn't do
what we did in Russia.

1181
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,739
You know? Seriously.

1182
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,476
- Russian pimp--
- Would you do me a favor?

1183
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:50,242
Just leave me alone.

1184
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:57,424
There's room for one more.

1185
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:15,266
I thought you were in Indiana.

1186
01:25:16,477 --> 01:25:18,240
My mom called.

1187
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:23,014
And you flew all the way back here.

1188
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:26,378
I thought for sure when you
found out what I was doing...

1189
01:25:26,587 --> 01:25:28,111
...you'd just hate me.

1190
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,785
No, not you.

1191
01:25:31,425 --> 01:25:33,154
You came to be by my side.

1192
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:36,790
You are one in a million.

1193
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,536
Goodbye, Chuck.

1194
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,380
Did you see that?

1195
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:00,579
My fiancée just spit on me.

1196
01:26:01,088 --> 01:26:03,249
And after you were deloused.

1197
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,318
But she's right, you know.

1198
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:07,858
I should be spit on.

1199
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:13,356
He's got hair in his mouth.
What are you doing?

1200
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:15,433
It looks bad in front
of the guys.

1201
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:18,434
So what? What am I running for,
cell president?

1202
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,240
They have that?

1203
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,569
This is a nightmare.

1204
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,180
You know what
the worst part about this is?

1205
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:29,371
I'm guilty.

1206
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:30,642
I am guilty.

1207
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:33,946
You know what'll happen, don't you?
I'll lose my job.

1208
01:26:35,656 --> 01:26:37,487
My life is over.

1209
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,656
Do you know...

1210
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,089
...at this moment...

1211
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:44,093
...I have sunk as low as I can go?

1212
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,064
I was wrong.

1213
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,947
Mimi, pay the cab driver, will you?

1214
01:27:09,156 --> 01:27:10,418
Move over!

1215
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:12,389
With money!

1216
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,025
No jail can hold us.

1217
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,631
You got them out!

1218
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:21,597
You bet your Puerto Rican ass I did!

1219
01:27:21,802 --> 01:27:23,463
Can't keep my men in there.

1220
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,036
My life is over.

1221
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:26,940
Stay with him.
Take him home.

1222
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,665
Get him to the lawyer's on time.

1223
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:29,706
Piece of cake!

1224
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,108
We'll take you home,
we give you a nice bath.

1225
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:34,808
Wait a minute.

1226
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:36,244
I don't see Belinda here.

1227
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:37,849
She don't want to come.

1228
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:39,383
That's it!
Make him feel better.

1229
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:41,281
You know what I mean.

1230
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,659
Will this take long or what?

1231
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:52,890
I have a tennis lesson
at one o'clock.

1232
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,432
I already missed one
when we were in prison.

1233
01:27:55,636 --> 01:27:58,036
I see.
Can I get you anything?

1234
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,263
All right.

1235
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:03,672
- Lamb chops--
- I was thinking of something to drink.

1236
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:06,779
Why don't we just get started?

1237
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:16,783
Mr. Drollhauser...

1238
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:19,215
...are we going to prison?

1239
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:20,655
That's a good question.

1240
01:28:21,228 --> 01:28:23,025
I hardly think so.

1241
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,861
You see boys,
this is an election year...

1242
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:28,262
...and the party in power...

1243
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:29,731
...let's just say...

1244
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,371
...they find the whole
situation embarrassing.

1245
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:36,942
Therefore, it would be in the
best interest of all concerned...

1246
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:39,510
...if they just gave you boys
your jobs back...

1247
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,477
...and forgot the whole thing.

1248
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:44,782
I assume that's okay with you.

1249
01:28:52,259 --> 01:28:53,726
Mr. Drollhauser...

1250
01:28:54,795 --> 01:28:57,093
...that's the greatest thing
I ever heard!

1251
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:58,390
Thank you very much.

1252
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:00,066
That's fantastic!

1253
01:29:00,267 --> 01:29:01,962
Well, it's not okay with me!

1254
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:05,263
We got them over the barrel.

1255
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:07,739
As long as we do...

1256
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:10,535
...I say get something out of it.

1257
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:15,245
Can I talk to him alone please?

1258
01:29:33,567 --> 01:29:35,694
I have thought about this...

1259
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:38,167
...for the entire time in jail.

1260
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:41,468
And what I want is to go back...

1261
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:44,769
...to my old life, the way it was
before this craziness.

1262
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:46,105
I want...

1263
01:29:46,313 --> 01:29:48,474
...my old life back.

1264
01:29:49,116 --> 01:29:50,481
Please, Bill.

1265
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:53,513
Please let me have my old life back.

1266
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:03,859
If I did that, I'd never be able
to sleep with myself again.

1267
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:06,358
We are holding the cards.

1268
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:08,694
They're afraid of us.

1269
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:10,666
You see the beauty here?

1270
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:13,364
I say we go down there...

1271
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,600
...and march into the mayor's office
and lay it on the line.

1272
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:18,142
You want to?
It'll be fun.

1273
01:30:18,345 --> 01:30:19,334
It'll be great.

1274
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:25,543
I'm wearing white!

1275
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,695
Get away from the door!
Get away from the door!

1276
01:30:35,896 --> 01:30:37,329
You won't see the mayor!

1277
01:30:37,531 --> 01:30:40,967
You won't make any demands
or I'm going to kill you!

1278
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:42,696
You'll play tennis...

1279
01:30:42,903 --> 01:30:44,461
...with God!

1280
01:30:47,374 --> 01:30:49,842
Are you going to change your mind?

1281
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,345
Are you going to change your mind?

1282
01:30:57,418 --> 01:30:59,079
You got to keep that elbow stiff.

1283
01:31:02,456 --> 01:31:03,980
What's going on in there?

1284
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:08,756
My God!

1285
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:15,294
I could have you guys
executed for this!

1286
01:31:17,838 --> 01:31:19,032
Call maintenance!

1287
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,798
Get them up here!

1288
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,578
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

1289
01:31:25,779 --> 01:31:28,304
- Are you okay, Mr. Chuckie?
- I'm calm.

1290
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:29,574
I'm calm.

1291
01:31:29,783 --> 01:31:31,842
- I'm calm, I promise.
- Are you bleeding?

1292
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:33,516
It's okay, girls.

1293
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:34,653
You can let go.

1294
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,696
Let me tell you something.
You listen to me, Mr. Idea Man.

1295
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:50,598
I will go back to the morgue.

1296
01:31:50,804 --> 01:31:52,795
And I will put my life straight.

1297
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:54,031
A life you ruined!

1298
01:31:54,241 --> 01:31:56,903
Everything that's bad
that happened to me, you did!

1299
01:31:57,411 --> 01:31:58,969
I don't want to see you anymore.

1300
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,273
I don't want to hear from you anymore.

1301
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:04,042
I don't even want to hear rumors
about you anymore.

1302
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:05,081
Here's an idea:

1303
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:08,585
Get a ticket on the first
space shuttle and get out of here.

1304
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:10,285
Excuse me.

1305
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:28,605
How are you?

1306
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,441
What have you been doing?

1307
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,443
You mean, since jail?

1308
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,414
I'm back to work.

1309
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:39,718
Yeah, me too.

1310
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,353
I start a new job tonight.

1311
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,554
Really, what are you doing?

1312
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:49,426
It's the same thing I did before.
It's just in a different place.

1313
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,894
Paradise Found, just off Sixth?

1314
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:53,229
I've heard of it.

1315
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:55,493
It's supposed to be real nice.

1316
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:02,967
Look, I may not see you again.
I'm moving on Friday.

1317
01:33:06,046 --> 01:33:07,035
Condo.

1318
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:10,082
Very good investment.

1319
01:33:23,163 --> 01:33:25,631
You don't want to be late
for your first day.

1320
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:55,328
Where the fuck is 4K?

1321
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:59,626
Excuse me!
I didn't know you was deaf!

1322
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:01,266
4K!

1323
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,032
I'm 4K.
Is that my dinner?

1324
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:06,001
You do with it what you want.

1325
01:34:06,473 --> 01:34:07,770
It's five bucks.

1326
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,533
I already added in my tip.

1327
01:34:10,044 --> 01:34:11,341
How thoughtful.

1328
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:15,073
Thank you.

1329
01:34:20,054 --> 01:34:23,217
Excuse me.
There's mustard on this sandwich.

1330
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:24,356
So?

1331
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:26,150
So? It's egg salad.

1332
01:34:26,593 --> 01:34:28,060
Give me the sandwich!

1333
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,195
Happy now?

1334
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:43,802
I would like a whole new sandwich.

1335
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:49,215
Listen to me.

1336
01:34:58,092 --> 01:34:59,184
- Listen!
- Take it easy.

1337
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:00,257
Listen to me!

1338
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:03,521
I will never again eat a sandwich
I did not order!

1339
01:35:03,797 --> 01:35:07,096
I am sick and tired
of being afraid.

1340
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:09,667
Bad jobs, bad sandwiches,
neurotic girlfriends.

1341
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,361
No longer for this man!
Do you understand?

1342
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:16,101
You!

1343
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:17,874
Go home!

1344
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:22,473
And you!

1345
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:24,776
Go clean off my door!

1346
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:51,735
Excuse me.

1347
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:53,841
I joined this club
a month ago...

1348
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:56,515
...and have not received
my membership cards.

1349
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:59,413
Could you please call the manager?
I'll find him myself.

1350
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:00,678
Hey, sir!

1351
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:20,331
Is everything all right, Mr. Tuttle?

1352
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:22,668
Where's the goddamn towel boy?

1353
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,810
I'm not coming out of
this pool naked!

1354
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:26,604
Not with these parrots around!

1355
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:29,180
Of course, Mr. Tuttle.

1356
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:31,677
Towel boy!

1357
01:36:35,823 --> 01:36:36,847
Sorry.

1358
01:36:38,258 --> 01:36:41,591
Hi, Mr. Manetti.
Nice threads, very Miami Beach.

1359
01:36:41,795 --> 01:36:43,558
Mr. Tuttle would like a towel.

1360
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:45,732
All right. Yes, sir.
Here you go.

1361
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:48,060
Hey, Mr. Tuttle.
How you doing?

1362
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,426
How's everything?
There you are, sir.

1363
01:36:50,637 --> 01:36:51,695
Got one.

1364
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:54,069
Maybe you ought to take two.

1365
01:36:54,274 --> 01:36:56,299
I don't think one'll do it.

1366
01:36:56,643 --> 01:36:58,110
Less seen the better.

1367
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:03,047
Excuse me, Mr. Tuttle.

1368
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:06,652
Do you know Belinda Keaton?

1369
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:08,287
No, I don't.

1370
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:11,785
Listen, helium-head, how hard
is it to pass out towels?

1371
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:13,482
It's a skill like anything else.

1372
01:37:13,694 --> 01:37:17,186
People pay $8,000 just to join
this club. They expect service.

1373
01:37:17,397 --> 01:37:19,922
Stop screwing around
or you're out of here.

1374
01:37:20,133 --> 01:37:21,964
- Beat it!
- All right... jackoff.

1375
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,627
- What was that?
- It wasn't me. It was the birds.

1376
01:37:25,839 --> 01:37:26,863
Birds.

1377
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:32,210
Why are you here?

1378
01:37:32,412 --> 01:37:33,379
Why are you here?

1379
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:34,569
I'm looking for Belinda.

1380
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:35,748
Is she working here?

1381
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:37,879
Excuse me.

1382
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:42,117
Don't go thinking I work here,
because I don't.

1383
01:37:42,322 --> 01:37:44,256
I own it.
I bought it this morning.

1384
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,187
- Straighten that strap.
- Drop dead!

1385
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:47,792
All right, you're fired!

1386
01:37:47,995 --> 01:37:50,395
Clean out your locker.
You're history.

1387
01:37:50,597 --> 01:37:52,189
Don't go up.
You'll get in trouble.

1388
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:53,866
With who? You own the place.

1389
01:37:54,067 --> 01:37:58,197
I know. But I got partners!
Come on, these guys are tough!

1390
01:37:58,772 --> 01:38:02,640
I'm not kidding you.
These guys are built like Checker Cabs.

1391
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:04,970
- Don't!
- Sorry.

1392
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:08,104
- Don't go in there!
- Sorry.

1393
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,383
I'm not letting you get--

1394
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:15,978
Hey, we're in here!

1395
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:17,816
What am I going to do?

1396
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:19,822
You want a membership?
I'll get a commission--

1397
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:22,495
Will you just stay out of my life?

1398
01:38:23,297 --> 01:38:25,857
You don't have to tell me
three times. I'm out!

1399
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:27,090
Bud.

1400
01:38:45,218 --> 01:38:46,879
Can I buy you a drink?

1401
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:49,078
I changed my mind.
I don't work--

1402
01:38:49,289 --> 01:38:50,756
I'll make it worth your while.

1403
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:53,552
- I don't feel like it.
- The party's just starting!

1404
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,024
- I really don't feel like it.
- Come on!

1405
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:58,561
Am I glad I found you.
I got to talk to you.

1406
01:38:58,765 --> 01:39:01,256
- I saw her first!
- Actually, I saw her first.

1407
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:03,129
Remember the argument we had?

1408
01:39:03,337 --> 01:39:04,804
- You were right.
- I was wrong!

1409
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:06,768
- Are you done?
- No. Now, listen.

1410
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:09,135
You were waiting for me
to say I love you...

1411
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:10,901
...but I didn't have the guts!

1412
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:13,306
I've got the guts now!

1413
01:39:13,513 --> 01:39:14,377
I love you too.

1414
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:16,139
I'll show you how much.

1415
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,341
Listen, slime,
you have three seconds...

1416
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:21,612
...to take your hands off
this particular woman! One....

1417
01:39:24,057 --> 01:39:26,287
Hold on, Chuck, I'm coming, buddy!

1418
01:39:29,162 --> 01:39:32,654
Where's the manager?
You guys stay right here!

1419
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:34,827
Are you all right?

1420
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:36,832
Did you break anything?

1421
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:39,930
I caught an updraft.

1422
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:43,443
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry, I'm all right.

1423
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,635
Fortunately, the ground
broke my fall.

1424
01:39:45,846 --> 01:39:47,939
Tell her what you were
going to tell her.

1425
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:58,221
You love me?

1426
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,255
I said it.

1427
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:08,998
I didn't say it.

1428
01:40:14,474 --> 01:40:15,805
I love you.

1429
01:40:21,381 --> 01:40:22,939
Can we do that again?

1430
01:40:25,485 --> 01:40:28,784
Guys, my neck.
You got my neck a little bit.

1431
01:40:28,989 --> 01:40:30,251
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

1432
01:40:30,457 --> 01:40:31,583
I'm real happy for you.

1433
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:35,057
Okay, piss-head!
You're fired!

1434
01:40:36,029 --> 01:40:37,826
That suits him just fine.

1435
01:40:38,031 --> 01:40:40,932
He's not a towel boy.
He's an idea man!

1436
01:40:41,134 --> 01:40:43,534
He couldn't find his asshole
with a funnel.

1437
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:45,595
Never mind.

1438
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,370
The guy's right.

1439
01:40:47,574 --> 01:40:49,041
- He's wrong!
- He's right.

1440
01:40:49,242 --> 01:40:51,233
I've never done one thing...

1441
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,936
...I ever said I was going to do.

1442
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:57,145
That is not true.
Remember when we first met?

1443
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,375
You said,
"I'll make a man out of you."

1444
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:01,747
Could I have done
all this without you?

1445
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:03,052
Done all what?

1446
01:41:14,835 --> 01:41:17,133
You can't talk to
my very good friend...

1447
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:19,396
...and the woman
that I love like that.

1448
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,000
Now, look.

1449
01:41:21,274 --> 01:41:25,210
I know that you're a very powerful man.

1450
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:29,576
I know that you could break my back
like a little toothpick.

1451
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:32,877
There's only one question
I've got to ask.

1452
01:41:33,887 --> 01:41:36,048
Is that a gun under your jacket?

1453
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:39,147
Fine.

1454
01:41:48,635 --> 01:41:50,660
Vice Squad!
It's a raid!

1455
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:53,134
Vice Squad! Vice Squad!

1456
01:42:05,519 --> 01:42:06,952
Put some clothes on, idiot!

1457
01:42:07,154 --> 01:42:08,519
Don't touch the car, punk!

1458
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:10,417
Wait, they're not coming!

1459
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,622
We made it!

1460
01:42:14,961 --> 01:42:16,155
You were great!

1461
01:42:16,363 --> 01:42:18,058
You were kissing!

1462
01:42:18,331 --> 01:42:19,229
I'm cold!

1463
01:42:19,432 --> 01:42:21,263
You were fabulous!

1464
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:22,725
Here you go.
Thanks.

1465
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:26,736
Hey, Chuck, here you go:
microwave clothing. Listen to this!

1466
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:29,465
You can stay warm
and bake a potato in your pants!

1467
01:42:29,676 --> 01:42:31,940
I think you can do better than that.

1468
01:42:32,612 --> 01:42:35,080
Baked potato.
I could kill for a baked potato.

1469
01:42:35,282 --> 01:42:36,613
Let's eat!
