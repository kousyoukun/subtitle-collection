1
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,139
You're going the wrong way!

2
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:59,834
Franklin!

3
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:12,480
What the hell's wrong with you?

4
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:14,444
You bastard!

5
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,845
You all right?

6
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:29,593
Who's that?

7
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:30,990
Your momma!

8
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:01,051
Franklin, you forgot your coat.

9
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:06,358
- I'm going to dunk on you.
- You couldn't dunk doughnuts.

10
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:07,495
A dollar!

11
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:08,755
You got it.

12
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,762
Step aside, chump.

13
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,632
Pay up, sucker!

14
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,097
Christ!

15
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:54,399
Do you recognize this man as
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jones?

16
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,273
What was your...

17
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,276
...relationship with the deceased?

18
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,551
He was my Avon lady.

19
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,446
- Give me a break.
- Give me a break!

20
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,314
You think this is
a thrilling morning for me?

21
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,545
Eat an Egg McMuffin,
look at a dead guy.

22
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:10,588
Look, honey, I--

23
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,451
I'm not your honey.

24
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:14,255
It's Belinda.

25
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:17,031
As a matter of fact,
it's Miss Keaton.

26
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,200
Are you listening to this?

27
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,633
She's a whore.

28
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:24,335
Hello.

29
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,367
And this guy here was her pimp!

30
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,943
He didn't pay off someone
like he was supposed to...

31
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:33,875
...so somebody made him
kiss the sidewalk.

32
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:36,078
Can I close the drawer now?

33
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:37,512
Sure.

34
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,853
All right. Now can you tell me
who sent him to pimp heaven?

35
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:45,422
- Sure! Now can you kiss my ass?
- For how much?

36
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,289
Is someone going to pick up Mr. Jones?
We sure could use the space.

37
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:51,191
You've got it, sport.

38
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:54,798
Sir, could you sign right here?

39
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,558
Excuse me.

40
00:07:57,336 --> 00:08:01,365
Franklin once told me that
he wanted to be buried in his car.

41
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:03,737
We don't do that.

42
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,273
You'd probably have to call
the funeral home...

43
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:09,276
...or the Department of Motor Vehicles.

44
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,412
Don't I know you?

45
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,350
Yeah, I do. I do.

46
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,545
No. I couldn't.

47
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:18,779
I wouldn't!

48
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,550
I'm engaged.

49
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:24,320
Here's a picture
of my fiancée, Charlotte.

50
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:27,892
The picture doesn't do her justice.

51
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,397
She's suffering from water buildup.

52
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,863
I thought I knew you.

53
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,434
A lot of guys have my face.

54
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,965
This is my mom.

55
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,502
- You okay, Chuck?
- Thanks for waiting.

56
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,677
I'm taking off.

57
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:44,870
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good night.

58
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,180
Hi, Mr. Carboni.

59
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:50,848
Ain't you going home?

60
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:53,748
Hector's an hour late.
It's seven o'clock.

61
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:57,482
- Hector's been transferred.
- You got a new night man.

62
00:08:57,693 --> 00:09:01,152
Not exactly. Starting tomorrow,
you're on night shift.

63
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,863
Night shift?

64
00:09:04,265 --> 00:09:05,426
I started on night shift.

65
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,660
I'm here 6 years.
I thought I'd get a raise--

66
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,099
Are you going to make trouble?
Are you going to go over my head?

67
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,106
Night shift?

68
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,172
Hey, Chuckie, baby!

69
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:23,107
Come on!
Night shift's better!

70
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:26,482
There's no supervisors.
You practically run the place.

71
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,553
You like to read.
It's quiet at night.

72
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:31,656
- It's quiet during the day.
- Good. It's settled.

73
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,952
See you tomorrow night.
You'll be breaking in a new partner.

74
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,459
Bill something or other.

75
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,063
Mr. Carboni?

76
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,427
Who has my job?

77
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:46,334
Right here.
It's right on here.

78
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:53,942
He seems to have
the same last name you do.

79
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:57,248
I think he's my nephew.
I'll see you, Chuck.

80
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,589
Well, that's just wonderful.

81
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,233
What am I supposed to be doing
every night while you're working?

82
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:19,902
- I'll be home days.
- I work days.

83
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:22,800
All normal people work days.

84
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:24,702
Should I have quit?
Want me to go--

85
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,208
Why ask me? I don't know why
you work there in the first place.

86
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:30,504
Your mother says you're
a financial wizard.

87
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,647
Why do you listen to my mother?
This is the same woman...

88
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,478
...who goes to a séance every
Friday night since my father died...

89
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,210
...just so she can still yell at him.

90
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,532
How long will you be on there?

91
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,292
Until the wedding.

92
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,800
That's nine months.

93
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:58,063
Don't you want me to look good?

94
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,934
I think you look good now.

95
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,868
And I think you're
the sweetest man in the world.

96
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,625
Every day!

97
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:47,739
You're going the wrong way!

98
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:03,689
You the night guy?

99
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:08,652
How you doing?
I'm Leonard Carboni.

100
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:11,353
What a pleasure to meet you, Leonard.

101
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,922
- How was your first day?
- Shitty!

102
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:16,034
- A lot of paperwork.
- I see.

103
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,033
Uncle Sal said you'd
straighten it out.

104
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:19,398
Fine.

105
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:35,136
<i>Jumpin' Jack Flash</i>

106
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:42,478
How you doing?

107
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:43,741
I'm Bill Blazejowski.

108
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,282
Call me Billy Blaze.
You must be Chuck.

109
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:47,749
Nice shoes.

110
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,015
This is all right.

111
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:53,682
Guess this is where I'll be working.
I'm your new partner.

112
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,987
Swish! They're going crazy
in the arena!

113
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,063
They can't believe it!
Unbelievable!

114
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:02,497
Great! What's our job?
Drive around and pick up stiffs?

115
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,533
Is that what we're supposed to do?

116
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:05,830
Who's this? Wife?

117
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,563
Fiancée.

118
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,236
Nice frame.

119
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,407
We can make stuff. We can read.

120
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,638
Coffee. This is great!

121
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,009
I like it.

122
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,841
You want to know why
I carry this tape recorder?

123
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,248
It's to tape things.

124
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,615
See...

125
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,322
...I'm an idea man, Chuck.
All right?

126
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,585
I get ideas all day.
I can't control them.

127
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,454
It's like they come charging in.

128
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,632
I can't even fight them
if I wanted to.

129
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,459
So I say them in here.

130
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,260
That way, I never forget them.

131
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,334
Okay, here's an example.

132
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,401
Watch out. Stand back.

133
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,699
This is Bill.

134
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:45,273
Idea to eliminate garbage.

135
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,306
Edible paper.

136
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,205
Eat it, it's gone.

137
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,851
Eat it, it's out of there.
No garbage.

138
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,850
I got everything in here.
Business ideas, inventions.

139
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,215
I wrote a couple of musicals.

140
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:01,084
Would you like to see
the rest of the office?

141
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,424
Want a Snickers? It's not frozen,
my refrigerator broke.

142
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:06,493
I understand.

143
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:09,331
Where you from?
I'm from Cleveland.

144
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,591
I'm originally from Seattle.

145
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:14,032
- And this is our lab.
- Yeah, it's nice.

146
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:16,229
Get this.
I'm living with this chick.

147
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,133
I come home,
I catch her in bed...

148
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:19,398
...with another girl.

149
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:21,440
I went, "No!"
I couldn't believe it!

150
00:16:21,644 --> 00:16:24,339
She went lesbo on me, like that.
Unbelievable!

151
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:27,517
I just finished my dinner.
I walked right out of there.

152
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:30,514
- What do you think? Was that wrong?
- That's very personal--

153
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,516
What's in here?
Just stiffs and stuff?

154
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,120
No, we call them corpses.

155
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:35,948
- Can I take a peek?
- Sure.

156
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:36,987
I think there's one--

157
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:39,093
This Carboni guy.
Is he our boss?

158
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:42,229
He's the supervisor.
He's not here at night.

159
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,490
Get out of town!
Just you, me and the stiffs alone?

160
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,667
That's going to be radical!

161
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:49,597
That guy's dead.

162
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:00,745
Charlotte?

163
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:05,280
You've been in there half an hour.
You okay?

164
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:06,575
I'm fat.

165
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:08,217
You're not fat.

166
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm fat!

167
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,884
This is my one night off.

168
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,527
I look forward to this all week.

169
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,094
Why don't you come to bed?

170
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:19,922
I just want to lose six more pounds.

171
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,966
Tonight?

172
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:27,466
Why don't you run into bed?
Maybe you'll lose pounds along the way.

173
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:30,703
All right, Chuck.
Just don't look at me.

174
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,703
Are the lights out?

175
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,639
Are the lights out?

176
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,387
Could you close the drapes?

177
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,320
Sure.

178
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,058
Could you just check
the apartment?

179
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:04,097
Why do I have to check
the apartment every time?

180
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:08,469
Would you, please? If you check
the apartment, then I can relax.

181
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:19,885
Nobody here.

182
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,740
Are you excited?

183
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:50,509
Like the French when Lindbergh landed.

184
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,251
Am I fat?

185
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:55,176
Am I fat?

186
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,549
You're a willow.

187
00:18:56,757 --> 00:18:57,883
You're a reed.

188
00:18:58,092 --> 00:18:59,954
You're Audrey Hepburn.

189
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:08,657
You're not fat.

190
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:09,857
That music.

191
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,035
What music?

192
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:12,099
That music.

193
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:13,931
What music?

194
00:19:16,077 --> 00:19:19,408
It's just a little loud music.

195
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,546
Well, it bothers me.

196
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:26,774
You let too many things bother you.

197
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:28,713
That way you'll never
have an orgas--

198
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:31,880
Don't you say that word!

199
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,579
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,585
I'm sorry.

201
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:00,277
Who the hell is that?

202
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,580
Did you knock on that door?

203
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:07,987
Well?

204
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,920
Mistake.
It's a very big mistake.

205
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,718
Luke, who is it?

206
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,590
Some dwarf.

207
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:16,293
Thank you.

208
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:19,961
What's taking so long?
Will he stop playing that awful music?

209
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:24,036
- We were just getting to that--
- What's she mean, "awful music"?

210
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:27,374
Awful good.
She meant awful good.

211
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:32,973
Why don't you go back inside?
I'll be right in.

212
00:20:33,514 --> 00:20:35,878
Go play with your rope.

213
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,143
Don't be long, now.

214
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,917
Sorry.
We'll keep it down, okay?

215
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:46,317
I knew I recognized you!

216
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,186
Last week, at the morgue.

217
00:20:48,393 --> 00:20:50,159
I knew I recognized you.

218
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:53,491
I'd probably seen you
in the building when I moved in.

219
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:54,897
You live here?

220
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:57,028
But don't worry.

221
00:20:57,236 --> 00:21:00,069
Luke is leaving town
with the rodeo, and I...

222
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:01,933
...hardly ever do business up here.

223
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:05,069
What kind of business are they doing?

224
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:07,637
She sells cowboy hats.

225
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,245
The man was in his underwear.

226
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,772
And cowboy underwear.

227
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:14,851
Belinda! Come on, darling.
Haul it in here, now.

228
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:16,418
I'll be right in.

229
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:17,850
I've got to go.

230
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:19,080
We'll keep it down.

231
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:21,083
See you around, neighbor.

232
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:24,152
I took care of that.
Let's go back inside.

233
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:25,855
I think I should go home.

234
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:28,761
Why? They said they'll keep it down.

235
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,125
When did you get dressed?

236
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:34,202
It wasn't going to be any good
tonight anyway. I feel so guilty!

237
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,402
I cheated today.

238
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,807
- You're kidding.
- I had a Nestle's Crunch bar.

239
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:43,541
Food.

240
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:47,005
I feel like dirt.
I am really sorry.

241
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:49,481
No one else would be
this patient with me.

242
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,880
I'll see you next Sunday.

243
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:17,210
Food came.

244
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:19,777
You owe me three dollars.

245
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:23,511
I'm really getting good
at remembering these cards.

246
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:25,747
Twenty-one.

247
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:28,178
Boy, I tell you...

248
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,413
...this weekend is it.

249
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:33,625
This weekend,
I go to Atlantic City...

250
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:36,728
...and I do nothing but play blackjack
straight through.

251
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,898
I won't even get a room,
I'll just get those Wash 'N Drys.

252
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,796
You know? Did I tell you
I thought of them first?

253
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:44,697
Only they already had them.

254
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,563
Twenty-one.
What's the matter?

255
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:50,070
I ordered egg salad
and they sent me tuna fish.

256
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:53,713
They always send the wrong food.
Send it back, get what you want.

257
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:55,779
They get angry if you complain.

258
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:56,912
It's all right.

259
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,083
The chef has a lot on his mind.

260
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,943
Like what? Curing cancer?

261
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:06,152
Wait a minute.

262
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,988
Hold the phone.

263
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:10,091
I got it!

264
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:12,285
Oh, you're going to cure cancer.

265
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:14,493
Tuna fish.

266
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:16,756
What if you mix...

267
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:19,095
...mayonnaise in the can
with the tuna?

268
00:23:19,303 --> 00:23:20,134
Hold it!

269
00:23:20,336 --> 00:23:22,236
Hold it! Wait a minute!

270
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:25,373
Take live tuna fish...

271
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:27,544
...and feed them mayonnaise.

272
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:28,677
This is good.

273
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,107
Call StarKist.

274
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,445
This is great!

275
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,947
<i>Wall Street Journal</i>?
Why not the <i>Enquirer</i>?

276
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:37,381
It interests me.
I was an investment counselor.

277
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:38,849
No kidding?

278
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:39,952
What's that?

279
00:23:40,156 --> 00:23:41,419
It's like a stockbroker.

280
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,218
So what are you doing
babysitting stiffs?

281
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:49,223
You're a drinker, big drinker?

282
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:52,426
Toothead. Doper.
Nose candy. Coke.

283
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:54,733
Come on.

284
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:57,527
It was a very rough job!

285
00:23:57,739 --> 00:24:00,401
I'd shape up a deal over two months,
another man...

286
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,702
...would come in
and take all the credit.

287
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:06,678
I just needed a place that was quiet.
I'm in a transitional period.

288
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:10,818
What kind of paper is this?
No sports, no comics, no Ann Landers.

289
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:13,316
Can I help you?

290
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,285
Yes, I'm looking
for a Mr. Blazejowski.

291
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,520
I'm Jefferey Durkin.

292
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:22,990
You sure are.

293
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:24,356
How you doing, Jeff?

294
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:27,363
You got money for me?
Some cash? Some do-re-mi?

295
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,035
- 20 bucks, right?
- 20 bucks. Thanks.

296
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:32,363
Wait outside while
I'm getting the car.

297
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:34,334
- Sure.
- All right, there you go.

298
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,666
Nice tux!

299
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,035
Good fit!

300
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:43,406
I don't want to be a buttinksy,
but what exactly is going on?

301
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:47,381
Some kind of debutante ball.
Kid wants me to take him and his girl.

302
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,520
You're taking one of
the morgue vehicles?

303
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,383
It's a limo, ain't it?
It's a limo for dead people.

304
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,149
Did you see that kid?

305
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,426
Wait. Are you telling me...

306
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,994
...that every night you leave,
this is what you do?

307
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,028
There isn't a debutante ball
every night.

308
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,792
I do weddings, bar mitzvahs
or just cruise the airport.

309
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,971
I picked up these Japanese guys.

310
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,331
$400 from the airport to the U.N.

311
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:10,233
You're ripping off diplomats!

312
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,271
Here.

313
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,703
It's $100.

314
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:14,136
What is this for?

315
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,313
Okay, big-time, let's roll!

316
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,004
Rock and roll!

317
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,725
What happens if we get a call?

318
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:37,522
If you have to go
and pick up a body or....

319
00:25:38,565 --> 00:25:39,898
I'll be back.

320
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:43,972
By the time I get there,
they won't be dead anymore?

321
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:47,932
Hey, kid.
Do you like music?

322
00:25:48,143 --> 00:25:49,633
- Sure!
- Good.

323
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,749
<i>Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas-gas-gas</i>

324
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,944
<i>Okay, Hoppy, lead the way.</i>

325
00:26:34,653 --> 00:26:37,382
<i>Oh, Pebbles! Daddy's home!</i>

326
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:45,787
Good evening, Leonard.

327
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,430
Hi, Mr. Lumley.

328
00:26:48,132 --> 00:26:49,656
Boy, that Barney Rubble.

329
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:51,129
What an actor!

330
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:54,668
We got some bodies in the wrong drawers.
But Uncle Sal said--

331
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:56,305
I'd straighten it out.

332
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:57,530
Good night, Mr. Lumley.

333
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,471
<i>Flintstones, meet them Flintstones</i>

334
00:27:00,677 --> 00:27:03,077
<i>They're the modern Stone Age family</i>

335
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,220
"Name of the deceased."

336
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:23,421
"Something Polish"?

337
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,865
I just saw jerky Leonard.
Why don't we have TV?

338
00:27:29,072 --> 00:27:30,801
Want to hear about my weekend?

339
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,267
I've been working
on my blackjack system.

340
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:35,142
All right. So.

341
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:36,776
I go down to Atlantic City...

342
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:39,209
...and I'm in the casino
with my Wash 'N Drys.

343
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:41,507
Did I tell you I had
the idea for them first?

344
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:44,709
Anyway, I'm sitting there
and I'm playing blackjack, right?

345
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,409
They bar me.

346
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:48,055
They bar me!

347
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:50,519
I'm out! I'm barred!
I can't get in now.

348
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:53,558
Right? You know why?
Being too good a player.

349
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:55,353
How much did you win?

350
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,725
I was down a couple hundred.

351
00:27:57,932 --> 00:27:59,764
But they could tell I was good.

352
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:02,457
They looked at me and threw me out.
They bar me.

353
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:05,195
So they deal me off the bottom.
I can tell.

354
00:28:05,406 --> 00:28:08,068
So I yell at the dealer.
He goes to the pit boss.

355
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:11,938
So I throw my complimentary
watered-down drink in his fat face!

356
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:16,006
So they barred me
for being too good a player.

357
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:18,813
Think I'll go to Vegas next week.

358
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:21,280
I wish you would shut up.

359
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:23,250
Vegas knows how to treat you right.

360
00:28:23,455 --> 00:28:25,650
Because you got broads
and Wayne Newton.

361
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,382
He's an Indian, did you know?

362
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:29,755
- I'll introduce you--
- Do me a favor?

363
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,588
Would you please shut up?

364
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:34,990
You telling me to shut up?

365
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,566
I'm telling you to shut up!

366
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,829
I will tell your recorder
so that you don't forget.

367
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,998
Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!

368
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:48,744
This used to be a quiet place
before you came.

369
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:50,937
You talk too much!

370
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:54,607
Edible paper?
Feeding mayonnaise to tuna fish?

371
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:58,151
I will give you a quarter
if you just stop talking!

372
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:01,847
Thank you.

373
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:23,838
I thought we were friends.

374
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:40,393
<i>Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!</i>

375
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:45,596
<i>Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!</i>

376
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,833
<i>Hello, this is Chuck
to remind Bill to shut up!</i>

377
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:54,100
<i>--Bill to shut up!</i>

378
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:07,380
Sorry that I yelled at you.

379
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,047
You think it's been easy on me?

380
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:16,922
I come in here,
I'm the new guy with no friends.

381
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,655
I confide in you my whole life!

382
00:30:19,866 --> 00:30:22,164
I tell you my deepest,
most intimate stuff.

383
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,267
You share anything with me?

384
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:29,774
I see a picture
of your fiancée everyday.

385
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,102
You don't even tell me her name.

386
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:35,503
I gave you $100.

387
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:36,737
I didn't ask for it.

388
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:39,439
That's what made it such
a beautiful gesture.

389
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,141
Never mind. Forget it.

390
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:45,083
We'll work together every night
like strangers. That's fine with me.

391
00:30:59,703 --> 00:31:01,033
Charlotte.

392
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:03,496
What?

393
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:07,235
My fiancée's name is Charlotte.

394
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,513
Oh, my God!

395
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,052
Did you fall down?
Did somebody hit you?

396
00:31:58,255 --> 00:32:01,953
It's the other way around.
Somebody hit me and then I fell down.

397
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:03,991
I wish I had my handkerchief.

398
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,893
I've got tissue in my purse.

399
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,258
Let me do it.

400
00:32:11,702 --> 00:32:13,501
Do you have a handkerchief?

401
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:14,536
Mugger!

402
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,102
I need your handkerchief.

403
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:38,992
Thank you.

404
00:32:41,465 --> 00:32:46,263
This was the first time I was
ever beaten up by a bunch of Bluebells.

405
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,061
I didn't like it.

406
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:49,738
How are you?

407
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:52,274
I'm great.

408
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:56,034
Four pounds of makeup,
they'll never know the difference.

409
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:57,576
Can I ask you a question?

410
00:32:58,446 --> 00:33:01,507
I wouldn't do it with a guy
until he paid me.

411
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:03,850
So, he beat me up.

412
00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:07,847
That's what happens
without a pimp.

413
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:09,820
Some guys figure,
why should they pay?

414
00:33:10,024 --> 00:33:12,585
That guy in the morgue.
He was your pimp, right?

415
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:17,227
A lot of Franklin's ladies
are in the same boat.

416
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:20,558
We could find another pimp...

417
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:23,032
...but some of those guys
are real rough.

418
00:33:23,637 --> 00:33:25,729
Get the girls hooked on dope.

419
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,872
Drugs or beat-up.
It's a nice choice.

420
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:32,005
You could do something different.
You're very bright.

421
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:34,538
Is your head okay?

422
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,276
Because I'm real tired.

423
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:42,447
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.
Thank you.

424
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:45,080
Thanks very much.

425
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,123
I hope everything turns out all right.

426
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,953
See you in the halls.

427
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,951
She was just lying there
in the elevator?

428
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,094
She was all beat-up.

429
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,892
That's why they have pimps.

430
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:28,791
That's what she said.

431
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:32,458
She knows a bunch
of girls that need pimps.

432
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,898
I really hope they find
someone trustworthy.

433
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:37,971
Are you crazy?

434
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,765
Those guys are killers.

435
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:41,500
They're animals.

436
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,609
They dress nice, though.

437
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,348
Wait a minute.

438
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:50,677
Hold the phone, Chuck.

439
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:53,219
We got all that space
down at the morgue.

440
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:57,189
All those cars. All that time at night.
Nobody watching us.

441
00:34:57,793 --> 00:34:59,350
We could handle things
for your neighbor...

442
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:01,621
...and her friends,
right out of the morgue!

443
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:04,957
Pimps?

444
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,361
Are you saying we should become pimps?

445
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,728
Pimps is an ugly word.

446
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:11,935
We'll call us Love Brokers.

447
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:14,430
This is my stop.
You think about it.

448
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:17,874
I really think this is the one.
I am excited about this. I mean it.

449
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,603
This is it, I think.

450
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:21,213
Love Brokers.

451
00:35:23,317 --> 00:35:25,148
Love Brokers!

452
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:28,316
You and me, buddy!

453
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,491
You're over the rainbow, pal.

454
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,686
Love Brokers.

455
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:13,762
Last week when you helped me...

456
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,260
...I got a little rude before you left.

457
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,934
Oh, no, you didn't.

458
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,796
Well, anyway....

459
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:22,936
We come home from work
at the same time each day.

460
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:27,137
I thought maybe we might
start having breakfast together.

461
00:36:28,745 --> 00:36:29,713
You got any eggs?

462
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,672
I practically have
a whole dairy in here.

463
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,008
Great!

464
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:39,579
Your place is beautiful!

465
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:42,383
And it's warm!
My place is freezing.

466
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:44,422
And you got a kitchen.

467
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:45,685
And you got eggs.

468
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:47,382
How do you like your eggs?

469
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:49,155
- Scrambled.
- Of course.

470
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:51,558
Men love scrambled.

471
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:52,755
I didn't know that.

472
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:54,834
Men love scrambled.

473
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:05,301
Does the window open?

474
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,615
No, I'm real sorry.
It's painted shut.

475
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:12,013
Makes sense, doesn't it?
That's where the fire escape is.

476
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:16,083
Is there a vent or a fan or anything?

477
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,384
Sorry, that room catches
all the heat in the morning.

478
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:21,090
It's okay.

479
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,962
Well, you know...

480
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,433
...it's worse in the summer.

481
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:36,099
My God!

482
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:37,998
I'll put my robe back on.

483
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:39,744
No, no, don't!

484
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,008
What I mean is...

485
00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:45,650
...that you should be comfortable.

486
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:47,249
I am.

487
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,382
I'll get that.

488
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:55,423
It's probably for me.

489
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,530
Why'd you call?

490
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:05,868
What's the matter?

491
00:38:06,771 --> 00:38:08,237
You ate what?

492
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:10,962
That's okay.
Just don't do it again.

493
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:14,806
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm not doing anything.

494
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:18,010
Of course I sound strange
if you call me...

495
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:21,651
...and you say what am I doing,
and I'm not doing anything!

496
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,745
Oh, my God.

497
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:26,349
I just stepped on a tack.

498
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:29,449
I love you too.

499
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:31,921
Eggs coming right up.

500
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:36,195
I was thinking about
the last time that we were together.

501
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,988
And I was wondering...

502
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,966
...have you been able to find a....

503
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:42,636
A pimp?

504
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:45,270
I have to, though.

505
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:47,630
This way's too dangerous.

506
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:49,741
Lupe, she's my friend.

507
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:52,613
She got her arm broke last week.

508
00:38:53,682 --> 00:38:55,808
What a sick world!

509
00:38:56,015 --> 00:38:57,575
Yeah. Thank God.

510
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:05,081
We could do this every morning.

511
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:07,858
At least until
you get tired of eggs.

512
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:13,898
Boy, it is hot in here.

513
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,470
You got any bread?

514
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,469
I must have left my money at home.

515
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,302
It's in my other pants, I think.

516
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:26,739
There you go.

517
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:29,005
$4.90 out of $5?
Keep the dime.

518
00:39:29,215 --> 00:39:31,045
That's all right.
I'll take these.

519
00:39:35,452 --> 00:39:37,284
They gave me the wrong bread.

520
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:40,151
- I asked for wheat, I got white.
- Send it back.

521
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:42,553
- You gave him white bread.
- Don't make a fuss.

522
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:45,559
My mother said, you send it back,
the chef spits on it.

523
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:47,697
Turkeys!
Come and get your turkeys.

524
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,331
Immoral?

525
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:52,092
What do you mean, immoral?

526
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:54,931
As a matter of fact,
prostitution is probably...

527
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,665
...one of the most
moral things in the world.

528
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:00,002
How'd you figure that out?

529
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,144
Simple. You take a guy.

530
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,677
He's in from out of town.
Let's say that guy.

531
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:06,713
He's in from out of town.
He's here on business.

532
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:09,182
He's away from his wife
and 2.3 children.

533
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:14,347
He's got urges. Let's say he
goes in to see this picture.

534
00:40:14,556 --> 00:40:16,252
Which, by the way,
is not a bad movie.

535
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:18,221
Anyway, let's say this picture...

536
00:40:18,428 --> 00:40:19,521
...stimulates his....

537
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:20,559
Urges.

538
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:22,327
Good word.

539
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:25,159
Now he's out on the
street again, right?

540
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,232
He is a loaded pistol!
He's like Mount St. Helens.

541
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:29,303
Who walks by...

542
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:31,665
...but a Girl Scout
swinging her cookies?

543
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:33,775
Girl Scouts of America.
He goes bananas.

544
00:40:33,977 --> 00:40:35,533
He's on her like mud on a pig.

545
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,713
That wouldn't have happened if
he'd gone to a hooker, right?

546
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,710
So you call that moral?
He goes and jumps on a Girl Scout...

547
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:44,544
...and breaks her cookies
and you call that moral?

548
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:49,211
You figured that all out
just by yourself?

549
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,017
- I have that kind of mind.
- Yes, you do.

550
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,394
So let's do it!

551
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,298
Okay, now?

552
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah, nice.

553
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,896
But isn't this a little high, Angelo?

554
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:05,799
That's the way I always do it.

555
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,031
You like it that way.

556
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:08,468
I do?

557
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,302
All right, I do.

558
00:41:11,145 --> 00:41:12,109
How you doing?

559
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,540
You getting a haircut?

560
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:16,079
No, I just like wearing sheets.

561
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:18,944
Look at this. Did I tell you?
"Girl Scout Attacked!"

562
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,140
In the paper.

563
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,615
Could I see that again?

564
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:23,877
Right there.
"Girl Scout Attacked!"

565
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,881
"Girl Scout Attacked By Dog."

566
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:29,251
Dog. Guy from out of town.
What's the difference?

567
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:30,518
There's a difference.

568
00:41:30,728 --> 00:41:33,290
One carries an attaché case.
The other urinates on a tree.

569
00:41:33,499 --> 00:41:36,590
What are you doing? What is this?
A haircut? You call that--

570
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,029
Even these sideburns out!

571
00:41:38,236 --> 00:41:41,000
The man has a razor in his hand.
Let us not get him angry.

572
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:43,332
One sideburn's up here.
The other's in Fort Lauderdale.

573
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:45,442
He is a seasoned professional.

574
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:48,942
Do you want Belinda
working for one of those animals?

575
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:51,513
You want her to be
Miss Heroin 1982?

576
00:41:52,382 --> 00:41:54,542
Charlotte's parents are
coming in for Thanksgiving.

577
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:56,844
I really need to get this haircut.

578
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,386
That's it, get the haircut!

579
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:04,116
Get all your hair cut.

580
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:08,692
You only think about yourself.
You don't care what happens to me!

581
00:42:08,898 --> 00:42:10,492
Or what happens to Belinda!

582
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:14,033
You don't care about what happens to
the Girl Scouts of America!

583
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:16,002
I'm fed up, man!

584
00:42:16,205 --> 00:42:18,069
I'm fed up with you!

585
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,600
I wash my hands
and my feet of you!

586
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:24,970
Trim that!

587
00:42:31,787 --> 00:42:34,016
Mr. and Mrs. Koogle,
would you like a drink?

588
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:36,154
Mrs. Koogle and I do not drink.

589
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:38,018
Of course.

590
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:43,989
So how do you like
our fair city?

591
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,724
We don't.

592
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:48,362
Perhaps if you drank you would.

593
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,834
Mom, is dinner almost ready?

594
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:58,201
Turkey's almost dead.

595
00:43:04,784 --> 00:43:07,184
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving.

596
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:10,380
- Arrested?
- I'm really sorry.

597
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,022
I called the landlady
and she wasn't home.

598
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,028
They're taking me to night court.
My ID and money are in my apartment.

599
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,766
This is not a good evening.

600
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,460
My entire family
is here for Thanksgiving.

601
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:27,968
Please!

602
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,697
Franklin used to take
care of all these things.

603
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,672
I don't know what they're
going to do to me.

604
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,646
Don't cry.

605
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:38,347
I'll be there as soon as
I can get there.

606
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,880
Thanks.

607
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,516
Thanks a lot.

608
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,584
Have you seen the lights on at night?

609
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,554
No wonder this city's going broke!

610
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:54,790
I have to go out and I'll be back
in a minute, okay?

611
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:57,262
What? Where are you going?

612
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:12,434
You didn't have to come with me.
I would've been home in 10 minutes.

613
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:15,309
We paid for the rental car,
might as well use it.

614
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:17,041
You want to excuse me, sonny?

615
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:19,344
I want to know why she called you.

616
00:44:19,555 --> 00:44:21,681
She's my neighbor.

617
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:23,323
Excuse me.

618
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:26,926
The district attorney has
no objections...

619
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:29,322
...so if you like,
I think we can proceed.

620
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:30,758
Next case.

621
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:37,736
That's his neighbor.

622
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:48,410
Belinda Keaton, you're charged
with prostitution and assault.

623
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:50,310
Not guilty, your honor.

624
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:52,006
- Not guilty?
- Not guilty!

625
00:44:52,218 --> 00:44:54,346
Not guilty!
Your honor, this woman is a menace!

626
00:44:54,554 --> 00:44:57,215
You are one Howard Pelekoudas?

627
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:59,015
Yes, sir.
I'm the victim.

628
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:00,691
You're an asshole!

629
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:04,793
Be that as it may...

630
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:07,090
...can we proceed?

631
00:45:07,734 --> 00:45:10,328
Mr. Pelekoudas and I
had just completed...

632
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:12,331
...a business transaction.

633
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:17,136
At which point, Mr.Pelekoudas
attempted to forcibly exact a refund...

634
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,971
...when services had
already been rendered.

635
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,542
He tried to grab
his money back?

636
00:45:22,113 --> 00:45:24,204
Yes! That's when she assaulted me.

637
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:26,717
You look unmarked...

638
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,818
...undamaged to me in any manner.

639
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,417
Oh, yeah?

640
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:36,186
Feast your eyes on this!

641
00:45:37,761 --> 00:45:38,592
Exhibit "A"!

642
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,894
She bit me!

643
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,496
What about my feelings?

644
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,576
You want to know what
really steams my bean?

645
00:45:54,911 --> 00:45:57,344
They let that strumpet
right back out on the street.

646
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,448
You're moving out of that building.

647
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,376
Why are you friends with that girl?

648
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:02,516
She's my neighbor!

649
00:46:02,717 --> 00:46:04,241
She happens to be a very nice girl.

650
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:05,441
She's a harlot.

651
00:46:05,653 --> 00:46:07,954
- Wait a minute--
- You stay out of it!

652
00:46:08,158 --> 00:46:10,090
Let me tell you,
when you get married...

653
00:46:10,293 --> 00:46:13,556
...you'll have to handle him
just the way I handled his father.

654
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,359
Damn potholes!

655
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:18,123
You all right, Rose?

656
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:21,062
If not for me, his father
would've done as he pleased.

657
00:46:21,268 --> 00:46:23,499
You know what he wanted to do?
Make furniture.

658
00:46:23,706 --> 00:46:25,294
By hand!

659
00:46:25,705 --> 00:46:28,106
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Koogle.
I straightened out Al...

660
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:30,902
...and together we'll all
straighten out Chuck.

661
00:46:33,346 --> 00:46:35,247
You all right, Rose?

662
00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:01,535
Hey! My bud!

663
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:03,570
I have to talk to you.
It's important.

664
00:47:03,774 --> 00:47:05,140
Come on in.

665
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:07,311
How'd you get in?

666
00:47:07,512 --> 00:47:08,843
This is a security building.

667
00:47:09,046 --> 00:47:11,140
I'm going to have to
talk to that guy.

668
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,478
Way to go!

669
00:47:20,858 --> 00:47:23,123
What are we really
talking about here?

670
00:47:24,828 --> 00:47:26,797
What's the essence...

671
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:29,027
...of what we're talking about?

672
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:32,096
I'll spell it out for you
if I have to.

673
00:47:39,308 --> 00:47:40,970
Prostitution!

674
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:42,676
Cut it out!

675
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:44,242
What is this?

676
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,681
Prostitution.

677
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,176
We can say it.

678
00:47:48,384 --> 00:47:50,043
We're big kids now, right?

679
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:53,153
Sometimes it helps you understand
a word if you break it down.

680
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:55,346
So let's do that now.
Shall we?

681
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:56,922
PROS--

682
00:47:57,126 --> 00:47:59,094
Doesn't mean anything.
Forget about that.

683
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:01,789
TIT. I think we all know
what that means.

684
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:04,020
TU-- Okay, TU.

685
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:05,663
And --TION, of course...

686
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:07,696
...from the Latin...

687
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:10,432
..."to shun."

688
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:13,494
To say, "No thank you, anyway.
I don't want it."

689
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:15,105
"To push away."

690
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,674
Doesn't even belong here.
Let's get rid of it.

691
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,313
You know...

692
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,680
...if I can take a moment here...

693
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:27,010
...and I mean this...

694
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,344
...what I'm about to say.

695
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:30,520
I feel a lot of love
in this room.

696
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,195
Maybe it's me, but I tell you,
it was here a minute ago.

697
00:48:36,397 --> 00:48:38,727
And it was really beautiful.

698
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,197
So at this moment it's important
that I see all of your breasts.

699
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:45,496
Or I don't have to see your breasts.

700
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:48,697
Let's get out of here.
This guy's no pimp. He's a wimp!

701
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:50,966
Come on, you guys!
Give him a chance.

702
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:53,003
Is this a joke?

703
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:55,804
You're missing <i>The Donahue Show.</i>
I had you on the show.

704
00:48:56,014 --> 00:48:56,879
Booked!

705
00:48:57,948 --> 00:49:01,077
You've got to tell them.
Just tell them like you told me.

706
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:02,910
Get out of here.

707
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:05,018
Let's go.
We wasted enough time.

708
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:10,762
How would you ladies like to earn
10 times what you earn now?

709
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:14,256
I'm not kidding.

710
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:18,226
Ten times the amount of money
that you earn right now.

711
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:21,499
You want to use the blackboard?

712
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,808
You know, you're absolutely right.

713
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,800
We're not pimps.

714
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:33,546
If I understand it correctly...

715
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,116
...pimps make 70...

716
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,215
...80, 90 percent...

717
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:38,443
...of your money, right?

718
00:49:39,522 --> 00:49:42,046
You work very hard for
that money, don't you?

719
00:49:42,557 --> 00:49:45,460
Then please think of
William and myself...

720
00:49:45,661 --> 00:49:46,923
...as business managers.

721
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,721
As agents, if you will.
We're only interested...

722
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:51,864
...in 10 percent of your money.

723
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:52,929
Ten percent?

724
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:54,965
Leave him alone. He's doing fine.

725
00:49:57,672 --> 00:49:59,607
And ladies, I have a knack.

726
00:49:59,808 --> 00:50:02,331
I can take money and I can
make it into more money.

727
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,032
- Oh, boy!
- More money?

728
00:50:04,244 --> 00:50:07,146
Why shouldn't you have
the fruits of your labor?

729
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:10,280
Why should you be cheated and beaten?

730
00:50:11,752 --> 00:50:13,217
Do you have a dental plan?

731
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:15,116
Do you have a health plan?

732
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:18,586
If you come with us, we'd like
to give you a sound foundation.

733
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:20,623
A financial foundation.

734
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:23,160
And if you don't come with us,
I understand.

735
00:50:23,364 --> 00:50:25,262
Thank you very much for listening.

736
00:50:25,464 --> 00:50:27,159
No! Wait a minute.

737
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:29,962
That was great!

738
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:33,938
What do you think?
You think this guy's legit?

739
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:38,941
Wait, these guys are snowing us!
You know that.

740
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:40,941
This is too easy.

741
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,776
You should've pushed a little more.

742
00:50:44,984 --> 00:50:46,677
I did the best I could.

743
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:49,345
Okay, are we going to do this?

744
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,653
We're all yours!

745
00:50:54,325 --> 00:50:55,759
You pushed just enough.
You--

746
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:58,986
Right up to it and then you laid back.
That's perfect.

747
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:06,564
We'll get to have
them all too, sexually.

748
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:48,120
How you doing? I am cooking like
Betty Crocker tonight!

749
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:49,220
I get any calls?

750
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:53,591
Lupe called.
She's finished with Mr. Culpepper.

751
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,589
She's now with Mr. Jergens.

752
00:53:56,796 --> 00:53:58,389
Marlene just called.

753
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:01,193
She has a date with a young man.
She wants you to take her.

754
00:54:01,602 --> 00:54:03,727
Good. I got a couple of minutes.

755
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:06,430
What are you doing?

756
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:10,141
We don't want our girls getting
beaten up by any of those bozos.

757
00:54:10,344 --> 00:54:12,539
So if we run into them,
they'll see muscles.

758
00:54:12,747 --> 00:54:15,270
- And these are them?
- Yeah. It's working, right?

759
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,071
Business is going great.

760
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:18,578
I suppose so.

761
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:20,281
So what's wrong?

762
00:54:21,054 --> 00:54:23,452
Ever since we started this,
I have been ill.

763
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:25,323
I have headaches...

764
00:54:25,524 --> 00:54:27,787
...stomachaches.
I get the chills.

765
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,352
My gums are bleeding.

766
00:54:29,593 --> 00:54:32,029
And my hair keeps falling out
into the sink.

767
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:33,196
So?

768
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:37,401
Let me try to explain this to you.

769
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:39,927
As we sit here and idly chat...

770
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:41,195
...there are women...

771
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:42,964
...female human beings...

772
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:46,337
...rolling around in strange beds
with strange men...

773
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:48,944
...and we are making money from that.

774
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:51,339
Is this a great country or what?

775
00:54:52,516 --> 00:54:53,811
Look at this.

776
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:55,549
This is hair.

777
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,482
This is hair that used to be
in my head. See?

778
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,214
The same thing happened when
I worked on Wall Street.

779
00:55:02,425 --> 00:55:04,483
I had to wear a hat,
sitting at my desk.

780
00:55:06,163 --> 00:55:07,857
This is Bill. Mission in life:

781
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:10,226
Make Chuck a man!

782
00:55:11,967 --> 00:55:13,559
What am I now, a duck?

783
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,561
You're unbelievable.

784
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:18,763
You are something else, pal.

785
00:55:19,308 --> 00:55:21,402
You are some kind of guy.

786
00:55:28,048 --> 00:55:29,514
Impress the girls.

787
00:55:35,322 --> 00:55:36,882
Corn dog.

788
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:40,691
Bill, I'm back!

789
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:53,237
William.

790
00:56:15,293 --> 00:56:16,725
New guy!

791
00:56:25,938 --> 00:56:27,267
Help!

792
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:44,017
New record!

793
00:56:49,193 --> 00:56:50,181
I got it!

794
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:56,988
I could have done it!

795
00:56:57,199 --> 00:56:58,029
He called me!

796
00:56:58,233 --> 00:57:00,134
Now you've gone over the line!

797
00:57:00,336 --> 00:57:02,530
Hold on a minute.
Get the chug-party goodies!

798
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:03,837
Go home!

799
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:04,870
Go home!

800
00:57:05,074 --> 00:57:09,338
Remember that kid I took to the party?
This is his fraternity.

801
00:57:09,544 --> 00:57:10,944
So what?

802
00:57:11,413 --> 00:57:12,972
He's the greatest!

803
00:57:13,616 --> 00:57:16,582
They can't have girls in the dorm.
So I brought them here, group rate.

804
00:57:16,784 --> 00:57:18,080
They let me in the fraternity.

805
00:57:18,286 --> 00:57:20,551
You've got to ask them to get out!
Please!

806
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:21,722
My brothers?!

807
00:57:21,923 --> 00:57:25,723
- What's wrong with you?!
- Carboni will fire me! That's what!

808
00:57:25,928 --> 00:57:27,290
It's college high jinks!

809
00:57:27,493 --> 00:57:28,482
It's not high jinks.

810
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,859
Remember the pain in my gums and hair?
It's moved to my chest.

811
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:34,057
A young man shouldn't have
pains in his chest!

812
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,964
You got to learn how to live!
How to have fun! How to be a man!

813
00:57:38,172 --> 00:57:39,364
Radical!

814
00:57:39,572 --> 00:57:41,039
Let's get radical!

815
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:46,937
Come on, what the...?

816
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:49,048
Bummer! I am bummed right out!

817
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,908
Get out of here!

818
00:57:56,688 --> 00:57:57,815
That's better.

819
00:58:00,024 --> 00:58:02,325
I don't know about you people.

820
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:04,151
This is a morgue.

821
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,990
You're partying in a morgue.

822
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,828
You don't believe me?

823
00:58:09,034 --> 00:58:11,559
Let's go take a look at
rigor mortis in room 12.

824
00:58:12,504 --> 00:58:14,697
This'll bring you back to reality.

825
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:17,171
I want you all to see this.

826
00:58:19,378 --> 00:58:21,538
So that's what it's like!

827
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:24,910
Jefferey pulled one down!

828
00:58:38,363 --> 00:58:41,228
That very moment they all
jumped in the drawers.

829
00:58:41,429 --> 00:58:42,396
Yeah, I heard.

830
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:44,690
You're not shocked by that?

831
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:48,670
How could people do it
in a morgue?

832
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:50,928
How could people do it
in the drawers?

833
00:58:51,138 --> 00:58:53,267
- It's new.
- It's sick!

834
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:56,709
Everybody's looking for
a new way to do it.

835
00:58:56,912 --> 00:59:00,007
A guy once took me up
in a helicopter.

836
00:59:00,782 --> 00:59:01,943
Had me do it...

837
00:59:02,151 --> 00:59:03,081
...with him...

838
00:59:03,284 --> 00:59:06,015
...as we hovered over
his ex-wife's house.

839
00:59:09,657 --> 00:59:12,593
Don't you ever fantasize different
ways you want to do it?

840
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:18,953
Once I'd like to do it
without checking the apartment first.

841
00:59:19,399 --> 00:59:20,457
What?

842
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,125
Nothing.

843
00:59:41,987 --> 00:59:44,684
- This is nice, huh?
- Nice.

844
00:59:45,692 --> 00:59:47,785
Practically drives itself.

845
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,862
Can you turn down the music?

846
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,164
Can you turn the music down?

847
00:59:57,435 --> 00:59:59,200
I can turn it down.
I can turn it up.

848
00:59:59,405 --> 01:00:01,668
I can switch it from
the back to the front.

849
01:00:01,873 --> 01:00:05,206
- I can make it reverberate. I--
- Can you turn it down?

850
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:07,878
Thank you.

851
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,411
Look at this dash.
Solid gold.

852
01:00:11,048 --> 01:00:12,676
Look at this carpeting.
Fur.

853
01:00:12,884 --> 01:00:14,782
- Check out these windows!
- Glass?

854
01:00:14,985 --> 01:00:16,247
Glass. Yeah.

855
01:00:16,452 --> 01:00:18,819
But we can see out
and nobody can see in.

856
01:00:19,188 --> 01:00:20,156
Watch.

857
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,392
Watch, okay? Here we go.

858
01:00:24,562 --> 01:00:25,789
Hey, you! Right here!

859
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,222
Right here, buddy!

860
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:30,763
Look at this!

861
01:00:31,267 --> 01:00:34,725
We got teenage girls!
The place is full of broads in here!

862
01:00:39,975 --> 01:00:41,671
Go! Roger!

863
01:00:41,877 --> 01:00:43,173
Roger, officer!

864
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:44,811
Is this great or what?

865
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,210
You ought to get one, man.
This is great.

866
01:00:49,418 --> 01:00:51,044
Everything's automatic too.

867
01:00:51,387 --> 01:00:54,048
You can pop the trunk from here.
Don't have to move.

868
01:00:57,792 --> 01:01:01,285
You should get one. What do you do
with all your money, anyway?

869
01:01:01,497 --> 01:01:02,589
You know...

870
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:05,432
...I'd like to talk to you about that.

871
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:07,927
I have this feeling
something's very wrong.

872
01:01:08,135 --> 01:01:10,001
We're this close from
getting caught.

873
01:01:10,371 --> 01:01:12,737
Know what? It's my fault
you're the way you are.

874
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:16,670
I promised I'd show you around
and I haven't. It's my fault.

875
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:17,809
Listen.

876
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:21,004
Today it starts, all right?
Operation Chuck.

877
01:01:21,214 --> 01:01:23,204
From now on we'll have some
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

878
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:25,886
<i>Till her daddy takes her T-Bird away</i>
All right?

879
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:28,713
When I'm done with you,
you'll be a walking Mardi Gras.

880
01:01:28,921 --> 01:01:33,220
I won't even be able to control you.
You'll be an insane cowboy.

881
01:01:35,563 --> 01:01:37,119
Come on, ladies.

882
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,958
Chuckie, dollface...

883
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,635
...I don't have to eat in dives
like this no more!

884
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:49,539
Come on, don't be snobs.

885
01:01:49,743 --> 01:01:53,005
I used to be the pickle girl
here once.

886
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,271
Lupe used to be the pickle girl.

887
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:58,210
Lupe, you now own the pickles!

888
01:01:58,416 --> 01:02:00,112
Say what?

889
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:03,479
Ladies, I'm pleased to announce
to each and everyone of you...

890
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:07,053
...that you are the proud owner
of this particular Burger Steak.

891
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:11,127
Remember, sign the contracts.

892
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:12,883
Sign them!

893
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,160
This is wonderful.

894
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,368
Thank you.

895
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:33,739
Somebody's taken over
Franklin's business...

896
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,679
...and we're not seeing
a damn dime of it.

897
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,612
All right!
Let me see if I can....

898
01:02:40,554 --> 01:02:42,022
Can't you see we're talking?

899
01:02:42,222 --> 01:02:46,183
We know Franklin's girls. We'll find
out who's running their action.

900
01:02:46,394 --> 01:02:49,886
Then we'll bury him and put in
our own man, okay?

901
01:02:50,365 --> 01:02:51,955
This guy's had enough.

902
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:59,636
And next time watch out
whose car you sit on!

903
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:03,739
Hi, you guys!
Come on over by the Christmas tree.

904
01:03:06,213 --> 01:03:07,405
Come on.

905
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:13,085
Misters Chuckie and Bill...

906
01:03:13,287 --> 01:03:15,413
...we have something to say to you...

907
01:03:15,623 --> 01:03:18,112
...so I have been elected
the spokesperson.

908
01:03:24,097 --> 01:03:26,497
<i>You take us off the city streets...</i>

909
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:28,893
<i>...and give us nicer mens to meets</i>

910
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:32,935
<i>We have furs and jewels
and nicer dresses to wear</i>

911
01:03:33,439 --> 01:03:36,804
<i>And we even go to Vidal Sassoon's
to fix up our hair</i>

912
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:41,834
<i>We move to nice apartment houses...</i>

913
01:03:42,046 --> 01:03:45,777
<i>...instead of living
with the </i>ratones<i> and the mouses</i>

914
01:03:45,983 --> 01:03:46,881
<i>Because of you...</i>

915
01:03:47,085 --> 01:03:48,949
<i>...our joy is jumping</i>

916
01:03:49,154 --> 01:03:50,587
<i>Because we at this party...</i>

917
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,153
<i>...instead of humping</i>

918
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:03,690
Check this out, Jack!

919
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:05,861
Radical!

920
01:04:08,372 --> 01:04:10,703
A new tape recorder!

921
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:13,669
I was going to get one.
But this one's better...

922
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:15,368
...because I didn't
have to pay for it.

923
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:18,708
Okay, Chuck, you're next.

924
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:20,706
I love presents.

925
01:04:26,723 --> 01:04:27,916
Ladies, it's amazing.

926
01:04:28,122 --> 01:04:31,250
You've hit upon the one thing
I've always wanted.

927
01:04:37,398 --> 01:04:38,833
Wear it, baby.

928
01:04:54,879 --> 01:04:57,042
Okay, there you go, Joe.

929
01:04:57,252 --> 01:04:59,617
Okay, Pete, here's some wine.

930
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,446
So...

931
01:05:02,657 --> 01:05:04,520
...my father told me...

932
01:05:04,757 --> 01:05:06,815
...that I'd never amount
to anything, right?

933
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,319
Fathers get that way.

934
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,127
Yeah, well, he told me that
when I was four.

935
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:15,535
I'm serious. I know.

936
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:17,665
Then when I was 13...

937
01:05:18,236 --> 01:05:19,100
...he left.

938
01:05:19,304 --> 01:05:21,830
He's out of there. He's gone.
History. Right?

939
01:05:23,342 --> 01:05:26,277
Told me and my mom we were
too ugly to look at.

940
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,810
In my case, he was wrong.

941
01:05:30,747 --> 01:05:32,513
No, I mean, my mom....

942
01:05:33,586 --> 01:05:36,076
My mom used to be real pretty.

943
01:05:41,892 --> 01:05:44,325
You live with a lunatic
and it does things to you.

944
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:51,033
This is Bill.

945
01:05:55,371 --> 01:05:58,035
Call your mom,
wish her a Merry Christmas.

946
01:06:06,449 --> 01:06:07,642
This guy...

947
01:06:08,817 --> 01:06:09,716
...doesn't have fun.

948
01:06:09,919 --> 01:06:14,049
I'm going to teach this wild man
how to have fun right now.

949
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:17,987
We making loads of cash.
He doesn't spend any of his money.

950
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,126
I spent some.

951
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:21,397
On what?

952
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:25,259
Are you really interested
to see what I spent it on?

953
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,081
<i>And a partridge in a pear tree</i>

954
01:06:47,088 --> 01:06:48,418
Are we getting out here?

955
01:06:48,622 --> 01:06:50,522
Oh, wait! Wait!

956
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:51,987
Come on.

957
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,285
What is--

958
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:59,123
- This is what you bought?
- Chuck, wait!

959
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:00,891
A cemetery.

960
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,457
Wait a minute, will you?

961
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:05,500
You know what?

962
01:07:05,703 --> 01:07:07,672
This might not be a bad idea.

963
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,603
Because you know...

964
01:07:10,743 --> 01:07:12,302
...people got to die, right?

965
01:07:12,512 --> 01:07:14,536
Why can't they just die for us?

966
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:18,571
We just sit back and rake it in.
Chuck and Bill's Cemetery.

967
01:07:18,816 --> 01:07:20,579
This one's full.

968
01:07:21,153 --> 01:07:22,882
Should've bought an empty one.

969
01:07:28,258 --> 01:07:30,351
You wanted to see what I bought.

970
01:07:40,337 --> 01:07:41,201
Your father?

971
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:45,238
He used to have the smallest stone
in the whole place.

972
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,071
Not anymore.

973
01:07:54,483 --> 01:07:56,973
This is what you spent
your money on?

974
01:07:57,454 --> 01:07:59,080
He's my dad.

975
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:08,788
It takes a while
for the heat to come up.

976
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:11,592
I know.
It'll be up by spring.

977
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:22,838
You know, my father's alive
and I don't buy him anything.

978
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:27,471
You're like a saint.

979
01:08:28,682 --> 01:08:31,741
Because I bought my father
a headstone?

980
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:33,280
Saint Chuck.

981
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:35,581
Not just for that.

982
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:37,791
You're nice.

983
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:42,921
Decent.

984
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,600
You think I'm decent?

985
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:07,215
Remember the first time
you made me eggs in my apartment?

986
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:11,555
And you took off your robe?

987
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,986
My eyes had a heart attack.

988
01:09:18,595 --> 01:09:20,655
And every time after that...

989
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:23,164
...it didn't matter
what you were wearing.

990
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:26,501
You could've worn
a suit of armor.

991
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,603
I got hot and crazy.

992
01:09:29,272 --> 01:09:30,637
There's your Saint Chuck.

993
01:09:33,879 --> 01:09:36,402
It's 30 degrees in here
and I am sweating.

994
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:43,018
I think we'll skip the coffee.
I'm sober.

995
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,420
I'm sober too.
And I have to talk to you.

996
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:54,153
- What about?
- About this.

997
01:10:02,105 --> 01:10:04,131
You're a very good talker.

998
01:10:45,644 --> 01:10:47,909
The zipper's on the side, honey.

999
01:10:48,349 --> 01:10:49,474
I got it.

1000
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:37,056
Want to know something funny?

1001
01:11:38,095 --> 01:11:39,995
I don't smoke.

1002
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,906
Did you ever see the movie, <i>Klute</i>?

1003
01:11:58,114 --> 01:11:59,102
What?

1004
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:01,578
The movie with Jane Fonda, <i>Klute.</i>

1005
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:03,773
No, I don't think so.

1006
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:07,377
She plays a call girl.

1007
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:09,980
And she's with this guy,
you know?

1008
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:11,724
A customer.

1009
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,625
And they're doing it,
and she's screaming and moaning...

1010
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:18,956
...as if it's, like,
the end of the world for her.

1011
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:23,503
And then, right in the middle,
when the guy's not looking...

1012
01:12:23,704 --> 01:12:25,763
...she looks at her watch...

1013
01:12:26,507 --> 01:12:29,031
...and you just know it's an act.

1014
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:37,348
I don't wear a watch.

1015
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:00,968
Where you been?

1016
01:13:01,472 --> 01:13:02,701
We moved.

1017
01:13:03,107 --> 01:13:05,097
<i>William, it's so nice to see you</i>

1018
01:13:05,308 --> 01:13:07,469
<i>At nine o'clock this evening</i>

1019
01:13:11,884 --> 01:13:13,405
You're drunk from last night.

1020
01:13:14,351 --> 01:13:16,251
Drunk, yes. But not from wine.

1021
01:13:16,588 --> 01:13:17,677
Beer.

1022
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,893
What is it with you? You're late!
It's been mayhem in here!

1023
01:13:24,094 --> 01:13:26,426
I got stiffs coming in,
I got girls going out.

1024
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,324
Where's Belinda?
She hasn't checked in.

1025
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,460
I would not count on Belinda
coming back to work.

1026
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,727
What happened? Is she all right?
Did somebody rough her up?

1027
01:13:34,938 --> 01:13:36,837
Nobody roughed her up.

1028
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:39,699
Will you put away your muscles?

1029
01:13:41,845 --> 01:13:44,107
Something happened last night.

1030
01:13:44,846 --> 01:13:47,213
Something passed between us.

1031
01:13:47,983 --> 01:13:51,078
Her life couldn't possibly be the same.

1032
01:13:53,553 --> 01:13:55,282
Sorry I'm late. Hi, Chuck!

1033
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:05,262
Remember that guy, Schisselman?
He called and he wants to meet you.

1034
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:07,325
He's nice.

1035
01:14:10,337 --> 01:14:11,363
What are you doing?

1036
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,971
What do you mean, what's she doing?
She's working.

1037
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:17,834
Is that true?

1038
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:22,039
Really?

1039
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,908
I have to earn a living, right?

1040
01:14:30,588 --> 01:14:33,022
You told me this morning
you weren't faking.

1041
01:14:35,962 --> 01:14:37,292
I wasn't faking.

1042
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:38,496
Faking what?

1043
01:14:38,965 --> 01:14:39,895
Please, Bill.

1044
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:41,827
Get out of town!

1045
01:14:42,099 --> 01:14:43,691
You two guys?

1046
01:14:43,902 --> 01:14:45,928
Can I please have
a conversation with her?

1047
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:51,399
You haven't quit?

1048
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:55,578
How can I quit?

1049
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,905
Very simply. You open your mouth
and say, "Bill, Chuck...

1050
01:14:59,117 --> 01:15:00,276
...I quit."

1051
01:15:00,785 --> 01:15:02,810
Okay. And then what do I do?

1052
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:07,147
No, I mean it!

1053
01:15:07,356 --> 01:15:08,914
Where do I go from there?

1054
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,616
What happens to me?

1055
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,299
What happens to you is....

1056
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:27,243
I can't get over the fact
that you didn't quit.

1057
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:29,201
Right!

1058
01:15:29,711 --> 01:15:31,007
I didn't quit!

1059
01:15:31,212 --> 01:15:32,237
Did you quit?

1060
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:33,573
I'm not a whore!

1061
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:36,717
No, you're a pimp!

1062
01:15:36,917 --> 01:15:39,387
Let's stop before we say
something we regret.

1063
01:15:39,589 --> 01:15:41,056
Shut up!

1064
01:15:43,157 --> 01:15:45,126
I need a ride.

1065
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:57,997
I have to drive her.

1066
01:15:58,405 --> 01:15:59,236
Fine.

1067
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:03,402
You'll be all right?

1068
01:16:04,814 --> 01:16:07,108
You know us pimps. Fine.

1069
01:16:09,783 --> 01:16:11,842
I need the car keys.
You got them?

1070
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,049
Thank you. I got them.

1071
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:49,144
- He didn't mean what he said.
- Yes, he did.

1072
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,377
No, he's....

1073
01:16:50,589 --> 01:16:52,683
He's a strange guy.

1074
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:56,324
He's not like you and me.
He probably thought...

1075
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:00,559
...you two were in love.

1076
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:04,056
So did I.

1077
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,212
Look...

1078
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:24,649
...you don't want to go up.

1079
01:17:28,325 --> 01:17:29,587
So I'll drive you home.

1080
01:17:30,824 --> 01:17:32,849
Wait. What about the trick?

1081
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,996
I'll come back later, get him drunk,
take off his clothes.

1082
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:38,258
In the morning,
he'll think you were there.

1083
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,258
No problem.

1084
01:17:59,618 --> 01:18:01,177
City Morgue.

1085
01:18:01,922 --> 01:18:03,947
Somebody died?

1086
01:18:04,724 --> 01:18:06,419
Who cares?

1087
01:18:18,702 --> 01:18:19,897
Why'd you lock the door?

1088
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:22,904
It's okay.

1089
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:28,809
Sirs?

1090
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,345
At least Franklin
paid off for two years.

1091
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:33,710
Until he got stupid.

1092
01:18:33,985 --> 01:18:35,920
You never even sent us a nickel.

1093
01:18:36,121 --> 01:18:37,349
Not one nickel.

1094
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,918
- I don't know--
- I don't, I don't know.

1095
01:18:43,127 --> 01:18:45,253
If you were up-front,
we could've worked it out.

1096
01:18:45,461 --> 01:18:46,985
But now it's too late.

1097
01:18:47,196 --> 01:18:48,562
We're angry.

1098
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:49,755
We're insulted.

1099
01:18:50,702 --> 01:18:54,295
Besides, wouldn't be right to let
you live after we killed Franklin.

1100
01:18:54,504 --> 01:18:55,699
He was our friend.

1101
01:18:56,706 --> 01:18:58,297
I'd like to be your friend.

1102
01:18:58,507 --> 01:19:00,568
Please, God!
Let me be your friend--

1103
01:19:25,767 --> 01:19:27,359
Come on, let's get out of here.

1104
01:19:27,568 --> 01:19:30,162
If we bust one bozo,
we got to bust the whole place.

1105
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:32,305
I hate Narcotics.

1106
01:19:32,506 --> 01:19:34,700
I wish they'd put us back on Vice.

1107
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,543
Could I have the check, please?

1108
01:19:37,012 --> 01:19:38,479
Pretty good beat, huh?

1109
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,976
Peachy.

1110
01:19:41,349 --> 01:19:43,212
I noticed you guys were...

1111
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:47,214
...unencumbered by
female companionship.

1112
01:19:50,892 --> 01:19:52,482
So how'd you like to get...

1113
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,854
...encumbered?

1114
01:19:57,394 --> 01:19:59,489
Okay, boys. Here we are.

1115
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:02,862
I wonder why that door's locked.

1116
01:20:04,203 --> 01:20:05,136
In the morgue?

1117
01:20:05,338 --> 01:20:07,931
I know what you're thinking.
Don't worry about it.

1118
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:11,702
It won't bother you if you don't think
about all those dead people.

1119
01:20:15,247 --> 01:20:18,545
Let me get my phone book.
It's got all my numbers in it.

1120
01:20:21,452 --> 01:20:23,112
I wonder where that book is.

1121
01:20:23,487 --> 01:20:25,980
Maybe my partner has it.
Follow me.

1122
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:30,952
You're about to become
one of the Great Lakes. Open up.

1123
01:20:31,162 --> 01:20:33,060
I said, open up!

1124
01:20:34,064 --> 01:20:35,827
Get ready to fill him up.

1125
01:20:36,268 --> 01:20:39,258
This is to make some holes
so the water comes out.

1126
01:20:44,742 --> 01:20:46,230
Again locked.

1127
01:20:54,618 --> 01:20:55,880
What's going on?

1128
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:58,176
Excuse me.

1129
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:00,019
Hold it! Police!

1130
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:03,785
You guys are police?

1131
01:21:09,695 --> 01:21:11,163
How could they be cops?

1132
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:16,968
I should have asked for an ID.

1133
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:37,889
Son of a bitch!

1134
01:21:38,092 --> 01:21:39,388
That's it!
Cool it! I quit!

1135
01:21:39,592 --> 01:21:40,958
You what?!

1136
01:21:41,428 --> 01:21:42,553
That's it, man!

1137
01:21:44,564 --> 01:21:45,689
Party's over, numb-nuts!

1138
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:49,028
Man, you blew it!

1139
01:21:49,236 --> 01:21:51,203
Let me hit him one time!

1140
01:22:02,948 --> 01:22:04,279
It's all over, buddy.

1141
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:06,173
Were you scared?

1142
01:22:06,717 --> 01:22:07,707
Were you?

1143
01:22:08,686 --> 01:22:10,175
Mostly dizzy.

1144
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:12,145
I tell you, you were great!

1145
01:22:12,357 --> 01:22:15,087
Guys were shooting over you
and you just laid there.

1146
01:22:15,293 --> 01:22:17,784
You never complained once.
I admire that.

1147
01:22:17,996 --> 01:22:20,861
- I have a great respect--
- Take off the tape.

1148
01:22:26,269 --> 01:22:27,827
Look up here.

1149
01:22:30,441 --> 01:22:32,203
Turn sideways.

1150
01:22:32,408 --> 01:22:33,874
Other way.

1151
01:22:38,748 --> 01:22:40,649
Okay, leave!

1152
01:22:44,152 --> 01:22:47,553
Somebody have a comb,
so I can just get ready?

1153
01:22:48,224 --> 01:22:50,088
I wasn't ready for that.

1154
01:22:50,493 --> 01:22:52,758
Just turn sideways.

1155
01:22:58,266 --> 01:22:59,256
Leave.

1156
01:23:00,469 --> 01:23:01,459
Today!

1157
01:23:04,839 --> 01:23:06,364
You're good at this game.

1158
01:23:06,575 --> 01:23:08,064
Last one.
Best of three.

1159
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:09,538
Even, shoot!

1160
01:23:10,878 --> 01:23:12,607
Great. Fair is fair.

1161
01:23:14,482 --> 01:23:16,176
We took a shot, right?

1162
01:23:16,952 --> 01:23:18,784
Can't hit a home run
unless you bat.

1163
01:23:18,986 --> 01:23:21,386
I wish I had a bat right now.

1164
01:23:22,021 --> 01:23:23,547
You had to bring the police?

1165
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:25,090
That's gratitude.

1166
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:28,090
If I didn't bring the police,
you'd be dead now.

1167
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:31,288
So? I'd be better off.
I'd rather be dead.

1168
01:23:31,496 --> 01:23:33,089
You want to be dead?

1169
01:23:36,937 --> 01:23:38,700
Do you want to be dead?

1170
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:45,940
You let me know
if you change your mind.

1171
01:23:46,144 --> 01:23:48,046
You'll be the first.

1172
01:23:49,616 --> 01:23:50,775
How you doing?

1173
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,582
That's great.

1174
01:23:56,788 --> 01:23:59,553
You get me in jail here
with Peter Lorre's son.

1175
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:04,692
"Oh, come on. We have to be pimps.
Let's be pimps."

1176
01:24:04,897 --> 01:24:06,956
We couldn't be doctors.

1177
01:24:15,506 --> 01:24:17,702
We were rolling there
for a while though.

1178
01:24:18,776 --> 01:24:20,969
Cash, clothes.

1179
01:24:21,812 --> 01:24:23,177
I'll tell you something.

1180
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:25,380
You couldn't do
what we did in Russia.

1181
01:24:25,582 --> 01:24:27,346
You know? Seriously.

1182
01:24:28,851 --> 01:24:31,081
- Russian pimp--
- Would you do me a favor?

1183
01:24:31,286 --> 01:24:33,847
Just leave me alone.

1184
01:24:39,061 --> 01:24:41,030
There's room for one more.

1185
01:24:56,811 --> 01:24:58,868
I thought you were in Indiana.

1186
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,844
My mom called.

1187
01:25:03,785 --> 01:25:06,618
And you flew all the way back here.

1188
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:09,980
I thought for sure when you
found out what I was doing...

1189
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,715
...you'd just hate me.

1190
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,389
No, not you.

1191
01:25:15,029 --> 01:25:16,757
You came to be by my side.

1192
01:25:17,765 --> 01:25:20,393
You are one in a million.

1193
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,140
Goodbye, Chuck.

1194
01:25:39,685 --> 01:25:40,981
Did you see that?

1195
01:25:41,622 --> 01:25:44,180
My fiancée just spit on me.

1196
01:25:44,688 --> 01:25:46,849
And after you were deloused.

1197
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:48,918
But she's right, you know.

1198
01:25:49,628 --> 01:25:51,460
I should be spit on.

1199
01:25:54,465 --> 01:25:56,957
He's got hair in his mouth.
What are you doing?

1200
01:25:57,167 --> 01:25:59,033
It looks bad in front
of the guys.

1201
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:02,034
So what? What am I running for,
cell president?

1202
01:26:04,475 --> 01:26:05,841
They have that?

1203
01:26:06,112 --> 01:26:08,168
This is a nightmare.

1204
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,780
You know what
the worst part about this is?

1205
01:26:11,981 --> 01:26:12,969
I'm guilty.

1206
01:26:13,182 --> 01:26:14,242
I am guilty.

1207
01:26:14,452 --> 01:26:17,546
You know what'll happen, don't you?
I'll lose my job.

1208
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:21,086
My life is over.

1209
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:23,253
Do you know...

1210
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,687
...at this moment...

1211
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:27,692
...I have sunk as low as I can go?

1212
01:26:35,069 --> 01:26:36,661
I was wrong.

1213
01:26:50,486 --> 01:26:52,543
Mimi, pay the cab driver, will you?

1214
01:26:52,752 --> 01:26:54,015
Move over!

1215
01:26:54,689 --> 01:26:55,986
With money!

1216
01:27:00,427 --> 01:27:01,622
No jail can hold us.

1217
01:27:01,862 --> 01:27:03,228
You got them out!

1218
01:27:03,431 --> 01:27:05,194
You bet your Puerto Rican ass I did!

1219
01:27:05,399 --> 01:27:07,060
Can't keep my men in there.

1220
01:27:07,268 --> 01:27:08,633
My life is over.

1221
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:10,535
Stay with him.
Take him home.

1222
01:27:10,737 --> 01:27:12,259
Get him to the lawyer's on time.

1223
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:13,301
Piece of cake!

1224
01:27:13,507 --> 01:27:16,704
We'll take you home,
we give you a nice bath.

1225
01:27:17,244 --> 01:27:18,405
Wait a minute.

1226
01:27:18,612 --> 01:27:19,839
I don't see Belinda here.

1227
01:27:20,045 --> 01:27:21,443
She don't want to come.

1228
01:27:21,647 --> 01:27:22,977
That's it!
Make him feel better.

1229
01:27:23,249 --> 01:27:24,877
You know what I mean.

1230
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:34,254
Will this take long or what?

1231
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,484
I have a tennis lesson
at one o'clock.

1232
01:27:36,694 --> 01:27:39,027
I already missed one
when we were in prison.

1233
01:27:39,231 --> 01:27:41,629
I see.
Can I get you anything?

1234
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:42,858
All right.

1235
01:27:44,035 --> 01:27:47,266
- Lamb chops--
- I was thinking of something to drink.

1236
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:50,373
Why don't we just get started?

1237
01:27:58,748 --> 01:28:00,375
Mr. Drollhauser...

1238
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,809
...are we going to prison?

1239
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:04,250
That's a good question.

1240
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:06,618
I hardly think so.

1241
01:28:07,223 --> 01:28:09,454
You see boys,
this is an election year...

1242
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,854
...and the party in power...

1243
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,324
...let's just say...

1244
01:28:13,529 --> 01:28:15,965
...they find the whole
situation embarrassing.

1245
01:28:17,132 --> 01:28:20,533
Therefore, it would be in the
best interest of all concerned...

1246
01:28:20,735 --> 01:28:23,101
...if they just gave you boys
your jobs back...

1247
01:28:23,304 --> 01:28:25,068
...and forgot the whole thing.

1248
01:28:26,008 --> 01:28:28,374
I assume that's okay with you.

1249
01:28:35,848 --> 01:28:37,316
Mr. Drollhauser...

1250
01:28:38,387 --> 01:28:40,685
...that's the greatest thing
I ever heard!

1251
01:28:40,887 --> 01:28:41,981
Thank you very much.

1252
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:43,657
That's fantastic!

1253
01:28:43,857 --> 01:28:45,552
Well, it's not okay with me!

1254
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,853
We got them over the barrel.

1255
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:51,331
As long as we do...

1256
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:54,126
...I say get something out of it.

1257
01:28:57,003 --> 01:28:58,833
Can I talk to him alone please?

1258
01:29:17,155 --> 01:29:19,283
I have thought about this...

1259
01:29:19,492 --> 01:29:21,756
...for the entire time in jail.

1260
01:29:22,395 --> 01:29:25,056
And what I want is to go back...

1261
01:29:25,262 --> 01:29:28,359
...to my old life, the way it was
before this craziness.

1262
01:29:28,568 --> 01:29:29,692
I want...

1263
01:29:29,901 --> 01:29:32,062
...my old life back.

1264
01:29:32,704 --> 01:29:34,069
Please, Bill.

1265
01:29:34,938 --> 01:29:37,100
Please let me have my old life back.

1266
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:47,445
If I did that, I'd never be able
to sleep with myself again.

1267
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:49,944
We are holding the cards.

1268
01:29:50,154 --> 01:29:52,281
They're afraid of us.

1269
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:54,252
You see the beauty here?

1270
01:29:55,392 --> 01:29:56,950
I say we go down there...

1271
01:29:57,161 --> 01:30:00,185
...and march into the mayor's office
and lay it on the line.

1272
01:30:00,397 --> 01:30:01,727
You want to?
It'll be fun.

1273
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:02,921
It'll be great.

1274
01:30:07,538 --> 01:30:09,129
I'm wearing white!

1275
01:30:16,346 --> 01:30:19,280
Get away from the door!
Get away from the door!

1276
01:30:19,482 --> 01:30:20,913
You won't see the mayor!

1277
01:30:21,116 --> 01:30:24,551
You won't make any demands
or I'm going to kill you!

1278
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,281
You'll play tennis...

1279
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:28,047
...with God!

1280
01:30:30,959 --> 01:30:33,425
Are you going to change your mind?

1281
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:39,928
Are you going to change your mind?

1282
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,663
You got to keep that elbow stiff.

1283
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:47,562
What's going on in there?

1284
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,339
My God!

1285
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,875
I could have you guys
executed for this!

1286
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:02,616
Call maintenance!

1287
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,380
Get them up here!

1288
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:09,160
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

1289
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,885
- Are you okay, Mr. Chuckie?
- I'm calm.

1290
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:13,155
I'm calm.

1291
01:31:13,365 --> 01:31:15,426
- I'm calm, I promise.
- Are you bleeding?

1292
01:31:15,801 --> 01:31:17,098
It's okay, girls.

1293
01:31:17,302 --> 01:31:18,234
You can let go.

1294
01:31:29,114 --> 01:31:32,277
Let me tell you something.
You listen to me, Mr. Idea Man.

1295
01:31:32,482 --> 01:31:34,178
I will go back to the morgue.

1296
01:31:34,385 --> 01:31:36,374
And I will put my life straight.

1297
01:31:36,587 --> 01:31:37,610
A life you ruined!

1298
01:31:37,821 --> 01:31:40,484
Everything that's bad
that happened to me, you did!

1299
01:31:40,992 --> 01:31:42,549
I don't want to see you anymore.

1300
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:44,854
I don't want to hear from you anymore.

1301
01:31:45,061 --> 01:31:47,620
I don't even want to hear rumors
about you anymore.

1302
01:31:47,829 --> 01:31:48,659
Here's an idea:

1303
01:31:48,865 --> 01:31:52,165
Get a ticket on the first
space shuttle and get out of here.

1304
01:31:52,603 --> 01:31:53,864
Excuse me.

1305
01:32:11,354 --> 01:32:12,182
How are you?

1306
01:32:15,758 --> 01:32:17,019
What have you been doing?

1307
01:32:17,292 --> 01:32:19,022
You mean, since jail?

1308
01:32:19,662 --> 01:32:20,991
I'm back to work.

1309
01:32:21,896 --> 01:32:23,294
Yeah, me too.

1310
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:24,931
I start a new job tonight.

1311
01:32:25,767 --> 01:32:27,132
Really, what are you doing?

1312
01:32:29,204 --> 01:32:33,001
It's the same thing I did before.
It's just in a different place.

1313
01:32:33,206 --> 01:32:35,470
Paradise Found, just off Sixth?

1314
01:32:35,975 --> 01:32:36,804
I've heard of it.

1315
01:32:37,011 --> 01:32:39,071
It's supposed to be real nice.

1316
01:32:43,484 --> 01:32:46,542
Look, I may not see you again.
I'm moving on Friday.

1317
01:32:49,623 --> 01:32:50,612
Condo.

1318
01:32:52,225 --> 01:32:53,657
Very good investment.

1319
01:33:06,737 --> 01:33:09,206
You don't want to be late
for your first day.

1320
01:33:37,435 --> 01:33:38,901
Where the fuck is 4K?

1321
01:33:40,504 --> 01:33:43,199
Excuse me!
I didn't know you was deaf!

1322
01:33:43,407 --> 01:33:44,837
4K!

1323
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,605
I'm 4K.
Is that my dinner?

1324
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:49,573
You do with it what you want.

1325
01:33:50,046 --> 01:33:51,342
It's five bucks.

1326
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:53,106
I already added in my tip.

1327
01:33:53,618 --> 01:33:54,914
How thoughtful.

1328
01:33:57,553 --> 01:33:58,645
Thank you.

1329
01:34:03,626 --> 01:34:06,789
Excuse me.
There's mustard on this sandwich.

1330
01:34:06,996 --> 01:34:07,928
So?

1331
01:34:08,129 --> 01:34:09,721
So? It's egg salad.

1332
01:34:10,164 --> 01:34:11,631
Give me the sandwich!

1333
01:34:20,742 --> 01:34:21,765
Happy now?

1334
01:34:25,245 --> 01:34:27,373
I would like a whole new sandwich.

1335
01:34:31,318 --> 01:34:32,786
Listen to me.

1336
01:34:41,662 --> 01:34:42,754
- Listen!
- Take it easy.

1337
01:34:42,962 --> 01:34:43,827
Listen to me!

1338
01:34:44,031 --> 01:34:47,090
I will never again eat a sandwich
I did not order!

1339
01:34:47,365 --> 01:34:50,665
I am sick and tired
of being afraid.

1340
01:34:50,869 --> 01:34:53,237
Bad jobs, bad sandwiches,
neurotic girlfriends.

1341
01:34:53,441 --> 01:34:55,929
No longer for this man!
Do you understand?

1342
01:34:58,543 --> 01:34:59,669
You!

1343
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:01,442
Go home!

1344
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:06,041
And you!

1345
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,344
Go clean off my door!

1346
01:35:34,277 --> 01:35:35,301
Excuse me.

1347
01:35:35,711 --> 01:35:37,406
I joined this club
a month ago...

1348
01:35:37,613 --> 01:35:40,081
...and have not received
my membership cards.

1349
01:35:40,284 --> 01:35:42,979
Could you please call the manager?
I'll find him myself.

1350
01:35:43,186 --> 01:35:44,243
Hey, sir!

1351
01:36:01,334 --> 01:36:03,895
Is everything all right, Mr. Tuttle?

1352
01:36:04,106 --> 01:36:06,233
Where's the goddamn towel boy?

1353
01:36:06,475 --> 01:36:08,376
I'm not coming out of
this pool naked!

1354
01:36:08,578 --> 01:36:10,168
Not with these parrots around!

1355
01:36:10,378 --> 01:36:12,744
Of course, Mr. Tuttle.

1356
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,240
Towel boy!

1357
01:36:19,386 --> 01:36:20,411
Sorry.

1358
01:36:21,821 --> 01:36:25,152
Hi, Mr. Manetti.
Nice threads, very Miami Beach.

1359
01:36:25,357 --> 01:36:27,121
Mr. Tuttle would like a towel.

1360
01:36:27,327 --> 01:36:29,296
All right. Yes, sir.
Here you go.

1361
01:36:29,497 --> 01:36:31,622
Hey, Mr. Tuttle.
How you doing?

1362
01:36:31,998 --> 01:36:33,989
How's everything?
There you are, sir.

1363
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:35,258
Got one.

1364
01:36:35,869 --> 01:36:37,630
Maybe you ought to take two.

1365
01:36:37,837 --> 01:36:39,861
I don't think one'll do it.

1366
01:36:40,206 --> 01:36:41,674
Less seen the better.

1367
01:36:44,243 --> 01:36:46,610
Excuse me, Mr. Tuttle.

1368
01:36:48,779 --> 01:36:50,213
Do you know Belinda Keaton?

1369
01:36:50,415 --> 01:36:51,848
No, I don't.

1370
01:36:52,652 --> 01:36:55,346
Listen, helium-head, how hard
is it to pass out towels?

1371
01:36:55,553 --> 01:36:57,045
It's a skill like anything else.

1372
01:36:57,255 --> 01:37:00,746
People pay $8,000 just to join
this club. They expect service.

1373
01:37:00,956 --> 01:37:03,483
Stop screwing around
or you're out of here.

1374
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:05,527
- Beat it!
- All right... jackoff.

1375
01:37:05,731 --> 01:37:09,188
- What was that?
- It wasn't me. It was the birds.

1376
01:37:09,398 --> 01:37:10,424
Birds.

1377
01:37:14,839 --> 01:37:15,770
Why are you here?

1378
01:37:15,974 --> 01:37:16,942
Why are you here?

1379
01:37:17,142 --> 01:37:18,130
I'm looking for Belinda.

1380
01:37:18,341 --> 01:37:19,307
Is she working here?

1381
01:37:20,178 --> 01:37:21,438
Excuse me.

1382
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,676
Don't go thinking I work here,
because I don't.

1383
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:27,815
I own it.
I bought it this morning.

1384
01:37:28,017 --> 01:37:29,747
- Straighten that strap.
- Drop dead!

1385
01:37:29,954 --> 01:37:31,351
All right, you're fired!

1386
01:37:31,555 --> 01:37:33,953
Clean out your locker.
You're history.

1387
01:37:34,156 --> 01:37:35,749
Don't go up.
You'll get in trouble.

1388
01:37:35,959 --> 01:37:37,423
With who? You own the place.

1389
01:37:37,624 --> 01:37:41,757
I know. But I got partners!
Come on, these guys are tough!

1390
01:37:42,331 --> 01:37:46,198
I'm not kidding you.
These guys are built like Checker Cabs.

1391
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:48,527
- Don't!
- Sorry.

1392
01:37:49,136 --> 01:37:51,662
- Don't go in there!
- Sorry.

1393
01:37:52,475 --> 01:37:53,943
I'm not letting you get--

1394
01:37:58,044 --> 01:37:59,536
Hey, we're in here!

1395
01:37:59,747 --> 01:38:01,372
What am I going to do?

1396
01:38:01,582 --> 01:38:03,379
You want a membership?
I'll get a commission--

1397
01:38:03,584 --> 01:38:06,053
Will you just stay out of my life?

1398
01:38:06,854 --> 01:38:09,415
You don't have to tell me
three times. I'm out!

1399
01:38:09,623 --> 01:38:10,647
Bud.

1400
01:38:28,775 --> 01:38:30,436
Can I buy you a drink?

1401
01:38:30,643 --> 01:38:32,635
I changed my mind.
I don't work--

1402
01:38:32,846 --> 01:38:34,311
I'll make it worth your while.

1403
01:38:34,513 --> 01:38:37,106
- I don't feel like it.
- The party's just starting!

1404
01:38:37,313 --> 01:38:39,580
- I really don't feel like it.
- Come on!

1405
01:38:39,785 --> 01:38:42,116
Am I glad I found you.
I got to talk to you.

1406
01:38:42,321 --> 01:38:44,812
- I saw her first!
- Actually, I saw her first.

1407
01:38:45,024 --> 01:38:46,684
Remember the argument we had?

1408
01:38:46,892 --> 01:38:48,359
- You were right.
- I was wrong!

1409
01:38:48,558 --> 01:38:50,322
- Are you done?
- No. Now, listen.

1410
01:38:50,529 --> 01:38:52,690
You were waiting for me
to say I love you...

1411
01:38:52,898 --> 01:38:54,456
...but I didn't have the guts!

1412
01:38:54,665 --> 01:38:56,860
I've got the guts now!

1413
01:38:57,068 --> 01:38:57,930
I love you too.

1414
01:38:58,135 --> 01:38:59,693
I'll show you how much.

1415
01:38:59,904 --> 01:39:01,893
Listen, slime,
you have three seconds...

1416
01:39:02,104 --> 01:39:05,168
...to take your hands off
this particular woman! One....

1417
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:09,840
Hold on, Chuck, I'm coming, buddy!

1418
01:39:12,714 --> 01:39:16,207
Where's the manager?
You guys stay right here!

1419
01:39:17,221 --> 01:39:18,381
Are you all right?

1420
01:39:18,589 --> 01:39:20,386
Did you break anything?

1421
01:39:21,424 --> 01:39:23,482
I caught an updraft.

1422
01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:26,996
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry, I'm all right.

1423
01:39:27,196 --> 01:39:29,189
Fortunately, the ground
broke my fall.

1424
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:31,490
Tell her what you were
going to tell her.

1425
01:39:40,944 --> 01:39:41,773
You love me?

1426
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:45,805
I said it.

1427
01:39:50,717 --> 01:39:52,549
I didn't say it.

1428
01:39:58,024 --> 01:39:59,355
I love you.

1429
01:40:04,934 --> 01:40:06,489
Can we do that again?

1430
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:12,333
Guys, my neck.
You got my neck a little bit.

1431
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:13,800
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

1432
01:40:14,006 --> 01:40:15,133
I'm real happy for you.

1433
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:18,607
Okay, piss-head!
You're fired!

1434
01:40:19,579 --> 01:40:21,376
That suits him just fine.

1435
01:40:21,581 --> 01:40:24,482
He's not a towel boy.
He's an idea man!

1436
01:40:24,684 --> 01:40:27,082
He couldn't find his asshole
with a funnel.

1437
01:40:27,619 --> 01:40:29,144
Never mind.

1438
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:30,918
The guy's right.

1439
01:40:31,122 --> 01:40:32,590
- He's wrong!
- He's right.

1440
01:40:32,792 --> 01:40:34,782
I've never done one thing...

1441
01:40:34,994 --> 01:40:37,483
...I ever said I was going to do.

1442
01:40:37,928 --> 01:40:40,692
That is not true.
Remember when we first met?

1443
01:40:40,898 --> 01:40:42,924
You said,
"I'll make a man out of you."

1444
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:45,296
Could I have done
all this without you?

1445
01:40:45,772 --> 01:40:46,598
Done all what?

1446
01:40:58,382 --> 01:41:00,679
You can't talk to
my very good friend...

1447
01:41:00,884 --> 01:41:02,943
...and the woman
that I love like that.

1448
01:41:03,387 --> 01:41:04,547
Now, look.

1449
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:08,757
I know that you're a very powerful man.

1450
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:13,122
I know that you could break my back
like a little toothpick.

1451
01:41:13,328 --> 01:41:16,422
There's only one question
I've got to ask.

1452
01:41:17,434 --> 01:41:19,593
Is that a gun under your jacket?

1453
01:41:21,705 --> 01:41:22,692
Fine.

1454
01:41:32,181 --> 01:41:34,205
Vice Squad!
It's a raid!

1455
01:41:34,914 --> 01:41:36,678
Vice Squad! Vice Squad!

1456
01:41:49,063 --> 01:41:50,495
Put some clothes on, idiot!

1457
01:41:50,697 --> 01:41:52,063
Don't touch the car, punk!

1458
01:41:52,266 --> 01:41:53,961
Wait, they're not coming!

1459
01:41:54,335 --> 01:41:56,165
We made it!

1460
01:41:58,504 --> 01:41:59,698
You were great!

1461
01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:01,601
You were kissing!

1462
01:42:01,874 --> 01:42:02,771
I'm cold!

1463
01:42:02,975 --> 01:42:04,805
You were fabulous!

1464
01:42:05,245 --> 01:42:06,269
Here you go.
Thanks.

1465
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:10,277
Hey, Chuck, here you go:
microwave clothing. Listen to this!

1466
01:42:10,482 --> 01:42:13,007
You can stay warm
and bake a potato in your pants!

1467
01:42:13,218 --> 01:42:15,483
I think you can do better than that.

1468
01:42:16,154 --> 01:42:18,623
Baked potato.
I could kill for a baked potato.

1469
01:42:18,825 --> 01:42:20,155
Let's eat!
