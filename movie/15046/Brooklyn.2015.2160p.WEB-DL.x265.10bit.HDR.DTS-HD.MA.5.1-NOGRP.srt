1
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,317
凯丽女士 过会儿我能和您谈谈吗
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?

2
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:25,889
只要你说的话
Not if what you're going to say

3
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:28,678
不会给我带来什么麻烦
will cause trouble for me in some way or another.

4
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,070
姑娘们 早高峰已经过去了
9:00 mass is over, girls.

5
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:46,859
- 好了 - 谢谢
- Now. - Thank you.

6
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:47,727
- 请稍等一下 - 您好
- One moment, please. - Excuse me.

7
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:50,229
再给我来一些熏肉和奶酪
And some rashers and some cheese.

8
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,372
布雷迪夫人 您今天想来点什么
Mrs Brady, what would you like this morning?

9
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:58,664
- 请给我来半打熏肉 - 好的 没问题
- Half a dozen rashers, please. - Of course.

10
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,464
艾丽斯现在就给您打包
Eilis will get that for you now.

11
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:03,341
- 下一个该我了 - 你还是下一个
- I was next. - And you still are.

12
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:07,888
- 你要什么 - 我需要一些鞋油
- Yes? - I need some shoe polish.

13
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:12,173
鞋油 周日不供应鞋油 你不知道吗
Shoe polish? That's not really a Sunday item, now, is it?

14
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,754
这些人都是来买晚餐或下午茶的材料
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.

15
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,201
你怎么昨天就不记得呢
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?

16
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,675
看样子你昨天就需要鞋油了吧
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.

17
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:21,305
不好意思
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:35,751
凯丽女士
Miss Kelly...

19
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,698
我记得呢 你想说什么就说吧
I hadn't forgotten. Spit it out, whatever it is.

20
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,114
我要去美国了
I'm away to America.

21
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:46,617
这是谁的主意
Whose idea was that?

22
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,580
纽约的弗勒德神父帮我安排的
Father Flood in New York arranged it.

23
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,975
罗斯以前总是和他打高尔夫 他资助了我
Rose used to play golf with him. He sponsored me.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,836
还给我介绍了工作 并且帮我搞定了签证
And he found me a job and got me a visa.

25
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:56,497
等你回来之后 就不用来上班了
Well, we won't be needing you back here.

26
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:58,192
在走之前 我可以每个周日都来上班
I could work every Sunday till I go.

27
00:02:58,217 --> 00:02:59,601
不用了
No, thank you.

28
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,929
- 你的姐姐真可怜 - 我的姐姐
- Your poor sister. - My sister?

29
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:08,682
这个国家的母亲 总是被长大的子女抛弃
Well, mothers are always being left behind in this country.

30
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:10,559
但是罗斯
But Rose,

31
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,942
她这辈子就只能这样了 不是么
that's the end for her now, isn't it?

32
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:16,148
她的余生都要留在这里照顾你母亲了
She'll be looking after your mother for the rest of her life.

33
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:32,158
罗斯 我真该把你的事情
I wish I'd written to

34
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,506
写信告诉弗勒德神父
Father Flood about you, Rose.

35
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:35,783
我吗 我有工作
Me? I have a job.

36
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:37,803
你每个周日 都得花好几个小时
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday

37
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:39,461
为内特尔斯·凯丽打工
working for Nettles Kelly.

38
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,661
你不应该叫她的全名
You shouldn't call her that.

39
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,540
对于她这种怪脾气的老女人
I think it's quite a kind name.

40
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,428
我这么叫她 已经够客气的了
Considering she's actually a terrible old witch.

41
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:48,042
行了 我不想再谈论她了
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.

42
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,048
好吧
Good.

43
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:52,575
我听说美国的夏天更热
They say it's hotter there

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,711
冬天更冷
in the summer and colder in the winter.

45
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:59,190
天哪 她去那里应该穿什么呢
What in heaven's name will she do about clothes?

46
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:00,276
妈妈 她自己会买的
She'll buy them, Mother.

47
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,153
她才不会把钱浪费在买衣服上面
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.

48
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:04,902
她别无选择 她要在那里待...
She won't have much choice. She'll be there for...

49
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,034
- 南希 你可真美 - 谢谢夸奖
- You look beautiful, Nancy. - Thank you.

50
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,644
你这么漂亮 让我对这个地方都失望了
You look so beautiful. It makes me despair of this place.

51
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:28,029
为什么
Why?

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,634
你可是韦克斯福德郡最漂亮的女孩
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.

53
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,578
你能随心所欲地挑选男生
You should be able to choose any man you want

54
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:33,964
但愿橄榄球俱乐部的
and we're hoping that George Sheridan

55
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,116
乔治·谢立丹能看上你
from the rugby club looks your way.

56
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:37,525
你觉得他会吗
Do you think he might?

57
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,339
肯定会的
Of course he will.

58
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:43,777
{\an9\fs20}美国知名演员

59
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:41,518
南希 我知道你喜欢他
I know you like him, Nancy,

60
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,777
但他可不是加里·库珀 对吧
but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?

61
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:47,229
而且那些男生喜欢抹发油 穿西装
And those boys with their hair oil and their blazers.

62
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,252
- 他的眼睛很好看 - 嗯
- He has beautiful eyes. - Mmm...

63
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:50,332
而且他可是要继承
And he's going to come

64
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,953
一家集市广场中很不错的商店
into a beautiful shop in the market square.

65
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,136
你怎么没穿你的蓝裙子
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?

66
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:00,085
你是想说 我为什么不好好打扮一下吗
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?

67
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,963
可能是因为我要走了
I suppose cos I'm going away.

68
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,677
小心 快走
Mind, now.

69
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:07,338
快来
Come on.

70
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:38,916
他已经往这边看了两次了
He's looked over here twice already.

71
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,066
才没有
He hasn't!

72
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:44,522
- 他现在往这边走过来了 - 你骗人
- He's walking over here now. - He's not!

73
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:48,127
我为什么要拿乔治·谢立丹的事情骗你
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?

74
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:53,774
能请你跳支舞吗
Would you like to dance?

75
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,690
这就是你全部的家当吗
Is that really everything you own?

76
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:46,525
哦 艾丽斯
Oh, Eilis.

77
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:49,284
我应该好好照顾你的
I should have looked after you better.

78
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,333
这箱衣服基本上都是你给我买的
You've bought most of the clothes in this case.

79
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,215
我都不能自己买衣服
That's one of the reasons I'm going,

80
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,312
这也是我想离开家的原因之一
cos I can't buy my own.

81
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,133
如果真是那样
If it was just that,

82
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:59,393
我宁愿把挣到的每一分钱都花在你身上
I'd spend every penny I had on you.

83
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:01,066
我很愿意
Gladly.

84
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,308
但是我没法给你一个未来
But I can't buy you a future.

85
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,087
我没法给予你想要的生活
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.

86
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:08,404
我明白
I know.

87
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:13,135
总有一天你会去看我的吧
But you'll come see me there one day?

88
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:14,345
当然了
Yes.

89
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,700
你会好好照顾自己吧
And you'll look after yourself?

90
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,476
你不用担心我
You don't have to worry about me.

91
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,751
我能回家看看的 对吧
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?

92
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,745
因为我会受不了...
Cos I couldn't bear it if...

93
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,817
你还没把鞋子收拾好呢
You haven't packed your shoes yet.

94
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:31,179
它们可要占不少位置
They'll take up a bit of room.

95
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,152
好了
There.

96
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:28,672
抱歉
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,729
下来
Off.

98
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:44,586
一号 下铺 是我的位置
Number one, bottom bunk, that's mine.

99
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,725
你是上铺
You're on the top.

100
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:54,505
这鬼地方真是地狱
This is hell.

101
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:57,552
- 再也不要坐船了 - 再也不去美国了
- Never again. - Never again to America?

102
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:00,574
当初我就不该从美国回来
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.

103
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,348
只要能不让我待在这鬼船舱 做什么都可以
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.

104
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,367
一起出去抽根烟吧
Let's go for a smoke.

105
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,684
我不会抽烟
I don't.

106
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:10,687
随你便 一会儿见
Suit yourself. I'll see you later.

107
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:14,039
但愿我能找到一个头等舱的男士作伴
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.

108
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:33,947
幸好还有人不受天气预报影响
It's good to see that not everybody's

109
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,037
愿意来吃晚餐
put off their dinner by the weather forecast.

110
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,708
据说今晚天气很糟糕
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight,

111
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,499
所以现在没别的乘客来用餐了
so none of the other passengers are eating.

112
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,179
大概也就喝一点汤 但不会吃炖羊肉
A few spoonfuls of soup maybe, but not the mutton stew.

113
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:57,733
请开门
Please unlock it.

114
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:28,953
走开
Go away!

115
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,554
对不起 搞得到处都是臭味
I'm sorry about the smell.

116
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:46,366
还把水桶搞脏
And the bucket.

117
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:49,072
别担心 整艘船都一片狼藉
Don't worry. The whole boat stinks.

118
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:50,520
包括头等舱
Even First Class.

119
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,857
忘了说 我刚从头等舱被赶出来了
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.

120
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,883
洗手间整晚都锁着
The bathroom door was locked all night.

121
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,761
那些贱人
Oh, those bastards.

122
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,841
好了 虽然过意不去 但毕竟厕所归我们了
There. Won't be very comfortable, but at least it's ours.

123
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:33,204
- 开门 - 滚开
- Open the door. - Fuck off.

124
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:35,110
- 快开门 - 我说了 滚开
- Open the door right now. - Do you hear me? Fuck off.

125
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:37,871
如果你昨晚能友善一些 我们也会以礼相待的
If you'd been nice last night, we would have played fair.

126
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,702
- 现在你们没得用了 - 滚出洗手间
- Now you've got no toilet. - Get out of the bathroom.

127
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:40,977
贱人
You bastards.

128
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:43,433
去吧 你可以用了
Go on, you can use it.

129
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,142
我去拿点水来 你现在只能喝水了
I'm going to get us some water. That's all you're allowed.

130
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,556
你要在美国定居吗
Are you going to live in America?

131
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:56,186
是的
Yes.

132
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,021
证件和其他东西都准备好了吗
You have papers and everything?

133
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,583
是的 工作也有了
Yes. And a job.

134
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,686
你是怎么搞定的
How'd you manage to arrange all that?

135
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,893
不是我弄的 有人替我办好了
I didn't. Someone did it for me.

136
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,540
是我姐姐认识的神父
A priest my sister knows.

137
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,536
那你对此感觉怎么样呢
And how do you feel about it?

138
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,091
从爱尔兰寄的信要多久能到美国
How long do letters from Ireland take to arrive?

139
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:18,619
我姐姐罗斯说她会尽快给我写信
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.

140
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,597
第一次要花很长时间
They take a long time at first.

141
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:22,630
之后就会很快了
And then no time at all.

142
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,540
你在美国有亲人或者朋友吗
You have family in America? Friends?

143
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:26,865
没有
No.

144
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:28,593
你会很快就交到朋友的
You'll meet people easily enough.

145
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:31,249
你要住在哪里 布鲁克林吗
Where are you gonna live? Brooklyn?

146
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:34,201
- 你怎么知道的 - 随便猜的
- How'd you know that? - Lucky guess.

147
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,128
有时候跟素不相识的人聊天
Try to remember that sometimes it's

148
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,641
是一件很愉快的事情
nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.

149
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:40,649
就像我们这样吗
That's what it's like?

150
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:42,516
没错
That's what it's like.

151
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:50,574
我已经好几个小时不犯恶心了
I haven't been sick for hours.

152
00:13:50,808 --> 00:13:52,242
太好了
Nice, isn't it?

153
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:54,494
我现在好饿
I'm very hungry.

154
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:56,724
所以你才好几个小时不恶心
That's why you haven't been sick for hours.

155
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,999
明天再吃东西吧
We'll eat tomorrow.

156
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,330
或者后天
Or the day after.

157
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,260
亲爱的 我得把你改造一下
Oh, dear. We're gonna have to do something with you.

158
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,257
不然你这样入境的话
They'll put you in quarantine or something

159
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:14,459
他们会把你隔离的
if you try and enter the country looking like that.

160
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:18,185
不能太花哨 不能看起来太招摇
Nothing fancy. You mustn't look like a tart.

161
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,353
其实太招摇也没问题
Oh, well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.

162
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,923
这件看起来还不错
This doesn't look too bad.

163
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,741
我姐姐给我买的
My sister gave me that.

164
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,582
搭配上这件
Wear it with this

165
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,024
和这件
and...

166
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,121
还有这件
...this.

167
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:44,606
将行李准备好 接受检查
Have your bags ready for inspection.

168
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:46,588
别表现得一脸天真
Don't look too innocent, though.

169
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,133
给你擦点口红 涂点睫毛膏
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.

170
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,553
再画个眼线也行
Perhaps a little eye liner.

171
00:15:05,622 --> 00:15:09,040
请站在线后面 下一位 谢谢
Step out of the line, please. Thank you. Next, please. Thank you.

172
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:11,988
请往这边走 站在线后面
Step over this way, please. Get out of the line.

173
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:13,740
下一位 请出示护照
Next. Passport, please.

174
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,438
挺胸抬头
Stand up straight.

175
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,371
擦亮鞋子
Polish your shoes.

176
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,830
无论如何都不要咳嗽
And don't cough, whatever you do.

177
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:21,723
往这边走
Over this way.

178
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:26,755
别表现得粗鲁或者固执 但也别紧张
Don't be rude or pushy, but don't look too nervous.

179
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:28,928
往这边走
Step this way.

180
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,344
把自己当做一个美国人
Think like an American.

181
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,683
你心中总要有明确的方向
You have to know where you're going.

182
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:36,555
欢迎入境 夫人
Welcome to the United States, ma'am.

183
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:38,640
请往蓝色大门走
Through the blue door, please.

184
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,240
下一位
Next, please.

185
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:24,460
主啊
Bless us, oh Lord,

186
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,322
感谢您赐给我们食物
and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty

187
00:16:27,347 --> 00:16:28,875
让我们有幸享用它 阿门
through Christ our Lord, amen.

188
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,226
阿门
Amen.

189
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:37,079
戴安娜 我看你今天收到信了 有什么新鲜事吗
I saw you had a letter today, Diana. Any news?

190
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,357
她说 德瓦莱拉先生还有另一场眼部手术
Mr de Valera's had another operation on his eyes,

191
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:40,636
他去荷兰了
she says. He's been in Holland.

192
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,412
我已经在报纸上看过了
I don't want news I can read in a newspaper.

193
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:45,176
而且 我们都认为德瓦莱拉先生是个政客
Anyway, we would describe Mr de Valera as politics,

194
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:46,519
不是吗 基欧夫人
would we not, Mrs Kehoe?

195
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:48,368
我们可不喜欢在餐桌上讨论政治问题
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.

196
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,335
当然
We don't.

197
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,226
眼部手术跟政治又没关系
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.

198
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,499
这可是政治家的眼部手术
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.

199
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,476
我也不喜欢在饭桌上谈论医学问题
And I don't like to talk about hospitals very much either.

200
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,791
帕蒂 你买到那个雪花膏了吗
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?

201
00:16:58,816 --> 00:16:59,557
没有 基欧夫人
No, Mrs Kehoe.

202
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:00,928
我问过化妆品店的泰勒小姐了
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.

203
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,427
我还把宣传画给她看了
And I showed her the advertisement.

204
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:04,252
我可不愿意为了区区一罐雪花膏
I don't want to have to travel all the way into Manhattan

205
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:05,725
特地跑到曼哈顿去
just for a jar of cold cream.

206
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,818
艾丽斯 你能帮我去巴托奇店里看一下吗
Maybe you could have a look in Bartocci's for me, Eilis?

207
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:09,400
好的 基欧夫人
Yes, Mrs Kehoe.

208
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:10,809
巴托奇店里一定会有的
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.

209
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,767
她也不能百分百确定 基欧夫人
She doesn't know that for sure, Mrs Kehoe.

210
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:13,598
她只不过是在
She's only saying that

211
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:15,372
暗示帕蒂 巴托奇商场要比
Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's

212
00:17:15,397 --> 00:17:16,238
韦伯斯特商场高档
to get at Patty.

213
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:17,865
两个商场都很好
They're both very good

214
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,659
而且你们能在那里工作真是很幸运
and you girls are very lucky to be working there.

215
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:24,218
艾丽斯 我看你的皮肤很润滑
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin.

216
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:26,708
对吧 你是怎么保养的
Is that right? What do you do about that?

217
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:33,095
基欧夫人 我就是用香皂洗脸
Just... Well, I wash it, Mrs Kehoe, with soap.

218
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:34,601
用香皂没什么问题
There's nothing wrong with soap.

219
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,960
我想 对于主来说香皂已经够好了
Soap was good enough for Our Lord, I expect.

220
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:39,302
麦克亚当小姐 他用什么牌子的香皂呢
Oh, and which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?

221
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,191
圣经上有写吗
Does the Bible tell you that?

222
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:43,121
再说了 主毕竟是个男人
Our Lord was a man, anyway.

223
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:44,547
他才不会在意他的肤质
He didn't care about greasy skin.

224
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,101
女士们 请别在吃饭的时候
Ladies, no more talk about

225
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:48,687
讨论基督的肤质问题了
our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.

226
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,677
艾丽斯 她们会帮你找到 适合你的东西
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis.

227
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,695
- 对吧 女孩们 - 没错
- Won't you, girls? - Mmm-hmm.

228
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,223
嗨
Hi.

229
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,560
- 早上好 - 你昨晚出去了吗
- Good morning. - Did you go out last night?

230
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,518
- 我是说出门 - 没有
- Out, the opposite of in. - No.

231
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,598
我昨晚跟男朋友看了场电影
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.

232
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:40,036
"你看的什么电影 桃乐茜"
"What did you see, Dorothy?"

233
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:42,073
"艾丽斯 我看的《蓬门今始为君开》
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis.

234
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:43,038
在爱尔兰拍的"
They filmed it in Ireland."

235
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:44,722
"真巧 我就来自爱尔兰"
"Oh, I'm from Ireland."

236
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:48,257
"我知道 所以我才觉得你可能会感兴趣"
"I know you are. That's why I thought you might be interested."

237
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:51,178
谢谢
Thank you.

238
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:10,450
马上就好
Shouldn't be a moment.

239
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:25,617
外面还是很热吗
Is it still hot out there?

240
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,511
我今天早上就没出去过
I haven't been outside since this morning.

241
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:30,455
不过我猜应该很热
But I can tell that it might be very.

242
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,816
看上去就热
It just looks it.

243
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,253
没错 的确很暖和
It's warm, yes.

244
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,617
非常感谢
Thanks very much.

245
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:53,711
记住 如果顾客喜欢这里 她们还会再来
Remember, if people like it here, they'll come back,

246
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:56,481
所以你要把每位顾客 当作新朋友一样对待
so you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.

247
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:58,623
- 我会努力 - 这不是你努力与否的问题
- I'll try. - It's not a matter of trying.

248
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,068
而是你必须这么做
It's what you have to do.

249
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:02,285
你需要每天努力穿短裤吗
Do you try to wear panties every day?

250
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,447
不用
No.

251
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,340
我的意思是 我不用努力去做 我直接穿上
I mean, I don't... I don't try. I just put them on.

252
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,347
现在你懂我的意思了吧
You see what I'm saying?

253
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,150
我懂了
Yes.

254
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:12,330
那就好
Good.

255
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:19,838
请再来份土司 好吗
Can we get another side of toast, please?

256
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:21,172
把热狗切一下
Slice up some hot dogs.

257
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:23,341
他们要从中间切开
They want 'em sliced down the middle.

258
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,301
你好 这里结账
Sorry. Could I have the bill, please?

259
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,121
当我穿过天国之门
I hope that when I go through the Pearly Gates,

260
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,484
真希望听到的第一个声音就是
the first sound I hear is you asking me for the cheque

261
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:43,938
你用悦耳的爱尔兰口音向我要账单
in that lovely Irish brogue.

262
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:01,671
戴安娜
Diana?

263
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:39,360
艾丽斯 她们跟你说过
Have they told you a date for

264
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,877
尼龙袜什么时候开始卖吗
the nylon sale yet, Eilis?

265
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:43,438
以前从来没有巴托奇商场的姑娘住在这里
Never had a Bartocci's girl living here.

266
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:45,645
也许能听到一些内部消息
Might get some inside information.

267
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,277
我还不知道呢
I haven't been told anything.

268
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,085
我猜就算你听到了也不会说的
I bet you wouldn't let on if you had.

269
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,092
她就是这样
She's that sort.

270
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:51,809
对待她的上司比她的朋友还好
More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.

271
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:54,099
- 就像一个红色间谍 - 得了吧
- Like a Red spy. - Oh, dear God.

272
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:55,948
你要是不在我们
I'll thank you to keep

273
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,731
讨论尼龙袜的时候提到他 我会感激不尽的
His name out of a conversation about nylons.

274
00:21:59,137 --> 00:21:59,936
他或许无处不在
He might be everywhere,

275
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:02,065
但他肯定不会在巴托奇的打折日出现
but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.

276
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:03,608
抱歉 基欧夫人
Sorry, Mrs Kehoe.

277
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:04,895
艾丽斯 我很高兴你今天终于
I was glad to see you finally

278
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,543
收到了家里的来信
got some letters from home today, Eilis.

279
00:22:07,063 --> 00:22:08,813
是吗 我忘了看
Did I? I forgot to check.

280
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:11,282
它们不会长腿跑掉的 先吃晚饭
They'll still be there after dinner.

281
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:13,261
抱歉
Sorry.

282
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,924
"亲爱的艾丽斯
"Dear Eilis.

283
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,577
我实在是难以想象
It's hard for me to believe that

284
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:31,302
你会在远隔千里之外的美国
you're reading this in America,

285
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:33,680
读到这封信
thousands of miles across the sea.

286
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:37,350
最近的大事就是 自从你走了之后
The big news here is that since you left,

287
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:40,019
妈妈再也不去内特尔斯·凯丽的店里买东西了
Mammy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.

288
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:43,096
就像你知道的 她那的面包不怎么新鲜
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh

289
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:45,149
而且还漫天要价
and she overcharged for everything...

290
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:47,321
她真是讨厌"
And she's awful."

291
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,987
我没跟她当面对质过
I haven't told her to her face.

292
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,321
没这个必要了
There's no need.

293
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:53,497
她知道她抬价宰客 而且面包不新鲜
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.

294
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:57,954
"我们每晚都谈到你
We talk about you every evening, of course.

295
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,808
我们想知道你生活中的一切
We want to know everything.

296
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,709
我知道你一定很忙
I'm sure you're busy,

297
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:06,234
但哪怕你的信有两百页
but even if your letters were 200 pages,

298
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,506
你妈妈也不会嫌多的
they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.

299
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:17,326
照顾好自己 爱你"
Take care of yourself. Love.

300
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:33,237
你是生理期到了吗
Is it your time of the month?

301
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:35,700
那是怎么回事
So what is it?

302
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:43,039
去休息一会 到员工休息室里坐坐
Take some time off now. Go and sit in the staff room.

303
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,927
真抱歉 艾丽斯 都怪我
I'm so sorry, Eilis. This is all my fault.

304
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:58,588
我还以为你不需要人照顾
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.

305
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,924
弗朗哥·巴托奇说你工作非常出色
Franco Bartocci says you're doing great here.

306
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:03,861
基欧妈妈说你是她见过的最好的房客
Ma Kehoe says you're the nicest lodger she's ever had.

307
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,221
- 怎么了 - "基欧妈妈"
- What? - "Ma Kehoe"?

308
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:08,365
别当着她的面这么叫
Don't ever call her that to her face.

309
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:12,820
我忘了背井离乡的感觉有多痛苦
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.

310
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,054
我给你报了夜校
I've enrolled you in a night class,

311
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:18,434
在布鲁克林学院 学记账
for book-keeping. Brooklyn College.

312
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:19,959
每周三个晚上
It'll be three nights a week

313
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,913
我替你交了第一学期的学费
and I've paid your tuition for the first semester.

314
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,376
- 为什么 - 为什么 不说谢谢吗
- Why? - Why? Not thank you?

315
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:30,171
抱歉 谢谢您 但是为什么呢
Sorry. Thank you. But why?

316
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,258
我很惊讶 像你这样聪明的孩子
Well, I was amazed that someone as clever as you

317
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:34,425
在家乡竟然找不到合适的工作
couldn't find proper work at home.

318
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,136
我已经在这待得太久了
I've been here too long.

319
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:39,263
忘记了爱尔兰的模样
I forget what it's like in Ireland.

320
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,392
所以当你姐姐来信时
So when your sister wrote to me about you,

321
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:44,597
我说教会愿意帮忙
I said the Church would try to help.

322
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,573
总之 布鲁克林需要爱尔兰姑娘
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.

323
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,577
我希望可以别再想什么
I wish that I could stop feeling

324
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:52,777
打退堂鼓的事情了
that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.

325
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,789
我只能说 都会过去的
All I can say is that it will pass.

326
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,949
思乡病和大部分病差不多
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.

327
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:01,087
让你难受不已
It'll make you feel wretched

328
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:03,663
然后再传染给其他人
and then it'll move on to somebody else.

329
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,860
目前 泰勒诉通用燃气公司
Now, Taylor v. Standard Gas

330
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:10,548
是过去二十年中最高法院裁定的
Company is one of the most important corporate cases

331
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:13,214
最重要的企业案之一
decided in the Supreme Court in the last 20 years.

332
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:16,759
深石原则就是由此案得来的
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock Doctrine,

333
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:16,759
{\an9\fs20}也叫衡平居次原则 即从属公司在进行清算 和解 重整等程序时 控股公司对从属公司的债权应次于从属公司的其他债权进行清偿

334
00:25:17,034 --> 00:25:21,029
所以它或许是子母公司法中 里程碑式的案件
so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.

335
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:25,309
仅在公共事业一体诉讼中
In public utility integration proceedings alone,

336
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:27,276
就有成千上万的投资者
literally thousands of

337
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:30,106
受到这条原则的影响
investors may be affected by its application.

338
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:36,988
你听懂了吗
Did you understand any of that?

339
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:39,117
哪怕听懂一点点
I mean, a single word?

340
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,744
他根本不是照本宣科
He's not even reading from a book.

341
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:44,348
而是全都烂熟于心
He just knows all this.

342
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:48,364
只能指望后面一小时能容易些了
Well, let's hope the next hour's easier, huh?

343
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:04,307
在美国过圣诞节 一大不好的东西就是火鸡
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.

344
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:06,142
吃起来像木屑一样
It all tastes of sawdust.

345
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:08,404
那就只让麦克亚当小姐吃芝士三明治
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam

346
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:10,167
其他人加份火鸡好了
and extra turkey for everyone else.

347
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,683
淑女些 别笑了
Ladies, please.

348
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:15,968
艾丽斯 弗勒德神父让我问问你
Eilis, Father Flood told me

349
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:17,236
圣诞节有什么计划
about your Christmas plans.

350
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:18,757
你不会是要去给那些
Oh, you're not serving lunch

351
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,531
无家可归的老家伙们送午餐吧
to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?

352
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:22,658
他每年都问我们去不去 我们都推了
He asks us every year. We always say no.

353
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:25,112
艾丽斯 你可真是个好人 他们的味道很恶心
Eilis, you're a saint. They smell awful.

354
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,326
希拉知道他们闻起来什么味道
Sheila knows how they smell

355
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,872
因为她就在那堆人里面物色丈夫的
because that's where she goes husband hunting.

356
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:32,937
艾丽斯 你做的这件事很棒
It's a marvellous thing you're doing, Eilis.

357
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:34,420
这才是信徒该做的
A Christian thing.

358
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:36,301
希望有更多人能像你一样
I wish there were more like you.

359
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,484
请进
In you come.

360
00:26:42,544 --> 00:26:43,596
大概会来多少人
How many are we expecting?

361
00:26:43,722 --> 00:26:46,124
去年来了一百人 今年可能更多
We had a hundred last year. There may be more this.

362
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:49,060
- 他们都是爱尔兰人吗 - 都是
- Are they all Irish? - All Irish.

363
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,726
他们为什么不回家乡呢
Why don't they go home?

364
00:26:52,881 --> 00:26:54,031
如果像你这样
If there's nothing there for

365
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:55,233
聪明又年轻的姑娘在那都无处傍身
clever young girls such as yourself,

366
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,693
对于像他们这样的就更不容易了
there's gonna be even less for men like these.

367
00:26:57,902 --> 00:27:00,485
他们中有些人已经来了五十年了
Some of them have been here 50 years.

368
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:02,198
与家乡完全断了音讯
They've lost touch with everyone.

369
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:03,508
很好 谢谢你
Lovely. Thank you.

370
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:05,785
- 圣诞快乐 - 谢谢
- Merry Christmas. - Thank you.

371
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:09,246
是他们曾修桥开渠
These are the men who built the tunnels,

372
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,219
铺路营建
the bridges, the highways.

373
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,133
可现在天知道他们靠什么活着
God alone knows what they live on now.

374
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:30,658
总之...
Anyway...

375
00:27:35,498 --> 00:27:37,650
我不想打断大家
I don't want to interrupt proceedings,

376
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:41,314
但我相信大家都想向今天
but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation

377
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:43,656
为我们辛勤服务的女士们表示感谢
to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.

378
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:45,169
另外感谢
And by way of a thank you,

379
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:47,535
今天来了一位伟大的演唱家
we have a great singer in the room with us today.

380
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,479
弗兰基
Frankie.

381
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,085
小心
Mind yourself, there.

382
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:45,158
{\an9\fs20}《Casadh An Tsúgáin》

383
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,912
你想来客厅
Would you like to come

384
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,845
喝一杯吗
into the front room for a glass of something?

385
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,447
你应得的
You've earned it.

386
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:02,980
你撑下来了
You survived.

387
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,712
没那么糟糕
It wasn't so bad.

388
00:30:09,094 --> 00:30:11,137
- 圣诞快乐 - 干杯
- Happy Christmas. - Cheers.

389
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,686
麦克亚当小姐要搬走了
Now, Miss McAdam is leaving us.

390
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:20,955
她要去和在曼哈顿的姐姐一起住
She's going to live with her sister in Manhattan.

391
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:23,626
她的房间是这栋房子里最好的
She has the best room in the house,

392
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,653
地下室那间
the basement,

393
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:27,820
有个单独的大门
and it has its own entrance.

394
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:29,822
我只想让
Now, I can only let

395
00:30:29,948 --> 00:30:33,451
某类特定的女孩住在那
a certain kind of girl stay there.

396
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:33,451
{\an9\fs20}此类型的建筑地下半层内部与房子相通但单独开门 故房东不易监管

397
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:35,411
当然 我说的不是长相
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.

398
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:38,080
虽然我得承认 在我考虑谁是最佳人选时
Although I will admit, God did give Miss McAdam an advantage

399
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:40,458
上帝给了麦克亚当小姐一张安全的脸
when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.

400
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:42,460
其实你很漂亮 艾丽斯
No, no, you're a pretty girl, Eilis,

401
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,628
关键在于你很懂事
but you're sensible.

402
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,548
所以 那间房间归你了
So, you're having the room and that's that.

403
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:49,543
其他人会介意吗
Will the other girls not mind?

404
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,093
我猜会的
Oh, I expect so.

405
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:53,088
有什么事是她们不介意的吗
What don't they mind?

406
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,560
姑娘们 你们会带德洛莉丝去
Girls, you'll take Dolores to

407
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:01,728
周六晚上的舞会 对吧
the dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?

408
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:02,732
有舞会吗
There's a dance?

409
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:04,002
在教区大厅
At the parish hall.

410
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:06,919
不提供酒水 但是没酒你也一样能玩得开心
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.

411
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:10,696
帕蒂和我这周就不去了
Um... Patty and I aren't going this week.

412
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,743
我们改为看电影了
We're going to see a movie instead.

413
00:31:14,066 --> 00:31:16,160
我相信德洛莉丝也很乐意去看电影的
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.

414
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:17,745
我非常乐意
I would, very much.

415
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,831
纽约的电影可比卡文多多了
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.

416
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,831
{\an9\fs20}爱尔兰一城镇 为卡文郡郡治

417
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,622
多新鲜哪
Yes, surprising, isn't it?

418
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,278
你难道以为卡文的电影会更多吗
You'd think it'd be the other way round.

419
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:30,373
没问题 我们当然欢迎你来 德洛莉丝
Of course, you would be welcome to join us, Dolores.

420
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,676
只要你不介意当电灯泡的话
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.

421
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:34,528
所以你俩在过去的几天里
So you both miraculously found

422
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:37,108
都奇迹般地找到了男朋友吗
boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?

423
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:39,156
我希望你们这次
Well, I hope you have more

424
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:41,227
能比前几次运气好点
luck with these than you did with the last few.

425
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,234
- 艾丽斯 你去吗 - 我去 基欧夫人
- Will you be going, Eilis? - Yes, Mrs Kehoe.

426
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:47,272
- 那你可以带德洛莉丝去 - 好的
- Well, you can take Dolores, then. - Of course.

427
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:11,590
天哪 这都没什么人
God. There's nobody here.

428
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:16,137
连人都没有 我们怎么找小伙子
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?

429
00:32:16,221 --> 00:32:18,597
我想大多数人九点之后才会来
I expect most people will come after 9:00.

430
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,850
人 还是小伙子
People or fellas?

431
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,061
有人就会有小伙子
Some of the people will be fellas.

432
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:26,991
我是来找男人的
I'd love to meet a fella.

433
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:32,361
他们来了 这两个骗子
They came. The liars.

434
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,742
真是一对贱人
What a pair of bitches.

435
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,616
那些老妇人就是这么叫她们的
That's what the old woman called them.

436
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,910
她说她们都是贱人
She said they were all bitches.

437
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:43,094
你除外
Apart from you.

438
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:55,176
嗨
Well, hello.

439
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:57,501
嗨 很高兴看到你们
Hello. It's good to see you.

440
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:58,902
看得出来
I can see why.

441
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,429
跟我们来
Come with us.

442
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,013
好了 这样好多了
There. That's better.

443
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,660
这样你就不像刚给牛挤完奶了
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.

444
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:24,288
- 我看起来像那样吗 - 有点
- Is that what I looked like? - Just a bit.

445
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:26,912
可爱的 干净的奶牛
Nice, clean cows.

446
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:29,668
一 二 三
One, two, three.

447
00:33:29,794 --> 00:33:31,670
二 二 三
Two, two, three.

448
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:35,174
跳得不错
Not bad.

449
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,957
二...
Two...

450
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:47,311
我们不如待会儿再跳吧
Maybe we can have a dance later.

451
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:48,744
你说什么
I'm sorry?

452
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:51,315
- 回头再跳 - 好的
- A dance, later. - Oh. Sure.

453
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:54,181
能请你跳支舞吗
Would you like to dance?

454
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:07,803
你是和那个
Are you here with that guy,

455
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:09,875
教你跳舞的人一起来的吗
the one who was teaching you to dance?

456
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:12,836
- 不是 - 那能请你跳支舞吗
- No. - So would you dance with me?

457
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:14,922
我不确定我学会了
I'm not sure he taught me anything.

458
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,257
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

459
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,509
诀窍就是你看起来会就行
Secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.

460
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,725
要是几年前有人这么告诉我就好了
I wish someone had told me that years ago.

461
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,282
来吧
Come on.

462
00:34:57,507 --> 00:34:59,216
你住哪里
Where do you live?

463
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:02,928
- 克林顿街 - 是吗
- Clinton Street. - Yeah?

464
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,910
在我回家的路上
That's on my way home.

465
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:09,018
我能送你回家吗
Can I walk you?

466
00:35:09,894 --> 00:35:12,813
可以 但我得告诉你 我同意的原因
I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.

467
00:35:12,897 --> 00:35:14,732
以免我会错意
So I don't get the wrong idea?

468
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:16,465
算是吧
I suppose so.

469
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:21,196
看到那个穿白衬衫 独个坐在那里的姑娘了吗
Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?

470
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:28,245
- 你不会认识她吧 - 没错
- You don't know her? - I do.

471
00:35:29,456 --> 00:35:32,249
她和我寄宿在同一件公寓 她很烦人
She lives in my boarding house and she's awful.

472
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,835
如果我和你一起走了 我相信她能理解的
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.

473
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,737
- 所以你这是救了我 - 我懂了
- You'd be rescuing me. - I get it.

474
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,611
我不是爱尔兰人
I'm not Irish.

475
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:03,553
你没有爱尔兰口音
You don't sound Irish.

476
00:36:04,785 --> 00:36:06,575
我得说明白
I need to make this clear.

477
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:09,075
我一点爱尔兰血统都没有
No part of me is Irish.

478
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:12,915
我父母不是 我祖父母不是 都不是
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.

479
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:16,001
我是意大利人 反正我父母是
I'm Italian. Well, my parents are, anyway.

480
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,128
那你为什么要来爱尔兰人的舞会呢
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?

481
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:20,214
意大利人没有舞会吗
Don't the Italians have dances?

482
00:36:20,436 --> 00:36:22,633
有 但我不会想带你去参加的
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna take you to one.

483
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:24,843
整晚大家都特别意大利人
They behave like Italians all night.

484
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:27,304
- 那是什么意思 - 你懂的
- What does that mean? - Oh, you know.

485
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,074
我不太懂
No.

486
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:30,933
鼓掌
Hands.

487
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,267
总是鼓掌吗
Too many of them?

488
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:33,612
我猜作为姑娘
I guess it could seem that way

489
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:36,531
你应该会有这种感觉 听着...
if you was a girl. Listen...

490
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,693
我想把话讲清楚
I want everything out in the open.

491
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,930
我去爱尔兰舞会...
I came to the Irish dance...

492
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,784
因为我特别喜欢爱尔兰姑娘
because I really like Irish girls.

493
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:51,578
而我是唯一一个肯同你跳舞的吗
And I was the only one who would dance with you?

494
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:53,038
不是 才不是...
Oh, no, it wasn't...

495
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:55,791
所以你和很多人跳过吗
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?

496
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:06,635
我到了
This is me.

497
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,223
我下周能来接你吗
Can I take you next week,

498
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:13,517
我们可以先去吃个晚饭
maybe get something to eat first?

499
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:17,187
好的
That'd be nice.

500
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,149
晚安
Good night.

501
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:40,330
那么...
So...

502
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:45,215
你不上班时都做些什么
What do you do when you're not working?

503
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:48,760
我上夜校
Well, there's school.

504
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,763
你知道的 布鲁克林学院
Just, you know, Brooklyn College.

505
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:53,557
我在学记账
I'm studying book-keeping.

506
00:37:53,683 --> 00:37:55,392
你想当簿记员
You wanna be a book-keeper?

507
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:58,193
以后我想做会计
Well, I want to be an accountant one day,

508
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,938
不过没错 得先从簿记员开始
but, yes, book-keeping first.

509
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,288
那些东西难吗
Is that difficult?

510
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,760
我说得太多了 跟我说说修水管吧
I'm talking too much. Tell me about plumbing.

511
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,573
你对修水管了解得够多了
You know enough about plumbing already.

512
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:11,253
我什么都不了解啊
I don't know anything.

513
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:16,097
你懂得水龙头漏水 马桶堵了
You know that taps drip and that toilets get blocked

514
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:17,944
知道这些就够了
and that's all you need to know.

515
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:20,385
我对记账可一无所知
I mean, I don't know anything about book-keeping.

516
00:38:24,422 --> 00:38:26,215
它包含很多东西
Well, there's a lot to it.

517
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,426
全是数学 不过并不复杂
There's all the maths, of course, but that's not so complicated.

518
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:32,054
只有复式记账法需要花些时间来适应
The double-entry system, that takes a while to get used to.

519
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:32,054
{\an9\fs20}现代商业及其他金融交易的标准系统 即每一笔交易至少记录在两个不同的账户中 即借方和贷方 而且借贷总额相等

520
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:35,685
而且我们还要学公司法 这部分很难
And we study company law too and that terrifies me.

521
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,434
我们要阅读一篇三十年代
So we had to read about an insurance company

522
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,436
破产保险公司的材料
that went bankrupt in the 1930s

523
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:41,638
掌握其中所有相关的法律问题
and all the legal issues that went along with that.

524
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:44,149
她打高尔夫 而且打得特别好
She plays golf and she's really good at it

525
00:38:44,275 --> 00:38:45,859
而且如果她也去了上周六的舞会
and if she'd been at the dance last Saturday,

526
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:48,153
我觉着你都不会看我第二眼
then I don't think you'd have looked at me twice

527
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:50,405
因为罗斯非常漂亮
because Rose is beautiful.

528
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:54,969
我有点担心 你没怎么吃东西
I'm worried. You haven't eaten anything.

529
00:38:56,674 --> 00:38:58,497
光忙着讲话了
Too busy talking.

530
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:08,977
你们怎么回事
What is the matter with you girls now?

531
00:39:09,002 --> 00:39:11,134
我们才没什么事 基欧夫人
Nothing is the matter with us, Mrs. Kehoe.

532
00:39:11,424 --> 00:39:13,783
是因为艾丽斯找了个男朋友吗
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?

533
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,385
艾丽斯找了男朋友
Eilis has a young man?

534
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:16,746
我们竟不知道
We didn't know.

535
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,267
她什么都不肯说
She won't say anything about it.

536
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,374
她为什么要跟你们这群长舌妇说
And why should she to you awful gossipmongers?

537
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:26,024
周六晚上 他来接艾丽斯的时候我见过他
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night when he called for Eilis,

538
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,276
是个不错的小伙子
and he's a gentleman.

539
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,695
您能讲讲他的事吗 基欧夫人
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs. Kehoe?

540
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:31,154
我们只知道他长得挺好看
We know he's quite nice-looking.

541
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:33,226
我不是很喜欢他的鞋
Didn't like his shoes much.

542
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:35,784
他的鞋子有什么问题
What on Earth is wrong with his shoes?

543
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:37,869
颜色很搞笑
They were a funny colour.

544
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:39,800
我就说这么多
I'll tell you this much.

545
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:41,459
我要请弗勒德神父
I'm going to ask Father Flood

546
00:39:41,484 --> 00:39:43,959
好好说说轻浮的危害
to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.

547
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:47,129
我觉得轻浮该算作第八宗罪
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.

548
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:47,129
{\an9\fs20}基督教对人类罪行的分类 即贪食 色欲 贪婪 悲叹 暴怒 懒惰 自负 以及傲慢

549
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:52,358
轻浮的女孩和懒惰的男人一样有罪
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man,

550
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:54,602
而且她发出的噪音更糟糕
and the noise she makes is a lot worse.

551
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:55,870
够了
Now, enough.

552
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:21,913
我只想送你回家
All I wanna do is travel home with you.

553
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,207
不必吃饭 不必喝东西 什么都不必做
No food, no drink, no nothing.

554
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:27,044
我知道你要学习 还需要休息
I know you gotta study and get some sleep.

555
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,719
我只把你送回家再说句晚安
I'll take you to your house and say good night.

556
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:34,384
否则 要等太久才能见到你了
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.

557
00:40:41,241 --> 00:40:44,102
我想问你件事 你可能会说
I wanna ask you something and you're gonna say,

558
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:47,136
"这太快了 我还跟他不怎么熟
"Oh, it's too soon. I don't really know him well enough.

559
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,900
我们才见了几次面"
"We only been out a couple of times."

560
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:50,238
也没那么糟糕
Oh, it's nothing so bad.

561
00:40:50,263 --> 00:40:51,711
只是大多数男生 他们...
It's just something that most guys, they...

562
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:53,111
你问就是了
Please just ask.

563
00:40:53,237 --> 00:40:54,790
你已经要吓到我了
You're beginning to terrify me.

564
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:00,911
好吧 能请你来我家吃晚餐 见见我家人吗
Sure. Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?

565
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,914
就这事
That's it?

566
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:06,210
好的
I'd love to.

567
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:10,273
你喜欢意大利菜
You like Italian food?

568
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:12,299
不知道 从来没吃过
Don't know. I've never eaten it.

569
00:41:12,432 --> 00:41:13,948
那是世界上最好吃的食物
It's the best food in the world.

570
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:15,580
那我怎么会不喜欢呢
Well, why would I not like it?

571
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:19,222
你心情挺好的
You're in a good mood, huh?

572
00:41:19,597 --> 00:41:21,473
是啊 怎么了
Yes. Why?

573
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,583
只是... 我挺喜欢你这样
It's just... I like how you're being.

574
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:28,355
我不知道那个词是什么
I don't know the word,

575
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:30,178
就是你什么都答应的意思
when you go along with everything.

576
00:41:31,377 --> 00:41:34,124
- 好说话 - 是吗 好说话
- Amenable. - Yeah? Amenable?

577
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:37,739
好吧 趁着你这会好说话
OK, so while you're being amenable,

578
00:41:37,824 --> 00:41:41,374
你这周没课的时候 我们能去看场电影吗
can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night class?

579
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,997
我们去看两场电影
I'll sign up for two movies.

580
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:48,291
- 真的吗 - 嗯
- Really? - Yes.

581
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:50,548
即使第一次约会搞砸了
Even if the first date is a disaster,

582
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,159
你还有第二次机会
I'll give it another chance.

583
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,972
下一站是花园路
Parkway's next stop.

584
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:03,766
下一站是花园路
Parkway's next.

585
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:06,643
感觉上是这样
It certainly feels like it,

586
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:08,937
但这是我第一年来这儿 所以我也无法评价
but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.

587
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:10,188
祝贺你
Well, congratulations.

588
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:11,898
你在纽约活过了第一个冬天
You've survived your first New York winter.

589
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:13,410
不是很糟
Ah. Wasn't so bad.

590
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:15,141
是吗 爱尔兰比这儿更冷吗
Really? It's colder in Ireland?

591
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:16,499
不 这里更冷
Oh, no, it's colder here.

592
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:18,447
比这里冷是我们
Over here that's how

593
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,197
判断冬天有多冷的标准
we judge the winter, on how cold it is.

594
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:22,538
但你们有暖气 到哪里都有暖气
But you have heating, heating everywhere.

595
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:24,212
只有外面冷
You're only cold outside.

596
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,829
确实这样
I guess that's true.

597
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:29,494
- 谢谢你的帮助 - 祝您度过愉快的一天
- Thank you for your help. - Have a good day.

598
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,171
艾丽斯
Eilis.

599
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:37,382
你好像变了一个人 你是怎么做到的
You're like a different person. How did you do it?

600
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:38,756
也许我可以给
Maybe I can pass some advice

601
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:40,719
下个也想家的女孩一些建议
on to the next poor girl who feels that way.

602
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:43,221
我遇到了一个人 一个意大利的小伙子
I met somebody. An Italian fella.

603
00:42:43,347 --> 00:42:45,599
不 那我可不会把这建议跟她们说
Oh, no. I'm not passing that on.

604
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:48,140
我宁愿她们想家 也不要她们伤心
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.

605
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:50,496
他一直聊棒球吗
Does he talk about baseball all the time?

606
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:52,220
- 或者他的妈妈 - 不
- Or his mother? - No.

607
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,645
那就好好把握
Then keep him.

608
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:56,646
在纽约没有像他一样的意大利男人了
There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.

609
00:43:00,072 --> 00:43:01,499
等等
Hold it.

610
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:02,949
记住 你现在感觉很简单
Now, remember you're

611
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,868
是因为我们没有加任何酱料
getting off easy because we haven't got sauce.

612
00:43:04,952 --> 00:43:07,996
对 你要记住 酱料会溅得到处都是
Yeah, you have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere,

613
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,759
所以慢慢吃
so take it slowly.

614
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,834
如果我看到有任何问题 就会说"溅到了"
I'm gonna say "Splash" any time I see problems.

615
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:15,462
- 好主意 - 我现在可以开始了吗
- Good idea. - Can I start now?

616
00:43:15,852 --> 00:43:17,114
- 可以了 - 开始吧
- Yeah. - Go.

617
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,985
溅到了
Splash!

618
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,413
你刚才溅到了他的妈妈 爸爸 还有墙
You just splashed his mother, his father, and the walls.

619
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:39,152
再来一次
Let's go again.

620
00:43:41,193 --> 00:43:42,239
"亲爱的罗斯
"Dear Rose.

621
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:46,409
我想最重要的消息是 我交了一个男朋友
I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.

622
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,187
虽然他没有巴托奇的工作
He isn't as important as

623
00:43:48,188 --> 00:43:50,580
和我的夜校重要
Bartocci's and my night classes, I know that,

624
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:53,080
但我想告诉你发生的一切
but I want to tell you everything that's going on.

625
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,774
但请不要告诉妈妈
Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.

626
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:56,387
你知道她的脾气
You know what she's like.

627
00:43:57,642 --> 00:43:59,673
他很正派 也很善良
He's decent and kind,

628
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:01,967
他有一份工作 而且很努力
and he has a job and he works hard.

629
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:03,718
周三我们会去看电影
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays

630
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:06,847
周六他会带我去弗勒德神父的舞会
and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.

631
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:11,621
我每天都会想你和妈妈
I think of you and Mother every single day,

632
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:15,397
但托尼让我认识到 这里有自己的生活
but Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here

633
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:17,713
而在遇到他之前 我从没想过这一点
I didn't have before I met him.

634
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:19,989
那时我人在这里
My body was here,

635
00:44:20,235 --> 00:44:23,079
但心仍和你一起在爱尔兰
but my life was back in Ireland with you.

636
00:44:23,614 --> 00:44:25,949
现在 我的心有一半已经远渡重洋
Now it's halfway across the sea.

637
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:28,172
这种感觉太好了 对吧"
So that's something, isn't it?"

638
00:44:41,823 --> 00:44:43,758
我得提醒你注意弗兰基
Oh, and I'd better warn you about Frankie.

639
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:44,821
那个小个子吗
He's the little one?

640
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,740
对 他是个早熟的八岁小孩
Yeah, he's eight going on 18.

641
00:44:46,868 --> 00:44:49,581
他人很好也很聪明 但他会不停地瞎扯
I mean, he's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking

642
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,002
任何他想说的事情 都会和你扯
and he's talking about all the things he's gonna say to you.

643
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:53,751
- 什么事情 - 我不知道
- What sort of things? - We don't know.

644
00:44:53,776 --> 00:44:54,936
可能是任何事
It could be anything.

645
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:57,195
我试图收买他
I mean, I tried to pay him

646
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,080
让他出去和他的朋友们打球
money to go out and play ball with his friends

647
00:44:59,105 --> 00:45:00,765
而且我父亲也警告了他
and my dad, he threatened him,

648
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,278
但我觉得他就是想惹些事
but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble,

649
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:05,822
甚至还愿意为此挨打
so much so he'll happily take a beating.

650
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,535
这就是我的一家
This is us here.

651
00:45:08,452 --> 00:45:09,701
你准备好了吗
You ready?

652
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:27,484
你是从哪里学到那样吃意大利面的
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?

653
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:33,183
- 我学过 - 学过 上课学的吗
- I've been taking lessons. - Lessons? Like in a class?

654
00:45:33,423 --> 00:45:35,977
还可以学这个 那我也可以教你
You can do that? Maybe I could teach it.

655
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:39,282
不 和我住同一所公寓的女孩 叫戴安娜
No, no, Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me

656
00:45:39,307 --> 00:45:40,570
她给我做了一些意大利面
cooked me some spaghetti

657
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:43,068
还教我怎么吃不会弄得一团糟
and made me try and eat it without making a mess.

658
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:46,769
你们在爱尔兰吃什么 只吃爱尔兰炖肉吗
So what do you eat in Ireland? Just Irish stew?

659
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:48,189
不是的 我们还吃...
Not just. We eat...

660
00:45:48,214 --> 00:45:51,186
首先 我必须说 我们不喜欢爱尔兰人
So, first of all, I should say that we don't like Irish people.

661
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:52,804
- 怎么说话的 - 弗兰基
- Hey, watch it. - Frankie.

662
00:45:52,915 --> 00:45:56,038
怎么了 我们不喜欢 大家心知肚明
What? We don't. That is a well-known fact.

663
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:57,374
为什么 弗兰基
Why, Frankie?

664
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,731
因为一大帮爱尔兰人
Cos a big gang of Irish

665
00:45:58,732 --> 00:46:01,169
痛打了毛里奇奥一顿 还缝了针
beat Maurizio up and he had to get stitches,

666
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:02,787
但因为这附近的警察
and because all the cops around

667
00:46:02,788 --> 00:46:04,763
都是爱尔兰人 所以没人管这事
here are Irish nobody did anything about it.

668
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:07,422
这事我也有错
There's probably two sides to it.

669
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:09,427
我可能说了些不该说的话
I might have said something I shouldn't.

670
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:11,326
我现在想不起来了
You know, I can't remember now.

671
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,749
不 因为他们打了你
No, because they beat you up.

672
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:15,350
不管怎样 他们可能不都是爱尔兰人
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.

673
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:17,311
不 他们都是红头发和大长腿
No, they just had red hair and big legs.

674
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:18,734
好吧 站起来
All right, up.

675
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,222
- 啊 - 我们出去一下
- Ow! - Excuse us.

676
00:46:22,505 --> 00:46:25,026
我能偏袒他的唯一理由是 他是我们中间
All I can say in his defence is he's the only one of us

677
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:27,035
唯一可能上大学的人
who'll get a college education.

678
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,727
如果他懂得适时闭嘴的话
If he can keep his mouth shut.

679
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:32,158
托尼告诉我你在上大学
So, Tony tells me you go to college.

680
00:46:32,243 --> 00:46:34,995
只是夜校 我想做一个簿记员
Oh, just night classes. I want to be a book-keeper.

681
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:36,961
我也喜欢在商店工作
I like working in the shop well enough,

682
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,748
但不想在那里干一辈子
but I don't want to be there forever.

683
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:43,258
对不起 艾丽斯 我是个白痴
I'm sorry, Eilis. I'm an idiot.

684
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:45,921
我是一个粗鲁的笨蛋
I'm a rude idiot.

685
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:53,617
托尼在赛季开始时
So has Tony offered to take

686
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:55,974
带你去埃贝茨球场了吗
you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?

687
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,217
你居然喜欢棒球
You like baseball?

688
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:02,022
他从没提过道奇队吗
He never mentioned the Dodgers?

689
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:03,962
一次也没有吗
Not even once?

690
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,025
托尼 你怎么了
Tony, what's the matter with you?

691
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:07,360
你想知道为什么吗 太多这个了
You wanna know why? Too much of this.

692
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:10,168
如果你想在夏天见到他
Anyway, you'll have to go to

693
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:12,231
就必须去埃贝茨球场找他
Ebbets Field if you wanna see him in the summer.

694
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:13,700
这对你这么重要啊
They're that important to you?

695
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:15,716
这么说吧 如果我们的孩子
Put it this way, if our kids

696
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:17,852
最后支持洋基队或者巨人队
end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,

697
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,970
- 这会让我伤心的 - 我也会
- it'd break my heart. - Mine too.

698
00:47:23,744 --> 00:47:26,396
她没笑 托尼 看来为时已晚
She's not laughing, Tony. Think it's too late.

699
00:47:26,464 --> 00:47:27,965
她是个洋基队球迷
She's a Yanks fan.

700
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,842
你在说什么 你怎么了
What are you talking about? What's wrong with you?

701
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,137
她是个洋基队球迷
She's a Yanks fan.

702
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:57,202
我爱你
I love you.

703
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:01,859
我...
I...

704
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:07,659
晚上谢谢你 我很开心
Thank you for the evening. It was lovely.

705
00:48:30,294 --> 00:48:31,623
哦 对不起
Oh! Sorry.

706
00:48:34,198 --> 00:48:35,865
我用完了
I'd finished.

707
00:48:43,822 --> 00:48:45,625
希拉 我能问你一些事吗
Sheila, can I ask you something?

708
00:48:47,788 --> 00:48:49,250
你为什么没有结婚
Why aren't you married?

709
00:48:53,094 --> 00:48:55,760
因为我的丈夫有外遇 离开了我
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.

710
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:59,077
非常抱歉
Oh... I'm sorry.

711
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:03,768
你会再结婚吗
And, well, would you get married again?

712
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:05,776
- 有人向你求婚了吗 - 没有
- Has somebody asked you? - No.

713
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,467
大概没有
Not really.

714
00:49:08,962 --> 00:49:10,495
我不会追问"大概"是什么意思
I won't ask what that means.

715
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:13,508
我会再婚吗
Would I get married again?

716
00:49:13,676 --> 00:49:15,182
不 我想在寄宿公寓的厕所外
No, I wanna be waiting

717
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:17,571
永远等下去
outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.

718
00:49:18,181 --> 00:49:19,448
我当然想结了
Of course I do.

719
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:22,620
所以我才每周都去那个恶心的舞会
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.

720
00:49:22,989 --> 00:49:25,331
当某个脾气不好 头发乱糟糟的男人
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom

721
00:49:26,357 --> 00:49:30,026
在厕所里读报纸时
while some bad-tempered fella with hair growing out of his ears

722
00:49:30,294 --> 00:49:32,422
我想在自己的厕所外面等
reads the newspaper on the toilet.

723
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:36,407
然后我希望 还能回到这儿 和你聊天
Then I'll wish I was back here talking to you.

724
00:50:17,843 --> 00:50:19,302
艾丽斯
Eilis!

725
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:21,638
对不起
I'm sorry.

726
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:23,579
我没想到你会来
I didn't think you were coming.

727
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,826
我知道 我猜你也没想到
Yeah, I know. I thought you were gonna think that.

728
00:50:25,851 --> 00:50:28,228
因此无论如何我都要来这儿
That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.

729
00:50:28,664 --> 00:50:30,272
- 我要和你说一些事 - 你能...
- I need to say something to you. - Can you...

730
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:31,223
在到我们到基欧夫人的家之前
Can we just talk about

731
00:50:31,248 --> 00:50:33,399
我们能说点别的吗
something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?

732
00:50:33,484 --> 00:50:35,151
- 不是... - 求你了
- It's not... - Please.

733
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:39,197
所以...
So...

734
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,460
我早就该到了
Ten minutes before I'm supposed

735
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:44,670
但一个老女人的天花板里漏了污水
to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage

736
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:46,621
我站在及膝的污水里耽搁了十分钟
that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.

737
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:47,997
是的
Yeah.

738
00:50:48,252 --> 00:50:50,774
即使你想邀请我喝杯咖啡
Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee,

739
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,710
为了不熏到你 我只能拒绝
I'd have to say no for your sake.

740
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,754
那你怎么在十分钟里修好的
So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?

741
00:50:54,996 --> 00:50:57,637
没修好 我花了整整十分钟给那位女士解释
I didn't. I spent the whole 10 minutes explaining to the lady

742
00:50:57,662 --> 00:50:59,795
我必须去别的地方 而且我会回来的
I had to be somewhere and I'd be back,

743
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:01,336
但她还是不想让我走
and she don't wanna let me go.

744
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:04,013
所以污水还在从天花板往下喷吗
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?

745
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,348
嗯...
Oh...

746
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:06,944
六英寸和一英尺
Well, what's the difference

747
00:51:06,945 --> 00:51:09,185
有什么区别呢
between six inches of sewage and a foot?

748
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,772
能让我说想说的话了吗
Will you let me say what I want to say?

749
00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:15,900
我觉得你不会介意吧
I don't think you'll mind.

750
00:51:16,026 --> 00:51:17,110
说吧
Ok.

751
00:51:20,446 --> 00:51:24,019
你还记得 你带我回家吃完晚餐后
You remember that after I had dinner at your house,

752
00:51:24,044 --> 00:51:25,635
你告诉我 你爱我吗
you told me you loved me?

753
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,373
当时我不知道该怎么回应
Well, I didn't really know what to say.

754
00:51:32,284 --> 00:51:34,116
但现在我知道了
But I know what to say now.

755
00:51:36,371 --> 00:51:40,726
我已经考虑过了 我喜欢你
I have thought about you, and I like you.

756
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,729
我喜欢和你在一起
And I like being with you.

757
00:51:45,398 --> 00:51:46,720
还有...
And...

758
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:51,436
也许我和你感觉一样
maybe I feel the same way.

759
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:56,015
所以下次你再说你爱我时
So the next time you tell me you love me,

760
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,262
如果有下一次...
if there is a next time...

761
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,155
我会说 我也爱你
I'll say I love you too.

762
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:07,271
你说真的吗
Are you serious?

763
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:09,407
真的
Yes.

764
00:52:11,915 --> 00:52:13,333
天啊
Holy shit.

765
00:52:13,604 --> 00:52:14,860
原谅我说粗话
Excuse my language,

766
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:18,458
但我还以为 你要和我说些别的
but I thought we were having a different kind of talk.

767
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:21,299
我现在可以回家了吗
Can I go home now?

768
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,550
你爱我吗
You love me?

769
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:25,498
爱你 但别问我除此之外的东西
Yes, but don't ask me anything else,

770
00:52:25,523 --> 00:52:27,764
也别谈论我们的孩子是道奇队球迷
and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.

771
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:29,766
怎么 你想要喜欢洋基队的孩子吗
What, you want kids who like the Yankees?

772
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,301
托尼 求你了 别逼我
Tony, please, don't push me.

773
00:52:32,326 --> 00:52:33,831
好吧 对不起
All right. I'm sorry.

774
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:39,984
"亲爱的艾丽斯 谢谢你的尼龙袜
"Dear Eilis. Thank you so much for the nylons.

775
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:44,113
巴托奇的包装纸让它们看起来那么迷人
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.

776
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,806
和这里相比
It seems everything is so exciting

777
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,997
那里一切看起来都那么兴奋和新奇
and new compared to here.

778
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:52,911
我都等不及 让你来向我展示一切
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.

779
00:52:56,726 --> 00:52:58,069
艾丽斯
Oh, Eilis,

780
00:52:59,027 --> 00:53:02,131
记住 即使我不在你身边 我也和你在一起"
you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not."

781
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:25,527
好吧...
Well...

782
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:30,827
我只能这么说 你棒极了
You're marvellous, that's all I have to say.

783
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:34,746
看起来 你不仅通过了那些考试
It looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.

784
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:37,774
而且考得很好
No. You flew through them.

785
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,062
我都记不起上一次
I can't remember the last

786
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:40,909
有人带来好消息 是什么时候了
time anyone came in here with good news.

787
00:53:41,178 --> 00:53:42,497
我攒了一些钱
I've saved some money.

788
00:53:42,758 --> 00:53:43,960
我可以支付下一年的学费
I'll be able to pay for next

789
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:46,031
还能还给你去年的学费
year's tuition and pay you back for last year.

790
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,654
学费是一个教区居民付的
One of my parishioners paid.

791
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:51,266
他想要做一些好事 而我不会告诉你为什么
He needed to do something for mankind and I won't tell you why.

792
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:52,792
因为他还没有走出困境
He's not out of the woods yet either,

793
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:54,225
所以他还可以勉强交明年的学费
so he can cough up for next year, too.

794
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:56,136
我想知道 他遇到什么困难了
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.

795
00:53:56,161 --> 00:53:59,121
当然 你会知道的 但我不会告诉你
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.

796
00:54:00,397 --> 00:54:03,019
有资格证书和男朋友了 艾丽斯
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.

797
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:04,071
你不再是去年冬天
You're not the miserable

798
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:06,259
那个可怜想家的女孩了
young girl who wanted to go home last winter.

799
00:54:06,572 --> 00:54:08,422
感觉像多年以前的事了
It seems like years ago.

800
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:12,910
我想这是第一次
Now, I think this is the first time

801
00:54:13,226 --> 00:54:18,234
在我这里住的女孩通过考试
any girl of mine has ever passed an exam while living here.

802
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:23,875
- 你告诉托尼了吗 艾丽斯 - 当然
- Have you told Tony yet, Eilis? - Of course.

803
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:25,341
他打算带你出去庆祝吗
And is he taking you out to celebrate?

804
00:54:25,516 --> 00:54:27,675
我们打算周末去科尼岛
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.

805
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:30,157
- 天啊 - 什么意思
- Oh, boy. - What does that mean?

806
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:31,525
你有泳衣吗
Do you have a bathing costume?

807
00:54:31,812 --> 00:54:33,848
- 没有 我打算去... - 你有墨镜吗
- No, I was going to... - Do you have sunglasses?

808
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:35,913
- 没有 - 你需要墨镜
- No. - You need sunglasses.

809
00:54:35,986 --> 00:54:37,507
我听说 如果你去海滩上不戴墨镜
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year,

810
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,061
人们会讨论你
people'll talk about you.

811
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,942
那他们到底会说什么 希拉
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?

812
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:43,774
这就是问题所在 基欧夫人
That's the thing, Mrs Kehoe.

813
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:47,010
你永远不会知道 因为他们不会当面说
You'd never know cos they'd never say it to your face.

814
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:52,143
上帝啊 但戴安娜说得对 艾丽斯
Oh, dear God. Diana's right, though, Eilis.

815
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:54,076
你需要好好考虑你的泳衣
You need to think carefully about your costume.

816
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,431
这是托尼最想看你穿的衣服
It's the most Tony will ever

817
00:54:55,432 --> 00:54:57,747
而你也不想让他失望
have seen of you and you don't want to put him off.

818
00:55:02,419 --> 00:55:03,753
你那个地方需要剃毛
You'll have to shave down there.

819
00:55:03,837 --> 00:55:05,129
我给你一个剃须刀就可以搞定了
I'll give you a razor that'll do the trick.

820
00:55:10,969 --> 00:55:12,428
目前看起来你没什么问题
You're all right there for the moment.

821
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:14,805
大多数意大利男人都喜欢丰满的身材
And most Italian men appreciate a fuller figure.

822
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:17,767
但夏天你要注意
But watch yourself over the summer.

823
00:55:19,436 --> 00:55:21,938
你的皮肤很白 黑色太暗了 我们试试绿色吧
Black's too dark for your pale skin. Let's see you in the green.

824
00:56:02,396 --> 00:56:03,454
你为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you tell me

825
00:56:03,455 --> 00:56:05,523
要把泳衣穿在衣服下面呢
to put my costume on underneath my clothes?

826
00:56:05,649 --> 00:56:07,358
我以为你知道
I thought you'd know.

827
00:56:09,903 --> 00:56:11,904
我好了
Right, I'm ready.

828
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,039
- 托尼 - 怎么了
- Tony. - What?

829
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:24,208
来
Come on.

830
00:56:25,544 --> 00:56:28,546
"亲爱的罗斯 谢谢你的信
"Dear Rose. Thank you for your letter.

831
00:56:28,672 --> 00:56:31,090
我很高兴听到你的高尔夫比赛
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.

832
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:33,426
你一定非常高兴吧
You must have been really pleased.

833
00:56:34,011 --> 00:56:37,555
我还是思念你和妈妈 每天都想你
I still miss you and Mother and think about you every day,

834
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:39,055
我想我可以说
but I think I can say that

835
00:56:39,056 --> 00:56:41,434
这是来美国后第一次
for the first time since I've been in America

836
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:43,227
我真的感到开心
I'm really happy.

837
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:46,230
这归功于托尼
This has a lot to do with Tony.

838
00:56:46,356 --> 00:56:48,983
周末他带我去看布鲁克林道奇队
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers,

839
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:51,444
这是他喜欢的棒球队
the baseball team he loves.

840
00:56:51,528 --> 00:56:53,696
他们输球了 他很生气
They lost, so he was annoyed.

841
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,782
我也已经开始找一份白领工作了
But I've also started to look for office work too.

842
00:56:56,867 --> 00:57:00,786
这周我在布鲁克林的纺织厂有一个面试"
I had an interview this week at a textile firm here in Brooklyn."

843
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:02,121
罗斯
Rose.

844
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:05,458
"谁会想到一个家庭里有两个记簿员呢"
"Who'd have thought there would be two book-keepers in the family?"

845
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:06,584
罗斯
Rose.

846
00:57:10,213 --> 00:57:13,424
"我很快就能回家看你和妈妈了"
"I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and Mammy."

847
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:18,220
罗斯
Rose?

848
00:57:21,933 --> 00:57:22,975
罗斯
Rose.

849
00:57:23,226 --> 00:57:24,560
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

850
00:57:26,938 --> 00:57:29,732
罗斯 哦 罗斯
Rose! Oh, Rose!

851
00:57:47,334 --> 00:57:48,751
稍等
One moment.

852
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,607
事发突然
It was sudden.

853
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,612
我想也许她生病了 而且她知道自己病了
I think perhaps she was ill, and she knew she was ill,

854
00:58:16,822 --> 00:58:19,031
但她没有告诉任何人
and she didn't tell anybody.

855
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:26,497
- 接下会来怎样 - 还能怎么样
- What'll happen? - What can happen?

856
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:31,293
- 他们什么时候埋葬她 - 明天
- When will they bury her? - Tomorrow.

857
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:36,132
- 可我不在啊 - 不用你在
- Without me? - Without you.

858
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:39,343
你离得太远了 艾丽斯
You're too far away, Eilis.

859
00:58:44,307 --> 00:58:46,392
我为什么要来这里
Why did I ever come here?

860
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:49,228
罗斯希望你有更好的生活
Rose wanted a better life for you.

861
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:50,980
她喜欢你现在的生活状态
She loved how well you were doing.

862
00:58:51,148 --> 00:58:53,315
但我不能再见到她了
But I'll never see her again.

863
00:58:57,195 --> 00:58:59,113
我说的没错吧 神父
That's right, isn't it, Father?

864
00:58:59,197 --> 00:59:01,323
我再也见不到她了
I'll never see her again.

865
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:04,160
你会与她相见的
You know that I think you will.

866
00:59:04,703 --> 00:59:05,875
在你余生的每一天
And that she'll be watching

867
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,830
她都会注视着你
over you every day for the rest of your life.

868
00:59:35,942 --> 00:59:37,943
你好 妈妈
Hello. Mammy?

869
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:44,200
我听不太清
I can't really hear you.

870
00:59:46,536 --> 00:59:48,704
雨迟迟没下
Well, the rain held off anyway.

871
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:54,043
她高尔夫俱乐部的人都来了 一个也没少
And the whole of her golf club came, every single one of them.

872
00:59:54,878 --> 00:59:57,213
满屋都是人
We had a real houseful afterwards.

873
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,884
还在吗
Are you still there?

874
01:00:02,886 --> 01:00:04,220
我在
Yes.

875
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:09,391
艾丽斯 大伙都很爱她
People really loved her, Eilis.

876
01:00:10,393 --> 01:00:13,229
工作伙伴 邻居们 大家都喜欢她
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.

877
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:18,234
大伙都不知道怎么安慰我
Nobody knew what to say to me.

878
01:00:21,738 --> 01:00:24,114
你爸去世时 我跟自己说
When your daddy died, I said to myself

879
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:26,575
我还有你们俩 不要太难过
that I shouldn't grieve too much because I had the two of you.

880
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:29,370
你远去美国时
And then when you went to America,

881
01:00:29,454 --> 01:00:32,790
我也这样跟自己说 因为我还有你姐姐
I told myself the same thing because she was here with me.

882
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:34,575
但现在大家都不在了
But everyone's gone,

883
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:36,126
艾丽斯 只剩下我一个人
Eilis. I have nobody.

884
01:00:57,107 --> 01:00:59,024
托尼 我受不了了
I can't bear it, Tony.

885
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:08,951
你是想回家吧
You wanna go home, I guess.

886
01:01:12,497 --> 01:01:15,457
要是我走了 你会怎么办
How would it be for you if I did go home?

887
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,461
我每天都会不安
I'd be afraid every single day.

888
01:01:19,963 --> 01:01:22,464
怕我不回来
Afraid that I wouldn't come back?

889
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:24,300
是的
Yeah.

890
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:26,510
但家总归是家
But home is home.

891
01:01:32,475 --> 01:01:34,476
我不确定那还是不是我的家
I'm not sure I have a home any more.

892
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,152
你明天不去上班了吧
You're not going to work tomorrow, are you?

893
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:46,864
弥撒之后 我能带你出去玩吗
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?

894
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:01,253
就是这里了
This is it.

895
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:05,716
可能的话 我们要在这建五座房子
We're gonna build five houses here if we can

896
01:02:05,842 --> 01:02:08,427
要给爸妈一套
and Mom and Dad, they're gonna have one

897
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:11,597
因为妈妈总想要个带后院的房子
cos Ma always wanted a house with a backyard.

898
01:02:11,681 --> 01:02:13,432
三套卖了
We'll sell three.

899
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:16,018
还剩一套
And the other one,

900
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:18,604
我兄弟问我想不想要
my brothers, they asked me if I wanted it

901
01:02:18,688 --> 01:02:20,648
我说我想要
and I said that I did.

902
01:02:20,732 --> 01:02:24,051
我想说的是
So I guess what I'm saying is,

903
01:02:24,093 --> 01:02:25,778
你想住在长岛吗
you wanna live out here on Long Island?

904
01:02:26,529 --> 01:02:28,614
我知道现在说这些还早
I mean, I know it doesn't look like much right now,

905
01:02:28,698 --> 01:02:30,699
但这附近的地都卖完了
but all the land around here has been sold,

906
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:32,618
所以我们不会没有邻居的
so we wouldn't be on our own,

907
01:02:32,702 --> 01:02:36,705
以后还会有电话线 电和其他的一切
and there'd be telephone cables and electricity, everything.

908
01:02:44,756 --> 01:02:47,049
我们要创建家公司
We're gonna set up a company.

909
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:50,302
建筑公司 我们三个人
A building company, the three of us.

910
01:02:50,387 --> 01:02:52,162
我负责管道工程
And I'm gonna do the plumbing

911
01:02:52,413 --> 01:02:54,306
劳伦斯管木工活...
and Laurence'll do the carpentry and...

912
01:03:01,564 --> 01:03:03,649
别不说话啊
Don't go all quiet on me.

913
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:06,777
至少告诉我你会考虑一下
At least tell me you'll think about it.

914
01:03:11,408 --> 01:03:13,742
这根本不用考虑
I don't need to think about it.

915
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:06,712
我就去一个月
It's just for a month or so.

916
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:10,507
这样会让她好受些
I know it'd make her feel a little better.

917
01:04:20,143 --> 01:04:22,561
走之前嫁给我好吗
Will you marry me before you leave?

918
01:04:26,149 --> 01:04:28,484
你不相信我会回来吗
You don't trust me to come back?

919
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:32,571
嫁给我吧
Marry me.

920
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,657
嫁给我吧
Marry me.

921
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:38,452
不必告诉别人
We don't have to tell anybody.

922
01:04:38,536 --> 01:04:42,081
很快办个手续 不跟别人说
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.

923
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:47,169
你为什么想结婚
Why do you want to do it?

924
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:51,090
如果不这样的话 我会疯掉的
Because if we don't, I'm gonna go crazy.

925
01:04:56,888 --> 01:04:59,348
我的承诺就没有用吗
Would a promise not be the same?

926
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:05,562
要是你能许诺的话 那结婚也算不了什么
If you can promise, you can easily do this.

927
01:05:49,816 --> 01:05:53,152
这就是你住的地方
So this is it. This is where you live.

928
01:05:53,653 --> 01:05:56,196
是的 要是你弄出响声
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise,

929
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:57,489
她会赶我走的
she'll evict me.

930
01:07:31,042 --> 01:07:33,252
现在你不用担心了
There's no point in worrying now.

931
01:07:35,672 --> 01:07:37,339
留在我身边
Stay with me.

932
01:08:07,745 --> 01:08:09,413
要玩吗
You wanna play?

933
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:11,623
- 可以啊 - 好的 来吧
- Yeah, sure. - All right, here we go.

934
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:13,875
球棒马上就好
One bat coming up, huh?

935
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:16,962
我拿着这个 准备好了没 举棒
I'll take that. All right, you ready? Hands up.

936
01:08:17,088 --> 01:08:18,630
- 好 - 球来了
- Yeah. - All right.

937
01:08:18,715 --> 01:08:20,924
正好在第三垒线上
Boom. Oh! Right down the third base line.

938
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,134
他是不是很烦人
Is he annoying you?

939
01:08:22,218 --> 01:08:24,219
- 我可被他烦到了 - 没有 没有
- Cos he was annoying me. - No, no, no, no.

940
01:08:24,345 --> 01:08:26,513
我有个弟弟和他一样大
I got a brother the exact same age.

941
01:08:26,597 --> 01:08:29,016
- 你是爱尔兰人 - 很明显吗
- Hey, are you Irish? - Is it so obvious?

942
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,092
我要娶一个爱尔兰女孩
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl,

943
01:08:31,093 --> 01:08:32,561
所以我更注意这一点
so I guess I notice it more.

944
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:34,062
布鲁克林有很多爱尔兰人
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.

945
01:08:34,188 --> 01:08:36,732
感觉老家都没几个人了
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.

946
01:08:36,858 --> 01:08:37,858
你爱人住在哪
Where's your girl from?

947
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:39,609
威克斯福德郡的恩尼斯柯西
Enniscorthy in County Wexford.

948
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:41,403
我妻子在那儿有亲戚
My wife has family there.

949
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:43,530
艾丽斯 过来一下
Hey, Eilis. Come here a sec.

950
01:08:43,614 --> 01:08:47,117
安东尼·费欧雷洛和艾丽斯·莱西
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.

951
01:08:47,243 --> 01:08:49,536
- 好运 - 谢谢
- Good luck. - Thank you.

952
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,955
走吧 快过来 走吧
Come on, come over here. Come on.

953
01:09:00,465 --> 01:09:03,050
要跟孩子们说这些吗
Will we ever tell our children we did this?

954
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:07,220
还是留到纪念日再说吧
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.

955
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:11,099
不知道他们会怎么想
I wonder what they'll think of it.

956
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:39,419
- 南希 - 你真美
- Nancy. - You look so glamorous.

957
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,505
我跟你说了的
I told you so.

958
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:42,964
罗斯的死 请节哀
I'm so sorry about Rose.

959
01:09:43,758 --> 01:09:45,008
谢谢
Thank you.

960
01:09:45,176 --> 01:09:46,635
你怎么样了
How are you?

961
01:09:48,304 --> 01:09:49,304
不会吧
No.

962
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,681
我早知道了 但我想让南希自己告诉你
I knew, but I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.

963
01:09:51,808 --> 01:09:53,725
你能参加我的婚礼我很开心
I'm so glad you can come to the wedding.

964
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:54,976
我可以去吗
Can I?

965
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:58,313
你母亲替你收下了邀请函
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.

966
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:00,649
- 什么时候 - 八月二十七号
- When is it? - The 27th of August.

967
01:10:00,817 --> 01:10:03,235
明晚陪我和乔治出去吧
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?

968
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:04,945
安妮特也想见你
Annette wants to see you, too.

969
01:10:05,029 --> 01:10:07,406
你去吧 我回去给你把钥匙
Oh, I don't mind. I'll have to find you a key.

970
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,949
我不想让你吵醒我
I don't want you getting me out of bed.

971
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:12,077
我们想听你在纽约的事
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.

972
01:10:12,161 --> 01:10:14,329
我尽量别没话说就好
I'll try and think of something to say.

973
01:10:21,963 --> 01:10:24,673
我订了二十一号回纽约的票
I'm booked to go back to New York on the 21st.

974
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:29,052
你可以再呆一周 参加你闺蜜的婚礼
Well, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.

975
01:11:06,048 --> 01:11:09,217
真不敢相信 我嫁给了个你不认识的人
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.

976
01:11:14,515 --> 01:11:16,516
但你会喜欢他的
But you'd like him.

977
01:11:17,393 --> 01:11:19,227
我感觉你会的
I know you would.

978
01:11:22,064 --> 01:11:23,773
他对我很好
He's sweet.

979
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:26,401
为人风趣
And he's funny.

980
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:30,071
他那双漂亮的眼睛...
And he's got these wonderful eyes that...

981
01:11:41,751 --> 01:11:44,419
事情不这样发展就好了
I wish everything were different.

982
01:12:04,106 --> 01:12:06,942
到库什的奥图尔夫人了
So, now, Mrs O'Toole from Cush.

983
01:12:07,068 --> 01:12:08,652
真的要这么做吗
Do we really have to do this?

984
01:12:08,778 --> 01:12:10,095
收到吊唁信
Getting a letter of condolence

985
01:12:10,096 --> 01:12:12,072
和收到生日礼物可不一样
isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?

986
01:12:12,156 --> 01:12:13,597
要是库什的奥图尔夫人
What if Mrs O'Toole from Cush

987
01:12:13,598 --> 01:12:15,784
回信感谢你怎么办
writes back to thank you for your thank you?

988
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:16,993
那我就再谢谢她
Then I'll thank her.

989
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:19,496
余生都在写这些信 你很开心吗
And you'd be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?

990
01:12:19,622 --> 01:12:21,273
反正我也闲得无聊
It's not as if I've anything else to do

991
01:12:21,857 --> 01:12:22,666
也没人和我聊天
or anybody else to talk to.

992
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:25,752
还不如写信给库什的奥图尔夫人
It might as well be Mrs O'Toole from Cush.

993
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:28,380
你想要我说什么
What do you want me to say?

994
01:12:30,466 --> 01:12:33,969
- 肯定是南希和安妮特 - 你去吧
- That'll be Nancy and Annette. - Off you go.

995
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:39,474
玩得开心
Enjoy yourself.

996
01:12:56,284 --> 01:12:57,993
艾丽斯 这位是吉姆·法雷尔
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.

997
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:01,329
见到你我很高兴
It's a great pleasure to meet you.

998
01:13:05,059 --> 01:13:06,977
我们可以去康诺特酒店的酒吧
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.

999
01:13:07,002 --> 01:13:09,165
在那里可能会有些橄榄球俱乐部的人
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.

1000
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:10,334
可以
Ok.

1001
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:12,845
你一定要和
Do you have to be with

1002
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:15,384
橄榄球俱乐部的人在一起吗
other fellas from the rugby club all the time?

1003
01:13:15,845 --> 01:13:17,206
不是的
No.

1004
01:13:18,472 --> 01:13:21,318
但南希说我们不能和你说话
But Nancy told us we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you

1005
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:22,999
因为你们姐妹俩要叙叙旧
cos you have too much to say to each other,

1006
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,853
我们只是去找些伴
so we're just looking for company.

1007
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:26,688
原来如此
Oh, well.

1008
01:13:26,894 --> 01:13:29,095
艾丽斯 你不喜欢打橄榄球的人吗
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?

1009
01:13:29,152 --> 01:13:30,859
也不能这么说 乔治
I don't particularly, George.

1010
01:13:31,254 --> 01:13:32,658
我去美国的时候
When I first went to America,

1011
01:13:32,683 --> 01:13:36,047
想念恩尼斯柯西的一切 除了橄榄球
I missed every single thing about Enniscorthy except one.

1012
01:13:36,173 --> 01:13:37,532
我们无时无刻都在改变
We're not all the same.

1013
01:13:37,573 --> 01:13:39,073
可你看起来没怎么变啊
You all look the same.

1014
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:41,995
西装 喜欢摸发油 都一样
It's the blazer and the hair oil.

1015
01:13:51,234 --> 01:13:52,213
南希
Nancy.

1016
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:56,998
安妮特呢 还有他怎么来了
Where's Annette? And why has he come?

1017
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,013
他人不错 别为难他
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.

1018
01:14:00,385 --> 01:14:01,540
这是那个跟凯瑟琳·卡西迪
Is this the same Jim Farrell

1019
01:14:01,565 --> 01:14:03,208
订婚了的吉姆·法雷尔吗
that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?

1020
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:05,352
- 她人呢 - 他取消婚约了
- What happened to her? - He broke it off.

1021
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:07,104
他觉得她对待感情不够认真
He didn't think she was serious about him.

1022
01:14:07,266 --> 01:14:10,065
他伤心了一阵子 但现在都忘了她
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.

1023
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:13,809
南希 我会回美国的
Nancy, I'm... I'm going back.

1024
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:17,059
在这里就开心地玩吧 好吗
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?

1025
01:14:17,769 --> 01:14:19,407
我们走 乔治
Come on, George.

1026
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:24,267
你母亲还好吧
How's your mother?

1027
01:14:25,247 --> 01:14:28,458
她... 很伤心
She's... Well, she's sad.

1028
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:31,378
一夜之间 老了很多
She's got much older very quickly.

1029
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,867
那种事确实让人很难过
It was a terrible thing.

1030
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:35,632
我们都去了葬礼弥撒
We all went to the funeral Mass,

1031
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:37,534
我们全家都去了
Mother and Father and myself.

1032
01:14:38,204 --> 01:14:39,719
这我倒不知道
I didn't know that.

1033
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,721
我妈和你姐姐一起打高尔夫
My mother played golf with her, you know.

1034
01:14:41,952 --> 01:14:43,433
我妈很喜欢她
She was very fond of her.

1035
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:45,100
真是...
It was...

1036
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:47,363
这是从我记事起
It was the saddest thing

1037
01:14:47,388 --> 01:14:49,484
镇上发生过最痛心的事
to happen in the town that I can remember.

1038
01:14:51,167 --> 01:14:52,351
谢谢
Thank you.

1039
01:14:54,068 --> 01:14:55,717
快来 你们俩
Come on, you two.

1040
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:02,158
摩天大楼呢
And what about the skyscrapers?

1041
01:15:02,421 --> 01:15:03,910
那是在曼哈顿
Ah, but that's Manhattan.

1042
01:15:03,994 --> 01:15:06,393
我工作和生活都在布鲁克林
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn,

1043
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,419
出门的话 也是在布鲁克林
and if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.

1044
01:15:08,521 --> 01:15:10,473
摩天大楼都在河对面
All the skyscrapers are across the river.

1045
01:15:10,613 --> 01:15:12,575
你说起来好像也没多好
You don't make it sound very glamorous.

1046
01:15:12,784 --> 01:15:13,654
是不怎么样
It's not, really.

1047
01:15:13,787 --> 01:15:15,300
别这样说 你工作的百货商店
Not even, what do you call it,

1048
01:15:15,325 --> 01:15:16,698
叫什么来着
the department store where you work?

1049
01:15:16,723 --> 01:15:19,536
叫巴托奇 卖些招人喜欢小玩意
Oh, Bartocci's? Well, it sells lovely things.

1050
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:22,470
很多我都买不起 况且我也不喜欢那份工作
But I can't afford many of them and I don't like the work, so...

1051
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,305
那你喜欢做什么
What would you like to do?

1052
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:27,225
我想做罗斯的工作
I want to do what Rose did.

1053
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:30,070
我想在办公室里上班 跟数字打交道
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.

1054
01:15:30,095 --> 01:15:31,521
那你可以去戴维斯那里看看
Well, you should call in at Davis's.

1055
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:33,857
他们还没找到接替罗斯的人
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.

1056
01:15:33,983 --> 01:15:36,651
婚礼过后我就要回纽约了
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.

1057
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:39,342
那你可以顺便赚些小钱
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.

1058
01:15:39,855 --> 01:15:41,197
你去的话 他们会很高兴的
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.

1059
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:43,131
你就是想要她留下来
You just want her to stay.

1060
01:15:45,728 --> 01:15:47,152
这是为艾丽斯着想
I'm only thinking of Eilis.

1061
01:15:47,305 --> 01:15:50,162
听见了没 艾丽斯 他在为你着想
Do you hear that, Eilis? He's only thinking of you.

1062
01:15:58,279 --> 01:15:59,692
没错 没错
That's it, that's it.

1063
01:15:59,717 --> 01:16:02,023
记得吗 戈尔甘夫人都没察觉到
Remember, Mrs Grogan didn't notice a thing.

1064
01:16:07,016 --> 01:16:08,625
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

1065
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:09,726
再见
See you.

1066
01:16:28,725 --> 01:16:30,121
晚上过得怎样
How was your evening?

1067
01:16:30,802 --> 01:16:32,553
很开心 谢谢关心
It was very nice, thank you.

1068
01:16:32,866 --> 01:16:35,154
我看车里面那个是吉姆·法雷尔吗
Was that Jim Farrell I saw in the car with them?

1069
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:37,378
是的
It was.

1070
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:38,669
他父母要搬走了
His parents are moving, you know.

1071
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:39,798
都要退休回乡下了
They're retiring to the country.

1072
01:16:39,882 --> 01:16:41,716
马上他就能独自住一栋大房子了
He'll be in that big house on his own.

1073
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,952
是吗
Is that right?

1074
01:16:45,178 --> 01:16:46,913
他是个不错的小伙子
He's a catch for someone.

1075
01:16:49,214 --> 01:16:50,396
晚安 妈妈
Good night, Mammy.

1076
01:17:02,611 --> 01:17:03,357
你好 艾丽斯
Hello, Eilis.

1077
01:17:03,358 --> 01:17:04,572
你好啊 布伦南夫人
Hello, Mrs Brennan.

1078
01:17:05,032 --> 01:17:06,746
真漂亮
Quite the star.

1079
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:16,292
- 你终于回来了 - 怎么了
- Thank goodness you're back. - What's the matter?

1080
01:17:16,418 --> 01:17:17,862
戴维斯的人刚来了
A lad from Davis's came round.

1081
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:19,561
他们财务部出了点问题
They have a problem in their accounts department.

1082
01:17:19,586 --> 01:17:20,716
他们叫你马上过去
They need you up there straightaway.

1083
01:17:20,741 --> 01:17:23,104
是吗 我先把买的东西放好
Is that all? I'll just put the shopping away.

1084
01:17:23,129 --> 01:17:24,194
别管了
No, no, leave it.

1085
01:17:24,219 --> 01:17:25,577
那小伙子说 马上去
Straightaway, the young fella said.

1086
01:17:25,602 --> 01:17:27,267
妈妈 他说什么不重要
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother.

1087
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,538
我又不是雇员 我这是在帮忙
I'm not an employee. I'd be doing them a favour.

1088
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:31,810
我来管这些东西
Please, let me do the shopping.

1089
01:17:40,357 --> 01:17:42,711
现在是我们的旺季
The problem is that it's our busy season,

1090
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:45,849
上周工人和司机都加了班
so all the mill workers and drivers did overtime last week.

1091
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,947
他们都填了加班凭证
Well, they filled out the overtime slips,

1092
01:17:48,972 --> 01:17:49,892
但这里没人
but there's been nobody here

1093
01:17:49,893 --> 01:17:52,382
处理这些凭证 也没人处理工资单
to work it all out and to add to the wage slips,

1094
01:17:52,407 --> 01:17:54,514
有员工都开始抱怨了
and some of the men have started to complain,

1095
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,915
我也不能怪他们
and I can't blame them.

1096
01:17:56,111 --> 01:17:58,612
你也看见了 现在一团糟
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.

1097
01:18:01,785 --> 01:18:03,721
给我几个小时
Well, if you leave me for a couple of hours,

1098
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:06,424
我就能弄出套系统 之后来接班的人
I can work out a system so that whoever comes in after me

1099
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:07,723
也不会出问题
won't have any trouble.

1100
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,094
你好 艾丽斯
Hello, Eilis.

1101
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,138
玛利亚一直在和我说
Maria has been telling

1102
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:22,101
你的工作做得很好
me you've done the most marvellous job here.

1103
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,225
谢谢夸奖
Thank you.

1104
01:18:23,434 --> 01:18:24,331
我们应该预料到的
We should have known you would,

1105
01:18:24,356 --> 01:18:26,212
你毕竟是罗斯的妹妹
of course. You're Rose's sister, after all.

1106
01:18:26,403 --> 01:18:28,281
听说你有财务簿记的证书
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping.

1107
01:18:28,365 --> 01:18:30,164
是美国的簿记证书吗
Is it American book-keeping?

1108
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:31,967
证书是在美国拿的
I got the certificate in America,

1109
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:33,995
两套体系很相似
but the two systems are very similar.

1110
01:18:34,478 --> 01:18:37,219
旺季的时候 我们很需要人来
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on

1111
01:18:37,244 --> 01:18:38,583
处理工资之类的事
during the busy season.

1112
01:18:38,851 --> 01:18:41,839
我希望你继续在我们这儿兼职
So I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.

1113
01:18:41,864 --> 01:18:43,807
你先做着 然后我们再说
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.

1114
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:46,476
我马上就要回美国了
I'll be going back to the United States soon.

1115
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:47,343
像我说的那样
As I say,

1116
01:18:47,368 --> 01:18:49,913
不管怎样 在做最后决定之前
let's you and I speak again before we make any firm decisions

1117
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,237
我们俩谈一次
one way or the other.

1118
01:18:53,338 --> 01:18:56,400
好的 布朗先生 谢谢你
Yes, Mr Brown. Of course. Thank you.

1119
01:18:56,685 --> 01:18:59,598
要是你去找玛利亚 她会付给你今天的工钱
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.

1120
01:20:02,534 --> 01:20:03,921
我都想不起来了
I'd forgotten.

1121
01:20:04,519 --> 01:20:05,557
什么
What?

1122
01:20:06,831 --> 01:20:07,903
这个
This.

1123
01:20:10,189 --> 01:20:12,156
布鲁克林也有沙滩呀
You have beaches in Brooklyn.

1124
01:20:12,882 --> 01:20:15,304
是啊 但那里很挤
Yes, but they're just very crowded.

1125
01:20:16,171 --> 01:20:19,032
晚点这里可能就有不少人了
There'll probably be quite a few walkers along here later.

1126
01:20:20,129 --> 01:20:21,140
是啊
Yes.

1127
01:20:21,938 --> 01:20:23,706
但还是不一样
It's still not the same.

1128
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:26,782
我想也是
I'm sure it's not.

1129
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:31,433
我们对世界其他地区一无所知
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.

1130
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:35,116
对你来说 我们肯定特别无知吧
We must seem very backward to you now.

1131
01:20:35,534 --> 01:20:36,868
当然不是了
Of course not.

1132
01:20:37,037 --> 01:20:40,393
你看起来既沉着 又有教养 还很有魅力
You seem calm and civilised and charming.

1133
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:48,296
快来
Come on!

1134
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,279
我母亲想要你知道
My mother wanted you to know

1135
01:20:57,304 --> 01:21:00,641
高尔夫俱乐部 要以罗斯的名字设立一个奖项
that the golf club is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.

1136
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:04,767
一个为得分最高的
A special trophy for the

1137
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,315
俱乐部新人女士准备的特殊奖项
best score by a lady newcomer at the club.

1138
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:11,740
我母亲说她一直对新人很友善
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.

1139
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:16,182
希望你开心
I hope you're pleased.

1140
01:21:19,522 --> 01:21:20,583
是啊
Yes.

1141
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,166
当然开心了
Of course.

1142
01:21:25,495 --> 01:21:31,032
所以每年都会有人赢得罗斯·莱西奖吗
So every year someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?

1143
01:21:31,997 --> 01:21:33,476
对啊 每年都会有
Yeah, every year,

1144
01:21:34,194 --> 01:21:36,052
只要高尔夫俱乐部还在
as long as there's a golf club.

1145
01:21:40,453 --> 01:21:44,543
我想她会很乐意 邀请你前来
And I think she'd like you to come along

1146
01:21:44,568 --> 01:21:46,524
给首位获胜者颁奖
and present it to the first winner.

1147
01:21:50,358 --> 01:21:51,470
而且 顺便说一句
Yeah, and my mother would like to

1148
01:21:51,495 --> 01:21:53,045
我母亲也很乐意见你一面的
meet you too, by the way.

1149
01:21:55,097 --> 01:21:58,006
我该安排个时间 邀请你过来喝茶
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.

1150
01:21:59,453 --> 01:22:01,661
谢谢 我很乐意过去
Thank you. I'd like that.

1151
01:22:07,225 --> 01:22:09,585
真希望在我离开这里之前 就能这样
I wish it had been like this before I went.

1152
01:22:10,648 --> 01:22:12,183
在罗斯去世前
Before Rose died.

1153
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:14,647
哪样
Like what?

1154
01:22:15,946 --> 01:22:18,094
之前我在这一无所有
There was nothing here for me before

1155
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,069
而现在我有了份工作 而且...
and now I have a job and...

1156
01:22:20,984 --> 01:22:22,098
这里好吗
Here?

1157
01:22:37,523 --> 01:22:38,698
这是你从美国学来的招吗
Is that an American trick?

1158
01:22:38,884 --> 01:22:40,852
对啊 很棒吧 对吗
Yes. It's a good one, isn't it?

1159
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:43,979
不过 我们以前从没想到过
It's depressing, though,

1160
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:46,205
还能这样 真令人沮丧 对吗
that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?

1161
01:22:46,353 --> 01:22:49,000
我是说 他们这样做多久了
I mean, how long have they known about it?

1162
01:22:49,315 --> 01:22:50,618
可能一百年了吧
A hundred years, probably.

1163
01:22:51,028 --> 01:22:52,142
我想他们一百年前
I don't think they had

1164
01:22:52,143 --> 01:22:54,249
不会有这样子的泳衣吧
bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.

1165
01:22:55,627 --> 01:22:57,422
我们现在都没有
We still don't have them now.

1166
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:01,971
好了 来吧
Well, come on.

1167
01:23:10,087 --> 01:23:12,315
你周六想去看道奇队的比赛吗
You wanna go see the Dodgers on Saturday?

1168
01:23:12,549 --> 01:23:14,066
- 当然了 - 那好
- Sure. - OK.

1169
01:23:14,246 --> 01:23:16,636
- 那你为我做件事吧 - 什么
- Will you do something for me? - What?

1170
01:23:16,916 --> 01:23:18,421
如果你笑了
If you laugh or you say

1171
01:23:18,446 --> 01:23:20,772
或者告诉家里别人这件事
anything about this to anybody in the family,

1172
01:23:20,797 --> 01:23:23,030
你周六 甚至这个季度 都别想去看
you don't get to go see the Dodgers on Saturday

1173
01:23:23,055 --> 01:23:24,493
道奇队的比赛了
or any other day of the season.

1174
01:23:24,721 --> 01:23:25,870
而且你会被打一顿
Also you get a beating.

1175
01:23:26,122 --> 01:23:28,414
那我还是不知道为好了
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.

1176
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:30,333
我真的很需要你的帮助 弗兰基
I really need your help, Frankie.

1177
01:23:30,679 --> 01:23:33,024
你知道 你是家里最有文化的了吧
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?

1178
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,117
- 知道 - 我想写信给艾丽斯
- Yeah. - I'm trying to write to Eilis.

1179
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:38,338
我想让信显得... 我不知道
And I want it to be... I don't know.

1180
01:23:38,517 --> 01:23:41,159
你之前都写过五次了
You've wrote before already about five times.

1181
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:43,638
是啊 但写得不好 弗兰基 而且...
Yeah, but they're no good, Frankie, and...

1182
01:23:46,323 --> 01:23:48,378
她只回了我一次
She's only written back once.

1183
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:51,037
她之前从来没读过我写的东西
She's never read my writing before.

1184
01:23:51,095 --> 01:23:53,241
我担心 我会让她厌烦
I'm worried I'm putting her off me.

1185
01:23:53,709 --> 01:23:55,807
听着 我才八岁
Listen, I'm eight years old.

1186
01:23:55,972 --> 01:23:57,630
我对接吻都一无所知
I don't know anything about kissing.

1187
01:23:57,655 --> 01:24:00,077
你不需要知道接吻啊
You don't need to know anything about kissing.

1188
01:24:00,426 --> 01:24:03,592
你只要知道拼写 还有...
You need to know about spelling and... and...

1189
01:24:03,617 --> 01:24:06,422
- 语法 - 对 你看看好吗
- Grammar. - Yeah. Will you look?

1190
01:24:15,391 --> 01:24:16,987
"亲爱的艾丽斯
"Dear Eilis.

1191
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:20,216
希望你在爱尔兰过得好
I hope that you are doing well in Ireland.

1192
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:23,344
希望你的母亲没那么悲伤了
I hope that your mother's feeling less sad.

1193
01:24:24,453 --> 01:24:27,587
距离你朋友结婚 然后你回来的日子
It will not be long before your friend gets married

1194
01:24:27,706 --> 01:24:29,684
已经不远了
and you can come home.

1195
01:24:32,536 --> 01:24:35,898
这周 好像全世界的地下室都淹水了一样
This week, it's like the whole world's basements are flooding.

1196
01:24:36,057 --> 01:24:37,692
我修了三家
I've fixed three.

1197
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:42,029
我一直在努力工作 在存钱
I've been working hard. I've been saving money.

1198
01:24:43,155 --> 01:24:45,616
大家一直都在问我关于你的事"
Everybody asks me about you all the time."

1199
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:47,451
我想你少写了一个"E"
You missed out an "E," I think.

1200
01:24:47,536 --> 01:24:49,808
是"大家"
It's "Everybody."

1201
01:24:51,777 --> 01:24:54,594
"总之 这就是我最近的事情了
"Anyway, I think that is all my news.

1202
01:24:54,684 --> 01:24:58,194
我父母和兄弟们向你问好
Mom and Dad and all my brothers, they all say hello.

1203
01:24:59,214 --> 01:25:02,383
我一天里大部分时间都在想你
I think about you most minutes of most days.

1204
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:06,220
甚至在我去看道奇队比赛时
Even when I go see the Dodgers,

1205
01:25:06,346 --> 01:25:08,889
我都无法将注意力集中在比赛上
I do not concentrate on the games.

1206
01:25:10,434 --> 01:25:12,727
爱你的 托尼"
With love, your Tony."

1207
01:26:11,113 --> 01:26:12,620
没抹发油啊
No hair oil.

1208
01:26:13,347 --> 01:26:15,664
也没穿西装 穿了运动夹克
And that's not a blazer. It's a sports jacket.

1209
01:26:15,791 --> 01:26:17,422
你是乔装出来的吗 吉姆·法雷尔
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?

1210
01:26:17,447 --> 01:26:18,987
你是想捉弄我吗
Are you trying to trick me?

1211
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:22,963
不 我只是理解了
No. I knew what you meant

1212
01:26:23,290 --> 01:26:25,013
你之前说我们没什么变化
when you said we were all the same.

1213
01:26:25,854 --> 01:26:28,612
你可能觉得 我的生活挺轻松的吧
It made me think that my life must seem very easy to you.

1214
01:26:28,773 --> 01:26:30,262
我经营着我父亲的酒吧
I run my father's bar.

1215
01:26:30,529 --> 01:26:32,584
又要住进我父母的房子里
I'm going to live in my parents' house.

1216
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:36,310
我知道 表面看起来是这样的 但是...
I know what that must look like from the outside, but...

1217
01:26:37,952 --> 01:26:39,385
感觉却不一样
It doesn't feel like that.

1218
01:26:40,932 --> 01:26:42,441
感觉什么样呢
What does it feel like?

1219
01:26:46,236 --> 01:26:47,875
我从来没去过别的地方
And I've never been anywhere.

1220
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:50,032
连英格兰都没去过
I've never even been to England

1221
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:51,546
但我很想出去看看
but I'd like to see London

1222
01:26:51,571 --> 01:26:54,757
伦敦 巴黎 罗马 还有纽约
and Paris and Rome. New York.

1223
01:26:55,463 --> 01:26:58,833
从没有出过爱尔兰就死去 想想都无法接受
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.

1224
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,293
当然还有些别的事
And there are other things too.

1225
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:05,582
很抱歉 我本来有很多事想问你
I'm so sorry, I wanted to ask you a thousand things

1226
01:27:05,607 --> 01:27:07,341
结果一直都是我在说
and all I've done is talked.

1227
01:27:07,647 --> 01:27:08,801
我很喜欢听
I'm glad.

1228
01:27:09,467 --> 01:27:11,561
- 真的吗 - 是啊
- Really? - Yes.

1229
01:27:14,059 --> 01:27:16,559
你能别抽了 跟我们坐下来聊聊吧
Will you finish that wretched pipe and sit with us?

1230
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,607
我在这也能很清楚地听到你们说话
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.

1231
01:27:18,632 --> 01:27:20,509
我们在这不是让你当猴子来看的
We're not here to provide you with entertainment.

1232
01:27:20,534 --> 01:27:21,647
别担心
Oh, don't you worry.

1233
01:27:21,731 --> 01:27:23,315
我很多年前就知道这回事了
I found that out many years ago.

1234
01:27:23,623 --> 01:27:24,942
别理他 艾丽斯
Just ignore him, Eilis.

1235
01:27:25,193 --> 01:27:27,248
吉姆像我 不像他
It's as well Jim takes after me, not him.

1236
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:28,368
声音大点
Speak up.

1237
01:27:28,975 --> 01:27:30,751
你们期待搬家吗
Are you looking forward to your move?

1238
01:27:30,939 --> 01:27:32,122
我们会想念恩尼斯科西的
We'll miss Enniscorthy,

1239
01:27:32,123 --> 01:27:33,784
但哥伦布恩也很不错 还很安静
but it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.

1240
01:27:33,966 --> 01:27:36,287
妈妈一直在担心留我一个人住在这
Mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.

1241
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,101
她觉得我会把这地方毁了的
She thinks I'll destroy the place.

1242
01:27:38,126 --> 01:27:39,957
我只是担心你永远都孤单一人
Well, I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.

1243
01:27:40,132 --> 01:27:41,375
他肯定不会的
I'm sure he won't.

1244
01:27:42,832 --> 01:27:44,137
我是说...
I mean...

1245
01:27:46,963 --> 01:27:48,418
天哪 天气难得这么好啊
God, aren't we blessed with this weather?

1246
01:27:48,849 --> 01:27:49,928
天气是很不错
It's lovely.

1247
01:27:51,357 --> 01:27:53,566
纽约的夏天很热吧
The summers in New York are hot, eh?

1248
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,556
是啊 很热
They can be, yes.

1249
01:27:55,682 --> 01:27:58,191
有时候还会非常潮湿
It can get quite humid sometimes.

1250
01:28:05,775 --> 01:28:07,277
"亲爱的托尼
"Dear Tony.

1251
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:10,138
谢谢你的来信
Thank you for your letters.

1252
01:28:10,969 --> 01:28:12,705
我想要你知道..."
I want you to know that..."

1253
01:28:16,536 --> 01:28:18,746
我不知道想要你知道什么
I don't know what I want you to know.

1254
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,886
我不想坐在后面
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.

1255
01:28:33,911 --> 01:28:36,162
我们会确保你坐在最好的位置上的
We'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.

1256
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:37,815
但跟南希和乔治坐在一起
But it wouldn't feel right

1257
01:28:37,816 --> 01:28:39,687
感觉也不太对
sitting up there with Nancy and George.

1258
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:42,770
那就给你安排在第二好的座位吧
We'll find the second best seats in the house, then.

1259
01:28:45,466 --> 01:28:46,604
你要我先走一步
Would you like me to run ahead

1260
01:28:46,605 --> 01:28:48,692
去给你占几个座吗 莱西夫人
and save you a couple of places, Mrs Lacey?

1261
01:28:48,777 --> 01:28:51,126
你介意吗 吉姆 那太好了
Would you mind, Jim? That'd be grand.

1262
01:28:54,616 --> 01:28:57,324
- 真是个绅士啊 是吗 - 是啊
- Such a gentleman, isn't he? - He is.

1263
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,978
我们在正确的时间遇见了他
Came along at just the right time for us.

1264
01:29:03,566 --> 01:29:05,543
我现在邀请你 南希
I invite you now, Nancy,

1265
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:08,587
在上帝和教堂前宣布
to declare before God and his Church

1266
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:12,171
你愿意成为乔治的妻子
your consent to become George's wife.

1267
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:19,139
我将对你忠诚 不论顺境或逆境
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad,

1268
01:29:19,389 --> 01:29:21,457
不论疾病或健康
in sickness and in health.

1269
01:29:21,947 --> 01:29:26,766
我会在我有生之年爱护你 尊重你
I will love you and honour you all the days of my life.

1270
01:29:28,151 --> 01:29:29,581
戒指
The rings.

1271
01:29:34,999 --> 01:29:37,242
主啊 保佑这对戒指
Lord, bless these rings.

1272
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:40,077
给予戴上它的人
Grant that those who wear them

1273
01:29:40,392 --> 01:29:43,318
永远忠诚于对方
may always be faithful to each other.

1274
01:29:43,814 --> 01:29:45,332
愿他们在您的意志下
May they do your will

1275
01:29:45,534 --> 01:29:48,804
和平相处 互相关爱
and live in peace with you in mutual love.

1276
01:29:49,274 --> 01:29:53,007
我们要求如此 我主基督 阿门
We ask this through Christ our Lord, amen.

1277
01:29:53,628 --> 01:29:54,842
阿门
Amen.

1278
01:30:03,518 --> 01:30:06,496
你母亲告诉我 你在恩尼斯科西
Your mother tells me things are working out very well

1279
01:30:06,521 --> 01:30:08,822
一切都很顺利 艾丽斯
for you in Enniscorthy, Eilis.

1280
01:30:09,633 --> 01:30:11,233
这真是个隆重的仪式
It was a lovely service.

1281
01:30:11,485 --> 01:30:15,029
法雷尔夫妇要搬去哥伦布恩了
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien,

1282
01:30:15,221 --> 01:30:18,112
- 所以吉姆就... - 是的 我知道
- so Jim'll... - Yes, I know.

1283
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:21,269
吉姆和我答应我母亲 要带她回车上的
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.

1284
01:30:21,294 --> 01:30:25,975
看你怎么说的 "吉姆和我 吉姆和我"
Mmm! Do you hear that? "Jim and I. Jim and I."

1285
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,042
听起来你俩的好事也不远了
It won't be long now by the sound of it

1286
01:30:28,168 --> 01:30:31,085
你母亲一定会很开心的
and your mother will have a wonderful day out.

1287
01:30:32,043 --> 01:30:33,140
先失陪了
Will you excuse me?

1288
01:30:33,633 --> 01:30:35,007
他们在这呢
There they are.

1289
01:30:35,658 --> 01:30:37,787
- 你好 伯恩夫人 还好吗 - 杰克
- Hello, Mrs Byrne. How are you? - Jack.

1290
01:30:43,693 --> 01:30:44,915
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk?

1291
01:30:47,046 --> 01:30:48,174
谈什么
What about?

1292
01:30:50,523 --> 01:30:51,832
未来
The future.

1293
01:30:52,994 --> 01:30:56,164
我不能让你什么都不说就回美国了
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.

1294
01:30:58,114 --> 01:31:00,341
这样我余生都会后悔的
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

1295
01:31:02,535 --> 01:31:03,702
所以
So...

1296
01:31:04,969 --> 01:31:06,580
我不想要你走
I don't want you to go.

1297
01:31:07,582 --> 01:31:10,763
我想要你留在这 跟我在一起
I want you to stay here with me.

1298
01:31:13,498 --> 01:31:16,632
我知道这意味着 另一个问题
And I know that means asking you another question

1299
01:31:18,218 --> 01:31:20,277
但我不想连珠炮似地质问你
but I don't want to bombard you.

1300
01:31:22,162 --> 01:31:24,328
所以我晚一点再问你吧
So I'll save that one for later.

1301
01:31:29,938 --> 01:31:31,271
谢谢
Thank you.

1302
01:31:34,943 --> 01:31:36,443
我很感激
I'm grateful.

1303
01:31:37,774 --> 01:31:39,374
也很受宠若惊
And I'm flattered.

1304
01:31:41,783 --> 01:31:43,784
- 就这些吗 - 不
- That's all? - No.

1305
01:31:45,245 --> 01:31:47,246
不 当然不是
No, of course not.

1306
01:31:53,188 --> 01:31:54,559
我只是...
I just...

1307
01:31:57,173 --> 01:32:00,008
我想象中 我会过上另一种完全不同的生活
I'd imagined a different life for myself.

1308
01:32:00,923 --> 01:32:02,469
我理解
I understand.

1309
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:06,140
但你在这生活 也能跟想象中一样好
But your life here could be just as good.

1310
01:32:07,362 --> 01:32:09,268
甚至可能更好
Better even maybe.

1311
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:51,852
玛丽
Mary.

1312
01:32:52,645 --> 01:32:55,260
- 我正准备去接你 - 接我干什么
- I was just coming to fetch you. - To fetch me?

1313
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,662
我已经很久不为凯丽小姐那工作了 玛丽
I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.

1314
01:32:57,687 --> 01:32:58,979
拜托来一趟吧 艾丽斯
Please come, Eilis.

1315
01:32:59,152 --> 01:33:00,834
她说找不到你 我就别回去了
She told me not to come back without you.

1316
01:33:01,049 --> 01:33:02,576
你知道她的脾气
You know what she's like.

1317
01:33:13,675 --> 01:33:15,081
我跟艾丽斯上楼的时候
You look after things for five

1318
01:33:15,106 --> 01:33:17,407
你替我照看五分钟的店 拜托了 玛丽
minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.

1319
01:33:17,576 --> 01:33:19,163
这个时候店里没有什么客人
There are no customers in there at the moment,

1320
01:33:19,188 --> 01:33:21,548
所以你应该不会搞得一团糟
so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.

1321
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:46,194
最近怎么样啊
So, how have you been getting on?

1322
01:33:47,741 --> 01:33:49,076
非常好 谢谢 凯丽小姐
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.

1323
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:51,703
我听说你在戴维斯那边的
I heard that you're working over in Davis's,

1324
01:33:51,788 --> 01:33:53,789
财务部工作
in the accounts department.

1325
01:33:54,024 --> 01:33:55,123
是的
That's right.

1326
01:33:55,318 --> 01:33:56,552
我也听到了很多
And there's lots of talk

1327
01:33:56,553 --> 01:33:58,669
关于你和吉姆·法雷尔的传言
about you and young Jim Farrell.

1328
01:33:58,753 --> 01:34:02,459
你知道的 大家就喜欢说些流言蜚语的
Oh, well, you know what people are like. They love to talk.

1329
01:34:02,484 --> 01:34:03,480
是啊
Yes.

1330
01:34:05,253 --> 01:34:07,719
你还记得布雷迪夫人吗
Do you remember Mrs Brady?

1331
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:10,850
她经常在周日早上
She usually comes into

1332
01:34:10,851 --> 01:34:13,576
来店里买熏肉薄片
the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.

1333
01:34:15,728 --> 01:34:16,810
不记得了吗
No?

1334
01:34:17,889 --> 01:34:20,399
那你现在过得很忙啊
Well, you have a very busy life now,

1335
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,276
事情一件接一件的
what with one thing and another.

1336
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:28,929
总之 布雷迪夫人有个侄女 住在布鲁克林
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.

1337
01:34:32,412 --> 01:34:35,122
世界真小啊 是吗
The world is a small place, isn't it?

1338
01:34:35,877 --> 01:34:38,913
她几周前收到了一封侄女的来信
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.

1339
01:34:41,128 --> 01:34:42,519
上面写了什么
And what did it say?

1340
01:34:42,964 --> 01:34:46,728
只说了她去市政厅参加
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding

1341
01:34:46,753 --> 01:34:47,968
一场婚礼
city hall

1342
01:34:48,573 --> 01:34:49,692
她丈夫无意中
and her husband bumped into

1343
01:34:49,693 --> 01:34:52,548
碰到一个来自恩尼斯科西的女孩
a girl from Enniscorthy

1344
01:34:52,773 --> 01:34:54,937
也在那登记结婚
who was getting married there.

1345
01:34:57,879 --> 01:34:59,938
我不太明白你想说什么 凯丽小姐
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.

1346
01:35:00,023 --> 01:35:01,548
他没有碰见我
He didn't bump into me.

1347
01:35:01,717 --> 01:35:04,985
你可骗不了我 莱西小姐
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.

1348
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,880
虽然我都不确定 你的名字有没有换
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?

1349
01:35:11,423 --> 01:35:13,160
他不太记得了
He couldn't remember.

1350
01:35:14,306 --> 01:35:16,444
好像是意大利的姓吧
Something Italian, he thought.

1351
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:24,838
我都忘了
I'd forgotten.

1352
01:35:24,923 --> 01:35:28,091
你都忘了 这简直...
You'd forgotten? What a thing...

1353
01:35:28,176 --> 01:35:30,677
我都忘了这个镇是什么样的了
I'd forgotten what this town is like.

1354
01:35:35,257 --> 01:35:37,643
凯丽小姐 你这么说有什么目的吗
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?

1355
01:35:39,103 --> 01:35:41,065
让我离吉姆远点吗
Keep me away from Jim?

1356
01:35:42,482 --> 01:35:45,025
还是想阻止我回美国
Stop me from going back to America?

1357
01:35:47,528 --> 01:35:49,613
或许连你自己都不知道
Perhaps you didn't even know.

1358
01:35:56,788 --> 01:36:00,457
我的名字是艾丽斯·费欧雷洛
My name is Eilis Fiorello.

1359
01:36:33,408 --> 01:36:35,826
- 现在就给你接过去 - 谢谢
- Putting you through now. - Thank you.

1360
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,327
能帮你点什么吗
How can I help?

1361
01:36:37,633 --> 01:36:39,246
你好 我想预定一张
Hello. I'd like to make a reservation

1362
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:42,499
从科夫去纽约的船票 越快越好
for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.

1363
01:36:43,002 --> 01:36:45,836
我觉得人们婚礼后 反而花的钱更多了
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.

1364
01:36:46,034 --> 01:36:48,421
南希的母亲应该去遍了镇上所有的商店吧
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.

1365
01:36:48,446 --> 01:36:50,247
她都在布鲁姆店买好点火器了
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.

1366
01:36:50,421 --> 01:36:52,009
八月就买好了点火器
Firelighters in August.

1367
01:36:52,469 --> 01:36:54,594
她在那见到了斯泰普尔顿夫人 但还没来得及
But she'd seen Mrs Stapleton in there and she hadn't had a chance

1368
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:57,347
跟她把婚礼的细节过一遍
to go through the whole day in detail with her...

1369
01:36:59,403 --> 01:37:00,726
艾丽斯 怎么了
Eilis, what's the matter?

1370
01:37:01,209 --> 01:37:02,674
你跟吉姆间出什么事了吗
Has something happened with Jim?

1371
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:06,359
妈妈 对不起
Mammy, I'm sorry.

1372
01:37:07,499 --> 01:37:08,942
真的对不起
I'm so sorry.

1373
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:11,943
我已经结婚了
I'm married.

1374
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,625
我回家前就在布鲁克林结婚了
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home.

1375
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,701
我应该告诉你的
And I should have told you.

1376
01:37:17,785 --> 01:37:20,579
我应该一回来就告诉你的
I should have told you as soon as I got back.

1377
01:37:25,378 --> 01:37:27,252
我想跟他在一起
I want to be with him.

1378
01:37:29,186 --> 01:37:31,050
我想跟我的丈夫在一起
I want to be with my husband.

1379
01:37:33,929 --> 01:37:35,260
当然了
Of course.

1380
01:37:38,382 --> 01:37:39,489
他人好吗
Is he nice?

1381
01:37:41,559 --> 01:37:42,642
很好
Yes.

1382
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:45,169
你嫁的人一定很好
He'd have to be nice if you married him.

1383
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:49,790
你要回去吗
So you're going back?

1384
01:37:51,319 --> 01:37:54,769
对 明天走
Yes. Tomorrow.

1385
01:37:58,299 --> 01:38:00,206
你要赶早班车吗
Are you on the early train?

1386
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:07,015
我要去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

1387
01:38:07,752 --> 01:38:11,088
妈妈 现在连八点都不到 别这样
Mammy, it's not even 8:00. You don't have to.

1388
01:38:11,172 --> 01:38:12,644
我很累了
I'm very tired.

1389
01:38:14,141 --> 01:38:16,624
我想现在就说再见
And I'd like to say goodbye now.

1390
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:20,597
就说这一次
And only once.

1391
01:38:54,382 --> 01:38:56,605
你以后可以在信里写写他的事
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.

1392
01:38:57,174 --> 01:38:58,135
我会的
I will.

1393
01:38:59,649 --> 01:39:01,221
晚安 艾丽斯
Good night, Eilis.

1394
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:19,634
你是要去美国生活吗
So are you away to live in America?

1395
01:41:21,169 --> 01:41:23,655
- 不 - 只是去看看吗
- No. - Just visiting?

1396
01:41:24,824 --> 01:41:26,862
不 我已经住在那了
No, I live there already.

1397
01:41:27,326 --> 01:41:29,861
真的吗 那里是什么样的
Really? What's it like?

1398
01:41:31,175 --> 01:41:33,076
那是一个很大的地方
It's a big place.

1399
01:41:35,232 --> 01:41:37,335
我要住在纽约的布鲁克林
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York.

1400
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:39,599
你知道那吗
Do you know it?

1401
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:42,549
知道
Yes.

1402
01:41:44,148 --> 01:41:47,085
人们说那里有很多爱尔兰人
People say that there are so many Irish people there,

1403
01:41:47,873 --> 01:41:49,314
就像家一样
it's like home.

1404
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:53,962
是真的吗
Is that right?

1405
01:41:58,824 --> 01:41:59,899
是的
Yes.

1406
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:02,527
就像家一样
It's just like home.

1407
01:42:15,502 --> 01:42:16,979
你什么都别吃
You're not to eat.

1408
01:42:17,933 --> 01:42:19,749
但我要在那待很多年啊
But I might be there years.

1409
01:42:20,183 --> 01:42:21,970
不是 你到那之后随便吃
No, you can eat when you get there.

1410
01:42:21,995 --> 01:42:23,267
但别在船上吃东西
Don't eat on the boat.

1411
01:42:23,468 --> 01:42:25,984
这样你就不会晕船了 答应我好吗
It'll stop you getting so sick. Do you promise me?

1412
01:42:26,827 --> 01:42:27,677
我答应
I promise.

1413
01:42:27,762 --> 01:42:30,411
一会你就直接去你的房间
And in a moment I want you to go straight down to your cabin

1414
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:32,406
从你这边把厕所门锁上
and lock the bathroom door on your side.

1415
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:35,669
等隔壁开始锤门 你就跟他们协商
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.

1416
01:42:37,583 --> 01:42:40,273
等你到了移民局检查站 睁大眼睛
When you get to immigration, keep your eyes wide open.

1417
01:42:40,608 --> 01:42:42,359
一定要让自己看起来目标明确
Look as if you know where you're going.

1418
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:44,653
一定要像美国人一样思考
You have to think like an American.

1419
01:42:47,091 --> 01:42:50,168
你会特别的想家 想得要死
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die

1420
01:42:50,642 --> 01:42:53,811
但除了忍耐以外 没有别的办法
and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.

1421
01:42:55,498 --> 01:42:58,375
但你会做到的 这一切不会击垮你
But you will, and it won't kill you.

1422
01:43:13,057 --> 01:43:16,052
终有一天 太阳会升起
And one day the sun will come out.

1423
01:43:16,517 --> 01:43:18,311
但你可能都注意不到
You might not even notice straightaway,

1424
01:43:18,537 --> 01:43:20,371
因为它是那么的微弱
it'll be that faint.

1425
01:43:20,815 --> 01:43:21,852
之后你会开始
And then you'll catch

1426
01:43:21,877 --> 01:43:25,137
在意一些与过去无关的
yourself thinking about something or someone

1427
01:43:25,162 --> 01:43:27,679
人和事
who has no connection with the past,

1428
01:43:29,338 --> 01:43:31,563
在意一个只属于你的人
someone who's only yours,

1429
01:43:32,814 --> 01:43:34,522
那时你就会明白
and you'll realise...

1430
01:43:37,012 --> 01:43:39,345
此心安处是吾乡
that this is where your life is.
