1
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,746
I'm talkin'about friendship.

2
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,481
I'm talkin'about character.

3
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:33,993
I'm talkin'about-- Hell, Leo,
I ain't embarrassed to use the word.

4
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:37,224
I'm talkin' about ethics.

5
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,357
You know I'm a sportin' man.

6
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:41,868
I like to lay the occasional bet.

7
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:44,497
But I ain't that sportin'.

8
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:47,474
When I fix a fight--
Say I pay a three to one favorite...

9
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:49,569
to throw a goddamned fight.

10
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:53,777
I figure I got the right to expect that fight
to go off at three to one.

11
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,582
But every time I lay in bed
with this son of a bitch Bernie Bernbaum,

12
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:00,955
before I know it, the odds is even up.

13
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,587
Or worse, I'm bettin' on the short money.

14
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,927
The sheeny knows I like sure things.

15
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,458
He's sellin' the information I fixed the fight.

16
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,902
Out of town money comes pouring in.

17
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,203
The odds go straight to hell.

18
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:17,643
I don't know who he's sellin' to--
maybe the Los Angeles combine.

19
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,647
I don't know. The point is,

20
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:23,879
Bernie ain't satisfied with the honest dollar
he can make off the vig.

21
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:27,185
He ain't satisfied
with the business I do on his book.

22
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:30,159
He is sellin' tips on how I bet.

23
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:33,391
And that means part of the payoff
 that should be riding on my hip...

24
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:35,626
is riding on someone else's.

25
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:38,226
So, back we go to these questions--

26
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,173
friendship, character,

27
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:44,574
ethics.

28
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:49,774
So, it's clear what I'm saying?

29
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:54,086
As mud.

30
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,394
It's gettin' so a businessman
can't expect no return from a fixed fight.

31
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,925
Now, if you can't trust a fix, what can you trust?

32
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,405
For a good return,you gotta go bettin'on chance,

33
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,705
and then you're back with anarchy.

34
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:13,711
Right back in the jungle.

35
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:18,843
That's why ethics is important--
what separates us from the animals,

36
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,388
the beasts of burden, the beasts of prey.

37
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,424
Ethics.

38
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,690
Whereas, uh, Bernie Bernbaum
is a horse of a different color,

39
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:31,494
ethics-wise, as in he ain't got any.

40
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,664
- You sure it's Bernie selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

41
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,608
- No one else knows about the fix?
 - No one that ain't got ethics.

42
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:42,704
What about the fighters you pay to tank out?

43
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:46,717
We only pick fighters we know
 we can put the fear of God in.

44
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:49,084
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

45
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:52,387
I-I lay an occasional bet with Mink Larouie.

46
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,984
- But it ain't Mink. I'll vouch for that.
 -How do you know?

47
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:58,328
It ain't Mink. Mink is Eddie Dane's boy.

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,234
Of course the Dane always knows about the fix.

49
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:04,431
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?

50
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:08,035
Let it drift.
 All it means is a lot of people know.

51
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,477
I guess you ain't been listenin'.

52
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:12,742
Sure, other people know.

53
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:15,513
That's why we gotta go
 to this question of character...

54
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:19,284
to determine just who, exactly,
 is chiselin' in on my fix.

55
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:23,124
And that's how we know
that it's Bernie Bernbaum, the shmatte kid--

56
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:26,290
'cause ethically, he's kinda shaky.

57
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:31,596
- So you want to kill him.
- For starters.

58
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:50,552
Sorry, Caspar. Bernie pays for protection.

59
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:55,261
Listen, Leo,
I ain't askin' you for permission.

60
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:59,498
I'm tellin' you as a courtesy. I need
to do this thing, so it's gonna get done.

61
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,507
And I'm tellin' you, as a courtesy,
you'll have trouble.

62
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,444
You came here to see if I'd kick if you
killed Bernie. Well, there's your answer.

63
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:09,176
I pay off to you every month
 like a greengrocer

64
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,242
a lot more than the shmatte,

65
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,254
and I'm sick of gettin' the high hat.

66
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:16,349
You pay off for protection
just like everyone else.

67
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:19,224
As far as I know, and what I don't know
 in this town ain't worth knowing,

68
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:21,287
the cops haven't closed any of your dives...

69
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,856
and the D.A. hasn't touched any of your rackets.

70
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:26,460
You haven't bought any license to kill bookies,

71
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,529
and today I ain't sellin'any.

72
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,509
So take your flunky and dangle.

73
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:35,981
You think I'm some guinea fresh off the boat,
 and you can kick me.

74
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:40,110
But I'm too big for that now.
I'm sick of takin' the strap from you, Leo.

75
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:42,554
I'm sick of marching into this goddamn office...

76
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:44,649
to kiss your Irish ass,

77
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:07,149
You's fancy pants, all of youse.

78
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,490
Johnny?

79
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:14,892
You're exactly as big
 as I let you be and no bigger,

80
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:17,260
and don't forget it, ever.

81
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,768
That's right, Leo.

82
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,930
You're the big shot around here,

83
00:05:24,006 --> 00:05:27,669
and I'm just some schnook
likes to get slapped around.

84
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:38,022
Twist a pig's ear, watch him squeal.

85
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,262
- Bad play, Leo.
- Who got up the wrong side, huh?

86
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:53,171
-Same side as always.
- That's what I mean. Still owe money to--

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,699
Who is your bookie, Lazarre?
I could put it right for you.

88
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,805
- Thanks, Leo. I don't need it.
- In a pig's eye.

89
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,816
You haven't played a winner in six weeks.

90
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:04,285
People will speak ill of me
if I let him break your legs.

91
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:08,223
- People will say I had it coming.
-And they'll be right, but that ain't the point.

92
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:12,161
Call me a bighearted slob,
but I'm gonna square it for you, yeah.

93
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,689
I think I'll do that this very same night.

94
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:19,636
Lookin' at you mopin' around
takes away all my--

95
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:23,420
- What do you call it? ''Joy de veever''?
-Joie de vivre.

96
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,471
 Well, if you're gonna laugh at me,
 the hell with ya.

97
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:28,174
The hell with you.

98
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:30,650
I'll square myself with Lazarre,
 if you don't mind.

99
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,620
That's why God invented cards.

100
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:38,959
- There is one thing you can do for me.
- Name it.

101
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,521
Think about what protecting Bernie gets us.

102
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,193
Think about what offending Caspar loses us.

103
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:46,635
Oh, come on, Tommy.
You know I don't like to think.

104
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,764
Yeah.

105
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,812
Well, think about whether you should start.

106
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,534
Wake up, Tommy.

107
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,734
- I am awake.
- Your eyes are shut.

108
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,074
Who you gonna believe?

109
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,253
- How'd I do?
- What do you think?

110
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:01,162
You are a millionaire.
You gonna remember your friends?

111
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:08,165
- Where's me hat?
- You bet it, mug.

112
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:11,767
Good thing the game broke up
before you bet your trousers.

113
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:16,245
- Who made off with me hat?

114
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:19,114
Verna. Verna and Mink.

115
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,587
- Who?
- Mink and Verna.

116
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:31,698
Is Thunderclap running tonight?

117
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:34,999
Thunderclap?
Yeah.

118
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:37,097
What's she leaving at?

119
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:39,836
Three to one, more than likely.

120
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,142
Lay off, Tom.
You shouldn't go deeper in the hole.

121
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,740
Tell Lazarre...

122
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:49,276
I want 500 on the nose.

123
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,915
You would have it.

124
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:07,503
I want me hat.

125
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:11,377
Is that all you came for?

126
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:13,781
Yeah. I want me hat.

127
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,012
It's mine. I won it.

128
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:18,852
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Drop dead.

129
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,202
I need a drink.

130
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,899
Why didn't you say so?

131
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:32,469
Hello, Tommy.
Sorry about the hour.

132
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:36,380
- I'll live. What's the rumpus?
-Can I come in?

133
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:41,478
Sure.

134
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,330
- Drink?
- I wouldn't mind.

135
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:02,306
I tried callin' earlier.

136
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,009
I got home late.

137
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:15,594
- Well, uh, I'm sorry about the hour.
- Uh-huh.

138
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,540
- Not bad.
- Better than the paint we sell at the club.

139
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,244
That it is. That it is.

140
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,020
- You thought about cutting Bernie loose?
 - Can't do it, Tommy.

141
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,084
Can't do it.

142
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,688
That's sort of why I'm, uh--

143
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,328
Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.

144
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:54,705
- Uh-huh.
 - I know what you're thinkin', what else is new?

145
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:57,768
But the situation now--
I'm worried.

146
00:12:57,846 --> 00:13:01,283
Verna can take care of herself,
 maybe better than you can.

147
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:04,947
- What does that mean?
- Want another one?

148
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,956
No.

149
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,083
What does that mean?

150
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,560
How far she got
her hooks into you?

151
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,723
That's a hell of a question.

152
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:18,132
It's a grift.

153
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:21,868
If she didn't need you to protect
her brother from Johnny Caspar,

154
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:25,606
you think she'd still be going on slow
 carriage rides with you through the park?

155
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,084
That's the deal, isn't it? You keep Bernie
 under wraps till Caspar cools down?

156
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:34,020
Jesus, you're a prickly pear. What's wrong
with her wanting her brother taken care of?

157
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,024
Nothing. I don't blame her.

158
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:38,424
She sees the angle,
which is you, she plays it.

159
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:41,465
She's a grifter, just like her brother.

160
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,796
Probably had grifter parents
and grifter grandparents...

161
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,963
and someday they're each
 gonna spawn little grifter kids.

162
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,270
Stop it, Tommy. I don't like to hear
 my friends run down, even by other friends.

163
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:52,538
- Friendship's got nothing to do with it.
- The hell you say.

164
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:55,376
You'd do anything to help your friends,
 like you'd do anything to kick your enemies.

165
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,019
- Wrong, Leo. You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

166
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,953
- Wrong, Leo. You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

167
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:02,219
You know all the angles,
Christ, better than anybody.

168
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,391
But maybe you're wrong about this.
You don't know what's in Verna's heart.

169
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:10,331
Leo, if she's such an angel,

170
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,666
why are you looking for her
at 4:00 in the morning?

171
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:19,010
I put a tail on her this afternoon.

172
00:14:20,446 --> 00:14:25,077
- Uh-huh.
- I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around,

173
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:28,350
just, you know, to keep her out of trouble.

174
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:32,554
I was worried. After that meeting
with Caspar, you can't be too careful.

175
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:35,057
So what did Rug say
that has you scurrying over here?

176
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:41,665
 That's just it. Nothing.
He's disappeared.

177
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,112
So you lost your lady friend
and the tail you put on her?

178
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,333
I guess it does sound pretty sorry at that.

179
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:47,867
Help me out, Tom.
I wouldn't know where to start lookin'.

180
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:50,506
You know Rug's crowd.
 You know the people Verna runs with.

181
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:54,212
It's just I'm worried now with things
the way they are between me and Caspar.

182
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,120
You shouldn't be confronting Johnny Caspar.
 That's what I've been trying to tell you.

183
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,024
You can't trade body blows with him.
He's gotten too strong.

184
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:04,122
I reckon I can still trade body blows
 with any man in this town.

185
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,967
Except you, Tom.

186
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,974
And Verna.

187
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,549
Okay. Give me the needle.

188
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,555
I am a sap.

189
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,963
I deserve it.

190
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,127
Thanks for the drink.

191
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,938
Let me know if you hear anything.

192
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:12,070
- Who was that?
- Leo.

193
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:14,376
He's lookin' for you.

194
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:16,917
Did you tell him I was here?

195
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,476
No.

196
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:25,326
Did you put in a good word for my brother?

197
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:27,489
No.

198
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:30,796
- You said you would.
- I said I'd think about it.

199
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,065
What did you tell him?

200
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,943
Did you see Rug Daniels last night?

201
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,380
No.

202
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,543
What did you tell Leo?

203
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:48,282
I told him you were a tramp
and he should dump you.

204
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:55,061
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

205
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,379
- Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?
- Mink.

206
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,547
- I see you got your hat back.
- Yeah, what of it?

207
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:14,716
Not a thing. Look, if it ain't my business,
I got not a thing to say.

208
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,727
Listen, Bernie wants to see you.
It's important.

209
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,729
Yeah, well, I'm right here.
I'm not made of glass.

210
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,460
He's nervous walkin' around in public.
He's a right guy, but he's very nervous.

211
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,128
I mean, who wouldn't be?
In the spot he's in, who wouldn't be?

212
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,536
He asked me to ask you
to ask Leo to take care of him.

213
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,631
Leo listens to you. Not that Leo
wouldn't help a shmatte anyway.

214
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,042
A guy like Bernie?
A straight shooter like him?

215
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,014
- I don't get it, Mink.

216
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,847
- What's to get?
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

217
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,314
- I tell you were Eddie Dane's sycophant.
- Yeah, Tom, that's right,

218
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:37,820
but a guy can have more
than one friend, can't he?

219
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,109
Not that I want the Dane to know about it,
but the shmatte, he's a right guy, Tommy.

220
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:44,189
He's got a mixed reputation, but for a sheeny,
  he's got a lot of good qualities.

221
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,526
- What's goin' on between you and Bernie?
- Nothin', Tom.

222
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:49,623
We're just...
friends, you know, amigos.

223
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,675
You're a fickle boy, Mink.

224
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:56,437
If Eddie Dane finds out
that you got another ''amigo''--

225
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:58,735
- Well, I don't peg him
for the understanding type.

226
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:01,598
 Find out? How's he gonna find out?
Damn, Tommy!

227
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:04,739
You and me haven't even been talking!
Jesus, Tommy! Goddamn it, Jesus!

228
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:10,247
Hello, Tommy.

229
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:13,523
- You know O'Doole and the mayor?
-I oughta.

230
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:16,258
Voted for him six times last May.

231
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:18,392
And that ain't the record, either.

232
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,601
Oh, Verna turned up. She's downstairs.

233
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:28,009
- She say where she'd been?
 - No. I didn't want to press her.

234
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,449
- You hear about Rug?
- Yeah. R.I.P.

235
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:35,511
They took his hair, Tommy.

236
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:38,285
Jesus, that's strange.
Why would they do that?

237
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:42,853
- Maybe it was injuns.
- ''Eye-ties,'' more like it.

238
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,967
Giovanni Gasparo.

239
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:49,903
So you figure Caspar bumped Rug.

240
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,600
- Well, it's pretty obvious, ain't it?
- Yeah?

241
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,342
- So what's the plan?

242
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:57,400
 - Well, we'll jump on the guinea hard
 with both feet.

243
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:01,241
- Give him the lowdown, Dale.
- Yes. Well, um,

244
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:04,049
Leo here just reminded us
 that Mr. Caspar operates...

245
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:06,148
several clubs in our city,

246
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:10,219
wherein the patrons imbibe of rum
and play at games of chance.

247
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:12,458
And we're supposed to stop the party.

248
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:15,593
- They don't look to happy about it, Leo.
 - Oh, no, it ain't that, Tom.

249
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,730
-Jesus, Tom, we do as we're told.
- Maybe they're right not to like it.

250
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,935
Stirring up this hornet's nest won't be good
for anyone, and it'll mean killing.

251
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,105
I'm not thrilled about it either,
 but I can't just lay down to Caspar.

252
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:27,741
You could do worse. You might not like it,
but giving up Bernie Bernbaum...

253
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,785
is a pretty small price to pay for peace.

254
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,948
Business is business,
and a war is going to hurt everybody.

255
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,356
Bernie plays with fire, he's got
 to deal with the consequences.

256
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:37,418
even if that means he gets bumped off.

257
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:41,490
SweetJesus, Tom, that ain't even
the point anymore. Caspar pooped Rug.

258
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,400
The day I back down from a fight,
Caspar's welcome to the rackets,

259
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,530
this town and my place at the table.

260
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,700
- I didn't start this thing, but--
- You did start it.

261
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:52,268
- You and Verna.
- We can dangle, Leo, if you'd prefer.

262
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:57,908
And Caspar hasn't broken the rules,
 Bernie has, and you, too, by helping him.

263
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:00,148
And if that isn't enough,
 consider that if you make this a war,

264
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:02,384
you have more to lose than Caspar.

265
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:06,556
Okay, but more to beat him with. Jesus, Tom,
the two of us have faced worse odds.

266
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:10,168
Never without reason.
It helps to have one.

267
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,577
Well, it's your call.

268
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,512
My opinion used to count for something
around here.

269
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,710
But it's always yours to take or leave.

270
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,719
Come on, Tommy. It's not like that.

271
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:36,327
Goddamn kid's just like a twist.

272
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:38,891
Get me a stiff one.

273
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:42,602
No small talk, huh?

274
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:48,108
- They shoot your horse?
- If there's any justice.

275
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:52,039
- Verna around?
 - She stepped into the ladies' room.

276
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:55,383
- You got Lazarre's 500?
- You'll have to carry me for a few days.

277
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:58,516
He ain't gonna like that.
Couldn't you get it from Leo?

278
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:01,892
It's not Leo's debt.
I'll pay me own way.

279
00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:03,864
I admire a man of principle.

280
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:08,604
Does this go on the tab?

281
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:11,367
- Close your eyes, ladies.
I'm coming through.

282
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:19,241
- Who's the war paint for?
- Go home and dry out.

283
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,443
You don't need it for Leo, believe me.

284
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,989
He already thinks you're
the original Miss Jesus.

285
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,184
- What the hell's the matter with you?
 - What's the matter with you?

286
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,822
- Afraid people might get the right idea?
 - Leo's got the right idea.

287
00:22:30,897 --> 00:22:33,559
I like him.
He's honest and he's got a heart.

288
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:35,899
Then it's true what they say--
opposites attract.

289
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,462
- Do me a favor. Mind your own business.
- This is my business.

290
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,408
Intimidating helpless women
is part of what I do.

291
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:44,639
- Then find one and intimidate her.
-Leo's upstairs...

292
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:47,080
getting ready to shoot himself
in the foot on your account.

293
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,084
-I don't know what you're talkin'about.
- He's gonna go to the mat...

294
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:51,087
for your brother, and it's gonna hurt him.

295
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:53,350
I don't know Leo's business,
but he's a big boy.

296
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:55,450
- He used to be.
- Look, what do you want, Tom?

297
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:58,360
You want me to pretend
 I don't care what happens to Bernie?

298
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,161
Well, I do. He's my brother.
I don't want to see him get hurt.

299
00:23:01,234 --> 00:23:05,672
If Leo wants to help out, I'll step out
with him, show him a good time in return.

300
00:23:05,739 --> 00:23:06,968
- There's no harm in that.

301
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:09,308
 - There's a name
 for that kind of business arrangement.

302
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:12,704
Look, I'll do what I have to do to protect Bernie.

303
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:15,113
There's no reason for you to try and queer that.

304
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,812
Regardless of what you think about me,
Bernie's a decent guy.

305
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:21,551
- A straight shooter, huh? A square ''G.''
- Yeah.

306
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,891
Sneer at him like everyone else,
just because he's different.

307
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:28,625
People think he's a degenerate.
People think he's scum.

308
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,296
- Well, he's not.
-Poor misunderstood Bernie.

309
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,805
What is this about, Tom?

310
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:38,310
You want me to stop seeing Leo?
Why don't you just say so?

311
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:43,583
I want you to quit spinning Leo in circles
 and pointing him where to go.

312
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:46,119
- I forgot. That's your job.
 - I'll do what I have to do to protect Leo.

313
00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:49,589
I'm asking you politely. Leave him alone.
I don't have to ask.

314
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:52,856
If I told him about our little dance last night,
your pool would pretty soon dry up.

315
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:54,988
So would yours.
I don't like being threatened.

316
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:59,263
I don't like being taken for a sucker. That
might work with Leo, but it don't work with me.

317
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:02,533
Do you think last night was just
 more campaigning for my brother?

318
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:04,507
I can see the angles.

319
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,669
You know, if there was a market
 for little old ladies,

320
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,737
you'd have Grandma Bernbaum first in line.

321
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,544
- You're a pathetic rumhead.
- And I love you, angel.

322
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:31,063
I suppose you think you raised hell.

323
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:38,707
Sister, when I've raised hell, you'll know it.

324
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:21,489
- I need a couple of days.
- Yeah? How come is that?

325
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:25,801
- Because I don't have it.
 - All right, how do I know you ain't got it?

326
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:29,934
- Because I say so.
- That ain't gonna be good enough.

327
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,606
- What would be good enough?
- Lazarre ain't gonna like it one bit.

328
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:36,618
Tell Lazarre if he's not happy, he can send
someone over to break my legs.

329
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:39,678
I won't squawk.

330
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:44,021
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hello, Tom.

331
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:47,724
- What's the rumpus?
-Come on in. Make yourself at home.

332
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,359
Yeah, you weren't here,
so I thought I'd do that.

333
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:52,734
I didn't want to answer the phone,
 though. I figured...

334
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,739
it wasn't for me.

335
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,341
I get it. Get to the point, huh?

336
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:02,246
Okay. The point is, I'm a good guy.

337
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:04,250
I've heard that from a lot of people today.

338
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:06,218
Good guy, lots of friends.
That's the way it works.

339
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:10,952
Maybe if you appreciated me a little more,
 you wouldn't be making waves with Leo.

340
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:13,825
It's a bad time to be doing that.
Right now, we're both in a jam.

341
00:26:13,897 --> 00:26:17,561
I hear you're on a bad streak.
Short of funds.

342
00:26:17,635 --> 00:26:20,934
Well, I got that crazy dago mad at me.

343
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,974
Don't ask me why. I'm just a small-timer...

344
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,339
trying to get by like everyone else.

345
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,403
I need help from my friends like Leo and you.

346
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:30,574
Leo gets your sister.
What are you sellin' me?

347
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,051
Come on, Tom. It's not like that at all.
It wasn't my idea.

348
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,213
She'll sleep with anyone.
You know that.

349
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:38,953
She even tried to teach me
a thing or two about bed artistry.

350
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:41,860
Can you believe that?

351
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,195
My own sister.

352
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:49,398
Some crackpot idea
 about saving me from my friends.

353
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,633
She's a sick twist, all right.

354
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:55,509
- She speaks highly of you.
- Yeah, well, you stick by your family.

355
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,140
The point is, I can help you with your debts
if that would make us friends.

356
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:01,617
My motto is, ''A guy can't have too many.''

357
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:04,919
Big payday Saturday, Tom.
You could be in on it.

358
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:07,289
Another fix? Which fight?

359
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,422
That's confidential at the moment.
But it doesn't have to stay that way.

360
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:13,796
How come you know so much about it?

361
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,995
Caspar isn't laying any more bets with you.

362
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,910
You really must have Mink
jumping through hoops.

363
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,314
Like I say, you can't have too many.

364
00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:35,617
- We got a deal?
- I'll think about it.

365
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:40,430
I wouldn't want it any other way.

366
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,931
Hey, Adolph.

367
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,845
- My credit still good with you? - Mmm.

368
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,608
Give me a hundred across
on Tailor Made in the third tonight.

369
00:27:53,682 --> 00:27:57,016
- Lazarre won't like it.
- Try 50 across.

370
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,520
I'll try.
It's another 150 you'll owe him.

371
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:03,048
- Only if I lose, Adolph.
- Tommy, the way you're goin'--

372
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:06,689
- Hey, horses got knees?
- I don't know. Fetlocks.

373
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:10,724
Well, if I was a horse, I'd be down on my
fetlocks praying you don't bet on me.

374
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,169
- Drift, small guy.
- Drop dead, ape.

375
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,537
Come on, Tom. Boss wants to see ya.

376
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:18,009
He didn't have time to engrave nothin' formal.

377
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,661
What you mean, he's eatin' too much?
What's the goddamn doctor know?

378
00:28:43,774 --> 00:28:46,538
- What you eat for lunch?
- A hot dog.

379
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,274
-Just a hot dog?
- A hot dog and mustard.

380
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:54,911
A hot dog and mustard.

381
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:03,988
You hear that, Dane?
My kid is as smart as a whip.

382
00:29:04,064 --> 00:29:06,828
Even Uncle Eddie thinks that's funny.

383
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:09,803
Okay.

384
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:14,500
Go ahead. Which hand is the penny in?

385
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:18,372
Choose again.

386
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,584
Okay. Here you go.
 Take the penny. Shiny new penny.

387
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,233
- I ain't got a penny, boss.
- That's a penny you owe him.

388
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:38,829
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?
You like kids?

389
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:42,171
- No.
- Have a seat. Go ahead.

390
00:29:43,678 --> 00:29:45,613
Well, you're missin' out on a complete life.

391
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:48,172
I know, kids, big deal.

392
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,186
Still, I'm telling you.

393
00:29:51,254 --> 00:29:54,815
Anyways, thanks for comin' by.

394
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,921
I just wrote this check out
to your bookmaker Lazarre.

395
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:01,795
It's for an even 1,500,
which is more than I hear you owe him,

396
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:05,200
but I figured you could always use some money
 on the cuff, a high roller such as yourself.

397
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,365
- What do you say?
- Thanks.

398
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:12,810
Always the yapper, huh?

399
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,250
Well, you're welcome. You wanna know
 why I'm puttin' you square with Lazarre?

400
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:20,651
- Not particularly.
- I want everybody to be friends.

401
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:23,089
I do this, you're friends with Lazarre,

402
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,820
he's friends with you,
you're friends with me.

403
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:30,333
All you gotta do to show you're a friend
 is give me Bernie Bernbaum.

404
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,837
You know it's the right thing anyway.
The shmatte steals from me.

405
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:37,933
I can't have Leo giving him a shiny new penny.

406
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,171
So the deal is,
I give you Bernie,

407
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:42,771
smooth it over with Leo
and you bail me out with Lazarre.

408
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:44,976
Yeah. Then we're all friends again.

409
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,782
You, me, Leo, the Dane.

410
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,529
Friends is a mental state.

411
00:30:54,596 --> 00:30:58,294
- What do you say, kid?
- I'll think about it.

412
00:31:01,103 --> 00:31:04,096
You hear that, Dane?
The kid's a thinker. That's terrific.

413
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:08,043
- Does he want a pillow for his head?
 - Okay, kid. Think about it.

414
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:11,912
It's a mental state.
If it'll help you think,

415
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,544
you should know
that if you don't do this thing,

416
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,180
you're not gonna be in any shape
 to walk out of here.

417
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:22,553
Would that be physically,
or just a mental state?

418
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:32,905
That ain't friendly, kid.
I make you a nice offer,

419
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,501
you give me the high hat.

420
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:18,620
Hold it.

421
00:32:31,178 --> 00:32:34,409
Jesus, Tom.

422
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,191
Just in the nick of time, huh?

423
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:24,939
Well, no harm done.
Unless your friend broke his foot.

424
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:28,376
- Where am I?
 - Where are you? Johnny Caspar's pleasure dome.

425
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:31,381
Same as when you left us
 about ten seconds ago.

426
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,816
Hello, Tom. How are ya?

427
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,081
Care to scrape a knuckle
 on your playmate here?

428
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:38,954
- No. Thanks though, Andy.
- Well, if you
change your mind,

429
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:42,358
we'll be interrogating for a while.

430
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:45,797
- What was that party about, anyway?
- We do this every weekend.

431
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:48,461
Jesus, what is the matter with you people?

432
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:51,335
Well, they said make it hurt,
so we make it hurt.

433
00:33:57,714 --> 00:33:59,649
Drink, O'Doole?

434
00:33:59,717 --> 00:34:01,947
I'm on duty.

435
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:04,818
To Volstead.

436
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:08,385
- Any news about Rug?

437
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,952
Still dead, far as I know.

438
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,760
- Get a slug out of him?
- Yeah, .22.

439
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,564
Listen, Tom,
 I'm just the chief around here,

440
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,696
so don't bother tellin' me
 if you don't happen to feel like it,

441
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,707
but what the hell is Leo doin'?

442
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:25,236
Make him listen to you, Tom.
It ain't right, all this fuss over one sheeny.

443
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:28,249
Let Caspar have Bernie.
What's one Hebrew more or less?

444
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,252
We're burnin' our meal ticket here.

445
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,550
Leo will do what suits him,
and you'll do what he tells you.

446
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:34,556
Last I heard, Leo was still running this town.

447
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,253
Yeah, well, he won't be for long if this keeps up.

448
00:34:37,328 --> 00:34:40,092
It's no good for anyone.
You said as much yourself.

449
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:44,363
First off, O'Doole, I can say what I please
to Leo and about him.

450
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:46,428
You can't.

451
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:50,101
Second, once Leo decides, that's that.

452
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:52,611
If that sticks going down,
there are plenty of coppers I know...

453
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,547
who wouldn't mind bein' chief and could swallow it clean.

454
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:59,713
Jesus, Tom, I was just speculatin'
 about a hypothesis.

455
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:01,848
I know I don't know nothin'.

456
00:35:01,924 --> 00:35:04,290
It's just a--
just a damn mess, is all.

457
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,523
Hello, Officer.
I'd like to report an intruder...

458
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:33,652
at 346 West Lewis--

459
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:37,323
Who's this?
Hello, Shad. Tom Reagan here.

460
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:43,068
- False alarm, huh?
 - Yeah. My mother. She didn't recognize me.

461
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,472
Let me talk to Mulveany. Miss me?

462
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,011
Drop dead.

463
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,138
- Mulveany here.
- Sean?

464
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,148
Tell O'Doole to get a car over
to Leo's tonight.

465
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,186
If we're banging away at Caspar,
we oughta be ready for him to bang back.

466
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,357
I was in the neighborhood, feeling a bit daffy,

467
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:04,398
so I thought I'd drop in for an aperitif.

468
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:09,069
- Rug Daniels is dead.
- Gee, that's tough.

469
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:11,332
Don't get hysterical.

470
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:15,002
I've had enough excitement for one night
without a dame going all weepy on me.

471
00:36:15,078 --> 00:36:17,205
- I barely knew the gentleman.
-Rug?

472
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,650
A bit of a shakedown artist,
not above the occasional grift.

473
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,520
Bet you'd understand that.
All in all, not a bad guy,

474
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,991
if looks, brains and personality don't count.

475
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,757
- You better hope they don't.
- Yeah, well--

476
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,425
We're none of us the saint
I hear your brother is.

477
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:36,696
- Who killed him?
- Leo thinks Caspar did.

478
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,738
- But you know better.
- I do now.

479
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:42,071
You see, Caspar just tried to buy me
 into fixing his tiff with Leo,

480
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:44,908
which he'd hardly do if he was waging war.

481
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,041
So I figure you killed him, angel.
You or St. Bernard.

482
00:36:49,118 --> 00:36:52,919
Why would I or my brother
 kill Rug Daniels or anybody else?

483
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:57,051
Rug was following you.
He knew about you and me,

484
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:59,756
and that wouldn't help
your play with Leo, would it?

485
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,924
You think I murdered someone?

486
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,094
Come on, Tom. You know me a little.

487
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,696
Nobody knows anybody.
Not that well.

488
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:09,969
You know, or you wouldn't be here.

489
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:13,411
Not at all, sugar.
I came to hear your side of the story.

490
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,111
How horrible Rug was, how he goaded you
 into it, how he tried to shake you down.

491
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:20,279
- That's not why you came either.
- Tell me why I came.

492
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:23,484
- The oldest reason there is.
- There are friendlier places to drink.

493
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,493
- Why can't you admit it?
- Admit what?

494
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:28,895
That you don't like me seeing Leo
 'cause you're jealous.

495
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:31,263
Admit that you've got a heart,

496
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,803
even though it may be small and feeble...

497
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:36,066
and you can't remember
 the last time you used it.

498
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,304
If I'd known we were gonna cast
 our feelings into words,

499
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:42,007
I'd have memorized the Song of Solomon.

500
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:47,249
Maybe that's why I like you, Tom.

501
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:50,119
I never knew anybody
that made being a son of a bitch...

502
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:52,888
such a point of pride.

503
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:55,953
Though one day you'll pay the price for it.

504
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:01,168
Okay, Verna.
But until then, let's get stinko.

505
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,798
Let's do something else first.

506
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:11,397
- Who's winning?
- We are, for the nonce.

507
00:42:11,468 --> 00:42:12,729
What's the disposition?

508
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,729
Last night, four to one.
Dana Cudahy went up with the house.

509
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,903
- And theirs?
- One burned.

510
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:19,740
- The other three?
- Lead.

511
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:21,837
- Whose?
- Leo's.

512
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:24,179
The old man's still an artist with a Thompson.

513
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,219
Yeah, do that.

514
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:34,594
Son of a bitch. No chief.

515
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:38,031
- Who's mindin' the goddamn store?
-Can't raise O'Doole?

516
00:42:38,101 --> 00:42:40,203
No, nor the mayor either.

517
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:47,437
I don't know, Leo.
 I warned you not to hit Caspar's club.

518
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:50,310
- I'm still here, ain't I?
-Caspar's play hurt you anyway.

519
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:52,872
That sorry son of a bitch
 just slit his own throat.

520
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:56,080
Listen to me, Leo.
Last night made you look vulnerable.

521
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:59,592
You don't hold elected office in this town.
 You run it because people think you run it.

522
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:02,423
Once they stop thinking it,
you stop running it.

523
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,061
I mean it, Leo.
Start taking Caspar seriously.

524
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:13,369
I know, I know. Retreat to win, give up
Bernie. That'll solve all our problems.

525
00:43:13,442 --> 00:43:15,502
Won't anymore, I'll grant you that.

526
00:43:15,578 --> 00:43:18,046
But going toe-to-toe with a psychopath
 will get you nowhere.

527
00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:20,811
It'll force people to choose sides
just when you're looking shaky.

528
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:26,486
Why aren't there any police here?

529
00:43:26,558 --> 00:43:28,583
Why weren't there any police
at your place last night?

530
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,255
- I didn't ask for any.
- I did.

531
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,199
Mother hen, huh?
What's the matter, Tommy?

532
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:40,799
- Don't you think I can take care of myself?
 - I know you can't.

533
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:43,742
Here's the smart play, Leo.
You lay back, you give Bernie up,

534
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:45,803
you let Caspar think he's made his point.

535
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:48,873
- Then you wait for him to show a weakness.
- Please, Tom.

536
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:51,182
You're sticking on Bernie.
You're sticking your neck out...

537
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:54,189
for a guy who'd chop you off at the heels
 if there was two bits in it.

538
00:43:56,694 --> 00:43:59,390
Tom,

539
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:02,797
things aren't as, uh, clear-cut as you make it.

540
00:44:04,403 --> 00:44:08,602
Bernie's--
 Well, hell,you know about me and Verna.

541
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:12,544
Things now are, uh--

542
00:44:12,613 --> 00:44:16,380
Not that I haven't been a gentleman, but--

543
00:44:18,453 --> 00:44:21,912
I plan to ask her to marry me, Tom.

544
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,997
I guess you think that's a bonehead play.

545
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:38,106
- You think she wants you to?
- How the hell do I know?

546
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:40,873
I think she does.
Yeah, of course she does.

547
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:44,815
I know you think different,
but, well, we just, uh--

548
00:44:44,884 --> 00:44:47,251
We just differ on that.

549
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:53,221
Leo, Caspar didn't kill Rug.

550
00:44:53,295 --> 00:44:57,061
- Course he did.
- No. Think about it just this one time.

551
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:59,158
- Who was Rug following?
- Huh?

552
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:02,797
It needn't have been that sinister.
Strange man follows her down a dark alleyway.

553
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:05,273
- I told you she can look after herself.
 - Verna wouldn't panic,

554
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:08,540
shoot someone just because
he was following her.

555
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:12,413
Nah, it wouldn't have happened like that,
and if it had she would have told me.

556
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:15,716
They pulled a .22 slug out of him.
A pop gun, Leo, a woman's gun.

557
00:45:15,788 --> 00:45:17,983
I know you don't like her, Tom,

558
00:45:18,057 --> 00:45:21,050
but I trust Verna as much as I trust you.

559
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:24,564
Okay, Leo.

560
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:26,930
Maybe it wasn't that innocent.

561
00:45:27,001 --> 00:45:30,665
Maybe Rug knew something she didn't like him
 knowing and wouldn't want you to know.

562
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:34,403
Rug was following her.
Maybe he knew where she was sleeping,

563
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:36,411
and who with.

564
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:42,975
Maybes don't make it so.

565
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:46,046
There's more than maybes.

566
00:45:46,124 --> 00:45:49,686
You've trusted me before, you've never
 lost anything by it. Trust me on this.

567
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:55,957
- This is too important. - I don't ask much, and I don't ask often.

568
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,504
Trust me on this.

569
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:01,838
- Tommy.
- Trust me on this, or to hell with you.

570
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:06,846
You don't mean that.

571
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:11,553
She was with me...

572
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:15,022
the night Rug
was following her,

573
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:17,060
the night you dropped by.

574
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:33,076
Oh.

575
00:48:29,218 --> 00:48:31,983
Okay, Leo. Okay.
I'll throw him out.

576
00:48:34,124 --> 00:48:36,685
Yeah, do that.

577
00:48:37,762 --> 00:48:39,957
It's the kiss-off.

578
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:43,365
If I never see him again,
it'll be soon enough.

579
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:55,739
- Hello?
- Hello, Frankie.

580
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:58,251
It's Tom.
How's the flunky business?

581
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:01,819
I've had worse.
Your ventilator mending?

582
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:07,563
- I'd like to see him.

583
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,429
Ah. All right, let me know.

584
00:49:56,756 --> 00:50:00,716
It worked, whatever you did.

585
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:04,231
Leo says we're quits.

586
00:50:04,298 --> 00:50:06,960
But you know I didn't have anything
to do with Rug.

587
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:09,765
Maybe not.

588
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:11,806
Anyway, that isn't what soured him on you.

589
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:14,207
Oh, you and me, huh?

590
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:19,609
You always take the long way around
to get what you want, don't you, Tom?

591
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,120
You could have just asked.

592
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:29,927
What did I want?

593
00:50:29,996 --> 00:50:32,624
Me.

594
00:50:58,663 --> 00:51:01,394
Yeah?

595
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:03,401
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:05,802
When?

597
00:51:05,872 --> 00:51:07,806
Okay.

598
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:15,410
You still up?

599
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:17,714
Yeah.

600
00:51:21,524 --> 00:51:24,618
What are you chewin' over?

601
00:51:24,694 --> 00:51:26,925
Dream I had once.

602
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:31,802
I was walking in the woods.
I don't know why.

603
00:51:33,371 --> 00:51:36,499
Wind came whippin'.
Blew me hat off.

604
00:51:38,477 --> 00:51:41,412
And you chased it, right?

605
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,881
You ran and ran.

606
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,114
You finally caught up to it.

607
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:51,284
And you picked it up,
but it wasn't a hat anymore.

608
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,319
It had changed into something else,
something wonderful.

609
00:51:55,397 --> 00:51:58,231
No, it stayed a hat.

610
00:51:58,301 --> 00:52:00,792
And no, I didn't chase it.

611
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:05,973
Nothing more foolish
than a man chasin' his hat.

612
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:08,274
Where are you going?

613
00:52:08,346 --> 00:52:11,110
Just have to do a few things.

614
00:52:11,182 --> 00:52:13,253
You and Leo might still be able
to patch things up.

615
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:14,740
Me and Leo are finished.

616
00:52:14,775 --> 00:52:17,470
-Nothing's gonna change that.
- You never know.

617
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:19,258
He's got a big heart.

618
00:52:19,308 --> 00:52:21,788
 We're quits as far as I'm concerned,
 never mind him.

619
00:52:22,162 --> 00:52:26,429
And if Leo did want me back,
he's an even bigger sap than I thought.

620
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:28,993
Then why don't we just
pick up and leave town?

621
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:31,938
There's nothing keeping you here.

622
00:52:32,007 --> 00:52:33,942
I know there's nothing keeping me.

623
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:37,343
- What about Bernie?
- He could go with us.

624
00:52:38,582 --> 00:52:40,744
You, me and Bernie?
Where would we go, Verna?

625
00:52:40,818 --> 00:52:42,752
Niagara Falls?

626
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,755
Why do you hate him?

627
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:46,757
- I don't hate anyone.
-Or like anyone.

628
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:54,026
Where is Bernie?

629
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,592
- Why?
- Leo can't protect him anymore.

630
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,129
I oughta tell him to skip.

631
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,142
The Royale, room 302.

632
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:11,046
I guess we both double-crossed Leo, huh?

633
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,055
There's no gettin' around that.

634
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,990
I guess he's well rid of both of us.

635
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:21,465
The two of us, we're about
bad enough to deserve each other.

636
00:53:24,937 --> 00:53:26,872
Are we?

637
00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:31,877
We're a couple of heels, Tom.

638
00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:34,642
Yes, we are.

639
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:43,019
Hello, Tom.

640
00:53:43,092 --> 00:53:46,324
Uh, you know O'Doole and the mayor.

641
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:49,696
- Hello, boys.
- Tom's a big booster. Always has been.

642
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:53,864
That's fine, that's fine.
Well, Tom and I got the proverbial fat to chew.

643
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:56,737
-Just let us know if you need anything.
- Yeah. Happy days.

644
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:59,869
Have a seat, kid.
Yeah, that's it.

645
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,279
So,you had enough time to think about things?

646
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,447
- Yeah, well, uh, circumstances have changed.
- Don't I know it.

647
00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:10,616
Last night I know the Dane
was disappointed the bulls showed up...

648
00:54:10,692 --> 00:54:13,355
before Frankie and Tic-Tac
really pinned your ears back,

649
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:17,890
but I said, ''Relax, Eddie.
 I got a feeling about this kid.

650
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:22,199
The kid and Leo are gonna go bust-o.
 Matter of time.''

651
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:24,969
I said, ''The kid is too smart for Leo.''
 That's what I said.

652
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:28,103
Like a psychic. Ask the Dane if I did.
 Like a goddamn psychic.

653
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,671
-Go ahead, ask him.
- You vouch for that psychic business?

654
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:33,310
- That's right, smart guy.
-I know you knew...

655
00:54:33,386 --> 00:54:36,412
protecting the shmatte was a dumb idea.

656
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:40,187
I know you've been wise
to all of Leo's dumb ideas lately.

657
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,387
Only a matter of time-- bust-o.

658
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:45,627
That's why last night
we didn't put the arm on you, only Leo.

659
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,884
Seeing how you squiffed your play on Leo,
 I can only be so grateful.

660
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:52,195
Oh, that's real brave
coming from Little Miss Punching Bag.

661
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:53,564
Okay, Eddie.

662
00:54:53,642 --> 00:54:56,908
- Friends now, huh?
- Nuts.

663
00:54:58,582 --> 00:55:00,517
So, I guess you'll be looking for a job, eh, kid?

664
00:55:00,585 --> 00:55:03,247
I might be.

665
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:05,347
You got references?
You been to college?

666
00:55:05,424 --> 00:55:09,019
We only take yeggs what's been to college.
 Ain't that right, Dane?

667
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:15,164
I'm joking, of course.
We all know you could be useful to us,

668
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:17,170
a smart kid such as yourself.

669
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:21,039
The man who walks behind the man,
who whispers in his ear.

670
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,772
- I guess you could be useful in spades.
- Yeah, I can do plenty for you.

671
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:29,284
- Can you get Leo off me?
 - I'm tellin' you not to worry about Leo.

672
00:55:29,352 --> 00:55:31,287
- We got plans for him.
- Oh,yeah?

673
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:34,188
- Like what?
- Not so fast there, ''kaputnik.''

674
00:55:34,258 --> 00:55:36,784
I-I think what the Dane is trying to say is,

675
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:38,795
there'll be time to talk about that.

676
00:55:38,863 --> 00:55:41,230
We can table that for a later date.

677
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:47,298
See, last time we jawed,
you gave me the high hat.

678
00:55:47,374 --> 00:55:49,899
I guess I'm sayin'...

679
00:55:49,976 --> 00:55:53,504
you gotta put something on the table first.

680
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:56,312
- Ante up.
- Fair enough. Where do we start?

681
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:59,912
Hear that, Dane? All business.
I told you he was a good kid.

682
00:55:59,988 --> 00:56:02,184
''Where do we start?''
All business.

683
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:05,352
Well, we can start, for instance,
with the shmatte.

684
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,397
Like, where's the shmatte?
You could maybe tell us that.

685
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:11,595
The Royale, room 302.
And you might find Mink with him.

686
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,638
The hell you say.

687
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,832
Sure. Bernie and Mink are cozy as lice.

688
00:56:15,907 --> 00:56:19,207
- And it ain't just business.
- This guy is lying.

689
00:56:19,278 --> 00:56:21,212
- Why would I?
- This guy is wrong.

690
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,386
This guy is all wrong.
Mink is clean and this clown is a smart guy.

691
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:30,180
It's easy enough to find out, ain't it?

692
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:35,863
You find Mink, you bring him back here.

693
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:41,525
Go to the car. I'm gonna send Frankie
and Tic-Tac with you to the Royale.

694
00:56:41,604 --> 00:56:43,869
If Bernie's there,

695
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,306
Frankie and Tic-Tac'll take care of him.

696
00:56:46,376 --> 00:56:48,777
And if he's not there?

697
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:52,282
I'll sit facing the corner in a funny hat.

698
00:56:53,919 --> 00:56:56,615
- Get your little hebe ass in the car.

699
00:56:56,688 --> 00:56:58,782
Come on,you skel.

700
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:00,951
What are you doing to me?

701
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:07,928
- Sit still, hymie.
- You can't be part of this.

702
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:49,946
- What?
- That's right.

703
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:52,988
The boss wants you to do it.
Make sure you're with the good guys.

704
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,053
Ya gotta remember to put one in his brain.

705
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:01,155
Your first shot puts him down.
Then you put one in his brain.

706
00:58:01,233 --> 00:58:03,326
Then he's dead.
Then we go home.

707
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:09,269
Get up and walk.

708
00:58:09,342 --> 00:58:11,607
I can't get up. I can't get up.

709
00:58:36,775 --> 00:58:39,835
Tommy, you can't do this.
You don't bump guys.

710
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,245
You're not like those animals back there.

711
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:46,881
It's not right, Tom.

712
00:58:46,953 --> 00:58:49,388
They can't make us do this.

713
00:58:49,456 --> 00:58:53,689
It's a wrong situation. They can't make us
 different people than we are.

714
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:55,696
We're not muscle.
I never killed anybody.

715
00:58:55,764 --> 00:58:58,359
I used a little information for a chisel, that's all.

716
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:01,096
It's my nature, Tom. I can't help it.

717
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,005
Somebody hands me an angle, I play it.
I don't deserve to die for that.

718
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,009
Do you think I do?

719
00:59:12,517 --> 00:59:16,010
But I tell you what--
I never crossed a friend.

720
00:59:16,088 --> 00:59:18,455
I never killed anybody,
I never crossed a friend.

721
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:20,459
We're not like those animals.

722
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:22,461
This is not us.

723
00:59:25,266 --> 00:59:28,429
It's a dream, Tommy!
I'm praying to you!

724
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:30,471
I can't die.

725
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:32,473
I can't die...

726
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:36,273
out here in the woods like a dumb animal.

727
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:38,780
In the woods like a dumb animal!

728
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:41,818
Like a--
Like a dumb animal!

729
00:59:41,885 --> 00:59:45,617
I can't-- I can't--
 I can't die out here in the woods...

730
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,284
like a dumb animal.

731
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,762
I can't... die!

732
00:59:55,569 --> 00:59:57,503
I'm praying to you.

733
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:02,000
Look in your heart.

734
01:00:02,076 --> 01:00:04,169
I'm praying to you.

735
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:09,680
Look in your heart.
I'm praying to you.

736
01:00:09,752 --> 01:00:12,449
Look in your heart.

737
01:00:12,522 --> 01:00:15,890
I'm praying to you!

738
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,053
Look in your heart!

739
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,728
I'm praying to you!
Look in your heart.

740
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:25,930
I'm praying to you!

741
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:30,305
Look in your heart!
Look in your heart!

742
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,641
You can't kill me.

743
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,614
- Look in your heart.

744
01:00:50,867 --> 01:00:53,860
- Tommy--
- Shut up. You're dead. Get me?

745
01:00:56,474 --> 01:00:59,069
I understand. I'm dead.

746
01:00:59,144 --> 01:01:01,578
- God bless you.
-Shut up.

747
01:01:01,647 --> 01:01:05,049
You have to disappear for good.
No one can see you. No one can know.

748
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:08,384
- God bless you.
-Go somewhere no one knows you.

749
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,914
Anyone sees you, you really are dead.
 You're not my problem anymore.

750
01:01:11,992 --> 01:01:14,427
Of course not.
You've done your share. Thank you.

751
01:01:14,496 --> 01:01:17,136
- Don't worry. I understand.
-Shut up. Shut up.

752
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:18,107
Thank you.

753
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,784
Shut up. Let's get out of here
 before I change my mind.

754
01:01:21,237 --> 01:01:23,706
God bless you.

755
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,745
Put one in his brain?

756
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:00,008
- Yeah.
Atta boy.

757
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:19,135
Mink? Tom Reagan. Where you been?

758
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:28,448
Will you look?
Eddie Dane's been looking for you.

759
01:02:28,517 --> 01:02:30,452
- Bernie's dead.
-Jesus Christ!

760
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,786
Stop wailing and listen to me. Caspar knows
 you were in on selling out his fix.

761
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:35,907
Who the hell gave him that idea?

762
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:39,280
 I guess I gave him that idea.
 Sorry. It just slipped out.

763
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,380
What are you trying to do?

764
01:02:40,474 --> 01:02:43,113
Shut up and let me talk.
You lay low till Caspar cools off.

765
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:48,637
Then tell him the Dane was in on the sellout,
 and I'll make Caspar go easy on you.

766
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,644
- You got me into this mess.
- That's right, I got you into this.

767
01:02:51,712 --> 01:02:53,456
Just remember, Mink.
 I'm the only one who can get you out.

768
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:54,490
Wait a minute, Tom.

769
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:58,217
Waah! Uuh!

770
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:09,121
Hello, Terry.
Getting out the vote?

771
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:14,832
A message from Leo. Leo says
 if you're smart you'll sit this one out,

772
01:03:14,906 --> 01:03:17,398
not that he cares one way or the other.

773
01:03:17,476 --> 01:03:22,005
Leo says if you're on the wrong side
 you take your chances like anybody else.

774
01:03:22,082 --> 01:03:24,586
Leo says he gives no special favors, that's all.

775
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:27,621
Tell Leo he's not God on the throne.

776
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,319
He's just a cheap political boss with more hair tonic than brains.

777
01:03:31,393 --> 01:03:34,989
Uhh!

778
01:03:37,635 --> 01:03:39,728
Did Leo say that as well?

779
01:03:39,804 --> 01:03:41,738
No, I said that.

780
01:03:42,908 --> 01:03:45,342
Cross Leo, next time I'll say plenty.

781
01:03:52,585 --> 01:03:55,521
When you're right,you're right.

782
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:58,889
But you never say,
''I told you so.''

783
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,053
So what am I right about?

784
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,127
Well, I'll tell you.

785
01:04:05,201 --> 01:04:09,036
But first you gotta promise
not to say I told you so.

786
01:04:09,106 --> 01:04:13,236
I never say that,
and I don't like people who do.

787
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,212
Mink was robbing me right along
with the shmatte.

788
01:04:18,282 --> 01:04:20,217
What convinced you of that?

789
01:04:20,285 --> 01:04:22,583
Mink took a powder.
We can't find him.

790
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:25,090
The Dane, he's making excuses for him.

791
01:04:25,158 --> 01:04:27,592
But personally, I think you was right.

792
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:30,290
I think that Mink and Bernie was in it together.

793
01:04:30,364 --> 01:04:33,800
I think Mink heard that you bumped
 the shmatte and lit out.

794
01:04:33,868 --> 01:04:36,167
Lousy son of a bitch.

795
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:41,401
- I told you so.
- What?

796
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:47,348
You got a lip on you.
That's all right.

797
01:04:47,418 --> 01:04:50,513
I don't generally care for it,
but that's all right.

798
01:04:51,856 --> 01:04:54,791
You was a good sport to bump the shmatte.

799
01:04:55,861 --> 01:04:57,954
How do you know Mink skipped?

800
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,864
- Because the Dane can't find him.
- So he says.

801
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:05,030
- Meaning what exactly?
-Maybe nothing.

802
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:09,167
I didn't give it much thought, 'cause
a guy'll say anything when his number is up.

803
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:11,974
But, uh,just before I bumped Bernie,

804
01:05:12,047 --> 01:05:15,141
he swore to me that Eddie Dane
 and Mink were setting him up--

805
01:05:15,217 --> 01:05:18,153
that they were the ones who sold out your fix.

806
01:05:26,732 --> 01:05:28,666
Well, uh--

807
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:31,066
Well, like you say, uh, a guy'll say anything.

808
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,571
So why isn't Eddie Dane here?

809
01:05:35,341 --> 01:05:37,970
Well, he don't care for you, kid.

810
01:05:39,046 --> 01:05:41,982
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

811
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:45,542
After you left us, he tried
to sell me on a double-cross.

812
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,522
He says to me, why don't we
double-cross you and give you the bump...

813
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:50,525
after we get the shmatte.

814
01:05:50,593 --> 01:05:54,587
Well, I figure a deal's a deal.
You're square with me.

815
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:59,398
You bump the shmatte, I hold up my end.
It's a question of ethics.

816
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:03,771
Everything above board so everybody knows
 who's a friend, who's an enemy.

817
01:06:05,144 --> 01:06:08,342
So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me.

818
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:10,348
We go back.

819
01:06:12,252 --> 01:06:17,350
Of course there's always that wild card
when, uh, love is involved.

820
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:22,529
I know Mink is Eddie Dane's boy.

821
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:27,094
Still, I--
I don't make it that way.

822
01:06:28,939 --> 01:06:32,306
- Then there's nothing to worry about.
- Yeah.

823
01:06:32,376 --> 01:06:36,711
Papa, Papa, I got a prize from the sister!
Papa, Papa, I got a prize from the sister!

824
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:40,183
- Papa, Papa, I got a prize from the sister!
 - Yeah.Just a minute.

825
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:42,447
- Of course, then, there's no reason-- Shut up!
- Papa, Papa, I got--

826
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:45,923
You take a page out of this guy's book.

827
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:50,020
A little less you talk, a little more you think!

828
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,667
Kids. You gotta be firm.

829
01:06:54,736 --> 01:06:59,469
Anyways, there's no reason not to check things out.

830
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:02,943
If Mink is around, I want you to find him.
He can tell us what's what.

831
01:07:03,012 --> 01:07:06,073
What's the matter?
Somebody hit you?

832
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,983
What's the matter?
Aren't we friends anymore?

833
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:11,989
If you find him, I wanna talk to him alone.

834
01:07:12,057 --> 01:07:14,685
That's the way you get
the straight dope--man to man.

835
01:07:14,759 --> 01:07:18,457
Just me, Mink... and my friend Roscoe.

836
01:07:18,531 --> 01:07:21,194
You understand what I'm saying?

837
01:07:21,268 --> 01:07:23,702
- It ain't complicated.

838
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:38,877
You should leave town for a few days.
 Things are gonna heat up around here.

839
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:41,390
Go to the Palisades.
I'll join you soon as I'm done.

840
01:07:41,459 --> 01:07:44,394
I can't find Bernie.
Did you find him?

841
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:47,631
Yeah.

842
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:49,894
Is he leaving?

843
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:54,338
He, uh-- He left.

844
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:57,002
- He say where to?
- He didn't say.

845
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,272
- You--
- Thanks.

846
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,802
- That's Bernie's sister, ain't it?
- Beats me.

847
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:21,270
- What's he seeing her for?
- Beats me. Maybe--

848
01:08:21,339 --> 01:08:25,106
Shut up. Get lost.

849
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:27,737
I'll see where
the twist flops.

850
01:08:28,949 --> 01:08:32,441
You know who I am?

851
01:08:32,519 --> 01:08:35,182
Yeah,Johnny Caspar's shadow.
What, did he stay in bed today?

852
01:08:35,256 --> 01:08:39,250
Jesus. I open my mouth,
the whole world turns smart.

853
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:42,855
- You're Leo's twist, right?
- Me and Leo are through.

854
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:45,696
Yeah? So you're sluttin' around
 with Tom now, huh?

855
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,533
You get outta here.

856
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:50,903
Okay. See you later.

857
01:08:52,977 --> 01:08:55,412
Before I go,
what's your boyfriend up to?

858
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,607
- Nothing I know about.
- Yeah?

859
01:08:57,682 --> 01:08:59,776
That doesn't
figure for me--

860
01:08:59,852 --> 01:09:02,980
you dumpin' Leo
 for the guy who put a bullet in your brother.

861
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,557
He didn't tell you?

862
01:09:11,632 --> 01:09:13,566
Spin her, Eddie.

863
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,138
Ooh!

864
01:09:33,225 --> 01:09:37,390
- You Leo's?
- Yeah. He wanted her looked-out for.

865
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:41,662
Well,you did a bang-upjob.
I'll be sure to tell him.

866
01:09:41,735 --> 01:09:45,797
- Where's Leo?
- If I tell you, how do I know you won't kill me?

867
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:51,040
Because if you told me and I killed you and you
 were lying, I wouldn't get to kill you then.

868
01:09:51,113 --> 01:09:52,921
- Where's Leo?
- He's moving around.

869
01:09:53,483 --> 01:09:56,367
He's getting his mob together
tomorrow at Whiskey Nick's.

870
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:57,576
You sure?

871
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:59,989
Check it. It's gold.

872
01:10:00,057 --> 01:10:03,653
You know what,yegg?
I believe you.

873
01:10:25,853 --> 01:10:27,879
Go ahead and run, sweetie.

874
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:31,448
I'll track down all of you whores.

875
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:35,431
Hello, Bernie. Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

876
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:38,495
Hello, Tom.

877
01:11:38,572 --> 01:11:42,339
I thought I'd do that,
 since you didn't seem to be in.

878
01:11:42,411 --> 01:11:46,576
Figured it was a bad idea to wait in the hall,
seeing as I'm supposed to be dead.

879
01:11:49,685 --> 01:11:52,120
How'd you know it was me?

880
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:54,680
You're the only one I know
 who'd knock and then break in.

881
01:11:54,758 --> 01:11:56,750
Your other friends wouldn't break in?

882
01:11:56,828 --> 01:12:00,025
My other friends want to kill me,
so they wouldn't knock.

883
01:12:00,098 --> 01:12:02,533
What's on your mind. Bernie?

884
01:12:04,937 --> 01:12:07,338
Things.

885
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:12,869
I guess you must be angry.
I'm supposed to be gone far away.

886
01:12:12,947 --> 01:12:16,042
I guess it seems sort of irresponsible,
my being here.

887
01:12:18,554 --> 01:12:22,047
And I was gonna leave.
Honest, I was.

888
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:24,059
But then I started thinking...

889
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:26,995
if I stuck around,
that would not be good for you.

890
01:12:27,064 --> 01:12:29,794
Then I started thinking that--

891
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:32,302
that might not be bad for me.

892
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:38,271
You didn't see the play you gave me.

893
01:12:38,344 --> 01:12:40,608
I mean, what am I gonna do?

894
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,616
If I leave, I got nothing.

895
01:12:43,684 --> 01:12:46,414
No money, no friends, nothing.

896
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,649
If I stay, I got you.

897
01:12:48,723 --> 01:12:53,252
Anyone finds out I'm alive...
you're dead, so...

898
01:12:55,397 --> 01:12:57,423
I got-- I got you, Tommy.

899
01:12:59,936 --> 01:13:03,338
What's the matter?
You got nothing to crack wise about?

900
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:05,841
Bernie ain't
so funny anymore?

901
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:12,049
I guess I made kind of
a fool of myself out there...

902
01:13:14,254 --> 01:13:16,745
bawling away like a twist.

903
01:13:16,823 --> 01:13:19,258
I guess--

904
01:13:19,326 --> 01:13:21,260
I guess I turned yellow.

905
01:13:21,328 --> 01:13:25,026
- You didn't tell anyone about that?
 - No.

906
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,295
Of course, you know about it.

907
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,401
It's a painful memory...

908
01:13:35,312 --> 01:13:40,148
and I can't help remembering
that you put the finger on me,

909
01:13:40,218 --> 01:13:43,312
and you took me out there to whack me.

910
01:13:43,388 --> 01:13:47,018
I know... you didn't.
I know.

911
01:13:47,092 --> 01:13:50,893
- You didn't shoot me, but--
- But what have I done for you lately?

912
01:13:50,964 --> 01:13:53,023
Don't smart me.

913
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:57,003
See, I want to watch you squirm.

914
01:13:58,573 --> 01:14:01,008
I want to see you sweat a little.

915
01:14:02,911 --> 01:14:05,005
And when you smart me...

916
01:14:06,549 --> 01:14:08,983
it ruins it.

917
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,265
There's one other thing I want.

918
01:14:23,169 --> 01:14:25,934
I want to see Johnny Caspar cold and stiff.

919
01:14:26,006 --> 01:14:29,407
That's what you'll do for your friend Bernie.

920
01:14:32,513 --> 01:14:35,778
In the meantime, I'll stay out of sight.

921
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:39,287
But if Caspar ain't stiff in a couple of days...

922
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:41,449
I start eating in restaurants.

923
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,571
Oof.

924
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:04,248
Uuh!

925
01:15:04,318 --> 01:15:06,411
You make me laugh, Tommy.

926
01:15:06,487 --> 01:15:10,049
You're gonna catch cold.
Then you're no good to me.

927
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:13,061
What were you gonna do if you caught me?

928
01:15:13,129 --> 01:15:16,565
I'd just squirt a few,
and then you'd let me go again.

929
01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:26,907
Hello, Tad.
How's the club holding up?

930
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:30,178
We're managing to squeak by without you.
 Got Lazarre's money?

931
01:15:30,303 --> 01:15:31,106
No.

932
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:33,408
You're not supposed to be here
 since you turned rat.

933
01:15:33,508 --> 01:15:36,222
Relax, Tad.
Leo isn't around, is he?

934
01:15:36,556 --> 01:15:40,180
Last couple of days you booked any heavy
 bets on a long shot at Saturday's fights?

935
01:15:40,336 --> 01:15:42,321
Why the hell should I tell you?

936
01:15:43,532 --> 01:15:45,897
The truth is, Tad, no reason on Earth.

937
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,800
Saturday's fights?

938
01:15:51,374 --> 01:15:55,334
Drop Johnson put two grand
 on one yesterday--

939
01:15:55,412 --> 01:15:58,848
on Sailor Reese, an undercard bum.

940
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:01,977
DropJohnson.
He play your book much?

941
01:16:02,053 --> 01:16:05,353
- Are you kidding?
 I didn't even know he could count.

942
01:16:05,424 --> 01:16:07,688
Jesus. You bring them with you?

943
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,162
Hello, Brian.
Still fighting the good fight?

944
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:13,529
Hello, Tom.
Neither rain nor wind nor snow.

945
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,694
That's the mailman. O'Doole here?

946
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:25,113
Hello, O'Doole.
You don't look happy.

947
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:27,308
Look at this mess.

948
01:16:27,384 --> 01:16:30,684
Guttin' the golden calf again.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

949
01:16:30,755 --> 01:16:34,452
Yeah, it's awful confusing.
You know a yegg named DropJohnson?

950
01:16:34,525 --> 01:16:37,324
- We spanked him a couple of times.
- Where does he flop?

951
01:16:37,396 --> 01:16:39,591
- Terminal Hotel, Bay Street.

952
01:16:39,664 --> 01:16:44,068
Jesus! Look, don't nobody ask me
 since I'm just the chief around here,

953
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:46,231
but I'll tell you my opinion.

954
01:16:46,306 --> 01:16:50,675
Caspar is just as crazy as Leo,
and an ''eye-tie'' into the bargain.

955
01:16:50,745 --> 01:16:53,908
What's the matter, O'Doole?
Doesn't anything ever suit you?

956
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,926
Hop in, Tom.
We been lookin'for you.

957
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:09,398
- I'm busy.
- Hop in anyway.

958
01:17:09,467 --> 01:17:12,733
You can't hijack me, Tic-Tac.
We're on the same side now.

959
01:17:12,805 --> 01:17:15,603
Or didn't you get that far in school?

960
01:17:24,952 --> 01:17:26,817
How'd you get the fat lip?

961
01:17:26,887 --> 01:17:31,257
- Old war wound. Acts up around morons.
- Very smart.

962
01:17:31,326 --> 01:17:34,455
What were you doing at the club,
talking things over with Leo?

963
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:37,466
Don't think so hard, Eddie.
You might sprain something.

964
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:40,264
You are so goddamn smart.

965
01:17:40,337 --> 01:17:42,271
Except you ain't.

966
01:17:42,339 --> 01:17:45,309
I get you, smart guy.
I know what you are.

967
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:47,310
Straight as a corkscrew.

968
01:17:47,378 --> 01:17:49,313
Mr. Inside Out-ski,

969
01:17:49,381 --> 01:17:53,512
like some goddamn Bolshevik
 picking up his orders from Yegg Central.

970
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:55,680
You think you're
so goddamn smart.

971
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,950
You join upJohnny Caspar,

972
01:17:58,024 --> 01:18:00,118
you bump Bernie Bernbaum.

973
01:18:01,329 --> 01:18:04,731
Up is down. Black is white.

974
01:18:06,068 --> 01:18:09,129
Well, I think you're half smart.

975
01:18:09,205 --> 01:18:11,799
I think you were straight with your frail,

976
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:14,470
I think you were queer with Johnny Caspar...

977
01:18:14,545 --> 01:18:18,743
and I think you'd sooner join
a ladies' league than gun a guy down.

978
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:23,220
Then I hear from these two geniuses
 they never even saw this rub-out take place.

979
01:18:23,288 --> 01:18:24,934
Boss said to have him do it.
He didn't say nothing about--

980
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:25,898
 Shut up!

981
01:18:27,226 --> 01:18:30,390
Or maybe you still got too many teeth.

982
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:37,198
Everyone is so goddamn smart.

983
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:41,038
Well, we'll go out to Miller's Crossing...

984
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:44,045
and we'll see who's smart.

985
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:12,407
You understand if we don't find
a stiff out here, we leave a fresh one.

986
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:32,369
Where are your friends when you need 'em, huh?

987
01:19:33,605 --> 01:19:36,039
Where's Leo now?

988
01:19:38,011 --> 01:19:40,445
Hey, Tic-Tac!

989
01:19:40,513 --> 01:19:44,348
You ever notice
 how the snappy dialogue dries up...

990
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:46,978
once a guy starts soiling his union suit?

991
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:35,007
Okay. There's nothing out here.

992
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:52,862
- Think about this... smart guy.

993
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:55,835
It's hanky time.

994
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:03,942
- Birds have been at him.

995
01:21:04,013 --> 01:21:06,505
Jesus Christ.

996
01:21:31,146 --> 01:21:35,082
Told you to put one in his brain,
not in his stinkin' face!

997
01:21:39,088 --> 01:21:42,820
I told you, Dane.
We heard two shots.

998
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,486
Hello, Drop.

999
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:18,634
How are the Katzenjammers?

1000
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:21,432
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?

1001
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:25,002
Had any visitors?

1002
01:22:25,076 --> 01:22:27,169
Uhh, no.

1003
01:22:27,245 --> 01:22:29,180
Not ever, Drop?

1004
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,239
Not lately.

1005
01:22:31,317 --> 01:22:33,878
Then you must be happy to see me.

1006
01:22:37,023 --> 01:22:38,958
So, uh...

1007
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:42,894
you didn't see Bernie Bernbaum
before he was shown across.

1008
01:22:42,964 --> 01:22:44,990
Uh, no.

1009
01:22:45,067 --> 01:22:47,126
Seen him since?

1010
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:51,571
One last question, Drop.

1011
01:22:51,641 --> 01:22:56,238
You got a lot of money on tomorrow's fight.

1012
01:22:56,313 --> 01:23:00,478
That your bet, or, uh...
you placing it for a friend?

1013
01:23:00,552 --> 01:23:02,486
No, no, no, it's my bet.

1014
01:23:02,554 --> 01:23:07,254
- I just have a good feeling about that fight.
- A good feeling, huh?

1015
01:23:07,326 --> 01:23:09,955
When did a feeling return to your head?

1016
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:12,658
You've outgrown that one.

1017
01:23:12,733 --> 01:23:14,929
Must be all the thinking you been doing.

1018
01:23:15,003 --> 01:23:18,097
Tell Bernie something's come up,
he has to get in touch.

1019
01:23:18,173 --> 01:23:21,166
There'll be nothing stirring
 till I talk to him.

1020
01:23:53,515 --> 01:23:58,749
All right, anyone left in there,
come on out grabbing air. You know the drill.

1021
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:17,305
Aah!

1022
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:02,996
Hello, Tom.
Where you been hiding?

1023
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,329
Hither and yon.
Is the mayor in?

1024
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:07,892
- He's with Mr. Caspar.
- That's who I'm looking for.

1025
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:11,168
- Scare me up some gargle, will you?
- Sure. I'll announce you.

1026
01:25:11,241 --> 01:25:14,006
Don't bother. I'm well-liked.

1027
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:21,909
-Assistants, maybe.
- For a mayor, you don't hear so hot.

1028
01:25:21,987 --> 01:25:25,014
I said head.
Head of the assessor's office.

1029
01:25:25,091 --> 01:25:29,256
- But there are two of them.
- I can count. Co-heads.

1030
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:32,424
Johnny, needless to say,
this office will do anything in its power...

1031
01:25:32,499 --> 01:25:35,094
to assist you and your cousins.

1032
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,390
We did it for Leo, of course,
on countless occasions.

1033
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:42,833
Damn right. Had every potato-eater
from County Cork on the public tit.

1034
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:45,346
But there's a way we do things,

1035
01:25:45,414 --> 01:25:47,501
hallowed by usage and consecrated by time.

1036
01:25:48,053 --> 01:25:51,855
When we put people on the pad
when Leo was running things--

1037
01:25:51,955 --> 01:25:53,405
Leo ain't runnin' things!

1038
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:58,195
I ain't interested in ancient history!
I'm runnin'things now!

1039
01:25:58,263 --> 01:26:00,755
Nobody can appreciate it more than I.

1040
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:03,131
I can give them jobs.
I can give them good jobs.

1041
01:26:03,202 --> 01:26:06,366
I can even give them jobs where
 they won't have to perform any work,

1042
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:09,272
where their lack of English
 will be no impediment, but I can't--

1043
01:26:09,342 --> 01:26:11,607
What is this, the high hat?

1044
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:16,913
Tom, can you explain it to him?
 I can put them in public works, but I can't--

1045
01:26:16,985 --> 01:26:18,919
You can do whatever the hell
Caspar tells you.

1046
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:21,456
I don't remember all this double talk
when Leo gave you an order.

1047
01:26:21,524 --> 01:26:25,790
- Tom, Jesus!
- Stop whimpering and do as you're told.

1048
01:26:25,862 --> 01:26:29,060
- You can start by gettin'out of here.
 -Johnny, it's my office.

1049
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:34,128
Get out of here! Take it on the heel
 and toe before I whack you one!

1050
01:26:36,374 --> 01:26:38,775
- You two beat it.

1051
01:26:38,845 --> 01:26:42,976
- Yeah, go and keep the mayor company.

1052
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:46,110
I'll take care
of ya's later.

1053
01:26:55,598 --> 01:26:58,534
- Runnin' things--
it ain't all gravy.

1054
01:26:58,602 --> 01:27:02,733
- What's the fireworks?
-Knocking over one of Leo's clubs.

1055
01:27:02,807 --> 01:27:05,935
Son of a bitch won't go belly up.

1056
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:09,139
I'm sorry, kid.
I heard about your little ride this morning.

1057
01:27:09,214 --> 01:27:11,148
Yeah, well, sorry don't fix things.

1058
01:27:11,216 --> 01:27:15,051
We could just as easily have missed
 Bernie's corpse, and I'd be dead now.

1059
01:27:15,121 --> 01:27:18,888
I know, I know, but that don't mean
 the Dane's up to anything.

1060
01:27:18,959 --> 01:27:22,793
So he hears a rumor that Bernie ain't dead.
 These stories pop up.

1061
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:26,095
Any stories about Bernie being alive
the Dane's made up himself.

1062
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:30,036
You don't know that.
 It don't make sense. Why would he?

1063
01:27:30,106 --> 01:27:32,540
There could be a damn good reason...

1064
01:27:34,278 --> 01:27:37,111
if you got a fixed fight coming up.

1065
01:27:39,417 --> 01:27:42,511
- Do you?
- Maybe.

1066
01:27:44,189 --> 01:27:48,216
Okay, yeah, sure. Tomorrow night.
The fix is in. What of it?

1067
01:27:48,294 --> 01:27:50,559
- The Dane know about it?
- Yeah.

1068
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,029
Okay, I get it.

1069
01:27:57,104 --> 01:27:59,707
If the Dane's been selling you out
on these fights and means to again,

1070
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:01,788
 he's gonna have to have somebody else
 to point the finger at.

1071
01:28:01,888 --> 01:28:02,809
 Yeah, I get it.

1072
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:05,780
With Bernie dead, there ain't a hell
of a lot of people he can point to.

1073
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:09,614
Yeah, the Dane sells me out,
makes pretend Bernie's still doing it.

1074
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:11,621
That's real pretty.

1075
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:15,786
Bernie leaked the fix,
and you take the fall for not killing him.

1076
01:28:17,896 --> 01:28:22,334
But I don't know.
Why would Eddie cross me like that? Money?

1077
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:24,631
Okay, everybody likes money,

1078
01:28:24,704 --> 01:28:27,902
but somehow it just don't seem like him.

1079
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:32,504
- And I know the Dane.
- Nobody knows anybody. Not that well.

1080
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:35,310
Money don't mean that much to him.

1081
01:28:35,383 --> 01:28:37,614
Then it's not just the money he's after.

1082
01:28:37,686 --> 01:28:41,418
- He's got a wart on his fanny.
- Huh?

1083
01:28:41,491 --> 01:28:45,052
A wart on his fanny giving him the fidgets.

1084
01:28:45,128 --> 01:28:47,563
Maybe he's sick of sitting on the couch.

1085
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:50,794
Maybe behind your desk don't look
 like a bad place to move to.

1086
01:28:50,868 --> 01:28:53,337
Kid, you got a lip on you.

1087
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,040
But you're honest.

1088
01:28:57,110 --> 01:29:00,705
That's something we can't get enough of
 in this business.

1089
01:29:04,251 --> 01:29:07,710
I'll admit since last we jawed...

1090
01:29:07,789 --> 01:29:10,189
my stomach's been seizing up on me.

1091
01:29:10,258 --> 01:29:13,228
If the Dane's saying
we should double-cross you--

1092
01:29:13,295 --> 01:29:17,562
You double-cross once, where's it all end?

1093
01:29:17,634 --> 01:29:20,432
An interesting ethical question.

1094
01:29:25,877 --> 01:29:29,109
I'll find the Dane, talk to him,
straighten things out.

1095
01:29:29,181 --> 01:29:31,778
- Sure, talk to him. Have a chat.
 - I'll take care of it.

1096
01:29:31,878 --> 01:29:33,941
- Ask him if he's selling you out.
I'm sure he'll come clean.

1097
01:29:34,385 --> 01:29:35,621
I'll take care of it.

1098
01:29:35,755 --> 01:29:37,975
- You're swimmin' in it.
- I said I'd take care of it!

1099
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:52,432
-Johnny.

1100
01:29:52,508 --> 01:29:56,843
My chin's hanging out right alongside yours.

1101
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:01,919
I'd worry a lot less if I thought
 you were worrying enough.

1102
01:30:06,392 --> 01:30:08,326
But I am, kid.

1103
01:30:12,065 --> 01:30:13,999
Christ.

1104
01:30:15,236 --> 01:30:17,636
Running things.

1105
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:30,318
- Yeah? I got your message.

1106
01:30:30,387 --> 01:30:33,550
Oh, Bernie.
 I had a dream about you the other day.

1107
01:30:33,624 --> 01:30:37,152
- Yeah? A nightmare?
- On the contrary. Very sweet.

1108
01:30:37,229 --> 01:30:40,427
I dreamt you were lying out
at Miller's Crossing with your face blown off.

1109
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,992
You get a kick out of that?
- I was in stitches.

1110
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:46,938
- It's Mink, isn't it?
 - I came back. He wasn't happy to see me.

1111
01:30:47,007 --> 01:30:48,941
- Can you beat that?
- Some friend.

1112
01:30:49,009 --> 01:30:50,944
Yeah. You know what a nervous boy he was.

1113
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:54,846
I figured you're a friend,
 maybe you could use some insurance.

1114
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,885
Did Mink have a .22?

1115
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:01,981
-He already ditched it. Why?
- After he shot Rug?

1116
01:31:02,058 --> 01:31:05,221
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter.

1117
01:31:05,295 --> 01:31:10,029
I've been thinking about our deal.
You can stick it in your ear.

1118
01:31:10,101 --> 01:31:13,538
You don't have anything on me that I don't
 have on you, so I'm calling your bluff.

1119
01:31:13,605 --> 01:31:15,869
- Wait a minute.
- I'm pulling out tomorrow morning.

1120
01:31:15,941 --> 01:31:19,571
You only have to decide whether or not
 I leave behind a message for Caspar...

1121
01:31:19,646 --> 01:31:21,580
that you're still around.

1122
01:31:21,648 --> 01:31:24,083
If you want me to keep my mouth shut,
 it's gonna cost you some dough.

1123
01:31:24,151 --> 01:31:26,711
I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable,
so I want two.

1124
01:31:26,787 --> 01:31:30,019
- In a pig's eye! - I'm going out.
I'll be back at 4:00 this morning.

1125
01:31:30,091 --> 01:31:33,027
If you're not here at my place, 4:00,
with the dough,

1126
01:31:33,095 --> 01:31:36,394
- Caspar's gonna be looking for you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1127
01:31:44,275 --> 01:31:47,733
- Got any money?
- No.

1128
01:31:49,114 --> 01:31:51,446
Okay.

1129
01:32:05,767 --> 01:32:07,701
Third race tonight.

1130
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:11,570
By the finish,
Tailor Made had a view of the field.

1131
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:14,133
You oughta lay off the ponies, Tom.

1132
01:32:20,752 --> 01:32:22,686
Okay.

1133
01:32:28,928 --> 01:32:32,490
Lazarre said he's sorry about this.
 It's just getting out of hand.

1134
01:32:32,566 --> 01:32:34,501
Yeah.

1135
01:32:34,569 --> 01:32:36,503
He likes you, Tom.

1136
01:32:36,571 --> 01:32:39,107
He said we didn't have to break anything.

1137
01:32:39,942 --> 01:32:42,103
It's okay.

1138
01:32:42,177 --> 01:32:44,771
Tell him there's no hard feelings. Heh!

1139
01:32:44,848 --> 01:32:49,012
Christ, Tom... he knows that.

1140
01:32:51,622 --> 01:32:53,783
Take care now.

1141
01:33:08,108 --> 01:33:10,076
- Tom Reagan.
- Yes, sir.

1142
01:33:10,144 --> 01:33:13,740
- Mr. Caspar's in the great room.
- Swell. Can you hold these?

1143
01:33:15,283 --> 01:33:17,309
Kid, what's the rumpus?

1144
01:33:17,386 --> 01:33:19,320
I got news.

1145
01:33:19,388 --> 01:33:22,552
Yeah. News at this end too.

1146
01:33:22,626 --> 01:33:25,060
My stomach's been seizing up on me.

1147
01:33:25,128 --> 01:33:27,825
- Mink just told me that he--
- Eh?

1148
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:31,426
- You talked to Mink?
- Yeah, on the phone.

1149
01:33:31,503 --> 01:33:34,631
The Dane wants you to think that he's
 disappeared so you can't talk to him,

1150
01:33:34,706 --> 01:33:37,767
- but he's been here in town.
- You sure it was Mink?

1151
01:33:37,844 --> 01:33:41,678
Yeah. See for yourself.
He's coming to my place, 4:00 this morning.

1152
01:33:41,748 --> 01:33:45,549
He's afraid of a crossing with Dane.
 He told me about the fix.

1153
01:33:45,619 --> 01:33:49,021
He says he'll sing for a couple of grand
 skip money, tell us everyone involved.

1154
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,524
But you'd better take care of the Dane tonight.

1155
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:54,461
Mink says he's coming after us tonight.

1156
01:34:00,437 --> 01:34:02,998
Leo's holed up at Whiskey Nick's dump.

1157
01:34:03,074 --> 01:34:05,008
What? How do you know?

1158
01:34:05,076 --> 01:34:08,205
That ain't all we know, smart guy.

1159
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:12,580
Recognize your playmate?

1160
01:34:16,656 --> 01:34:19,490
You thought I'd quit, huh? Uh-uh.

1161
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,495
I followed you this afternoon,

1162
01:34:22,563 --> 01:34:26,193
and I wondered why Einstein
would wanna talk to a gorilla.

1163
01:34:26,268 --> 01:34:29,796
So I grabbed the gorilla,
 and I beat it out of him.

1164
01:34:29,872 --> 01:34:33,467
You give me a big guy every time.
They break easy. Not like you.

1165
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:36,980
Is there a point, or are you just brushing up
on your small talk?

1166
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:40,540
I like that. Cool under fire.

1167
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,588
I'm impressed.

1168
01:34:45,258 --> 01:34:48,921
The gorilla didn't know whose stiff
we found, but I can fill that in.

1169
01:34:48,995 --> 01:34:51,988
You killed Mink, you son of a bitch!

1170
01:34:53,267 --> 01:34:56,669
It was Mink, you son of a bitch.

1171
01:34:56,738 --> 01:35:01,608
It was Mink, and by God, I'll hear you say it.

1172
01:35:01,677 --> 01:35:04,111
Is this how you told Drop his story?

1173
01:35:06,383 --> 01:35:08,681
Come here, bum.

1174
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:15,620
I am gonna send you to a deep, dark place,

1175
01:35:15,694 --> 01:35:18,492
and I am gonna have fun doing it.

1176
01:35:34,949 --> 01:35:36,918
Oof.

1177
01:35:36,986 --> 01:35:42,254
You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
You lousy son of a bitch!

1178
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:46,092
If there's one thing I can't stand,
 it's a double-cross artist!

1179
01:35:48,566 --> 01:35:51,593
I had a theory about this son of a bitch!

1180
01:35:55,941 --> 01:36:00,845
Shut up, you lousy son of a bitch,
or I'll give you something to holler about!

1181
01:36:00,914 --> 01:36:04,043
Johnny, it's okay. The Dane made him do it.
 It's not important.

1182
01:36:04,118 --> 01:36:07,680
Then make him shut it!

1183
01:36:07,756 --> 01:36:11,624
And we do the same to Mink
 this very same night!

1184
01:36:11,693 --> 01:36:14,629
We can't double-cross Mink.
He wants to spill the whole setup.

1185
01:36:14,697 --> 01:36:18,327
- I've never let a son of a bitch walk.
- You've never crossed anyone.

1186
01:36:18,402 --> 01:36:21,929
4:00, my place. Mink's coming in on
 his own hook, so I promised him the money.

1187
01:36:22,005 --> 01:36:27,273
- Don't make me out to be a liar.

1188
01:36:29,782 --> 01:36:32,307
Look at this, kid.

1189
01:36:33,987 --> 01:36:36,922
Something I try to teach all my boys.

1190
01:36:46,502 --> 01:36:49,438
Always put one in the brain.

1191
01:37:11,398 --> 01:37:13,332
What's the rumpus?

1192
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:16,928
I was just in the neighborhood
 feeling a little daffy.

1193
01:37:17,005 --> 01:37:19,303
- What are you doing?
- Walking.

1194
01:37:19,374 --> 01:37:21,639
Don't let on more than you have to.

1195
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,644
In the rain.

1196
01:37:28,318 --> 01:37:30,253
Bernie's dead, isn't he?

1197
01:37:31,556 --> 01:37:34,650
- What makes you think that?
- That's no answer.

1198
01:37:39,398 --> 01:37:42,061
I can't tell you
anything yet.

1199
01:37:42,135 --> 01:37:45,070
No one really cares, do they?

1200
01:37:45,138 --> 01:37:50,270
- His friends didn't really like him.
 - He didn't like his friends.

1201
01:37:50,344 --> 01:37:53,576
You're someone to talk.
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

1202
01:37:53,648 --> 01:37:56,584
You got me to tell you where he was,
and then you killed him.

1203
01:37:57,854 --> 01:37:59,879
I want to know why.

1204
01:37:59,956 --> 01:38:03,723
- What was in it for you?
- Nothing for me.

1205
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:11,864
Giving up Bernie was the only way I could see
 to straighten things out for Leo.

1206
01:38:13,906 --> 01:38:16,842
I thought you said you didn't care about Leo.

1207
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:20,573
I said we were through. It's not the same thing.

1208
01:38:20,647 --> 01:38:23,208
I don't understand. I don't care.

1209
01:38:23,284 --> 01:38:26,583
I don't care what reasons you had
 or you thought you had.

1210
01:38:26,654 --> 01:38:29,180
He's still alive.

1211
01:38:31,326 --> 01:38:33,420
You expect me to believe you?

1212
01:38:38,702 --> 01:38:40,636
No.

1213
01:38:43,942 --> 01:38:47,036
That's you all over, Tom.

1214
01:38:47,112 --> 01:38:49,547
A lie and no heart.

1215
01:39:07,536 --> 01:39:09,471
Oh--

1216
01:39:16,948 --> 01:39:19,042
It isn't easy, is it, Verna?

1217
01:39:34,736 --> 01:39:38,638
you even think about doing that,
 you gotta towel down.

1218
01:39:38,707 --> 01:39:44,169
So you towel down first with a hot towel,
 as hot as you can stand.

1219
01:39:44,246 --> 01:39:46,807
Put the razor in cold water, not hot,

1220
01:39:46,883 --> 01:39:49,613
because metal does what in cold?

1221
01:39:49,686 --> 01:39:54,056
- I don't know,Johnny.
 - That's why I'm telling you! It contracts.

1222
01:39:56,328 --> 01:40:00,196
That way you get
a first-class shave every time.

1223
01:40:00,265 --> 01:40:02,200
Okay,Johnny.

1224
01:40:04,838 --> 01:40:06,932
Ain't it the life though?

1225
01:40:10,544 --> 01:40:14,106
Hello, Sal. You can dangle.

1226
01:40:14,182 --> 01:40:18,988
Hello, Tom. You sure?
You don't look so hot.

1227
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:20,952
I'm okay.

1228
01:40:23,593 --> 01:40:25,823
I'll drive him home.

1229
01:41:18,359 --> 01:41:21,192
Mr. Reagan, there were shots.

1230
01:41:21,262 --> 01:41:24,198
Go down to the drug store and call the police.

1231
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:28,769
You'd better stay there
 till the officers arrive.

1232
01:41:29,839 --> 01:41:31,898
Will my cats be all right?

1233
01:41:31,974 --> 01:41:34,034
Yeah, they'll be fine.

1234
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:28,832
I get it. You set me up.

1235
01:42:28,909 --> 01:42:31,936
Anything to avoid a little
 dirty work yourself, huh?

1236
01:42:34,015 --> 01:42:37,349
How'd you know he'd get it and not me?
 Or didn't you care?

1237
01:42:37,419 --> 01:42:39,910
I figured you'd come early looking for blood.

1238
01:42:39,989 --> 01:42:42,925
He wouldn't,
so you'd likely have the drop on him.

1239
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:48,760
You're right.
The chump never knew what hit him.

1240
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:52,292
But if you knew I'd come to kill you,
 how do you know I won't still?

1241
01:42:52,371 --> 01:42:55,363
There's nothing in it for you now.

1242
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,376
With him dead, you and me
got nothing on each other.

1243
01:42:59,345 --> 01:43:01,871
- Let me have the gun.
- Why?

1244
01:43:01,949 --> 01:43:04,383
Pin this on the Dane.

1245
01:43:04,451 --> 01:43:07,444
Neither of us want him
walking around after this.

1246
01:43:07,522 --> 01:43:11,288
The cops'll be Leo's now. They won't care
 what they hang the Dane for.

1247
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:13,294
I guess that's true,

1248
01:43:13,362 --> 01:43:17,732
if you don't mind keeping the gun
 that killed Caspar and Mink.

1249
01:43:18,835 --> 01:43:21,235
Why did Mink shoot Rug anyway?

1250
01:43:21,305 --> 01:43:23,297
I don't know.
It was just a mix-up.

1251
01:43:23,374 --> 01:43:25,842
Here.

1252
01:43:28,614 --> 01:43:32,380
- So you're gonna say the Dane did this?
 - Sure.

1253
01:43:32,451 --> 01:43:35,250
Mink thought Rug was tailing him.

1254
01:43:35,322 --> 01:43:37,882
You know Mink. Hysterical.
Skin full of hop, head full of boogeymen.

1255
01:43:37,958 --> 01:43:42,521
Comes home crying one day,
 saying he had to pop one of the Dane's spies.

1256
01:43:42,597 --> 01:43:46,193
Rug was tailing Verna, not Mink.
Mink just happened to be with her.

1257
01:43:46,268 --> 01:43:48,202
Funny, ain't it?

1258
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:51,502
Mink was terrified the Dane'd find out
 me and him were jungled up together.

1259
01:43:51,574 --> 01:43:54,567
I bet you kept him worried about that
 to keep him under your thumb.

1260
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:57,079
Yeah, so what?
Scratch, huh?

1261
01:43:57,147 --> 01:43:59,776
A little bonus.

1262
01:43:59,851 --> 01:44:03,252
- Why did Mink take Rug's hair?
 - Beats me. The kid was dizzy.

1263
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:07,520
Fifty-fifty on the dough? Or maybe
 I should get more, since I did the deed.

1264
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:11,931
Okay, you keep it.
 I want you to have it.

1265
01:44:18,966 --> 01:44:23,234
Bernie...
we can't pin this on the Dane.

1266
01:44:24,076 --> 01:44:25,019
 Why not?

1267
01:44:26,002 --> 01:44:29,062
 Because the Dane's already dead
halfway across town.

1268
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,859
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Eddie Dane is dead.

1269
01:44:33,256 --> 01:44:34,438
It's gotta be you.

1270
01:44:36,597 --> 01:44:38,420
I mean, it was your gun.

1271
01:44:40,718 --> 01:44:44,625
What is this?
What the hell are you talking about?

1272
01:44:46,173 --> 01:44:47,173
You--

1273
01:44:48,476 --> 01:44:51,440
You took my gun.
It's just your word against mine.

1274
01:44:55,139 --> 01:44:56,513
Not necessarily.

1275
01:44:58,554 --> 01:45:00,094
Are you crazy?

1276
01:45:00,314 --> 01:45:03,659
We're square. You said it yourself.
We got nothing on each other.

1277
01:45:04,561 --> 01:45:05,561
Yep.

1278
01:45:06,998 --> 01:45:10,245
So what's in it for you?
There's no angle.

1279
01:45:10,345 --> 01:45:12,986
You can't just shoot me like that.

1280
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:20,861
Jesus Christ... it don't make sense.

1281
01:45:23,584 --> 01:45:25,518
Tommy--

1282
01:45:27,389 --> 01:45:29,217
Tommy!

1283
01:45:31,727 --> 01:45:32,912
Look in your heart.

1284
01:45:35,524 --> 01:45:37,790
- Look in your heart.
- What heart?

1285
01:46:24,022 --> 01:46:26,116
Tad? It's Tom.

1286
01:46:27,093 --> 01:46:28,679
Tell Lazarre I got his money.

1287
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,518
Yeah, all of it.

1288
01:46:32,249 --> 01:46:34,434
I wanna place a bet on tonight's fight.

1289
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,297
- They set you up downstairs?
- How's that?

1290
01:46:41,366 --> 01:46:42,822
A little hooch, whatever?

1291
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:46,997
Thanks for coming, Tom.
 Leo's real anxious to see you.

1292
01:46:47,066 --> 01:46:49,168
Yeah, I happened to be near.

1293
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:54,735
Well, uh,
actually this might not be  the best time.

1294
01:46:54,808 --> 01:46:57,756
- Who's he got in there?
- O'Doole and the mayor.

1295
01:46:58,358 --> 01:46:59,263
I'll try again.

1296
01:46:59,263 --> 01:47:01,558
They're planting the sheeny tomorrow.
You could stop by.

1297
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:34,067
- Big turnout.
- Drop dead.

1298
01:47:35,596 --> 01:47:37,698
She's under a lot of strain.

1299
01:47:37,775 --> 01:47:40,048
Yeah, well...
at least she didn't hit me.

1300
01:47:42,543 --> 01:47:44,144
Glad you came, Tommy.

1301
01:47:44,813 --> 01:47:47,308
- I guess, uh-- Huh?
- She's taking the car.

1302
01:47:53,126 --> 01:47:55,693
- I guess we're walkin'.
- Guess we are.

1303
01:48:01,296 --> 01:48:03,163
We're, uh--
We're getting married.

1304
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:07,749
Congratulations.

1305
01:48:08,756 --> 01:48:13,768
Funny thing is, she asked me to tie the knot.
I guess you're not supposed to say that.

1306
01:48:13,868 --> 01:48:16,077
- It doesn't matter. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1307
01:48:18,464 --> 01:48:21,048
Hell, Tom, why didn't you tell me
 what you were up to?

1308
01:48:21,148 --> 01:48:22,787
I thought you'd really gone over.

1309
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:26,202
Not that I didn't deserve it,
but you could've told me.

1310
01:48:27,512 --> 01:48:29,629
Telling you would only
have queered things if it--

1311
01:48:31,161 --> 01:48:32,611
There just wasn't any point.

1312
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:35,709
I can see that.

1313
01:48:37,419 --> 01:48:39,274
It was a smart play all around.

1314
01:48:40,742 --> 01:48:43,600
I guess... you know I'm grateful.

1315
01:48:43,727 --> 01:48:44,956
No need.

1316
01:48:47,957 --> 01:48:50,344
Heh! I guess you picked that fight with me...

1317
01:48:50,444 --> 01:48:53,260
just to check yourself in with Caspar.

1318
01:48:53,688 --> 01:48:57,191
I don't know. Do you always
 know why you do things, Leo?

1319
01:48:57,547 --> 01:48:58,901
Sure I do.

1320
01:49:01,839 --> 01:49:04,189
- It was a smart play.
- Fine.

1321
01:49:07,709 --> 01:49:10,766
Jesus, Tom, I'd do anything
 if you'd work for me again.

1322
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:14,526
I know I've made some bonehead plays,
 I know I can be pigheaded sometimes.

1323
01:49:14,669 --> 01:49:16,084
But, damn it, so can you.

1324
01:49:17,601 --> 01:49:20,985
I need you.
Things can be the way they were.

1325
01:49:21,973 --> 01:49:23,802
I know it. I just know it.

1326
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:28,783
As for you and Verna,
well... I understand.

1327
01:49:28,883 --> 01:49:30,086
You're both young.

1328
01:49:32,493 --> 01:49:34,058
Damn it, Tom, I forgive you.

1329
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:36,222
I didn't ask for that, and I don't want it.

1330
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:44,956
Good-bye, Leo.
