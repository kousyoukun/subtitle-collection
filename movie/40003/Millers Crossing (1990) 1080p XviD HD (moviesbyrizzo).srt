1
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,776
CASPAR:
I'm talking about friendship.

2
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:31,448
I'm talking about character.
I'm talking about...

3
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:37,245
Hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed to use
the word. I'm talking about ethics.

4
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,000
You know I'm a sporting man.
I like to lay the occasional bet.

5
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,461
But I ain't that sporting.

6
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:49,591
When I fix a fight, say I pay
a 3-to-1 favorite to throw a fight,

7
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:53,762
l got the right to expect
that fight to go off at 3-to-1.

8
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:57,891
But when I bet with this
son of a bitch Bernie Bernbaum,

9
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,936
before I know it, the odds even up.

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,024
Or, I'm betting on the short money.
The sheeny knows I like sure things.

11
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,569
He's selling the information
l fixed the fight.

12
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:14,032
Out-of-town money pours in.
The odds go straight to hell.

13
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:19,621
I don't know who he's selling to,
maybe the Los Angeles combine.

14
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:24,251
Bernie ain't satisfied with the honest
dollar he can make off the vig,

15
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:30,257
or the business I do on his book.
He is selling tips on how I bet.

16
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:35,720
So part of the payoff that should ride
on my hip rides on someone else's.

17
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,306
So back we go to these questions.

18
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:39,808
Friendship.

19
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,185
Character.

20
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,229
Ethics.

21
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,859
So it's clear what I'm saying?

22
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,989
As mud.

23
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,455
It's getting so a businessman can't
expect no return from a fixed fight.

24
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,001
Now if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

25
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,296
For a good return,
you gotta bet on chance.

26
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,550
Then you're back with anarchy.
Right back in the jungle.

27
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:19,097
That's why ethics is important.
What separates us from the animals,

28
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:23,393
the beasts of burden,
beasts of prey, ethics.

29
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:29,482
Whereas Bernie Bernbaum is a horse
of a different color, ethics-wise.

30
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,609
As in, he ain't got any.

31
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,739
- You sure it's Bernie selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

32
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:39,576
- No one else knows about the fix?
- No one without ethics.

33
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,166
LEO: What about the fighters that tank out?
-We only pick those we can threaten.

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,169
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

35
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:54,215
- I sometimes bet with Mink Larouie.
- It ain't Mink.

36
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,386
LEO: How do you know?
-It ain't Mink. He's Eddie Dane's boy.

37
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,307
Of course. The Dane
always knows about the fix.

38
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,601
What the hell does that mean?

39
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,104
Let it drift.
It means a lot of people know.

40
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:12,901
I guess you ain't been listening.
Sure, other people know.

41
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,240
That's why we question character to
determine who's chiseling in on my fix.

42
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:23,244
And that's how we know it's
Bernie Bernbaum, the Shmatte Kid.

43
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,331
Because ethically, he's kind of shaky.

44
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,417
So you wanna kill him.

45
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,669
For starters.

46
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:50,647
Sorry, Caspar.
Bernie pays for protection.

47
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:57,070
Leo, I ain't asking for permission.
I'm telling you as a courtesy.

48
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:01,533
- It's gonna get done.
- You'll have trouble.

49
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,495
You came to see if I'd kick if you
killed Bernie. There's your answer.

50
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,457
I pay off to you every month
like a greengrocer,

51
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:13,128
more than the Shmatte,
and I'm getting the high-hat!

52
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,423
LEO: You pay off for protection,
like everyone else.

53
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:21,261
Far as I know, the cops
haven't closed your dives,

54
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,972
and the DA hasn't touched
any of your rackets.

55
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:28,560
You haven't bought a license
to kill bookies. I ain't selling any.

56
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,563
So take your flunky and dangle.

57
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,109
I'm not some guinea
fresh off the boat you can kick.

58
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,196
I'm too big now.
I'm sick of taking the strap from you.

59
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,617
I'm sick of marching in here
to kiss your Irish ass!

60
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,871
And I'm sick of the high-hat!

61
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,931
You's fancy-pants, all of youse.

62
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:14,939
Johnny, you're exactly as big
as I let you be and no bigger,

63
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,317
and don't forget it. Ever.

64
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:23,990
That's right, Leo.
You're the big shot around here.

65
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,620
And I'm just some schnook
likes to get slapped around.

66
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:39,088
Twist a pig's ear, watch him squeal.

67
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,097
Bad play, Leo.

68
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,684
- You got up the wrong side, huh?
- Same side as always.

69
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,896
That's what I mean.
Still owe Lazarre money?

70
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,566
- I could put it right for you.
- I don't need it.

71
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:04,405
You haven't played a winner in weeks.
People'll talk if he breaks your legs.

72
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,243
- People'll say I had it coming.
- They'll be right.

73
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,121
Call me a big-hearted slob,
but I'll square it.

74
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,708
I think I'll do that
this very same night.

75
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:20,547
Looking at you moping around
takes away my... What do you call it?

76
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,216
- Joy de veever?
- Joie de vivre.

77
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,845
- If you laugh at me, the hell with you.
- The hell with you.

78
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:33,643
I'll square myself with Lazarre.
That's why God invented cards.

79
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,856
- There's one thing you can do.
- Name it.

80
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:44,237
Think about what protecting Bernie gets
us and what offending Caspar loses us.

81
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,533
- You know I don't like to think.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,995
Well, think about
whether you should start.

83
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,352
TAD:
Wake up, Tommy.

84
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,853
I am awake.

85
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:45,483
TAD: Your eyes are shut.
-Who you gonna believe?

86
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,204
- How'd I do?
- What do you think?

87
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,625
You are a millionaire.
You gonna remember your friends?

88
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,922
- Where's me hat?
- You bet it, mug.

89
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:12,427
Good thing the game broke up
before you bet your trousers.

90
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,016
- Who made off with me hat?
- Verna. Verna and Mink.

91
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:22,645
- Who?
- Mink and Verna.

92
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,114
- Is Thunderclap running tonight?
- Thunderclap?

93
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:37,034
- Yeah.
- What's she leaving at?

94
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,787
3-to-1, more than likely.

95
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:44,417
Lay off, Tom. You shouldn't go
deeper in the hole.

96
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,297
Tell Lazarre I want 500 on the nose.

97
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,966
You would have it.

98
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,440
TOM:
I want me hat.

99
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,150
Is that all you came for?

100
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,780
Yeah. I want me hat.

101
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,990
It's mine. I won it.

102
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,410
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Drop dead.

103
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,128
TOM:
I need a drink.

104
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,423
Why didn't you say so?

105
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,406
[KNOCKING]

106
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,441
Hello, Tommy. Sorry about the hour.

107
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,236
I'll live. What's the rumpus?

108
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,321
Can I come in?

109
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,449
Sure.

110
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,796
TOM: Drink?
LEO: I wouldn't mind.

111
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:04,265
- I tried calling earlier.
- I got home late.

112
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:14,984
- Well, I'm sorry about the hour.
- Uh-huh.

113
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,624
Not bad.

114
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:34,211
- Better than the paint we sell.
- That it is. That it is.

115
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:42,386
- You thought about cutting Bernie loose?
- Can't do it, Tommy.

116
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,973
That's sort of why I'm...

117
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:52,063
- Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.
- Uh-huh.

118
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,065
I know you're thinking,
"What's new?"

119
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:59,779
- But the situation now, I'm worried.
- She can take care of herself.

120
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,365
- Maybe better than you can.
- What does that mean?

121
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,825
Want another one?

122
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,786
LEO:
No.

123
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,955
What does that mean?

124
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:14,543
- How far has she got her hooks into you?
- That's a hell of a question.

125
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:21,717
It's a grift. If she didn't need you
to protect her brother from Caspar,

126
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,346
you think she'd take
slow carriage rides with you?

127
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,934
That's the deal, isn't it? You protect
Bernie till Caspar cools down?

128
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,769
You're a prickly pear.

129
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:35,940
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing. I don't blame her.

130
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:41,237
She sees the angle, you, she plays it.
She's a grifter, just like her brother.

131
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:46,242
From grifter parents and grandparents.
They'll spawn grifter kids.

132
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:50,204
Stop it. I don't like to hear
my friends run down.

133
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:55,251
- Friendship has nothing to do with it.
- You'd do anything to help friends.

134
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,838
Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.

135
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,925
You know all the angles.
Christ, better than anybody.

136
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,346
Maybe you're wrong about this.
You don't know what's in her heart.

137
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:14,061
If she's such an angel, why are you
looking for her at 4:00 a.m.?

138
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,444
- I put a tail on her this afternoon.
- Uh-huh.

139
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,989
I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around.

140
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,035
To keep her out of trouble.
Wasn't to spy.

141
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,455
I was worried. With Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

142
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,832
What did Rug say?

143
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,127
That's just it. Nothing.
He's disappeared.

144
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,714
So you've lost your lady friend
and her tail?

145
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,300
I guess it sounds pretty sorry.

146
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,678
Help me out.
I don't know where to look.

147
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,389
You know Rug's crowd and Verna's.

148
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:54,060
I'm worried, with the way things are
with Caspar.

149
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:59,899
You shouldn't be confronting Caspar.
You can't trade body blows with him.

150
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:04,111
I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

Except you, Tom.

And Verna.

Okay, give me the needle.

154
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,595
I am a sap.

155
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,181
I deserve it.

00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,352
Thanks for the drink.

157
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,439
Let me know if you hear anything.

158
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,136
Who was that?

159
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,971
Leo.

160
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,181
He's looking for you.

161
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,809
Did you tell him I was here?

162
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,686
No.

163
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,151
Did you put in a good word
for my brother?

164
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,361
No.

165
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,740
- You said you would.
- I said I'd think about it.

166
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,035
What did you tell him?

167
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,043
- Did you see Rug Daniels last night?
- No.

168
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,337
What did you tell Leo?

169
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:49,300
I told him you were a tramp
and he should dump you.

170
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,014
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

- Mink.

- You got your hat back.
- What of it?

173
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,262
Nothing. It ain't my business.
Bernie wants to see you.

174
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:20,057
- I'm not made of glass.
- He's nervous in public.

175
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,477
He's nervous.
In the spot he's in, who wouldn't be?

176
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,855
He wants you to ask Leo to watch him.
Leo listens to you.

177
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,776
Not that Leo wouldn't help
the Shmatte anyway.

178
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,487
- I don't get it.
- What's to get?

179
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,700
- You're Dane's sycophant.
- I can have more than one friend.

180
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,328
I don't want Dane to know,
but a guy like Bernie?

181
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,081
For a sheeny, he has good qualities.

182
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,750
What's going on with you and Bernie?

183
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,545
Nothing. We're friends.
You know, amigos.

184
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,922
You're a fickle boy, Mink.

185
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,135
If Eddie Dane finds out
you got another amigo,

186
00:18:56,219 --> 00:19:00,848
- I doubt he's the understanding type.
- How's he gonna find out?

Hello, Tommy.

190
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,151
You know O'Doole and the mayor.

191
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:16,155
I ought to. I voted for him
six times last May.

192
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,116
And that ain't the record either.

193
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:24,330
Verna turned up. She's downstairs.

194
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,875
- She say where she been?
- No. I didn't press her.

- You hear about Rug?
- Yeah, R.l.P.

00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:38,218
They took his hair. Jesus, that's
strange. Why would they do that?

197
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,763
Maybe it was Injuns.

So you figure Caspar bumped Rug?

201
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:54,276
- It's pretty obvious, ain't it?
- Yeah? So, what's the plan?

202
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:59,073
Jump on the guinea with both feet.
Give him the lowdown.

203
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:05,829
Leo just reminded us that Mr. Caspar
operates several clubs in our city,

204
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:10,125
wherein the patrons imbibe rum
and play games of chance.

205

- We're to stop the party.
- They don't look happy about it.

- It ain't that.
- We do as we're told.

207

Stirring this up won't be good
for anyone. It'll mean killing.

-I can't just lay down to Caspar.
TOM: You could do worse.

Bernie is a small price
to pay for peace.

210
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,731
It's business.
A war will hurt everybody.

211
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,860
Bernie plays with fire,
he must deal with the consequences.

That ain't even the point anymore.

213
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,908
He pooped Rug.
The day I back down,

214
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,412
Caspar's welcome to this town
and my place.

215
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,957
- I didn't start this...
- You did. You and Verna.

Caspar hasn't broken the rules.
Bernie and you have.

218
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,427
If you call a war,
you have more to lose than Caspar.

219
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:06,432
But more to beat him with!
We have faced worse odds!

220
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:10,018
Never without reason.
It helps to have one.

221
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:22,364
It's your call. My opinion used
to count for something around here.

- In the ladies' room.

- He won't like that.

- Couldn't you get it from Leo?
- It's not Leo's debt.

- I admire a man of principle.

Does this go on the tab?

- Afraid people may get the right idea?

00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:33,352
Leo has the right idea. I like him.
He's honest and has a heart.

- He used to be.

00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,001
You want me to pretend I don't care
what happens to Bernie?

He's my brother.
I don't want him to get hurt.

If Leo wants to help, I'll show him
a good time. There's no harm.

- Sneer at him like everyone else.

Just because he's different,
people think he's a degenerate, scum.

Why don't you just say so?

- I forgot. That's your job, right?

00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:49,428
I'll do what I must to protect Leo.
I'm asking you to leave him alone.

- Right.

602
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:35,981
I know you knew protecting
the Shmatte was dumb.

603
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:39,776
I know you've been wise
to all of Leo's dumb ideas.

604
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:45,157
Only a matter of time. That's why we
didn't put the arm on you, only Leo.

605
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:48,743
Since you botched that hit,
l can only be so grateful.

606
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:51,830
That's brave,
little Miss Punching Bag.

- Okay, Eddie. Friends now, huh?
- Nuts.

- I guess you'll be looking for a job?
- I might be.

609
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,968
Got references?
Been to college?

610
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:10,098
We only take yeggs what's been
to college. Ain't that right, Dane?

611
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:16,897
I'm joking, of course. We know you can
be useful to us, a smart kid like you.

612
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:22,402
The man who walks behind the man and
whispers in his ear could be useful.

613
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,031
I can do plenty for you.
Can you get Leo off me?

614
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:30,744
Don't worry about Leo,
we got plans for him.

615
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,830
- Like what?
- Not so fast, Kaputnik.

616
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:38,460
He's trying to say there will
be time to talk about that.

617
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:42,172
We can table that for a later day.

618
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:46,968
See, the last time we jawed,
you gave me the high-hat.

619
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:54,142
I guess I'm saying you gotta put
something on the table first. Ante up.

620
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,896
- Where do we start?
- Hear that? All business.

621
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,733
I told you he was a good kid.
All business.

622
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:05,946
We could start with the Shmatte.
Where's the Shmatte?

623
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,407
- You could tell us that.
- The Royale, room 302.

624
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:13,078
-You might find Mink with him.
DANE: The hell you say.

625
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:17,707
Bernie and Mink are cozy as lice.
And it ain't just business.

626

- Why would l?

This guy is all wrong.

628
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,840
Mink is clean and this clown
is a smart guy!

629
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,971
It's easy enough to find out, eh?

630
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:36,893
You find Mink,
you bring him back here.

631
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:41,106
You go with Frankie
and Tic-Tac to the Royale.

632

If Bernie's there, Frankie and Tic-Tac
will take care of him.

00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:48,363
And if he's not there?

634
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:52,158
I'll sit facing the corner
in a funny hat.

- The boss wants you to do it.

You know how to do this?

then you put one in his brain.

Dane's making excuses for him,

but I think you was right.
Mink and Bernie was in it together.

I think Mink heard that you bumped the
Shmatte and lit out. Son of a bitch!

01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:40,543
- I told you so.

You was a good sport
to bump the Shmatte.

723
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:59,395
- How do you know Mink skipped?
- Dane can't find him.

724
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,774
- So he says.
- Meaning what, exactly?

725
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:05,860
I didn't give it much thought
until now,

726
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:09,655
since a guy will say anything
when his number's up.

727
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:14,577
But before I bumped Bernie, he swore
that Dane and Mink set him up.

728
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:18,372
That they were the ones
who sold out your fix.

729
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,510
Well, like you say,
a guy will say anything.

730
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:34,347
So why isn't Eddie Dane here?

731
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:41,395
Well, he don't care for you, kid.
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

732
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,024
After you left,
he tried to sell me on a double-cross.

733
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:49,946
He says why don't we give you
the bump after we get the Shmatte?

734
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,991
But I figure a deal is a deal.
You're square with me,

735
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:57,453
you bump the Shmatte,
l hold up my end.

736
01:05:57,538 --> 01:06:00,498
It's ethics. Everything above-board,

737
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:04,418
so everybody knows who's a friend,
who's an enemy.

So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me. We go back.

she asked me to tie the knot.

1199
01:48:12,278 --> 01:48:17,991
- I guess I'm not supposed to say that.
- It doesn't matter. Congratulations.

1200
01:48:18,076 --> 01:48:23,455
Why didn't you say what you're up to?
I thought you'd really gone over.

1201
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:27,042
Not that I didn't deserve it,
but you could've told me.

1202
01:48:27,126 --> 01:48:30,712
Telling you would only have
queered things if...

1203
01:48:30,797 --> 01:48:33,799
There just wasn't any point.

1204
01:48:33,883 --> 01:48:37,052
Yeah, I can see that.

1205
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:40,222
It was a smart play all around.

1206
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:45,310
- I guess you know I'm grateful.
- No need.

1207
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:53,318
I guess you picked that fight with me
just to tuck yourself in with Caspar?

1208
01:48:53,403 --> 01:48:57,239
I don't know. Do you always know
why you do things?

1209
01:48:57,323 --> 01:48:59,282
Sure I do.

1210
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:05,038
- It was a smart play.
- Fine.

1211
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:10,877
I'd do anything
if you'd work for me again!

1212
01:49:10,962 --> 01:49:16,633
I know I can be pigheaded sometimes,
but damn it, so can you!

1213
01:49:17,135 --> 01:49:21,555
I need you.
Things can be the way they were.

1214
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:23,974
I know it. I just know it.

1215
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:31,148
As for you and Verna, well,
l understand. You're both young.

1216
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,900
Damn it, I forgive you.

1217
01:49:33,985 --> 01:49:37,571
I didn't ask for that,
and I don't want it.

1218
01:49:43,661 --> 01:49:46,079
Goodbye, Leo.
