1
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,683
I'm talkin'about friendship.

2
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,183
I'm talkin'about character.

3
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:33,683
I'm talkin'about--
Hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed
to use the word.

4
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:36,883
I'm talkin' about ethics.

5
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:39,183
You know I'm a sportin' man.

6
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:41,683
I like to lay the occasional bet.

7
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:44,283
But I ain't that sportin'.

8
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:47,283
When I fix a fight--
Say I pay a three to one favorite...

9
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:49,383
to throw a goddamned fight.

10
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,483
I figure I got the right
to expect that fight
to go off at three to one.

11
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:57,283
But every time I lay in bed
with this son of a bitch
Bernie Bernbaum,

12
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,683
before I know it,
the odds is even up.

13
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:03,383
Or worse, I'm bettin'
on the short money.

14
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,683
The sheeny knows
I like sure things.

15
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:09,183
He's sellin' the information
I fixed the fight.

16
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:11,683
Out of town money
comes pouring in.

17
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,983
The odds go straight to hell.

18
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:17,383
I don't know who
he's sellin' to-- maybe
the Los Angeles combine.

19
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:19,383
I don't know. The point is,

20
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:23,583
Bernie ain't satisfied
with the honest dollar
he can make off the vig.

21
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,883
He ain't satisfied with
the business I do on his book.

22
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,883
He is sellin' tips on how I bet.

23
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,183
And that means part
of the payoff that should
be riding on my hip...

24
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:35,383
is riding on someone else's.

25
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,983
So, back we go
to these questions--

26
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:41,883
friendship, character,

27
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:44,383
ethics.

28
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,583
So, it's clear what I'm saying?

29
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,783
As mud.

30
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:02,083
It's gettin' so a businessman
can't expect no return
from a fixed fight.

31
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:05,683
Now, if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

32
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:09,083
For a good return,you gotta
go bettin'on chance,

33
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,483
and then you're
back with anarchy.

34
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:13,483
Right back in the jungle.

35
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:18,583
That's why ethics is important--
what separates us
from the animals,

36
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:21,183
the beasts of burden,
the beasts of prey.

37
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:23,283
Ethics.

38
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:27,383
Whereas, uh, Bernie Bernbaum
is a horse of a different color,

39
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,183
ethics-wise, as in
he ain't got any.

40
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:35,383
- You sure it's Bernie
selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

41
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:39,383
- No one else knows about the fix?
- No one that ain't got ethics.

42
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:42,383
What about the fighters
you pay to tank out?

43
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:46,483
We only pick fighters
we know we can put
the fear of God in.

44
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,883
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

45
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:52,083
I-I lay an occasional bet
with Mink Larouie.

46
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:54,783
- But it ain't Mink.
I'll vouch for that.
-How do you know?

47
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:58,083
It ain't Mink.
Mink is Eddie Dane's boy.

48
00:02:58,283 --> 00:03:01,983
Of course the Dane
always knows about the fix.

49
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,283
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

50
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:07,783
Let it drift. All it means is
a lot of people know.

51
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:10,283
I guess you ain't
been listenin'.

52
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:12,483
Sure, other people know.

53
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:15,283
That's why we gotta go
to this question of character...

54
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,983
to determine just who, exactly,
is chiselin' in on my fix.

55
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,883
And that's how we know
that it's Bernie Bernbaum,
the shmatte kid--

56
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,983
'cause ethically,
he's kinda shaky.

57
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:31,283
- So you want to kill him.
- For starters.

58
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:50,283
Sorry, Caspar.
Bernie pays for protection.

59
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,983
Listen, Leo, I ain't
askin' you for permission.

60
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:59,183
I'm tellin' you as a courtesy.
I need to do this thing,
so it's gonna get done.

61
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,283
And I'm tellin' you, as
a courtesy, you'll have trouble.

62
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:05,183
You came here to see if
I'd kick if you killed Bernie.
Well, there's your answer.

63
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:08,983
I pay off to you every month
like a greengrocer

64
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,983
a lot more than the shmatte,

65
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,083
and I'm sick of gettin'
the high hat.

66
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:16,083
You pay off for protection
just like everyone else.

67
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:18,983
As far as I know, and
what I don't know in this town
ain't worth knowing,

68
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:21,083
the cops haven't closed
any of your dives...

69
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:23,583
and the D.A. hasn't touched
any of your rackets.

70
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:26,183
You haven't bought any license
to kill bookies,

71
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:28,283
and today I ain't sellin'any.

72
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:31,283
So take your flunky and dangle.

73
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:35,683
You think I'm some guinea
fresh off the boat,
and you can kick me.

74
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:39,783
But I'm too big for that now.
I'm sick of takin'
the strap from you, Leo.

75
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,383
I'm sick of marching
into this goddamn office...

76
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,483
to kiss your Irish ass,

77
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,983
and I'm sick of the high hat!

78
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,883
You's fancy pants, all of youse.

79
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:11,283
Johnny?

80
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:14,683
You're exactly as big
as I let you be and no bigger,

81
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:16,983
and don't forget it, ever.

82
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,583
That's right, Leo.

83
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,683
You're the big shot
around here,

84
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:27,383
and I'm just some schnook
likes to get slapped around.

85
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:37,883
Twist a pig's ear,
watch him squeal.

86
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,983
- Bad play, Leo.
- Who got up the wrong side, huh?

87
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,983
-Same side as always.
- That's what I mean.
Still owe money to--

88
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,483
Who is your bookie, Lazarre?
I could put it right for you.

89
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:59,583
- Thanks, Leo. I don't need it.
- In a pig's eye.

90
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,683
You haven't played
a winner in six weeks.

91
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:04,083
People will speak ill of me
if I let him break your legs.

92
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:07,983
- People will say I had it coming.
-And they'll be right,
but that ain't the point.

93
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:11,883
Call me a bighearted slob,
but I'm gonna square it
for you, yeah.

94
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:15,483
I think I'll do that
this very same night.

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,383
Lookin' at you mopin' around
takes away all my--

96
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,083
What do you call it?
"Joy de veever"?

97
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,283
-Joie de vivre.
- Well, if you're gonna
laugh at me, the hell with ya.

98
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:27,883
The hell with you.

99
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:30,483
I'll square myself with Lazarre,
if you don't mind.

100
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:33,483
That's why God invented cards.

101
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,783
- There is one thing
you can do for me.
- Name it.

102
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,283
Think about what
protecting Bernie gets us.

103
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,983
Think about what
offending Caspar loses us.

104
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:46,383
Oh, come on, Tommy.
You know I don't like to think.

105
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,583
Yeah.

106
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,583
Well, think about
whether you should start.

107
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,383
Wake up, Tommy.

108
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,583
- I am awake.
- Your eyes are shut.

109
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:44,883
Who you gonna believe?

110
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:58,083
- How'd I do?
- What do you think?

111
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,883
You are a millionaire.
You gonna remember your friends?

112
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:07,983
- Where's me hat?
- You bet it, mug.

113
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,483
Good thing the game broke up
before you bet your trousers.

114
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:15,983
- Who made off with me hat?

115
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,983
Verna. Verna and Mink.

116
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,383
- Who?
- Mink and Verna.

117
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:31,483
Is Thunderclap running tonight?

118
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:34,783
Thunderclap?
Yeah.

119
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,983
What's she leaving at?

120
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,583
Three to one, more than likely.

121
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,983
Lay off, Tom. You shouldn't go
deeper in the hole.

122
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,583
Tell Lazarre...

123
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:49,083
I want 500 on the nose.

124
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,683
You would have it.

125
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,383
I want me hat.

126
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:11,183
Is that all you came for?

127
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:13,683
Yeah. I want me hat.

128
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:15,883
It's mine. I won it.

129
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,583
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Drop dead.

130
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:29,983
I need a drink.

131
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:32,683
Why didn't you say so?

132
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:32,183
Hello, Tommy.
Sorry about the hour.

133
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:36,083
- I'll live. What's the rumpus?
-Can I come in?

134
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:41,283
Sure.

135
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,983
- Drink?
- I wouldn't mind.

136
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:01,983
I tried callin' earlier.

137
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:04,683
I got home late.

138
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:15,283
- Well, uh, I'm sorry about the hour.
- Uh-huh.

139
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:31,283
- Not bad.
- Better than the paint
we sell at the club.

140
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,983
That it is. That it is.

141
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,783
- You thought about
cutting Bernie loose?
- Can't do it, Tommy.

142
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:42,783
Can't do it.

143
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,383
That's sort of why I'm, uh--

144
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,983
Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.

145
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:54,483
- Uh-huh.
- I know what you're thinkin',
what else is new?

146
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:57,483
But the situation now--
I'm worried.

147
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:00,983
Verna can take care of herself,
maybe better than you can.

148
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:04,683
- What does that mean?
- Want another one?

149
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:06,683
No.

150
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,883
What does that mean?

151
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,283
How far she got
her hooks into you?

152
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:13,483
That's a hell of a question.

153
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:17,883
It's a grift.

154
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,583
If she didn't need you
to protect her brother
from Johnny Caspar,

155
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:25,283
you think she'd still be going
on slow carriage rides with you
through the park?

156
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:29,783
That's the deal, isn't it?
You keep Bernie under wraps
till Caspar cools down?

157
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,783
Jesus, you're a prickly pear.
What's wrong with her wanting
her brother taken care of?

158
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:35,783
Nothing. I don't blame her.

159
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,183
She sees the angle,
which is you, she plays it.

160
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:41,183
She's a grifter,
just like her brother.

161
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:43,583
Probably had grifter parents
and grifter grandparents...

162
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:46,683
and someday they're each
gonna spawn little grifter kids.

163
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:49,983
Stop it, Tommy.
I don't like to hear my friends
run down, even by other friends.

164
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:52,283
- Friendship's got
nothing to do with it.
- The hell you say.

165
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:55,183
You'd do anything to help
your friends, like you'd do
anything to kick your enemies.

166
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:56,783
- Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

167
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:58,783
- Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

168
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,883
You know all the angles,
Christ, better than anybody.

169
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,183
But maybe you're wrong
about this. You don't know
what's in Verna's heart.

170
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:10,083
Leo, if she's such an angel,

171
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,383
why are you looking for her
at 4:00 in the morning?

172
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,783
I put a tail on her this afternoon.

173
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:24,683
- Uh-huh.
- I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around,

174
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:28,083
just, you know,
to keep her out of trouble.

175
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:32,283
I was worried.
After that meeting with Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

176
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:35,583
- So what did Rug say that has you
scurrying over here?
- That's just it.

177
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:41,283
- Nothing. He's disappeared.
- So you lost your lady friend
and the tail you put on her?

178
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,083
I guess it does sound
pretty sorry at that.

179
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,583
Help me out, Tom.
I wouldn't know where
to start lookin'.

180
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:50,283
You know Rug's crowd.
You know the people Verna runs with.

181
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:53,983
It's just I'm worried now
with things the way they are
between me and Caspar.

182
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,883
You shouldn't be confronting
Johnny Caspar. That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

183
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,783
You can't trade
body blows with him.
He's gotten too strong.

184
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:03,883
I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

185
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,683
Except you, Tom.

186
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,783
And Verna.

187
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:25,283
Okay. Give me the needle.

188
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:30,283
I am a sap.

189
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:33,683
I deserve it.

190
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,983
Thanks for the drink.

191
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,683
Let me know
if you hear anything.

192
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:11,783
- Who was that?
- Leo.

193
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,083
He's lookin' for you.

194
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,683
Did you tell him I was here?

195
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:19,183
No.

196
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:24,983
Did you put in a good word
for my brother?

197
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:27,283
No.

198
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:30,583
- You said you would.
- I said I'd think about it.

199
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,883
What did you tell him?

200
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:40,683
Did you see
Rug Daniels last night?

201
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:43,183
No.

202
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,283
What did you tell Leo?

203
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:48,083
I told him you were a tramp
and he should dump you.

204
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,883
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

205
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,183
- Hello, Tom.
What's the rumpus?
- Mink.

206
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,383
- I see you got your hat back.
- Yeah, what of it?

207
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:14,483
Not a thing. Look,
if it ain't my business,
I got not a thing to say.

208
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:16,583
Listen, Bernie wants to see you.
It's important.

209
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:18,583
Yeah, well, I'm right here.
I'm not made of glass.

210
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:21,283
He's nervous walkin' around
in public. He's a right guy,
but he's very nervous.

211
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:23,983
I mean, who wouldn't be?
In the spot he's in,
who wouldn't be?

212
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,383
He asked me to ask you
to ask Leo to take care of him.

213
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,483
Leo listens to you.
Not that Leo wouldn't help
a shmatte anyway.

214
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:30,883
A guy like Bernie?
A straight shooter like him?

215
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,683
- I don't get it, Mink.
- What's to get? It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

216
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:36,083
- I thought you were
Eddie Dane's sycophant.
- Yeah, Tom, that's right,

217
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,183
but a guy can have more
than one friend, can't he?

218
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,283
Not that I want the Dane to know
about it, but the shmatte,
he's a right guy, Tommy.

219
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,983
He's got a mixed reputation,
but for a sheeny, he's got
a lot of good qualities.

220
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:47,283
- What's goin' on
between you and Bernie?
- Nothin', Tom.

221
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:49,383
We're just...
friends, you know, amigos.

222
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,883
You're a fickle boy, Mink.

223
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:56,083
If Eddie Dane finds out
that you got another "amigo"--

224
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,883
- Well, I don't peg him
for the understanding type.
- Find out?

225
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,683
How's he gonna find out?
Damn it, you and me
ain't even been talkin'!

226
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:05,283
Jesus, Tom! Damn it!Jesus!

227
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:10,083
Hello, Tommy.

228
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:13,283
- You know O'Doole and the mayor?
-I oughta.

229
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:16,083
Voted for him six times last May.

230
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,183
And that ain't the record, either.

231
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:24,283
Oh, Verna turned up.
She's downstairs.

232
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,783
- She say where she'd been?
- No. I didn't want to press her.

233
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:32,183
- You hear about Rug?
- Yeah. R.I.P.

234
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:35,283
They took his hair, Tommy.

235
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:38,083
Jesus, that's strange.
Why would they do that?

236
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:42,583
- Maybe it was injuns.
- "Eye-ties," more like it.

237
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,783
Giovanni Gasparo.

238
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,683
So you figure Caspar bumped Rug.

239
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:52,383
- Well, it's pretty obvious, ain't it?
- Yeah?

240
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:57,383
- So what's the plan?
- Well, we'll jump on the guinea
hard with both feet.

241
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,983
- Give him the lowdown, Dale.
- Yes. Well, um,

242
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,883
Leo here just reminded us
that Mr. Caspar operates...

243
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,983
several clubs in our city,

244
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,983
wherein the patrons
imbibe of rum and play
at games of chance.

245
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:12,283
And we're supposed to
stop the party.

246
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:15,283
- They don't look
to happy about it, Leo.
- Oh, no, it ain't that, Tom.

247
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,583
-Jesus, Tom, we do as we're told.
- Maybe they're right
not to like it.

248
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:21,683
Stirring up this hornet's nest
won't be good for anyone,
and it'll mean killing.

249
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:24,883
I'm not thrilled
about it either, but I can't
just lay down to Caspar.

250
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,583
You could do worse.
You might not like it, but
giving up Bernie Bernbaum...

251
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,683
is a pretty small price
to pay for peace.

252
00:20:29,783 --> 00:20:32,783
Business is business,
and a war is going to hurt everybody.

253
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,183
Bernie plays with fire,
he's got to deal
with the consequences.

254
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:37,283
even if that means
he gets bumped off.

255
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:41,283
SweetJesus, Tom, that ain't
even the point anymore.
Caspar pooped Rug.

256
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:44,183
The day I back down
from a fight, Caspar's
welcome to the rackets,

257
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:46,383
this town and my place
at the table.

258
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,583
- I didn't start this thing, but--
- You did start it.

259
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:51,983
- You and Verna.
- We can dangle, Leo,
if you'd prefer.

260
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:54,183
Sit down, Dale!
We're all friends here.

261
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:57,683
And Caspar hasn't
broken the rules, Bernie has,
and you, too, by helping him.

262
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,983
And if that isn't enough,
consider that if you
make this a war,

263
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,183
you have more to lose than Caspar.

264
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:06,283
Okay, but more to beat him with.
Jesus, Tom, the two of us
have faced worse odds.

265
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,983
Never without reason.
It helps to have one.

266
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,283
Well, it's your call.

267
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,283
My opinion used to count
for something around here.

268
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:24,483
But it's always yours
to take or leave.

269
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,483
Come on, Tommy.
It's not like that.

270
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:31,083
Goddamn it!

271
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:36,183
Goddamn kid's just like a twist.

272
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:38,683
Get me a stiff one.

273
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,483
No small talk, huh?

274
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,983
- They shoot your horse?
- If there's any justice.

275
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,783
- Verna around?
- She stepped into
the ladies' room.

276
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,183
- You got Lazarre's 500?
- You'll have to carry me
for a few days.

277
00:21:55,383 --> 00:21:58,283
He ain't gonna like that.
Couldn't you get it from Leo?

278
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,683
It's not Leo's debt.
I'll pay me own way.

279
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:03,783
I admire a man of principle.

280
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,383
Does this go on the tab?

281
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,183
-
- Close your eyes, ladies.
I'm coming through.

282
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,983
- Who's the war paint for?
- Go home and dry out.

283
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,183
You don't need it for Leo,
believe me.

284
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,683
He already thinks you're
the original Miss Jesus.

285
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,883
- What the hel"s
the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

286
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,483
- Afraid people might get
the right idea?
- Leo's got the right idea.

287
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,283
I like him.
He's honest and he's got a heart.

288
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,683
Then it's true what they say--
opposites attract.

289
00:22:35,883 --> 00:22:39,183
- Do me a favor.
Mind your own business.
- This is my business.

290
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:42,083
Intimidating helpless women
is part of what I do.

291
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:44,383
- Then find one
and intimidate her.
-Leo's upstairs...

292
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:46,783
getting ready to shoot himself
in the foot on your account.

293
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:48,783
-I don't know
what you're talkin'about.
- He's gonna go to the mat...

294
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:50,783
for your brother,
and it's gonna hurt him.

295
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:53,083
I don't know Leo's business,
but he's a big boy.

296
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:55,183
- He used to be.
- Look, what do you want, Tom?

297
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:58,083
You want me to pretend
I don't care what happens to Bernie?

298
00:22:58,283 --> 00:23:00,883
Well, I do.
He's my brother. I don't
want to see him get hurt.

299
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:05,283
If Leo wants to help out,
I'll step out with him,
show him a good time in return.

300
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,783
- There's no harm in that.
- There's a name for that kind
of business arrangement.

301
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:12,383
Look, I'll do what I have to do
to protect Bernie.

302
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,883
There's no reason for you
to try and queer that.

303
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,583
Regardless of what
you think about me,
Bernie's a decent guy.

304
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:21,283
- A straight shooter, huh?
A square "G."
- Yeah.

305
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:25,483
Sneer at him like everyone else,
just because he's different.

306
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:28,283
People think he's a degenerate.
People think he's scum.

307
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:31,983
- Well, he's not.
-Poor misunderstood Bernie.

308
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,583
What is this about, Tom?

309
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:37,983
You want me to stop seeing Leo?
Why don't you just say so?

310
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:43,283
I want you to quit
spinning Leo in circles
and pointing him where to go.

311
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,883
- I forgot. That's your job.
- I'll do what I have to do
to protect Leo.

312
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,283
I'm asking you politely.
Leave him alone.
I don't have to ask.

313
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:52,583
If I told him about our little
dance last night, your pool
would pretty soon dry up.

314
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,683
So would yours.
I don't like being threatened.

315
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:58,883
I don't like being taken for
a sucker. That might work with
Leo, but it don't work with me.

316
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:02,283
Do you think last night
was just more campaigning
for my brother?

317
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,183
I can see the angles.

318
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:06,383
You know, if there was a market
for little old ladies,

319
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,483
you'd have Grandma Bernbaum
first in line.

320
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:11,283
- You're a pathetic rumhead.
- And I love you, angel.

321
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,783
I suppose you think
you raised hell.

322
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:38,383
Sister, when I've raised hell,
you'll know it.

323
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:18,583
- Yeah.
- Lazarre wants
his money. He wants it now.

324
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:21,283
- I need a couple of days.
- Yeah? How come is that?

325
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:25,483
- Because I don't have it.
- All right, welsher, how do I
know you ain't got it?

326
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:29,683
- Because I say so.
- That ain't gonna be good enough.

327
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:33,283
- What would be good enough?
- Lazarre ain't gonna
like it one bit.

328
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:36,383
Tell Lazarre if he's not happy,
he can send someone over
to break my legs.

329
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:39,383
I won't squawk.

330
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:43,783
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hello, Tom.

331
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:47,383
- What's the rumpus?
-Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

332
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:50,083
Yeah, you weren't here,
so I thought I'd do that.

333
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,483
I didn't want to answer
the phone, though. I figured...

334
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,483
it wasn't for me.

335
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:59,083
I get it. Get to the point, huh?

336
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,883
Okay. The point is,
I'm a good guy.

337
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:04,083
I've heard that
from a lot of people today.

338
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:06,083
Good guy, lots of friends.
That's the way it works.

339
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:10,583
Maybe if you appreciated me
a little more, you wouldn't
be making waves with Leo.

340
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:13,483
It's a bad time to be
doing that. Right now,
we're both in a jam.

341
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:17,183
I hear you're on a bad streak.
Short of funds.

342
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:20,683
Well, I got that crazy dago
mad at me.

343
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:22,683
Don't ask me why.
I'm just a small-timer...

344
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:25,083
trying to get by
like everyone else.

345
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,083
I need help from my friends
like Leo and you.

346
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,283
Leo gets your sister.
What are you sellin' me?

347
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:32,783
Come on, Tom.
It's not like that at all.
It wasn't my idea.

348
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:34,983
She'll sleep with anyone.
You know that.

349
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:38,583
She even tried to teach me
a thing or two about bed artistry.

350
00:26:38,883 --> 00:26:41,583
Can you believe that?

351
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,983
My own sister.

352
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:49,083
Some crackpot idea about
saving me from my friends.

353
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:51,383
She's a sick twist, all right.

354
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:55,183
- She speaks highly of you.
- Yeah, well, you stick
by your family.

355
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,883
The point is, I can help you
with your debts if that
would make us friends.

356
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,383
My motto is,
"A guy can't have too many."

357
00:27:01,483 --> 00:27:04,583
Big payday Saturday, Tom.
You could be in on it.

358
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:07,083
Another fix? Which fight?

359
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:11,183
That's confidential
at the moment. But it
doesn't have to stay that way.

360
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:13,583
How come you know
so much about it?

361
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:15,783
Caspar isn't laying
any more bets with you.

362
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:23,683
You really must have Mink
jumping through hoops.

363
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:26,983
Like I say, you can't
have too many.

364
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,383
- We got a deal?
- I'll think about it.

365
00:27:37,983 --> 00:27:40,183
I wouldn't want it any other way.

366
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,683
Hey, Adolph.

367
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:50,583
- My credit still
good with you?
- Mmm.

368
00:27:50,683 --> 00:27:53,283
Give me a hundred across on Tailor Made
in the third tonight.

369
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,783
- Lazarre won't like it.
- Try 50 across.

370
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:59,283
I'll try.
It's another 1 50 you'll owe him.

371
00:27:59,483 --> 00:28:02,783
- Only if I lose, Adolph.
- Tommy, the way you're goin'--

372
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,483
- Hey, horses got knees?
- I don't know. Fetlocks.

373
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:10,383
Well, if I was a horse,
I'd be down on my fetlocks
praying you don't bet on me.

374
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:12,983
- Drift, small guy.
- Drop dead, ape.

375
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:15,383
Come on, Tom.
Boss wants to see ya.

376
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:17,783
He didn't have time
to engrave nothin' formal.

377
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:42,383
What you mean, he's eatin' too much?
What's the goddamn doctor know?

378
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,283
- What you eat for lunch?
- A hot dog.

379
00:28:46,483 --> 00:28:49,983
-Just a hot dog?
- A hot dog and mustard.

380
00:28:50,183 --> 00:28:54,583
A hot dog and mustard.

381
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:57,983
A hot dog and mustard!

382
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:03,683
You hear that, Dane?
My kid is as smart as a whip.

383
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,583
Even Uncle Eddie
thinks that's funny.

384
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:09,583
Okay.

385
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:14,283
Go ahead. Which hand
is the penny in?

386
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:18,083
Choose again.

387
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:25,283
Okay. Here you go.
Take the penny.
Shiny new penny.

388
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:29,183
Take the kid,
wait in the car.
Give him a penny, boys!

389
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:34,983
- I ain't got a penny, boss.
- That's a penny you owe him.

390
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:38,583
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?
You like kids?

391
00:29:38,783 --> 00:29:41,883
- No.
- Have a seat. Go ahead.

392
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,383
Well, you're missin' out
on a complete life.

393
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,983
I know, kids, big deal.

394
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:50,983
Still, I'm telling you.

395
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,583
Anyways, thanks for comin' by.

396
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:58,683
I just wrote this check out
to your bookmaker Lazarre.

397
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:01,483
It's for an even 1,500,
which is more than I hear
you owe him,

398
00:30:01,683 --> 00:30:04,883
but I figured you could always
use some money on the cuff,
a high roller such as yourself.

399
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:08,083
- What do you say?
- Thanks.

400
00:30:10,283 --> 00:30:12,583
Always the yapper, huh?

401
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:16,983
Well, you're welcome.
You wanna know why I'm puttin'
you square with Lazarre?

402
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:20,383
- Not particularly.
- I want everybody to be friends.

403
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,883
I do this, you're friends
with Lazarre,

404
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:25,583
he's friends with you,
you're friends with me.

405
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:29,983
All you gotta do
to show you're a friend
is give me Bernie Bernbaum.

406
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:33,583
You know it's
the right thing anyway.
The shmatte steals from me.

407
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:37,683
I can't have Leo giving him
a shiny new penny.

408
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:39,883
So the deal is,
I give you Bernie,

409
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,483
smooth it over with Leo
and you bail me out with Lazarre.

410
00:30:42,683 --> 00:30:44,783
Yeah. Then we're all
friends again.

411
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:47,483
You, me, Leo, the Dane.

412
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:51,183
- We can maybe
have tea sometime.
- Come on, Eddie.

413
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,283
Friends is a mental state.

414
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,983
- What do you say, kid?
- I'll think about it.

415
00:30:58,283 --> 00:31:00,783
You'll think about it.

416
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:03,883
You hear that, Dane?
The kid's a thinker.
That's terrific.

417
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,783
- Does he want
a pillow for his head?
- Okay, kid. Think about it.

418
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:11,683
It's a mental state.
If it'll help you think,

419
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:14,283
you should know that if
you don't do this thing,

420
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:16,983
you're not gonna be
in any shape to walk out of here.

421
00:31:18,883 --> 00:31:22,283
Would that be physically,
or just a mental state?

422
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:32,683
That ain't friendly, kid.
I make you a nice offer,

423
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:35,283
you give me the high hat.

424
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:18,383
Hold it.

425
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,183
Jesus, Tom.

426
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:16,883
Just in the nick of time, huh?

427
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:24,583
Well, no harm done.
Unless your friend broke his foot.

428
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:27,983
- Where am I?
- Where are you? Johnny
Caspar's pleasure dome.

429
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:31,083
Same as when you left us
about ten seconds ago.

430
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:33,583
Hello, Tom. How are ya?

431
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:35,783
Care to scrape a knuckle
on your playmate here?

432
00:33:35,983 --> 00:33:38,683
- No. Thanks though, Andy.
- Well, if you
change your mind,

433
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,983
we'll be interrogating
for a while.

434
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:45,383
- What was that party
about, anyway?
- We do this every weekend.

435
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:48,183
Jesus, what is the matter
with you people?

436
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:51,083
Well, they said make it hurt,
so we make it hurt.

437
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,383
Drink, O'Doole?

438
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,683
I'm on duty.

439
00:34:01,883 --> 00:34:04,583
To Volstead.

440
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,083
-
- Any news about Rug?

441
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,683
Still dead, far as I know.

442
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:13,483
- Get a slug out of him?
- Yeah, .22.

443
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,183
Listen, Tom, I'm just
the chief around here,

444
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:18,483
so don't bother tellin' me
if you don't happen to
feel like it,

445
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,383
but what the hell is Leo doin'?

446
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:24,883
Make him listen to you, Tom.
It ain't right, all this fuss
over one sheeny.

447
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,883
Let Caspar have Bernie.
What's one Hebrew more or less?

448
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,983
We're burnin'
our meal ticket here.

449
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,283
Leo will do what suits him,
and you'll do what he tells you.

450
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:34,283
Last I heard, Leo was still
running this town.

451
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:36,983
Yeah, well, he won't be
for long if this keeps up.

452
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:39,783
It's no good for anyone.
You said as much yourself.

453
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:43,983
First off, O'Doole, I can
say what I please to Leo
and about him.

454
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,183
You can't.

455
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:49,783
Second, once Leo decides,
that's that.

456
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:52,283
If that sticks going down,
there are plenty
of coppers I know...

457
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:55,183
who wouldn't mind
bein' chief and could
swallow it clean.

458
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:59,383
Jesus, Tom,
I was just speculatin'
about a hypothesis.

459
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:01,583
I know I don't
know nothin'.

460
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,983
It's just a--
just a damn mess, is all.

461
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:30,283
Hello, Officer. I'd like to
report an intruder...

462
00:35:30,383 --> 00:35:33,383
at 346 West Lewis--

463
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:36,983
Who's this?
Hello, Shad. Tom Reagan here.

464
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:39,883
- You need the booze?
- No, we won't be
needing any today.

465
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:42,783
- False alarm, huh?
- Yeah. My mother.
She didn't recognize me.

466
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:45,183
Let me talk to Mulveany.
Miss me?

467
00:35:45,383 --> 00:35:47,683
Drop dead.

468
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:49,883
- Mulveany here.
- Sean?

469
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,883
Tell O'Doole to get a car
over to Leo's tonight.

470
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,883
If we're banging away
at Caspar, we oughta be ready
for him to bang back.

471
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,183
-
- What do you want?

472
00:35:57,383 --> 00:36:00,983
I was in the neighborhood,
feeling a bit daffy,

473
00:36:01,283 --> 00:36:04,083
so I thought I'd drop in
for an aperitif.

474
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:08,783
- Rug Daniels is dead.
- Gee, that's tough.

475
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:11,083
Don't get hysterical.

476
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:14,683
I've had enough excitement
for one night without a dame
going all weepy on me.

477
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,883
- I barely knew the gentleman.
-Rug?

478
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:21,283
A bit of a shakedown artist,
not above the occasional grift.

479
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:25,183
Bet you'd understand that.
All in all, not a bad guy,

480
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,683
if looks, brains
and personality don't count.

481
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:31,483
- You better hope they don't.
- Yeah, well--

482
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,083
We're none of us the saint
I hear your brother is.

483
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:36,383
- Who killed him?
- Leo thinks Caspar did.

484
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,483
- But you know better.
- I do now.

485
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:41,783
You see, Caspar just tried
to buy me into fixing
his tiff with Leo,

486
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:44,683
which he'd hardly do
if he was waging war.

487
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:48,783
So I figure you killed him, angel.
You or St. Bernard.

488
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:52,583
Why would I or my brother
kill Rug Daniels or anybody else?

489
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:56,683
Rug was following you.
He knew about you and me,

490
00:36:56,983 --> 00:36:59,483
and that wouldn't help
your play with Leo, would it?

491
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:01,683
You think I murdered someone?

492
00:37:01,883 --> 00:37:04,783
Come on, Tom.
You know me a little.

493
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:07,383
Nobody knows anybody.
Not that well.

494
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,683
You know, or you
wouldn't be here.

495
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:13,083
Not at all, sugar.
I came to hear your side of the story.

496
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:17,683
How horrible Rug was,
how he goaded you into it,
how he tried to shake you down.

497
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:19,983
- That's not why
you came either.
- Tell me why I came.

498
00:37:20,183 --> 00:37:23,183
- The oldest reason there is.
- There are friendlier
places to drink.

499
00:37:23,383 --> 00:37:25,283
- Why can't you admit it?
- Admit what?

500
00:37:25,383 --> 00:37:28,583
That you don't like
me seeing Leo
'cause you're jealous.

501
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:30,983
Admit that you've
got a heart,

502
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,583
even though it may be
small and feeble...

503
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:35,783
and you can't remember
the last time you used it.

504
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:38,983
If I'd known we were gonna
cast our feelings into words,

505
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:41,683
I'd have memorized
the Song of Solomon.

506
00:37:43,883 --> 00:37:46,983
Maybe that's why
I like you, Tom.

507
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,783
I never knew anybody
that made being
a son of a bitch...

508
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,683
such a point of pride.

509
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:55,683
Though one day you'll
pay the price for it.

510
00:37:57,183 --> 00:38:00,883
Okay, Verna.
But until then, let's get stinko.

511
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,483
Let's do something else first.

512
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:10,683
Yeah. Let's do plenty.

513
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:10,883
- Who's winning?
- We are, for the nonce.

514
00:42:10,983 --> 00:42:14,983
- What's the "disposish"?
- Last night, four to one. Dana
Cudahy went up with the house.

515
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,383
- And theirs?
- One burned.

516
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,283
- The other three?
- Lead.

517
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,383
- Whose?
- Leo's.

518
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:23,683
The old man's still
an artist with a Thompson.

519
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:25,783
Yeah, do that.

520
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:29,583
Well, find him, goddamn it!
Go and see if he fell in the john.

521
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:34,083
Son of a bitch. No chief.

522
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:37,483
- Who's mindin' the goddamn store?
-Can't raise O'Doole?

523
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:39,683
No, nor the mayor either.

524
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:44,083
- That's not good.
They're running.
- They wouldn't dare!

525
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:46,883
I don't know, Leo.
I warned you not to
hit Caspar's club.

526
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,783
- I'm still here, ain't I?
-Caspar's play hurt you anyway.

527
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:52,283
That sorry son of a bitch
just slit his own throat.

528
00:42:52,483 --> 00:42:55,483
Listen to me, Leo.
Last night made you
look vulnerable.

529
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:59,083
You don't hold elected office
in this town. You run it
because people think you run it.

530
00:42:59,183 --> 00:43:01,883
Once they stop thinking it,
you stop running it.

531
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:05,283
Jesus, Tom. It sounds like
a bad break for me
I wasn't killed!

532
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,483
I mean it, Leo.
Start taking Caspar seriously.

533
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:12,783
I know, I know.
Retreat to win, give up Bernie.
That'll solve all our problems.

534
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:14,983
Won't anymore, I'll grant you that.

535
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,583
But going toe-to-toe
with a psychopath
will get you nowhere.

536
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:20,283
It'll force people
to choose sides just when
you're looking shaky.

537
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:23,583
- The hell I do!
- Then where's the mayor?

538
00:43:23,783 --> 00:43:25,983
Why aren't there
any police here?

539
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,083
Why weren't there any police
at your place last night?

540
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:30,683
- I didn't ask for any.
- I did.

541
00:43:33,983 --> 00:43:36,683
Mother hen, huh?
What's the matter, Tommy?

542
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:40,283
- Don't you think
I can take care of myself?
- I know you can't.

543
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:43,183
Here's the smart play, Leo.
You lay back, you give Bernie up,

544
00:43:43,383 --> 00:43:45,283
you let Caspar think
he's made his point.

545
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:48,283
- Then you wait for him
to show a weakness.
- Please, Tom.

546
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,683
You're sticking on Bernie.
You're sticking your neck out...

547
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:53,683
for a guy who'd chop you off
at the heels if there
was two bits in it.

548
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:58,883
Tom,

549
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,283
things aren't as, uh,
clear-cut as you make it.

550
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:07,983
Bernie's--
Well, hell,you know
about me and Verna.

551
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:11,883
Things now are, uh--

552
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,683
Not that I haven't
been a gentleman, but--

553
00:44:17,983 --> 00:44:21,283
I plan to ask her
to marry me, Tom.

554
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,383
I guess you think
that's a bonehead play.

555
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:37,383
- You think she wants you to?
- How the hell do I know?

556
00:44:37,683 --> 00:44:40,283
I think she does.
Yeah, of course she does.

557
00:44:40,483 --> 00:44:44,183
I know you think different,
but, well, we just, uh--

558
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:46,683
We just differ on that.

559
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,583
Leo, Caspar didn't kill Rug.

560
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:56,383
- Course he did.
- No. Think about it
just this one time.

561
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:58,583
- Who was Rug following?
- Huh?

562
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:02,183
It needn't have been that
sinister. Strange man follows
her down a dark alleyway.

563
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:04,683
- I told you she can
look after herself.
- Verna wouldn't panic,

564
00:45:04,783 --> 00:45:07,883
shoot someone just because
he was following her.

565
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:11,683
Nah, it wouldn't have happened
like that, and if it had
she would have told me.

566
00:45:11,983 --> 00:45:15,083
They pulled a .22 slug out of him.
A pop gun, Leo, a woman's gun.

567
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:17,383
I know you don't
like her, Tom,

568
00:45:17,483 --> 00:45:20,383
but I trust Verna
as much as I trust you.

569
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,983
Okay, Leo.

570
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:26,283
Maybe it wasn't that innocent.

571
00:45:26,483 --> 00:45:29,983
Maybe Rug knew something
she didn't like him knowing
and wouldn't want you to know.

572
00:45:30,283 --> 00:45:33,783
Rug was following her.
Maybe he knew
where she was sleeping,

573
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,783
and who with.

574
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:42,383
Maybes don't make it so.

575
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,483
There's more than maybes.

576
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:49,083
You've trusted me before,
you've never lost anything
by it. Trust me on this.

577
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,383
- This is too important.
- I don't ask much,
and I don't ask often.

578
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,883
Trust me on this.

579
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:01,183
- Tommy.
- Trust me on this,
or to hell with you.

580
00:46:03,983 --> 00:46:06,183
You don't mean that.

581
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,983
She was with me...

582
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:14,383
the night Rug
was following her,

583
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:16,483
the night you dropped by.

584
00:46:30,183 --> 00:46:32,483
Oh.

585
00:48:28,683 --> 00:48:31,383
Okay, Leo. Okay.
I'll throw him out.

586
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:36,083
Yeah, do that.

587
00:48:37,283 --> 00:48:39,383
It's the kiss-off.

588
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,783
If I never see him again,
it'll be soon enough.

589
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:55,183
- Hello?
- Hello, Frankie.

590
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:57,683
It's Tom.
How's the flunky business?

591
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,283
I've had worse.
Your ventilator mending?

592
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,483
-
- Tell Caspar it's forgotten.

593
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:06,983
- I'd like to see him.

594
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:10,883
Ah. All right, let me know.

595
00:49:56,283 --> 00:50:00,083
It worked, whatever you did.

596
00:50:00,383 --> 00:50:03,583
Leo says we're quits.

597
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:06,383
But you know I didn't have
anything to do with Rug.

598
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:09,183
Maybe not.

599
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:11,283
Anyway, that isn't
what soured him on you.

600
00:50:11,483 --> 00:50:13,683
Oh, you and me, huh?

601
00:50:15,483 --> 00:50:18,983
You always take
the long way around to get
what you want, don't you, Tom?

602
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:23,583
You could have just asked.

603
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:29,383
What did I want?

604
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,083
Me.

605
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:00,883
Yeah?

606
00:51:00,983 --> 00:51:02,883
Yeah, yeah.

607
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,283
When?

608
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:07,283
Okay.

609
00:51:12,283 --> 00:51:14,883
You still up?

610
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:17,183
Yeah.

611
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:23,983
What are you chewin' over?

612
00:51:24,283 --> 00:51:26,383
Dream I had once.

613
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,183
I was walking in the woods.
I don't know why.

614
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:35,883
Wind came whippin'.
Blew me hat off.

615
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:40,783
And you chased it, right?

616
00:51:40,983 --> 00:51:43,283
You ran and ran.

617
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:46,483
You finally caught up to it.

618
00:51:46,783 --> 00:51:50,683
And you picked it up,
but it wasn't a hat anymore.

619
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:54,783
It had changed into something else,
something wonderful.

620
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:57,683
No, it stayed a hat.

621
00:51:57,783 --> 00:52:00,183
And no, I didn't chase it.

622
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:05,383
Nothing more foolish
than a man chasin' his hat.

623
00:52:05,683 --> 00:52:07,783
Where are you going?

624
00:52:07,983 --> 00:52:10,583
Just have to do a few things.

625
00:52:10,783 --> 00:52:14,083
- You and Leo might still
be able to patch things up.
- Me and Leo are finished.

626
00:52:14,283 --> 00:52:17,583
-Nothing's gonna change that.
- You never know.

627
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:21,483
- He's got a big heart.
- We're quits as far as I'm
concerned, never mind him.

628
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:25,783
And if Leo did want me back,
he's an even bigger sap
than I thought.

629
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:28,483
Then why don't we just
pick up and leave town?

630
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:31,383
There's nothing keeping you here.

631
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,383
I know there's nothing keeping me.

632
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,783
- What about Bernie?
- He could go with us.

633
00:52:38,183 --> 00:52:40,183
You, me and Bernie?
Where would we go, Verna?

634
00:52:40,383 --> 00:52:42,283
Niagara Falls?

635
00:52:42,383 --> 00:52:44,283
Why do you hate him?

636
00:52:44,383 --> 00:52:46,283
- I don't hate anyone.
-Or like anyone.

637
00:52:51,383 --> 00:52:53,483
Where is Bernie?

638
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,983
- Why?
- Leo can't protect him anymore.

639
00:52:56,183 --> 00:52:59,483
I oughta tell him to skip.

640
00:52:59,783 --> 00:53:01,583
The Royale, room 302.

641
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:10,483
I guess we both
double-crossed Leo, huh?

642
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:12,483
There's no gettin' around that.

643
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:16,483
I guess he's well rid
of both of us.

644
00:53:16,683 --> 00:53:20,883
The two of us, we're about
bad enough to deserve each other.

645
00:53:24,483 --> 00:53:26,383
Are we?

646
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:31,383
We're a couple of heels, Tom.

647
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:34,083
Yes, we are.

648
00:53:34,383 --> 00:53:38,583
So he says,
"Screw him. Give him a dollar.
This was my idea. "

649
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:42,383
Hello, Tom.

650
00:53:42,683 --> 00:53:45,783
Uh, you know O'Doole
and the mayor.

651
00:53:45,983 --> 00:53:49,083
- Hello, boys.
- Tom's a big booster.
Always has been.

652
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:53,183
That's fine, that's fine.
Well, Tom and I got
the proverbial fat to chew.

653
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:56,183
-Just let us know
if you need anything.
- Yeah. Happy days.

654
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:59,283
Have a seat, kid.
Yeah, that's it.

655
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:02,783
So,you had enough time
to think about things?

656
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:06,883
- Yeah, well, uh,
circumstances have changed.
- Don't I know it.

657
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:10,083
Last night I know the Dane
was disappointed
the bulls showed up...

658
00:54:10,283 --> 00:54:12,783
before Frankie and Tic-Tac
really pinned your ears back,

659
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:17,283
but I said, "Relax, Eddie.
I got a feeling about this kid.

660
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:21,583
The kid and Leo
are gonna go bust-o.
Matter of time."

661
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,483
I said, "The kid
is too smart for Leo."
That's what I said.

662
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:27,583
Like a psychic.
Ask the Dane if I did.
Like a goddamn psychic.

663
00:54:27,683 --> 00:54:30,083
-Go ahead, ask him.
- You vouch for that
psychic business?

664
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:32,783
- That's right, smart guy.
-I know you knew...

665
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:35,783
protecting the shmatte
was a dumb idea.

666
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:39,683
I know you've been wise
to all of Leo's dumb ideas lately.

667
00:54:39,783 --> 00:54:41,883
Only a matter of time-- bust-o.

668
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:45,083
That's why last night
we didn't put the arm on you,
only Leo.

669
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:48,583
Seeing how you squiffed
your play on Leo,
I can only be so grateful.

670
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:52,983
- Oh, that's real brave coming
from Little Miss Punching Bag.
- Okay, Eddie.

671
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:56,383
- Friends now, huh?
- Nuts.

672
00:54:58,183 --> 00:55:00,083
So, I guess you'll be
looking for a job, eh, kid?

673
00:55:00,183 --> 00:55:02,783
I might be.

674
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,883
You got references?
You been to college?

675
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:08,383
We only take yeggs
what's been to college.
Ain't that right, Dane?

676
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:14,483
I'm joking, of course.
We all know you could be
useful to us,

677
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:16,583
a smart kid such as yourself.

678
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:20,283
The man who walks behind the man,
who whispers in his ear.

679
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:24,083
- I guess you could be
useful in spades.
- Yeah, I can do plenty for you.

680
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:28,583
- Can you get Leo off me?
- I'm tellin' you
not to worry about Leo.

681
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,683
- We got plans for him.
- Oh,yeah?

682
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:33,483
- Like what?
- Not so fast there, "kaputnik."

683
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:36,083
I-I think what the Dane
is trying to say is,

684
00:55:36,383 --> 00:55:38,283
there'll be time
to talk about that.

685
00:55:38,283 --> 00:55:40,583
We can table that
for a later date.

686
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:46,583
See, last time we jawed,
you gave me the high hat.

687
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:49,283
I guess I'm sayin'...

688
00:55:49,483 --> 00:55:52,883
you gotta put something
on the table first.

689
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:55,683
- Ante up.
- Fair enough. Where do we start?

690
00:55:55,883 --> 00:55:59,283
Hear that, Dane? All business.
I told you he was a good kid.

691
00:55:59,483 --> 00:56:01,583
"Where do we start?"
All business.

692
00:56:01,783 --> 00:56:04,683
Well, we can start, for instance,
with the shmatte.

693
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:06,783
Like, where's the shmatte?
You could maybe tell us that.

694
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:10,883
The Royale, room 302.
And you might find Mink with him.

695
00:56:11,183 --> 00:56:13,083
The hell you say.

696
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:15,283
Sure. Bernie and Mink
are cozy as lice.

697
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:18,583
- And it ain't just business.
- This guy is lying.

698
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:20,583
- Why would I?
- This guy is wrong.

699
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:25,683
This guy is all wrong.
Mink is clean and this clown
is a smart guy.

700
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:29,583
It's easy enough to find out,
ain't it?

701
00:56:30,883 --> 00:56:35,183
You find Mink,
you bring him back here.

702
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:40,883
Go to the car.
I'm gonna send Frankie and
Tic-Tac with you to the Royale.

703
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,283
If Bernie's there,

704
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:45,683
Frankie and Tic-Tac'll
take care of him.

705
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:48,183
And if he's not there?

706
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:51,583
I'll sit facing the corner
in a funny hat.

707
00:56:53,383 --> 00:56:55,983
- Get your little hebe ass
in the car.

708
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:58,183
- Let's go.
Come on,you skel.

709
00:56:58,283 --> 00:57:00,283
What are you doing to me?

710
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,483
- We're going to
Miller's Crossing.
-I didn't do-- Tom! Tom!

711
00:57:02,683 --> 00:57:05,083
- Lock him up.
Jesus! Are you part of this?

712
00:57:05,183 --> 00:57:07,283
- Sit still, hymie.
- You can't be part of this.

713
00:57:07,483 --> 00:57:10,083
I think these guys
are gonna whack me!
Tom,you gotta talk to 'em!

714
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:12,983
- You're giving me a headache,
you little sheeny. Let's go!
- Talk to 'em!

715
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,483
Get me outta here!

716
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,983
Oh, Tommy.!

717
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:23,083
Get him outta here!
- Frankie!

718
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:26,083
- Come on! Come on!

719
00:57:28,483 --> 00:57:30,483
- Tic-Tac!
- Quiet him down!

720
00:57:30,683 --> 00:57:32,583
Uuh!

721
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,683
- Get up, you skel!

722
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:36,783
- Come on.
- Frankie, no!

723
00:57:36,983 --> 00:57:40,283
- Get up, you son of a bitch.
- Frank-- Aah!

724
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,083
- Oh, Frankie!
- Get up, you kike!

725
00:57:43,283 --> 00:57:46,983
Okay, take him in the woods
and whack him.

726
00:57:47,283 --> 00:57:49,383
- What?
- That's right.

727
00:57:49,483 --> 00:57:52,283
The boss wants you to do it.
Make sure you're with the good guys.

728
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:55,283
- You know how to do this, right?
- You little yid! Get up!

729
00:57:55,483 --> 00:57:57,483
Ya gotta remember
to put one in his brain.

730
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,583
Your first shot puts him down.
Then you put one in his brain.

731
00:58:00,683 --> 00:58:02,683
Then he's dead.
Then we go home.

732
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,583
Get up and walk.

733
00:58:08,783 --> 00:58:10,983
I can't get up. I can't get up.

734
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:16,083
- Get up and walk,
you pissing little yid!
- Let's go!

735
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:39,283
Tommy, you can't do this.
You don't bump guys.

736
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:41,683
You're not like
those animals back there.

737
00:58:44,183 --> 00:58:46,283
It's not right, Tom.

738
00:58:46,483 --> 00:58:48,783
They can't make us do this.

739
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:52,983
It's a wrong situation.
They can't make us
different people than we are.

740
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,183
We're not muscle.
I never killed anybody.

741
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:57,783
I used a little information
for a chisel, that's all.

742
00:58:57,983 --> 00:59:00,483
It's my nature, Tom.
I can't help it.

743
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:04,383
Somebody hands me an angle,
I play it. I don't deserve
to die for that.

744
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,383
Do you think I do?

745
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:11,783
I'm just a grifter.
Huh, Tom? I'm a nobody!

746
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:15,283
But I tell you what--
I never crossed a friend.

747
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,883
I never killed anybody,
I never crossed a friend.

748
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,883
We're not like those animals.

749
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:21,883
This is not us.

750
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:24,583
This is a dream!

751
00:59:24,783 --> 00:59:27,883
It's a dream, Tommy!
I'm praying to you!

752
00:59:27,983 --> 00:59:29,883
I can't die.

753
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,883
I can't die...

754
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:35,683
out here in the woods
like a dumb animal.

755
00:59:35,783 --> 00:59:38,183
In the woods like a dumb animal!

756
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,183
Like a--
Like a dumb animal!

757
00:59:41,483 --> 00:59:44,983
I can't--
I can't-- I can't die
out here in the woods...

758
00:59:45,183 --> 00:59:47,683
like a dumb animal.

759
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:51,083
I can't... die!

760
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,883
I'm praying to you.

761
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:01,383
Look in your heart.

762
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,583
I'm praying to you.

763
01:00:04,883 --> 01:00:08,983
Look in your heart.
I'm praying to you.

764
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:11,883
Look in your heart.

765
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:15,283
I'm praying to you!

766
01:00:15,483 --> 01:00:17,483
Look in your heart!

767
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:22,083
I'm praying to you!
Look in your heart.

768
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:25,283
I'm praying to you!

769
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:29,683
Look in your heart!
Look in your heart!

770
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:32,083
You can't kill me.

771
01:00:32,283 --> 01:00:35,083
- Look in your heart.

772
01:00:50,383 --> 01:00:53,283
- Tommy--
- Shut up. You're dead. Get me?

773
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:58,483
I understand. I'm dead.

774
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,983
- God bless you.
-Shut up.

775
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:04,383
You have to disappear for good.
No one can see you.
No one can know.

776
01:01:04,683 --> 01:01:07,783
- God bless you.
-Go somewhere no one knows you.

777
01:01:07,983 --> 01:01:11,283
Anyone sees you,
you really are dead.
You're not my problem anymore.

778
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,883
Of course not.
You've done your share. Thank you.

779
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:16,883
- Don't worry. I understand.
-Shut up. Shut up.

780
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:20,483
- Thank you.
- Shut up. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

781
01:01:20,783 --> 01:01:23,183
God bless you.

782
01:01:54,283 --> 01:01:56,183
Put one in his brain?

783
01:01:57,483 --> 01:01:59,483
- Yeah.
Atta boy.

784
01:02:16,183 --> 01:02:18,383
Mink? Tom Reagan.
Where you been?

785
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:27,783
Will you look?
Eddie Dane's been looking for you.

786
01:02:27,883 --> 01:02:29,783
- Bernie's dead.
-Jesus Christ!

787
01:02:29,983 --> 01:02:33,983
Stop wailing and listen to me.
Caspar knows you were
in on selling out his fix.

788
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,483
- Who the hell
gave him that idea?
- Heh!

789
01:02:36,683 --> 01:02:40,083
- I guess I gave him that idea.
Sorry. It just slipped out.
- What are you trying to do?

790
01:02:40,283 --> 01:02:43,083
Shut up and let me talk.
You lay low till Caspar
cools off.

791
01:02:43,383 --> 01:02:47,883
Then tell him the Dane was in
on the sellout, and I'll
make Caspar go easy on you.

792
01:02:48,183 --> 01:02:50,983
- You got me into this mess.
- That's right, I got you into this.

793
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:54,583
-Just remember, Mink, I'm the
only one who can get you out.
- Wait a minute, Tom.

794
01:02:54,783 --> 01:02:57,483
Waah! Uuh!

795
01:03:04,483 --> 01:03:08,383
Hello, Terry.
Getting out the vote?

796
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:13,983
A message from Leo.
Leo says if you're smart
you'll sit this one out,

797
01:03:14,283 --> 01:03:16,683
not that he cares one way
or the other.

798
01:03:16,883 --> 01:03:21,183
Leo says if you're on
the wrong side you take
your chances like anybody else.

799
01:03:21,483 --> 01:03:23,883
Leo says he gives
no special favors, that's all.

800
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,883
Tell Leo he's not God
on the throne.

801
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:30,683
He's just a cheap political boss
with more hair tonic than brains.

802
01:03:30,783 --> 01:03:34,283
Uhh!

803
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,083
Did Leo say that as well?

804
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:41,083
No, I said that.

805
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,683
Cross Leo,
next time I'll say plenty.

806
01:03:51,983 --> 01:03:54,883
When you're right,you're right.

807
01:03:54,983 --> 01:03:58,183
But you never say,
"I told you so."

808
01:03:58,483 --> 01:04:00,483
So what am I right about?

809
01:04:01,883 --> 01:04:04,483
Well, I'll tell you.

810
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:08,283
But first you gotta promise
not to say I told you so.

811
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:12,483
I never say that,
and I don't like people who do.

812
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:17,583
Mink was robbing me
right along with the shmatte.

813
01:04:17,783 --> 01:04:19,583
What convinced you of that?

814
01:04:19,683 --> 01:04:21,883
Mink took a powder.
We can't find him.

815
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,383
The Dane, he's making
excuses for him.

816
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:26,883
But personally,
I think you was right.

817
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:29,583
I think that Mink and Bernie
was in it together.

818
01:04:29,883 --> 01:04:33,183
I think Mink heard
that you bumped
the shmatte and lit out.

819
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:35,483
Lousy son of a bitch.

820
01:04:37,383 --> 01:04:40,783
- I told you so.
- What?

821
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:46,683
You got a lip on you.
That's all right.

822
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,883
I don't generally care for it,
but that's all right.

823
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:54,083
You was a good sport
to bump the shmatte.

824
01:04:55,283 --> 01:04:57,283
How do you know
Mink skipped?

825
01:04:57,483 --> 01:05:00,183
- Because the Dane can't find him.
- So he says.

826
01:05:00,383 --> 01:05:04,283
- Meaning what exactly?
-Maybe nothing.

827
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:08,483
I didn't give it much thought,
'cause a guy'll say anything
when his number is up.

828
01:05:08,783 --> 01:05:11,383
But, uh,just before
I bumped Bernie,

829
01:05:11,483 --> 01:05:14,483
he swore to me
that Eddie Dane and Mink
were setting him up--

830
01:05:14,683 --> 01:05:17,483
that they were the ones
who sold out your fix.

831
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:28,083
Well, uh--

832
01:05:28,183 --> 01:05:30,483
Well, like you say, uh,
a guy'll say anything.

833
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:32,983
So why isn't
Eddie Dane here?

834
01:05:34,783 --> 01:05:37,283
Well, he don't
care for you, kid.

835
01:05:38,483 --> 01:05:41,283
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

836
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:44,883
After you left us,
he tried to sell me
on a double-cross.

837
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:47,883
He says to me,
why don't we double-cross you
and give you the bump...

838
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,883
after we get the shmatte.

839
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:53,883
Well, I figure a dea"s a deal.
You're square with me.

840
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:58,583
You bump the shmatte,
I hold up my end.
It's a question of ethics.

841
01:05:58,883 --> 01:06:02,983
Everything above board so
everybody knows who's a friend,
who's an enemy.

842
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:07,583
So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me.

843
01:06:07,783 --> 01:06:09,583
We go back.

844
01:06:11,683 --> 01:06:16,583
Of course there's always
that wild card when,
uh, love is involved.

845
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:21,783
I know Mink
is Eddie Dane's boy.

846
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:26,383
Still, I--
I don't make it that way.

847
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:31,483
- Then there's nothing
to worry about.
- Yeah.

848
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:35,883
Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister! Papa, Papa,
I got a prize from the sister!

849
01:06:36,183 --> 01:06:39,483
- Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister!
- Yeah.Just a minute.

850
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,683
- Of course, then, there's
no reason-- Shut up!
- Papa, Papa, I got--

851
01:06:41,883 --> 01:06:45,183
You take a page
out of this guy's book.

852
01:06:45,283 --> 01:06:49,183
- A little less you talk,
a little more you think!

853
01:06:51,683 --> 01:06:53,883
Kids. You gotta be firm.

854
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:58,583
Anyways, there's no reason
not to check things out.

855
01:06:58,883 --> 01:07:02,183
If Mink is around,
I want you to find him.
He can tell us what's what.

856
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:05,283
What's the matter?
Somebody hit you?

857
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:08,283
What's the matter?
Aren't we friends anymore?

858
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:11,283
If you find him,
I wanna talk to him alone.

859
01:07:11,383 --> 01:07:13,883
That's the way you get
the straight dope--man to man.

860
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:17,683
Just me, Mink...
and my friend Roscoe.

861
01:07:17,883 --> 01:07:20,483
You understand
what I'm saying?

862
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:22,983
- It ain't complicated.

863
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:37,983
You should leave town
for a few days. Things are
gonna heat up around here.

864
01:07:38,283 --> 01:07:40,583
Go to the Palisades.
I'll join you soon as I'm done.

865
01:07:40,783 --> 01:07:43,583
I can't find Bernie.
Did you find him?

866
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,883
Yeah.

867
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,183
Is he leaving?

868
01:07:49,383 --> 01:07:53,583
He, uh-- He left.

869
01:07:53,783 --> 01:07:56,283
- He say where to?
- He didn't say.

870
01:07:56,483 --> 01:07:58,583
- You--
- Thanks.

871
01:08:12,283 --> 01:08:15,483
- What's that
potato-eater up to?
- Beats me.

872
01:08:15,783 --> 01:08:18,083
- That's Bernie's sister, ain't it?
- Beats me.

873
01:08:18,283 --> 01:08:20,583
- What's he seeing her for?
- Beats me. Maybe--

874
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:24,383
Shut up. Get lost.

875
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:26,983
I'll see where
the twist flops.

876
01:08:28,283 --> 01:08:31,683
You know who I am?

877
01:08:31,883 --> 01:08:34,383
Yeah,Johnny Caspar's shadow.
What, did he stay in bed today?

878
01:08:34,683 --> 01:08:38,483
Jesus. I open my mouth,
the whole world turns smart.

879
01:08:38,683 --> 01:08:42,083
- You're Leo's twist, right?
- Me and Leo are through.

880
01:08:42,383 --> 01:08:44,983
Yeah?
So you're sluttin' around
with Tom now, huh?

881
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,783
You get outta here.

882
01:08:47,983 --> 01:08:50,183
Okay. See you later.

883
01:08:52,383 --> 01:08:54,683
Before I go,
what's your boyfriend up to?

884
01:08:54,883 --> 01:08:56,883
- Nothing I know about.
- Yeah?

885
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:59,083
That doesn't
figure for me--

886
01:08:59,283 --> 01:09:02,283
you dumpin' Leo for the guy
who put a bullet in your brother.

887
01:09:06,383 --> 01:09:10,783
He didn't tell you. Aww.

888
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,883
Spin her, Eddie.

889
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,483
Ooh!

890
01:09:32,483 --> 01:09:36,483
- You Leo's?
- Yeah. He wanted her
looked-out for.

891
01:09:36,683 --> 01:09:40,783
Well,you did a bang-upjob.
I'll be sure to tell him.

892
01:09:40,983 --> 01:09:44,883
- Where's Leo?
- If I tell you, how do I know
you won't kill me?

893
01:09:45,183 --> 01:09:50,183
Because if you told me and I
killed you and you were lying,
I wouldn't get to kill you then.

894
01:09:50,383 --> 01:09:52,983
- Where's Leo?
- He's moving around.

895
01:09:53,183 --> 01:09:57,083
- He's getting his mob together
tomorrow at Whiskey Nick's.
- You sure?

896
01:09:57,383 --> 01:09:59,183
Check it. It's gold.

897
01:09:59,383 --> 01:10:02,883
You know what,yegg?
I believe you.

898
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,083
Go ahead and run, sweetie.

899
01:10:27,283 --> 01:10:30,583
I'll track down
all of you whores.

900
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:34,583
Hello, Bernie. Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

901
01:11:34,783 --> 01:11:37,683
Hello, Tom.

902
01:11:37,883 --> 01:11:41,483
I thought I'd do that,
since you didn't seem to be in.

903
01:11:41,783 --> 01:11:45,783
Figured it was a bad idea
to wait in the hall, seeing
as I'm supposed to be dead.

904
01:11:48,983 --> 01:11:51,383
How'd you know it was me?

905
01:11:51,483 --> 01:11:53,883
You're the only one I know
who'd knock and then break in.

906
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,983
Your other friends
wouldn't break in?

907
01:11:56,183 --> 01:11:59,183
My other friends
want to kill me,
so they wouldn't knock.

908
01:11:59,383 --> 01:12:01,783
What's on your mind. Bernie?

909
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:06,583
Things.

910
01:12:06,683 --> 01:12:11,983
I guess you must be angry.
I'm supposed to be
gone far away.

911
01:12:12,183 --> 01:12:15,183
I guess it seems sort of
irresponsible, my being here.

912
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:21,283
And I was gonna leave.
Honest, I was.

913
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:23,283
But then I started thinking...

914
01:12:23,483 --> 01:12:26,183
if I stuck around,
that would not be good for you.

915
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:28,983
Then I started
thinking that--

916
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,483
that might not
be bad for me.

917
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,483
You didn't see
the play you gave me.

918
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:39,883
I mean, what am I gonna do?

919
01:12:39,983 --> 01:12:42,783
If I leave, I got nothing.

920
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:45,583
No money, no friends, nothing.

921
01:12:45,783 --> 01:12:47,883
If I stay, I got you.

922
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:52,383
Anyone finds out I'm alive,
you're dead, so...

923
01:12:54,683 --> 01:12:56,683
I got-- I got you, Tommy.

924
01:12:59,283 --> 01:13:02,583
What's the matter?
You got nothing
to crack wise about?

925
01:13:02,683 --> 01:13:05,083
Bernie ain't
so funny anymore?

926
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:11,183
I guess I made kind of
a fool of myself out there...

927
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,983
bawling away like a twist.

928
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,483
I guess--

929
01:13:18,683 --> 01:13:20,483
I guess I turned yellow.

930
01:13:20,683 --> 01:13:24,283
- You didn't tell anyone
about that?
- No.

931
01:13:24,383 --> 01:13:26,483
Of course,
you know about it.

932
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,683
It's a painful memory...

933
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:39,283
and I can't help remembering
that you put the finger on me,

934
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:42,483
and you took me out there
to whack me.

935
01:13:42,783 --> 01:13:46,183
I know... you didn't.
I know.

936
01:13:46,383 --> 01:13:50,083
- You didn't shoot me, but--
- But what have I done
for you lately?

937
01:13:50,283 --> 01:13:52,283
Don't smart me.

938
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:56,183
See, I want
to watch you squirm.

939
01:13:57,883 --> 01:14:00,283
I want to see you
sweat a little.

940
01:14:02,283 --> 01:14:04,283
And when you smart me...

941
01:14:05,883 --> 01:14:08,183
it ruins it.

942
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,483
There's one other thing I want.

943
01:14:22,483 --> 01:14:25,183
I want to seeJohnny Caspar
cold and stiff.

944
01:14:25,283 --> 01:14:28,583
That's what you'll do
for your friend Bernie.

945
01:14:31,883 --> 01:14:34,983
In the meantime,
I'll stay out of sight.

946
01:14:35,183 --> 01:14:38,483
But if Caspar ain't stiff
in a couple of days...

947
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,683
I start eating
in restaurants.

948
01:14:54,683 --> 01:14:56,783
Oof!.

949
01:15:00,783 --> 01:15:03,483
Uuh!

950
01:15:03,683 --> 01:15:05,683
You make me laugh, Tommy.

951
01:15:05,783 --> 01:15:09,283
You're gonna catch cold.
Then you're no good to me.

952
01:15:09,383 --> 01:15:12,183
What were you gonna do
if you caught me?

953
01:15:12,483 --> 01:15:15,783
I'd just squirt a few,
and then you'd let me go again.

954
01:15:22,883 --> 01:15:26,083
Hello, Tad.
How's the club holding up?

955
01:15:26,283 --> 01:15:29,783
We're managing to squeak by
without you.
Got Lazarre's money?

956
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:33,083
- No.
- You're not supposed to be here
since you turned rat.

957
01:15:33,183 --> 01:15:35,683
Relax, Tad.
Leo isn't around, is he?

958
01:15:35,883 --> 01:15:39,783
Last couple of days you booked
any heavy bets on a long shot
at Saturday's fights?

959
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:42,083
Why the hell
should I tell you?

960
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:45,883
The truth is, Tad,
no reason on Earth.

961
01:15:48,683 --> 01:15:50,583
Saturday's fights?

962
01:15:50,683 --> 01:15:54,483
DropJohnson put two grand
on one yesterday--

963
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:58,083
on Sailor Reese,
an undercard bum.

964
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:01,183
DropJohnson.
He play your book much?

965
01:16:01,383 --> 01:16:04,583
- Are you kidding? I didn't
even know he could count.

966
01:16:04,783 --> 01:16:06,883
Jesus. You bring them with you?

967
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:10,383
Hello, Brian.
Still fighting the good fight?

968
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:12,783
Hello, Tom.
Neither rain nor wind nor snow.

969
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:14,983
That's the mailman. O'Doole here?

970
01:16:21,483 --> 01:16:24,283
Hello, O'Doole.
You don't look happy.

971
01:16:24,483 --> 01:16:26,483
Look at this mess.

972
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:29,883
Guttin' the golden calf again.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

973
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:33,683
Yeah, it's awful confusing.
You know a yegg
named DropJohnson?

974
01:16:33,883 --> 01:16:36,483
- We spanked him
a couple of times.
- Where does he flop?

975
01:16:36,683 --> 01:16:38,783
- Terminal Hotel, Bay Street.

976
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:43,183
Jesus!
Look, don't nobody ask me since
I'm just the chief around here,

977
01:16:43,483 --> 01:16:45,483
but I'll tell you my opinion.

978
01:16:45,683 --> 01:16:49,783
Caspar is just as crazy as Leo,
and an "eye-tie"
into the bargain.

979
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:53,083
What's the matter, O'Doole?
Doesn't anything ever suit you?

980
01:17:03,283 --> 01:17:05,983
Hop in, Tom.
We been lookin'for you.

981
01:17:06,283 --> 01:17:08,583
- I'm busy.
- Hop in anyway.

982
01:17:08,783 --> 01:17:11,883
You can't hijack me, Tic-Tac.
We're on the same side now.

983
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:14,783
Or didn't you get
that far in school?

984
01:17:24,183 --> 01:17:25,983
How'd you get the fat lip?

985
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:30,383
- Old war wound.
Acts up around morons.
- Very smart.

986
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:33,583
What were you doing
at the club, talking
things over with Leo?

987
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:36,583
Don't think so hard, Eddie.
You might sprain something.

988
01:17:36,783 --> 01:17:39,383
You are so goddamn smart.

989
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:41,383
Except you ain't.

990
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,383
I get you, smart guy.
I know what you are.

991
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:46,483
Straight as a corkscrew.

992
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:48,483
Mr. Inside Out-ski,

993
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:52,583
like some goddamn Bolshevik
picking up his orders
from Yegg Central.

994
01:17:52,883 --> 01:17:54,883
You think you're
so goddamn smart.

995
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:57,183
You join upJohnny Caspar,

996
01:17:57,283 --> 01:17:59,283
you bump Bernie Bernbaum.

997
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:03,883
Up is down. Black is white.

998
01:18:05,283 --> 01:18:08,283
Well, I think you're half smart.

999
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,883
I think you were straight
with your frail,

1000
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:13,583
I think you were queer
with Johnny Caspar...

1001
01:18:13,783 --> 01:18:17,783
and I think you'd sooner
join a ladies' league
than gun a guy down.

1002
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:22,283
Then I hear from these
two geniuses they never even
saw this rub-out take place.

1003
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:26,183
- Boss said to have him do it.
He didn't say nothing about--
- Shut up!

1004
01:18:26,483 --> 01:18:29,583
Or maybe you still got
too many teeth.

1005
01:18:32,283 --> 01:18:36,283
Everyone is so goddamn smart.

1006
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:40,183
Well, we'll go out
to Miller's Crossing...

1007
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:43,183
and we'll see who's smart.

1008
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:11,583
You understand if we don't
find a stiff out here,
we leave a fresh one.

1009
01:19:28,683 --> 01:19:31,483
Where are your friends
when you need 'em, huh?

1010
01:19:32,883 --> 01:19:35,183
Where's Leo now?

1011
01:19:37,283 --> 01:19:39,583
Hey, Tic-Tac!

1012
01:19:39,783 --> 01:19:43,483
You ever notice how
the snappy dialogue dries up...

1013
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:46,083
once a guy starts
soiling his union suit?

1014
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:34,183
Okay. There's nothing out here.

1015
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:51,983
- Think about this... smart guy.

1016
01:20:52,183 --> 01:20:54,983
It's hanky time.

1017
01:20:59,883 --> 01:21:03,083
- Birds have been at him.

1018
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:05,683
Jesus Christ.

1019
01:21:30,483 --> 01:21:34,283
Told you
to put one in his brain,
not in his stinkin' face!

1020
01:21:38,383 --> 01:21:41,983
I told you, Dane.
We heard two shots.

1021
01:22:09,683 --> 01:22:11,683
Hello, Drop.

1022
01:22:15,483 --> 01:22:17,783
How are the Katzenjammers?

1023
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:20,583
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?

1024
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,183
Had any visitors?

1025
01:22:24,383 --> 01:22:26,383
Uhh, no.

1026
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:28,383
Not ever, Drop?

1027
01:22:28,483 --> 01:22:30,383
Not lately.

1028
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:32,983
Then you must be happy to see me.

1029
01:22:36,383 --> 01:22:38,183
So, uh...

1030
01:22:38,383 --> 01:22:42,083
you didn't see Bernie Bernbaum
before he was shown across.

1031
01:22:42,283 --> 01:22:44,183
Uh, no.

1032
01:22:44,383 --> 01:22:46,283
Seen him since?

1033
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:50,783
One last question, Drop.

1034
01:22:50,983 --> 01:22:55,383
You got a lot of money
on tomorrow's fight.

1035
01:22:55,683 --> 01:22:59,583
That your bet, or, uh...
you placing it for a friend?

1036
01:22:59,783 --> 01:23:01,683
No, no, no, it's my bet.

1037
01:23:01,783 --> 01:23:06,283
- I just have a good feeling
about that fight.
- A good feeling, huh?

1038
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:09,083
When did a feeling
return to your head?

1039
01:23:09,283 --> 01:23:11,783
You've outgrown that one.

1040
01:23:11,983 --> 01:23:14,083
Must be all the thinking
you been doing.

1041
01:23:14,283 --> 01:23:17,183
Tell Bernie something's come up,
he has to get in touch.

1042
01:23:17,483 --> 01:23:20,383
There'll be nothing stirring
till I talk to him.

1043
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:57,783
All right, anyone left in there,
come on out grabbing air.
You know the drill.

1044
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:16,483
Aah!

1045
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:01,983
Hello, Tom.
Where you been hiding?

1046
01:25:02,183 --> 01:25:04,383
Hither and yon.
Is the mayor in?

1047
01:25:04,483 --> 01:25:06,883
- He's with Mr. Caspar.
- That's who I'm looking for.

1048
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:10,183
- Scare me up some gargle, will you?
- Sure. I'll announce you.

1049
01:25:10,283 --> 01:25:12,983
Don't bother. I'm well-liked.

1050
01:25:14,783 --> 01:25:17,783
I can't do it.
I'll look ridiculous.
It simply isn't done.

1051
01:25:17,983 --> 01:25:20,883
-Assistants, maybe.
- For a mayor, you don't hear so hot.

1052
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,983
I said head.
Head of the assessor's office.

1053
01:25:24,183 --> 01:25:28,183
- But there are two of them.
- I can count. Co-heads.

1054
01:25:28,483 --> 01:25:31,383
Johnny, needless to say,
this office will do
anything in its power...

1055
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:34,083
to assist you and your cousins.

1056
01:25:34,283 --> 01:25:35,783
We did it for Leo, of course,
on countless occasions.

1057
01:25:35,883 --> 01:25:37,883
We did it for Leo, of course,
on countless occasions.

1058
01:25:37,983 --> 01:25:41,783
Damn right.
Had every potato-eater from
County Cork on the public tit.

1059
01:25:41,983 --> 01:25:44,283
But there's a way we do things,

1060
01:25:44,483 --> 01:25:47,483
hallowed by usage
and consecrated by time.

1061
01:25:47,783 --> 01:25:52,683
- When we put people on the pad
when Leo was running things--
- Leo ain't runnin' things!

1062
01:25:52,883 --> 01:25:57,183
I ain't interested
in ancient history!
I'm runnin'things now!

1063
01:25:57,383 --> 01:25:59,783
Nobody can appreciate it
more than I.

1064
01:25:59,983 --> 01:26:02,183
I can give them jobs.
I can give them good jobs.

1065
01:26:02,383 --> 01:26:05,383
I can even give them jobs
where they won't have
to perform any work,

1066
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:08,283
where their lack of English
will be no impediment, but I can't--

1067
01:26:08,383 --> 01:26:10,583
What is this, the high hat?

1068
01:26:10,783 --> 01:26:15,783
Tom, can you explain it to him?
I can put them in public works,
but I can't--

1069
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:17,883
You can do whatever
the hell Caspar tells you.

1070
01:26:18,083 --> 01:26:20,483
I don't remember
all this double talk
when Leo gave you an order.

1071
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:24,683
- Tom.Jesus!
- Stop whimpering
and do as you're told.

1072
01:26:24,983 --> 01:26:28,083
- You can start
by gettin'out of here.
-Johnny, it's my office.

1073
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:32,983
Get out of here!
Take it on the heel and toe
before I whack you one!

1074
01:26:35,483 --> 01:26:37,783
- You two beat it.

1075
01:26:37,883 --> 01:26:41,883
-
- Yeah, go and keep
the mayor company.

1076
01:26:42,183 --> 01:26:45,083
I'll take care
of ya's later.

1077
01:26:54,683 --> 01:26:57,483
- Runnin' things--
it ain't all gravy.

1078
01:26:57,783 --> 01:27:01,683
- What's the fireworks?
-Knocking over one of Leo's clubs.

1079
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,883
Son of a bitch
won't go belly up.

1080
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:08,183
I'm sorry, kid.
I heard about your
little ride this morning.

1081
01:27:08,383 --> 01:27:10,183
Yeah, well,
sorry don't fix things.

1082
01:27:10,383 --> 01:27:14,083
We could just as easily
have missed Bernie's corpse,
and I'd be dead now.

1083
01:27:14,183 --> 01:27:17,783
I know, I know, but that don't mean
the Dane's up to anything.

1084
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:21,783
So he hears a rumor
that Bernie ain't dead.
These stories pop up.

1085
01:27:21,983 --> 01:27:25,083
Any stories
about Bernie being alive
the Dane's made up himself.

1086
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:28,983
You don't know that.
It don't make sense. Why would he?

1087
01:27:29,283 --> 01:27:31,583
There could be
a damn good reason...

1088
01:27:33,383 --> 01:27:36,083
if you got
a fixed fight coming up.

1089
01:27:38,483 --> 01:27:41,483
- Do you?
- Maybe.

1090
01:27:43,283 --> 01:27:47,183
Okay, yeah, sure.
Tomorrow night.
The fix is in. What of it?

1091
01:27:47,383 --> 01:27:49,583
- The Dane know about it?
- Yeah.

1092
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:55,983
Okay, I get it.

1093
01:27:56,183 --> 01:27:58,983
If the Dane's been selling
you out on these fights
and means to again,

1094
01:27:59,183 --> 01:28:02,183
- he's gonna have to have somebody
else to point the finger at.
- Yeah, I get it.

1095
01:28:02,383 --> 01:28:04,683
With Bernie dead,
there ain't a hell of a lot
of people he can point to.

1096
01:28:04,883 --> 01:28:08,483
Yeah, the Dane sells me out,
makes pretend Bernie's still
doing it.

1097
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,583
That's real pretty.

1098
01:28:10,783 --> 01:28:14,683
Bernie leaked the fix,
and you take the fall
for not killing him.

1099
01:28:16,883 --> 01:28:21,183
But I don't know.
Why would Eddie cross me
like that? Money?

1100
01:28:21,383 --> 01:28:23,583
Okay, everybody likes money,

1101
01:28:23,683 --> 01:28:26,783
but somehow it just
don't seem like him.

1102
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:31,283
- And I know the Dane.
- Nobody knows anybody.
Not that well.

1103
01:28:31,583 --> 01:28:34,183
Money don't mean
that much to him.

1104
01:28:34,383 --> 01:28:36,483
Then it's not just
the money he's after.

1105
01:28:36,683 --> 01:28:40,283
- He's got a wart on his fanny.
- Huh?

1106
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:43,983
A wart on his fanny
giving him the fidgets.

1107
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:46,483
Maybe he's sick of sitting
on the couch.

1108
01:28:46,683 --> 01:28:49,783
Maybe behind your desk
don't look like a bad place to move to.

1109
01:28:49,883 --> 01:28:52,283
Kid, you got a lip on you.

1110
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,883
But you're honest.

1111
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:59,583
That's something we can't
get enough of in this business.

1112
01:29:03,283 --> 01:29:06,583
I'll admit since last we jawed...

1113
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,183
my stomach's
been seizing up on me.

1114
01:29:09,283 --> 01:29:12,183
If the Dane's saying
we should double-cross you--

1115
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:16,383
You double-cross once,
where's it all end?

1116
01:29:16,683 --> 01:29:19,383
An interesting ethical question.

1117
01:29:24,883 --> 01:29:27,983
I'll find the Dane,
talk to him,
straighten things out.

1118
01:29:28,283 --> 01:29:31,583
- Sure, talk to him.
Have a chat.
- I'll take care of it.

1119
01:29:31,683 --> 01:29:34,683
- Ask him if he's selling you out.
I'm sure he'll come clean.
- I'll take care of it.

1120
01:29:34,883 --> 01:29:38,283
- You're swimmin' in it.
- I said I'd take care of it!

1121
01:29:47,983 --> 01:29:51,383
-Johnny.

1122
01:29:51,483 --> 01:29:55,683
My chin's hanging out
right alongside yours.

1123
01:29:57,583 --> 01:30:00,883
I'd worry a lot less if
I thought you were worrying enough.

1124
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,283
But I am, kid.

1125
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:12,883
Christ.

1126
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,583
Running things.

1127
01:30:26,983 --> 01:30:29,283
- Yeah?
I got your message.

1128
01:30:29,483 --> 01:30:32,483
Oh, Bernie. I had a dream
about you the other day.

1129
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:35,983
- Yeah? A nightmare?
- On the contrary. Very sweet.

1130
01:30:36,283 --> 01:30:39,383
I dreamt you were
lying out at Miller's Crossing
with your face blown off.

1131
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:42,883
You get a kick out of that?
- I was in stitches.

1132
01:30:43,183 --> 01:30:45,883
- It's Mink, isn't it?
- I came back.
He wasn't happy to see me.

1133
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:47,883
- Can you beat that?
- Some friend.

1134
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:49,983
Yeah. You know what
a nervous boy he was.

1135
01:30:49,983 --> 01:30:53,683
I figured you're a friend,
maybe you could use
some insurance.

1136
01:30:53,983 --> 01:30:55,883
Did Mink have a .22?

1137
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:00,983
-He already ditched it. Why?
- After he shot Rug?

1138
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:04,183
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter.

1139
01:31:04,283 --> 01:31:08,883
- I've been thinking about
our deal. You can stick it
in your ear.  - Huh?

1140
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:12,383
You don't have anything
on me that I don't have on you,
so I'm calling your bluff.

1141
01:31:12,683 --> 01:31:14,883
- Wait a minute.
- I'm pulling out
tomorrow morning.

1142
01:31:14,983 --> 01:31:18,483
You only have to decide
whether or not I leave behind
a message for Caspar...

1143
01:31:18,683 --> 01:31:20,483
that you're still around.

1144
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:22,983
If you want me to keep
my mouth shut, it's gonna
cost you some dough.

1145
01:31:23,183 --> 01:31:25,683
I figure a thousand bucks
is reasonable, so I want two.

1146
01:31:25,783 --> 01:31:28,883
- In a pig's eye!
- I'm going out. I'll be back
at 4:00 this morning.

1147
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:31,983
If you're not here at my place,
4:00, with the dough,

1148
01:31:32,183 --> 01:31:35,383
- Caspar's gonna be
looking for you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1149
01:31:43,283 --> 01:31:46,583
- Got any money?
- No.

1150
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:50,383
Okay.

1151
01:32:04,783 --> 01:32:06,683
Third race tonight.

1152
01:32:06,783 --> 01:32:10,483
By the finish, Tailor Made
had a view of the field.

1153
01:32:10,783 --> 01:32:13,083
You oughta lay off
the ponies, Tom.

1154
01:32:19,783 --> 01:32:21,583
Okay.

1155
01:32:27,983 --> 01:32:31,383
Lazarre said he's sorry about this.
It's just getting out of hand.

1156
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:33,483
Yeah.

1157
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,483
He likes you, Tom.

1158
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:38,083
He said we didn't have to
break anything.

1159
01:32:38,983 --> 01:32:41,083
It's okay.

1160
01:32:41,183 --> 01:32:43,683
Tell him there's
no hard feelings. Heh!

1161
01:32:43,883 --> 01:32:47,883
Christ, Tom...
he knows that.

1162
01:32:50,683 --> 01:32:52,783
Take care now.

1163
01:33:07,183 --> 01:33:09,083
- Tom Reagan.
- Yes, sir.

1164
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:12,683
- Mr. Caspar's in the great room.
- Swell. Can you hold these?

1165
01:33:14,383 --> 01:33:16,283
Kid, what's the rumpus?

1166
01:33:16,483 --> 01:33:18,283
I got news.

1167
01:33:18,483 --> 01:33:21,483
Yeah. News at this end too.

1168
01:33:21,683 --> 01:33:24,083
My stomach's been
seizing up on me.

1169
01:33:24,183 --> 01:33:26,783
- Mink just told me that he--
- Eh?

1170
01:33:26,983 --> 01:33:30,383
- You talked to Mink?
- Yeah, on the phone.

1171
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:33,583
The Dane wants you to think
that he's disappeared
so you can't talk to him,

1172
01:33:33,783 --> 01:33:36,683
- but he's been here in town.
- You sure it was Mink?

1173
01:33:36,883 --> 01:33:40,583
Yeah. See for yourself.
He's coming to my place,
4:00 this morning.

1174
01:33:40,883 --> 01:33:44,483
He's afraid of
a crossing with Dane.
He told me about the fix.

1175
01:33:44,683 --> 01:33:47,883
He says he'll sing for
a couple of grand skip money,
tell us everyone involved.

1176
01:33:48,183 --> 01:33:50,483
But you'd better take care
of the Dane tonight.

1177
01:33:50,683 --> 01:33:53,383
Mink says he's
coming after us tonight.

1178
01:33:59,583 --> 01:34:01,983
Leo's holed up
at Whiskey Nick's dump.

1179
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:04,083
What? How do you know?

1180
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:07,083
That ain't all we know, smart guy.

1181
01:34:08,383 --> 01:34:11,483
Recognize your playmate?

1182
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,383
You thought I'd quit, huh? Uh-uh.

1183
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:21,383
I followed you
this afternoon,

1184
01:34:21,683 --> 01:34:25,183
and I wondered why Einstein
would wanna talk to a gorilla.

1185
01:34:25,283 --> 01:34:28,683
So I grabbed the gorilla,
and I beat it out of him.

1186
01:34:28,983 --> 01:34:32,383
You give me a big guy
every time. They break easy.
Not like you.

1187
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:35,883
Is there a point,
or are you just brushing up
on your small talk?

1188
01:34:36,183 --> 01:34:39,483
I like that.
Cool under fire.

1189
01:34:40,783 --> 01:34:42,683
I'm impressed.

1190
01:34:44,383 --> 01:34:47,883
The gorilla didn't know
whose stiff we found,
but I can fill that in.

1191
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:50,983
You killed Mink,
you son of a bitch!

1192
01:34:52,283 --> 01:34:55,583
It was Mink,
you son of a bitch.

1193
01:34:55,883 --> 01:35:00,483
It was Mink, and by God,
I'll hear you say it.

1194
01:35:00,783 --> 01:35:03,083
Is this how you told Drop
his story?

1195
01:35:05,483 --> 01:35:07,683
Come here, bum.

1196
01:35:11,483 --> 01:35:14,583
I am gonna send you
to a deep, dark place,

1197
01:35:14,783 --> 01:35:17,483
and I am gonna have fun doing it.

1198
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:35,883
Oof!.

1199
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:41,083
You son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
You lousy son of a bitch!

1200
01:35:41,483 --> 01:35:45,083
If there's one thing
I can't stand,
it's a double-cross artist!

1201
01:35:47,683 --> 01:35:50,583
I had a theory
about this son of a bitch!

1202
01:35:54,983 --> 01:35:59,683
Shut up, you lousy
son of a bitch, or I'll give you
something to holler about!

1203
01:35:59,983 --> 01:36:02,983
Johnny, it's okay.
The Dane made him do it.
It's not important.

1204
01:36:03,283 --> 01:36:06,683
Then make him shut it!

1205
01:36:06,883 --> 01:36:10,583
And we do the same to Mink
this very same night!

1206
01:36:10,783 --> 01:36:13,583
We can't double-cross Mink.
He wants to spill the whole setup.

1207
01:36:13,783 --> 01:36:17,283
- I've never let
a son of a bitch walk.
- You've never crossed anyone.

1208
01:36:17,483 --> 01:36:20,783
4:00, my place. Mink's
coming in on his own hook,
so I promised him the money.

1209
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:26,183
- Don't make me out
to be a liar.

1210
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:31,283
Look at this, kid.

1211
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:35,883
Something I try to teach
all my boys.

1212
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:48,383
Always put one in the brain.

1213
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:12,083
What's the rumpus?

1214
01:37:12,283 --> 01:37:15,683
I was just in the neighborhood
feeling a little daffy.

1215
01:37:15,983 --> 01:37:18,183
- What are you doing?
- Walking.

1216
01:37:18,283 --> 01:37:20,483
Don't let on more
than you have to.

1217
01:37:20,683 --> 01:37:22,483
In the rain.

1218
01:37:27,183 --> 01:37:29,083
Bernie's dead, isn't he?

1219
01:37:30,483 --> 01:37:33,483
- What makes you think that?
- That's no answer.

1220
01:37:38,283 --> 01:37:40,883
I can't tell you
anything yet.

1221
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:43,883
No one really cares, do they?

1222
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:48,983
- His friends
didn't really like him.
- He didn't like his friends.

1223
01:37:49,183 --> 01:37:52,283
You're someone to talk.
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

1224
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:55,383
You got me
to tell you where he was,
and then you killed him.

1225
01:37:56,683 --> 01:37:58,683
I want to know why.

1226
01:37:58,783 --> 01:38:02,483
- What was in it for you?
- Nothing for me.

1227
01:38:07,083 --> 01:38:10,683
Giving up Bernie was
the only way I could see to
straighten things out for Leo.

1228
01:38:12,783 --> 01:38:15,583
I thought you said
you didn't care about Leo.

1229
01:38:15,783 --> 01:38:19,283
I said we were through.
It's not the same thing.

1230
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,983
I don't understand.
I don't care.

1231
01:38:22,183 --> 01:38:25,383
I don't care what reasons you had
or you thought you had.

1232
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:27,983
He's still alive.

1233
01:38:30,183 --> 01:38:32,183
You expect me to believe you?

1234
01:38:37,583 --> 01:38:39,483
No.

1235
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:45,783
That's you all over, Tom.

1236
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:48,383
A lie and no heart.

1237
01:39:06,283 --> 01:39:08,183
Oh--

1238
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,783
It isn't easy, is it, Verna?

1239
01:39:33,483 --> 01:39:37,283
But before
you even think about doing
that, you gotta towel down.

1240
01:39:37,483 --> 01:39:42,783
So you towel down first
with a hot towel,
as hot as you can stand.

1241
01:39:42,983 --> 01:39:45,483
Put the razor
in cold water, not hot,

1242
01:39:45,683 --> 01:39:48,283
because metal
does what in cold?

1243
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:52,783
- I don't know,Johnny.
- That's why I'm telling you!
It contracts.

1244
01:39:55,083 --> 01:39:58,783
That way you get
a first-class shave every time.

1245
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:00,983
Okay,Johnny.

1246
01:40:03,683 --> 01:40:05,683
Ain't it the life though?

1247
01:40:09,383 --> 01:40:12,783
Hello, Sal. You can dangle.

1248
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:17,683
Hello, Tom. You sure?
You don't look so hot.

1249
01:40:17,983 --> 01:40:19,683
I'm okay.

1250
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:24,583
I'll drive him home.

1251
01:41:17,183 --> 01:41:19,883
Mr. Reagan, there were shots.

1252
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:22,883
Go down to the drug store
and call the police.

1253
01:41:24,683 --> 01:41:27,483
You'd better stay there
till the officers arrive.

1254
01:41:28,683 --> 01:41:30,683
Will my cats be all right?

1255
01:41:30,783 --> 01:41:32,783
Yeah, they'll be fine.

1256
01:42:24,683 --> 01:42:27,583
I get it. You set me up.

1257
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:30,583
Anything to avoid
a little dirty work yourself, huh?

1258
01:42:32,783 --> 01:42:35,983
How'd you know he'd get it
and not me? Or didn't you care?

1259
01:42:36,283 --> 01:42:38,683
I figured you'd come early
looking for blood.

1260
01:42:38,883 --> 01:42:41,683
He wouldn't, so you'd likely
have the drop on him.

1261
01:42:43,383 --> 01:42:47,483
You're right.
The chump never knew what hit him.

1262
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:50,983
But if you knew
I'd come to kill you,
how do you know I won't still?

1263
01:42:51,183 --> 01:42:54,083
There's nothing in it
for you now.

1264
01:42:54,283 --> 01:42:57,083
With him dead, you and me
got nothing on each other.

1265
01:42:58,183 --> 01:43:00,583
- Let me have the gun.
- Why?

1266
01:43:00,783 --> 01:43:03,183
Pin this on the Dane.

1267
01:43:03,283 --> 01:43:06,183
Neither of us want him
walking around after this.

1268
01:43:06,383 --> 01:43:09,983
The cops'll be Leo's now.
They won't care what
they hang the Dane for.

1269
01:43:10,183 --> 01:43:12,083
I guess that's true,

1270
01:43:12,283 --> 01:43:16,483
if you don't mind keeping
the gun that killed Caspar
and Mink.

1271
01:43:17,683 --> 01:43:19,983
Why did Mink
shoot Rug anyway?

1272
01:43:20,183 --> 01:43:22,083
I don't know.
It was just a mix-up.

1273
01:43:22,283 --> 01:43:24,583
Here.

1274
01:43:27,483 --> 01:43:31,083
- So you're gonna say
the Dane did this?
- Sure.

1275
01:43:31,283 --> 01:43:33,983
Mink thought Rug
was tailing him.

1276
01:43:34,183 --> 01:43:36,683
You know Mink. Hysterical.
Skin full of hop,
head full of boogeymen.

1277
01:43:36,883 --> 01:43:41,183
Comes home crying one day,
saying he had to pop
one of the Dane's spies.

1278
01:43:41,483 --> 01:43:44,883
Rug was tailing Verna,
not Mink. Mink just
happened to be with her.

1279
01:43:45,083 --> 01:43:46,983
Funny, ain't it?

1280
01:43:47,083 --> 01:43:50,183
Mink was terrified
the Dane'd find out me and him
were jungled up together.

1281
01:43:50,383 --> 01:43:53,283
I bet you kept him
worried about that to
keep him under your thumb.

1282
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:55,883
Yeah, so what?
Scratch, huh?

1283
01:43:56,083 --> 01:43:58,583
A little bonus.

1284
01:43:58,683 --> 01:44:01,983
- Why did Mink take Rug's hair?
- Beats me. The kid was dizzy.

1285
01:44:02,183 --> 01:44:06,183
Fifty-fifty on the dough?
Or maybe I should get more,
since I did the deed.

1286
01:44:08,883 --> 01:44:11,583
Okay, you keep it.
I want you to have it.

1287
01:44:18,483 --> 01:44:23,083
Bernie... we can't pin this
on the Dane.

1288
01:44:23,283 --> 01:44:28,883
- Why not?
- Because the Dane's already
dead halfway across town.

1289
01:44:29,183 --> 01:44:32,283
- What the hell
are you talking about?
- Eddie Dane is dead.

1290
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,383
It's gotta be you.

1291
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:38,383
I mean, it was your gun.

1292
01:44:40,783 --> 01:44:44,783
What is this?
What the hell are you talking about?

1293
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:47,383
You--

1294
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:50,983
You took my gun.
It's just your word against mine.

1295
01:44:54,483 --> 01:44:56,583
Not necessarily.

1296
01:44:57,683 --> 01:44:59,783
Are you crazy?

1297
01:44:59,983 --> 01:45:03,183
We're square.
You said it yourself.
We got nothing on each other.

1298
01:45:03,383 --> 01:45:05,683
Yep.

1299
01:45:05,783 --> 01:45:10,083
So what's in it for you?
There's no angle.

1300
01:45:10,283 --> 01:45:13,083
You can't just shoot me
like that.

1301
01:45:16,683 --> 01:45:20,083
Jesus Christ,
it don't make sense.

1302
01:45:22,383 --> 01:45:24,283
Tommy--

1303
01:45:26,283 --> 01:45:28,783
Tommy!

1304
01:45:30,583 --> 01:45:32,483
Look in your heart.

1305
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:37,683
- Look in your heart.
- What heart?

1306
01:46:22,883 --> 01:46:24,883
Tad? It's Tom.

1307
01:46:26,383 --> 01:46:29,283
Tell Lazarre
I got his money.

1308
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:31,383
Yeah, all of it.

1309
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:34,383
I wanna place a bet
on tonight's fight.

1310
01:46:39,483 --> 01:46:41,283
- They set you up downstairs?
- How's that?

1311
01:46:41,483 --> 01:46:43,583
A little hooch, whatever?

1312
01:46:43,683 --> 01:46:46,483
Thanks for coming, Tom.
Leo's real anxious to see you.

1313
01:46:46,683 --> 01:46:48,683
Yeah, I happened to be near.

1314
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:54,183
Well, uh, actually this might
not be the best time.

1315
01:46:54,383 --> 01:46:57,183
- Who's he got in there?
- O'Doole and the mayor.

1316
01:46:57,383 --> 01:47:01,883
- I'll try again.
- They're planting the sheeny
tomorrow. You could stop by.

1317
01:47:31,283 --> 01:47:34,783
- Big turnout.
- Drop dead.

1318
01:47:34,983 --> 01:47:36,983
She's under a lot of strain.

1319
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:40,583
- Yeah, well, at least
she didn't hit me.

1320
01:47:40,683 --> 01:47:43,983
Glad you came, Tommy.

1321
01:47:44,183 --> 01:47:47,883
- I guess, uh-- Huh?
- She's taking the car.

1322
01:47:52,683 --> 01:47:55,683
- I guess we're walkin'.
- Guess we are.

1323
01:48:00,783 --> 01:48:02,883
We're, uh--
We're getting married.

1324
01:48:05,783 --> 01:48:08,183
Congratulations.

1325
01:48:08,383 --> 01:48:13,383
Funny thing is, she asked me to
tie the knot. I guess you're
not supposed to say that.

1326
01:48:13,683 --> 01:48:16,383
- It doesn't matter.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1327
01:48:17,983 --> 01:48:20,783
Hell, Tom, why didn't you
tell me what you were up to?

1328
01:48:20,883 --> 01:48:23,283
I thought you'd
really gone over.

1329
01:48:23,383 --> 01:48:26,883
Not that I didn't deserve it,
but you could've told me.

1330
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:30,483
Telling you would only
have queered things if it--

1331
01:48:30,783 --> 01:48:33,583
There just wasn't any point.

1332
01:48:33,783 --> 01:48:35,583
I can see that.

1333
01:48:37,183 --> 01:48:40,083
It was a smart play all around.

1334
01:48:40,283 --> 01:48:43,183
I guess you know I'm grateful.

1335
01:48:43,383 --> 01:48:45,283
No need.

1336
01:48:47,083 --> 01:48:49,783
Heh!
I guess you picked
that fight with me...

1337
01:48:49,983 --> 01:48:53,283
just to check yourself
in with Caspar.

1338
01:48:53,383 --> 01:48:57,083
I don't know.
Do you always know
why you do things, Leo?

1339
01:48:57,383 --> 01:48:59,183
Sure I do.

1340
01:49:01,383 --> 01:49:04,083
- It was a smart play.
- Fine.

1341
01:49:07,383 --> 01:49:10,783
Jesus, Tom, I'd do anything
if you'd work for me again.

1342
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:14,283
I know I've made
some bonehead plays,
I know I can be pigheaded,

1343
01:49:14,383 --> 01:49:16,883
but, damn it, so can you.

1344
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:21,383
I need you.
Things can be the way they were.

1345
01:49:21,683 --> 01:49:23,883
I know it.
I just know it.

1346
01:49:23,983 --> 01:49:28,383
As for you and Verna,
well, I understand.

1347
01:49:28,683 --> 01:49:31,383
You're both young.

1348
01:49:31,483 --> 01:49:33,683
Damn it, Tom, I forgive you.

1349
01:49:33,883 --> 01:49:36,183
I didn't ask for that,
and I don't want it.

1350
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:44,483
Good-bye, Leo.
