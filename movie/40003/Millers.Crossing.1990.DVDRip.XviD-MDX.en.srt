[ Man ]
I'm talkin'about friendship.

3
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,688
I'm talkin'about character.

4
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:33,199
I'm talkin'about- -
Hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed
to use the word.

5
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,429
I'm talkin' about ethics.

6
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,562
You know I'm a sportin' man.

7
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,072
I like to lay the occasional bet.
[ Chuckles ]

8
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,701
But I ain't that sportin'.

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,711
When I fix a fight--
Say I pay a three to one favorite...

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,805
to throw a goddamned fight.

11
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:53,012
I figure I got the right
to expect that fight
to go off at three to one.

12
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,817
But every time I lay in bed
with this son of a bitch
Bernie Bernbaum,

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,189
before I know it,
the odds is even up.

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,751
Or worse, I'm bettin'
on the short money.

15
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,126
The sheeny knows
I like sure things.

16
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,656
He's sellin' the information
I fixed the fight.

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,101
Out of town money
comes pouring in.

18
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,401
The odds go straight to hell.

19
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,840
I don't know who
he's sellin' to-- maybe
the Los Angeles combine.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,844
I don't know. The point is,

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:23,076
Bernie ain't satisfied
with the honest dollar
he can make off the vig.

22
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,414
He ain't satisfied with
the business I do on his book.

23
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,387
He is sellin' tips on how I bet.

24
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,619
And that means part
of the payoff that should
be riding on my hip...

25
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,853
is riding on someone else's.

26
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,453
So, back we go
to these questions--

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,432
friendship, character,

28
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,833
ethics.

29
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,032
So, it's clear what I'm saying?

30
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,344
As mud.

31
00:01:55,915 --> 00:02:01,615
It's gettin' so a businessman
can't expect no return
from a fixed fight.

32
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:05,146
Now, if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

33
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,626
For a good return, you gotta
go bettin'on chance,

34
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,925
and then you're
back with anarchy.

35
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,931
Right back in the jungle.

36
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:18,062
That's why ethics is important- -
what separates us
from the animals,

37
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,639
the beasts of burden,
the beasts of prey.

38
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,675
Ethics.

39
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,940
Whereas, uh, Bernie Bernbaum
is a horse of a different color,

40
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:30,744
ethics-wise, as in
he ain't got any.

41
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,913
- You sure it's Bernie
selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

42
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,890
- No one else knows about the fix?
- No one that ain't got ethics.

43
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,984
What about the fighters
you pay to tank out?

44
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,997
We only pick fighters
we know we can put
the fear of God in.

45
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,363
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

46
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,665
I-I lay an occasional bet
with Mink Larouie.

47
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,263
- But it ain't Mink.
I'll vouch for that.
- How do you know?

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,605
It ain't Mink.
Mink is Eddie Dane's boy.

49
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,476
Of course the Dane
always knows about the fix.

50
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,675
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

51
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,277
Let it drift. All it means is
a lot of people know.

52
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,719

been listenin'.

[ Chuckles ]

That's why we gotta go
to this question of character...

to determine just who, exactly,
is chiselin' in on my fix.

that it's Bernie Bernbaum,

he's kinda shaky.

what else is new?

153
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,898
But the situation now--
I'm worried.

154
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,445
Verna can take care of herself,
maybe better than you can.

155
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,040
- What does that mean?
- Want another one?

156
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,050
No.

157
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,177
What does that mean?

158
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,654
How far she got
her hooks into you?

159
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,816
That's a hell of a question.

160
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,258
It's a grift.

161
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,992
If she didn't need you
to protect her brother
from Johnny Caspar,

162
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,729
you think she'd still be going
on slow carriage rides with you
through the park?

163
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,207
That's the deal, isn't it?
You keep Bernie under wraps
till Caspar cools down?

164
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:33,143
Jesus, you're a prickly pear.
What's wrong with her wanting
her brother taken care of?

165
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,180
Nothing. I don't blame her.

166
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,579
She sees the angle,
which is you, she plays it.

167
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,619
She's a grifter,
just like her brother.

168
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,950
Probably had grifter parents
and grifter grandparents...

169
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,116
and someday they're each
gonna spawn little grifter kids.

170
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,423
Stop it, Tommy.
I don't like to hear my friends
run down, even by other friends.

about this. You don't know
what's in Verna's heart.

I put a tail on her this afternoon.

181
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,021
- Uh-huh.
- I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around,

182
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,293
just, you know,
to keep her out of trouble.

183
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,496
I was worried.
After that meeting with Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

184
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,903
- So what did Rug say that has you
scurrying over here?
- That's just it.

185
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:40,640
- Nothing. He's disappeared.
- So you lost your lady friend
and the tail you put on her?

186
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,307
I guess it does sound
pretty sorry at that.

Help me out, Tom.
I wouldn't know where
to start lookin'.

I've been trying to tell you.

You can't trade
body blows with him.
He's gotten too strong.

I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

I told him you were a tramp

a bad break for me

Here's the smart play, Leo.
You lay back, you give Bernie up,

you let Caspar think
he's made his point.

- Then you wait for him
to show a weakness.
- Please, Tom.

I plan to ask her
to marry me, Tom.

I guess you think
that's a bonehead play.

Yeah, of course she does.

- Course he did.
- No. Think about it

- Who was Rug following?
- Huh?

- Verna wouldn't panic,

he was following her.

622

Nah, it wouldn't have happened
like that, and if it had
she would have told me.

A pop gun, Leo, a woman's gun.

Maybe it wasn't that innocent.

she didn't like him knowing
and wouldn't want you to know.

not to say I told you so.

884
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:12,528
I never say that,
and I don't like people who do.

885
01:04:15,172 --> 01:04:17,503
Mink was robbing me
right along with the shmatte.

886
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:19,508
What convinced you of that?

887
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:21,874
Mink took a powder.
We can't find him.

888
01:04:21,946 --> 01:04:24,379
The Dane, he's making
excuses for him.

889
01:04:24,448 --> 01:04:26,915
But personally,
I think you was right.

890
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:29,578
I think that Mink and Bernie
was in it together.

891
01:04:29,687 --> 01:04:33,122
I think Mink heard
that you bumped
the shmatte and lit out.

892
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:35,488
Lousy son of a bitch.

893
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:40,721

- What?

[ Laughs ]

You got a lip on you.
That's all right.

01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:49,829
I don't generally care for it,
but that's all right.

897
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:54,142
You was a good sport
to bump the shmatte.

898
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:57,304
How do you know
Mink skipped?

899
01:04:57,381 --> 01:05:00,213
- Because the Dane can't find him.
- So he says.

900
01:05:00,284 --> 01:05:04,310
- Meaning what exactly?
- Maybe nothing.

901
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:08,447
I didn't give it much thought,
'cause a guy'll say anything
when his number is up.

902
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,288
But, uh, just before
I bumped Bernie,

903
01:05:11,362 --> 01:05:14,455
he swore to me
that Eddie Dane and Mink
were setting him up- -

904
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:17,465
that they were the ones
who sold out your fix.

905
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:28,010
Well, uh--

906
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,410
Well, like you say, uh,
a guy'll say anything.

907
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:32,915
So why isn't
Eddie Dane here?

908
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:37,314
Well, he don't
care for you, kid.

909
01:05:38,391 --> 01:05:41,325
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

910
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:44,884
After you left us,
he tried to sell me
on a double-cross.

911
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:47,897
He says to me,
why don't we double-cross you
and give you the bump...

912
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:49,900
after we get the shmatte.

913
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:53,959
Well, I figure a deal's a deal.
You're square with me.

914
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:58,771
You bump the shmatte,
I hold up my end.
It's a question of ethics.

915
01:05:58,843 --> 01:06:03,074
Everything above board so
everybody knows who's a friend,
who's an enemy.

916
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:07,678
So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me.

917
01:06:07,752 --> 01:06:09,685
We go back.

918
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:16,685
Of course there's always
that wild card when,
uh, love is involved.

919
01:06:19,431 --> 01:06:21,898
I know Mink
is Eddie Dane's boy.

920

Still, l--
I don't make it that way.

to worry about.
- Yeah.

We could just as easily
have missed Bernie's corpse,
and I'd be dead now.

I know, I know, but that don't mean
the Dane's up to anything.

So he hears a rumor
that Bernie ain't dead.
These stories pop up.

Any stories
about Bernie being alive
the Dane's made up himself.

It don't make sense. Why would he?

There could be
a damn good reason...

1187

a fixed fight coming up.

you out on these fights
and means to again,

1193

- he's gonna have to have somebody
else to point the finger at.
- Yeah, I get it.

1194

there ain't a hell of a lot
of people he can point to.

1195

makes pretend Bernie's still
doing it.

that much to him.

the money he's after.
