2
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,775
I'm talking about friendship.

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,447
I'm talking about character.
I'm talking about...

4
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:37,244
Hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed to use
the word. I'm talking about ethics.

5
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:41,999
You know I'm a sporting man.
I like to lay the occasional bet.

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,460
But I ain't that sporting.

7
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:49,590
When I fix a fight, say I pay
a 3-to-1 favorite to throw a fight,

8
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,761
I got the right to expect
that fight to go off at 3-to-1 .

9
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,890
But when I bet with this
son of a bitch Bernie Bernbaum,

10
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,934
before I know it, the odds even up.

11
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,023
Or, I'm betting on the short money.
The sheeny knows I like sure things.

12
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,568
He's selling the information
I fixed the fight.

13
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:14,031
Out-of-town money pours in.
The odds go straight to hell.

14
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:19,620
I don't know who he's selling to,
maybe the Los Angeles combine.

15
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:24,249
Bernie ain't satisfied with the honest
dollar he can make off the vig,

16
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:30,255
or the business I do on his book.
He is selling tips on how I bet.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,719
So part of the payoff that should ride
on my hip rides on someone else's.

18
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,305
So back we go to these questions.

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,807
Friendship.

20
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,184
Character.

21
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,228
Ethics.

22
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,858
So it's clear what I'm saying?

23
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,987
As mud.

24
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:02,454
It's getting so a businessman can't
expect no return from a fixed fight.

25
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,999
Now if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

26
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,294
For a good return,
you gotta bet on chance.

27
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,549
Then you're back with anarchy.
Right back in the jungle.

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:19,096
That's why ethics is important.
What separates us from the animals,

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,392
the beasts of burden,
beasts of prey, ethics.

30
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:29,481
Whereas Bernie Bernbaum is a horse
of a different color, ethics-wise.

31
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,608
As in, he ain't got any.

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,737
-You sure it's Bernie selling you out?
-It ain't elves.

33
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,575
-No one else knows about the fix?
-No one without ethics.

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:46,165
LEO: What about the fighters that tank out?
-We only pick those we can threaten.

35
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,168
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

36
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:54,214
-I sometimes bet with Mink Larouie.
-It ain't Mink.

37
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,385
LEO: How do you know?
-It ain't Mink. He's Eddie Dane's boy.

38
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,306
Of course. The Dane
always knows about the fix.

39
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,600
What the hell does that mean?

40
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:08,103
Let it drift.
It means a lot of people know.

41
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,900
I guess you ain't been listening.
Sure, other people know.

42
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:19,239
That's why we question character to
determine who's chiseling in on my fix.

43
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,243
And that's how we know it's
Bernie Bernbaum, the Shmatte Kid.

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,330
Because ethically, he's kind of shaky.

45
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,416
So you wanna kill him.

46
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,668
For starters.

47
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:50,646
Sorry, Caspar.
Bernie pays for protection.

48
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:57,069
Leo, I ain't asking for permission.
I'm telling you as a courtesy.

49
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:01,531
-It's gonna get done.
-You'll have trouble.

50
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,494
You came to see if I'd kick if you
killed Bernie. There's your answer.

51
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,456
I pay off to you every month
like a greengrocer,

52
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,126
more than the Shmatte,
and I'm getting the high-hat!

53
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,421
LEO: You pay off for protection,
like everyone else.

54
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:21,260
Far as I know, the cops
haven't closed your dives,

55
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,971
and the DA hasn't touched
any of your rackets.

56
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:28,558
You haven't bought a license
to kill bookies. I ain't selling any.

57
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,561
So take your flunky and dangle.

58
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,108
I'm not some guinea
fresh off the boat you can kick.

59
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,195
I'm too big now.
I'm sick of taking the strap from you.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,616
I'm sick of marching in here
to kiss your Irish ass!

61
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,869
And I'm sick of the high-hat!

62
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,930
You's fancy-pants, all of youse.

63
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:14,938
Johnny, you're exactly as big
as I let you be and no bigger,

64
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,316
and don't forget it. Ever.

65
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,989
That's right, Leo.
You're the big shot around here.

66
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,618
And I'm just some schnook
likes to get slapped around.

67
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:39,087
Twist a pig's ear, watch him squeal.

68
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,096
Bad play, Leo.

69
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,683
-You got up the wrong side, huh?
-Same side as always.

70
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,895
That's what I mean.
Still owe Lazarre money?

71
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,565
-I could put it right for you.
-I don't need it.

72
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:04,404
You haven't played a winner in weeks.
People'll talk if he breaks your legs.

73
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,241
-People'll say I had it coming.
-They'll be right.

74
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,120
Call me a big-hearted slob,
but I'll square it.

75
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,707
I think I'll do that
this very same night.

76
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:20,545
Looking at you moping around
takes away my... What do you call it?

77
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,215
-Joy de veever?
-Joie de vivre.

78
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:27,844
-If you laugh at me, the hell with you.
-The hell with you.

79
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:33,642
I'll square myself with Lazarre.
That's why God invented cards.

80
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,855
-There's one thing you can do.
-Name it.

81
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,236
Think about what protecting Bernie gets
us and what offending Caspar loses us.

82
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,532
-You know I don't like to think.
-Yeah.

83
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,993
Well, think about
whether you should start.

84
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,351
TAD:
Wake up, Tommy.

85
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,852
I am awake.

86
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,482
TAD: Your eyes are shut.
-Who you gonna believe?

87
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,203
-How'd I do?
-What do you think?

88
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,624
You are a millionaire.
You gonna remember your friends?

89
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,921
-Where's me hat?
-You bet it, mug.

90
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:12,425
Good thing the game broke up
before you bet your trousers.

91
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:19,015
-Who made off with me hat?
-Verna. Verna and Mink.

92
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,644
-Who?
-Mink and Verna.

93
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:33,113
-Is Thunderclap running tonight?
-Thunderclap?

94
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,033
-Yeah.
-What's she leaving at?

95
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,786
3-to-1 , more than likely.

96
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,416
Lay off, Tom. You shouldn't go
deeper in the hole.

97
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,296
Tell Lazarre I want 500 on the nose.

98
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,965
You would have it.

99
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,439
TOM:
I want me hat.

100
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,149
Is that all you came for?

101
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,778
Yeah. I want me hat.

102
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,989
It's mine. I won it.

103
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,409
-What are you gonna do with it?
-Drop dead.

104
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,127
TOM:
I need a drink.

105
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,422
Why didn't you say so?

106
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,405
[KNOCKING]

107
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,440
Hello, Tommy. Sorry about the hour.

108
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,235
I'll live. What's the rumpus?

109
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,320
Can I come in?

110
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,448
Sure.

111
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,795
TOM: Drink?
LEO: I wouldn't mind.

112
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:04,264
-I tried calling earlier.
-I got home late.

113
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:14,983
-Well, I'm sorry about the hour.
-Uh-huh.

114
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,622
Not bad.

115
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:34,210
-Better than the paint we sell.
-That it is. That it is.

116
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:42,385
-You thought about cutting Bernie loose?
-Can't do it, Tommy.

117
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,972
That's sort of why I'm...

118
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,061
-Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.
-Uh-huh.

119
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,063
I know you're thinking,
"What's new?"

120
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:59,778
-But the situation now, I'm worried.
-She can take care of herself.

121
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,363
-Maybe better than you can.
-What does that mean?

122
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,824
Want another one?

123
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,785
LEO:
No.

124
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,953
What does that mean?

125
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,542
-How far has she got her hooks into you?
-That's a hell of a question.

126
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:21,716
It's a grift. If she didn't need you
to protect her brother from Caspar,

127
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,345
you think she'd take
slow carriage rides with you?

128
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,933
That's the deal, isn't it? You protect
Bernie till Caspar cools down?

129
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,768
You're a prickly pear.

130
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,939
-What's wrong with that?
-Nothing. I don't blame her.

131
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:41,236
She sees the angle, you, she plays it.
She's a grifter, just like her brother.

132
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,241
From grifter parents and grandparents.
They'll spawn grifter kids.

133
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,203
Stop it. I don't like to hear
my friends run down.

134
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:55,250
-Friendship has nothing to do with it.
-You'd do anything to help friends.

135
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,837
Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.

136
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,924
You know all the angles.
Christ, better than anybody.

137
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,345
Maybe you're wrong about this.
You don't know what's in her heart.

138
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:14,060
If she's such an angel, why are you
looking for her at 4:00 a.m.?

139
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:21,442
-I put a tail on her this afternoon.
-Uh-huh.

140
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,988
I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around.

141
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:29,033
To keep her out of trouble.
Wasn't to spy.

142
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,453
I was worried. With Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

143
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,831
What did Rug say?

144
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,126
That's just it. Nothing.
He's disappeared.

145
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,713
So you've lost your lady friend
and her tail?

146
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,299
I guess it sounds pretty sorry.

147
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,677
Help me out.
I don't know where to look.

148
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,388
You know Rug's crowd and Verna's.

149
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,058
I'm worried, with the way things are
with Caspar.

150
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:59,898
You shouldn't be confronting Caspar.
You can't trade body blows with him.

151
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:04,110
I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

Okay, give me the needle.

155
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,594
I am a sap.

Thanks for the drink.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Who was that?

160
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,970
Leo.

161
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,180
He's looking for you.

162
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,808
Did you tell him I was here?

163
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,685
No.

164
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,149
Did you put in a good word
for my brother?

165
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,360
No.

166
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,739
-You said you would.
-I said I'd think about it.

167
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,034
What did you tell him?

168
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:43,042
-Did you see Rug Daniels last night?
-No.

169
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,336
What did you tell Leo?

170
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,298
I told him you were a tramp
and he should dump you.

171
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,013
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

-Mink.

-You got your hat back.
-What of it?

174
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,260
Nothing. It ain't my business.
Bernie wants to see you.

175
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,056
-I'm not made of glass.
-He's nervous in public.

176
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,476
He's nervous.
In the spot he's in, who wouldn't be?

177
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,854
He wants you to ask Leo to watch him.
Leo listens to you.

178
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,775
Not that Leo wouldn't help
the Shmatte anyway.

179
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,486
-I don't get it.
-What's to get?

180
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,698
-You're Dane's sycophant.
-I can have more than one friend.

181
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,327
I don't want Dane to know,
but a guy like Bernie?

182
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,080
For a sheeny, he has good qualities.

183
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,749
What's going on with you and Bernie?

00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,544
Nothing. We're friends.
You know, amigos.

185
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,921
You're a fickle boy, Mink.

186

If Eddie Dane finds out
you got another amigo,

187

-I doubt he's the understanding type.
-How's he gonna find out?

Hello, Tommy.

00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,150
You know O'Doole and the mayor.

192
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:16,154
I ought to. I voted for him
six times last May.

193
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,115
And that ain't the record either.

194
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:24,328
Verna turned up. She's downstairs.

-She say where she been?
-No. I didn't press her.

-You hear about Rug?
-Yeah, R.I.P.

They took his hair. Jesus, that's
strange. Why would they do that?

198
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,761
Maybe it was Injuns.

So you figure Caspar bumped Rug?

202
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,275
-It's pretty obvious, ain't it?
-Yeah? So, what's the plan?

203
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:59,071
Jump on the guinea with both feet.
Give him the lowdown.

204
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:05,828
Leo just reminded us that Mr. Caspar
operates several clubs in our city,

205
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,124
wherein the patrons imbibe rum
and play games of chance.

-They don't look happy about it.

-We do as we're told.

208

Stirring this up won't be good
for anyone. It'll mean killing.

209

-I can't just lay down to Caspar.
TOM: You could do worse.

Bernie is a small price
to pay for peace.

211
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,730
It's business.
A war will hurt everybody.

212
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,859
Bernie plays with fire,
he must deal with the consequences.

That ain't even the point anymore.

214
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,907
He pooped Rug.
The day I back down,

215
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,410
Caspar's welcome to this town
and my place.

216
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,956

-You did. You and Verna.

Caspar hasn't broken the rules.
Bernie and you have.

219
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,425
If you call a war,
you have more to lose than Caspar.

220
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,430
But more to beat him with!
We have faced worse odds!

221
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,017
Never without reason.
It helps to have one.

222
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:22,363
It's your call. My opinion used
to count for something around here.

-It's not Leo's debt.

-Afraid people may get the right idea?

He's honest and has a heart.

what happens to Bernie?

He's my brother.
I don't want him to get hurt.

603
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:39,775
I know you've been wise
to all of Leo's dumb ideas.

604
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:45,155
Only a matter of time. That's why we
didn't put the arm on you, only Leo.

605
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,742
Since you botched that hit,
I can only be so grateful.

606
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,829
That's brave,
little Miss Punching Bag.

607
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:56,542
-Okay, Eddie. Friends now, huh?
-Nuts.

608
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,880
-I guess you'll be looking for a job?
-I might be.

609
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,967
Got references?
Been to college?

610
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:10,097
We only take yeggs what's been
to college. Ain't that right, Dane?

611
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:16,895
I'm joking, of course. We know you can
be useful to us, a smart kid like you.

612
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,401
The man who walks behind the man and
whispers in his ear could be useful.

613
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,030
I can do plenty for you.
Can you get Leo off me?

614
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,743
Don't worry about Leo,
we got plans for him.

615
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,829
-Like what?
-Not so fast, Kaputnik.

616
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:38,459
He's trying to say there will
be time to talk about that.

617
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:42,171
We can table that for a later day.

618
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:46,967
See, the last time we jawed,
you gave me the high-hat.

619
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:54,141
I guess I'm saying you gotta put
something on the table first. Ante up.

620
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,895
-Where do we start?
-Hear that? All business.

621
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,732
I told you he was a good kid.
All business.

622
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:05,944
We could start with the Shmatte.
Where's the Shmatte?

623
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:09,406
-You could tell us that.
-The Royale, room 302.

624
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,077
-You might find Mink with him.
DANE: The hell you say.

625
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:17,706
Bernie and Mink are cozy as lice.
And it ain't just business.

626

-He's lying.
-Why would I?

This guy is all wrong.

628
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,839
Mink is clean and this clown
is a smart guy!

629
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,969
It's easy enough to find out, eh?

630
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,892
You find Mink,
you bring him back here.

631
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:41,105
You go with Frankie
and Tic-Tac to the Royale.

632
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:45,901
If Bernie's there, Frankie and Tic-Tac
will take care of him.

633
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,362
And if he's not there?

634
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:52,157
I'll sit facing the corner
in a funny hat.

-The boss wants you to do it.

You know how to do this?

then you put one in his brain.

They can't make us do this.

They can't make us change. We're not
muscle, Tom. I never killed anybody.

a chisel, that's all. It's my nature.

deserve to die. Do you think I do?

Dane's making excuses for him,

but I think you was right.
Mink and Bernie was in it together.

I think Mink heard that you bumped the
Shmatte and lit out. Son of a bitch!

-I told you so.

but that's all right.

You was a good sport
to bump the Shmatte.

723

-How do you know Mink skipped?
-Dane can't find him.

724
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:02,772
-So he says.
-Meaning what, exactly?

725
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:05,859
I didn't give it much thought
until now,

726
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:09,654
since a guy will say anything
when his number's up.

727
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:14,576
But before I bumped Bernie, he swore
that Dane and Mink set him up.

728
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,371
That they were the ones
who sold out your fix.

729
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:30,508
Well, like you say,
a guy will say anything.

730
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,346
So why isn't Eddie Dane here?

731
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:41,394
Well, he don't care for you, kid.
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

732
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:45,023
After you left,
he tried to sell me on a double-cross.

733
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:49,945
He says why don't we give you
the bump after we get the Shmatte?

734
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,990
But I figure a deal is a deal.
You're square with me,

735
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:57,452
you bump the Shmatte,
I hold up my end.

736
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:00,497
It's ethics. Everything above-board,

737
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:04,417
so everybody knows who's a friend,
who's an enemy.

So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me. We go back.

01:48:18,074 --> 01:48:23,454
Why didn't you say what you're up to?
I thought you'd really gone over.

1201
01:48:23,538 --> 01:48:27,041
Not that I didn't deserve it,
but you could've told me.

1202
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:30,711
Telling you would only have
queered things if...

1203
01:48:30,795 --> 01:48:33,797
There just wasn't any point.

1204
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:37,051
Yeah, I can see that.

1205
01:48:37,135 --> 01:48:40,221
It was a smart play all around.

1206
01:48:40,305 --> 01:48:45,309
-I guess you know I'm grateful.
-No need.

1207
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:53,317
I guess you picked that fight with me
just to tuck yourself in with Caspar?

1208
01:48:53,401 --> 01:48:57,238
I don't know. Do you always know
why you do things?

1209
01:48:57,322 --> 01:48:59,281
Sure I do.

1210
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:05,037
-It was a smart play.
-Fine.

1211
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:10,876
I'd do anything
if you'd work for me again!

1212
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:16,632
I know I can be pigheaded sometimes,
but damn it, so can you!

1213
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:21,554
I need you.
Things can be the way they were.

1214
01:49:21,638 --> 01:49:23,973
I know it. I just know it.

1215
01:49:24,849 --> 01:49:31,146
As for you and Verna, well,
I understand. You're both young.

1216
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:33,899
Damn it, I forgive you.

1217
01:49:33,984 --> 01:49:37,570
I didn't ask for that,
and I don't want it.

1218
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:46,078
Goodbye, Leo.

1219
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:49,715
