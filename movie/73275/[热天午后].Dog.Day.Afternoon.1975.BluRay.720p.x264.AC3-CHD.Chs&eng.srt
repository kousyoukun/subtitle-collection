00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:20,376
本片为真人真事，片中事件发生于…

2
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:24,972
1972年8月22日，纽约布鲁克林

3
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:48,834
<font color=#38B0DE>热天午后</font>

4
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,911
一定是总部来的
It has to be from downtown.

5
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,641
我们是可以处理，但是需要总部同意
It's handled through this office, but it requires downtown approval.

6
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,250
我不知道
I don't know.

7
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,353
有很多人都碰过
It has been submitted.

8
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:58,153
苏菲雅，你可否帮我一下忙？
Sylvia, can you help me with this?

9
00:04:58,725 --> 00:04:59,816
来了
Coming.

10
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,069
打烊了，你想进来？
Closing time. Going in?

11
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:21,473
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

12
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:34,887
你是经理？
You the manager?

13
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,716
继续讲你的电话
Keep talking like nothing was wrong.

14
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,888
我等下再回你电话
Let me call you back.

15
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:55,661
桑尼，我有不好的预感
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

16
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,571
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

17
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:03,107
或许我们应该拿小一点的武器
Maybe we should take something smaller.

18
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:08,912
你疯啦，枪都拿出来了
You crazy? He started already. He's got the gun out.

19
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,842
快去站在门边
Go on, go over by the door.

20
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,716
站到门边去
Get over by the door.

21
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:08,096
全都不准动
Freeze!

22
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:10,169
全都不准动，快点
-Nobody move! -Get over there!

23
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:14,268
离警报器远点
Get away from those alarms.

24
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,404
靠中间站
Now get in the center.

25
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:19,508
他要是敢动就打烂他的头
He moves, shoot him!

26
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,441
用枪指着他，站中间点
Put the gun on him! Get out in the center.

27
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,306
桑尼

28
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,911
我没办法，桑尼
I can't do it, Sonny.

29
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:29,511
什么！
I'm not going to make it.

30
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,179
我下不了手，桑尼

31
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:34,587
你在讲什么？快指着他
What? Put it on him.

32
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:36,193
我没办法，桑尼
I can't do it.

33
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,358
我操！沙尔
Fuck me! Sal!

34
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:43,297
干嘛？　　你在哪儿？他办不到
-What? -Where are you? He can't make it.

35
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:44,659
去他的，叫他滚
Fuck him. Let him go!

36
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:48,002
快啊，桑尼
Come on!

37
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,205
让他出去
All right, let him out.

38
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:53,969
让他出去　　　照着做，哈维
Do what the gentleman says.

39
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:55,801
让他出去
Let him out.

40
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:00,278
对不起，桑尼
I'm sorry.

41
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,281
该死
Shit!

42
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,978
别把车开走　　　那我怎么回家？
-Don't take the car. -How do I get home?

43
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:10,479
坐地铁，我们需要车
Take the subway. We need the car.

44
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,391
车钥匙给我
The keys!

45
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:16,158
对不起，桑尼
I'm sorry, Sonny.

46
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:17,796
把门锁上
All right, lock it.

47
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,134
他妈的
What?

48
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,898
那边桌子底下有个女孩
There's a girl under that desk over there.

49
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,884
他总算走了，现在可以办正事
We got rid of him. So now we just move it along.

50
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,145
听到了吗？
You got them?

51
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,222
他刚跟我说什么？
Now what did he say to me? Wait a minute.

52
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:51,517
谁躲在这里？这是什么，松鼠吗？
Anybody here? What's this, a squirrel?

53
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:52,684
喂…
Hey, you!

54
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,918
快点
Come on.

55
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:57,392
你出来站到后面去，没人会伤害你的
In the back there. No one's going to hurt you.

56
00:08:58,034 --> 00:08:59,557
快点，你站在后面去
Go ahead, get to the back.

57
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:01,723
把窗帘拉起来
Pull the drapes!

58
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,933
你站在后面去
You, to the back here.

59
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:11,041
到那边去
Go to him, right there.

60
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:15,101
速战速决，快！
We're going to move this now. Just move it along.

61
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:18,375
好
Gotcha!

62
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:23,073
速战速决，快！我们三十分钟内要完成
We're moving right along, folks. Going to get this thing done in half an hour.

63
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:25,350
我只是要…
We just got to block....

64
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:31,889
遮住监视器
Knock out the TV.

65
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:33,358
好了
There we go.

66
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,126
你看
See?

67
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,229
没录影也没警报器
No replay, folks. No alarms.

68
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,561
你们拿了东西可以走人了吧？
Let's get you fixed up and on your way.

69
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:42,432
金库开了没？　　这我来处理
-Is the vault open? -I can take care of that.

70
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:44,693
好，你来处理
Good. Let's go. Take care of it.

71
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,600
等一下，你在做什么？
Wait! What are you trying to do?

72
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,109
想启动警报器吗？用这把钥匙？
Trip the alarm? Use the spot key?

73
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,275
我一时忘了
I was out of my mind.

74
00:09:56,653 --> 00:09:57,949
听好
Get your mind right!

75
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,108
我是个天主教徒，我不想伤害任何人，懂吗？
I'm a Catholic. I don't want to hurt anybody!

76
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,152
是的，先生　　　不准按警报器
-Yes, sir. -No alarms.

77
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:04,982
不准按警报器
No alarms!

78
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,148
少玩把戏
No games.

79
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,617
用另一把钥匙
Use the other one.

80
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:12,125
玛莉安
Miriam...

81
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:13,824
把保险柜打开
...open the safe.

82
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,447
把钱放进袋子里
Put it in this.

83
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,088
怎样？
What?

84
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,663
只有这些
That's all there is.

85
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:56,935
你胡说什么？
What are you saying?

86
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:59,697
下午有人把钱收走了，这里只剩1100元
They picked it up today. There's only $1 ,1 00.

87
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,668
她说的是真的　　　别杀我
-It's true. -He'll shoot me!

88
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,931
我不敢相信
I can't believe it.

89
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:08,768
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it!

90
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,839
竟然会没有钱
There's no money here.

91
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:15,382
桑尼，快点拿钱　　　我在拿了…
-Come on, Sonny, let's do it! -I'm doing it!

92
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:19,546
怎么会这样？…
Too much! This is too much.

93
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:24,054
好了，我们走
All right, come on. Let's go.

94
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,687
电话，你去接，沙尔，看好他
You answer it. Watch him, Sal.

95
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,990
你跟我来
You, come with me. Watch him!

96
00:11:32,403 --> 00:11:35,166
坐下　　　谁是这儿的领班？
-Sit down. -Who's the head teller here?

97
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:36,426
是我
I am.

98
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:43,535
把这打开
Open it up.

99
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:48,375
不要全部拿
No, not all of it.

100
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,641
我在银行做过事，别以为我不知道警报器藏在哪
I worked in a bank. I know the alarms. All right?

101
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:53,546
别耍花招
Don't play games with me.

102
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,879
你得这样做
You take one of these, go like this...

103
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,747
先放进去再拿出来
...in here, and out it comes.

104
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,184
一百块就到手了
You got your 1 00.

105
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:01,488
我再回你电话
I'll call back.

106
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:05,560
不行，这张是废物，因为有记号
No, it's decoy money. It's marked.

107
00:12:06,165 --> 00:12:07,426
这是狗屎
It's shit.

108
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,030
看？
See?

109
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,726
高兴点，以后抢银行你就有经验了
Cheer up, you'll be the veterans of a robbery.

110
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:17,701
银行会给你一打玫瑰花的
You know the bank sends you a dozen red roses?

111
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,699
沙尔，叫经理接电话
Let him answer it.

112
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:25,401
嘿，经理，别打任何馊主意
Fucker! Don't get ideas.

113
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:27,569
我会叫，那边那个会咬
I bark, that man there...he bites!

114
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,012
相信我，我是你们这一边
I'm on your side.

115
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:30,241
我们这边？鬼才信
On my side, shit!

116
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,011
我们这有年轻的少女，请注意你说话的字眼
Listen, we got young girls here. You could watch your language.

117
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:39,720
我想说什么就说什么
I speak what I feel.

118
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:43,422
注意用词？清光那抽屉
Watch my language! Empty the drawer out.

119
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,126
我不知道，你可能要问他
You'd have to find out from him.

120
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,226
旅行支票
Traveler's checks...

121
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:51,961
还有登记簿
...and register.

122
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,130
登记簿
The register!

123
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,567
好了，走吧
You've got it. All right, let's go.

124
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,971
这我来拿
I'll take that from you.

125
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,104
沙尔，我们走吧
All right, Sal, here we go.

126
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:21,456
可恶
Come on.

127
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:28,501
桑尼，你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

128
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:30,896
我在烧登记簿
I'm burning the register here.

129
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:36,597
所有人往前走
Moving right along, folks.

130
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:41,475
我们要走了
We're leaving.

131
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,311
把钥匙给我
Let me have the keys.

132
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:45,178
哈维，把钥匙给他
Give him the keys.

133
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,782
我们不会伤害你的，我们要走了
Nobody will hurt you. We're going to leave.

134
00:13:58,763 --> 00:13:59,786
桑尼，那是谁？
Who's that?

135
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:03,591
他是对面的保险业务员，大概是看到烟了
The insurance guy from across the street. He probably saw the smoke.

136
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,031
请把火扑灭
Please, put out the fire.

137
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,183
我去拿水　　　站着别动
I'll get water.

138
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,288
Stay right there!

139
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,684
我待会儿回你电话　　　打发他！
-Call you later. -Get rid of him!

140
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:38,386
打发他！
Get rid of him!

141
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:50,670
别动歪脑筋，我来处理
-Use your head. -I can handle it.

142
00:14:58,216 --> 00:15:01,571
一切还好吧？　　没事，只是垃圾桶里的烟蒂
-Everything's all right? -Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.

143
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:05,917
你们没事
Then you're okay.

144
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,283
谢谢你帮我们留意　　　哪里
Thanks for keeping an eye out.

145
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,154
我们所有的钱都给你们了　　　好吧，我们走
-Go now. We gave you all we've got. -Okay, we're going.

146
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,730
接电话，沙尔
Answer the phone.

147
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,061
带他们去金库
Get them in the vault.

148
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,999
钱呢？　　我拿了
-Where's the money? -Getting it! Got it.

149
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:32,599
他要跟我们一起走
He'll come with us.

150
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:35,937
拜托别关门，我们还要呼吸
Don't close it. How can we breathe?

151
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:40,675
等一下，等一下
Wait a minute!

152
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,511
等一下　　　什么事？
-Wait. Listen. -What?

153
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,644
我撑不了的，我必须去厕所
I will never make this. I'll have to go to the toilet.

154
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:49,684
这不是开玩笑的
It's no joke.

155
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,019
我对幽闭恐惧症
I've got a terrible fear of being locked in.

156
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,792
好吧，还有谁要去？
Who needs the bathroom?

157
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:01,592
我也要去　　　现在变成全都要去了
I do too.

158
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,065
你可以检查看看
Now they all want to go.

159
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,256
Look, do you want to check it out?

160
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:07,237
在你右手边的第一间
It's the first door on your right.

161
00:16:09,745 --> 00:16:11,473
好吧，去吧
All right, mouth, let's go.

162
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,439
右手边的第一间
First door on my right.

163
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:18,645
她是玛丽亚
It's Maria!

164
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,780
我忘了她在这儿
I forgot she was in there.

165
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:25,717
这不是她的错，她常这样，她只有十分钟休息
She's always pulling this.

166
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,883
常常忘记…　　闭嘴，回去，全都不准去厕所
She should have 10 minutes, but--

167
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,240
Shut up! Nobody goes to the bathroom!

168
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:32,292
回去，快点　　　现在是银行抢劫
-Let's go. Out! -We're having a bank robbery.

169
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,254
我是马维尼…
Mulvaney speaking.

170
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:38,067
爱讲话的…
Mouth. Mouth!

171
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,157
这就充当你的马桶　　　你的电话
-Here's your toilet. -It's for you.

172
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:41,395
什么？
What?

173
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,466
电话是找你的
Phone.

174
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,466
真的
For you.

175
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:10,089
你在那里做什么？　　你是谁？
-What are you doing? -Who is this?

176
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:15,260
我是尤金摩瑞提探长，白痴，你们被包围了
Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti, asshole! We got you by the balls.

177
00:17:15,903 --> 00:17:17,927
不相信的话，看看窗外吧
I'm looking you right on the eye.

178
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,159
我看到你了
I can see you.

179
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,895
是谁？　　条子
-Who is it? -Cops.

180
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,286
把手放在头上走到前门
Come to the front door....

181
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,058
挂掉电话
Hang it up.

182
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:11,647
快点
Come on, let's go.

183
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:15,151
怎么会这样？
How'd that happen?

184
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:19,344
我有伤害你吗？我对你不好吗？
Did I do anything to hurt you? Did I treat you badly?

185
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,651
我的薪水不值得我当英雄　　　这次抢劫有计划吗？
I'm on salary. I won't be a hero.

186
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,813
Did you have a plan or what?

187
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:26,192
还是你只是突然决定的？
What did you do, barge in on a whim?

188
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,192
你为什么要点火？
Why light a fire?

189
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:32,195
早就叫你们离开了，不听我的话
I told you to get out...

190
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,530
...when you could, but you had to hang around.

191
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,931
他根本没有计划这次的行动　　　我有计划！
He don't have a plan. It's all a whim. Rob a bank!

192
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:40,006
只是我以为钱会被送来，而不是被收走
I had it planned!

193
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:40,162
Only the money should have been delivered, not taken away!

194
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:44,132
都是那个他妈的杰克，给的错误资讯
That fucking Jack, downtown, he gave me the wrong information.

195
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:48,339
杰克又是谁啊？幕后的策划人吗？
What is this Jack supposed to be? A mastermind or what?

196
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:52,906
我们有难同当，我们必须离开这里
We're all in the barrel together and we want to get out of it.

197
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:59,648
我需要时间思考，让我想想…
All right, I got to have time to think. I got to think.

198
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:20,436
仔细听好，靠近这里一步
Keep away or we'll start throwing bodies out the door, one at a time. Got that?

199
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,436
我就开始射杀人质一次一个，听到没？

200
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:27,605
你是谁？
Who is this?

201
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,585
有人叫珍妮吗？
Is there a Jenny here?

202
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:42,123
谁是珍妮？
Who's Jenny here?

203
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,624
我就是
That's me.

204
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:46,162
是你这松鼠，有没有先生？
It's the squirrel. You got a husband?

205
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:48,825
他在电话上
Well, he's on the phone.

206
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,161
接啊
Go ahead.

207
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,363
我要说什么？
What could I tell him?

208
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:56,464
我不知道，随便你说啊，告诉他详情
I don't know, whatever. Tell him the truth.

209
00:19:56,677 --> 00:19:59,770
真是他妈的闹剧，WNEW，热门音乐电台
What a fucking comedy! W-N-E-W plays all the hits.

210
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,502
听着，先别挂
Listen. Don 't hang up.

211
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:04,870
里面有人受伤吗？　　没有
-First, is anybody hurt in there? -No.

212
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:09,042
别靠近，不然我会一个个杀人质，听到吗？
Keep away or we'll start throwing bodies out, one at a time. You got that?

213
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:12,847
别，等一下，让我跟你聊聊，里面有几个人？
Don't. Let me talk to you for a while. How many people you got?

214
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:15,717
别问了，你再打给我，你等下再打给我
No, call me back.

215
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,674
Call me back.

216
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:20,087
他问你们几点会弄完？
He wants to know when you'll be through.

217
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:23,789
什么？拜托你，小姐
What? Girlie, please!

218
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,971
快上…
Come on. Let's go.

219
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,375
后门在哪儿？　　里面锁住了
-Where's the back door? -It's locked on the inside.

220
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,847
在哪儿？
Where is it?

221
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:47,213
走廊底的右边
Through the passageway to the right.

222
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:52,181
沙尔，掩护他们
Cover them!

223
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:55,619
你随便煮嘛，什么都可以
You could just go ahead and look whatever's there.

224
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:29,921
好，我会的，我会的
Oh, yes, I will. Yes, I will.

225
00:21:30,826 --> 00:21:33,350
喂，该挂了　　　亲爱的，我得挂了
-Let's go, come on. -Honey, I've got to go now.

226
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:35,554
我得挂了
I got to go.

227
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,353
我也爱你
I love you too.

228
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,496
现在待在这里面
All right, inside here.

229
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,559
我不知道发生什么事
I don't know what happened.

230
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,238
可能有人不小心触动警报器
Maybe somebody tripped an alarm or something. I don't know.

231
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,932
一定有办法逃出去的，放心好了
But there's a way out of this.

232
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,477
你说的是真的吗？　　什么是真的？
-Were you serious about what you said? -About what?

233
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,175
你真的要…

234
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,450
你真的要射杀人质？
About throwing those bodies out the door?

235
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:13,048
我只是放风声罢了　　　我只想确认一下
-That's what I want him to think. -I want to know what you think.

236
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:20,096
因为我已经准备好了
Because I'll tell you right now, I'm ready to do it.

237
00:22:20,736 --> 00:22:22,896
是吗？好吧
Right. Okay.

238
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:25,828
我是说真的　　　我知道
-I mean it. -I know.

239
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:32,138
所有人听着，我们现在出了点问题
Listen, everybody. I know we got a problem here.

240
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:35,142
但是别担心，很快就可以解决
But there's a way out of this thing. I'm telling you.

241
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:37,973
只要跟我们合作
All you got to do is cooperate with me.

242
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:42,880
保持镇定，快解决了，听话就不会有人受伤
Stay cool, and we'll get out of this.

243
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,947
Nobody gets hurt if you listen to me.

244
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:47,215
首先，一步一步来，你要去厕所对吧？
First, we'll do things a step at a time. You got to go to the bathroom, right?

245
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,152
她可以去
She'll get to go to the bathroom.

246
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:53,750
其他人也可以去，但我们要一起行动
Everybody who has to go is going. We'll do things together, okay?

247
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,893
保持镇静，他怎么了？
What's the matter with him?

248
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:00,896
他有气喘　　　气喘？
He's got asthma.

249
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,465
Asthma?

250
00:23:15,784 --> 00:23:17,546
我来处理
I'll take care of that.

251
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:19,411
你叫什么名字？
-You, what's your name? -Mulvaney.

252
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:20,814
马维尼　　　马维尼？

253
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:22,110
你跟我来
Come with me.

254
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,949
他有气喘你们还要他当警卫？　　他上过警校
-He's got asthma and he's a guard? -They go to guard school.

255
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,684
学怎么开枪吗？他连枪都没有
To learn how to shoot? He doesn't have a gun.

256
00:23:29,896 --> 00:23:32,989
他们早上升旗，一周可赚150元
They earn a $105 a week to fold the flag in the morning...

257
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,359
我不知道他们学什么
...straighten up. I don't know what they learn.

258
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:39,727
我要把门挡起来，以免他们冲进来
I want to block that door. In case they try coming in, I can hear it.

259
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:41,702
过来帮我
Let's move this.

260
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:48,206
等一下，等一下
Wait a minute. Hold it!

261
00:23:50,414 --> 00:23:51,778
先把这个拿走
Let's get rid of this.

262
00:23:57,987 --> 00:23:58,975
你有小孩吗？
You got kids?

263
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:01,519
两个，我还想见到他们
I got 2 kids and I'd like to see them again.

264
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,545
别担心，你会的，你一直都还蛮听话的
You'll see them again. You're being cooperative.

265
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,488
我对你没有任何抱怨…没有抱怨…
I got no complaints against you, whatsoever.

266
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,351
一点都没有
Whatsoever. You got bank insurance?

267
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:11,792
你有没有银行保险？　　你知道我有

268
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,365
你好像蛮清楚银行的事
You know I do. You seem to know a lot about bank procedure.

269
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:17,931
我还知道很多事
I know a lot of things.

270
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:24,701
我只是想让你们安全离开，不是吗？
I just want to get you out of here safe, right?

271
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:27,906
如果我要你跟我走？
What if I take you with me?

272
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:29,876
如果你要带人的话
If you take anybody...

273
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:31,739
就选我吧
...please take me.

274
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:33,941
他们会开枪射你，你知道？
They'll shoot you, you know?

275
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,514
警察
The cops...

276
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:39,611
他们根本不在乎银行什么保险，看看亚提卡…
...don't care about bank insurance. See what they did in Attica?

277
00:24:39,957 --> 00:24:43,778
他们杀了42人，不管有罪无罪…
42 people killed. The innocent with the guilty.

278
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:46,485
总之放心

279
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:52,395
我不会选你的，我要选女人
I won't take you. I'll take one of the girls, a married one with kids.

280
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:54,329
结婚有小孩的

281
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:57,391
警察要是杀了她们，见报就不好看了
Cops don't like it in the papers when they shoot a married woman with kids.

282
00:24:57,573 --> 00:24:58,664
尤其是有小孩的

283
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,899
你还不错
You're all right.

284
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,441
你不会跟我玩把戏吧
You won't fuck with me?

285
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:38,165
调查局的人来了
There's the FBI.

286
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:43,301
你好吗，沙登？
How you doing, Sheldon?

287
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,226
你为什么不等他们出来呢？
Why didn't you wait and try to take them outside?

288
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:09,994
我判断错误
An error in judgment.

289
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:13,658
我以为他们看到警察、听到被包围会吓破胆
Thought the S.O.S would be remorseful at the sight of a policeman.

290
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:14,929
而且…
And you know something?

291
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,638
没人提及里面有人质
Nobody said "hostage" yet, okay?

292
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,037
发生抢案了
We got a bank robbery here.

293
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,376
记者是怎么突破封锁线的？
How did the press guys get through the barrier?

294
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:37,988
这次的银行抢案没有任何资讯
We don't know what's up yet. We're setting up communications.

295
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:41,684
我是CBS的布莱恩，请问现场的状况如何？
This is Ron Cummins from CBS. Can you tell me the situation?

296
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:46,761
我们在架设通讯设备，嫌犯在里面
We're setting up communications. Our perpetrators are in the bank.

297
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:48,525
我只能说那么多
That's all I can say now.

298
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,101
有什么我会再跟你们说
When I get it, you'll get it. That's all.

299
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:56,298
你们在逃生梯那儿干嘛？我是说屋顶
What are you doing on the fire escape?

300
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:58,364
快上屋顶，可以吗？
I said on the roof. Get up on the roof, will you?

301
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:49,846
叫电信局了吗？　　全架设完毕
-Get the phone company? -Setting it up now.

302
00:27:50,057 --> 00:27:52,479
这支电话能直接与银行里的人通话
This phone is going to be a direct line into the bank.

303
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:02,191
我是马维尼　　　我是摩瑞提，让我跟他说话
-Mulvaney speaking. -Moretti here. Let me talk to him.

304
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,860
什么事？　　我是尤金摩瑞提探长
This is Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti.

305
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:12,502
现在你们在里面，我们在外面，要怎么办
You're there, we're here. What do we do?

306
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:14,901
我不知道怎么办
I don't know. What do we do?

307
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:17,233
首先，我想知道人质都安全吧
Are the people in the bank okay?

308
00:28:17,715 --> 00:28:18,840
是的
They're okay.

309
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:22,970
你自己一个人还是有同伙？　　我不是一个人
-You alone or you got confederates? -I'm not alone.

310
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:28,076
还有沙尔　　　沙尔？全名是沙尔瓦多？
I got Sal.

311
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,083
What's that for, Salvatore?

312
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:29,756
沙尔是个杀手
He's a killer.

313
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:33,455
我们参加过越战，杀人对我们来说小事一桩
We're Vietnam veterans. Killing don't mean anything to us.

314
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:35,656
军队里？　　对
-In the army? -Yeah.

315
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,659
你叫什么名字？
So you, what's your name?

316
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:40,092
你为什么要知道我的名字？
Why do you want to know my name?

317
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:42,856
我想有个名字称呼你
Just so I got something to call you.

318
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:54,705
只是给个名字不会怎样的
Let's be reasonable, okay? Just give me your name.

319
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:58,410
叫我桑尼吧　　　桑尼
Call me Sonny.

320
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,607
听好，桑尼
Listen, Sonny.

321
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:03,648
我想确认人质的安全　　　嗯
I want to see if the people are okay.

322
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,714
然后我想要跟你商量释放人质的事
Right.

323
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,373
Then I want to work out a way to get them out.

324
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:09,313
等一下我会不带枪进去里面
I want to come over without a gun.

325
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:12,719
你可以搜我身，取得你的信任之后
Frisk me so you'll trust me. We'll find a way out of this.

326
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:14,451
好
I just want to find some way that I can trust you too.

327
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:18,430
好的，那我该怎么相信你呢？要公平嘛，对不对？

328
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:21,425
我可不想被枪扫射而死
Not be on the street where you could shoot me.

329
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,002
一些信号？　　没错，像什么？
-Some sign, right? -Right. Like what?

330
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:26,096
放人质出来如何？
Let the people out.

331
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,970
等一下，你以为我是他妈的白痴啊？
Who do you think you're dealing with? A fucking idiot here?

332
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:32,508
我才不会放我的护身符出去
They're keeping me alive. Let them out?

333
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:36,602
干嘛不跟我谈，有话直说　　　好吧，好吧
Talk to me. Just talk to me straight. I'm ready to talk.

334
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,477
那你把女的放出来
Give us the women?

335
00:29:38,752 --> 00:29:41,140
不行，我这儿就只有女的
No, I've got women. That's all I've got.

336
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:43,809
那就放其中一个
Give me something. Give me one of them.

337
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:46,247
你要一个干什么？　　公平交易啊
-One? -It's like a fair exchange.

338
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:50,384
我不会带武器进去，但不会把我当人质吧？
I'll come over. I won't pack nothing, don't know if you'll take me hostage.

339
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:52,058
表示咱们互相信任嘛
It's a sign of trust.

340
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:55,526
我怎么跟你连络？　　拿起电话就可以跟我通话
-How do I call you back? -It's a direct line.

341
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,722
拿起电话就可以跟我通话
Pick up the receiver and I'm here.

342
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:01,267
他要一个人
He wants one.

343
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,566
他，好吗？　　当然好
Him, right?

344
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:07,766
Right!

345
00:30:08,345 --> 00:30:10,437
可以吗？　　好

346
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:11,702
他出去
He goes.

347
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:19,144
对方到底是何方神圣？
What are we dealing with here?

348
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:23,479
你一定要这样跟着我吗？
You have to keep checking me out all the time?

349
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:25,149
是的
Yeah.

350
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,224
他需要钥匙
He'll need the keys.

351
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:33,925
你有吗？
Got the keys?

352
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,860
给他那一支就好，桑尼　　　好啦
Just the one, Sonny!

353
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,781
别开枪，别开枪
Don't fire!

354
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:56,179
你们在干嘛？
What are you doing?

355
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:59,250
他是人质耶，让他走
That's a hostage!

356
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,051
别开枪
Don't fire!

357
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:03,449
别开枪
Hold your fire!

358
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,546
我们决定让他先出来
We voted to send him out!

359
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:08,958
他是人质之一！　　放开他！
-He's one of the hostages! -Get away from him!

360
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:11,627
你们怎么搞的　　　他是人质之一
He's a hostage!

361
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,257
他是人质之一，放开他，你们这是干嘛？

362
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:15,584
What the hell's the matter with you?

363
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,093
我才不管！离远点！离开
I don't give a fuck! Get out of here.

364
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:22,131
别挡路，桑尼！等一下
Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute!

365
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,032
桑尼！这就是你的不对
That was your fault, Sonny.

366
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:27,768
我们之间不是有电话吗？
We had the communications set up here.

367
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:30,369
我们有250个警察在外面
We're not set up properly, with 250 cops here.

368
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:32,674
我们不知道，你在里面干什么！
We don't know what goes on in there.

369
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:35,341
你差点把他杀了，你疯啦！
-You almost killed him! Are you crazy? -That was smart!

370
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,148
真聪明　　　别落井下石，不是说全是女的？
You say you got nothing but women, and throw out a guy. What's going on?

371
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:41,348
干嘛又放一个男的出来？你搞什么鬼啊！

372
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,551
你不是要人质吗？我给你　　　你要不要合作？
You wanted a hostage, I gave you one.

373
00:31:44,962 --> 00:31:47,293
你要一个人质我就给你一个，不是吗？
-Are you going to deal with us or not? -I gave you one.

374
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:51,092
但你可以先用电话沟通嘛，出来吧，桑尼
You did, but you should have picked up the phone! Come on out.

375
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:53,694
我没有带任何武器
I ain't packing nothing, see?

376
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,727
没带任何武器，来搜啊，你一看就知道了

377
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:58,669
You can come out and frisk me. You can tell.

378
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,298
你要我出去？　　来，我知道你想出来看看…
-Why? -To take a look at something.

379
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:07,205
我要你知道对手是谁？　　我看得到为何要出去？
-To see what you're up against. -I can see. Why come out?

380
00:32:07,449 --> 00:32:09,245
你出来看啊
Come out and see it all.

381
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:10,605
来嘛

382
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:12,543
好不好？

383
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,211
我这有沙尔顾着人质，如果我出事他会知道的
Sal is in there with the other people. Anything happens to me, they'll get it.

384
00:32:18,392 --> 00:32:21,189
我没忘记他，你就出来看嘛
I don't forget about Sal. Come out and look.

385
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:23,953
出来嘛，好不好？

386
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:27,388
我要先跟他说　　　好吧，你不用带枪出来
-I got to check with him first. -You don't need that artillery.

387
00:32:35,173 --> 00:32:37,663
桑尼，跟他说只有五分钟
5 minutes. You tell him that.

388
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:40,102
别紧张
Take it easy.

389
00:32:40,945 --> 00:32:43,435
卡门，叫他们退后，他举白旗了
Get them back. He's got a white flag.

390
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:47,405
一切都还好
Everything's okay.

391
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:50,911
出来啊，桑尼
Come on out.

392
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:54,310
他们太靠近了　　　退后，妈的，你们在做什么？
He's too close here.

393
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,142
Get back! What the fuck are you doing?

394
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:57,420
退后！退后！可以吗？　　叫他们退后

395
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,582
出来啊，你过来看看
Come on out.

396
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,050
来啊，你看
Take a look at this.

397
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:04,353
看上面那边
Here, look! Look up here.

398
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,924
还有那边
Over here.

399
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,333
还有那边，我们应有尽有
Over there, right? We got everything here, okay?

400
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:36,524
整个军队都出动了啊？
You got the militia here.

401
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,062
叫沙尔也出来看看吧！
Let Sal come look. What hope have you got?

402
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,293
看看我们有些什么

403
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,396
见好就收吧
Quit while you're ahead.

404
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,661
趁现在只是企图抢劫而已　　　持枪抢劫
-It's only attempted robbery. -Armed robbery.

405
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:54,967
好啦，持枪抢劫
All right, armed, then! Nobody's been hurt.

406
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:56,302
但没有人受伤

407
00:33:56,577 --> 00:33:57,873
你把人质放了
Release the hostages. No one will worry over kidnapping charges.

408
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,542
不会被加上绑架的罪名

409
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,580
最多判五年，但一年就可以假释了　　　亲我
At the most you'll get 5 years. You'll get out in 1 .

410
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:05,416
什么？　　亲我
-What? -Kiss me.

411
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:08,080
当我被耍时，我需要有人亲我
When I'm being fucked, I like to get kissed on the mouth.

412
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:10,652
别这样嘛…　　你是市内的警察吧？
You're a city cop, right? Bank robbery's a federal offense.

413
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:15,779
抢银行犯法，他们会以绑架、持枪抢劫起诉我

414
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:16,390
They got me on kidnapping, armed robbery. They'll bury me.

415
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:19,283
我才不跟要想耍我的人讲话，叫负责人出来
I won't talk to somebody trying to con me. Get someone in charge.

416
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:23,024
我就是　　　我不要跟你这死肥猪谈判
I won't talk to some flunky pig trying to con me. What's he doing?

417
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:25,131
他在干嘛？　　退后！你们靠近干嘛？
-Get back! -Why are they moving in?

418
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:29,500
他们一直靠近是怎样！　　你们退后！退回去！
Will you get the fuck back there?

419
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:31,867
回去！　　退回去！
Get over there!

420
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:35,135
退回去！　　他很想尝尝杀我的滋味
Go on back there, man!

421
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:35,284
He wants to kill me so bad!

422
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:37,767
我们不杀任何人　　　亚提卡…
-No one's going to kill anybody. -Attica!

423
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:41,905
亚提卡…
Attica!

424
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:55,618
别忘了亚提卡事件！
Remember Attica!

425
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:03,092
你们说话跟放屁一样！
Your word don't fucking matter!

426
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,997
冷静点！
Come on, calm down.

427
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,098
把枪放下
Put your guns down!

428
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,775
如果不是有记者，我们早就被杀光了
Without the TV guys, they'd kill us all!

429
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:20,475
叫他们把枪放下！
Put your guns down!

430
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:25,852
他妈的，把枪放下

431
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,314
枪放下
Put them down!

432
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:31,451
把枪放下
Put them down!

433
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:41,895
亚提卡
Attica!

434
00:35:53,146 --> 00:35:55,773
就是这样！这样才对嘛…
You got it, man!

435
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:16,030
抢银行？
Robbing a bank?

436
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:21,891
他为什么不跟我说他要钱？
Why didn't he tell me he needed money?

437
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:26,295
他应该跟我说的
He should have come to me if he needed money.

438
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:34,800
据了解，现在里面有8名人质
We know that 8 people are still being held on the bank.

439
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:39,043
我们对里面的状况完全不清楚
The situation inside the bank is totally unknown to us other than...

440
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:43,040
除了被释放人质哈维卡文所提供的描述以外外
...descriptions that have been obtained from Howard Calvin.

441
00:36:43,223 --> 00:36:45,452
你妈是个吸金女，干嘛还抢银行？
Why steal when your mom's a sucker?

442
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:49,890
现在将镜头带到布鲁克林现场
We'll switch you now to Ron Cummons at the bank on Brooklyn.

443
00:36:50,063 --> 00:36:52,485
班森小姐，请问里面情况如何？
Miss Benson, what's it like inside?

444
00:36:52,664 --> 00:36:55,518
能说什么？就是抢劫嘛！他们在里面
They're holding up, what can I say?

445
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:56,893
有共识了吗？　　叫沙尔的人…
Got a deal?

446
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:59,024
拿着枪，不太说话
The guy with the gun on us is a quiet type.

447
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:01,364
你们相信摩瑞提探长吗？
Any confidence in Detective Moretti?

448
00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:05,326
他们不知道摩瑞提探长…我得走了
They don't know Detective Moretti yet. I got to go now.

449
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,300
你抓我手干嘛？
What's this with the hands?

450
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:10,269
她都出来了…
She's out, let her stay.

451
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:14,041
别进去…　　大家都在里面，我要进去
They're my girls. I'm going back in there.

452
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,680
哈维还好吧？　　他没事了
-Howard. How is he? -Howard's all right.

453
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,227
把电视打开　　　女孩们…
Put the TV on.

454
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,727
我被访问了
Girls, I was interviewed!

455
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:34,496
讲好了！　　不错嘛！
Looks good.

456
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,997
几乎所有人跟媒体都在外面　　　是电视台…
The media's there.

457
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:39,797
干嘛？　　电视台记者想访问你…
TV people.

458
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:39,343
TV people.

459
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:42,529
他们在外面
They want to talk to you.

460
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,276
什么事？　　桑尼，我们现正在实况转播
Hello, Sonny. You're on the air.

461
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,341
你介意回答我们几个问题吗？　　不
Would you answer a few questions for us?

462
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:58,243
你为什么要这么做？
Why are you doing this?

463
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:03,820
哈？　　你看
Hello?

464
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,914
没事，我看到我自己了，你刚刚问…
I just saw myself there.

465
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:07,855
我为什么要这么做？　　是的
Why am I doing it?

466
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:10,825
做什么？　　抢银行
-Doing what? -Robbing a bank.

467
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:18,198
我不懂你为什么问
I don't know what you mean by that.

468
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:21,569
我抢银行是因为这里有钱　　　你误会了…
I'm robbing a bank because they got money here.

469
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:24,130
我是说你为什么想要抢钱？
I mean, why do you feel you have to steal for money?

470
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:25,572
你不能工作赚钱吗？
Couldn't you get a job?

471
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:29,811
不行，要做什么？
No. Doing what?

472
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:34,573
你知道吗？你若要工作，就必须是工会的一员
You know, if you want a job, you got to be a member of a union.

473
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:38,579
没有工会卡，也没有工作
If you got no union card, you don't get a job.

474
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,553
那不是工会的工作呢？
What about non-union jobs?

475
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:44,754
他搞不清楚状况啊？
What's wrong with him?

476
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:47,917
什么叫不是工会的工作？银行出纳员吗？
What do you mean non-union? Like what, a bank teller?

477
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:52,861
你知道他们一周赚多少？不多，起薪115元，对吧？
You know how much a bank teller makes? Not much.

478
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,000
$115 to start, right?

479
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:54,229
你要怎么过活？
You can live on that?

480
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:57,725
我老婆和两个小孩要怎么活？
I got a wife and kids. How am I to live on that? What do you make a week?

481
00:38:58,442 --> 00:39:01,399
你一周赚多少？　　我是来跟你谈有关…
-I'm here to talk to you, Sonny. -Yeah, I'm talking to you.

482
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,940
嗯，我在跟你说话

483
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:06,602
我们是娱乐，对吧，你有什么好处给我们？
We're entertainment, right? What do you got for us?

484
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:08,872
你想要好处干嘛？
What do you want to get for it?

485
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:13,246
你想拿钱…？　　我不想，也不需要，你听着
-Do you expect to be paid? -I don't need to be paid.

486
00:39:13,455 --> 00:39:17,413
我和同伴还有其他9人，我们就快要死了
I'm here with my partner and 9 other people. See, we're dying!

487
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:20,717
我们就要血溅五步，肝脑涂地
You're going to see our brains on the sidewalk.

488
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:26,024
你会停播新闻，然后插播这个给妇孺观众看吗？
You'll show that on TV?

489
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:26,242
Have housewives see that? Instead of "As The World Turns"?

490
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,292
你可以给我什么？总得有些回馈　　　桑尼…
What do you got for me? I want something for that.

491
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:32,430
你可以放弃　　　放弃？
-You could give up. -Give up?

492
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,867
你去过监狱没？　　没有
-You ever been in prison? -No.

493
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,065
没有？那我们来谈你他妈知道的事吧！
No! Let's talk about something you fucking know about.

494
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:42,372
你一周赚多少？　　很抱歉通讯突然中断
-How much you make a week? -Transmission has been interrupted.

495
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:46,675
我们很快会再带您回现场　　　喂？哈？
Please stand by, we will return to our special news cast very soon.

496
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,873
他妈的到底搞什么鬼？喂？
Hello? What the fuck happened?

497
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,711
我想他们不喜欢你的用词
Guess he disliked your language.

498
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:56,652
去他的，干
Fuck him!

499
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:08,492
沙尔

500
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:26,942
他们很可能会跟我们谈判
I don't know, they might deal with us.

501
00:40:28,453 --> 00:40:31,444
外面那个人怎样我不清楚
I don't know about that guy out there.

502
00:40:31,756 --> 00:40:36,419
如果我把调查局扯进来，他们说不定肯谈判
But if I get the FBI involved in this, they might deal.

503
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:38,216
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

504
00:40:49,005 --> 00:40:50,266
沙尔？　　不行！

505
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:55,029
你怎么了？　　你不是答应过我什么吗？
What's wrong?

506
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:55,581
You made a promise, didn't you? Did you promise me something?

507
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,303
你是不是说“不成功，便成仁”
Did you say either we get away clean or we kill ourselves?

508
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,573
你是不是说过？　　我现在不是说那个
-Did you? -I'm not talking about that.

509
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:05,544
你要不要遵守诺言？我们还做不做？
Do you believe in keeping your promises? Does it still go?

510
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,141
当然　　　那你又在说些什么东西？
Yes.

511
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,093
What are you talking about?

512
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:13,883
我绝不回监狱
I won't go back to prison.

513
00:41:20,165 --> 00:41:21,722
把他们全杀死，现在！
Kill them all now.

514
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:24,788
用刺刀把他们全杀死！　　去你的
-Take your bayonet, jam it into their-- -Fuck you!

515
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,931
我们要架飞机，如何？
We ask for a jet. What do you think?

516
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:14,005
我们要架直升机
We get a helicopter.

517
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:17,636
叫直升机开到屋顶上
We get a helicopter here, it lands on the roof...

518
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:23,407
再带我们去坐飞机，我们可以飞离这个国家
...and takes us to a jet. And we fly the fuck out of the country.

519
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:25,412
沙尔？

520
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,678
沙尔？

521
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:29,817
我们办得到！
We can do it.

522
00:42:34,564 --> 00:42:36,360
沙尔，沙尔？

523
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,525
我们有王牌，我们根本不知道…
We got them. We don't even know it.

524
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:41,232
我们有人质
We've got the hostages.

525
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:45,599
我们从一开始就做错了，我们可以提要求
We've been looking at this the wrong way. We make the demands!

526
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:48,065
他们一定会给我们要的东西
They'll give us what we want.

527
00:42:54,514 --> 00:42:57,846
我要去热带国家，再也不用忍受下雪天
I'm flying to the tropics. Fuck the snow!

528
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:05,121
嘿，大嘴巴在哪里？
Where's the mouth?

529
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:10,949
一起去阿尔及利亚？　　阿尔及利亚？好啊
-You ready to go to Algeria? -Algeria? Yeah, sure!

530
00:43:11,129 --> 00:43:12,925
我们要去气候晴朗的地方！
We're all going to sunny climes!

531
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:16,020
沙尔，我办得到！
I can make it happen!

532
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:20,063
我已经撑了这么久，我办得到！
I've made it happen so far.

533
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,351
I can make it happen.

534
00:43:28,511 --> 00:43:30,740
帮我接摩瑞提　　　探长…
Give me Moretti.

535
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:36,275
所有的人都去打电话吧，打个电话回家报备
All of you, go ahead, make calls. Call home or whatever.

536
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:37,947
我们要去旅行
We're going on a trip.

537
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:40,776
是的，桑尼？　　我有话跟你说
I want to talk to you.

538
00:43:40,954 --> 00:43:44,116
我要出来　　　非常好，我会在外面等你
-I'm coming out. -Good, I'll be there.

539
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,287
走吧，他要出来了
Let's go, he's coming out.

540
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,123
现在，你要了解状况
You must understand something.

541
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:54,161
一旦离开就不能回头
If we leave the country, there's no coming back here.

542
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:56,533
你知道我说什么吧？不能回头！
There's no coming back.

543
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:59,067
想要跟谁说话
If there's anyone you want to talk to...

544
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,662
想要跟谁说再见的话，要快
...you want to say goodbye to, do it now.

545
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,069
没有
No.

546
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,942
你有想去的国家吗？
Is there any special country you want to go to?

547
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:17,582
怀俄明
Wyoming.

548
00:44:19,888 --> 00:44:22,685
那里不行，那不是个国家
No, Wyoming.... That's not a country.

549
00:44:23,992 --> 00:44:26,221
没关系，我来处理
That's all right. I'll take care of it.

550
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:51,339
放下！听到没？
Put them down!

551
00:44:55,086 --> 00:44:57,349
放下！听到没？看，我什么也没带
Put them down! You hear that? What do I have?

552
00:44:58,256 --> 00:45:01,747
这里也没有，要不要看我的袖子？
See this here, look! I got nothing up my sleeve!

553
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:05,849
这里也没有，要不要看我的口袋？
I got nothing here either! Want to see my pockets? Here!

554
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:07,825
你不敢不带枪吧？
You need that gun, right!

555
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:13,125
摩瑞提，叫他们把枪放下
Moretti! Tell them to put their guns down!

556
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:16,892
嘿，你！看不懂吗？把枪放回枪袋去！

557
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,467
Put it in your holster!

558
00:45:21,777 --> 00:45:23,471
把枪放下！
Put the guns down!

559
00:45:25,646 --> 00:45:29,001
懂吗？把枪放下！那是什么？
You know what it means to put a gun down? What's this?

560
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:30,810
那是什么？

561
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:34,574
谢谢！这就对了！
Right! Thank you very much!

562
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:36,277
感激万分

563
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:38,149
你们终于开窍了
You got it, right?

564
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:42,349
你们终于开窍了，嘿，摩瑞提
You got it, baby! Hey, Moretti!

565
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:44,490
都是你帮我的
You made it happen!

566
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:51,557
玛利亚在里面
You got Maria in there!

567
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:55,665
玛利亚！

568
00:45:57,207 --> 00:46:01,131
他里面有枪！玛利亚…
He's got a gun in there!

569
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:04,035
玛利亚，玛利亚…

570
00:46:05,714 --> 00:46:07,305
把他带走
Get him the fuck out of here!

571
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,573
老天啊！　　怎么会这样？

572
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,855
How the hell did that happen?

573
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:13,380
我有沙尔在里面　　　别紧张，别紧张
-I got Sal in there! -Take it easy!

574
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:14,680
通知管区警察
Notify the precinct.

575
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,413
他是谁？
Who the fuck is that?

576
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:20,121
只是个西班牙小孩　　　玛利亚又是谁？
One of them Spanish kids.

577
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:23,657
她被你关…　　沙尔要见桑尼，不然就要开枪了
-Who's Maria? -She's inside.

578
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,951
Sal wants to see Sonny, says he'll shoot unless he does!

579
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:27,156
他是认真的，桑尼，他是认真的！　　沙尔…
He's serious! Sonny, he means it!

580
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:29,791
没关系，没关系
It's all right.

581
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:32,469
没事了

582
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,395
对不起　　　怎么发生的？
-I'm sorry. -How'd that happen?

583
00:46:37,576 --> 00:46:40,066
他女朋友是人质之一，你没事吧
You got his girlfriend in there. You okay?

584
00:46:40,212 --> 00:46:42,133
他想杀我
That fuck tried to kill me.

585
00:46:42,314 --> 00:46:45,771
他打了你好几下　　　我被打了好几下
-You look all squeezed out. -I am squeezed out!

586
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,315
让我看看你的头
Let me see your head, all right?

587
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:50,850
我在流血！　　让我看看…
-I'm bleeding! -Let me see it.

588
00:46:58,194 --> 00:47:01,549
还好，你想跟我说什么？
It's all right. You want to talk to me about something?

589
00:47:02,097 --> 00:47:03,825
刚有个人打电话来
Should've heard that phone call.

590
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:06,458
一个疯子打来说，要杀死所有的人
Some creep calls up and says, "Kill everybody. "

591
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:08,763
每个人都想杀死所有的人
Everyone wants to kill everyone.

592
00:47:08,936 --> 00:47:12,359
这种人到处都会有的，对吧　　　对啊
I think you're going to get assholes like that any how, right?

593
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,571
跟你说…我有个提议
I want to talk to you. I got an offer.

594
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,370
我想要一架直升机
I want a helicopter.

595
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:27,313
还要可以带我去任何国家的飞机
And a jet to go wherever I want to go.

596
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,918
所以小的不行，要大的那一种
So I don't want a little jet, I want a big one.

597
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:33,353
有酒吧和钢琴的那种，我很可能会离开国家
One with a bar, a piano. Maybe I want to leave the country.

598
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:37,318
我不知道直升机是否能来这儿
I don't know whether a helicopter would fit in here or not.

599
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:40,055
我帮你查查看吧　　　可以停在屋顶上
I'll check it.

600
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:43,857
不行，上面是柏油，停上去会垮的
-It could land on the roof. -That's asphalt, it'll break through.

601
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:46,494
让我打电话问我上司好吗？
I'll call my superiors, you understand?

602
00:47:46,803 --> 00:47:48,963
让我…　　那干嘛不叫你上司来呢？
Why not bring your superiors here?

603
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:52,163
让我直接跟他们谈，就不必透过你了
Why am I talking to you if you got to call superiors?

604
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,202
我们有分歧　　　对，所以我要跟他们说
-We don't always see eye-to-eye. -Yeah, so I'll talk to them.

605
00:47:56,344 --> 00:47:57,742
我会打电话问问他们怎么说
I'll see what they say.

606
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,602
我和他们谈谈，还有其他的要求吗？
I'll talk to them and ask them, all right?

607
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:02,861
Anything else I can get you?

608
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:08,875
我要你把我太太带来这儿
I want you to bring my wife down here.

609
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:12,754
好，那你要给我们什么？　　你要什么？
-What do you give us? -What do you want?

610
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:14,790
女人质
The women hostages.

611
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:18,183
老天啊，跟你说话真累
There's no talking to you!

612
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:21,328
不是说过吗？里面全是女的
I told you, that's all I got in there is women.

613
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,832
你到底要不要谈判啊？
You going to talk to me or what?

614
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,496
你答应我一个要求，我给一个人质
I give one hostage for each thing you give me, see?

615
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:33,836
给我直升机放一个人质，给我飞机再放一个
The helicopter for a hostage. The jet for a hostage.

616
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:38,171
带我太太来给你一个，其他人用飞机送回家
You give me my wife, I give you a hostage.

617
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:38,897
Then the rest come home on the jet.

618
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:43,376
我看他们能怎么做好吗？
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

619
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:46,576
在这段期间你赶快选人质
In the meantime, pick out who you want to give us.

620
00:48:46,855 --> 00:48:49,550
还有你太太在哪里？
And tell me where your wife is, all right?

621
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:54,182
我坐在这儿管我自己的事，我听到桑尼抢银行
I'm here minding my own business, I hear the transistor go "Sonny what?"

622
00:48:54,362 --> 00:48:56,386
我真不敢相信，我抱起孩子就跑
I can 't believe my ears! I grab the kids!

623
00:48:56,564 --> 00:49:00,329
我告诉你那个抢银行的人，绝对不是桑尼
I'm telling you, Sonny didn't do it. It ain't him to rob a bank!

624
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,094
桑尼绝不会伤害，或威胁任何人…
It ain't him to steal or hurt anybody or do nothing wrong!

625
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:07,000
从我认识他到现在，他从没做过坏事
He's never done wrong since the day I know him!

626
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:09,595
前天晚上，我们在康尼岛时
Night before last we're at Coney Island. I see he keeps a loaded gun on the car!

627
00:49:09,775 --> 00:49:13,335
发现他买了一把有子弹的枪

628
00:49:13,512 --> 00:49:16,139
我现才知道，他的行为有多么疯狂
Things are adding up how crazy he's acting lately...

629
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:19,878
都是受坏朋友的影响　　　我就看着他
...and in with a bad crowd. So I look at him.

630
00:49:20,118 --> 00:49:22,881
到床上去，他像疯了似的一直骂小孩
Get in bed. He's yelling at the kids like a madman.

631
00:49:23,154 --> 00:49:26,509
然后他突然叫我带小孩去玩，我不想去
Then he wants me to go in a kiddie ride. I don't want to go.

632
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,214
他就一直吼，乖，宝贝，嘘…
He starts screaming at me.

633
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:32,480
一直吼个不停
He's screaming and screaming.

634
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,787
在车里我问他，桑尼，你要那把枪干嘛？
I say, "What are you going to do with the gun?"

635
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:37,727
不会是杀我，把尸体丢到河里吧？
Shoot me and dump me in the river?

636
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,991
我当时好害怕，我从不怕他的
I was scared of him. I never been scared of him.

637
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:45,066
他妈妈说我们一天到晚打架，还惊动警察
His mother says we always fought. The cops was always at our house.

638
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,366
有一次我在车子里，想用千斤顶打他
I hit him with a jack handle once in the car.

639
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:51,403
却打到我自己
I didn't even hit him. I hit myself.

640
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:53,772
全身到处都是瘀伤
You should've seen the bruise on my leg.

641
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:57,236
他却只穿上衣服戴帽子出门去
He'd put on his hat and coat, he goes out the door.

642
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:03,275
所以，我不相信是他做的
So they tell me he did it. But I don't believe it.

643
00:50:03,622 --> 00:50:07,113
瓦基克小姐，听我说，你必须到银行来一趟
Mrs. Wortzik, listen to me. They want you down at the bank.

644
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:11,022
他的身体有可能会做，但他的头脑绝不可能
His body functions might've done it, but he himself, he didn't do it!

645
00:50:19,302 --> 00:50:23,624
亲爱的艾比我梦过掉到水里
"Dear Abby: Lately I've been dreaming about falling into water...

646
00:50:23,807 --> 00:50:27,071
无法接近水面
...and not being able to reach the surface.

647
00:50:27,242 --> 00:50:31,530
我呼吸困难，我惊醒后一身冷汗
I begin to breathe heavily and I wake up in a cold sweat.

648
00:50:31,714 --> 00:50:35,979
一个朋友说我的问题是因为性压抑
A friend tells me that my problem is one of sexual repression. "

649
00:50:36,918 --> 00:50:39,283
玛格莉特，你还好吧？
Margaret, are you all right?

650
00:50:57,737 --> 00:51:01,502
你有没有对里面的女孩做任何事？
Are you doing anything to any of those girls on there?

651
00:51:02,107 --> 00:51:03,664
又是他
He's back again.

652
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,668
这是谁？
Who's this?

653
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:14,880
桑尼…玛格莉特
Look at Margaret.

654
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:19,477
她怎么了？
What's the matter with her?

655
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:22,253
这里没有空气
There's no air in here.

656
00:51:25,927 --> 00:51:28,315
空调坏了吗？
What happened to the air conditioning?

657
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:35,761
苏，我很抱歉
I'm sorry, Syl.

658
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:41,762
空调在哪儿？　　地下室
Where's the air conditioning?

659
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,850
In the basement.

660
00:51:46,279 --> 00:51:49,076
沙尔，我下去看看空调
I'll go check the air conditioning.

661
00:51:49,782 --> 00:51:52,477
很快就回来　　　桑尼！
I'll be right back.

662
00:51:57,688 --> 00:51:58,676
干嘛？

663
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:03,147
我从没坐过飞机
I never been up in an airplane before.

664
00:52:08,165 --> 00:52:09,654
又怎样？
So?

665
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,455
我是说…坐飞机跟坐车一样
I mean, it's safe. It's like a car.

666
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:15,362
事实上，比车还安全
It's safer than a car.

667
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:19,739
别害怕，沙尔
It's all right, Sal.

668
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:27,668
我要去检查空调了
I'm going to go check it now.

669
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,196
沙尔，他们从后面进来了
They're coming in the back!

670
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,096
进去金库，快点
In the vault!

671
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:01,907
回去，退回去　　　不，不要开枪
-Get back! -No, don't fire!

672
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:10,374
桑尼，注意点
That's it, Sonny!

673
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,242
带她进去，快进去
Get her in there!

674
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:17,787
那枪是谁开的？
Who fired that shot?

675
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:21,217
Pick her up and put her in.

676
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:24,720
是谁开枪的？
Who fired?

677
00:53:26,266 --> 00:53:28,358
快点，动作快！
Come on! Move!

678
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:29,825
好，抬腿
Okay, legs!

679
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:37,206
桑尼！

680
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,435
嘿，桑尼
Get the bullhorn!

681
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,904
拿扩音器给我！

682
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:45,939
桑尼！

683
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:51,945
你拿到扩音器了吗？
You got that bullhorn?

684
00:53:57,493 --> 00:53:58,516
嘿，桑尼！

685
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:02,361
出来吧，桑尼！
Come on out, Sonny!

686
00:54:04,266 --> 00:54:05,357
桑尼！

687
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:07,859
妈的！这是我“最”需要的了
That's all I need.

688
00:54:10,305 --> 00:54:12,636
桑尼！　　桑尼…

689
00:54:12,907 --> 00:54:14,032
你去处理一下吧！
Take care of that, will you?

690
00:54:15,876 --> 00:54:17,069
桑尼，出来吧！
Come on out!

691
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:19,768
你们安静点儿行不行啊！
Straighten that out, will you?

692
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:21,201
桑尼！

693
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:23,108
桑尼，出来吧！
Sonny, come on out.

694
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:26,808
桑尼？

695
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,345
桑尼！

696
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:37,484
桑尼！　　王八蛋，你想害死那些人吗？
You son of a bitch, you want to get those people killed?

697
00:54:37,995 --> 00:54:39,427
出来吧，桑尼！

698
00:54:43,366 --> 00:54:44,764
桑尼，出来吧！

699
00:54:49,272 --> 00:54:50,602
现在就出来吧！
Come on out here, now.

700
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:55,170
快出来吧！桑尼

701
00:54:55,611 --> 00:54:56,804
桑尼！

702
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:02,140
桑尼！

703
00:55:05,253 --> 00:55:06,947
快出来吧，桑尼！

704
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:10,487
我可以看到你了，出来吧
I see you, Sonny, come on!

705
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,279
来吧

706
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,297
你神经错乱啦？
What's the matter with you?

707
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:33,138
什么？　　你在里面开什么枪啊？
-What? -Why'd you fire that shot in there?

708
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,800
我们有两百五十个警察在这边！　　该死！
We got 250 cops here!

709
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,674
那你们在后头搞什么鬼？　　别再里头乱来！
Fuck you! What were they doing back there?

710
00:55:37,982 --> 00:55:39,846
你到底在玩什么把戏？
What the hell's the matter with you?

711
00:55:40,149 --> 00:55:42,309
什么？　　我们还要不要谈判？
Are we dealing?

712
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:44,349
他们想进来是不是？　　谁？
-They were trying to get in there? -Who?

713
00:55:44,754 --> 00:55:46,675
少来这套！你心里明白
Come on, you know who!

714
00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:49,648
这到底是怎么回事？　　你们这群蠢蛋
-What's going on? -You're full of shit!

715
00:55:49,825 --> 00:55:51,780
去后面看看发生什么事
Find out what's going on there!

716
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,655
我真的不知道　　　你别装模作样了
-Honest to God, Sonny, I don't know! -Bullshit!

717
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:56,716
通讯设备还没架好　　　鬼扯…
Communications aren't set up yet.

718
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:59,319
找其他人来跟我谈吧　　　去你妈的！
Get someone to talk to me!

719
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,421
叫别人来吧，我不想再跟你谈了
I'm not talking to you anymore.

720
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:04,430
让我跟你谈吧？　　你这说一套做一套的人
-Let me talk to you. -You say this, you do that.

721
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:07,059
他们在后面做什么？　　我也不知道
Why were they back there?

722
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,538
是吗？你不知道，又在装了　　　那是突击队
I don't know!

723
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:08,427
You're full of shit!

724
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:10,512
-It's another force. -A tactical force!

725
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,303
他们喜欢开枪及攀岩走壁
They like to shoot, climb through windows!

726
00:56:13,479 --> 00:56:16,504
没有你的下令，他们也可以蛮干吗？
They like that, right! Without your orders, right?

727
00:56:16,682 --> 00:56:18,239
是的！他们不听我的命令
Yes! Without my orders!

728
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,073
我怎么知道你们不会从屋顶上冲进来？
You coming through the roof?

729
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:23,447
因为我说不会！　　是吗？你说的全是放屁！
I tell you we won't.

730
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:24,898
You're telling me a lot of things, but you're not doing them.

731
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:26,544
我讲了什么？　　他们在干嘛？

732
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,440
What were they doing?!

733
00:56:26,724 --> 00:56:29,647
我不知道　　　你不能回答我
-I don't know! -And you can't answer me.

734
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:31,582
什么？　　你不能回答我
-You can't answer. -Yes, I can.

735
00:56:31,728 --> 00:56:34,252
我可以，后面再干嘛！　　那告诉我他们在干嘛？
So tell me what they were doing.

736
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:37,324
我们没有通讯设备，所以我派人到后面去
No communications! I sent someone back there.

737
00:56:37,484 --> 00:56:42,409
若沙尔开杀戒，全都是你的错，不是我的
I got a guy in there who's going to kill somebody. That's your responsibility.

738
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:46,284
等等，你的要求我们都办好了　　　是吗？
Wait a minute, hold on. We got everything you wanted.

739
00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:49,757
是的，我们找不到直升机，但有辆巴士
Can't get a helicopter, but a bus is coming.

740
00:56:50,229 --> 00:56:52,856
飞机在甘尼迪机场待命，好吗？
We got a jet coming into Kennedy, all right?

741
00:56:53,198 --> 00:56:54,255
可以吗？

742
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,688
好吧？

743
00:56:57,336 --> 00:56:59,291
我们已经找到你太太
We got ahold of your wife.

744
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,100
她现在正要赶过来这里
Your wife is coming.

745
00:57:01,573 --> 00:57:03,836
我们已找到你太太，她现在正要赶过来
We reached her and she's coming here.

746
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,298
可以吗？
Where are you going?

747
00:57:05,511 --> 00:57:08,070
你要去哪？　　不去哪，我还是在这里…

748
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,682
I'm right here. I thought we were going to talk.

749
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:10,079
我以为我们要谈判的

750
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:11,975
我也是，但我们还没有谈
I thought so, too. But we're not.

751
00:57:12,184 --> 00:57:13,946
我们现在谈　　　你们却想从后门闯进来
We're trying to get in the back door.

752
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,950
你太太将在三十分钟内赶到这儿
Your wife will be here soon.

753
00:57:16,488 --> 00:57:17,476
可以吗？

754
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,951
满意吗？　　他们为什么枪还指着我？
They're still pointing. They love it.

755
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,318
把枪收好！
Holster that weapon! Holster it!

756
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:22,653
收好！

757
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:24,189
把枪收好！
Holster that weapon!

758
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:26,429
你也是
You too!

759
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:30,032
好了吧
All right, come on.

760
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,396
怎样？　　你还想怎样？
-What? -What else do you want me to do?

761
00:57:32,604 --> 00:57:34,434
你是要我怎样？
How could you do any better?

762
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:36,930
我们什么都答应你了
We got all you wanted.

763
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:39,566
你的要求我都答应
I'll do anything I can to stop anything.

764
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:43,174
你还需要其他东西吗？
Anything else?

765
00:57:43,516 --> 00:57:45,210
有　　　什么？
-Yeah. -What?

766
00:57:45,385 --> 00:57:48,114
里面的人饿了
I got some people in there that are hungry.

767
00:57:48,288 --> 00:57:50,778
可否给他们点食物？　　没问题，要什么？
-Can you get food? -What do you want?

768
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,650
送些披萨进去，好不好？　　好啊！
-Want some pizzas? -Yeah, all right.

769
00:57:54,026 --> 00:57:55,049
嘿，卡麦

770
00:57:56,196 --> 00:57:57,685
送些披萨进去
Get some pizzas in.

771
00:57:58,264 --> 00:58:00,219
可不可以再来点啤酒？　　嗯…
Can we get some beer, you think?

772
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:03,253
不好不好，还是汽水吧？
No beer. Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right?

773
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:04,595
好吧？

774
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,758
卡麦

775
00:58:06,106 --> 00:58:08,596
记得还要有可乐汽水
Some soft drinks too, okay? Cokes!

776
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:10,696
还要什么吗？　　再来点阿斯匹灵吧！
-What else? -And some aspirin too.

777
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,707
还要阿斯匹灵　　　有人不舒服
Some lady's not feeling well.

778
00:58:13,179 --> 00:58:14,372
没有了吧？
Anything else?

779
00:58:15,682 --> 00:58:19,139
还有…不准耍我！　　不会！我干嘛耍你？
Don't con me.

780
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:19,526
I'm not! Why would I want to do that?

781
00:58:19,352 --> 00:58:23,048
我已经够烦的了，也不想自找麻烦
I'm in trouble enough as it is. I'm not trying to create any trouble.

782
00:58:24,023 --> 00:58:25,148
好吧！

783
00:58:32,866 --> 00:58:34,059
没事了
It's okay.

784
00:58:38,238 --> 00:58:40,934
直升机没办法停在这儿
They can't bring a helicopter in here.

785
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:43,294
沙尔，直升机没办法停在这儿
They can't land it here.

786
00:58:43,676 --> 00:58:47,031
他们要换一辆大巴士，可容纳我们全部
They're going to get us a big bus so we can all get in.

787
00:58:47,213 --> 00:58:49,203
接我们去机场
And that's how we get to the airport.

788
00:58:50,484 --> 00:58:52,075
目前情况还不错
It looks good.

789
00:58:54,854 --> 00:58:58,050
还有我刚帮你们叫了些吃的
You people, I just ordered you some food.

790
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:01,286
也有阿斯匹灵
I even got her some aspirins.

791
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:02,950
一切都进行得很顺利
So we're moving it along now.

792
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,288
对了！我还得付食物钱，那些做记号的五元钞在哪？
I got to pay for the food. Where's the marked fives?

793
00:59:07,468 --> 00:59:10,164
你刚做了件愚蠢的事
That was a foolish thing you did back there.

794
00:59:12,305 --> 00:59:13,828
愚蠢的事？
Foolish thing.

795
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:19,535
我们还要继续这样下去？
We going to get the ball rolling?

796
00:59:19,712 --> 00:59:22,202
对啊！不然你以为我在干嘛？
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

797
00:59:22,348 --> 00:59:24,474
事情一直在进行
I'm working on it. What's it look like?

798
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:27,142
你以为这是件简单的事？我不能激怒他们
You think it's easy? I got to keep them cool.

799
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:29,151
还要顾到你们
I got to keep you people happy.

800
00:59:29,322 --> 00:59:31,551
我想点子又谈判，都是我一人在做
I got to have the ideas and do it all alone.

801
00:59:31,725 --> 00:59:33,680
我在努力了，你想试试吗？
You want to try it?

802
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,520
桑尼，你要的食物来了
Your food is here, Sonny.

803
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:39,891
我开始讨厌你了
You're starting to get on my nerves.

804
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:52,708
跟着他进去，不会有事的
Go on with him there. You'll be all right. Go right ahead.

805
00:59:55,783 --> 00:59:58,376
多少钱？　　付过了，已经付过了
-What do I owe you? -It's all paid for.

806
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:01,816
没关系，我来付　　　有零钱
-No, I've paid for that. -I got it.

807
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:03,285
拿去
Here.

808
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:04,786
零钱留着
Keep the change.

809
01:00:11,732 --> 01:00:13,096
你想要这个
You want this?

810
01:00:17,171 --> 01:00:18,159
你们喜欢？
You like it?

811
01:00:28,617 --> 01:00:30,675
摩瑞提，要不要？
Moretti, could you use five?

812
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:41,220
还有很多
I got a lot for you.

813
01:00:52,007 --> 01:00:53,633
退后，该死的！
Get back, god damn it!

814
01:01:11,726 --> 01:01:14,387
还要…
More! More! More!

815
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:26,265
可以帮我开门吗？
Could you open it?

816
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:28,940
谢了
Thank you, man.

817
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:35,910
我成了明星！
I'm a fucking star!

818
01:02:00,108 --> 01:02:01,096
踢

819
01:02:01,576 --> 01:02:03,770
往上，翻转

820
01:02:04,044 --> 01:02:07,570
抱她起来，她不会有事的
No, just pick her up and hold her. She'll be okay.

821
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:10,879
你踢得不错嘛！
You kick good. Here.

822
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:21,286
踢！

823
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,118
往上！
This is where it gets stuck!

824
01:02:23,398 --> 01:02:25,195
就是在这里卡住的

825
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:33,135
她在愚弄自己
Miriam's making a fool of herself.

826
01:02:34,642 --> 01:02:37,940
谁有烟？　　我有
Anybody got a cigarette? Yeah, I do.

827
01:02:38,246 --> 01:02:39,735
你不是不抽烟？
Sylvia, you don't smoke!

828
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:43,473
你不抽烟？
You don't?

829
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:45,674
不抽

830
01:02:47,322 --> 01:02:49,277
那你现在干嘛抽？
Why do you want to start now?

831
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,855
我快吓死了，你不抽烟吗？
-I'm scared to death, that's why. -You don't smoke?

832
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:55,283
不抽　　　为什么？
No. How come?

833
01:03:00,436 --> 01:03:02,733
我不想得癌症　　　我的天啊！
-I don't want the cancer. -My God!

834
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:04,729
把烟给我吧
The cigarette.

835
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,567
爱抽就抽吧
Do what you want.

836
01:03:08,209 --> 01:03:10,597
我只觉得应该照顾自己的身体
I think you ought to take care of your body.

837
01:03:10,812 --> 01:03:12,676
我的身体？为什么？
My body? What for?

838
01:03:15,718 --> 01:03:17,708
身体是上帝的庙宇
Your body is the temple of the Lord.

839
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:22,151
你是认真的？
You're serious!

840
01:03:25,226 --> 01:03:27,181
你可以抢银行
So you rob a bank...

841
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:30,422
但不能沾恶习，是这样的吗？
...but you keep your body pure. Is that it?

842
01:03:35,904 --> 01:03:37,734
你到底要不要抽？
You going to smoke or what?

843
01:03:40,076 --> 01:03:41,372
要！
Yes.

844
01:03:41,544 --> 01:03:44,205
如果我因此得癌症，你得负一半的责任
If I die of cancer, it'll be half your fault.

845
01:03:49,552 --> 01:03:51,212
不，那是因为你意志力薄弱
No, it's because you're weak.

846
01:03:51,554 --> 01:03:53,214
是的！我意志力薄弱
Right, I'm weak.

847
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,052
你的子弹呢？
Where's your bullets?

848
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:58,715
我是马维尼…
Mulvaney speaking.

849
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,062
是摩瑞提
It's Moretti.

850
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,558
喂　　　你们千万不要轻举妄动
Will you guys hold it down back there?

851
01:04:10,774 --> 01:04:12,571
桑尼，你太太来了
They're bringing in your wife.

852
01:04:30,259 --> 01:04:32,624
摩瑞提在哪儿？　　可能在酒吧里
-Where's Moretti? -Probably in the bar.

853
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,695
在理发厅里
In the barber shop.

854
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:46,700
这是什么？
What's that?

855
01:04:47,977 --> 01:04:50,069
我们在你说的地址找到他
We went to Bellevue where you told us...

856
01:04:50,247 --> 01:04:51,736
他说是他太太
...said he was his wife.

857
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:53,779
在教堂结婚的
They were married in a church.

858
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,382
天啊！
Jesus Christ!

859
01:04:55,885 --> 01:04:57,181
礼昂！

860
01:05:00,723 --> 01:05:01,780
礼昂！

861
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,584
礼昂！在这儿
Leon, over here!

862
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,924
礼昂…

863
01:05:08,031 --> 01:05:09,395
礼昂，我在这边

864
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:11,625
礼昂！
Happy birthday!

865
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,231
生日快乐！

866
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:25,338
让让　　　小心他的头…
-Give us some room. -Watch his head!

867
01:05:30,152 --> 01:05:31,641
他是同志？
He's a queer?

868
01:05:32,655 --> 01:05:34,918
探长，他找你
Sarge, he wants you!

869
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:39,280
我不要这保护罩，拿走！
Get the shield out of here. I don't need it now.

870
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:41,994
要的时候都不会出现
Where were you 4 hours ago, when I needed it?

871
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:44,689
他们不会开枪的，桑尼，什么事？
He's not going to shoot. Yeah, Sonny, what?

872
01:05:44,968 --> 01:05:47,231
怎么了？他还好吧？
What happened? Is he all right?

873
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:48,597
他只是有点头昏罢了
He's a little groggy.

874
01:05:48,772 --> 01:05:52,730
让我跟他说话　　　我等下叫他打电话给你
No, let me talk to him.

875
01:05:50,995 --> 01:05:53,205
I'll get him on his feet and call back.

876
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:54,737
把门关上
Shut the door!

877
01:05:57,214 --> 01:06:00,273
安静点，我不想听到任何噪音
Stop the noise. I don't want to hear a fucking sound!

878
01:06:00,684 --> 01:06:02,082
打字机！
Typewriter!

879
01:06:02,252 --> 01:06:03,980
挂电话！
Get off the fucking phone.

880
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:06,449
快点！
Now!

881
01:06:06,823 --> 01:06:08,551
给我些水！
Give me some water.

882
01:06:11,328 --> 01:06:12,487
礼昂

883
01:06:13,597 --> 01:06:14,585
礼昂
You all right? They give you a shot down at the hospital or something?

884
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:18,460
你还好吧，礼昂？医院是不是帮你打针了？

885
01:06:19,636 --> 01:06:20,727
我的天啊！
They shot me with, like, unreal!

886
01:06:20,937 --> 01:06:22,858
一针打下去我整个人都昏了

887
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,029
你可要振作点！
You got to get ahold of yourself...

888
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:28,131
你待会儿还得劝他走出银行
...so you can talk to him, and see if he'll come out.

889
01:06:28,712 --> 01:06:29,837
我不知道
He's got 8 people there, with a Sal. You know him?

890
01:06:30,213 --> 01:06:32,737
里面有八个人，还有个叫沙尔的认识吗？

891
01:06:33,183 --> 01:06:36,345
不太认识　　　他说他要杀死这八个人
-No, not really. -He says he's going to shoot them.

892
01:06:36,653 --> 01:06:40,281
我…帮不上忙的，我不能阻止他
I can't help it. I can't stop him from anything.

893
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:42,117
他不听你的听谁的？
Who will he listen to, then?

894
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:45,419
我没办法跟他说，他不会听任何人的话
I can't talk to him. He won't listen to anybody.

895
01:06:45,595 --> 01:06:48,085
他整个夏天都怪怪的
He's been crazy all summer.

896
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,630
六月的时候他就想杀我了
He's tried to kill me since June.

897
01:06:53,136 --> 01:06:56,491
他用枪指着我的头，用刀割我
He put a gun to my head. And he cut me with a knife.

898
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:59,664
还打我朋友　　　你有试过叫警察吗？
-He beat up my friends. -Did you contact the police?

899
01:07:00,444 --> 01:07:02,172
有什么用？
What good would that do?

900
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:06,471
他会更生气，他们阻止不了他的
It'd just make him mad. They don't know him. It wouldn't stop him.

901
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:10,438
总得有人阻止他　　　你不懂，他疯了！
-Somebody's got to stop him. -You don't understand. He's crazy.

902
01:07:15,126 --> 01:07:16,752
他有老婆、小孩
He's got a wife, children.

903
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,452
是个好爸爸
He's a wonderful father.

904
01:07:20,998 --> 01:07:22,055
他的妈妈…
His mother...

905
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:26,498
你该见识一下，看看他父母，他们简直是场大灾难
...you should see her. Together with his father, they're like a car wreck.

906
01:07:27,271 --> 01:07:29,659
但他挑起重担
It just rolls off his back.

907
01:07:30,074 --> 01:07:33,201
他探望他们，还帮他们付房租…难以置信
He sees them. He pays the rent. Unbelievable!

908
01:07:34,845 --> 01:07:38,610
我是个想结婚的人，他不想，不过…
I was the one that wanted to get married. He didn't really want it...

909
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:42,516
但他却结婚了，我不知道为什么！
...but he did it. I don't know why.

910
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,842
你为什么想结婚？
Why did you want to get married?

911
01:07:48,492 --> 01:07:50,721
我以为会对我有好处
I thought it would help me.

912
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:52,452
可是…

913
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:54,291
可是…实际上没有
But it didn't.

914
01:07:56,233 --> 01:07:58,359
我以前很困惑…
I was so confused. I was doing...

915
01:07:58,536 --> 01:07:59,968
常常做傻事
...insane things.

916
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:02,629
比方说？
What sort of things, Leon?

917
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:09,298
我在婚礼后
After the wedding...

918
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:13,011
逃去大西洋城十天
...I ran off for 10 days to Atlantic City.

919
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:15,775
桑尼气疯了
Sonny was frantic.

920
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:20,013
他知道我喝了酒，但不知道我跟谁去了哪
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't know where I was, who I was with.

921
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,555
我无法解释我所做过的事
I couldn't explain the things I did.

922
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:27,117
后来我去看心理医生
So I went to a psychiatrist...

923
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:29,162
他说…
...who told me...

924
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:33,425
我是个被困在男人身体的女人
...that I was a woman trapped in a man's body.

925
01:08:41,011 --> 01:08:45,071
所以一听到消息，桑尼便想帮我钱做变性手术
So right away he wanted to give me money for the sex change operation.

926
01:08:45,249 --> 01:08:47,273
但是他要去哪儿钱呢？
But where was he going to get it?

927
01:08:47,452 --> 01:08:49,783
两千伍百元？
$2,500?

928
01:08:50,122 --> 01:08:52,919
他本来就已经债台高筑了
My God, he was in hock up to his ears already.

929
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:54,978
他需要钱好让你做变性手术？
He needed the money for your operation?

930
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:57,316
他为这件事非常烦恼
It drove him crazy.

931
01:08:58,497 --> 01:09:00,794
他因此常常无故发脾气
He would fly into these rages.

932
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,029
我也变得很沮丧
And I got more depressed than ever.

933
01:09:04,235 --> 01:09:06,327
因为我知道，我永远不可能动手术
I knew I'd never get my operation.

934
01:09:06,804 --> 01:09:08,134
所以…

935
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:13,330
我企图自杀，我吞下的药，数都数不清
So I tried to kill myself. I took about a half a pound of pills.

936
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:17,570
蓝的、红的、黄的，所有的药我几乎都试过了
Blues, yellows, screamers, uppers, downers, you name it.

937
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:21,004
后来我被送进医院
And I wound up in the hospital.

938
01:09:23,053 --> 01:09:25,008
桑尼来看我时
And Sonny comes there...

939
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:27,282
他看着我
...and he just looks at me.

940
01:09:28,593 --> 01:09:30,321
问我
And he says...

941
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,553
礼昂，为什么？
..."Why, Leon?

942
01:09:32,863 --> 01:09:35,092
现在不是很好吗？
When things were going so good?"

943
01:09:40,205 --> 01:09:41,694
你不觉得…
Don't you think...

944
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:45,941
他是因为你才抢银行的？
...he did it for you?

945
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:51,540
嗯，我想是吧
Yeah, I guess so.

946
01:09:53,051 --> 01:09:56,178
难道你不想阻止他犯下大错？
Don't you think you owe it to him to try to get him out?

947
01:09:57,622 --> 01:09:59,748
我不敢跟他说话
I can't talk to him.

948
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:05,182
礼昂，你脱不了关系，你是个共犯
You're up to your neck in it. You're an accessory.

949
01:10:05,363 --> 01:10:10,493
这件事不能怪我　　　等等，你可以帮我们
-They can't hold me responsible. -Wait, you could help us a little.

950
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:11,862
我很怕
I'm afraid.

951
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:15,494
只要跟他说话，他在电话上又不能伤害你
Just talk to him for a minute. How can he hurt you on the phone?

952
01:10:18,743 --> 01:10:20,835
我不能…我不知道要说什么
I can't. I don't know what to....

953
01:10:21,012 --> 01:10:22,899
跟他讲几句就行了
Just talk with him on the phone.

954
01:10:30,256 --> 01:10:31,916
你考虑看看
You think about it.

955
01:10:39,298 --> 01:10:40,662
他不想跟你说话
He won't talk to you.

956
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:43,255
你什么意思？
What do you mean he won't talk to me?

957
01:10:43,736 --> 01:10:44,929
我再去试试看
I'll work on it.

958
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,899
你不是已经在劝他了吗？
I thought you were doing that.

959
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,876
他不想跟我说话
He won't talk to me.

960
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:16,190
警方正在询问礼昂谢摩，自认是双性恋的26岁男子
They are questioning Leon Schermer, a 26-year-old admitted homosexual...

961
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:20,599
声称曾与嫌犯于11月在教堂结过婚
...who claims to have married one of the bank robbers last November.

962
01:11:21,307 --> 01:11:24,798
根据我们在理发厅的消息来源指出
According to sources on the barber shop where Leon is held...

963
01:11:24,977 --> 01:11:26,568
礼昂的婚礼
...Leon has reportedly said...

964
01:11:26,746 --> 01:11:30,533
是由牧师柏克所主持的
...they were married in an official ceremony by a Father Burke.

965
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,077
礼昂的话已经过证实
Leon 's story has been confirmed.

966
01:11:34,654 --> 01:11:39,010
7个男的伴娘，还有桑尼的妈和七十个客人
7 bridesmaids, all male, Sonny's mother and 70 other guests...

967
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:41,613
所有的同性恋团体都出席了
...all members of the gay community.

968
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:47,517
我们已经取得一张礼昂穿婚纱礼服的照片
We've been able to obtain a still photograph of Leon on his gown.

969
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:50,891
礼昂还透露
Leon has confirmed...

970
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:55,335
所有的礼服共花了七百多元
...that the gowns for himself and his bridesmaids cost $700.

971
01:11:57,477 --> 01:12:00,639
我们至今仍无法与该牧师连系
We have not confirmed the story...

972
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,734
但据说他已被教会免职
...with the priest. But we are told that he was subsequently defrocked.

973
01:12:04,718 --> 01:12:09,142
全国各地的同性恋已陆续打电话进来
Phone calls have arrived from various factions of the gay community.

974
01:12:09,722 --> 01:12:13,987
有人支持桑尼的行动，也有人谴责
Some on support of Sonny and his actions, others condemning...

975
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:17,148
认为这件抢案和这种婚姻
...the present events and calling the marriage...

976
01:12:17,897 --> 01:12:21,753
是“全然的表现欲”
...a farce, and, quote, "A case of sheer exhibitionism. " End quote.

977
01:12:23,303 --> 01:12:27,693
我们正在报导两名同性恋以人质做威胁
Coverage of the robbery where 2 homosexuals hold hostages...

978
01:12:27,874 --> 01:12:30,364
要求坐直升机与飞机离开国家　　　桑尼…
...for their demands of a helicopter, a jet....

979
01:12:30,677 --> 01:12:34,407
桑尼…电视上说银行里有两个同性恋，听到没？
They said, "2 homosexuals in the bank. " Right on TV! You hear?

980
01:12:34,647 --> 01:12:37,877
那又怎样？他们爱怎么说就怎么说
What difference does it make? They can say anything they want.

981
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,482
随他们去说吧！
Let them say it.

982
01:12:44,624 --> 01:12:45,988
但我不是个同性恋
I'm not homosexual.

983
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:51,925
叫他们搞清楚，这会在电视上播出的
Tell them to get that right. That's going out on the TV.

984
01:12:57,169 --> 01:13:01,764
沙尔，你要我怎么做？我管不了播出内容
What am I supposed to do? I can't control what they say on television.

985
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:06,832
你要我怎么做，我已尽全力，我管不了他们
What should I do? I'm doing everything I can, I can't do that.

986
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,611
沙尔

987
01:13:13,487 --> 01:13:17,274
放心吧，他们像看戏很快就会忘的，无所谓
Forget about it. It's just a freak show to them, anyway. It don't matter.

988
01:13:17,557 --> 01:13:19,387
他们怎么说都无所谓
Whatever they say don't matter.

989
01:13:25,532 --> 01:13:26,964
没事的
It'll be all right.

990
01:13:36,243 --> 01:13:37,732
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

991
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:42,545
你怎么可以让这小事坏兴致？
You shouldn't let something like that spoil your fun.

992
01:13:43,016 --> 01:13:45,074
看开点
You have to get fun out of life.

993
01:13:52,025 --> 01:13:53,889
为什么飞机还不来？
Where's the god damn jet?

994
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:57,815
不需要飞机时
They're always screaming overhead, going somewhere...

995
01:13:58,131 --> 01:14:00,257
它们总是从天上呼啸而过
...when you don't need them, you know?

996
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:28,285
你上飞机后，要跟驾驶员说什么？
What are you going to tell the pilot when you get on the plane?

997
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:31,657
这是应该知道的事情
You have to know, right?

998
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,697
荷兰其实是个不错的国家
Holland's pretty good.

999
01:14:33,868 --> 01:14:37,689
荷兰？怎么说？　　他们在战争时很照顾难民
-Holland? -They sheltered people during the war.

1000
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:39,360
是个不错的民族
They're good people.

1001
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:41,330
荷兰在哪儿？
Where's Holland?

1002
01:14:41,642 --> 01:14:43,404
荷兰在…
It's right up....

1003
01:14:43,578 --> 01:14:44,908
在这儿！
It's over there!

1004
01:14:47,647 --> 01:14:49,409
可不可以给我地图？

1005
01:14:53,954 --> 01:14:56,114
快进金库，快点！
Get in the vault. Come on!

1006
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,576
Quickly!

1007
01:15:09,637 --> 01:15:12,264
他们在等我们采取行动
They're waiting for us to do something, I think.

1008
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:17,470
桑尼…

1009
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,670
桑尼，快出来！
Come on out for a second.

1010
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:21,938
是他！就是他！
It's him.

1011
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:24,640
出来！我有话跟你说
Come on out. I want to talk to you a second.

1012
01:15:27,421 --> 01:15:28,853
去吧！桑尼　　　桑尼
Come on!

1013
01:15:37,298 --> 01:15:38,389
桑尼！

1014
01:15:39,567 --> 01:15:41,158
桑尼！出来一下
Come on out, Sonny.

1015
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,361
桑尼？

1016
01:15:48,409 --> 01:15:50,035
出来一下
Come on out a minute.

1017
01:15:51,512 --> 01:15:52,569
出来！
That's it.

1018
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:06,991
摩瑞提！

1019
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,790
又怎么了？把灯打开
What the fuck is going on? Get the lights back on.

1020
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:14,831
摩瑞提！

1021
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,127
你是谁？
Who are you?

1022
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:21,336
调查局的沙登
FBI, Sheldon.

1023
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:25,467
很好
Good.

1024
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:29,039
终于有人出面了，我们可以办正事了吧？
About time. Maybe we can get this thing started?

1025
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,081
听好，把灯打开…
Look, get the lights back on...

1026
01:16:31,285 --> 01:16:34,378
还有空调，我们里面没有空调了
...and the air conditioner. We got no air conditioning.

1027
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,887
桑尼，我们不会给你面子了
No more favors. That's all over.

1028
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,252
给我面子？
Favors?

1029
01:16:38,426 --> 01:16:41,053
你今晚都是在给我面子？
You been doing me favors all night?

1030
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,584
飞机准备好了，礼车半小时后就到
I have a jet, limo will be here in a half hour.

1031
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:48,493
但是我要人质
I want the hostages.

1032
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:51,967
少来，别唬我！
No, no. Bullshit!

1033
01:16:52,673 --> 01:16:57,496
我想合作，不是作对　　　人质是我的护身符
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.

1034
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,709
The hostages are what's keeping me alive.

1035
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,176
什么时候放他们出来？
When do I get them?

1036
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,375
没有人告诉你吗？
Didn't they tell you?

1037
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,217
我要听你亲口说
I'd like to hear it from you.

1038
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:14,754
一辆车，换一个人质
You get one hostage for the limousine that you bring me in.

1039
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,519
一架飞机，换一个人质
One hostage for the jet.

1040
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,226
到了机场，上了飞机，等我检查好
Then I get to the airport. I go into the plane, check it out.

1041
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:24,963
如果一切无误，我就会放了剩下的人质
And if it's okay, they all come out.

1042
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:29,273
我要进去　　　为什么？
-I want to go inside. -Why?

1043
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,071
确认大家都安全
See if everybody's all right.

1044
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,836
他们很安全
They're all right.

1045
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:34,505
我要亲眼目睹
No, I have to see.

1046
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,349
你有种！
You got guts.

1047
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:48,883
若我们杀了他们，还会让你活着出来吗？
Think if we slit their throats, we're going to let you out?

1048
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:50,793
我要亲眼看到
I have to see.

1049
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,403
我得跟我同伴商量
I got to check with my partner.

1050
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,344
沙尔，调查局的人要进来
The FBI, Sal. They're coming in.

1051
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:30,966
你想杀我？
You'd like to kill me?

1052
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,401
你一定很想杀了我
Bet you would.

1053
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,006
我不想杀你
I wouldn't like to kill you.

1054
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:35,837
但必要时我会的
I will if I have to.

1055
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,808
这是你的工作，对吧？
It's your job, right?

1056
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,806
我希望杀我的人
The guy who kills me...

1057
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:45,181
是因为恨我入骨，而不是因为工作因素
...I hope he does it because he hates my guts, not because it's his job.

1058
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:54,990
不要报上真名，他是调查局的人
Nobody give your right name. It's the FBI.

1059
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:10,235
只想确定各位小姐没有受伤
Just want to make sure all you young ladies are all right in here.

1060
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:14,945
他们很久前就要了飞机，你们究竟在拖什么？
They asked for the jet hours ago. What are you doing?

1061
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:18,348
我们正在安排，两小时后就救你们出去
That's being set up. We'll have you out in a few hours.

1062
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:21,751
两小时后？　　为什么不直接答应他们的要求？
-A few hours? -Why don't you give them what they want?

1063
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,881
他们会得到想要的，我们也要确定能得到所要的
They'll get it. We want to be sure we get what we want.

1064
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:27,915
我要将你们平安带离这里
Let's get you all out of here safe.

1065
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:31,029
也包括你们俩
You two boys too.

1066
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,598
不要再靠近了
That's close enough.

1067
01:19:36,339 --> 01:19:39,694
去告诉电视台，别再播银行里有两个同性恋
Tell the TV to stop saying there's 2 homosexuals in here.

1068
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:41,934
我会的，沙尔
I will.

1069
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,510
桑尼，出来一下
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

1070
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:13,603
你处理得很好
You handled yourself well.

1071
01:20:13,777 --> 01:20:18,008
比一般人还好，减少可能会有的伤亡人数
A lot of men would have choked. We might have had a death on our hands.

1072
01:20:18,182 --> 01:20:20,979
你处理得很好，我尊敬你
But you handled it. I respect that.

1073
01:20:21,551 --> 01:20:24,815
把沙尔交给我们来处理
Don't you try to take Sal. We'll handle him.

1074
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:27,777
你只要不轻举妄动，就不会受伤
Sit tight and you won't get hurt.

1075
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:29,686
等一下，你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1076
01:20:31,462 --> 01:20:33,053
你不必管
You just sit quiet.

1077
01:20:34,498 --> 01:20:35,657
把沙尔交给我们处理吧！
We'll handle Sal.

1078
01:20:39,436 --> 01:20:42,063
你以为我会出卖他？去你妈的！
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?

1079
01:20:59,123 --> 01:21:00,419
他说什么？
What'd he say?

1080
01:21:02,993 --> 01:21:05,119
他只是告诉我他们的计划
He was just talking about arrangements.

1081
01:21:05,296 --> 01:21:08,526
我有告诉他电视的事，别担心
I talked to him about the TV. It will be all right.

1082
01:21:09,233 --> 01:21:11,655
就这样？　　对
That's all?

1083
01:21:13,871 --> 01:21:15,394
那他为什么不在这儿说？
Why couldn't he say it here?

1084
01:21:17,107 --> 01:21:22,362
我不知道！他想给我看车子要打哪儿进来
I don't know. He wanted to show me how the bus is going to come in.

1085
01:21:32,656 --> 01:21:33,679
怎么了？
What's the matter?

1086
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:36,985
去倒杯水！
Someone get a glass of water.

1087
01:21:39,264 --> 01:21:40,252
有没有手帕？
Got a hankie?

1088
01:21:42,266 --> 01:21:43,459
他们在披萨里下毒！
They poisoned the pizza.

1089
01:21:43,634 --> 01:21:45,225
不是啦！
It's not the pizza!

1090
01:21:45,402 --> 01:21:47,164
他有糖尿病！
He's got diabetes.

1091
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:52,299
他刚有喝可乐，别给他吃东西，我来拿
He had some Coke before. Don't give him anything. I'll hold it.

1092
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:55,840
需要我们帮忙吗，马维尼先生？
What can we do for you, Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us.

1093
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:02,542
这里有没有医生？
Is there a doctor out here?

1094
01:22:05,722 --> 01:22:07,780
我们需要一个医生
We need a doctor in here.

1095
01:22:10,662 --> 01:22:12,185
我们需要一个医生
We need a doctor.

1096
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:16,792
怎么了？　　经理有糖尿病
What?

1097
01:22:16,968 --> 01:22:18,366
他不太舒服
The manager, he's diabetic. He don't look good.

1098
01:22:32,116 --> 01:22:33,605
我要搜身
I got to search you.

1099
01:22:52,237 --> 01:22:53,396
只准他进来
Just him.

1100
01:22:54,939 --> 01:22:56,030
桑尼

1101
01:22:57,575 --> 01:23:01,396
我已经说服礼昂跟你说话，他现在在电话上
I've convinced Leon to talk to you. He's on the phone now.

1102
01:23:15,226 --> 01:23:16,715
他要接了
He's coming on.

1103
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:26,696
喂？

1104
01:23:27,672 --> 01:23:28,729
喂？

1105
01:23:29,407 --> 01:23:30,771
喂？礼昂？
Hello, Leon?

1106
01:23:31,142 --> 01:23:32,199
喂？
Hello, Sonny.

1107
01:23:32,443 --> 01:23:34,137
喂？桑尼

1108
01:23:34,313 --> 01:23:35,870
怎么了？
What happened?

1109
01:23:36,047 --> 01:23:38,435
你…还好吧？
How are you doing?

1110
01:23:38,616 --> 01:23:41,345
嗯，我出院了
Well, I'm out of the hospital.

1111
01:23:41,553 --> 01:23:45,181
我知道，我以为你永远也不能出院
Yeah, I know. I thought you'd never get out.

1112
01:23:47,225 --> 01:23:50,113
我没想过会是这样出院的　　　是啊
I never thought I'd get out this way, I'll tell you.

1113
01:23:51,563 --> 01:23:53,154
你还好吧？
How are you doing?

1114
01:23:55,234 --> 01:23:57,394
我在发抖　　　是吗？
I'm a little shaky.

1115
01:23:57,569 --> 01:24:01,095
摩瑞提说你不想跟我说话
Moretti told me that you were all drugged up...

1116
01:24:02,107 --> 01:24:03,905
我想可能是你吃药的关系
...so I figured that's why you didn't want to talk. I was wondering why.

1117
01:24:03,907 --> 01:24:06,805
我刚还在想为什么你不想跟我说话

1118
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:08,468
对啊，那里好糟糕
It was really terrible, you know?

1119
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:12,036
一进去他们就认定你疯了
You walk in, and right away they say you're crazy.

1120
01:24:12,217 --> 01:24:15,413
然后就开始帮你打针，我的意思是…
Then they start sticking things in your arm.

1121
01:24:15,754 --> 01:24:19,541
你一天到晚昏昏沉沉，病怎么好得起来？
How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?

1122
01:24:21,126 --> 01:24:24,014
我才刚刚开始清醒
I'm just starting to come out of it now.

1123
01:24:25,197 --> 01:24:27,084
嗯　　　嗯
So, how are you?

1124
01:24:27,533 --> 01:24:30,660
你好吗？　　我很好

1125
01:24:29,302 --> 01:24:30,678
I'm fine.

1126
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:34,465
这个场面有点扯吧？
This is something, huh?

1127
01:24:37,876 --> 01:24:40,070
是啊…

1128
01:24:41,179 --> 01:24:44,341
我不知道礼昂…我就快死在这儿了
I don't know. I'm dying here.

1129
01:24:44,983 --> 01:24:46,381
我快死了

1130
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,584
听听你自己说“快死了”的德性？
You ever listen to yourself when you say, "You're dying"?

1131
01:24:51,757 --> 01:24:54,748
你听听你自己！　　你在说什么？
-You ever listen to yourself? -What are you talking about?

1132
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,417
你这话是什么意思？什么你快死了
What do you mean, what am I talking about? "You're dying. "

1133
01:24:58,597 --> 01:25:01,485
你知道你每天都跟我说，你快死了吗？
Do you know that you say that to me every day?

1134
01:25:02,835 --> 01:25:05,826
不是你快死了，是你在杀死你身边的人
You're not dying. You're killing the people around you.

1135
01:25:06,004 --> 01:25:09,564
礼昂，别这样好不好？不要跟我废话
Leon, don't give me that shit. I don't need that deep shit now!

1136
01:25:09,742 --> 01:25:12,266
我想你可能不知道，这话是什么意思
You don't realize what the things you do mean.

1137
01:25:12,444 --> 01:25:15,105
是吗？我很清楚
Yeah?

1138
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:15,128
I know what I do.

1139
01:25:15,481 --> 01:25:17,209
你用枪指着别人的头
You stock a gun to somebody's head.

1140
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:19,576
我有时不知道自己在做什么　　　对
I don't know what I'm doing sometimes.

1141
01:25:19,753 --> 01:25:21,242
很明显的你不知道
Obviously, you don't.

1142
01:25:21,388 --> 01:25:24,117
“睡吧，礼昂，这样我扣扳机时就不会痛”
"Go to sleep so it won't hurt when I shoot. "

1143
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:27,581
你以为我在医院里做啥？
What do you think I've been doing on the hospital?

1144
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:31,252
我吃药是为了离开你，对吧？　　是啊
I take a handful of pills to get away from you.

1145
01:25:32,198 --> 01:25:34,757
结果我现在又和你通电话
Now I'm talking to you on the phone again.

1146
01:25:34,934 --> 01:25:37,731
我没有工作，没有朋友
I've got no job. I don't have friends.

1147
01:25:37,903 --> 01:25:40,564
我必须要跟人接触才活得下去
I can't live. I have to live with people.

1148
01:25:42,474 --> 01:25:44,361
对不起，你老是把死挂在嘴边，我听不下去了
This death business, I'm sorry.

1149
01:25:44,543 --> 01:25:47,773
我不知道我为什么要在这忍受你这堆废话
I don't know what I'm getting here with that shit.

1150
01:25:47,946 --> 01:25:52,143
你要我怎么回答？事情已经发生了
What am I supposed to say to that? This is going on.

1151
01:25:52,317 --> 01:25:54,807
你居然说这种话　　　对不起！
-You're giving me that shit. -I'm sorry.

1152
01:25:54,953 --> 01:25:56,510
你知道我现在的处境
You know what's happening.

1153
01:25:56,722 --> 01:25:59,451
你该知道我受的压力很大，你知道的！
You know the pressures I've been having, right?

1154
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:02,980
你知道我的这些压力…你在医院里…
I got these pressures. You know it. You're in that hospital...

1155
01:26:03,162 --> 01:26:06,426
全身插满了管子，又想动变性手术，对吧？
...with them tubes coming out and want that operation, right?

1156
01:26:06,599 --> 01:26:09,158
你跟我说了一堆废话，大家都给我气受
You're giving me that shit. Everybody's giving me shit.

1157
01:26:09,334 --> 01:26:14,191
每个人都要钱，你要我就帮你　　　对
Everybody needs money. So you needed money? I got you money.

1158
01:26:14,374 --> 01:26:16,000
可是我没叫你去抢银行啊
I didn't ask you to rob a bank!

1159
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:18,905
我知道你没要我去…
I know you didn't ask me.

1160
01:26:19,446 --> 01:26:22,642
我并不怪任何人
I'm not putting this on anybody, you know?

1161
01:26:22,815 --> 01:26:25,703
我不怪任何人，因为我是出于自愿的
Nothing on nobody! I did this on my own. You see?

1162
01:26:25,885 --> 01:26:29,012
你搞清楚了吗？我只是想让你知道…
All on my own, I did it. But I want you to know something.

1163
01:26:29,522 --> 01:26:32,251
我绝对能逃得出去
I want you to know that I'm getting out of here.

1164
01:26:32,892 --> 01:26:34,916
我会坐飞机离开这个地方
I'm getting a plane out of here...

1165
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:38,925
我只是想让你知道而已，我要你来这儿…
...and I just wanted you to know it. And I wanted you to come down...

1166
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:42,196
只是…想跟你说拜拜
...and I wanted to just say goodbye to you.

1167
01:26:42,402 --> 01:26:45,997
或是你也可以跟我一起走
Or, if you wanted to, you could come with me.

1168
01:26:46,173 --> 01:26:48,936
你可以自己决定，这就是我想讲的了
You're free to do what you want. That's what...

1169
01:26:49,117 --> 01:26:50,910
...I wanted to say to you.

1170
01:26:53,213 --> 01:26:55,601
我可以自己决定？　　对
-I'm free to do what I want? -Right.

1171
01:26:55,782 --> 01:26:58,639
我花了6个月时间试着离开你
I try to get away from you for months and I'm going with you on a trip?

1172
01:26:58,682 --> 01:27:00,639
现在却要我跟你一起离开？

1173
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,980
你要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

1174
01:27:03,157 --> 01:27:07,217
我还不知道，之前是说去阿尔及利亚
I don't know where yet. We said Algeria. I don't know.

1175
01:27:07,393 --> 01:27:09,519
可能是去阿尔及利亚吧
So I'll go to Algeria. I don't know yet.

1176
01:27:09,696 --> 01:27:12,255
为什么选阿尔及利亚？
Why are you going to Algeria?

1177
01:27:13,766 --> 01:27:16,825
我不知道，那里有一家强森饭店
I don't know why. They got a Howard Johnson's there.

1178
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:20,495
你疯了，知道吗？你真的疯了！
You're warped, you know that? You're really warped.

1179
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:22,495
我真的疯了！我知道
I'm warped. I know I'm warped.

1180
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:24,835
天啊！阿尔及利亚…
Algeria!

1181
01:27:27,914 --> 01:27:31,269
他们带着面具走路，头上又有怪东西
You know they walk around with masks on, things on their heads.

1182
01:27:31,451 --> 01:27:34,715
那边都是些疯子　　　那我该怎么办？
-They're a bunch of crazy people. -What am I supposed to do?

1183
01:27:34,888 --> 01:27:38,084
你可以选个好一点的地方　　　哪儿？
-You could have picked a better place. -Like where?

1184
01:27:38,259 --> 01:27:40,453
瑞士还是丹麦？
Sweden? Denmark?

1185
01:27:42,563 --> 01:27:44,655
对啊，那里不错
Yeah, like that.

1186
01:27:46,633 --> 01:27:49,795
沙尔想去怀俄明州
You know what? Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1187
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,167
天啊！那不是个国家，他不知道怀俄明在哪
I had to tell him it's not a country. He don't know where Wyoming is.

1188
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:56,536
我和不知怀俄明在哪的人一起打劫
I'm with a guy who don't know where Wyoming is. Think you got problems?

1189
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:58,036
有问题的人不只是你！

1190
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:03,412
那么…沙尔跟你一起
So, Sal is with you?

1191
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:04,708
喔我的天！
Oh, boy!

1192
01:28:04,885 --> 01:28:07,045
我看你们还是投降得好
You'd be better off giving up.

1193
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:11,476
我不会投降的，不然我何苦做这一切？
I'm not giving up, because why have I done this so far?

1194
01:28:11,658 --> 01:28:15,616
事情已经做到这个地步，现在何必投降？
I've gone so far with this, and why should I give up now?

1195
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:17,558
我怎么能投降？
I can't give up.

1196
01:28:20,434 --> 01:28:24,130
你可以帮我个忙吗？　　什么忙？
-Would you do me a favor? -Yeah, what?

1197
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:29,202
带我来这里的人
These guys that have me down here...

1198
01:28:31,445 --> 01:28:34,641
他们认为我是同谋
...they think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank.

1199
01:28:34,815 --> 01:28:38,602
怎么可能？太疯狂了
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy. They're bullshitting you.

1200
01:28:38,786 --> 01:28:40,673
他们在唬你，想要耍你
They're giving you a snow job.

1201
01:28:40,854 --> 01:28:43,515
他们的确说我是共犯　　　才不是…
They told me I was an accessory.

1202
01:28:43,691 --> 01:28:46,579
他们胡说八道，别相信
That's just a con job on you. Don't listen to that.

1203
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,786
我一定得听他们的…我在监狱里会活不下去
I have to listen to it. I can't survive in prison, Sonny.

1204
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:53,762
礼昂，你不可能会坐牢的　　　你怎么知道？
-You're not going to prison. -How do you know?

1205
01:28:53,934 --> 01:28:55,696
我就是知道，你不会坐牢的
Because I know. Believe me.

1206
01:28:55,869 --> 01:28:58,359
拜托…告诉他们　　　拜托什么？
Look, please, just tell them.

1207
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:00,028
告诉他们什么？
Tell them what?

1208
01:29:00,207 --> 01:29:02,128
告诉他们你我不是一伙的？
That you didn't do it?

1209
01:29:02,309 --> 01:29:05,539
他们现在在听电话吗？
Are they on the phone now?

1210
01:29:05,713 --> 01:29:06,701
对
Yeah.

1211
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,211
好极了！礼昂，真是好极了
That's great, Leon. That's really terrific.

1212
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:12,077
你跟我通话，还让他们监听，你可真聪明
You talk with them on the phone. Really smart!

1213
01:29:12,419 --> 01:29:14,374
我是被逼的　　　什么意思？
-I have no choice! -What do you mean?

1214
01:29:14,556 --> 01:29:18,514
你要我怎么办？我身边有七万多个警察围着
What am I supposed to do? There are 7,000 fucking cops all around me.

1215
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,850
谁在听电话？　　不要怪在我头上
-Who's on now? -Don't lay it on me!

1216
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:23,724
我没有怪你！可你知道他们在搞鬼吧？
I'm not, but you knew that was going on, right?

1217
01:29:23,964 --> 01:29:26,261
讲什么我怪你，你一定知发生什么事
You knew what was happening, right?

1218
01:29:26,433 --> 01:29:28,093
没错…可是我…
Yeah!

1219
01:29:28,268 --> 01:29:30,497
我只想知道谁在听电话？
I want to know who's on the phone now.

1220
01:29:32,507 --> 01:29:35,134
摩瑞提？摩瑞提，是你吗？
Moretti, is that you?

1221
01:29:36,276 --> 01:29:37,469
喂？

1222
01:29:39,681 --> 01:29:42,478
总有人说说话啊，他们还在听吗？
Will somebody talk to me? Somebody going to talk to me or what?

1223
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:44,415
他们还在听吗？
They on now?

1224
01:29:44,986 --> 01:29:46,783
他们不会跟你说话的
They won't talk to you.

1225
01:29:47,087 --> 01:29:49,243
好吧，他没参与这次的计划
He didn't do it, okay? He had nothing to do with it.

1226
01:29:49,287 --> 01:29:52,043
他跟这件事一点关系都没有

1227
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,283
可以了吧？
Will you get off the phone?

1228
01:29:53,528 --> 01:29:56,018
你们可以挂了吧？他们挂了吗？

1229
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,051
Are they off?

1230
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:01,489
嗯
That really convinced them. They wanted to know. Did I do it for you?

1231
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:03,402
他们应该相信你了吧

1232
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:06,402
这是他们要知道的，我帮你洗清罪名

1233
01:30:06,574 --> 01:30:08,734
谢谢你
Yeah, thanks. Thank you very much.

1234
01:30:10,745 --> 01:30:13,110
你现在要怎么办？
So now what? What are you going to do?

1235
01:30:13,281 --> 01:30:15,271
我想…
I thought...

1236
01:30:16,618 --> 01:30:18,778
我想我会回去医院
...that I would go back to the hospital.

1237
01:30:18,953 --> 01:30:23,241
他们人很好，也有心要帮我
They're really nice there. They seem like they're trying to help me.

1238
01:30:23,425 --> 01:30:26,018
你已经找到你要的东西了
That's good, then. You found something.

1239
01:30:26,494 --> 01:30:28,825
我也不太确定
I don't know if I have or not.

1240
01:30:30,765 --> 01:30:32,322
所以…你还是会去动手术吧？
Are you still going to have the operation?

1241
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:35,032
会呀，当然会
Yeah!

1242
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:39,029
我还应该跟你说什么？
So then, what am I supposed to say to you?

1243
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,841
谢谢你
Thanks a lot...

1244
01:30:48,918 --> 01:30:50,145
还有…祝你一路顺风
...and bon voyage.

1245
01:30:51,453 --> 01:30:54,341
有缘再见面　　　是啊
Yeah, right. See you sometime.

1246
01:30:54,789 --> 01:30:56,551
我会在梦里见到你的
I'll see you in my dreams.

1247
01:30:56,725 --> 01:30:58,851
我会写首歌的
Right, I'll write a song.

1248
01:31:02,564 --> 01:31:06,260
知道吗…人生有时真有趣　　　你说过很多次了
-I don't know. Life's so funny. -You said a mouthful, sweetheart.

1249
01:31:12,874 --> 01:31:13,862
那…拜拜了
Goodbye, huh?

1250
01:31:44,973 --> 01:31:47,497
哈　　　可不可以给我…
Give me.... Can I have--

1251
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:52,101
你们把银行电话全掐了，能否给我一支分线？
You cut off the incoming calls. Can I have a line?

1252
01:31:52,281 --> 01:31:54,805
我要打电话给我老婆跟小孩
I want to talk to my wife and to my kids.

1253
01:31:54,984 --> 01:31:57,315
他要一支可以打出去的电话
He wants an outside line, is it all right?

1254
01:31:58,687 --> 01:32:00,415
给我接另一条线
I want a line.

1255
01:32:00,589 --> 01:32:01,953
好，我马上处理
I'm getting it.

1256
01:32:03,259 --> 01:32:06,955
你知道吗？我可以打电话给任何人
I could call anybody, they'd put them on the phone.

1257
01:32:07,129 --> 01:32:09,016
教宗、太空人…
The Pope, an astronaut...

1258
01:32:10,032 --> 01:32:11,794
智者中的智者
...the wisest of the wise.

1259
01:32:13,335 --> 01:32:15,029
结果我居然得打给那个女人
Who do I have to call?

1260
01:32:17,339 --> 01:32:19,636
我不知道该怎么办？
I just don't know what to do.

1261
01:32:26,749 --> 01:32:28,272
喂？　　嘿，安祺
Angie.

1262
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:31,280
桑尼，天啊，我看到新闻了
Jesus! I was watching it on TV.

1263
01:32:31,454 --> 01:32:35,219
小孩在哪？　　他们还不知道我叫他们去邻居家
-Where are the kids? -I sent them to the neighbors.

1264
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:39,850
桑尼，我真的不敢相信…这不像你啊
I can't believe! I mean, it ain't like you.

1265
01:32:40,095 --> 01:32:41,152
我知道
I know.

1266
01:32:41,331 --> 01:32:44,163
你从来不会这样的，你从没伤害过任何人
You've never done anything like it before on your life.

1267
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:47,029
你知道吗？我快死了，我快死在这里了
I'm dying, you know that? I'm dying here.

1268
01:32:47,203 --> 01:32:51,935
桑尼，我一直怪自己，我知道你最近一直心神不宁
I blame myself. I notice you been tense, like something is happening.

1269
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:55,270
你前天像疯了似的骂小孩
Like that night you're yelling at the kids like a madman.

1270
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:57,001
还叫我去
Then you want me to go...

1271
01:32:57,179 --> 01:32:59,976
坐小孩的云霄飞车
...on that ride, here to there, full of those kids.

1272
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:03,607
这太疯狂了，我不想去
It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go, so you yell at me...

1273
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:08,177
你还骂我，逼我上去
..."You pig, get on the fucking ride! " Everything fell out of me.

1274
01:33:08,358 --> 01:33:11,781
我的心都碎了，整个人都崩溃了
My heart, my liver, just fell to the floor. Everything!

1275
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:15,727
你知道我的感受吗？你当着这么多人骂我
You know what it felt like? You yelling at me in front of all those people?

1276
01:33:15,931 --> 01:33:18,296
因为你从来也没这样对我过
You never talked to me like that before.

1277
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:22,329
我以为你会杀了我，然后把尸体丢到河里
I think, "He's going to shoot me and dump my body in the river. "

1278
01:33:22,505 --> 01:33:24,335
安祺，闭嘴　　　我是说我好怕你…
I was scared of you!

1279
01:33:24,507 --> 01:33:29,170
我怕死你了…　　你给我闭嘴，听我说…
Will you shut the fuck up and listen to me? Just listen to me!

1280
01:33:29,345 --> 01:33:32,177
你看，又是这样，满口的脏话
You see that? With the language?

1281
01:33:32,349 --> 01:33:34,839
我是想跟你说话，但你…
I'm trying to talk to you, and you--

1282
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,815
我想我无法跟你说话！
A person can't communicate with you!

1283
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:40,849
你把我当成什么？我是你老婆…
What am I here? I'm your wife. I'm your wife!

1284
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:44,255
你伤了我，你知道吗？
You know something? You hurt me.

1285
01:33:44,426 --> 01:33:48,555
你伤透我了，你竟跑去与男人结婚？
You hurt me, you know that? Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1286
01:33:48,732 --> 01:33:51,154
我做错了什么？
Did I ever do anything to make you do that?

1287
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:54,291
我有拒绝过你吗？
Did I ever turn you down or anything?

1288
01:33:54,471 --> 01:33:56,495
我只不过肥了点
I know I let myself get fat.

1289
01:33:56,673 --> 01:34:00,460
别说你胖，别这么说　　　你无法忍受我肥胖
-Don't call yourself fat. -You can't stand me to say it.

1290
01:34:00,643 --> 01:34:04,738
就像我无法忍受你抢银行，桑尼，这才是爱！
Like I can't stand you being a bank robber. That's what love is.

1291
01:34:04,915 --> 01:34:06,677
喔，你知道什么是爱？
Yeah? You know what love is?

1292
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:10,543
既然你这么清楚，为什么不过来？
If you know what love is so much, why didn't you come down here?

1293
01:34:12,455 --> 01:34:14,945
跟我谈爱，再说啊
Talk to me about love, go ahead.

1294
01:34:15,659 --> 01:34:17,057
桑尼，我好害怕…
Sonny, I'm scared.

1295
01:34:17,294 --> 01:34:20,217
我好害怕…他们会不会枪毙我？
I'm scared. Are they going to shoot me or something?

1296
01:34:20,397 --> 01:34:21,795
他们才不会枪毙你
No, they're not!

1297
01:34:21,965 --> 01:34:26,162
你该看电视，他们有大跑、冲锋枪，样样俱全
You should see it on the TV. They got cannons, machine guns.

1298
01:34:26,336 --> 01:34:27,859
他们要抓的是我不是你
They're after me, Angie, not you.

1299
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:31,183
我好晚才知道你和沙尔出事了
It's late already by the time I find out...

1300
01:34:31,204 --> 01:34:34,233
我找不到保母，怎么去见你？
...it's just you and Sal. I can't get a babysitter! What'll I do?

1301
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,137
听着

1302
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:09,641
我必须带他回去检查心脏
I think I better take him back for a cardiac check.

1303
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:24,514
他怎么了？会死吗？　　不是不是…
What's the matter? He going to die or what?

1304
01:35:25,096 --> 01:35:29,088
只是要预防一下，这儿太暖了
It's just a precautionary measure. It's awfully warm in here.

1305
01:35:41,979 --> 01:35:44,503
好吧，带他出去
All right, then. Let's go, let him out.

1306
01:35:45,383 --> 01:35:47,338
我不去，我还好
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1307
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:49,608
帮我打针就好
I just needed the injection.

1308
01:35:50,021 --> 01:35:54,343
你干嘛？想逞英雄？你看起来不太好，还是出去吧
You trying to be a hero? You don't look good. We'll let you out.

1309
01:35:54,525 --> 01:35:55,889
我不是逞强
I'm not trying to be anything.

1310
01:35:57,294 --> 01:36:00,182
我只想自己一个人，可以吗？
I just want to be left alone.

1311
01:36:01,899 --> 01:36:04,890
没人吵你啊　　　我希望你从没进过这间银行
-No one is bothering you. -I wish to fuck you never came!

1312
01:36:05,936 --> 01:36:07,197
就这样
That's all.

1313
01:36:07,471 --> 01:36:10,826
你不用假惺惺装好人
Don't try to act like you're an angel of human kindness.

1314
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:19,942
出柜上街头！出柜上街头！
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1315
01:36:24,489 --> 01:36:27,150
出柜上街头！…
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1316
01:36:45,743 --> 01:36:50,338
桑尼万岁！…
Sonny all the way! Sonny all the way!

1317
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:20,738
女士们
Ladies!

1318
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,241
女士们

1319
01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:28,409
请原谅我刚刚用的字眼
I want to apologize for my use of language back there.

1320
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,051
为什么？你刚说了什么？
Why? What did you say?

1321
01:37:37,796 --> 01:37:40,492
他说了什么？　　他骂脏话
What?

1322
01:37:38,985 --> 01:37:40,528
He said the 'F' word.

1323
01:37:40,665 --> 01:37:42,325
啊？　　他说什么？
What did he say?

1324
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:44,092
他骂脏话
He said the 'F' word.

1325
01:37:50,942 --> 01:37:53,774
可恶！　　我知道，玛莉安
-Fuck. -I know, Miriam!

1326
01:37:56,748 --> 01:38:00,478
我是基督教徒，不能听这些字眼
I'm a Christian and my ears are not garbage cans.

1327
01:38:02,954 --> 01:38:04,284
别这样嘛…

1328
01:38:08,026 --> 01:38:11,222
我们不要管他们了　　　那就别管他们了
-Then we shouldn't go after them. -Then we won't.

1329
01:38:11,396 --> 01:38:13,022
怎么了？　　桑尼…
What's that?

1330
01:38:13,999 --> 01:38:15,989
桑尼，你可否出来一下？
Could you come out, please?

1331
01:38:19,671 --> 01:38:20,796
是我妈
My mother.

1332
01:38:21,006 --> 01:38:22,131
桑尼

1333
01:38:22,674 --> 01:38:24,834
有人来看你了，桑尼？
Someone here to see you.

1334
01:38:25,177 --> 01:38:27,098
可否出来一下？
Could you come out, please?

1335
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,237
桑尼

1336
01:38:31,117 --> 01:38:33,038
桑尼，出来一下
Sonny, could you come out, please?

1337
01:38:38,291 --> 01:38:39,552
你们看到那女人吗？

1338
01:38:40,259 --> 01:38:42,886
妈，你来干嘛？
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1339
01:38:43,629 --> 01:38:46,290
我不要你在这儿　　　喔，桑尼…
I don't need you down here.

1340
01:38:46,499 --> 01:38:49,797
布鲁克林的人都在这，还有三家电视台采访
All of Brooklyn is out here. Three networks of television.

1341
01:38:50,202 --> 01:38:53,898
我知道怎么做，别担心　　　我刚跟FBI谈过…
-I got it all worked out, Ma. -I talked to the man from the FBI.

1342
01:38:54,139 --> 01:38:56,698
你跟谁谈过？不要跟任何人讲话　　　他说…
Who? No, don't talk to anybody.

1343
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:59,934
他说你要是现在出来，就会没事了
He says if you come out now, everything is going to be all right.

1344
01:39:00,478 --> 01:39:02,866
我只是想帮你　　　不要跟调查局的人说话
-I'm trying to get you out of this. -Don't talk to the FBI.

1345
01:39:03,148 --> 01:39:04,239
我全告诉他们了
I told them everything...

1346
01:39:04,483 --> 01:39:09,579
包括你在越战的事，还有你以前工作表现一向很好
...how you were in the war in Vietnam, I told them you always had good jobs.

1347
01:39:09,755 --> 01:39:12,712
我还说你64年和高华德参加党大会…
I told them you were with Goldwater in '64 in the convention and--

1348
01:39:12,924 --> 01:39:15,915
妈，听我说，我就要坐飞机去阿尔及利亚
Listen, I'm getting a plane and I'm going to Algeria.

1349
01:39:16,095 --> 01:39:18,460
我会写信给你的　　　阿尔及利亚？
I'll write you from there.

1350
01:39:18,631 --> 01:39:21,053
我必须离开这里　　　真搞不懂你
-I've got to go! -I don't understand you.

1351
01:39:21,267 --> 01:39:22,755
如果我留在里跟你间聊
If I stay and talk to you, they won't send the limousine.

1352
01:39:22,767 --> 01:39:25,555
他们就不会派车子载我们去机场

1353
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:30,195
他们会以为我要投降　　　投降又会怎么样？
-They'll think I'll come out with you. -What's the matter with that?

1354
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:35,039
调查局的人什么都了解，他们知道不是你的错…
Because I'm not coming with you.

1355
01:39:31,112 --> 01:39:35,699
The FBI understands everything, that it is not you that is doing this.

1356
01:39:35,213 --> 01:39:38,272
他们知道你是因为家里的压力大
It's the pressures from your home life!

1357
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:42,346
别把安祺扯进来…　　我有说她的坏话吗？
-Don't get on Angie now. -Did I say one word against her?

1358
01:39:42,521 --> 01:39:45,546
你的人生　　　安祺没有错，是我错
You were going to. She has nothing to do with it, it's me!

1359
01:39:45,725 --> 01:39:48,557
本来你的人生是美好的
Your life was sweetness and roses.

1360
01:39:49,195 --> 01:39:53,756
要不是安祺你也不会跟礼昂在一起，这你也知道
You wouldn't need Leon if Angie was treating you right, you know that!

1361
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,696
我不懂你为什么要跟她在一起
I don't understand why you want to sleep with her anyway.

1362
01:39:57,870 --> 01:40:00,201
你有两个小孩在领福利金
You got 2 kids on welfare now.

1363
01:40:00,373 --> 01:40:02,764
难不成你想跟她再生一个？
-You want 3 kids on welfare? -I can't talk to you about this now.

1364
01:40:02,773 --> 01:40:05,264
妈，现在不是谈这个的时候

1365
01:40:05,444 --> 01:40:07,968
妈，拜托…　　你现在要怎么办？出来啊！出来
What are you going to do? Come out.

1366
01:40:08,147 --> 01:40:11,240
我不能出来，我不能，沙尔和人质都在里面
I can't come out. I can't.

1367
01:40:09,683 --> 01:40:11,434
Sal is in there with the people.

1368
01:40:11,417 --> 01:40:13,907
要是我出来，沙尔会杀了他们的　　　老天啊
If I come out, he's going to kill them.

1369
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:16,717
跑！跑！　　跑？
Run!

1370
01:40:16,889 --> 01:40:19,118
跑！　　我能跑去哪儿？我不能跑
Run? Where am I going to run? Ma, I can't run!

1371
01:40:19,292 --> 01:40:22,317
或许…我想应该…　　我跑不了的，妈，拜托
-Maybe-- -There's no maybe. No maybes.

1372
01:40:22,528 --> 01:40:25,519
妈，求求你回家，爸呢？他没有来这儿吧？
You got to go home. Where's Pop? He didn't come, did he?

1373
01:40:25,931 --> 01:40:29,593
没，他在生你气，他说他没有你这种儿子！
Is he pissed off at you! He says he doesn't have a son.

1374
01:40:29,803 --> 01:40:32,134
他说你已经死了　　　他是对的
-He says you're dead. -He's right.

1375
01:40:33,407 --> 01:40:36,295
我是个没用的边缘人
I'm a fuck-up and an outcast and that's it.

1376
01:40:36,642 --> 01:40:40,065
接近我的人都会倒霉
You come near me, you're going to get fucked over and fucked out!

1377
01:40:40,246 --> 01:40:43,237
我必须要走了，麻烦带她回家，好吗？
Now, I got to go, Ma. Get her home, okay?

1378
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:44,940
带她回家
Just take her home.

1379
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:47,881
你知道你小时候有多可爱吗？
How beautiful you were when you were a baby!

1380
01:40:48,054 --> 01:40:51,147
现在就回家去！带她回去！

1381
01:40:49,922 --> 01:40:51,673
Get her home now!

1382
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:02,792
（十分钟）
Ten minutes.

1383
01:41:18,919 --> 01:41:21,409
我在身心
Being of sound mind...

1384
01:41:21,588 --> 01:41:23,111
健全的状况下…
...and body....

1385
01:41:23,957 --> 01:41:25,617
你知道怎么写吧？
You know what they....

1386
01:41:35,969 --> 01:41:38,095
给我亲爱的太太
To my darling wife...

1387
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:40,496
礼昂
...Leon...

1388
01:41:44,478 --> 01:41:46,240
我爱你…
...whom I love...

1389
01:41:50,484 --> 01:41:52,405
世界上
...more than any man...

1390
01:41:52,754 --> 01:41:54,345
无人能比
...has loved another man...

1391
01:41:56,089 --> 01:41:57,578
直到永远…
...in all eternity.

1392
01:42:02,530 --> 01:42:03,894
我留下了…
I leave...

1393
01:42:05,766 --> 01:42:08,620
两千七百元
...$2,700...

1394
01:42:11,238 --> 01:42:14,627
是从我的寿险理赔金里拿出来的
...from my $10,000 life insurance policy...

1395
01:42:18,646 --> 01:42:20,078
就当做…
...to be used...

1396
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:24,208
你的变性手术费用
...for your sex change operation.

1397
01:42:30,757 --> 01:42:33,748
如果有剩…
If there is any money left over...

1398
01:42:36,897 --> 01:42:38,989
全都给你
...I want it to go to you...

1399
01:42:41,836 --> 01:42:43,666
在我的…
...at my first...

1400
01:42:45,071 --> 01:42:48,528
我的一周年忌日
...at the first anniversary of my death...

1401
01:42:48,708 --> 01:42:50,402
别忘了来看我
...at my grave.

1402
01:42:59,954 --> 01:43:01,648
给我的老婆…
To my wife...

1403
01:43:02,088 --> 01:43:03,952
亲爱的老婆
...to my sweet wife...

1404
01:43:05,259 --> 01:43:06,657
安祺
...Angela...

1405
01:43:10,064 --> 01:43:13,590
我理赔金中的五千元是要给你的
...$5,000 from the same policy.

1406
01:43:19,073 --> 01:43:21,233
你是我唯一
You are the only woman...

1407
01:43:21,509 --> 01:43:23,464
爱过的女人
...that I ever loved.

1408
01:43:29,015 --> 01:43:31,903
我在此令人鼻酸的一刻
And I repledge my love to you...

1409
01:43:34,255 --> 01:43:36,052
重申对你的爱
...in this sad moment.

1410
01:43:43,831 --> 01:43:46,560
给金咪
To little Kimmy...

1411
01:43:48,069 --> 01:43:49,330
与提米
...and Timmy.

1412
01:43:51,272 --> 01:43:53,569
提米，希望你能记得我
I hope you remember me, Timmy.

1413
01:43:57,211 --> 01:43:59,371
你现在是这个家里的男人了
You're the little man of the family now...

1414
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:11,552
希望你能代我照顾这个家
...and I hope you look after them for me.

1415
01:44:15,897 --> 01:44:17,227
我亲爱的妈妈
To my mother...

1416
01:44:21,469 --> 01:44:23,231
原谅我
...I ask forgiveness.

1417
01:44:28,376 --> 01:44:30,764
你无法了解…
You don't understand...

1418
01:44:33,549 --> 01:44:35,379
我的言语
...the things I said...

1419
01:44:36,919 --> 01:44:38,283
和行为
...and did.

1420
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:44,017
我就是我，我与众不同
But I'm me and I'm different.

1421
01:44:50,666 --> 01:44:53,156
我希望能有个军队仪式葬礼
I want a military funeral...

1422
01:44:58,072 --> 01:45:01,336
我有权要求免费下葬
...and I'm entitled to have one, free of charge.

1423
01:45:08,517 --> 01:45:09,744
愿上帝保佑你
God bless you...

1424
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,577
看顾你…
...and watch over you...

1425
01:45:17,593 --> 01:45:20,186
直到我们再相会
...till we are joined in the hereafter.

1426
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:37,834
我来签名
Here, I'll sign. I'll spell that last name.

1427
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,045
小心
Watch out!

1428
01:45:45,487 --> 01:45:48,011
小心…

1429
01:45:52,862 --> 01:45:54,749
别这样嘛！探长，一张照片就好
Come on, Sarge, just one picture?

1430
01:46:02,471 --> 01:46:04,131
退后！退后！
Back, back!

1431
01:46:33,803 --> 01:46:35,758
你是司机？　　是的
You the driver?

1432
01:46:38,775 --> 01:46:40,605
我想检查一下
I want to check it out.

1433
01:46:44,947 --> 01:46:47,574
这椅子可以拿下来？　　不行，固定住了
Seats come out?

1434
01:46:46,401 --> 01:46:47,568
They're bolted.

1435
01:46:55,191 --> 01:46:57,954
好吧！灯从那边照过来
All right, here. Light me on that side.

1436
01:46:59,429 --> 01:47:00,452
照那边
Over there.

1437
01:47:13,875 --> 01:47:16,240
啊，你就是那个男的
You're the man, huh?

1438
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,968
我刚看到报导
I was watching. I saw you, man!

1439
01:47:21,484 --> 01:47:24,543
你应该看看，你不会相信
You should see yourself, you wouldn't believe it!

1440
01:47:24,721 --> 01:47:26,210
我相信
I believe it.

1441
01:47:26,389 --> 01:47:27,821
但是席拉绝不会相信的
Sheila won't!

1442
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:30,056
谁是席拉？　　我妈
-Who? -My old lady!

1443
01:47:30,226 --> 01:47:33,524
他们打电话来，叫我到公园西路258号
They said, "Gas up a stretch, go to 285 Prospect Park West. "

1444
01:47:33,696 --> 01:47:35,060
灯光照过来点
Give me some light over here.

1445
01:47:36,099 --> 01:47:38,862
我以为又是一堆…从按摩院出来的客人
I said, "Shit, another load from the massage parlors! "

1446
01:47:56,285 --> 01:47:57,444
没问题了
It's okay.

1447
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,881
我一定会记得你
I'm going to remember you.

1448
01:48:06,996 --> 01:48:09,589
这是墨飞探员，他来开车
This is Agent Murphy. He'll be your driver.

1449
01:48:09,966 --> 01:48:11,330
不，我要他
No, I want him.

1450
01:48:13,503 --> 01:48:16,596
我要这个黑人　　　我才不要这浑水
-Give me the black guy. -I'm not into that shit.

1451
01:48:16,873 --> 01:48:18,134
别这样，没人会伤害你的
Nobody will hurt you.

1452
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:21,929
没有人会被杀，要杀早杀了，还等现在？
If they were going to shoot, they would've shot already.

1453
01:48:22,146 --> 01:48:24,739
我不答应　　　你不答应？
-I can't allow that, Sonny. -You can't allow?

1454
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:28,436
你谁啊？这里我下命令
What makes you think you can say shit to me? I'm running this.

1455
01:48:29,987 --> 01:48:31,817
我会付钱的，你要多少，一百元？
I'll pay you. What do you want? $100? $200?

1456
01:48:31,989 --> 01:48:34,479
两百元？一千元？怎样？
$1,000? Come on.

1457
01:48:35,559 --> 01:48:37,514
别看他，我才是老大
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1458
01:48:38,829 --> 01:48:40,125
来嘛！

1459
01:48:42,165 --> 01:48:43,654
会很好玩喔
Look, it'll be an adventure.

1460
01:48:49,238 --> 01:48:52,365
要杀杀白人，别杀我
You men that shoot, aim for white meat.

1461
01:49:00,651 --> 01:49:01,708
你走吧
Take a walk.

1462
01:49:03,887 --> 01:49:04,875
我要他
Give me him.

1463
01:49:07,223 --> 01:49:09,554
你以为你在跟白痴谈判啊？
Think I'm an idiot?

1464
01:49:11,195 --> 01:49:12,559
滚，条子！
Take a walk, cop!

1465
01:49:17,768 --> 01:49:19,962
大家都想耍老千
Everybody is a con man.

1466
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:26,770
我要所有人都到对面去
I want everyone across the street.

1467
01:49:28,545 --> 01:49:30,967
退到对面去
I want them all back, on the sidewalk!

1468
01:49:31,281 --> 01:49:33,009
快呀
Let's go!

1469
01:49:33,317 --> 01:49:35,910
至少我知道我面对的人是谁
At least I know who I'm dealing with now.

1470
01:49:38,789 --> 01:49:40,813
这支笔给你
Here's a pen for you. Come on!

1471
01:49:51,435 --> 01:49:53,265
站在这儿别动
Don't move, okay?

1472
01:49:57,007 --> 01:49:59,861
桑尼，你的文件
Here's your document.

1473
01:50:01,511 --> 01:50:03,842
谢谢　　　你必须签名
-Thanks. -You've got to sign it!

1474
01:50:06,517 --> 01:50:07,949
准备走了
We're taking off.

1475
01:50:08,119 --> 01:50:09,813
我们要走了
We're going now.

1476
01:50:10,088 --> 01:50:12,476
沙尔，他在哪儿？沙尔…
Sal! Where is he?

1477
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,049
沙尔

1478
01:50:14,292 --> 01:50:16,316
就这样，我们要上路了
That's it, we're going.

1479
01:50:16,861 --> 01:50:18,953
各位，要上路了
Here, people, let's go! We're going.

1480
01:50:19,597 --> 01:50:23,521
我可以拿我的毛衣吗？　　拿你该拿的
-Can I get my sweater? -Get what you had when you came in.

1481
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:34,199
沙尔

1482
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:38,036
沙尔

1483
01:50:41,185 --> 01:50:42,515
你还好吧？
How are you doing?

1484
01:50:42,686 --> 01:50:43,913
还好　　　还好？
Good.

1485
01:50:44,088 --> 01:50:46,578
我们要上路了，好吗？
We're going to do it, right?

1486
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:48,782
我们要上路了，沙尔，你看
We're going to do it.

1487
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,656
注意看着他，他是司机
You got to keep your eye on him. He's the driver.

1488
01:50:51,829 --> 01:50:54,160
我需要这把枪　　　不，这是我的
-I need it. -No, it's mine.

1489
01:50:54,532 --> 01:50:56,761
你要看好这小子
You got to keep your eye on him, see?

1490
01:51:01,606 --> 01:51:03,493
现在怎么办？
All right, where am I now?

1491
01:52:01,032 --> 01:52:02,555
等一下
All right, hold it!

1492
01:52:04,236 --> 01:52:06,226
好了，可以走了
All right, let's go.

1493
01:52:06,404 --> 01:52:08,769
转过来…
Swing around now.

1494
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:11,938
手不要放开
Just keep holding hands.

1495
01:52:18,283 --> 01:52:19,306
等一下
Hold it!

1496
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:23,812
数到三就放手，还不要放手…
Break it on "3. " Not yet, don't break it.

1497
01:52:24,723 --> 01:52:25,711
一

1498
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:27,613

1499
01:52:28,293 --> 01:52:29,384
三，进车子里
Go!

1500
01:52:40,873 --> 01:52:42,999
我们成功了！
Fuck, we did it!

1501
01:52:43,242 --> 01:52:44,435
我们成功了！
We did it!

1502
01:52:44,643 --> 01:52:45,904
祝我们好运！
Wish us luck!

1503
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:49,003
再见

1504
01:52:50,949 --> 01:52:52,381
我放了一人质了
You got your one.

1505
01:52:53,018 --> 01:52:54,279
跟着我的车
Follow my car.

1506
01:53:06,865 --> 01:53:09,162
帮我接甘尼迪机场　　　沙尔…
Get me Kennedy.

1507
01:53:09,768 --> 01:53:11,132
沙尔，我们成功了！
We did it!

1508
01:53:13,172 --> 01:53:15,731
我们成功了！
I'll be a son of a bitch! We did it!

1509
01:53:15,908 --> 01:53:19,138
按喇叭，我们走吧！
Okay, let's move. Come on, honk the horn.

1510
01:53:21,648 --> 01:53:23,945
沙尔，帮个忙
Do me a favor, will you?

1511
01:53:24,116 --> 01:53:27,073
把枪指别的地方，如果路上颠簸，枪容易走火
Keep the gun pointed up. We hit a bump, it'll go off.

1512
01:53:37,429 --> 01:53:38,690
你们好了吗？
You set out there?

1513
01:53:42,235 --> 01:53:44,032
我们要准备离开这儿
We're leaving now.

1514
01:53:44,403 --> 01:53:46,290
一路上不准有任何的麻烦
We want no trouble en route.

1515
01:53:49,174 --> 01:53:50,470
路口都安排好了？
Intersection check?

1516
01:53:53,179 --> 01:53:55,203
好…我们现在就要出发
We'll be starting up right now.

1518
01:54:28,648 --> 01:54:30,046
会没事的
It'll be all right.

1519
01:54:56,042 --> 01:55:00,536
沙尔，你一定要记得要把枪口向上

1520
01:54:57,816 --> 01:55:00,818
You just have to remember to keep the gun pointed up.

1521
01:57:27,628 --> 01:57:28,958
他在那里干嘛？
What's he doing?

1522
01:57:29,363 --> 01:57:31,785
他在安排事情
He's still got some arrangements to make.

1523
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:46,203
就是这架？没错！

1524
01:57:47,682 --> 01:57:50,411
沙尔，看到没？就是那架飞机
Sal, see it? There it is.

1525
01:58:47,276 --> 01:58:48,936
糟糕
I forgot!

1526
01:58:49,110 --> 01:58:51,304
我忘了问上面有没有吃的
I forgot to ask if they got food on board.

1527
01:58:56,152 --> 01:58:57,550
上面会有食物吗？
Do they have food on board?

1528
01:59:04,193 --> 01:59:05,352
看，那就是你要求的飞机
Your jet.

1529
01:59:05,527 --> 01:59:08,290
人质呢？我们约定好的　　　对
We get one more now. That's the deal.

1530
01:59:09,063 --> 01:59:11,951
好，谁要走？　　苏菲雅？
Right. Okay, who goes?

1531
01:59:10,674 --> 01:59:11,759

我会帮你们祷告的
I'll pray for you.

1534
01:59:25,681 --> 01:59:26,772
沙尔

1535
01:59:27,683 --> 01:59:29,946
第一次坐飞机…
Because this is your first plane trip...

1536
01:59:30,119 --> 01:59:32,541
不要太害怕
...don't be scared, okay?

1537
01:59:46,235 --> 01:59:49,362
我刚才想起我一整天都没吃，飞机上会有食物吗？
I didn't eat all day. Will there be any food on board?

1538
01:59:49,537 --> 01:59:51,697
飞机上有汉堡，准备好了吗？
There'll be hamburgers. Ready?

1539
01:59:54,510 --> 01:59:56,773
沙尔　　　怎样？

1540
01:59:57,079 --> 01:59:58,102
要走了喔
Ready to go?

1541
01:59:59,347 --> 02:00:00,438
好啊
Yeah.

1542

好，我们走吧
Let's move.

1543
02:00:09,792 --> 02:00:11,019
沙尔

1544
02:00:12,061 --> 02:00:15,188
我们不想这时候出意外
We don't want any accidents at this point, right?

1545
02:00:15,598 --> 02:00:17,360
记得把枪口朝上
Keep your gun pointed up.

1546
02:00:19,635 --> 02:00:22,592
你要第一个出来吗？　　我准备好了
Ready to get out first?

1547
02:00:21,854 --> 02:00:22,729
Ready.
