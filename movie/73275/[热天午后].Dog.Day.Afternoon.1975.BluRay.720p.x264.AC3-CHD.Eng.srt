1
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,958
It has to be from downtown.

2
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,671
It's handled through this office,
but it requires downtown approval.

3
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,300
I don't know.

4
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,430
It has been submitted.

5
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,174
Sylvia, can you help me with this?

6
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,884
Coming.

7
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,111
Closing time. Going in?

8
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,489
Yes, sir.

9
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,919
You the manager?

10
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,802
Keep talking like nothing was wrong.

11
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,972
Let me call you back.

12
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,689
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

13
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,610
What are you talking about?

14
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,197
Maybe we should take
something smaller.

15
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,953
You crazy? He started already.
He's got the gun out.

16
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,872
Go on, go over by the door.

17
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,752
Get over by the door.

18
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:07,720
Freeze!

19
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,264
-Nobody move!
-Get over there!

20
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,351
Get away from those alarms.

21
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,479
Now get in the center.

22
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,607
He moves, shoot him!

23
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,526
Put the gun on him!
Get out in the center.

24
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,947
I can't do it, Sonny.

25
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,243
I'm not going to make it.

26
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:34,497
What? Put it on him.

27
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,248
I can't do it.

28
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,417
Fuck me! Sal!

29
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,339
-What?
-Where are you? He can't make it.

30
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,715
Fuck him. Let him go!

31
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,092
Come on!

32
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,430
All right, let him out.

33
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,058
Do what the gentleman says.

34
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,810
Let him out.

35
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,356
I'm sorry.

36
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,358
Shit!

37
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,986
-Don't take the car.
-How do I get home?

38
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,574
Take the subway.
We need the car.

39
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,493
The keys!

40
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,205
I'm sorry, Sonny.

41
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,832
All right, lock it.

42
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,130
What?

43
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,925
There's a girl
under that desk over there.

44
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,942
We got rid of him.
So now we just move it along.

45
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,235
You got them?

46
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,321
Now what did he say to me?
Wait a minute.

47
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,532
Anybody here?
What's this, a squirrel?

48
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:52,700
Hey, you!

49
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,951
Come on.

50
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,496
In the back there.
No one's going to hurt you.

51
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,623
Go ahead, get to the back.

52
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,792
Pull the drapes!

53
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,008
You, to the back here.

54
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,093
Go to him, right there.

55
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:15,181
We're going to move this now.
Just move it along.

56
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,434
Gotcha!

57
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:23,147
We're moving right along, folks. Going
to get this thing done in half an hour.

58
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,357
We just got to block....

59
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,989
Knock out the TV.

60
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,365
There we go.

61
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,201
See?

62
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,286
No replay, folks. No alarms.

63
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,663
Let's get you fixed up
and on your way.

64
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,500
-Is the vault open?
-I can take care of that.

65
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,752
Good. Let's go.
Take care of it.

66
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,674
Wait! What are you trying to do?

67
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:53,177
Trip the alarm?
Use the spot key?

68
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,388
I was out of my mind.

69
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,015
Get your mind right!

70
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,185
I'm a Catholic.
I don't want to hurt anybody!

71
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,229
-Yes, sir.
-No alarms.

72
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,313
No alarms!

73
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,232
No games.

74
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,693
Use the other one.

75
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,154
Miriam...

76
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:13,906
...open the safe.

77
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,509
Put it in this.

78
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,151
What?

79
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,695
That's all there is.

80
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,949
What are you saying?

81
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,785
They picked it up today.
There's only $1 ,1 00.

82
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,745
-It's true.
-He'll shoot me!

83
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't believe it.

84
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,836
I can't believe it!

85
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,922
There's no money here.

86
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:15,426
-Come on, Sonny, let's do it!
-I'm doing it!

87
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,597
Too much! This is too much.

88
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,143
All right, come on. Let's go.

89
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,772
You answer it.
Watch him, Sal.

90
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,066
You, come with me.
Watch him!

91
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,237
-Sit down.
-Who's the head teller here?

92
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:36,447
I am.

93
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,621
Open it up.

94
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,417
No, not all of it.

95
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,712
I worked in a bank.
I know the alarms. All right?

96
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:52,645
Don't play games with me.

97
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,966
You take one of these,
go like this...

98
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,843
...in here, and out it comes.

99
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,261
You got your 1 00.

100
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:00,638
I'll call back.

101
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,601
No, it's decoy money.
It's marked.

102
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,520
It's shit.

103
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,063
See?

104
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,819
Cheer up, you'll be
the veterans of a robbery.

105
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,780
You know the bank
sends you a dozen red roses?

106
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,741
Let him answer it.

107
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,454
Fucker! Don't get ideas.

108
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,623
I bark, that man there...he bites!

109
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,041
I'm on your side.

110
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,334
On my side, shit!

111
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,088
Listen, we got young girls here.
You could watch your language.

112
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,802
I speak what I feel.

113
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:43,472
Watch my language!
Empty the drawer out.

114
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,226
You'd have to find out from him.

115
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,311
Traveler's checks...

116
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,064
...and register.

117
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,234
The register!

118
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,613
You've got it.
All right, let's go.

119
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,033
I'll take that from you.

120
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,162
All right, Sal, here we go.

121
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,552
Come on.

122
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,601
What are you doing?

123
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,978
I'm burning the register here.

124
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,650
Moving right along, folks.

125
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:41,489
We're leaving.

126
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,365
Let me have the keys.

127
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,284
Give him the keys.

128
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,874
Nobody will hurt you.
We're going to leave.

129
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,840
Who's that?

130
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:03,636
The insurance guy from across
the street. He probably saw the smoke.

131
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,105
Please, put out the fire.

132
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,787
I'll get water.

133
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,288
Stay right there!

134
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,794
-Call you later.
-Get rid of him!

135
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:38,462
Get rid of him!

136
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,766
-Use your head.
-I can handle it.

137
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,694
-Everything's all right?
-Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.

138
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,406
Then you're okay.

139
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,449
Thanks for keeping an eye out.

140
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,251
-Go now. We gave you all we've got.
-Okay, we're going.

141
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:18,878
Answer the phone.

142
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,172
Get them in the vault.

143
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,091
-Where's the money?
-Getting it! Got it.

144
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:32,683
He'll come with us.

145
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,061
Don't close it.
How can we breathe?

146
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,733
Wait a minute!

147
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,568
-Wait. Listen.
-What?

148
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,488
I will never make this.
I'll have to go to the toilet.

149
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,742
It's no joke.

150
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,037
I've got a terrible fear
of being locked in.

151
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,918
Who needs the bathroom?

152
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,169
I do too.

153
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,921
Now they all want to go.

154
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,256
Look, do you want to check it out?

155
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,301
It's the first door on your right.

156
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,181
All right, mouth, let's go.

157
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,519
First door on my right.

158
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,479
It's Maria!

159
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:21,899
I forgot she was in there.

160
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,151
She's always pulling this.

161
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,445
She should have 10 minutes, but--

162
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,240
Shut up!
Nobody goes to the bathroom!

163
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,368
-Let's go. Out!
-We're having a bank robbery.

164
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,288
Mulvaney speaking.

165
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:38,040
Mouth. Mouth!

166
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,125
-Here's your toilet.
-It's for you.

167
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:41,418
What?

168
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:42,670
Phone.

169
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:45,631
For you.

170
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,489
-What are you doing?
-Who is this?

171
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:15,786
Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti,
asshole! We got you by the balls.

172
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,330
I'm looking you right on the eye.

173
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:19,540
I can see you.

174
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:20,875
-Who is it?
-Cops.

175
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,440
Come to the front door....

176
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,192
Hang it up.

177
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,801
Come on, let's go.

178
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,346
How'd that happen?

179
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,558
Did I do anything to hurt you?
Did I treat you badly?

180
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,811
I'm on salary. I won't be a hero.

181
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,813
Did you have a plan or what?

182
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,065
What did you do,
barge in on a whim?

183
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,025
Why light a fire?

184
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,735
I told you to get out...

185
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,530
...when you could,
but you had to hang around.

186
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,616
He don't have a plan.
It's all a whim. Rob a bank!

187
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,076
I had it planned!

188
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:40,162
Only the money should have
been delivered, not taken away!

189
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:44,291
That fucking Jack, downtown,
he gave me the wrong information.

190
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:48,045
What is this Jack supposed to be?
A mastermind or what?

191
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,008
We're all in the barrel together
and we want to get out of it.

192
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,765
All right, I got to have time to think.
I got to think.

193
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:23,080
Keep away or we'll start throwing bodies
out the door, one at a time. Got that?

194
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,668
Who is this?

195
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:39,805
Is there a Jenny here?

196
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,349
Who's Jenny here?

197
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,851
That's me.

198
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,395
It's the squirrel.
You got a husband?

199
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,064
Well, he's on the phone.

200
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,399
Go ahead.

201
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,611
What could I tell him?

202
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,655
I don't know, whatever.
Tell him the truth.

203
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,992
What a fucking comedy!
W-N-E-W plays all the hits.

204
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,744
Listen. Don 't hang up.

205
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,830
-First, is anybody hurt in there?
-No.

206
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:09,043
Keep away or we'll start throwing bodies
out, one at a time. You got that?

207
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:12,880
Don't. Let me talk to you for a while.
How many people you got?

208
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,256
No, call me back.

209
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,674
Call me back.

210
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,012
He wants to know
when you'll be through.

211
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,766
What? Girlie, please!

212
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,984
Come on. Let's go.

213
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,410
-Where's the back door?
-It's locked on the inside.

214
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:44,954
Where is it?

215
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:47,331
Through the passageway to the right.

216
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:52,294
Cover them!

217
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,714
You could just go ahead
and look whatever's there.

218
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,040
Oh, yes, I will.
Yes, I will.

219
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,460
-Let's go, come on.
-Honey, I've got to go now.

220
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:35,713
I got to go.

221
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:38,466
I love you too.

222
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,594
All right, inside here.

223
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,641
I don't know what happened.

224
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:51,353
Maybe somebody tripped an alarm
or something. I don't know.

225
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:53,355
But there's a way out of this.

226
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,775
-Were you serious about what you said?
-About what?

227
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,576
About throwing
those bodies out the door?

228
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,082
-That's what I want him to think.
-I want to know what you think.

229
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,216
Because I'll tell you right now,
I'm ready to do it.

230
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,635
Right. Okay.

231
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,888
-I mean it.
-I know.

232
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,186
Listen, everybody.
I know we got a problem here.

233
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,189
But there's a way out of this thing.
I'm telling you.

234
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,025
All you got to do is cooperate with me.

235
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,653
Stay cool,
and we'll get out of this.

236
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,947
Nobody gets hurt if you listen to me.

237
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,326
First, we'll do things a step at a time.
You got to go to the bathroom, right?

238
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:48,953
She'll get to go to the bathroom.

239
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,541
Everybody who has to go is going.
We'll do things together, okay?

240
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,793
What's the matter with him?

241
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,588
He's got asthma.

242
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,465
Asthma?

243
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,690
I'll take care of that.

244
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,860
-You, what's your name?
-Mulvaney.

245
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,194
Come with me.

246
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:27,074
-He's got asthma and he's a guard?
-They go to guard school.

247
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,743
To learn how to shoot?
He doesn't have a gun.

248
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,038
They earn a $105 a week
to fold the flag in the morning...

249
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,791
...straighten up.
I don't know what they learn.

250
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:40,254
I want to block that door. In case
they try coming in, I can hear it.

251
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,755
Let's move this.

252
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:48,304
Wait a minute. Hold it!

253
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:51,849
Let's get rid of this.

254
00:23:57,688 --> 00:23:58,647
You got kids?

255
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:01,775
I got 2 kids and I'd like
to see them again.

256
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:04,653
You'll see them again.
You're being cooperative.

257
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:07,865
I got no complaints
against you, whatsoever.

258
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,493
Whatsoever.
You got bank insurance?

259
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,788
You know I do. You seem
to know a lot about bank procedure.

260
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,625
I know a lot of things.

261
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:24,590
I just want to get you
out of here safe, right?

262
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,010
What if I take you with me?

263
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,012
If you take anybody...

264
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,847
...please take me.

265
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,099
They'll shoot you, you know?

266
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,559
The cops...

267
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,688
...don't care about bank insurance.
See what they did in Attica?

268
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,984
42 people killed.
The innocent with the guilty.

269
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:54,245
I won't take you. I'll take one of
the girls, a married one with kids.

270
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:58,457
Cops don't like it in the papers when
they shoot a married woman with kids.

271
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:03,963
You're all right.

272
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,298
You won't fuck with me?

273
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,955
There's the FBI.

274
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,377
How you doing, Sheldon?

275
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,194
Why didn't you wait
and try to take them outside?

276
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,070
An error in judgment.

277
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:13,741
Thought the S.O.S would be remorseful
at the sight of a policeman.

278
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,618
And you know something?

279
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,661
Nobody said "hostage" yet, okay?

280
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,125
We got a bank robbery here.

281
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,464
How did the press guys
get through the barrier?

282
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:38,057
We don't know what's up yet.
We're setting up communications.

283
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:41,519
This is Ron Cummins from CBS.
Can you tell me the situation?

284
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:46,982
We're setting up communications.
Our perpetrators are in the bank.

285
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,651
That's all I can say now.

286
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,195
When I get it, you'll get it.
That's all.

287
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,032
What are you doing on the fire escape?

288
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,702
I said on the roof.
Get up on the roof, will you?

289
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:49,712
-Get the phone company?
-Setting it up now.

290
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:52,882
This phone is going to be
a direct line into the bank.

291
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:02,141
-Mulvaney speaking.
-Moretti here. Let me talk to him.

292
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:08,522
This is Detective Sergeant
Eugene Moretti.

293
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:12,610
You're there, we're here.
What do we do?

294
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:15,070
I don't know. What do we do?

295
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,448
Are the people in the bank okay?

296
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:19,033
They're okay.

297
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:22,870
-You alone or you got confederates?
-I'm not alone.

298
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:25,915
I got Sal.

299
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,083
What's that for, Salvatore?

300
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,127
He's a killer.

301
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,547
We're Vietnam veterans.
Killing don't mean anything to us.

302
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,466
-In the army?
-Yeah.

303
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,468
So you, what's your name?

304
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,179
Why do you want to know my name?

305
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:42,973
Just so I got something to call you.

306
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,777
Let's be reasonable, okay?
Just give me your name.

307
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,489
Call me Sonny.

308
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,825
Listen, Sonny.

309
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,952
I want to see
if the people are okay.

310
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:04,453
Right.

311
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,373
Then I want to work out a way
to get them out.

312
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,583
I want to come over without a gun.

313
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:13,045
Frisk me so you'll trust me.
We'll find a way out of this.

314
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:18,759
I just want to find some way
that I can trust you too.

315
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,512
Not be on the street
where you could shoot me.

316
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:24,140
-Some sign, right?
-Right. Like what?

317
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,183
Let the people out.

318
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,146
Who do you think you're dealing with?
A fucking idiot here?

319
00:29:30,396 --> 00:29:32,606
They're keeping me alive.
Let them out?

320
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:36,152
Talk to me. Just talk to me straight.
I'm ready to talk.

321
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:38,571
Give us the women?

322
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:41,240
No, I've got women.
That's all I've got.

323
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,826
Give me something.
Give me one of them.

324
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,370
-One?
-It's like a fair exchange.

325
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,583
I'll come over. I won't pack nothing,
don't know if you'll take me hostage.

326
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,084
It's a sign of trust.

327
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:55,504
-How do I call you back?
-It's a direct line.

328
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,715
Pick up the receiver and I'm here.

329
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,343
He wants one.

330
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,307
Him, right?

331
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:07,766
Right!

332
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,396
He goes.

333
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,153
What are we dealing with here?

334
00:30:21,197 --> 00:30:23,616
You have to keep
checking me out all the time?

335
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,367
Yeah.

336
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,208
He'll need the keys.

337
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,043
Got the keys?

338
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,546
Just the one, Sonny!

339
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:54,063
Don't fire!

340
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,190
What are you doing?

341
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,484
That's a hostage!

342
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,071
Don't fire!

343
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:03,447
Hold your fire!

344
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,616
We voted to send him out!

345
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:10,037
-He's one of the hostages!
-Get away from him!

346
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,956
He's a hostage!

347
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:15,584
What the hell's the matter with you?

348
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:19,380
I don't give a fuck!
Get out of here.

349
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:22,508
Hey, Sonny!
Wait a minute!

350
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,177
That was your fault, Sonny.

351
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,847
We had the communications set up here.

352
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,183
We're not set up properly,
with 250 cops here.

353
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:33,018
We don't know
what goes on in there.

354
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:36,397
-You almost killed him! Are you crazy?
-That was smart!

355
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:41,402
You say you got nothing but women,
and throw out a guy. What's going on?

356
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,529
You wanted a hostage,
I gave you one.

357
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,866
-Are you going to deal with us or not?
-I gave you one.

358
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:50,870
You did, but you should have
picked up the phone! Come on out.

359
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,873
I ain't packing nothing, see?

360
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:58,669
You can come out and frisk me.
You can tell.

361
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,257
-Why?
-To take a look at something.

362
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:07,344
-To see what you're up against.
-I can see. Why come out?

363
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,430
Come out and see it all.

364
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:18,147
Sal is in there with the other people.
Anything happens to me, they'll get it.

365
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,983
I don't forget about Sal.
Come out and look.

366
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,365
-I got to check with him first.
-You don't need that artillery.

367
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:38,334
5 minutes. You tell him that.

368
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,294
Take it easy.

369
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:43,172
Get them back.
He's got a white flag.

370
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:45,257
Everything's okay.

371
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:50,638
Come on out.

372
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:52,389
He's too close here.

373
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,142
Get back!
What the fuck are you doing?

374
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,563
Come on out.

375
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,315
Take a look at this.

376
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,360
Here, look! Look up here.

377
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:08,614
Over here.

378
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:17,039
Over there, right?
We got everything here, okay?

379
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,517
You got the militia here.

380
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,903
Let Sal come look.
What hope have you got?

381
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,198
Quit while you're ahead.

382
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,868
-It's only attempted robbery.
-Armed robbery.

383
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,495
All right, armed, then!
Nobody's been hurt.

384
00:33:56,787 --> 00:34:00,708
Release the hostages. No one
will worry over kidnapping charges.

385
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,961
At the most you'll get 5 years.
You'll get out in 1 .

386
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:06,297
-What?
-Kiss me.

387
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:09,467
When I'm being fucked,
I like to get kissed on the mouth.

388
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,595
You're a city cop, right?
Bank robbery's a federal offense.

389
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:16,390
They got me on kidnapping,
armed robbery. They'll bury me.

390
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,102
I won't talk to somebody trying
to con me. Get someone in charge.

391
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:24,106
I won't talk to some flunky pig
trying to con me. What's he doing?

392
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,150
-Get back!
-Why are they moving in?

393
00:34:26,442 --> 00:34:28,819
Will you get the fuck back there?

394
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:30,529
Get over there!

395
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,615
Go on back there, man!

396
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:35,284
He wants to kill me so bad!

397
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,953
-No one's going to kill anybody.
-Attica!

398
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:40,956
Attica!

399
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,304
Remember Attica!

400
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,562
Your word don't fucking matter!

401
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:05,523
Come on, calm down.

402
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,278
Put your guns down!

403
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,574
Without the TV guys,
they'd kill us all!

404
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:20,204
Put your guns down!

405
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,253
Put them down!

406
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,465
Put them down!

407
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:41,892
Attica!

408
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:55,239
You got it, man!

409
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,051
Robbing a bank?

410
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:22,683
Why didn't he tell me
he needed money?

411
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:27,354
He should have come to me
if he needed money.

412
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:34,528
We know that 8 people
are still being held on the bank.

413
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,866
The situation inside the bank
is totally unknown to us other than...

414
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:42,912
...descriptions that have been
obtained from Howard Calvin.

415
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:45,289
Why steal when your mom's a sucker?

416
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,460
We'll switch you now to Ron Cummons
at the bank on Brooklyn.

417
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:52,213
Miss Benson, what's it like inside?

418
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,673
They're holding up,
what can I say?

419
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,717
Got a deal?

420
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,386
The guy with the gun on us
is a quiet type.

421
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,722
Any confidence in Detective Moretti?

422
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,726
They don't know Detective Moretti yet.
I got to go now.

423
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:08,604
What's this with the hands?

424
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:10,481
She's out, let her stay.

425
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,734
They're my girls.
I'm going back in there.

426
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,331
-Howard. How is he?
-Howard's all right.

427
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,208
Put the TV on.

428
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,627
Girls, I was interviewed!

429
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,921
Looks good.

430
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,132
The media's there.

431
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:37,842
TV people.

432
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:39,343
TV people.

433
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,554
They want to talk to you.

434
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:52,523
Hello, Sonny.
You're on the air.

435
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,151
Would you answer
a few questions for us?

436
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,362
Why are you doing this?

437
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:03,784
Hello?

438
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:05,995
I just saw myself there.

439
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:07,872
Why am I doing it?

440
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:10,833
-Doing what?
-Robbing a bank.

441
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:18,132
I don't know what you mean by that.

442
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:21,093
I'm robbing a bank
because they got money here.

443
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:24,388
I mean, why do you feel
you have to steal for money?

444
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,056
Couldn't you get a job?

445
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:29,935
No. Doing what?

446
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:35,107
You know, if you want a job,
you got to be a member of a union.

447
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:38,277
If you got no union card,
you don't get a job.

448
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:40,321
What about non-union jobs?

449
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:45,034
What's wrong with him?

450
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:48,120
What do you mean non-union?
Like what, a bank teller?

451
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,998
You know how much
a bank teller makes? Not much.

452
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,000
$115 to start, right?

453
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,877
You can live on that?

454
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:59,381
I got a wife and kids. How am I to live
on that? What do you make a week?

455
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:03,052
-I'm here to talk to you, Sonny.
-Yeah, I'm talking to you.

456
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:06,680
We're entertainment, right?
What do you got for us?

457
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,933
What do you want to get for it?

458
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:13,187
-Do you expect to be paid?
-I don't need to be paid.

459
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:17,650
I'm here with my partner and 9 other
people. See, we're dying!

460
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:20,945
You're going to see
our brains on the sidewalk.

461
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,780
You'll show that on TV?

462
00:39:23,072 --> 00:39:26,242
Have housewives see that?
Instead of "As The World Turns"?

463
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,411
What do you got for me?
I want something for that.

464
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:32,331
-You could give up.
-Give up?

465
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:34,750
-You ever been in prison?
-No.

466
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,753
No! Let's talk about something
you fucking know about.

467
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,299
-How much you make a week?
-Transmission has been interrupted.

468
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,137
Please stand by, we will return
to our special news cast very soon.

469
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,639
Hello?
What the fuck happened?

470
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,269
Guess he disliked your language.

471
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,689
Fuck him!

472
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:27,178
I don't know,
they might deal with us.

473
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,640
I don't know about that guy out there.

474
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:36,479
But if I get the FBI involved in this,
they might deal.

475
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:38,230
What do you think?

476
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:51,535
What's wrong?

477
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:55,581
You made a promise, didn't you?
Did you promise me something?

478
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:59,376
Did you say either we get away clean
or we kill ourselves?

479
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:02,254
-Did you?
-I'm not talking about that.

480
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,508
Do you believe in keeping your promises?
Does it still go?

481
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:06,467
Yes.

482
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,093
What are you talking about?

483
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,058
I won't go back to prison.

484
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:21,982
Kill them all now.

485
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:25,236
-Take your bayonet, jam it into their--
-Fuck you!

486
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:06,068
We ask for a jet.
What do you think?

487
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:14,368
We get a helicopter.

488
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:18,122
We get a helicopter here,
it lands on the roof...

489
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:23,252
...and takes us to a jet.
And we fly the fuck out of the country.

490
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:29,884
We can do it.

491
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:38,893
We got them.
We don't even know it.

492
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:40,978
We've got the hostages.

493
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:45,774
We've been looking at this the
wrong way. We make the demands!

494
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:47,485
They'll give us what we want.

495
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:57,453
I'm flying to the tropics.
Fuck the snow!

496
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:05,169
Where's the mouth?

497
00:43:06,504 --> 00:43:10,841
-You ready to go to Algeria?
-Algeria? Yeah, sure!

498
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,469
We're all going to sunny climes!

499
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:16,222
I can make it happen!

500
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:18,557
I've made it happen so far.

501
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,351
I can make it happen.

502
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:29,735
Give me Moretti.

503
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,116
All of you, go ahead, make calls.
Call home or whatever.

504
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,118
We're going on a trip.

505
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,621
I want to talk to you.

506
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,958
-I'm coming out.
-Good, I'll be there.

507
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,960
Let's go, he's coming out.

508
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,548
You must understand something.

509
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:53,968
If we leave the country,
there's no coming back here.

510
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:56,554
There's no coming back.

511
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:59,056
If there's anyone you want to talk to...

512
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:02,351
...you want to say goodbye to,
do it now.

513
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,190
No.

514
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:13,487
Is there any special country
you want to go to?

515
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,783
Wyoming.

516
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:22,830
No, Wyoming....
That's not a country.

517
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,375
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.

518
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,734
Put them down!

519
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,907
Put them down! You hear that?
What do I have?

520
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,660
See this here, look!
I got nothing up my sleeve!

521
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:05,789
I got nothing here either!
Want to see my pockets? Here!

522
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,791
You need that gun, right!

523
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:13,589
Moretti! Tell them
to put their guns down!

524
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,467
Put it in your holster!

525
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:23,182
Put the guns down!

526
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,979
You know what it means
to put a gun down? What's this?

527
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,735
Right! Thank you very much!

528
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:38,739
You got it, right?

529
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:42,076
You got it, baby!
Hey, Moretti!

530
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,078
You made it happen!

531
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:51,544
You got Maria in there!

532
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,510
He's got a gun in there!

533
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,227
Get him the fuck out of here!

534
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,855
How the hell did that happen?

535
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:13,315
-I got Sal in there!
-Take it easy!

536
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:14,650
Notify the precinct.

537
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,485
Who the fuck is that?

538
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:19,029
One of them Spanish kids.

539
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,698
-Who's Maria?
-She's inside.

540
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,951
Sal wants to see Sonny,
says he'll shoot unless he does!

541
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,912
He's serious!
Sonny, he means it!

542
00:46:28,998 --> 00:46:30,291
It's all right.

543
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:37,465
-I'm sorry.
-How'd that happen?

544
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:40,092
You got his girlfriend in there.
You okay?

545
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,219
That fuck tried to kill me.

546
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,639
-You look all squeezed out.
-I am squeezed out!

547
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,434
Let me see your head, all right?

548
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:50,978
-I'm bleeding!
-Let me see it.

549
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,405
It's all right. You want to
talk to me about something?

550
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:04,074
Should've heard that phone call.

551
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:06,744
Some creep calls up
and says, "Kill everybody. "

552
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:08,579
Everyone wants to kill everyone.

553
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:13,042
I think you're going to get
assholes like that any how, right?

554
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,715
I want to talk to you.
I got an offer.

555
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,593
I want a helicopter.

556
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:27,389
And a jet to go wherever I want to go.

557
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,892
So I don't want a little jet,
I want a big one.

558
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:33,270
One with a bar, a piano.
Maybe I want to leave the country.

559
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:37,483
I don't know whether a helicopter
would fit in here or not.

560
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:38,984
I'll check it.

561
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:43,592
-It could land on the roof.
-That's asphalt, it'll break through.

562
00:47:43,842 --> 00:47:46,637
I'll call my superiors, you understand?

563
00:47:46,887 --> 00:47:48,972
Why not bring your superiors here?

564
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:52,017
Why am I talking to you
if you got to call superiors?

565
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:55,896
-We don't always see eye-to-eye.
-Yeah, so I'll talk to them.

566
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,481
I'll see what they say.

567
00:47:57,731 --> 00:48:00,818
I'll talk to them
and ask them, all right?

568
00:48:01,193 --> 00:48:02,861
Anything else I can get you?

569
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,284
I want you to bring
my wife down here.

570
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:12,162
-What do you give us?
-What do you want?

571
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:14,456
The women hostages.

572
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,502
There's no talking to you!

573
00:48:19,044 --> 00:48:21,714
I told you, that's all I got
in there is women.

574
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:24,675
You going to talk to me or what?

575
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,346
I give one hostage
for each thing you give me, see?

576
00:48:29,596 --> 00:48:33,642
The helicopter for a hostage.
The jet for a hostage.

577
00:48:33,892 --> 00:48:36,437
You give me my wife,
I give you a hostage.

578
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:38,897
Then the rest come home on the jet.

579
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:43,110
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

580
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:46,447
In the meantime,
pick out who you want to give us.

581
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:49,658
And tell me where
your wife is, all right?

582
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,121
I'm here minding my own business,
I hear the transistor go "Sonny what?"

583
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:56,290
I can 't believe my ears!
I grab the kids!

584
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,252
I'm telling you, Sonny didn't do it.
It ain't him to rob a bank!

585
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:04,006
It ain't him to steal or hurt anybody
or do nothing wrong!

586
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:06,967
He's never done wrong
since the day I know him!

587
00:49:07,217 --> 00:49:13,265
Night before last we're at Coney Island.
I see he keeps a loaded gun on the car!

588
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:16,101
Things are adding up
how crazy he's acting lately...

589
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:19,783
...and in with a bad crowd.
So I look at him.

590
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:22,744
Get in bed. He's yelling
at the kids like a madman.

591
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:26,247
Then he wants me to go in a
kiddie ride. I don't want to go.

592
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,748
He starts screaming at me.

593
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:32,251
He's screaming and screaming.

594
00:49:32,543 --> 00:49:35,296
I say, "What are you
going to do with the gun?"

595
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:37,422
Shoot me and dump me in the river?

596
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:41,008
I was scared of him.
I never been scared of him.

597
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:45,052
His mother says we always fought.
The cops was always at our house.

598
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:48,680
I hit him with a jack handle
once in the car.

599
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:51,183
I didn't even hit him.
I hit myself.

600
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:54,185
You should've seen the bruise
on my leg.

601
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:57,645
He'd put on his hat and coat,
he goes out the door.

602
00:49:59,856 --> 00:50:03,275
So they tell me he did it.
But I don't believe it.

603
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:06,861
Mrs. Wortzik, listen to me.
They want you down at the bank.

604
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:11,406
His body functions might've done it,
but he himself, he didn't do it!

605
00:50:19,162 --> 00:50:23,499
"Dear Abby: Lately I've been dreaming
about falling into water...

606
00:50:23,749 --> 00:50:26,751
...and not being able
to reach the surface.

607
00:50:27,293 --> 00:50:31,338
I begin to breathe heavily
and I wake up in a cold sweat.

608
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,258
A friend tells me that my problem
is one of sexual repression. "

609
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:39,135
Margaret, are you all right?

610
00:50:57,817 --> 00:51:01,277
Are you doing anything
to any of those girls on there?

611
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:03,320
He's back again.

612
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:10,034
Who's this?

613
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:14,287
Look at Margaret.

614
00:51:17,415 --> 00:51:19,124
What's the matter with her?

615
00:51:19,874 --> 00:51:21,876
There's no air in here.

616
00:51:25,879 --> 00:51:28,548
What happened to the air conditioning?

617
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,512
I'm sorry, Syl.

618
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:40,140
Where's the air conditioning?

619
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,850
In the basement.

620
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,605
I'll go check the air conditioning.

621
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:51,357
I'll be right back.

622
00:52:00,573 --> 00:52:03,408
I never been up in an airplane before.

623
00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:08,995
So?

624
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:13,498
I mean, it's safe.
It's like a car.

625
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:15,500
It's safer than a car.

626
00:52:18,252 --> 00:52:20,004
It's all right, Sal.

627
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:27,885
I'm going to go check it now.

628
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:55,363
They're coming in the back!

629
00:52:55,614 --> 00:52:56,865
In the vault!

630
00:52:59,784 --> 00:53:01,994
-Get back!
-No, don't fire!

631
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,834
That's it, Sonny!

632
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,335
Get her in there!

633
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:17,923
Who fired that shot?

634
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:21,217
Pick her up and put her in.

635
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:24,386
Who fired?

636
00:53:26,513 --> 00:53:28,013
Come on! Move!

637
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,348
Okay, legs!

638
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:40,523
Get the bullhorn!

639
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,032
You got that bullhorn?

640
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:02,498
Come on out, Sonny!

641
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:07,752
That's all I need.

642
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:14,632
Take care of that, will you?

643
00:54:16,592 --> 00:54:17,926
Come on out!

644
00:54:18,468 --> 00:54:20,721
Straighten that out, will you?

645
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:23,597
Sonny, come on out.

646
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:37,692
You son of a bitch,
you want to get those people killed?

647
00:54:49,284 --> 00:54:50,744
Come on out here, now.

648
00:55:09,382 --> 00:55:11,217
I see you, Sonny, come on!

649
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,190
What's the matter with you?

650
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:33,567
-What?
-Why'd you fire that shot in there?

651
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:35,361
We got 250 cops here!

652
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:37,820
Fuck you! What were
they doing back there?

653
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,365
What the hell's the matter with you?

654
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:42,532
Are we dealing?

655
00:55:42,783 --> 00:55:44,785
-They were trying to get in there?
-Who?

656
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:46,369
Come on, you know who!

657
00:55:47,661 --> 00:55:49,788
-What's going on?
-You're full of shit!

658
00:55:50,038 --> 00:55:51,873
Find out what's going on there!

659
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:54,792
-Honest to God, Sonny, I don't know!
-Bullshit!

660
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,960
Communications aren't set up yet.

661
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:59,462
Get someone to talk to me!

662
00:55:59,754 --> 00:56:01,630
I'm not talking to you anymore.

663
00:56:01,922 --> 00:56:04,299
-Let me talk to you.
-You say this, you do that.

664
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:05,883
Why were they back there?

665
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:07,051
I don't know!

666
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:08,427
You're full of shit!

667
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:10,512
-It's another force.
-A tactical force!

668
00:56:10,762 --> 00:56:13,348
They like to shoot,
climb through windows!

669
00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:16,517
They like that, right!
Without your orders, right?

670
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:18,226
Yes! Without my orders!

671
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,894
You coming through the roof?

672
00:56:20,228 --> 00:56:21,229
I tell you we won't.

673
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:24,898
You're telling me a lot of things,
but you're not doing them.

674
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,440
What were they doing?!

675
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:29,610
-I don't know!
-And you can't answer me.

676
00:56:30,777 --> 00:56:32,320
-You can't answer.
-Yes, I can.

677
00:56:32,612 --> 00:56:34,656
So tell me what they were doing.

678
00:56:34,947 --> 00:56:37,408
No communications!
I sent someone back there.

679
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:42,537
I got a guy in there who's going to kill
somebody. That's your responsibility.

680
00:56:42,787 --> 00:56:45,831
Wait a minute, hold on.
We got everything you wanted.

681
00:56:47,415 --> 00:56:49,792
Can't get a helicopter,
but a bus is coming.

682
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,752
We got a jet coming
into Kennedy, all right?

683
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:59,299
We got ahold of your wife.

684
00:57:00,091 --> 00:57:01,467
Your wife is coming.

685
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,927
We reached her
and she's coming here.

686
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,888
Where are you going?

687
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,682
I'm right here.
I thought we were going to talk.

688
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:12,142
I thought so, too.
But we're not.

689
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:14,144
We're trying
to get in the back door.

690
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:15,687
Your wife will be here soon.

691
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,065
They're still pointing.
They love it.

692
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:22,692
Holster that weapon!
Holster it!

693
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:24,693
Holster that weapon!

694
00:57:25,444 --> 00:57:26,695
You too!

695
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,156
All right, come on.

696
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,658
-What?
-What else do you want me to do?

697
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,951
How could you do any better?

698
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,786
We got all you wanted.

699
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,413
I'll do anything I can
to stop anything.

700
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:43,333
Anything else?

701
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,168
-Yeah.
-What?

702
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:48,128
I got some people
in there that are hungry.

703
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:50,671
-Can you get food?
-What do you want?

704
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:53,591
-Want some pizzas?
-Yeah, all right.

705
00:57:56,426 --> 00:57:57,635
Get some pizzas in.

706
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:00,220
Can we get some beer, you think?

707
00:58:00,471 --> 00:58:03,139
No beer.
Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right?

708
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,769
Some soft drinks too, okay?
Cokes!

709
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,895
-What else?
-And some aspirin too.

710
00:58:11,145 --> 00:58:12,647
Some lady's not feeling well.

711
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,522
Anything else?

712
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:16,900
Don't con me.

713
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:19,526
I'm not!
Why would I want to do that?

714
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:23,613
I'm in trouble enough as it is.
I'm not trying to create any trouble.

715
00:58:33,037 --> 00:58:34,288
It's okay.

716
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:41,210
They can't bring a helicopter in here.

717
00:58:41,877 --> 00:58:43,461
They can't land it here.

718
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:47,048
They're going to get us a big bus
so we can all get in.

719
00:58:47,298 --> 00:58:49,257
And that's how we get to the airport.

720
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:52,134
It looks good.

721
00:58:55,638 --> 00:58:58,056
You people,
I just ordered you some food.

722
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:01,308
I even got her some aspirins.

723
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:03,519
So we're moving it along now.

724
00:59:03,894 --> 00:59:07,188
I got to pay for the food.
Where's the marked fives?

725
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,107
That was a foolish thing
you did back there.

726
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:13,734
Foolish thing.

727
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:19,239
We going to get the ball rolling?

728
00:59:19,864 --> 00:59:22,032
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

729
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:24,368
I'm working on it.
What's it look like?

730
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,995
You think it's easy?
I got to keep them cool.

731
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:28,997
I got to keep you people happy.

732
00:59:29,246 --> 00:59:31,456
I got to have the ideas
and do it all alone.

733
00:59:31,707 --> 00:59:33,416
You want to try it?

734
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,294
Your food is here, Sonny.

735
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:39,838
You're starting to get on my nerves.

736
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:52,723
Go on with him there.
You'll be all right. Go right ahead.

737
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:58,268
-What do I owe you?
-It's all paid for.

738
00:59:58,601 --> 01:00:01,646
-No, I've paid for that.
-I got it.

739
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:03,230
Here.

740
01:00:03,564 --> 01:00:04,815
Keep the change.

741
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:13,488
You want this?

742
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:18,367
You like it?

743
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,668
Moretti, could you use five?

744
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:41,176
I got a lot for you.

745
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:53,602
Get back, god damn it!

746
01:01:11,783 --> 01:01:14,368
More! More! More!

747
01:01:24,084 --> 01:01:26,210
Could you open it?

748
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:28,921
Thank you, man.

749
01:01:33,633 --> 01:01:35,884
I'm a fucking star!

750
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:07,241
No, just pick her up and hold her.
She'll be okay.

751
01:02:09,285 --> 01:02:11,077
You kick good.
Here.

752
01:02:23,462 --> 01:02:25,255
This is where it gets stuck!

753
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:33,177
Miriam's making a fool of herself.

754
01:02:34,721 --> 01:02:37,931
Anybody got a cigarette?
Yeah, I do.

755
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:39,683
Sylvia, you don't smoke!

756
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:42,643
You don't?

757
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,315
Why do you want to start now?

758
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:52,484
-I'm scared to death, that's why.
-You don't smoke?

759
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:55,486
No.
How come?

760
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:02,867
-I don't want the cancer.
-My God!

761
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:04,201
The cigarette.

762
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:06,578
Do what you want.

763
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:10,581
I think you ought to
take care of your body.

764
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:12,625
My body? What for?

765
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,420
Your body is the temple of the Lord.

766
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,381
You're serious!

767
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,135
So you rob a bank...

768
01:03:27,385 --> 01:03:29,804
...but you keep your body pure.
Is that it?

769
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,644
You going to smoke or what?

770
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,271
Yes.

771
01:03:41,563 --> 01:03:44,148
If I die of cancer,
it'll be half your fault.

772
01:03:49,486 --> 01:03:51,528
No, it's because you're weak.

773
01:03:51,946 --> 01:03:53,697
Right, I'm weak.

774
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:57,158
Where's your bullets?

775
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:58,952
Mulvaney speaking.

776
01:04:01,787 --> 01:04:03,287
It's Moretti.

777
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:11,336
Will you guys hold it down back there?

778
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:13,337
They're bringing in your wife.

779
01:04:30,183 --> 01:04:32,560
-Where's Moretti?
-Probably in the bar.

780
01:04:41,066 --> 01:04:42,609
In the barber shop.

781
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:46,612
What's that?

782
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:49,948
We went to Bellevue
where you told us...

783
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:51,616
...said he was his wife.

784
01:04:51,908 --> 01:04:53,617
They were married in a church.

785
01:04:53,867 --> 01:04:55,327
Jesus Christ!

786
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:04,585
Leon, over here!

787
01:05:11,923 --> 01:05:13,174
Happy birthday!

788
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,350
-Give us some room.
-Watch his head!

789
01:05:30,104 --> 01:05:31,646
He's a queer?

790
01:05:32,647 --> 01:05:34,899
Sarge, he wants you!

791
01:05:36,942 --> 01:05:39,485
Get the shield out of here.
I don't need it now.

792
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:41,030
Where were you 4 hours ago,
when I needed it?

793
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,698
He's not going to shoot.
Yeah, Sonny, what?

794
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,158
What happened?
Is he all right?

795
01:05:47,408 --> 01:05:48,576
He's a little groggy.

796
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:50,786
No, let me talk to him.

797
01:05:50,995 --> 01:05:53,205
I'll get him on his feet and call back.

798
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:54,206
Shut the door!

799
01:05:57,208 --> 01:06:00,126
Stop the noise.
I don't want to hear a fucking sound!

800
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,461
Typewriter!

801
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:04,338
Get off the fucking phone.

802
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:05,964
Now!

803
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:08,216
Give me some water.

804
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:18,641
You all right? They give you a shot
down at the hospital or something?

805
01:06:20,892 --> 01:06:22,769
They shot me with, like, unreal!

806
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:24,853
You got to get ahold of yourself...

807
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,106
...so you can talk to him,
and see if he'll come out.

808
01:06:30,149 --> 01:06:32,776
He's got 8 people there,
with a Sal. You know him?

809
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:36,488
-No, not really.
-He says he's going to shoot them.

810
01:06:36,696 --> 01:06:40,282
I can't help it.
I can't stop him from anything.

811
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,200
Who will he listen to, then?

812
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:45,285
I can't talk to him.
He won't listen to anybody.

813
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:48,205
He's been crazy all summer.

814
01:06:49,497 --> 01:06:51,332
He's tried to kill me since June.

815
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:56,169
He put a gun to my head.
And he cut me with a knife.

816
01:06:56,378 --> 01:06:59,380
-He beat up my friends.
-Did you contact the police?

817
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:02,173
What good would that do?

818
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:06,343
It'd just make him mad. They don't
know him. It wouldn't stop him.

819
01:07:06,635 --> 01:07:11,013
-Somebody's got to stop him.
-You don't understand. He's crazy.

820
01:07:15,058 --> 01:07:16,601
He's got a wife, children.

821
01:07:17,936 --> 01:07:19,478
He's a wonderful father.

822
01:07:20,813 --> 01:07:21,772
His mother...

823
01:07:22,064 --> 01:07:26,317
...you should see her. Together with
his father, they're like a car wreck.

824
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:29,695
It just rolls off his back.

825
01:07:29,987 --> 01:07:33,030
He sees them.
He pays the rent. Unbelievable!

826
01:07:34,866 --> 01:07:38,994
I was the one that wanted to get
married. He didn't really want it...

827
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:41,954
...but he did it.
I don't know why.

828
01:07:42,872 --> 01:07:44,497
Why did you want to get married?

829
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,711
I thought it would help me.

830
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:54,505
But it didn't.

831
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:58,258
I was so confused.
I was doing...

832
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,967
...insane things.

833
01:08:01,051 --> 01:08:02,636
What sort of things, Leon?

834
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,016
After the wedding...

835
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:12,768
...I ran off for 10 days
to Atlantic City.

836
01:08:13,686 --> 01:08:15,605
Sonny was frantic.

837
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:20,233
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't
know where I was, who I was with.

838
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,486
I couldn't explain the things I did.

839
01:08:24,737 --> 01:08:27,071
So I went to a psychiatrist...

840
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:28,907
...who told me...

841
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:33,576
...that I was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

842
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:45,002
So right away he wanted to give me
money for the sex change operation.

843
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,212
But where was he going to get it?

844
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:49,047
$2,500?

845
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,925
My God, he was in hock
up to his ears already.

846
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:55,009
He needed the money
for your operation?

847
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:57,220
It drove him crazy.

848
01:08:58,428 --> 01:09:00,931
He would fly into these rages.

849
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:04,016
And I got more depressed than ever.

850
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:06,351
I knew I'd never get my operation.

851
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,482
So I tried to kill myself.
I took about a half a pound of pills.

852
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,818
Blues, yellows, screamers,
uppers, downers, you name it.

853
01:09:18,736 --> 01:09:20,570
And I wound up in the hospital.

854
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:24,907
And Sonny comes there...

855
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:27,283
...and he just looks at me.

856
01:09:28,576 --> 01:09:30,245
And he says...

857
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,454
..."Why, Leon?

858
01:09:32,788 --> 01:09:35,414
When things were going so good?"

859
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:41,503
Don't you think...

860
01:09:44,296 --> 01:09:45,756
...he did it for you?

861
01:09:49,342 --> 01:09:51,344
Yeah, I guess so.

862
01:09:52,928 --> 01:09:56,014
Don't you think you owe it to him
to try to get him out?

863
01:09:57,431 --> 01:09:59,559
I can't talk to him.

864
01:10:01,643 --> 01:10:04,895
You're up to your neck in it.
You're an accessory.

865
01:10:05,354 --> 01:10:10,233
-They can't hold me responsible.
-Wait, you could help us a little.

866
01:10:10,608 --> 01:10:11,526
I'm afraid.

867
01:10:11,776 --> 01:10:15,320
Just talk to him for a minute.
How can he hurt you on the phone?

868
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:20,741
I can't.
I don't know what to....

869
01:10:20,992 --> 01:10:22,909
Just talk with him on the phone.

870
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:31,916
You think about it.

871
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:40,423
He won't talk to you.

872
01:10:40,965 --> 01:10:42,924
What do you mean he won't talk to me?

873
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:44,843
I'll work on it.

874
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:46,802
I thought you were doing that.

875
01:10:55,434 --> 01:10:56,727
He won't talk to me.

876
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:15,991
They are questioning Leon Schermer,
a 26-year-old admitted homosexual...

877
01:11:16,283 --> 01:11:19,911
...who claims to have married
one of the bank robbers last November.

878
01:11:21,162 --> 01:11:24,623
According to sources on the barber shop
where Leon is held...

879
01:11:24,873 --> 01:11:26,416
...Leon has reportedly said...

880
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:30,002
...they were married in an
official ceremony by a Father Burke.

881
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,339
Leon 's story has been confirmed.

882
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:38,967
7 bridesmaids, all male,
Sonny's mother and 70 other guests...

883
01:11:39,176 --> 01:11:41,594
...all members of the gay community.

884
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:47,891
We've been able to obtain
a still photograph of Leon on his gown.

885
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,810
Leon has confirmed...

886
01:11:51,101 --> 01:11:54,562
...that the gowns for himself
and his bridesmaids cost $700.

887
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,483
We have not confirmed the story...

888
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:03,986
...with the priest. But we are told
that he was subsequently defrocked.

889
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:09,615
Phone calls have arrived from
various factions of the gay community.

890
01:12:09,865 --> 01:12:13,535
Some on support of Sonny
and his actions, others condemning...

891
01:12:14,202 --> 01:12:16,704
...the present events
and calling the marriage...

892
01:12:16,955 --> 01:12:21,499
...a farce, and, quote, "A case
of sheer exhibitionism. " End quote.

893
01:12:23,459 --> 01:12:26,837
Coverage of the robbery where
2 homosexuals hold hostages...

894
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:29,964
...for their demands of
a helicopter, a jet....

895
01:12:30,965 --> 01:12:34,259
They said, "2 homosexuals in the bank. "
Right on TV! You hear?

896
01:12:34,425 --> 01:12:37,637
What difference does it make?
They can say anything they want.

897
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:39,263
Let them say it.

898
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,977
I'm not homosexual.

899
01:12:48,687 --> 01:12:51,897
Tell them to get that right.
That's going out on the TV.

900
01:12:57,193 --> 01:13:01,738
What am I supposed to do? I can't
control what they say on television.

901
01:13:03,406 --> 01:13:06,784
What should I do? I'm doing
everything I can, I can't do that.

902
01:13:13,497 --> 01:13:17,584
Forget about it. It's just a freak show
to them, anyway. It don't matter.

903
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:19,626
Whatever they say don't matter.

904
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:27,175
It'll be all right.

905
01:13:36,431 --> 01:13:37,932
What's the matter with you?

906
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:42,644
You shouldn't let something like that
spoil your fun.

907
01:13:43,061 --> 01:13:44,979
You have to get fun out of life.

908
01:13:52,152 --> 01:13:54,028
Where's the god damn jet?

909
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:57,864
They're always screaming overhead,
going somewhere...

910
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,241
...when you don't need them, you know?

911
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:28,262
What are you going to tell
the pilot when you get on the plane?

912
01:14:29,514 --> 01:14:31,348
You have to know, right?

913
01:14:32,182 --> 01:14:33,683
Holland's pretty good.

914
01:14:33,934 --> 01:14:37,478
-Holland?
-They sheltered people during the war.

915
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,813
They're good people.

916
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,523
Where's Holland?

917
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:43,440
It's right up....

918
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:44,942
It's over there!

919
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,283
Get in the vault. Come on!

920
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:57,576
Quickly!

921
01:15:09,961 --> 01:15:12,546
They're waiting for us
to do something, I think.

922
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:20,677
Come on out for a second.

923
01:15:20,969 --> 01:15:21,928
It's him.

924
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,680
Come on out.
I want to talk to you a second.

925
01:15:27,433 --> 01:15:28,850
Come on!

926
01:15:39,608 --> 01:15:41,192
Come on out, Sonny.

927
01:15:48,532 --> 01:15:50,074
Come on out a minute.

928
01:15:51,534 --> 01:15:52,660
That's it.

929
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,468
What the fuck is going on?
Get the lights back on.

930
01:16:17,179 --> 01:16:18,138
Who are you?

931
01:16:19,722 --> 01:16:21,515
FBI, Sheldon.

932
01:16:24,184 --> 01:16:25,643
Good.

933
01:16:25,894 --> 01:16:28,479
About time. Maybe we can
get this thing started?

934
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:31,189
Look, get the lights back on...

935
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:34,484
...and the air conditioner.
We got no air conditioning.

936
01:16:34,692 --> 01:16:36,985
No more favors.
That's all over.

937
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:38,278
Favors?

938
01:16:38,612 --> 01:16:40,905
You been doing me favors all night?

939
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:44,240
I have a jet, limo will be here
in a half hour.

940
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,285
I want the hostages.

941
01:16:50,496 --> 01:16:51,954
No, no. Bullshit!

942
01:16:52,789 --> 01:16:55,249
I'd like to work with you on this,
not against you.

943
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,709
The hostages are
what's keeping me alive.

944
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,170
When do I get them?

945
01:17:02,963 --> 01:17:04,506
Didn't they tell you?

946
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:08,342
I'd like to hear it from you.

947
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,597
You get one hostage for the
limousine that you bring me in.

948
01:17:15,348 --> 01:17:18,225
One hostage for the jet.

949
01:17:18,809 --> 01:17:22,103
Then I get to the airport.
I go into the plane, check it out.

950
01:17:22,395 --> 01:17:24,896
And if it's okay,
they all come out.

951
01:17:27,107 --> 01:17:29,358
-I want to go inside.
-Why?

952
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:31,318
See if everybody's all right.

953
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:32,944
They're all right.

954
01:17:33,486 --> 01:17:34,821
No, I have to see.

955
01:17:43,953 --> 01:17:45,412
You got guts.

956
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:48,915
Think if we slit their throats,
we're going to let you out?

957
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:50,916
I have to see.

958
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:04,510
I got to check with my partner.

959
01:18:11,974 --> 01:18:14,475
The FBI, Sal.
They're coming in.

960
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:31,031
You'd like to kill me?

961
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,448
Bet you would.

962
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,074
I wouldn't like to kill you.

963
01:18:34,324 --> 01:18:35,950
I will if I have to.

964
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,952
It's your job, right?

965
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:40,912
The guy who kills me...

966
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:45,332
...I hope he does it because he hates
my guts, not because it's his job.

967
01:18:52,004 --> 01:18:55,090
Nobody give your right name.
It's the FBI.

968
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:10,393
Just want to make sure all you
young ladies are all right in here.

969
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:15,022
They asked for the jet hours ago.
What are you doing?

970
01:19:15,272 --> 01:19:18,441
That's being set up. We'll
have you out in a few hours.

971
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:21,860
-A few hours?
-Why don't you give them what they want?

972
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:24,988
They'll get it. We want
to be sure we get what we want.

973
01:19:25,237 --> 01:19:28,074
Let's get you all out of here safe.

974
01:19:29,783 --> 01:19:31,076
You two boys too.

975
01:19:31,409 --> 01:19:32,744
That's close enough.

976
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:39,749
Tell the TV to stop saying
there's 2 homosexuals in here.

977
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:42,084
I will.

978
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:46,629
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

979
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:13,608
You handled yourself well.

980
01:20:14,067 --> 01:20:18,112
A lot of men would have choked. We
might have had a death on our hands.

981
01:20:18,362 --> 01:20:20,822
But you handled it.
I respect that.

982
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:24,574
Don't you try to take Sal.
We'll handle him.

983
01:20:25,575 --> 01:20:27,493
Sit tight and you won't get hurt.

984
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,453
What are you talking about?

985
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:32,831
You just sit quiet.

986
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:35,583
We'll handle Sal.

987
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:42,213
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?

988
01:20:59,226 --> 01:21:00,560
What'd he say?

989
01:21:03,104 --> 01:21:05,230
He was just talking about arrangements.

990
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:08,317
I talked to him about the TV.
It will be all right.

991
01:21:09,191 --> 01:21:10,192
That's all?

992
01:21:13,737 --> 01:21:15,280
Why couldn't he say it here?

993
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:21,868
I don't know. He wanted to show me
how the bus is going to come in.

994
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:33,793
What's the matter?

995
01:21:35,879 --> 01:21:37,130
Someone get a glass of water.

996
01:21:39,423 --> 01:21:40,424
Got a hankie?

997
01:21:42,383 --> 01:21:43,509
They poisoned the pizza.

998
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,261
It's not the pizza!

999
01:21:45,511 --> 01:21:47,179
He's got diabetes.

1000
01:21:48,347 --> 01:21:52,016
He had some Coke before.
Don't give him anything. I'll hold it.

1001
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:55,810
What can we do for you,
Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us.

1002
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:02,775
Is there a doctor out here?

1003
01:22:05,902 --> 01:22:07,986
We need a doctor in here.

1004
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:12,406
We need a doctor.

1005
01:22:14,533 --> 01:22:15,242
What?

1006
01:22:15,492 --> 01:22:18,536
The manager, he's diabetic.
He don't look good.

1007
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,756
I got to search you.

1008
01:22:52,312 --> 01:22:53,479
Just him.

1009
01:22:57,774 --> 01:23:01,568
I've convinced Leon to talk to you.
He's on the phone now.

1010
01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:16,664
He's coming on.

1011
01:23:29,424 --> 01:23:30,841
Hello, Leon?

1012
01:23:32,217 --> 01:23:33,802
Hello, Sonny.

1013
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,678
What happened?

1014
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:38,055
How are you doing?

1015
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:41,141
Well, I'm out of the hospital.

1016
01:23:41,641 --> 01:23:45,144
Yeah, I know.
I thought you'd never get out.

1017
01:23:46,228 --> 01:23:49,314
I never thought I'd get out this way,
I'll tell you.

1018
01:23:51,523 --> 01:23:53,191
How are you doing?

1019
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:57,069
I'm a little shaky.

1020
01:23:57,653 --> 01:24:01,072
Moretti told me that you were all
drugged up...

1021
01:24:02,073 --> 01:24:06,619
...so I figured that's why you didn't
want to talk. I was wondering why.

1022
01:24:06,869 --> 01:24:08,620
It was really terrible, you know?

1023
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:12,164
You walk in, and right away
they say you're crazy.

1024
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,875
Then they start sticking
things in your arm.

1025
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:19,878
How do they expect you to get uncrazy
if you're asleep all the time?

1026
01:24:21,421 --> 01:24:23,923
I'm just starting to come out of it now.

1027
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:29,010
So, how are you?

1028
01:24:29,302 --> 01:24:30,678
I'm fine.

1029
01:24:32,846 --> 01:24:34,556
This is something, huh?

1030
01:24:41,269 --> 01:24:44,397
I don't know.
I'm dying here.

1031
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,569
You ever listen to yourself
when you say, "You're dying"?

1032
01:24:51,861 --> 01:24:54,988
-You ever listen to yourself?
-What are you talking about?

1033
01:24:55,238 --> 01:24:58,699
What do you mean, what am I
talking about? "You're dying. "

1034
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:01,493
Do you know that
you say that to me every day?

1035
01:25:03,036 --> 01:25:05,955
You're not dying.
You're killing the people around you.

1036
01:25:06,246 --> 01:25:09,667
Leon, don't give me that shit.
I don't need that deep shit now!

1037
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:12,418
You don't realize what
the things you do mean.

1038
01:25:12,669 --> 01:25:13,544
Yeah?

1039
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:15,128
I know what I do.

1040
01:25:15,629 --> 01:25:17,339
You stock a gun
to somebody's head.

1041
01:25:17,589 --> 01:25:20,216
I don't know
what I'm doing sometimes.

1042
01:25:20,508 --> 01:25:21,259
Obviously, you don't.

1043
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:23,843
"Go to sleep
so it won't hurt when I shoot. "

1044
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:27,346
What do you think
I've been doing on the hospital?

1045
01:25:27,596 --> 01:25:30,224
I take a handful of pills
to get away from you.

1046
01:25:32,225 --> 01:25:34,768
Now I'm talking to you
on the phone again.

1047
01:25:35,018 --> 01:25:37,729
I've got no job.
I don't have friends.

1048
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,606
I can't live.
I have to live with people.

1049
01:25:42,483 --> 01:25:44,359
This death business, I'm sorry.

1050
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:47,778
I don't know what I'm getting here
with that shit.

1051
01:25:48,028 --> 01:25:52,156
What am I supposed to say to that?
This is going on.

1052
01:25:52,407 --> 01:25:54,826
-You're giving me that shit.
-I'm sorry.

1053
01:25:55,076 --> 01:25:56,743
You know what's happening.

1054
01:25:56,994 --> 01:25:59,620
You know the pressures
I've been having, right?

1055
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:03,165
I got these pressures. You know it.
You're in that hospital...

1056
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:06,626
...with them tubes coming out
and want that operation, right?

1057
01:26:06,835 --> 01:26:09,378
You're giving me that shit.
Everybody's giving me shit.

1058
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:14,340
Everybody needs money.
So you needed money? I got you money.

1059
01:26:14,632 --> 01:26:16,092
I didn't ask you to rob a bank!

1060
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:18,260
I know you didn't ask me.

1061
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,680
I'm not putting this
on anybody, you know?

1062
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:25,932
Nothing on nobody!
I did this on my own. You see?

1063
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:29,184
All on my own, I did it.
But I want you to know something.

1064
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:32,688
I want you to know
that I'm getting out of here.

1065
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,189
I'm getting a plane out of here...

1066
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,151
...and I just wanted you to know it.
And I wanted you to come down...

1067
01:26:39,401 --> 01:26:42,361
...and I wanted to just say
goodbye to you.

1068
01:26:42,612 --> 01:26:45,906
Or, if you wanted to,
you could come with me.

1069
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:48,825
You're free to do what you want.
That's what...

1070
01:26:49,117 --> 01:26:50,910
...I wanted to say to you.

1071
01:26:53,203 --> 01:26:55,496
-I'm free to do what I want?
-Right.

1072
01:26:55,747 --> 01:27:00,584
I try to get away from you for months
and I'm going with you on a trip?

1073
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:02,835
Where are you going?

1074
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:07,130
I don't know where yet.
We said Algeria. I don't know.

1075
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:09,466
So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know yet.

1076
01:27:09,716 --> 01:27:12,217
Why are you going to Algeria?

1077
01:27:13,886 --> 01:27:16,888
I don't know why.
They got a Howard Johnson's there.

1078
01:27:17,096 --> 01:27:19,932
You're warped, you know that?
You're really warped.

1079
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:22,559
I'm warped.
I know I'm warped.

1080
01:27:22,892 --> 01:27:24,352
Algeria!

1081
01:27:28,021 --> 01:27:31,315
You know they walk around
with masks on, things on their heads.

1082
01:27:31,565 --> 01:27:34,735
-They're a bunch of crazy people.
-What am I supposed to do?

1083
01:27:35,027 --> 01:27:38,154
-You could have picked a better place.
-Like where?

1084
01:27:38,404 --> 01:27:40,530
Sweden? Denmark?

1085
01:27:42,616 --> 01:27:44,742
Yeah, like that.

1086
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:49,829
You know what?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1087
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,124
I had to tell him it's not a country.
He don't know where Wyoming is.

1088
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,127
I'm with a guy who don't know where
Wyoming is. Think you got problems?

1089
01:28:01,588 --> 01:28:03,298
So, Sal is with you?

1090
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:04,715
Oh, boy!

1091
01:28:04,966 --> 01:28:07,009
You'd be better off giving up.

1092
01:28:08,094 --> 01:28:11,388
I'm not giving up, because
why have I done this so far?

1093
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:15,432
I've gone so far with this,
and why should I give up now?

1094
01:28:16,016 --> 01:28:17,559
I can't give up.

1095
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:24,189
-Would you do me a favor?
-Yeah, what?

1096
01:28:26,482 --> 01:28:29,234
These guys that have me down here...

1097
01:28:31,444 --> 01:28:34,446
...they think I'm part of the plot
to rob the bank.

1098
01:28:34,947 --> 01:28:38,575
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy.
They're bullshitting you.

1099
01:28:38,825 --> 01:28:40,618
They're giving you a snow job.

1100
01:28:40,869 --> 01:28:43,495
They told me I was an accessory.

1101
01:28:43,745 --> 01:28:46,539
That's just a con job on you.
Don't listen to that.

1102
01:28:46,747 --> 01:28:50,500
I have to listen to it.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny.

1103
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:53,670
-You're not going to prison.
-How do you know?

1104
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,629
Because I know.
Believe me.

1105
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,298
Look, please, just tell them.

1106
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:00,008
Tell them what?

1107
01:29:00,258 --> 01:29:02,093
That you didn't do it?

1108
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:04,386
Are they on the phone now?

1109
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:06,721
Yeah.

1110
01:29:07,013 --> 01:29:09,599
That's great, Leon.
That's really terrific.

1111
01:29:09,932 --> 01:29:12,434
You talk with them on the phone.
Really smart!

1112
01:29:12,684 --> 01:29:14,561
-I have no choice!
-What do you mean?

1113
01:29:14,852 --> 01:29:18,731
What am I supposed to do? There are
7,000 fucking cops all around me.

1114
01:29:19,022 --> 01:29:20,982
-Who's on now?
-Don't lay it on me!

1115
01:29:21,232 --> 01:29:24,234
I'm not, but you knew
that was going on, right?

1116
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,445
You knew what was happening, right?

1117
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:27,945
Yeah!

1118
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:30,489
I want to know
who's on the phone now.

1119
01:29:33,658 --> 01:29:34,910
Moretti, is that you?

1120
01:29:39,704 --> 01:29:42,999
Will somebody talk to me?
Somebody going to talk to me or what?

1121
01:29:43,249 --> 01:29:44,249
They on now?

1122
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:46,460
They won't talk to you.

1123
01:29:47,461 --> 01:29:51,047
He didn't do it, okay?
He had nothing to do with it.

1124
01:29:53,465 --> 01:29:55,050
Will you get off the phone?

1125
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,051
Are they off?

1126
01:30:01,638 --> 01:30:06,391
That really convinced them. They
wanted to know. Did I do it for you?

1127
01:30:06,642 --> 01:30:08,685
Yeah, thanks.
Thank you very much.

1128
01:30:10,728 --> 01:30:12,854
So now what?
What are you going to do?

1129
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,273
I thought...

1130
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,776
...that I would
go back to the hospital.

1131
01:30:19,068 --> 01:30:23,238
They're really nice there. They
seem like they're trying to help me.

1132
01:30:23,613 --> 01:30:25,739
That's good, then.
You found something.

1133
01:30:26,532 --> 01:30:28,534
I don't know if I have or not.

1134
01:30:30,493 --> 01:30:32,578
Are you still
going to have the operation?

1135
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:34,120
Yeah!

1136
01:30:36,039 --> 01:30:39,291
So then, what am I
supposed to say to you?

1137
01:30:45,713 --> 01:30:46,964
Thanks a lot...

1138
01:30:49,007 --> 01:30:50,258
...and bon voyage.

1139
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:53,636
Yeah, right.
See you sometime.

1140
01:30:54,928 --> 01:30:56,596
I'll see you in my dreams.

1141
01:30:56,888 --> 01:30:58,973
Right, I'll write a song.

1142
01:31:02,393 --> 01:31:06,646
-I don't know. Life's so funny.
-You said a mouthful, sweetheart.

1143
01:31:12,859 --> 01:31:13,818
Goodbye, huh?

1144
01:31:45,508 --> 01:31:47,677
Give me....
Can I have--

1145
01:31:49,344 --> 01:31:52,181
You cut off the incoming calls.
Can I have a line?

1146
01:31:52,431 --> 01:31:54,932
I want to talk to my wife
and to my kids.

1147
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:57,517
He wants an outside line,
is it all right?

1148
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:00,729
I want a line.

1149
01:32:01,145 --> 01:32:02,396
I'm getting it.

1150
01:32:03,355 --> 01:32:06,691
I could call anybody,
they'd put them on the phone.

1151
01:32:07,567 --> 01:32:09,151
The Pope, an astronaut...

1152
01:32:10,444 --> 01:32:12,237
...the wisest of the wise.

1153
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:15,406
Who do I have to call?

1154
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,868
I just don't know what to do.

1155
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:29,000
Angie.

1156
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,835
Jesus!
I was watching it on TV.

1157
01:32:32,085 --> 01:32:35,588
-Where are the kids?
-I sent them to the neighbors.

1158
01:32:36,255 --> 01:32:40,050
I can't believe!
I mean, it ain't like you.

1159
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,218
I know.

1160
01:32:41,468 --> 01:32:44,261
You've never done anything
like it before on your life.

1161
01:32:44,512 --> 01:32:47,138
I'm dying, you know that?
I'm dying here.

1162
01:32:47,388 --> 01:32:52,059
I blame myself. I notice you been
tense, like something is happening.

1163
01:32:52,309 --> 01:32:55,394
Like that night you're yelling
at the kids like a madman.

1164
01:32:55,645 --> 01:32:57,146
Then you want me to go...

1165
01:32:57,396 --> 01:33:00,106
...on that ride, here
to there, full of those kids.

1166
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:03,734
It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go,
so you yell at me...

1167
01:33:03,984 --> 01:33:08,321
..."You pig, get on the fucking ride! "
Everything fell out of me.

1168
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:11,907
My heart, my liver,
just fell to the floor. Everything!

1169
01:33:12,157 --> 01:33:16,786
You know what it felt like? You yelling
at me in front of all those people?

1170
01:33:17,036 --> 01:33:19,330
You never talked to me
like that before.

1171
01:33:19,622 --> 01:33:23,124
I think, "He's going to shoot me
and dump my body in the river. "

1172
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:25,167
I was scared of you!

1173
01:33:25,459 --> 01:33:29,921
Will you shut the fuck up
and listen to me? Just listen to me!

1174
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:32,464
You see that?
With the language?

1175
01:33:32,756 --> 01:33:35,092
I'm trying to talk to you, and you--

1176
01:33:35,342 --> 01:33:37,093
A person can't communicate with you!

1177
01:33:37,343 --> 01:33:41,012
What am I here? I'm your wife.
I'm your wife!

1178
01:33:42,139 --> 01:33:44,391
You know something?
You hurt me.

1179
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:48,435
You hurt me, you know that?
Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1180
01:33:49,352 --> 01:33:51,437
Did I ever do anything
to make you do that?

1181
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:54,523
Did I ever turn you down or anything?

1182
01:33:54,773 --> 01:33:56,567
I know I let myself get fat.

1183
01:33:56,817 --> 01:34:00,069
-Don't call yourself fat.
-You can't stand me to say it.

1184
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:04,406
Like I can't stand you being
a bank robber. That's what love is.

1185
01:34:04,489 --> 01:34:06,907
Yeah? You know what love is?

1186
01:34:07,158 --> 01:34:10,577
If you know what love is so much,
why didn't you come down here?

1187
01:34:12,704 --> 01:34:14,830
Talk to me about love,
go ahead.

1188
01:34:15,831 --> 01:34:17,291
Sonny, I'm scared.

1189
01:34:17,541 --> 01:34:20,376
I'm scared. Are they
going to shoot me or something?

1190
01:34:20,626 --> 01:34:22,043
No, they're not!

1191
01:34:22,294 --> 01:34:26,213
You should see it on the TV.
They got cannons, machine guns.

1192
01:34:26,464 --> 01:34:28,507
They're after me, Angie, not you.

1193
01:34:28,757 --> 01:34:30,717
It's late already
by the time I find out...

1194
01:34:30,967 --> 01:34:34,720
...it's just you and Sal. I can't get
a babysitter! What'll I do?

1195
01:35:07,496 --> 01:35:10,790
I think I better take him back
for a cardiac check.

1196
01:35:21,839 --> 01:35:24,674
What's the matter?
He going to die or what?

1197
01:35:24,966 --> 01:35:29,261
It's just a precautionary measure.
It's awfully warm in here.

1198
01:35:42,063 --> 01:35:44,982
All right, then. Let's go,
let him out.

1199
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:47,234
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1200
01:35:48,151 --> 01:35:49,944
I just needed the injection.

1201
01:35:50,194 --> 01:35:54,447
You trying to be a hero?
You don't look good. We'll let you out.

1202
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:56,783
I'm not trying to be anything.

1203
01:35:57,408 --> 01:35:59,368
I just want to be left alone.

1204
01:36:01,786 --> 01:36:04,789
-No one is bothering you.
-I wish to fuck you never came!

1205
01:36:06,289 --> 01:36:07,457
That's all.

1206
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:11,085
Don't try to act like
you're an angel of human kindness.

1207
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:17,298
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1208
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,389
Out of the closet and into the streets!

1209
01:36:45,987 --> 01:36:49,739
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1210
01:37:19,596 --> 01:37:20,763
Ladies!

1211
01:37:25,308 --> 01:37:28,144
I want to apologize
for my use of language back there.

1212
01:37:28,894 --> 01:37:31,104
Why? What did you say?

1213
01:37:38,067 --> 01:37:38,735
What?

1214
01:37:38,985 --> 01:37:40,528
He said the 'F' word.

1215
01:37:40,779 --> 01:37:42,321
What did he say?

1216
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:44,156
He said the 'F' word.

1217
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:54,246
-Fuck.
-I know, Miriam!

1218
01:37:56,916 --> 01:38:00,710
I'm a Christian
and my ears are not garbage cans.

1219
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:11,218
-Then we shouldn't go after them.
-Then we won't.

1220
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:12,969
What's that?

1221
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:16,263
Could you come out, please?

1222
01:38:19,474 --> 01:38:20,600
My mother.

1223
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:25,229
Someone here to see you.

1224
01:38:25,521 --> 01:38:27,438
Could you come out, please?

1225
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,318
Sonny, could you come out, please?

1226
01:38:40,407 --> 01:38:42,784
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1227
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,994
I don't need you down here.

1228
01:38:47,204 --> 01:38:50,456
All of Brooklyn is out here.
Three networks of television.

1229
01:38:50,706 --> 01:38:54,084
-I got it all worked out, Ma.
-I talked to the man from the FBI.

1230
01:38:54,418 --> 01:38:56,252
Who?
No, don't talk to anybody.

1231
01:38:56,419 --> 01:38:59,797
He says if you come out now,
everything is going to be all right.

1232
01:39:00,089 --> 01:39:03,133
-I'm trying to get you out of this.
-Don't talk to the FBI.

1233
01:39:03,383 --> 01:39:04,633
I told them everything...

1234
01:39:04,842 --> 01:39:09,262
...how you were in the war in Vietnam,
I told them you always had good jobs.

1235
01:39:09,512 --> 01:39:13,098
I told them you were with Goldwater
in '64 in the convention and--

1236
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:16,268
Listen, I'm getting a plane
and I'm going to Algeria.

1237
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,394
I'll write you from there.

1238
01:39:18,894 --> 01:39:21,020
-I've got to go!
-I don't understand you.

1239
01:39:21,229 --> 01:39:24,274
If I stay and talk to you,
they won't send the limousine.

1240
01:39:24,566 --> 01:39:28,777
-They'll think I'll come out with you.
-What's the matter with that?

1241
01:39:29,027 --> 01:39:30,862
Because I'm not coming with you.

1242
01:39:31,112 --> 01:39:35,699
The FBI understands everything,
that it is not you that is doing this.

1243
01:39:35,949 --> 01:39:38,909
It's the pressures from your home life!

1244
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:42,662
-Don't get on Angie now.
-Did I say one word against her?

1245
01:39:42,954 --> 01:39:45,914
You were going to. She has
nothing to do with it, it's me!

1246
01:39:46,165 --> 01:39:48,542
Your life was sweetness and roses.

1247
01:39:49,418 --> 01:39:53,921
You wouldn't need Leon if Angie
was treating you right, you know that!

1248
01:39:54,254 --> 01:39:57,758
I don't understand why you
want to sleep with her anyway.

1249
01:39:58,008 --> 01:40:00,342
You got 2 kids on welfare now.

1250
01:40:00,593 --> 01:40:05,305
-You want 3 kids on welfare?
-I can't talk to you about this now.

1251
01:40:05,764 --> 01:40:08,098
What are you going to do?
Come out.

1252
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:09,391
I can't come out.
I can't.

1253
01:40:09,683 --> 01:40:11,434
Sal is in there with the people.

1254
01:40:11,684 --> 01:40:14,312
If I come out, he's going to kill them.

1255
01:40:14,604 --> 01:40:16,229
Run!

1256
01:40:16,521 --> 01:40:19,732
Run? Where am I going to run?
Ma, I can't run!

1257
01:40:19,982 --> 01:40:22,443
-Maybe--
-There's no maybe. No maybes.

1258
01:40:22,735 --> 01:40:25,612
You got to go home. Where's Pop?
He didn't come, did he?

1259
01:40:25,904 --> 01:40:29,365
Is he pissed off at you!
He says he doesn't have a son.

1260
01:40:30,115 --> 01:40:32,200
-He says you're dead.
-He's right.

1261
01:40:34,243 --> 01:40:36,578
I'm a fuck-up and an outcast
and that's it.

1262
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:40,247
You come near me, you're
going to get fucked over and fucked out!

1263
01:40:40,498 --> 01:40:43,417
Now, I got to go, Ma.
Get her home, okay?

1264
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:45,126
Just take her home.

1265
01:40:45,377 --> 01:40:48,046
How beautiful you were
when you were a baby!

1266
01:40:49,922 --> 01:40:51,673
Get her home now!

1267
01:41:01,347 --> 01:41:03,140
Ten minutes.

1268
01:41:18,985 --> 01:41:21,154
Being of sound mind...

1269
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:23,155
...and body....

1270
01:41:24,281 --> 01:41:25,949
You know what they....

1271
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:38,417
To my darling wife...

1272
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:40,794
...Leon...

1273
01:41:44,755 --> 01:41:46,548
...whom I love...

1274
01:41:50,801 --> 01:41:52,553
...more than any man...

1275
01:41:53,053 --> 01:41:55,054
...has loved another man...

1276
01:41:56,305 --> 01:41:57,849
...in all eternity.

1277
01:42:02,811 --> 01:42:04,145
I leave...

1278
01:42:06,105 --> 01:42:08,982
...$2,700...

1279
01:42:11,442 --> 01:42:14,903
...from my $10,000
life insurance policy...

1280
01:42:18,906 --> 01:42:20,365
...to be used...

1281
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:24,869
...for your sex change operation.

1282
01:42:31,082 --> 01:42:34,043
If there is any money left over...

1283
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:39,297
...I want it to go to you...

1284
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:43,884
...at my first...

1285
01:42:45,384 --> 01:42:48,554
...at the first anniversary
of my death...

1286
01:42:49,262 --> 01:42:50,722
...at my grave.

1287
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:01,730
To my wife...

1288
01:43:02,314 --> 01:43:03,982
...to my sweet wife...

1289
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:06,776
...Angela...

1290
01:43:10,445 --> 01:43:13,989
...$5,000 from the same policy.

1291
01:43:19,327 --> 01:43:21,287
You are the only woman...

1292
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:23,622
...that I ever loved.

1293
01:43:29,377 --> 01:43:32,295
And I repledge my love to you...

1294
01:43:34,588 --> 01:43:36,423
...in this sad moment.

1295
01:43:44,137 --> 01:43:46,889
To little Kimmy...

1296
01:43:48,391 --> 01:43:49,684
...and Timmy.

1297
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,895
I hope you remember me, Timmy.

1298
01:43:57,523 --> 01:43:59,691
You're the little man
of the family now...

1299
01:44:08,572 --> 01:44:11,741
...and I hope
you look after them for me.

1300
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:17,413
To my mother...

1301
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:23,418
...I ask forgiveness.

1302
01:44:28,587 --> 01:44:30,965
You don't understand...

1303
01:44:33,883 --> 01:44:35,719
...the things I said...

1304
01:44:37,136 --> 01:44:38,554
...and did.

1305
01:44:41,848 --> 01:44:44,434
But I'm me and I'm different.

1306
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,398
I want a military funeral...

1307
01:44:58,485 --> 01:45:01,738
...and I'm entitled to have one,
free of charge.

1308
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:10,202
God bless you...

1309
01:45:12,455 --> 01:45:13,955
...and watch over you...

1310
01:45:17,959 --> 01:45:20,586
...till we are joined in the hereafter.

1311
01:45:35,347 --> 01:45:38,475
Here, I'll sign.
I'll spell that last name.

1312
01:45:44,354 --> 01:45:45,480
Watch out!

1313
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:55,029
Come on, Sarge, just one picture?

1314
01:46:02,952 --> 01:46:04,702
Back, back!

1315
01:46:34,225 --> 01:46:35,685
You the driver?

1316
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,855
I want to check it out.

1317
01:46:44,984 --> 01:46:46,025
Seats come out?

1318
01:46:46,401 --> 01:46:47,568
They're bolted.

1319
01:46:55,491 --> 01:46:58,201
All right, here.
Light me on that side.

1320
01:46:59,703 --> 01:47:00,745
Over there.

1321
01:47:13,964 --> 01:47:16,340
You're the man, huh?

1322
01:47:17,717 --> 01:47:20,051
I was watching.
I saw you, man!

1323
01:47:21,594 --> 01:47:24,555
You should see yourself,
you wouldn't believe it!

1324
01:47:24,847 --> 01:47:26,223
I believe it.

1325
01:47:26,473 --> 01:47:27,640
Sheila won't!

1326
01:47:28,308 --> 01:47:29,892
-Who?
-My old lady!

1327
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:33,353
They said, "Gas up a stretch,
go to 285 Prospect Park West. "

1328
01:47:33,604 --> 01:47:35,646
Give me some light over here.

1329
01:47:36,063 --> 01:47:38,733
I said, "Shit, another load
from the massage parlors! "

1330
01:47:56,412 --> 01:47:57,413
It's okay.

1331
01:47:57,872 --> 01:47:59,832
I'm going to remember you.

1332
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:09,756
This is Agent Murphy.
He'll be your driver.

1333
01:48:10,048 --> 01:48:11,382
No, I want him.

1334
01:48:14,384 --> 01:48:16,761
-Give me the black guy.
-I'm not into that shit.

1335
01:48:17,011 --> 01:48:18,220
Nobody will hurt you.

1336
01:48:19,263 --> 01:48:22,223
If they were going to shoot,
they would've shot already.

1337
01:48:22,432 --> 01:48:24,309
-I can't allow that, Sonny.
-You can't allow?

1338
01:48:25,351 --> 01:48:28,729
What makes you think you can
say shit to me? I'm running this.

1339
01:48:30,063 --> 01:48:32,690
I'll pay you. What do you want?
$100? $200?

1340
01:48:32,857 --> 01:48:34,566
$1,000? Come on.

1341
01:48:35,776 --> 01:48:37,735
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1342
01:48:42,572 --> 01:48:44,074
Look, it'll be an adventure.

1343
01:48:49,453 --> 01:48:52,580
You men that shoot,
aim for white meat.

1344
01:49:00,836 --> 01:49:01,921
Take a walk.

1345
01:49:04,089 --> 01:49:05,090
Give me him.

1346
01:49:07,424 --> 01:49:08,926
Think I'm an idiot?

1347
01:49:11,386 --> 01:49:12,762
Take a walk, cop!

1348
01:49:17,891 --> 01:49:20,101
Everybody is a con man.

1349
01:49:25,313 --> 01:49:27,107
I want everyone across the street.

1350
01:49:28,774 --> 01:49:31,151
I want them all back,
on the sidewalk!

1351
01:49:31,401 --> 01:49:32,819
Let's go!

1352
01:49:33,528 --> 01:49:35,821
At least I know
who I'm dealing with now.

1353
01:49:39,074 --> 01:49:41,117
Here's a pen for you.
Come on!

1354
01:49:51,709 --> 01:49:53,585
Don't move, okay?

1355
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,173
Here's your document.

1356
01:50:01,299 --> 01:50:03,551
-Thanks.
-You've got to sign it!

1357
01:50:06,595 --> 01:50:08,013
We're taking off.

1358
01:50:08,263 --> 01:50:09,597
We're going now.

1359
01:50:10,264 --> 01:50:12,182
Sal! Where is he?

1360
01:50:14,475 --> 01:50:16,185
That's it, we're going.

1361
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,104
Here, people, let's go!
We're going.

1362
01:50:19,771 --> 01:50:23,482
-Can I get my sweater?
-Get what you had when you came in.

1363
01:50:41,371 --> 01:50:42,663
How are you doing?

1364
01:50:42,914 --> 01:50:44,040
Good.

1365
01:50:44,290 --> 01:50:46,541
We're going to do it, right?

1366
01:50:47,042 --> 01:50:48,919
We're going to do it.

1367
01:50:49,169 --> 01:50:51,754
You got to keep your eye on him.
He's the driver.

1368
01:50:52,004 --> 01:50:54,298
-I need it.
-No, it's mine.

1369
01:50:54,547 --> 01:50:56,758
You got to keep
your eye on him, see?

1370
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,638
All right,
where am I now?

1371
01:52:01,598 --> 01:52:03,141
All right, hold it!

1372
01:52:04,434 --> 01:52:05,977
All right, let's go.

1373
01:52:06,894 --> 01:52:08,938
Swing around now.

1374
01:52:10,355 --> 01:52:12,065
Just keep holding hands.

1375
01:52:18,111 --> 01:52:19,112
Hold it!

1376
01:52:21,864 --> 01:52:24,074
Break it on "3. "
Not yet, don't break it.

1377
01:52:28,703 --> 01:52:29,829
Go!

1378
01:52:41,045 --> 01:52:43,046
Fuck, we did it!

1379
01:52:43,422 --> 01:52:44,631
We did it!

1380
01:52:44,923 --> 01:52:46,174
Wish us luck!

1381
01:52:51,136 --> 01:52:52,304
You got your one.

1382
01:52:52,929 --> 01:52:54,014
Follow my car.

1383
01:53:07,024 --> 01:53:08,566
Get me Kennedy.

1384
01:53:09,942 --> 01:53:11,319
We did it!

1385
01:53:13,361 --> 01:53:15,696
I'll be a son of a bitch!
We did it!

1386
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:19,283
Okay, let's move.
Come on, honk the horn.

1387
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:24,161
Do me a favor, will you?

1388
01:53:24,411 --> 01:53:27,372
Keep the gun pointed up.
We hit a bump, it'll go off.

1389
01:53:37,713 --> 01:53:39,006
You set out there?

1390
01:53:42,509 --> 01:53:44,344
We're leaving now.

1391
01:53:44,594 --> 01:53:46,428
We want no trouble en route.

1392
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:50,681
Intersection check?

1393
01:53:53,433 --> 01:53:55,393
We'll be starting up right now.

1394
01:53:55,644 --> 01:53:56,895
10-4.

1395
01:54:28,919 --> 01:54:30,337
It'll be all right.

1396
01:54:57,816 --> 01:55:00,818
You just have to remember
to keep the gun pointed up.

1397
01:57:27,847 --> 01:57:29,055
What's he doing?

1398
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:31,808
He's still got some
arrangements to make.

1399
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:50,697
Sal, see it?
There it is.

1400
01:58:47,532 --> 01:58:49,158
I forgot!

1401
01:58:49,408 --> 01:58:51,535
I forgot to ask if they
got food on board.

1402
01:58:56,413 --> 01:58:57,956
Do they have food on board?

1403
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:05,170
Your jet.

1404
01:59:05,587 --> 01:59:07,631
We get one more now.
That's the deal.

1405
01:59:07,881 --> 01:59:10,174
Right.
Okay, who goes?

1406
01:59:10,674 --> 01:59:11,759
Sylvia?

1407
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,303
Maria.

1408
01:59:23,267 --> 01:59:25,268
I'll pray for you.

1409
01:59:28,105 --> 01:59:30,356
Because this is your first plane trip...

1410
01:59:30,648 --> 01:59:32,942
...don't be scared, okay?

1411
01:59:46,493 --> 01:59:49,663
I didn't eat all day.
Will there be any food on board?

1412
01:59:50,038 --> 01:59:51,580
There'll be hamburgers.
Ready?

1413
01:59:57,419 --> 01:59:58,460
Ready to go?

1414
01:59:59,711 --> 02:00:00,796
Yeah.

1415
02:00:06,883 --> 02:00:08,218
Let's move.

1416
02:00:12,388 --> 02:00:15,473
We don't want any accidents
at this point, right?

1417
02:00:15,807 --> 02:00:17,559
Keep your gun pointed up.

1418
02:00:19,810 --> 02:00:21,520
Ready to get out first?

1419
02:00:21,854 --> 02:00:22,729
Ready.

1420
02:00:28,233 --> 02:00:29,234
Don't shoot me.

1421
02:01:08,222 --> 02:01:09,681
Now spread them!

1422
02:01:15,811 --> 02:01:17,437
We're all secure here.

1423
02:01:17,729 --> 02:01:20,231
Murphy will report from the car.

1424
02:01:24,943 --> 02:01:26,527
You make the report.

1425
02:01:26,819 --> 02:01:28,196
Put the gun down.

1426
02:01:28,446 --> 02:01:29,697
Back off.

1427
02:01:30,572 --> 02:01:32,282
Get up now, Sonny.

1428
02:01:33,241 --> 02:01:34,700
You're under arrest.

1429
02:01:34,992 --> 02:01:37,078
You have the right to remain silent.

1430
02:01:37,328 --> 02:01:40,830
You have the right to an attorney
during your interrogation.

1431
02:01:41,122 --> 02:01:45,292
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1432
02:01:45,542 --> 02:01:47,710
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer...

1433
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:51,880
...one will be appointed
to represent you if you wish one.

1434
02:02:05,641 --> 02:02:08,351
Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...

1435
02:02:08,643 --> 02:02:11,978
...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?

1436
02:02:12,229 --> 02:02:13,230
Repeat:

1437
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:16,774
Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...

1438
02:02:17,274 --> 02:02:21,444
...until the hostages are well
inside the terminal?

1439
02:02:21,694 --> 02:02:24,029
Yeah, I got you.
We'll hold here.
