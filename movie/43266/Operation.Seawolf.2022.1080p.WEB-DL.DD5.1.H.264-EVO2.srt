1.
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,943
鱼雷已经准备好了。
命令，先生？
2.
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:35,150
战斗站！
3.
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,341
战斗站。
4.
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,377
船长
5.
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:03,245
快乐的狩猎。
6.
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,859
海浪会过去的。
7.
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,262
记住你的训练，
这对你很有好处。
8.
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:26,034
船长
9
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:27,968
洪水一和二！
10
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,304
火
11
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:34,875
45秒冲击。
12
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:43,251
先生，发生什么事了？
13
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,859
敲打我们？
14
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:58,200
所有电源
朝着引擎走去，快点。
15
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,761
先生，我们必须
试试看表面。
16
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:39,174
弃船。
17
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,042
弃船！
18
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:42,210
弃船。
19
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,394
先生
20
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:06,368
你会做得很好的
总有一天，凯斯勒。
21
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:18,246
这是我的责任。
22
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:24,272
长官，海狼行动。
23
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:30,211
德国人正在准备
导弹武装潜艇攻击
24
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:31,679
对美国海岸。
25
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,388
连接V-1火箭
9型潜艇？
26
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,426
看起来很像，先生。
27
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,271
这是谁？
28
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,473
级别高的
海因里希·凯斯勒指挥官，
29
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:02,677
第13支小分队，铁十字奖得主，
在大战中受伤。
30
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:05,547
U-Boat从一开始就很出色。
31
00:07:06,614 --> 00:07:08,283
佩奇命令他的狼群。
32
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,252
这是一个非常危险的人。
33
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:14,422
好吧，留着我
通知任何更新。
34
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:16,023
是的，先生。
35
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:04,632
这是宣传。
36
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,103
你们这些德国人和宣传人员。
37
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:15,243
我必须走了。
38
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:20,615
If it's all propaganda,
why must you go?

39
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:27,121
Duty.

40
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:30,725
Oh, what is duty, leaving
everything you love behind?

41
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:07,915
I keep them there to remember.

42
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:17,859
Once, this room
was filled with friends.

43
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,362
But now,
we are all that is left.

44
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:25,767
How are you, my friend?

45
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:27,802
- Good?
- Good.

46
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:31,405
Good.

47
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,544
Commander.

48
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:38,813
Heil Hitler.

49
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:40,281
Heil Hitler.

50
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:55,396
Even at the end,
we are soldiers.

51
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,600
Gentlemen, I need a moment
alone with this man.

52
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:02,303
Please.

53
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:12,613
We have much to discuss,
not a lot of time.

54
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:13,681
Follow me.

55
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:15,817
Yes, sir.

56
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,547
What are my orders, Commander?

57
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:48,816
Why am I here?

58
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:51,053
Straight to the point.

59
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:55,656
It is no secret, the U-boats
have been performing poorly.

60
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,458
The British and the Americans

61
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:00,761
have made
it a priority to hunt us down.

62
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:01,996
The Fuhrer has not been pleased.

63
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,933
The Fuhrer needed more boats,

64
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,501
ask to bring in the others.

65
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,004
Let me show you something.

66
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:22,550
You see this?

67
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:27,855
It's the American coast.

68
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:30,691
New York City, the heart
of the American war effort.

69
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:32,660
Operation Sea wolf.

70
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,899
We tried these operations,
we have failed.

71
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:48,076
V-1 rocket,
Hitler's wonder weapon.

72
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,049
We shall equip these
rockets to our U-boats

73
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,917
and attack the American coast.

74
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,189
Our fleets will strike fear
into the heart of the enemy.

75
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:03,958
You will lead the pack.

76
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,501
At the beginning of the war,

77
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:17,939
our pack ruled the waves,
steel, blood, fire, fear.

78
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,642
These were our thoughts.

79
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:24,779
Now we have our dreams
of one of our person,

80
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,748
victory is out of our grasp.

81
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,455
The Fuhrer has spared no
expense for this operation.

82
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,226
No expense.

83
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:39,961
None.

84
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,001
A pack needs wolves.

85
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,074
Let me show you some wolves.

86
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,750
Attention.

87
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:11,993
Your wolves.

88
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:29,111
These are not wolves but boys.

89
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,181
Young boys.

90
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,283
Were you and
I much different from them?

91
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:36,984
When the war started,

92
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:40,188
I spent nine months with my
men before going into action.

93
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,860
They have had the finest
training Germany has to offer.

94
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,131
Do they know what the risks are?

95
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:50,998
They know the risks.

96
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:54,835
They are ready to die
for country and Fuhrer.

97
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:08,050
These are not Kriegsmarine.

98
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:12,187
Then teach them Kriegsmarine.

99
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:12,247
I will do it.

100
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,327
Operation Sea wolf.

101
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:30,831
You will leave with three ships.

102
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:33,135
Seven more will join you
when you are out to sea.

103
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:38,806
10 boats.

104
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:42,977
You will be the spear
point for more to follow.

105
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:50,418
And I'll see our targets?

106
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,920
Allied shipping lanes,
north of New York.

107
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,821
The missile attack?

108
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:55,123
New York City.

109
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,294
Departure?

110
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,829
The crews await your word.

111
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:06,434
I believe I'd first,

112
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:11,306
I like to meet my
officers and see the boat.

113
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,108
I would expect nothing less.

114
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:23,017
The officers of U-546.

115
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,391
You, Lieutenant.

116
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,092
Lieutenant Erich Reinhart, sir.

117
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,128
Acting captain of U-546.

118
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:34,828
Captain?

119
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:38,832
Reinhart was
in line to be captain,

120
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,835
but under your leadership
he was glad to step aside.

121
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:45,073
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

122
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,078
I'm looking forward to
serving under your command.

123
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:52,880
The boat?

124
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,115
Lieutenant Lutz.

125
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,783
- Operational?
- Engines are ready, sir.

126
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,288
Lieutenant Handel Speer, sir.

127
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:01,722
The crew is in high morale, sir.

128
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:05,227
Good, good.

129
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:13,201
Good. Let's go inspect
my boat and get some food.

130
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:29,517
Sea wolf.

131
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:33,221
Let the Commander know
I need to see him now.

132
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:34,289
Yes, sir.

133
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:48,436
Commander?

134
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,903
Come in.

135
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,474
Operation Sea wolf is a go.

136
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,077
Confirmed?

137
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,079
Just came over
the wires, confirmed by Enigma.

138
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:00,482
War room.

139
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,017
- We got our work to do.
- Yes, sir.

140
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:25,066
Morning, sir.

141
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:29,204
Well, Heinrich.

142
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,071
The time has come.

143
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:34,109
The ghosts stay here in port.

144
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:37,512
It's now just you,
the crew, and the mission.

145
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:39,481
Are you prepared?

146
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:46,421
If the crew is half as good
as the boats, I'm confident

147
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:51,526
under the circumstances.

148
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:54,129
There it is then.

149
00:22:56,598 --> 00:23:01,536
I leave you to your second
home, the sea and the ship.

150
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:05,507
Good luck, my friend.

151
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,310
Good luck to you.

152
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:29,097
Attention.

153
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:48,349
At ease.

154
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,458
I know you do not know me.

155
00:23:58,293 --> 00:23:59,127
I do not know you.

156
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:06,067
The men of the sea are
a special brotherhood,

157
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,603
a bond forged out of the ocean.

158
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:13,608
A U-boat's
crew is life, the blood.

159
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:18,446
Our worth will be measured
to surface of the sea.

160
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:23,485
I know each one of
you will do your duty.

161
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:27,188
I will not disappoint you.

162
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:32,093
Do not disappoint me.

163
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:36,064
All hands to stations.

164
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:37,332
You heard the Captain.

165
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,466
All hands to stations.

166
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:45,406
Take her out, engine six
knots, starboard 108 degrees.

167
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:48,076
Yes Captain, Lutz.

168
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:52,480
Ollie, engine six knots,
starboard 108 degrees.

169
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:14,702
Captain, the boat
is sailing at six knots.

170
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:16,804
Diesels are running
smoothly, batteries charged.

171
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:19,707
Good. Take her down
to periscope depth.

172
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,277
Want her under the surface.

173
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:25,113
Yes, Captain.

174
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,481
Periscope depth.

175
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,549
Periscope depth.

176
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,198
Intelligence has
indicated the U-boat pack

177
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:45,600
has left their pens at Trondheim

178
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,535
and are making for open ocean.

179
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:49,671
They'll drop down into
the Northern fishing lanes.

180
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:51,339
They'll hide in and out of them.

181
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,608
They will be using snorkels,
it's hard to track.

182
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,376
Yeah, they'll be going slow.

183
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:57,278
Give us a chance to get
into position and intercept.

184
00:25:57,545 --> 00:25:59,847
The 10th fleet is ready with
escort carriers and destroyers.

185
00:25:59,948 --> 00:26:01,583
Okay, contact Commander Emmetts.

186
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:05,186
Split his forces, half
goes north, half south.

187
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:06,588
I don't wanna take any chances.

188
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,191
Nothing better than a wolf hunt.

189
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:11,593
No, sir.

190
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:56,838
Port four degrees,
right full rudder.

191
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:58,640
- Keep her steady.
- Aye aye, sir.

192
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,308
Port four degrees,
right turn rudder.

193
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,678
Captain, orders from Emmetts.

194
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:06,648
Yes, sir?

195
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:10,551
Thank you, sir.

196
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:14,489
Starboard,
right runner, 10 knots.

197
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,523
Changing course.

198
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:18,693
Operation Teardrop is a go.

199
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,262
They're really going
to let us hunt subs?

200
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:22,363
Oh, we are in the hunt.

201
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:24,265
Yes, sir.

202
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,435
- Helmsman?
- Aye aye, sir.

203
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,500
Apologies, Captain.

204
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,569
I haven't had a chance
to finish cleaning out

205
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:35,636
my personal belongings.

206
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,239
Hitler youth.

207
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,612
His blood, his honor.
It was my brother's.

208
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,549
He was killed in
Normandy by Americans.

209
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:54,522
I'm sorry to
hear that, Lieutenant.

210
00:28:58,426 --> 00:28:59,894
Now, I understand
I'm taking your command

211
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:01,763
of this boat away.

212
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:03,965
You are my second in command,

213
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,601
you must obey all my
orders without question.

214
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,468
Is that clear?

215
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:08,903
Yes, Captain.

216
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:12,340
On this boat, we all
have a duty to perform.

217
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,044
Under my command, what matters
is the defeat of the enemy,

218
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:19,047
the lives of the crew, and
the safety of this boat.

219
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,315
Understood?

220
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:23,551
Yes, sir.

221
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:24,852
Good.

222
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:25,820
Now what's your report?

223
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:28,956
U-894 is falling behind.

224
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,326
Why is he falling behind?

225
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,594
Engine trouble.

226
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:39,867
Radio U-578, let him know.

227
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,069
Yes, sir.

228
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,637
Keep her sturdy and on course.

229
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,940
We have to make up for
any time we might lose.

230
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:48,009
Yes, Captain.

231
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,850
- Sleeping little boy?
- Sleeping.

232
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:02,817
Do you plan on using that?

233
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:04,986
What?

234
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:05,920
I hope not on me.

235
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:08,090
Don't tempt me.

236
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:10,024
I never got my knife.

237
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:13,561
My family couldn't afford it.

238
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:15,863
Didn't have enough money.

239
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,035
How is our new Captain?

240
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:23,404
Settled into my quarters.

241
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,045
The whole crew is on your side.

242
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:32,747
Men like Kessler,

243
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:36,617
their time has passed.

244
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:44,059
Get the diesels up and running.

245
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,593
Send reports every 20 minutes.

246
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,462
Captain's orders.

247
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,698
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

248
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:51,732
Heil Hitler.

249
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,672
Helmsman.

250
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,573
Right rudder, 20 degrees.

251
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,575
Maintaining current course.

252
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:03,577
Sir, we have sonar contact.

253
00:32:03,678 --> 00:32:05,579
- Ships on the surface?
- I think so, sir.

254
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:08,083
What is it?

255
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:09,217
Contact with the enemy.

256
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:11,086
Do you have the boats confirmed?

257
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,554
Reinhart, check.

258
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,589
Yes, sir.

259
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,724
Should I get the captain?

260
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,459
Not yet.

261
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:23,564
Reinhart, report!

262
00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:26,567
Sir, multiple
ships coming in fast.

263
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,785
The other U-boats
were reporting the same.

264
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:45,953
I have visual contact.

265
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,923
- Convoy?
- Yes.

266
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:52,560
U-578 is asking to engage.

267
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:54,628
What should we tell them?

268
00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:58,133
This could be our first kill.

269
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:00,168
We can't give that order.

270
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,037
We need the captain.

271
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:06,174
Give the order to engage.

272
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:08,976
Yes, sir.

273
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:13,948
Now get the Captain.

274
00:33:16,884 --> 00:33:17,718
Yes, sir.

275
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,633
Why have the diesels stopped?

276
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:36,138
Captain, enemy contact,
convoy merchant vessels,

277
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:38,005
U-578 has started to engage.

278
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:39,174
Who gave that order?

279
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:41,575
Torpedoes in the water!

280
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,078
Captain, torpedoes in the water.

281
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:45,946
Up periscope, move.

282
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:47,548
Up periscope!

283
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:14,842
It's a hit.

284
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:16,644
It's a hit.

285
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:30,991
Another hit. Another hit.

286
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:36,597
Ready the torpedoes.

287
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,901
I will call off the ranges.
Battle stations.

288
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:45,073
Battle stations!

289
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,343
Battle stations,
battle stations,

290
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,345
battle stations,
battle stations!

291
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:09,897
Sir, a convoy was just hit.
Looks like U-Boats.

292
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:11,799
- Where?
- Grid section 473.

293
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,404
That's our pack. Launch
all the birds from Greely.

294
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,406
I want all
available forces on that spot.

295
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,975
- I'll inform the 10th.
- I need all eyes out there.

296
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:22,410
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

297
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:50,838
The snorkel is
giving us trouble.

298
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,441
It'd be better if
we get to the surface.

299
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,775
Damaged?

300
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,744
Hard to tell unless
we get to the surface.

301
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:58,746
Call the engine room.

302
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:08,056
- Yeah?
- The electric motor's charging?

303
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:09,890
Not sufficiently.

304
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,126
The diesels?

305
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:12,460
Might be best to
do a surface check.

306
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:14,462
Right.

307
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:19,967
What's going on?

308
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:21,835
Batteries are
not fully charging.

309
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:24,239
We need to go to the surface
and check the snorkel.

310
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:25,739
Take it to the surface.

311
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,708
Radio?

312
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,277
Inform the other
boats we are surfacing

313
00:36:29,377 --> 00:36:30,811
for a maintenance check.

314
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:31,912
Yes, sir.

315
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:34,249
Rouse the deck crew!

316
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,885
Take us to the surface.

317
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:38,953
Yes, sir.

318
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:19,060
Where's the Captain?

319
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:21,829
Passed out again.

320
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,166
Keep her steady.

321
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,235
I don't need
anybody going overboard.

322
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:38,079
We have an issue.

323
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:42,983
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

324
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:46,787
What is going on?

325
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,426
Get the machine guns
from the weapons rack.

326
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:54,928
Weapons!

327
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,474
Survivors?

328
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,444
It's not clear.

329
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:12,314
We can't take on survivors.

330
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:16,418
Ready the deck guns,

331
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:19,154
we can't take any chances.

332
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:20,455
Won't the Captain notice?

333
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,924
He will think he gave the order.

334
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:24,992
Right.

335
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:36,438
Is that a deck gun?

336
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:38,273
- Yes, sir.
- Who are they shooting at?

337
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:39,873
We spotted lifeboats.

338
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:41,476
I thought it best
to leave no survivors.

339
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:43,345
I did not give that order.

340
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,047
Can't the survivors
give away our location?

341
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:48,450
Idiot.
We could be spotted.

342
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:50,851
Sir, who could see us out here?

343
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:52,120
Aircraft.

344
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,456
Get the men below. Now, go.

345
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,215
All hands to battle stations.

346
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:21,349
Prepare the ship to dive.

347
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:26,388
Inform the other submarines
of evasive action.

348
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:33,994
Engine room,
95% to both engines.

349
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:34,662
Now.

350
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:46,508
There!

351
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:49,677
Quickly.

352
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:07,295
Incoming!

353
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:10,098
Incoming!

354
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,101
What is going on?

355
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:14,469
We're under air attack.

356
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,506
Fire!

357
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,046
Get up, we don't have much time.

358
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,455
Speer.

359
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:36,990
Speer!

360
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,073
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

361
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:59,481
Pull the ballast.
We need to dive, now.

362
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:01,716
Prepare to dive.
Close the ballast.

363
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:07,322
They are coming in
for the another attack.

364
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:08,423
Where's the others?

365
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:09,624
They are dead.

366
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,395
- Sir, we can...
- You put the life of this crew and this boat in danger.

367
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:17,465
Lieutenant Lutz,
confine Lieutenant Reinhart

368
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:19,133
to the mess
quarters under guard.

369
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:22,002
- Sir.
- You must decide whose orders you follow.

370
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:27,475
Dive. Dive!

371
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,601
Sir, Navy planes
have engaged the sub.

372
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:58,540
- What's the location?
- Grid section 9-47-4.

373
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:09,150
Get the fleet to make
for grid section 1455.

374
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:12,620
- This could be our break. Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,143
Left full rudder.

376
00:42:35,243 --> 00:42:36,644
- Left full rudder.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:40,381
Sir, U-578 has
made sonar contact

378
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:41,749
with ships on the surface.

379
00:42:43,718 --> 00:42:45,286
Up periscope.

380
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,821
- Yes, sir.
- Up periscope.

381
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:03,438
Periscope depth, sir.

382
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,336
Take it down to 50 meters.

383
00:43:35,436 --> 00:43:36,404
Sir?

384
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:40,408
American destroyers, carriers.

385
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:41,476
50 meters, sir.

386
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,618
Ollie.

387
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:52,420
- Up five, down 10.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:02,797
Now hear this,
this is the Captain.

389
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,901
We made surface
contact with enemy ships.

390
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:10,271
<i>We'll the ships head on.</i>

391
00:44:11,939 --> 00:44:12,840
We're underneath them.

392
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:16,844
<i>Close enough for
the sonar not to pick up.</i>

393
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,715
With any luck,

394
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:22,316
we'll pass unnoticed.

395
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:40,368
Keep on the present course.

396
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:41,235
Yes, sir.

397
00:44:43,271 --> 00:44:46,474
We should be under the boats,
in the clear, seven minutes.

398
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:48,943
Seven minutes?

399
00:44:51,345 --> 00:44:52,480
Set.

400
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,894
Sir.

401
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:07,895
Something on sonar.

402
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:11,632
Have the jersey
bear 20 degrees port.

403
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:13,568
Aye, sir.

404
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,403
Wait for my orders and then
proceed to drop depth charges.

405
00:45:15,937 --> 00:45:18,372
Port 15 degrees, half speed.

406
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:19,540
Right standard rudder.

407
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,808
Aye aye, sir.

408
00:45:51,706 --> 00:45:52,740
Four minutes.

409
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:55,643
There you go, sir.

410
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:56,911
Thank you.

411
00:45:59,814 --> 00:46:02,884
Sir, contact bearing
two niner five port side.

412
00:46:02,984 --> 00:46:04,619
- Go for jersey.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:05,987
- Drop depth charges.
- Aye, sir.

414
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:25,673
Two minutes.

415
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:49,864
Come on, come on.

416
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:57,805
Launch hedgehogs!

417
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,858
Sir?

418
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,994
Oil slick on the water.

419
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:56,697
We got 'em!

420
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,880
The 10th is reporting contact
and taking men in a sub.

421
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:15,050
- Just one?
- For now.

422
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:17,085
It's a pack!

423
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,855
- There's more than one.
- Right, sir.

424
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:22,957
Tell them to keep hunting. Go.

425
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:39,573
We are safe.

426
00:48:44,146 --> 00:48:47,049
Sir, we've lost
contact with U-578.

427
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:49,650
Nothing but static.

428
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:57,959
We continue.
We have our orders.

429
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,760
Keep her steady, six knots.

430
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:02,197
We surface at nightfall.

431
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:03,664
Yes, sir.

432
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:26,188
The captain needs small arms.

433
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:28,656
Two machine pistols.

434
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:30,524
I'm going to need to confirm.

435
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:52,114
Sir.

436
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:55,117
The 10th has lost sonar contact.

437
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:58,552
They are sweeping the area, but
so far, no new developments.

438
00:49:58,652 --> 00:50:00,155
If there were more boats,
they got away.

439
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,161
Keep 'em sweeping
back towards the coast.

440
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:08,929
Contact the Coast Guard
and double their patrols.

441
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:09,964
Keep their eyes open.

442
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:11,033
Yes, sir.

443
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:28,150
Sergeant.

444
00:50:29,683 --> 00:50:32,920
Let them know we have to
join the other U-boats.

445
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,291
- Yes, sir.
- Attack on the United States coast is imminent.

446
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:37,259
Yes, sir.

447
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,094
Sir.

448
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,861
We have a problem.

449
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,330
What?

450
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:43,831
It's Lieutenant Reinhart.

451
00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:00,614
Stay back.

452
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:15,963
Reinhart.

453
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:35,150
Stay back!

454
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:41,289
Lieutenant,
hand that pistol over.

455
00:51:42,157 --> 00:51:43,657
We'll forget
about this incident.

456
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:48,796
I got those men killed.

457
00:51:50,298 --> 00:51:51,799
They are dead because of me.

458
00:51:54,035 --> 00:51:55,070
I failed my ship.

459
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:59,241
I failed the crew,
and I failed you.

460
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,311
Your failure, with thanks
to my poor leadership.

461
00:52:04,212 --> 00:52:05,946
Hand the pistol over.

462
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:07,415
I said stay back!

463
00:52:14,156 --> 00:52:15,257
During the Great War,

464
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,096
a new branch of service,
U-boat, became available.

465
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:24,199
Many of my peers volunteered.

466
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,102
Few were chosen.

467
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:28,303
I was one of the few.

468
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:38,380
My first day at sea,
a man was washed overboard.

469
00:52:39,047 --> 00:52:43,051
I asked the captain to start
a rescue operation, he refused.

470
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:50,392
On a U-boat, every man's
decided his own fate.

471
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,296
Destiny takes control.

472
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:55,896
We cannot look back.

473
00:52:57,065 --> 00:52:57,932
We must look forward.

474
00:53:03,938 --> 00:53:06,274
My duty is to use every man on
this ship to complete our mission.

475
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:08,043
That includes you, Reinhart.

476
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,372
Do not let the mistakes of your
past determine your future.

477
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:53,121
Your watch starts
in five minutes. Go.

478
00:53:58,593 --> 00:53:59,793
Yes, Captain.

479
00:55:42,397 --> 00:55:43,498
We have contact.

480
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,168
We are close to the coast.

481
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:48,036
Yes, sir.

482
00:55:50,003 --> 00:55:52,474
Notify the engine room.
Cut power to the diesels.

483
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:54,509
Yes, sir.

484
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:56,144
Where's Lieutenant Reinhart?

485
00:55:56,378 --> 00:55:57,345
He's on watch.

486
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,049
I'm going up top.

487
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,217
Yes, sir.

488
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:22,036
Cold night.

489
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:24,239
Yes, sir.

490
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,516
If we keep her on our
starboard, she won't notice us.

491
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:37,252
How?

492
00:56:38,753 --> 00:56:40,388
At night,
the outline of our boat

493
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:41,689
will line up with her stern.

494
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:45,560
A blind spot?

495
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,428
Yes.

496
00:56:48,296 --> 00:56:49,697
Make sure to keep
her on our starboard.

497
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:51,699
Yes, sir.

498
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,571
Wonderful one.

499
00:56:58,239 --> 00:56:59,274
Sir?

500
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:04,279
I was part of the wonderful
youth when I was a boy.

501
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:08,616
I've heard of them, sir.

502
00:57:09,484 --> 00:57:11,052
Good, carry on Lieutenant.

503
00:57:11,152 --> 00:57:11,719
Yes, sir.

504
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:17,192
Word from
the 10th fleet in the south.

505
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:18,560
They have just
sunk three U-boats.

506
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:20,728
What about the north?

507
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:22,664
- Nothing yet, sir.
- Nothing.

508
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,065
Don't like it.

509
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,067
One could sneak through.

510
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:29,103
They'll be
closing in. We will find them.

511
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,122
Sir,
engines are performing 100%.

512
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:50,225
We should be upon
New York Harbor in a day.

513
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:51,992
Have we heard
from the other U-boats?

514
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:52,660
No, sir.

515
00:57:55,163 --> 00:57:58,366
How long would it take to
ready us to launch the attack?

516
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:01,669
Should take five, six hours
to load the missile on deck.

517
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:05,473
We don't have
time to make mistakes.

518
00:58:05,573 --> 00:58:07,175
We can't make mistakes, sir.

519
00:58:08,543 --> 00:58:10,044
Ships on the horizon, captain.

520
00:58:11,346 --> 00:58:12,480
Merchant?

521
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,681
They look like Navy ships.

522
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:17,585
Sir, I have multiple
contacts on the sonar.

523
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,053
They're coming in fast.

524
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:23,258
Battle stations.

525
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:25,126
Battle stations!

526
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:35,370
Ships on our starboard and port.

527
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:43,778
American warships.

528
00:58:43,878 --> 00:58:45,547
- Have they spotted us?
- Not yet.

529
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,515
Could at any minute.

530
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:54,255
Load the torpedoes, the
target is the merchant ship.

531
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:57,158
- We are going to attack?
- Yes, Lieutenant, now go.

532
00:58:57,258 --> 00:58:57,825
Yes, sir.

533
00:59:40,902 --> 00:59:42,737
Torpedoes
await your command, sir.

534
00:59:43,771 --> 00:59:44,839
Port 90 degrees.

535
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:47,175
Port 90 degrees.

536
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:48,309
Port 90 degrees, sir.

537
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,717
Loose torpedo number one.

538
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:56,718
Loose torpedo number one.

539
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:58,286
Fire!

540
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,892
Loose torpedo number two.

541
01:00:04,993 --> 01:00:06,361
Loose torpedo number two.

542
01:00:06,461 --> 01:00:07,662
- Fire!
- Fire!

543
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:12,734
Ready tubes three and four.

544
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:13,901
Ready tubes three and four.

545
01:00:21,275 --> 01:00:22,677
1,000 meters.

546
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,315
800 meters,

547
01:00:33,788 --> 01:00:34,622
400 meters,

548
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:39,193
300 meters.

549
01:00:56,344 --> 01:00:57,378
200.

550
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:07,755
100 meters.

551
01:01:20,702 --> 01:01:21,703
Impact, now.

552
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:27,709
Hit on one.

553
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:35,683
Hit on two.

554
01:01:41,856 --> 01:01:43,391
What are the Americans doing?

555
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,493
The ships are heading
towards the merchant vessel.

556
01:01:46,928 --> 01:01:47,762
On our starboard.

557
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:55,737
We can't let them spot us. Go.

558
01:02:02,077 --> 01:02:03,845
American destroyer
is still approaching.

559
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:10,785
We will hit her.
Periscope depth.

560
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:14,689
Yes, sir.
Periscope depth!

561
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:16,691
Periscope depth.
Ollie, two degrees.

562
01:02:23,098 --> 01:02:25,533
Mark right,
two knots. Full rudder.

563
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:26,567
Yes, sir.

564
01:02:27,735 --> 01:02:29,604
Mark right two knots,
full rudder.

565
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,475
Loose torpedo number three.

566
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,544
<i>Fire number three.</i>

567
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,449
Loose torpedo number four.

568
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:43,684
<i>Fire number four.</i>

569
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:57,832
It should have hit by now.

570
01:02:58,966 --> 01:02:59,967
We still have one more.

571
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,327
- Ah, hit on four!
- Hit on four!

572
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,997
Take it down to
150 meters, four knots.

573
01:03:30,731 --> 01:03:31,766
Now we run.

574
01:03:42,844 --> 01:03:45,012
Any news from the 10th?

575
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,747
A merchant vessel
was in the vicinity when they arrived.

576
01:03:46,848 --> 01:03:48,482
What else?

577
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,718
One of our destroyers,
The Cole, was hit and sunk.

578
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:53,121
The 10th is
conducting rescue operations.

579
01:03:55,556 --> 01:03:58,126
Tomorrow morning, New York
may wake up to German rockets.

580
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:02,930
I want you to move the entire
southern force to the New York Harbor.

581
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:04,832
Can't take any chances.

582
01:04:04,932 --> 01:04:09,704
Haskell, I want the U-boat
found, no more mistakes.

583
01:04:10,872 --> 01:04:11,906
Yes, sir.

584
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:38,733
Make sure this goes to command.

585
01:04:39,934 --> 01:04:40,968
Yes, sir.

586
01:04:48,743 --> 01:04:50,745
<i>The attack
did not take the Germans</i>

587
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,748
<i>by surprise since they had
observed the preparations files</i>

588
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:57,085
<i>for a long time. Generalized
Eisenhower's communique</i>

589
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,654
<i>today said that
the Allied forces attacking</i>

590
01:04:59,754 --> 01:05:01,889
<i>in the</i>

591
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:03,791
<i>established bridgeheads
over the northern</i>

592
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:05,993
<i>and western canals.</i>

593
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,608
It is a message from Kessler.

594
01:06:08,123 --> 01:06:09,757
He's almost upon New York.

595
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:12,260
Does he know?

596
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:14,129
If he doesn't,
he will soon enough.

597
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:19,101
How did you choose a man
like Kessler for this mission?

598
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:22,536
Kessler has lost everything.

599
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:28,176
What better for
command than a man

600
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,710
that does not
have anything to lose?

601
01:06:31,812 --> 01:06:32,646
Heil Hitler.

602
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,941
Sir, we're here.

603
01:07:01,043 --> 01:07:02,009
New York.

604
01:07:03,245 --> 01:07:06,814
Lieutenant Lutz, you've done
a fine job on this mission.

605
01:07:06,914 --> 01:07:07,715
Fine job, indeed.

606
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,153
Thank you, sir.

607
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:31,872
Should be
quite a sight up there.

608
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:34,276
New York City.

609
01:07:36,144 --> 01:07:38,113
Permission to proceed up top?

610
01:07:38,213 --> 01:07:39,214
Permission granted.

611
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,174
This warrants the occasion.

612
01:08:09,478 --> 01:08:11,011
I've never seen such a thing.

613
01:08:12,913 --> 01:08:14,116
Hard to describe.

614
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:16,784
You have seen before?

615
01:08:19,254 --> 01:08:20,222
The beginning of the war.

616
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:25,227
Did we ever
have a chance to win?

617
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,927
No.

618
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,697
We follow our orders.

619
01:08:33,268 --> 01:08:35,303
Hey Reinhart, hang on to this.

620
01:08:36,971 --> 01:08:38,106
Yes, sir.

621
01:08:38,206 --> 01:08:39,707
<i>Has been canceled</i>

622
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,144
<i>in order to bring you
reports from overseas.</i>

623
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:44,945
<i>We have just heard the news
here over our monitoring service</i>

624
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:46,914
<i>that Adolf Hitler is dead.</i>

625
01:08:48,116 --> 01:08:49,084
<i>The announcement came in
an official communique...</i>

626
01:08:49,184 --> 01:08:50,252
Let's get below.

627
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:57,791
The American radios...

628
01:08:57,892 --> 01:08:58,692
For your eyes only.

629
01:09:05,066 --> 01:09:08,436
Admiral Donitz, general
orders to stand down.

630
01:09:09,237 --> 01:09:10,438
Await further instructions.

631
01:09:15,177 --> 01:09:17,279
- Does the crew know?
- Not yet.

632
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:19,381
Is it true?

633
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:21,049
- Hitler dead?
- Must be true.

634
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,353
- Propaganda.
- American propaganda is not like our propaganda.

635
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,189
What do we do?

636
01:09:34,162 --> 01:09:36,198
Have the men
assemble the rocket.

637
01:09:36,431 --> 01:09:37,932
But the Admiral, he said...

638
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:40,068
Hold and await
further instructions.

639
01:09:40,168 --> 01:09:42,304
We may only get one
chance. I want to be ready.

640
01:09:43,837 --> 01:09:45,440
If we work the men in shifts,
we can assemble it faster.

641
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,142
I will see it is done.

642
01:09:48,008 --> 01:09:50,045
This is our chance.
We will be ready.

643
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:50,911
Yes, sir.

644
01:09:54,382 --> 01:09:56,084
This is the captain, hear this.

645
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,054
We're at the gates of our enemy.

646
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:02,224
We will prepare to attack.

647
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,065
Oh, thanks.

648
01:10:11,799 --> 01:10:13,435
Nights like these,
we can all use a cup.

649
01:10:17,972 --> 01:10:18,806
What is it?

650
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,175
Hitler is dead.

651
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:21,875
Just announced.

652
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:29,883
War is done.

653
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,288
- Sir?
- Yeah?

654
01:10:33,555 --> 01:10:34,389
Kessler.

655
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,325
What about him?

656
01:10:37,425 --> 01:10:40,128
His file indicates he lost his
family in the Dresden fire bombings.

657
01:10:40,228 --> 01:10:41,529
All of them?

658
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:42,896
Yes.

659
01:10:44,566 --> 01:10:45,500
Got nothing to lose.

660
01:10:47,269 --> 01:10:49,304
He doesn't care about Hitler.
Put the 10th on high alert.

661
01:10:49,404 --> 01:10:50,372
Sir.

662
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,441
I miss you.

663
01:11:37,385 --> 01:11:41,222
Sir, she is ready.

664
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,559
See the fine work
you've done, Lieutenant.

665
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:01,008
Attention!

666
01:12:03,977 --> 01:12:07,848
Men, each one of
you should be proud

667
01:12:09,184 --> 01:12:10,452
to call yourself German.

668
01:12:13,355 --> 01:12:15,223
You're all true Kriegsmarine.

669
01:12:17,392 --> 01:12:21,596
Sir, we have contact at 8573.

670
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:25,567
- Merchant?
- American Navy.

671
01:12:25,667 --> 01:12:26,867
Sir, they found us.

672
01:12:33,108 --> 01:12:34,542
Can we fire
the rocket from here?

673
01:12:35,443 --> 01:12:38,079
We need to get closer to
the shore to fire the rocket.

674
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:39,347
We're still too far away.

675
01:12:46,688 --> 01:12:48,523
Sir, your orders?

676
01:13:09,043 --> 01:13:11,011
Sir, we have contact.

677
01:13:11,112 --> 01:13:12,680
- Is it her?
- Yes, sir.

678
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:14,582
Sound general quarters.

679
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,285
General
quarters, general quarters.

680
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:24,659
Men.

681
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,960
Hitler is dead.

682
01:13:30,765 --> 01:13:32,467
We have two options.

683
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:37,138
Surrender or fight.

684
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:48,949
We are with you, sir.

685
01:13:57,325 --> 01:13:58,359
We fight.

686
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,009
Helmsman,
take the boat 93 degrees,

687
01:14:16,444 --> 01:14:17,579
six knots.

688
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,012
Yes, sir.

689
01:14:19,347 --> 01:14:21,282
- Battle stations.
- Battle stations!

690
01:14:21,382 --> 01:14:22,450
Battle stations!

691
01:14:35,797 --> 01:14:38,166
Sir, they made contact.

692
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:41,302
- They found her?
- Latest reports had them closing in on her position.

693
01:14:41,402 --> 01:14:42,170
Just a matter of time.

694
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:46,107
Checkmate. Checkmate!

695
01:14:50,411 --> 01:14:52,313
Sir, the signal's
getting stronger.

696
01:14:53,548 --> 01:14:54,382
It's getting closer?

697
01:14:55,183 --> 01:14:56,484
Sir, it's coming straight at us.

698
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,428
On this course, we are
going straight into warships.

699
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:09,464
Prepare to dive.

700
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:10,331
Prepare to dive!

701
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,402
Keep on this course
through the shallows.

702
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:18,339
Sir, on this course
we will split them.

703
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:24,145
They cannot fire their depth
charges so close to their own boats.

704
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,582
Increase speed, eight knots.

705
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,118
Yes, sir.
Increase speed.

706
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:31,653
Increase speed, eight knots.

707
01:15:37,692 --> 01:15:39,193
- You find her?
- No.

708
01:15:40,562 --> 01:15:41,796
It appears to be attacking.

709
01:15:42,864 --> 01:15:44,299
What? How?

710
01:15:58,813 --> 01:16:01,249
Captain, the U-boat's
coming up alongside us, sir.

711
01:16:03,451 --> 01:16:04,552
Get on the surface guns.

712
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:06,521
Yes, sir.

713
01:16:06,621 --> 01:16:07,722
You heard him, get on the
surface guns, let's go.

714
01:16:26,641 --> 01:16:28,476
Captain,
the guns aren't long enough.

715
01:16:29,811 --> 01:16:32,146
Sir, she's going to get away.

716
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:34,382
I don't think so.

717
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:40,388
Sir, we are clear.

718
01:16:45,326 --> 01:16:48,262
Sir, there are
more ships on the sonar.

719
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:03,611
Captain, the rest of
the 10th has arrived.

720
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:05,880
Right on cue.

721
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:08,249
How much closer?

722
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,884
We should be in range.

723
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:12,153
We take
our chances on the surface.

724
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,321
Blow the ballast.

725
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,756
Yes, sir.
Blow the ballast!

726
01:17:14,856 --> 01:17:15,623
Blow the ballast!

727
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:34,342
Captain, the sub.
It has surfaced.

728
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,244
What? Attacking?

729
01:17:36,344 --> 01:17:36,911
Come see.

730
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,218
Is it attacking?

731
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:47,288
I think it's about to fire.

732
01:17:47,388 --> 01:17:47,955
Fire what?

733
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:49,524
It's a rocket.

734
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:54,295
All due respect, sir, I wanna
see my mom again after this war.

735
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:57,365
I'll get you home
to your mother.

736
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,484
Sir.

737
01:18:28,796 --> 01:18:32,734
General orders to all
U-boats, cease operations.

738
01:18:33,901 --> 01:18:36,337
Stand down, stand down.

739
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:40,775
We are too late.

740
01:18:48,883 --> 01:18:50,785
Sir, the sub has surfaced.

741
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:52,787
The 10th is waiting
for your orders.

742
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:55,590
What do you wanna do?

743
01:18:58,860 --> 01:18:59,927
Blow it out of the water.

744
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,462
Sir. Sir,
we have to abandon ship.

745
01:20:08,663 --> 01:20:09,797
Get the men out.

746
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:12,433
Captain.

747
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,835
Come on, Captain.

748
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,874
Captain goes down with his ship.

749
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:22,510
It's my duty.

750
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:27,548
Now go. Go!

751
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:33,921
Thank you, sir.

752
01:21:44,725 --> 01:21:46,627
<i>A captain with a sense of honor</i>

753
01:21:47,728 --> 01:21:49,897
<i>cannot separate his fate
from that of his ship.</i>

754
01:21:52,234 --> 01:21:53,935
<i>I can only prove by my own death</i>

755
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:58,206
<i>that the fighting
services of Germany</i>

756
01:21:58,307 --> 01:21:59,974
<i>were ready to die for the flag.</i>

757
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:03,644
<i>You're a young man, Reinhart,</i>

758
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:07,915

759
01:22:09,984 --> 01:22:11,053
<i>Like I told you once before,</i>

760
01:22:13,155 --> 01:22:17,525
