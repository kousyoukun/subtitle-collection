00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:03,965
You are my second in command,

310
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,601
you must obey all my
orders without question.

311
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,468
Is that clear?

312
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:08,903
Yes, Captain.

313
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:12,340
On this boat, we all
have a duty to perform.

314
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,044
Under my command, what matters
is the defeat of the enemy,

315
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:19,047
the lives of the crew, and
the safety of this boat.

316
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,315
Understood?

317
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:23,551
Yes, sir.

318
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:24,852
Good.

319
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:25,820
Now what's your report?

320
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:28,956
U-894 is falling behind.

321
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,326
Why is he falling behind?

322
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,594
Engine trouble.

323
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:39,867
Radio U-578, let him know.

324
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,069
Yes, sir.

325
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,637
Keep her sturdy and on course.

326
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,940
We have to make up for
any time we might lose.

327
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:48,009
Yes, Captain.

343
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:23,404
Settled into my quarters.

344
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,045
The whole crew is on your side.

345
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:32,747

347
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:44,059
Get the diesels up and running.

348
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,593
Send reports every 20 minutes.

350

- Heil Hitler.

Sir, she's going to get away.

935
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:34,382
I don't think so.

936
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:40,388
Sir, we are clear.

Sir, there are
more ships on the sonar.

940
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:03,611
Captain, the rest of
the 10th has arrived.

941
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:05,880
Right on cue.

942
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:08,249
How much closer?

943
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,884
We should be in range.

944
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:12,153
We take
our chances on the surface.

945
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,321
Blow the ballast.

946

Blow the ballast!

949
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:34,342
Captain, the sub.
It has surfaced.

950
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,244
What? Attacking?

951
01:17:36,344 --> 01:17:36,911
Come see.

<font color="#00CDCD">(intense music)</font>

953
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,218
Is it attacking?

954
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:47,288
I think it's about to fire.

955
01:17:47,388 --> 01:17:47,955
Fire what?

956
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:49,524
It's a rocket.

957
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:54,295
All due respect, sir, I wanna
see my mom again after this war.

958
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:57,365
I'll get you home
to your mother.

Sir, the sub has surfaced.

The 10th is waiting
for your orders.

What do you wanna do?

968
01:18:58,860 --> 01:18:59,927
Blow it out of the water.

Get the men out.
