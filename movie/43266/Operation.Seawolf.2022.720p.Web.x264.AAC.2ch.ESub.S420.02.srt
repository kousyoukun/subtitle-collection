There it is.
It's ready for firing.

Happy hunting.

Good job, Hans.

Remember your training,
it will serve you well.

12

Alarm!

13

Fire at will!

17

45 seconds for impact.

Yes.

Pegged to command his wolf pack.

Please.

Yes, sir.

82
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,547
What are my orders, Commander?

83
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:48,816
Why am I here?

84
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:51,053
Straight to the point.

85
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:55,656
It is no secret, the U-boats
have been performing poorly.

86
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,458
The British and the Americans

87
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:00,761
have made
it a priority to hunt us down.

88
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:01,996
The Fuhrer has not been pleased.

89
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,933
The Fuhrer needed more boats,

90
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,501
ask to bring in the others.

91
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,004
Let me show you something.

92
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:22,550
You see this?

93
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:27,855
It's the American coast.

94
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:30,691
New York City, the heart
of the American war effort.

95
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:32,660
Operation Sea Wolf.

96
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,899
We tried these operations,
we have failed.

97
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:48,076
V-1 rocket,
Hitler's wonder weapon.

98
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,049
We shall equip these
rockets to our U-boats

99
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,917
and attack the American coast.

100
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,189
Our fleets will strike fear
into the heart of the enemy.

101
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:03,958
You will lead the pack.

102
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,501
At the beginning of the war,

103
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:17,939
our pack ruled the waves,
steel, blood, fire, fear.

104
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,642
These were our thoughts.

105
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:24,779
Now we have our dreams
of one of our person,

106
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,748
victory is out of our grasp.

107
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,455
The Fuhrer has spared no
expense for this operation.

108
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,226
No expense.

109
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:39,961
None.

110
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,001
A pack needs wolves.

111
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,074
Let me show you some wolves.

112
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,750
Attention.

113
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:11,993
Your wolves.

114
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:29,111
These are not wolves but boys.

115
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,181
Young boys.

116
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,283
Were you and
I much different from them?

117
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:36,984
When the war started,

118
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:40,188
I spent nine months with my
men before going into action.

119
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,860
They have had the finest
training Germany has to offer.

120
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:49,131
Do they know what the risks are?

121
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:50,998
They know the risks.

122
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:54,835
They are ready to die
for country and Fuhrer.

123
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:08,050
These are not Kriegsmarine.

124
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:12,187
Then teach them Kriegsmarine.

125
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:12,247
I will do it.

126
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,327
Operation Sea Wolf.

127
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:30,831
You will leave with three ships.

128
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:33,135
Seven more will join you
when you are out to sea.

129
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:38,806
10 boats.

130
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:42,977
You will be the spear
point for more to follow.

131
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:50,418
And I'll see our targets?

132
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,920
Allied shipping lanes,
north of New York.

133
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,821
The missile attack?

134
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:55,123
New York City.

135
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,294
Departure?

136
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,829
The crews await your word.

137
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:06,434
I believe I'd first,

138
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:11,306
I like to meet my
officers and see the boat.

139
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,108
I would expect nothing less.

140
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:23,017
The officers of U-546.

141
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,391
You, Lieutenant.

142
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,092
Lieutenant Erich Reinhart, sir.

143
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,128
Acting captain of U-546.

144
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:34,828
Captain?

145
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:38,832
Reinhart was
in line to be captain,

146
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,835
but under your leadership
he was glad to step aside.

147
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:45,073
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

148
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,078
I'm looking forward to
serving under your command.

149
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:52,880
The boat?

150
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,115
Lieutenant Lutz.

151
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,783

- Engines are ready, sir.

152
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,288

153
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:01,722
The crew is in high morale, sir.

154
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:05,227
Good, good.

155
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:13,201
Good. Let's go inspect
my boat and get some food.

156
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:29,517
Sea Wolf.

157
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:33,221
Let the Commander know
I need to see him now.

158
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:34,289
Yes, sir.

159
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:48,436
Commander?

160
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,903
Come in.

161
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,474
Operation Sea Wolf is a go.

162
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,077
Confirmed?

163
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,079
Just came over
the wires, confirmed by Enigma.

164
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:00,482
War room.

165
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,017
- We got our work to do.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:25,066
Morning, sir.

176
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:29,204
Well, Heinrich.

177
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,071
The time has come.

178
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:34,109
The ghosts stay here in port.

179
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:37,512
It's now just you,
the crew, and the mission.

180
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:39,481
Are you prepared?

181
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:46,421
If the crew is half as good
as the boats, I'm confident

182
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:51,526
under the circumstances.

183
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:54,129
There it is then.

184
00:22:56,598 --> 00:23:01,536
I leave you to your second
home, the sea and the ship.

185
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:05,507
Good luck, my friend.

186
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,310
Good luck to you.

187
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:29,097
Attention.

188
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:48,349
At ease.

189
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,458
I know you do not know me.

190
00:23:58,293 --> 00:23:59,127
I do not know you.

191
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:06,067
The men of the sea are
a special brotherhood,

192
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,603
a bond forged out of the ocean.

193
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:13,608
A U-boat's
crew is life, the blood.

194
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:18,446
Our worth will be measured
to surface of the sea.

195
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:23,485
I know each one of
you will do your duty.

196
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:27,188
I will not disappoint you.

197
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:32,093
Do not disappoint me.

198
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:36,064
All hands to stations.

199
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:37,332
You heard the Captain.

200
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,466
All hands to stations.

201
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:45,406
Take her out, engine six
knots, starboard 108 degrees.

202
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:48,076
Yes Captain, Lutz.

203
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:52,480
Ollie, engine six knots,
starboard 108 degrees.

204
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:14,702
Captain, the boat
is sailing at six knots.

205
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:16,804
Diesels are running
smoothly, batteries charged.

206
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:19,707
Good. Take her down
to periscope depth.

207
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:22,277
Want her under the surface.

208
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:25,113
Yes, Captain.

209
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,481
Periscope depth.

210
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:27,549
Periscope depth.

211
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,198
Intelligence has
indicated the U-boat pack

212
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:45,600
has left their pens at Trondheim

213
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,535
and are making for open ocean.

214
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:49,671
They'll drop down into
the Northern fishing lanes.

215
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:51,339
They'll hide in and out of them.

216
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,608
They will be using snorkels,
it's hard to track.

217
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,376
Yeah, they'll be going slow.

218
00:25:55,476 --> 00:25:57,278
Give us a chance to get
into position and intercept.

219
00:25:57,545 --> 00:25:59,847
The 10th fleet is ready with
escort carriers and destroyers.

220
00:25:59,948 --> 00:26:01,583
Okay, contact Commander Emmetts.

221
00:26:01,683 --> 00:26:05,186
Split his forces, half
goes north, half south.

222
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:06,588
I don't wanna take any chances.

223
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,191
Nothing better than a wolf hunt.

224
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:11,593
No, sir.

225
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:36,096

Port four degrees,

227
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:58,640
- Keep her steady.
- Aye aye, sir.

228

Port four degrees,
right turn rudder.

229
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,678
Captain, orders from Emmetts.

230
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:06,648
Yes, sir?

231
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:10,551
Thank you, sir.

232
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:14,489
Starboard,
right runner, 10 knots.

233
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,523
Changing course.

234
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:18,693
Operation Teardrop is a go.

235
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,262
They're really going
to let us hunt subs?

236
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:22,363
Oh, we are in the hunt.

237
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:24,265
Yes, sir.

238
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,435
- Helmsman?
- Aye aye, sir.

239
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,032
Don't be like that, you wimp.

240
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,536
- Do you guys have anything for me?
- No, shut up.

241
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,373
What I'd give for a good beer right now.

242
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,625
Are you ready for battle,
my fellow soldiers?

243
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,044
- Yes.
- We will defeat them.

244
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,630
I have a bag of potatoes here.

245
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,550
And I also have chocolate.

246
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:56,468
- No, no.
- Great.

247
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,612
- All right?
- Yes, well done.

248
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,530
Yes.

249
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,500
Apologies, Captain.

250
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,569
I haven't had a chance
to finish cleaning out

251
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:35,636
my personal belongings.

252
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:38,239
Hitler youth.

253
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,612
His blood, his honor.
It was my brother's.

254
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,549
He was killed in
Normandy by Americans.

255
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:54,522
I'm sorry to
hear that, Lieutenant.

256
00:28:58,426 --> 00:28:59,894
Now, I understand
I'm taking your command

257
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:01,763
of this boat away.

258
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:03,965
You are my second in command,

259
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,601
you must obey all my
orders without question.

260
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,468
Is that clear?

261
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:08,903
Yes, Captain.

262
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:12,340
On this boat, we all
have a duty to perform.

263
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,044
Under my command, what matters
is the defeat of the enemy,

264
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:19,047
the lives of the crew, and
the safety of this boat.

265
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,315
Understood?

266
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:23,551
Yes, sir.

267
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:24,852
Good.

268
00:29:24,952 --> 00:29:25,820
Now what's your report?

269
00:29:27,588 --> 00:29:28,956
U-894 is falling behind.

270
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,326
Why is he falling behind?

271
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,594
Engine trouble.

272
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:39,867
Radio U-578, let him know.

273
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,069
Yes, sir.

274
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,637
Keep her sturdy and on course.

275
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,940
We have to make up for
any time we might lose.

276
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:48,009
Yes, Captain.

277
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,850
- Sleeping little boy?
- Sleeping.

278
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:02,817
Do you plan on using that?

279
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:04,986
What?

280
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:05,920
I hope not on me.

281
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:08,090
Don't tempt me.

282
00:31:08,522 --> 00:31:10,024
I never got my knife.

283
00:31:11,893 --> 00:31:13,561
My family couldn't afford it.

284
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:15,863
Didn't have enough money.

285
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,035
How is our new Captain?

286
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:23,404
Settled into my quarters.

287
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,045
The whole crew is on your side.

288
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:32,747
Men like Kessler,

289
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:36,617
their time has passed.

290
00:31:42,257 --> 00:31:44,059
Get the diesels up and running.

291
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,593
Send reports every 20 minutes.

292
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,462
Captain's orders.

293
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:50,698
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

294
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:51,732
Heil Hitler.

295
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,672
Helmsman.

296
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,573
Right rudder, 20 degrees.

297
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,575
Maintaining current course.

298
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:03,577
Sir, we have sonar contact.

299
00:32:03,678 --> 00:32:05,579
- Ships on the surface?
- I think so, sir.

300
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:08,083
What is it?

301
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:09,217
Contact with the enemy.

302
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:11,086
Do you have the boats confirmed?

303
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,554
Reinhart, check.

304
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,589
Yes, sir.

305
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,724
Should I get the captain?

306
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,459
Not yet.

307
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:23,564
Reinhart, report!

308
00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:26,567
Sir, multiple
ships coming in fast.

309
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,785
The other U-boats
were reporting the same.

310
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:45,953
I have visual contact.

311
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:48,923
- Convoy?
- Yes.

312
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:52,560
U-578 is asking to engage.

313
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:54,628
What should we tell them?

314
00:32:56,964 --> 00:32:58,133
This could be our first kill.

315
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:00,168
We can't give that order.

316
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,037
We need the captain.

317
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:06,174
Give the order to engage.

318
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:08,976
Yes, sir.

319
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:13,948
Now get the Captain.

320
00:33:16,884 --> 00:33:17,718
Yes, sir.

321
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,633
Why have the diesels stopped?

322
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:36,138
Captain, enemy contact,
convoy merchant vessels,

323
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:38,005
U-578 has started to engage.

324
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:39,174
Who gave that order?

325
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:41,575
Torpedoes in the water!

326
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,078
Captain, torpedoes in the water.

327
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:45,946
Up periscope, move.

328
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:47,548
Up periscope!

329
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:14,842
It's a hit.

330
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:16,644
It's a hit.

331
00:34:28,256 --> 00:34:30,991
Another hit. Another hit.

332
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:36,597
Ready the torpedoes.

333
00:34:38,433 --> 00:34:40,901
I will call off the ranges.
Battle stations.

334
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:45,073
Battle stations!

335
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,343
Battle stations,
battle stations,

336
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,345
battle stations,
battle stations!

337
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:09,897
Sir, a convoy was just hit.
Looks like U-Boats.

338
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:11,799
- Where?
- Grid section 473.

339
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,404
That's our pack. Launch
all the birds from Greely.

340
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,406
I want all
available forces on that spot.

341
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,975
- I'll inform the 10th.
- I need all eyes out there.

342
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:22,410
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

343
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:50,838
The snorkel is
giving us trouble.

344
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,441
It'd be better if
we get to the surface.

345
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,775
Damaged?

346
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,744
Hard to tell unless
we get to the surface.

347
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:58,746
Call the engine room.

348
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:08,056
- Yeah?
- The electric motor's charging?

349
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:09,890
Not sufficiently.

350
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,126
The diesels?

351
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:12,460
Might be best to
do a surface check.

352
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:14,462
Right.

353
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:19,967
What's going on?

354
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:21,835
Batteries are
not fully charging.

355
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:24,239
We need to go to the surface
and check the snorkel.

356
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:25,739
Take it to the surface.

357
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,708
Radio?

358
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,277
Inform the other
boats we are surfacing

359
00:36:29,377 --> 00:36:30,811
for a maintenance check.

360
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:31,912
Yes, sir.

361
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:34,249
Rouse the deck crew!

362
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,885
Take us to the surface.

363
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:38,953
Yes, sir.

364
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:19,060
Where's the Captain?

365
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:21,829
Passed out again.

366
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,166
Keep her steady.

367
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,235
I don't need
anybody going overboard.

368
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:38,079
We have an issue.

369
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:42,983
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

370
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:46,787
What is going on?

371
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,426
Get the machine guns
from the weapons rack.

372
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:54,928
Weapons!

373
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,474
Survivors?

374
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,444
It's not clear.

375
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:12,314
We can't take on survivors.

376
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:16,418
Ready the deck guns,

377
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:19,154
we can't take any chances.

378
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:20,455
Won't the Captain notice?

379
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,924
He will think he gave the order.

380
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:24,992
Right.

381
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:36,438
Is that a deck gun?

382
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:38,273
- Yes, sir.
- Who are they shooting at?

383
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:39,873
We spotted lifeboats.

384
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:41,476
I thought it best
to leave no survivors.

385
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:43,345
I did not give that order.

386
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,047
Can't the survivors
give away our location?

387
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:48,450
Idiot.
We could be spotted.

388
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:50,851
Sir, who could see us out here?

389
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:52,120
Aircraft.

390
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,456
Get the men below. Now, go.

391
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,215
All hands to battle stations.

392
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:21,349
Prepare the ship to dive.

393
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:26,388
Inform the other submarines
of evasive action.

394
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:33,994
Engine room,
95% to both engines.

395
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:34,662
Now.

396
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:46,508
There!

397
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:49,677
Quickly.

398
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,574
They're coming!

399
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,101
What is going on?

400
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:14,469
We're under air attack.

401
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,620
Fire at will!

402
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,046
Get up, we don't have much time.

403
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,455
Speer.

404
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:36,990
Speer!

405
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,073
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

406
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:59,481
Pull the ballast.
We need to dive, now.

407
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:01,716
Prepare to dive.
Close the ballast.

408
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:07,322
They are coming in
for the another attack.

409
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:08,423
Where's the others?

410
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:09,624
They are dead.

411
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:11,956
Sir, we can...

412
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,395
You put the life of this
crew and this boat in danger.

413
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:17,465
Lieutenant Lutz,
confine Lieutenant Reinhart

414
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:19,133
to the mess
quarters under guard.

415
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:22,002
- Sir.
- You must decide whose orders you follow.

416
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:27,475
Dive. Dive!

417
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,601
Sir, Navy planes
have engaged the sub.

418
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:58,540
- What's the location?
- Grid section 9-47-4.

419
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:09,150
Get the fleet to make
for grid section 1455.

420
00:42:10,752 --> 00:42:12,620
- This could be our break. Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

421
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,143
Left full rudder.

422
00:42:35,243 --> 00:42:36,644
- Left full rudder.
- Yes, sir.

423
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:40,381
Sir, U-578 has
made sonar contact

424
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:41,749
with ships on the surface.

425
00:42:43,718 --> 00:42:45,286
Up periscope.

426
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,821
- Yes, sir.
- Up periscope.

427
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:03,438
Periscope depth, sir.

428
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,336
Take it down to 50 meters.

429
00:43:35,436 --> 00:43:36,404
Sir?

430
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:40,408
American destroyers, carriers.

431
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:41,476
50 meters, sir.

432
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,618
Ollie.

433
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:52,420
- Up five, down 10.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:43:59,794 --> 00:44:02,797
Now hear this,
this is the Captain.

435
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,901
We made surface
contact with enemy ships.

436
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:10,271
<font color="#32D838"><i>We'll</i></font>
<font color="#32D838"><i>the ships head on.</i></font>

437
00:44:11,939 --> 00:44:12,840
We're underneath them.

438
00:44:13,975 --> 00:44:16,844
<font color="#32D838"><i>Close enough for
the sonar not to pick up.</i></font>

439
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,715
With any luck,

440
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:22,316
we'll pass unnoticed.

441
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:40,368
Keep on the present course.

442
00:44:40,468 --> 00:44:41,235
Yes, sir.

443
00:44:43,271 --> 00:44:46,474
We should be under the boats,
in the clear, seven minutes.

444
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:48,943
Seven minutes?

445
00:44:51,345 --> 00:44:52,480
Set.

446
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,894
Sir.

447
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:07,895
Something on sonar.

448
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:11,632
Have the jersey
bear 20 degrees port.

449
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:13,568
Aye, sir.

450
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:15,403
Wait for my orders and then
proceed to drop depth charges.

451
00:45:15,937 --> 00:45:18,372
Port 15 degrees, half speed.

452
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:19,540
Right standard rudder.

453
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,808
Aye aye, sir.

454
00:45:51,706 --> 00:45:52,740
Four minutes.

455
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:55,643
There you go, sir.

456
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:56,911
Thank you.

457
00:45:59,814 --> 00:46:02,884
Sir, contact bearing
two niner five port side.

458
00:46:02,984 --> 00:46:04,619
- Go for jersey.
- Yes, sir.

459
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:05,987
- Drop depth charges.
- Aye, sir.

460
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:25,673
Two minutes.

461
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:49,864
Come on, come on.

462
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:57,805
Launch hedgehogs!

463
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,858
Sir?

464
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,994
Oil slick on the water.

465
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:56,697
We got 'em!

466
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,880
The 10th is reporting contact
and taking men in a sub.

467
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:15,050
- Just one?
- For now.

468
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:17,085
It's a pack!

469
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,855
- There's more than one.
- Right, sir.

470
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:22,957
Tell them to keep hunting. Go.

471
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:39,573
We are safe.

472
00:48:44,146 --> 00:48:47,049
Sir, we've lost
contact with U-578.

473
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:49,650
Nothing but static.

474
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:57,959
We continue.
We have our orders.

475
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,760
Keep her steady, six knots.

476
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:02,197
We surface at nightfall.

477
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:03,664
Yes, sir.

478
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:26,188
The captain needs small arms.

479
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:28,656
Two machine pistols.

480
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:30,524
I'm going to need to confirm.

481
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:52,114
Sir.

482
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:55,117
The 10th has lost sonar contact.

483
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:58,552
They are sweeping the area, but
so far, no new developments.

484
00:49:58,652 --> 00:50:00,155
If there were more boats,
they got away.

485
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,161
Keep 'em sweeping
back towards the coast.

486
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:08,929
Contact the Coast Guard
and double their patrols.

487
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:09,964
Keep their eyes open.

488
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:11,033
Yes, sir.

489
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:28,150
Sergeant.

490
00:50:29,683 --> 00:50:32,920
Let them know we have to
join the other U-boats.

491
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,943
Yes, sir.

492
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:36,291
Attack on the United
States coast is imminent.

493
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:37,259
Yes, sir.

494
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,094
Sir.

495
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,861
We have a problem.

496
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,330
What?

497
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:43,831
It's Lieutenant Reinhart.

498
00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:00,614
Stay back.

499
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:15,963
Reinhart.

500
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:35,150
Stay back!

501
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:41,289
Lieutenant,
hand that pistol over.

502
00:51:42,157 --> 00:51:43,657
We'll forget
about this incident.

503
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:48,796
I got those men killed.

504
00:51:50,298 --> 00:51:51,799
They are dead because of me.

505
00:51:54,035 --> 00:51:55,070
I failed my ship.

506
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:59,241
I failed the crew,
and I failed you.

507
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,311
Your failure, with thanks
to my poor leadership.

508
00:52:04,212 --> 00:52:05,946
Hand the pistol over.

509
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:07,415
I said stay back!

510
00:52:14,156 --> 00:52:15,257
During the Great War,

511
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:21,096
a new branch of service,
U-boat, became available.

512
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:24,199
Many of my peers volunteered.

513
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,102
Few were chosen.

514
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:28,303
I was one of the few.

515
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:38,380
My first day at sea,
a man was washed overboard.

516
00:52:39,047 --> 00:52:43,051
I asked the captain to start
a rescue operation, he refused.

517
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:50,392
On a U-boat, every man's
decided his own fate.

518
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,296
Destiny takes control.

519
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:55,896
We cannot look back.

520
00:52:57,065 --> 00:52:57,932
We must look forward.

521
00:53:03,938 --> 00:53:06,274
My duty is to use every man on
this ship to complete our mission.

522
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:08,043
That includes you, Reinhart.

523
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,372
Do not let the mistakes of your
past determine your future.

524
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:53,121
Your watch starts
in five minutes. Go.

525
00:53:58,593 --> 00:53:59,793
Yes, Captain.

526
00:55:42,397 --> 00:55:43,498
We have contact.

527
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,168
We are close to the coast.

528
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:48,036
Yes, sir.

529
00:55:50,003 --> 00:55:52,474
Notify the engine room.
Cut power to the diesels.

530
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:54,509
Yes, sir.

531
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:56,144
Where's Lieutenant Reinhart?

532
00:55:56,378 --> 00:55:57,345
He's on watch.

533
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,049
I'm going up top.

534
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,217
Yes, sir.

535
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:22,036
Cold night.

536
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:24,239
Yes, sir.

537
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,516
If we keep her on our
starboard, she won't notice us.

538
00:56:36,217 --> 00:56:37,252
How?

539
00:56:38,753 --> 00:56:40,388
At night,
the outline of our boat

540
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:41,689
will line up with her stern.

541
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:45,560
A blind spot?

542
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,428
Yes.

543
00:56:48,296 --> 00:56:49,697
Make sure to keep
her on our starboard.

544
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:51,699
Yes, sir.

545
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,571
Wonderful one.

546
00:56:58,239 --> 00:56:59,274
Sir?

547
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:04,279
I was part of the wonderful
youth when I was a boy.

548
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:08,616
I've heard of them, sir.

549
00:57:09,484 --> 00:57:11,052
Good, carry on Lieutenant.

550
00:57:11,152 --> 00:57:11,719
Yes, sir.

551
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:17,192
Word from
the 10th fleet in the south.

552
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:18,560
They have just
sunk three U-boats.

553
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:20,728
What about the north?

554
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:22,664
- Nothing yet, sir.
- Nothing.

555
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,065
Don't like it.

556
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,067
One could sneak through.

557
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:29,103
They'll be
closing in. We will find them.

558
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,122
Sir,
engines are performing 100%.

559
00:57:48,223 --> 00:57:50,225
We should be upon
New York Harbor in a day.

560
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:51,992
Have we heard
from the other U-boats?

561
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:52,660
No, sir.

562
00:57:55,163 --> 00:57:58,366
How long would it take to
ready us to launch the attack?

563
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:01,669
Should take five, six hours
to load the missile on deck.

564
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:05,473
We don't have
time to make mistakes.

565
00:58:05,573 --> 00:58:07,175
We can't make mistakes, sir.

566
00:58:08,543 --> 00:58:10,044
Ships
on the horizon, captain.

567
00:58:11,346 --> 00:58:12,480
Merchant?

568
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,681
They look like Navy ships.

569
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:17,585
Sir, I have multiple
contacts on the sonar.

570
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,053
They're coming in fast.

571
00:58:22,357 --> 00:58:23,258
Battle stations.

572
00:58:23,558 --> 00:58:25,126
Battle stations!

573
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:35,370
Ships on our starboard and port.

574
00:58:42,377 --> 00:58:43,778
American warships.

575
00:58:43,878 --> 00:58:45,547
- Have they spotted us?
- Not yet.

576
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,515
Could at any minute.

577
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:54,255
Load the torpedoes, the
target is the merchant ship.

578
00:58:54,355 --> 00:58:57,158
- We are going to attack?
- Yes, Lieutenant, now go.

579
00:58:57,258 --> 00:58:57,825
Yes, sir.

580
00:59:40,902 --> 00:59:42,737
Torpedoes
await your command, sir.

581
00:59:43,771 --> 00:59:44,839
Port 90 degrees.

582
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:47,175
Port 90 degrees.

583
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:48,309
Port 90 degrees, sir.

584
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,717
Loose torpedo number one.

585
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:58,765
Fire at will!

586
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,892
Loose torpedo number two.

587
01:00:04,993 --> 01:00:06,361
Loose torpedo number two.

588
01:00:06,461 --> 01:00:07,662
- Fire!
- Fire!

589
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:12,734
Ready tubes three and four.

590
01:00:12,834 --> 01:00:13,901
Ready tubes three and four.

591
01:00:21,275 --> 01:00:22,677
1,000 meters.

592
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,315
800 meters,

593
01:00:33,788 --> 01:00:34,622
400 meters,

594
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:39,193
300 meters.

595
01:00:56,344 --> 01:00:57,378
200.

596
01:01:06,721 --> 01:01:07,755
100 meters.

597
01:01:20,702 --> 01:01:21,703
Impact, now.

598
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:27,709
Hit on one.

599
01:01:34,549 --> 01:01:35,683
Hit on two.

600
01:01:41,856 --> 01:01:43,391
What are the Americans doing?

601
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,493
The ships are heading
towards the merchant vessel.

602
01:01:46,928 --> 01:01:47,762
On our starboard.

603
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:55,737
We can't let them spot us. Go.

604
01:02:02,077 --> 01:02:03,845
American destroyer
is still approaching.

605
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:10,785
We will hit her.
Periscope depth.

606
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:14,689
Yes, sir.
Periscope depth!

607
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:16,691
Periscope depth.
Ollie, two degrees.

608
01:02:23,098 --> 01:02:25,533
Mark right,
two knots. Full rudder.

609
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:26,567
Yes, sir.

610
01:02:27,735 --> 01:02:29,604
Mark right two knots,
full rudder.

611
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,475
Loose torpedo number three.

612
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,544
<font color="#32D838"><i>Fire number three.</i></font>

613
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,449
Loose torpedo number four.

614
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:43,684
<font color="#32D838"><i>Fire number four.</i></font>

615
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:57,832
It should have hit by now.

616
01:02:58,966 --> 01:02:59,967
We still have one more.

617
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:26,327
- Ah, hit on four!
- Hit on four!

618
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,997
Take it down to
150 meters, four knots.

619
01:03:30,731 --> 01:03:31,766
Now we run.

620
01:03:42,844 --> 01:03:45,012
Any news from the 10th?

621
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:46,747
A merchant vessel
was in the vicinity when they arrived.

622
01:03:46,848 --> 01:03:48,482
What else?

623
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,718
One of our destroyers,
The Cole, was hit and sunk.

624
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:53,121
The 10th is
conducting rescue operations.

625
01:03:55,556 --> 01:03:58,126
Tomorrow morning, New York
may wake up to German rockets.

626
01:04:00,195 --> 01:04:02,930
I want you to move the entire
southern force to the New York Harbor.

627
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:04,832
Can't take any chances.

628
01:04:04,932 --> 01:04:09,704
Haskell, I want the U-boat
found, no more mistakes.

629
01:04:10,872 --> 01:04:11,906
Yes, sir.

630
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:38,733
Make sure this goes to command.

631
01:04:39,934 --> 01:04:40,968
Yes, sir.

645
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,608
It is a message from Kessler.

646
01:06:08,123 --> 01:06:09,757
He's almost upon New York.

647
01:06:10,825 --> 01:06:12,260
Does he know?

648
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:14,129
If he doesn't,
he will soon enough.

649
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:19,101
How did you choose a man
like Kessler for this mission?

650
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:22,536
Kessler has lost everything.

651
01:06:25,207 --> 01:06:28,176
What better for
command than a man

652
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,710
that does not
have anything to lose?

653
01:06:31,812 --> 01:06:32,646
Heil Hitler.

654
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,941
Sir, we're here.

655
01:07:01,043 --> 01:07:02,009
New York.

656
01:07:03,245 --> 01:07:06,814
Lieutenant Lutz, you've done
a fine job on this mission.

657
01:07:06,914 --> 01:07:07,715
Fine job, indeed.

658
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,153
Thank you, sir.

659
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:31,872
Should be
quite a sight up there.

660
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:34,276
New York City.

661
01:07:36,144 --> 01:07:38,113
Permission to proceed up top?

662
01:07:38,213 --> 01:07:39,214
Permission granted.

663
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,174
This warrants
the occasion.

664
01:08:06,274 --> 01:08:09,377
♪ 'Till the blue skies
ride the dark cloud ♪

665
01:08:09,478 --> 01:08:11,011
I've never seen such a thing.

666
01:08:11,113 --> 01:08:12,813
♪ Far away ♪

667
01:08:12,913 --> 01:08:14,116
Hard to describe.

668
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:16,784
You have seen before?

669
01:08:19,254 --> 01:08:20,222
The beginning of the war.

670
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:25,227
Did we ever
have a chance to win?

671
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,927
No.

672
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,697
We follow our orders.

673
01:08:33,268 --> 01:08:35,303
Hey Reinhart, hang on to this.

674
01:08:36,971 --> 01:08:38,106
Yes, sir.

680
01:08:49,184 --> 01:08:50,252
Let's get below.

681
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:57,791
The American radios...

682
01:08:57,892 --> 01:08:58,692
For your eyes only.

683
01:09:05,066 --> 01:09:08,436
Admiral Donitz, general
orders to stand down.

684
01:09:09,237 --> 01:09:10,438
Await further instructions.

685
01:09:15,177 --> 01:09:17,279
- Does the crew know?
- Not yet.

686
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:19,381
Is it true?

687
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:21,049
- Hitler dead?
- Must be true.

688
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,089
Propaganda.

689
01:09:23,113 --> 01:09:25,353
American propaganda
is not like our propaganda.

690
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,189
What do we do?

691
01:09:34,162 --> 01:09:36,198
Have the men
assemble the rocket.

692
01:09:36,431 --> 01:09:37,932
But the Admiral, he said...

693
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:40,068
Hold and await
further instructions.

694
01:09:40,168 --> 01:09:42,304
We may only get one
chance. I want to be ready.

695
01:09:43,837 --> 01:09:45,440
If we work the men in shifts,
we can assemble it faster.

696
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,142
I will see it is done.

697
01:09:48,008 --> 01:09:50,045
This is our chance.
We will be ready.

698
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:50,911
Yes, sir.

699
01:09:54,382 --> 01:09:56,084
This is the captain, hear this.

700
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,054
We're at the gates of our enemy.

701
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:02,224
We will prepare to attack.

702
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,065
Oh, thanks.

703
01:10:11,799 --> 01:10:13,435
Nights like these,
we can all use a cup.

704
01:10:17,972 --> 01:10:18,806
What is it?

705
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,175
Hitler is dead.

706
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:21,875
Just announced.

707
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:29,883
War is done.

708
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,288
- Sir?
- Yeah?

709
01:10:33,555 --> 01:10:34,389
Kessler.

710
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,325
What about him?

711
01:10:37,425 --> 01:10:40,128
His file indicates he lost his
family in the Dresden fire bombings.

712
01:10:40,228 --> 01:10:41,529
All of them?

713
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:42,896
Yes.

714
01:10:44,566 --> 01:10:45,500
Got nothing to lose.

715
01:10:47,269 --> 01:10:49,304
He doesn't care about Hitler.
Put the 10th on high alert.

716
01:10:49,404 --> 01:10:50,372
Sir.

717
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,441
I miss you.

718
01:11:37,385 --> 01:11:41,222
Sir, she is ready.

719
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,559
See the fine work
you've done, Lieutenant.

720
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:01,008
Attention!

721
01:12:03,977 --> 01:12:07,848
Men, each one of
you should be proud

722
01:12:09,184 --> 01:12:10,452
to call yourself German.

723
01:12:13,355 --> 01:12:15,223
You're all true Kriegsmarine.

724
01:12:17,392 --> 01:12:21,596
Sir, we have contact at 8573.

725
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:25,567
- Merchant?
- American Navy.

726
01:12:25,667 --> 01:12:26,867
Sir, they found us.

727
01:12:33,108 --> 01:12:34,542
Can we fire
the rocket from here?

728
01:12:35,443 --> 01:12:38,079
We need to get closer to
the shore to fire the rocket.

729
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:39,347
We're still too far away.

730
01:12:46,688 --> 01:12:48,523
Sir, your orders?

731
01:13:09,043 --> 01:13:11,011
Sir, we have contact.

732
01:13:11,112 --> 01:13:12,680
- Is it her?
- Yes, sir.

733
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:14,582
Sound general quarters.

734
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,285
General
quarters, general quarters.

735
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:24,659
Men.

736
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,960
Hitler is dead.

737
01:13:30,765 --> 01:13:32,467
We have two options.

738
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:37,138
Surrender or fight.

739
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:48,949
We are with you, sir.

740
01:13:57,325 --> 01:13:58,359
We fight.

741
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,009
Helmsman,
take the boat 93 degrees,

742
01:14:16,444 --> 01:14:17,579
six knots.

743
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,012
Yes, sir.

744
01:14:19,347 --> 01:14:21,282
- Battle stations.
- Battle stations!

745
01:14:21,382 --> 01:14:22,450
Battle stations!

746
01:14:35,797 --> 01:14:38,166
Sir,
they made contact.

747
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:39,313
They found her?

748
01:14:39,337 --> 01:14:41,302
Latest reports had them
closing in on her position.

749
01:14:41,402 --> 01:14:42,170
Just a matter of time.

750
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:46,107
Checkmate. Checkmate!

751
01:14:50,411 --> 01:14:52,313
Sir, the signal's
getting stronger.

752
01:14:53,548 --> 01:14:54,382
It's getting closer?

753
01:14:55,183 --> 01:14:56,484
Sir, it's coming straight at us.

754
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,428
On this course, we are
going straight into warships.

755
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:09,464
Prepare to dive.

756
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:10,331
Prepare to dive!

757
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,402
Keep on this course
through the shallows.

758
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:18,339
Sir, on this course
we will split them.

759
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:24,145
They cannot fire their depth
charges so close to their own boats.

760
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,582
Increase speed, eight knots.

761
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,118
Yes, sir.
Increase speed.

762
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:31,653
Increase speed, eight knots.

763
01:15:37,692 --> 01:15:39,193
- You find her?
- No.

764
01:15:40,562 --> 01:15:41,796
It appears to be attacking.

765
01:15:42,864 --> 01:15:44,299
What? How?

766
01:15:58,813 --> 01:16:01,249
Captain, the U-boat's
coming up alongside us, sir.

767
01:16:03,451 --> 01:16:04,552
Get on the surface guns.

768
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:06,521
Yes, sir.

769
01:16:06,621 --> 01:16:07,722
You heard him, get on the
surface guns, let's go.

770
01:16:26,641 --> 01:16:28,476
Captain,
the guns aren't long enough.

771
01:16:29,811 --> 01:16:32,146
Sir, she's going to get away.

772
01:16:33,448 --> 01:16:34,382
I don't think so.

773
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:40,388
Sir, we are clear.

774
01:16:45,326 --> 01:16:48,262
Sir, there are
more ships on the sonar.

775
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:03,611
Captain, the rest of
the 10th has arrived.

776
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:05,880
Right on cue.

777
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:08,249
How much closer?

778
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,884
We should be in range.

779
01:17:10,485 --> 01:17:12,153
We take
our chances on the surface.

780
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,321
Blow the ballast.

781
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,756
Yes, sir.
Blow the ballast!

782
01:17:14,856 --> 01:17:15,623
Blow the ballast!

783
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:34,342
Captain, the sub.
It has surfaced.

784
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,244
What? Attacking?

785
01:17:36,344 --> 01:17:36,911
Come see.

786
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,218
Is it attacking?

787
01:17:45,687 --> 01:17:47,288
I think it's about to fire.

788
01:17:47,388 --> 01:17:47,955
Fire what?

789
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:49,524
It's a rocket.

790
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:54,295
All due respect, sir, I wanna
see my mom again after this war.

791
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:57,365
I'll get you home
to your mother.

792
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,484
Sir.

793
01:18:28,796 --> 01:18:32,734
General orders to all
U-boats, cease operations.

794
01:18:33,901 --> 01:18:36,337
Stand down, stand down.

795
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:40,775
We are too late.

796
01:18:48,883 --> 01:18:50,785
Sir, the sub has surfaced.

797
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:52,787
The 10th is waiting
for your orders.

798
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:55,590
What do you wanna do?

799
01:18:58,860 --> 01:18:59,927
Blow it out of the water.

800
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,462
Sir. Sir,
we have to abandon ship.

801
01:20:08,663 --> 01:20:09,797
Get the men out.

802
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:12,433
Captain.

803
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,835
Come on, Captain.

804
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:19,874
Captain goes down with his ship.

805
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:22,510
It's my duty.

806
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:27,548
Now go. Go!

807
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:33,921
Thank you, sir.
