1
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,524
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:40,864
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:44,801
Keyser.

4
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:50,271
Ready?

5
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:03,286
What time is it?

6
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:05,817
12:30.

7
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:14,358
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:18,088
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:20,597
The driver didn't see anyone,
but someone fucked up.

10
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,294
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,376
- Mr.McManus?
- Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

12
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:34,675
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

13
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:43,921
Todd Hockney?

14
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:47,521
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

15
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:53,928
- Shit.
- Freeze!

16
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:55,330
Hold it!

17
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:02,102
Sure you brought enough guys?

18
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,036
It's quite simple:

19
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:43,980
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

20
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:45,277
In other words...

21
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,444
...the atmosphere will not
be painted on the walls.

22
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:53,619
- Let me give you an example--
- This I had to see for myself.

23
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:57,250
David.

24
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,599
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

25
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,133
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

26
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:07,234
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

27
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:11,100
These gentlemen
are from the New York Police Department.

28
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:14,144
You look good.
Better than I would have thought.

29
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:19,108
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

30
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:23,152
Mr.Keaton?

31
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,787
Will you excuse us for a moment?

32
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,791
We have some questions
to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

33
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,832
No. Please, sit down.

34
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,394
This is a small problem.

35
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,535
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

36
00:08:04,663 --> 00:08:06,927
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

37
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:09,729
These guys were hard-core hijackers...

38
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,731
...but there I was.

39
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:16,331
At that point, I wasn't scared.

40
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:19,343
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

41
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,008
Besides, it was fun.

42
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,948
I got to make like I was notorious.

43
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,442
You all know the drill.

44
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,218
When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.

45
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,626
Number 1, step forward.

46
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:42,292
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

47
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,004
Number 2, step forward.

48
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:52,503
Gimme the fuckin' keys,
you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

49
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:56,241
Knock it off. Get back.
Number 3, step forward.

50
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:08,785
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
- In English, please.

51
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,894
- Excuse me?
- In English.

52
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:15,633
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

53
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,635
Number 4, step forward.

54
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,668
It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.

55
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:23,933
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

56
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:25,767
It was the cops' fault.

57
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:28,904
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

58
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:31,106
Who knows what can happen?

59
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:34,649
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

60
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,854
This has really got to be embarrassing
for you guys.

61
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:40,185
They drilled us all night.

62
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,524
Someone was mad about that truck
hijacking and the cops had nothing.

63
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,860
They were hoping somebody would slip up
and give them something.

64
00:09:46,932 --> 00:09:49,867
They knew we wouldn't fight,
they knew how to lean on us.

65
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:53,063
They've been doing it forever.
Our rights went out the window.

66
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:55,038
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

67
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:57,940
They went after McManus first.
Topnotch entry man.

68
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,442
What truck?

69
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:02,939
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- "Fucko"?

70
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,416
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.

71
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:10,580
Wanna know what your pal
Fenster told us?

72
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:12,385
- Say who?
- McManus.

73
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,186
He told us another story.

74
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:17,987
Is that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

75
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:21,257
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a real tight-ass.

76
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,598
But when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

77
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,366
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

78
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,408
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

79
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:32,841
- I'm shaking. Come on.
- Okay.

80
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,937
- Answer my questions.
- Can you hear me in the back?

81
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,039
Hello?

82
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:40,244
I want my lawyer.

83
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:43,145
I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

84
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,046
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.

85
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:50,120
Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

86
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:52,753
You guys don't have
a fuckin' leg to stand on.

87
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:54,093
You think so, tough guy?

88
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,691
I can put you in Queens
during the hijacking.

89
00:10:56,768 --> 00:10:57,962
Really?

90
00:10:58,236 --> 00:10:59,703
I live in Queens.

91
00:10:59,771 --> 00:11:02,171
Did you put that
together yourself, Einstein?

92
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,834
You got a team of monkeys
working full time on this?

93
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,243
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

94
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,309
I fuck your father in the shower,
and have a snack.

95
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:15,717
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

96
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:18,585
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

97
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:19,681
But Keaton?

98
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:22,420
Keaton was the real prize for them
for obvious reasons.

99
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,223
It was your mistake, not mine.

100
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,992
Did you ever stop to ask me?

101
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:35,564
I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

102
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,442
I'm a businessman.

103
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,671
What's that? The restaurant business?

104
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:44,648
No. From now on you're in the
"getting fucked by us" business.

105
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:47,150
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

106
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:48,811
Like I said...

107
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,214
...it was your mistake...

108
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,823
...not mine.

109
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,623
You charge me with this shit...

110
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:58,559
...and I'll beat it.

111
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:00,522
Okay?

112
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,330
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

113
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,864
Really, somebody's got to do something
about this shit.

114
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,341
They put me in holding every five minutes.
So I did a little time.

115
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:16,871
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds it's way gone?

116
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:18,210
Fuck 'em.

117
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,550
Fenster, will you relax?

118
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:25,084
- These guys don't have any probable cause.
- You fuckin' right. No PC.

119
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:28,615
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

120
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:31,184
They treat me like a criminal.

121
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,226
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

122
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,269
Why'd you got to go and do that?

123
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,097
- I'm trying to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

124
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:44,369
You're making me tired all over.

125
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:45,567
Fuck it then.

126
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,439
- I heard you were dead.
- Yeah?

127
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,749
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

128
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:55,284
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

129
00:12:55,587 --> 00:13:00,149
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

130
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:01,249
Who's that?

131
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,951
She's a heavyweight criminal
lawyer from uptown.

132
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,963
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

133
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:07,961
How 'bout it, Keaton?

134
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,861
You a lawyer's wife?

135
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:12,570
What kind of retainer you giving her?

136
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:18,106
Do your friend a favor...

137
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:20,573
...tell him to keep quiet.

138
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,070
Dean Keaton...

139
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:26,141
Gone clean?

140
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,243
Say it ain't so.

141
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:31,852
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, forget him.

142
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,420
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

143
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,991
This whole thing was a shakedown.

144
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:40,787
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

145
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,128
It's always you and four dummies.

146
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:47,467
The PD are paying homeless guys
$10 a head half the time.

147
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,936
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

148
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:54,872
What's a voice lineup?
Public defender could get you out of that.

149
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:58,438
- Why the hell was I strip searched?
- It was the feds.

150
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:01,015
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

151
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:04,852
Customs comes down on NYPD
for answers. They come up with us.

152
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,218
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my ass.

153
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:09,655
Is it Friday already?

154
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:12,990
Yeah, lover boy.

155
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:16,225
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

156
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:20,097
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

157
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:24,066
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

158
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:27,270
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, workingman?

159
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,075
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

160
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:32,412
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?

161
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:34,577
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

162
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:35,950
His name is Verbal.

163
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,019
Verbal Kint.

164
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,579
- Verbal?
- Yeah.

165
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:42,786
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

166
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,928
I was going to tell you to shut up.

167
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,725
- We met before, once or twice.
- In County. I was in for fraud.

168
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,064
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

169
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:54,069
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

170
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:57,136
- So you did it.
- All right, now look...

171
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,274
...we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

172
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:05,177
I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

173
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:08,949
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

174
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,884
Why don't you just calm down?

175
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,290
What do you care what he has to say?

176
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,224
I'm just talking here.

177
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:19,721
It seems to me like Mr.Hockney
wants to hear it...

178
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:21,789
...and I know Fenster's down.

179
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,397
What about you, guy?

180
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,135
I'm interested.

181
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:29,600
There. See?

182
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:33,001
I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

183
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:35,042
Why don't you just shut up?

184
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:42,677
You're missing the point.

185
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:44,413
No.

186
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,491
You're missing the point.

187
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,126
I don't want to hear anything from you.

188
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,686
I don't care about your job.

189
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:55,658
And...

190
00:15:57,836 --> 00:16:00,361
...I want nothing to do with any of you.

191
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,036
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

192
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,008
Dean Keaton...

193
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,270
...gone the high road.

194
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:13,909
What is the world coming to?

195
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:20,185
Fuck him.

196
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,557
And that was how it started:

197
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:29,031
Five of us brought in
on a trumped-up charge...

198
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,068
...to be leaned on by half-wits.

199
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,840
I really can't talk about it much here.

200
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:40,503
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...

201
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,843
...was that these men would never break,
never lie down.

202
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,842
Never bend over for anybody.

203
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,080
Anybody.

204
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:08,233
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

205
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,565
- How many dead?
- 15 so far.

206
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:13,440
They're still pulling bodies
out of the water.

207
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,546
- Any survivors?
- Two.

208
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:18,411
One guy's in County hospital,
but he's in a coma.

209
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:21,577
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York.

210
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:24,019
The chief wants this place sealed off.

211
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:26,955
If you have any questions, give him a call.

212
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,358
This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

213
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:08,660
If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro Police Department...

214
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:11,566
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.

215
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,901
- Why can't I see him?
- I told you...

216
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:20,968
...the DA came down here
last night ready to arraign...

217
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:23,104
...even before they moved him to County.

218
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:25,547
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

219
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:29,144
...the DA comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him around.

220
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,348
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

221
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:36,451
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

222
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,295
What is that?

223
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:42,458
I give the DA credit for getting that much,
you understand?

224
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:44,058
Excuse me, sir.

225
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,229
This whole thing has turned political.
The mayor was here last night.

226
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:52,640
The chief. This morning,
the governor called, okay?

227
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,908
I'm telling you, this guy is protected
from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

228
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,415
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

229
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:01,714
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.

230
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:03,651
- No.
- I gotta see him.

231
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:06,383
- No. I can't--
- You gotta do this for me.

232
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,688
I came a long way for this.

233
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,827
Dave, please.

234
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:17,199
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

235
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,501
He's paranoid about being recorded.

236
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:23,166
- He knows the rooms are wired.
- I quit.

237
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:26,210
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat.

238
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,505
- He won't go into the interrogation room.
- Then someplace else.

239
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:30,741
Where?

240
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:34,012
No, no.

241
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,948
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it?

242
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:41,514
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories
to answer all these questions.

243
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:44,960
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

244
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:47,896
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

245
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:52,431
- He doesn't know what you want to know.
- I don't think he does, not exactly.

246
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,432
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

247
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:59,436
I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier...

248
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:03,811
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

249
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:07,484
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

250
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,248
He's dead.

251
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:12,680
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

252
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:14,490
They're all dead.

253
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,857
I don't care how tough
you say Keaton was...

254
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:19,829
...nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

255
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:26,059
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness an hour ago.

256
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,571
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

257
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,140
- Hungarian?
- That might have been it.

258
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,110
- Most of them were Hungarians.
- You gotta put this on.

259
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:36,840
Burn victims are very susceptible
to infection.

260
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:39,850
And, of course, there's no smoking.

261
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:52,189
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

262
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:53,389
Is he gonna die?

263
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:56,126
He's burned 60 percent of his body,
broken ribs--

264
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,862
Call security. Put a man on the door.

265
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:01,098
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

266
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,498
Do it.

267
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:04,439
Do it now.

268
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,945
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

269
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:14,073
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor
is Arkosh Kovash.

270
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:15,981
Yes, I'm sure.

271
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,182
No, he's all fucked up.

272
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,651
I can't hear you.

273
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,352
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

274
00:21:24,963 --> 00:21:25,987
Yes.

275
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:28,865
No, not till I put a man on him.

276
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,366
Send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

277
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:34,232
He's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

278
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:35,670
Keyser Soze.

279
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:39,206
- What?
- Keyser Soze!

280
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:45,343
No shit?

281
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:49,616
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

282
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:52,218
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

283
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:29,556
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

284
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:31,828
Nice to meet you.

285
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:34,488
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

286
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:38,023
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

287
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,738
I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

288
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:45,139
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

289
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,608
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

290
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,046
Once I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

291
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:54,141
- It was all thick and gooey--
- I'll get your fucking coffee.

292
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:56,778
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

293
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:02,887
That guy is tense.

294
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:04,788
Tension is a killer.

295
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:07,865
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

296
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:10,867
The baritone was this guy
named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

297
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:13,596
Like, orca fat.
He was so stressed in the morning--

298
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:17,630
- You know we're trying to help you.
- Sure, and I appreciate that.

299
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:20,837
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

300
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:23,506
I would've liked to have been a fed,
but my CP--

301
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:27,540
You're not tellin' us everything.
I know you know something.

302
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:29,753
I told the DA everything I know.

303
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:34,056
I know you like Keaton.

304
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:38,284
- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.

305
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:39,795
He was a corrupt cop.

306
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:42,594
Sure. 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.

307
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:45,299
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

308
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:47,496
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

309
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,305
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

310
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:57,205
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

311
00:23:58,116 --> 00:23:59,879
May I have a cigarette?

312
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:05,988
- According to your statement--
- I need a light.

313
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:12,324
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

314
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:14,023
...run-of-the-mill--

315
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:21,896
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

316
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,198
...run-of-the-mill scams.

317
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:27,039
It's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

318
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:30,410
I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

319
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:37,086
I do have the weapons charge.
I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

320
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:39,214
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

321
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:42,785
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

322
00:24:42,994 --> 00:24:45,963
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

323
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,930
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

324
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,490
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

325
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:53,537
I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well connected.

326
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:56,300
He's got lots of friends inside
who do favors for him.

327
00:24:56,374 --> 00:25:00,208
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

328
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:04,003
- There's nothing there on Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.

329
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:07,141
Know what I've learned on the job?
How to spot a murderer.

330
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:09,584
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

331
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:11,121
Put them in jail overnight.

332
00:25:11,189 --> 00:25:13,521
Next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

333
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:17,220
If you're guilty, you know you're caught.
You let your guard down.

334
00:25:17,328 --> 00:25:19,523
- You follow me?
- No.

335
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:21,264
Let me get to the point.

336
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:27,262
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

337
00:25:27,338 --> 00:25:29,636
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

338
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,332
I'm not a rat.

339
00:25:38,716 --> 00:25:39,910
Thanks.

340
00:25:44,255 --> 00:25:48,021
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala
we used to make fresh coffee.

341
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:51,152
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

342
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:55,097
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?

343
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,396
What happened after the lineup?

344
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:06,299
The desk sergeant was telling me
he couldn't release you.

345
00:26:06,377 --> 00:26:09,505
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

346
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,979
Damn police.

347
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,142
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

348
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,314
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.
- Forget about it.

349
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,154
I'll have this thing in front
of a grand jury by Monday.

350
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:24,160
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

351
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:28,962
What did Fortier and Renault say?

352
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:32,127
They asked for more time
to think about investing.

353
00:26:32,203 --> 00:26:33,295
Damn it.

354
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:34,998
More time for what?

355
00:26:35,473 --> 00:26:38,931
No matter how you cover my tracks
they're still gonna find out about me.

356
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,172
Give me some credit.

357
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:43,744
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

358
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:47,910
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't--
- It's never going to stop, period.

359
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,717
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

360
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:55,656
It's finished.

361
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:57,360
I'm finished.

362
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,195
Don't give up on me now.

363
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:09,206
It's never gonna stop.

364
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,845
I love you.

365
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,214
They ruined me in there tonight.

366
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,585
I love you.

367
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,316
Do you hear me?

368
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:35,624
What?

369
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:39,566
All right.

370
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:42,662
Let's just go to my place.

371
00:27:57,989 --> 00:27:59,980
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

372
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:05,653
Let's go.

373
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:10,828
Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition:

374
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:13,495
A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.

375
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:15,633
We all knew it could be done.

376
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:18,537
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

377
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,804
To do it right took five men.

378
00:28:21,312 --> 00:28:23,177
Five men meant Keaton.

379
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,315
Keaton took convincing.

380
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:31,049
New York's finest taxi service.

381
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:33,151
Bullshit.

382
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,220
Bullshit.

383
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,485
They don't operate anymore.

384
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:42,824
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

385
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,835
They're pickin' up a guy
smuggling emeralds from South America.

386
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:47,700
McManus already has a fence set up.

387
00:28:47,772 --> 00:28:50,707
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

388
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:53,767
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

389
00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:58,338
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

390
00:28:58,582 --> 00:29:00,948
They won't take me unless you go.

391
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,047
Look at me. I need this.

392
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:07,320
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

393
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:11,216
I'm not knocking you. You got
a good scam going with this lawyer.

394
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,160
Sorry.

395
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:20,002
It's okay.

396
00:29:21,238 --> 00:29:23,968
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

397
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:27,771
You okay?

398
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:29,840
I was out of line.

399
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:33,515
But they're never gonna stop with us.
You know that.

400
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:36,314
As clean as you get,
they'll never let you go now.

401
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:40,414
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts,
and we get well in the meantime.

402
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:45,989
You sure you're okay?

403
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:47,996
I'll be all right.

404
00:30:02,513 --> 00:30:03,844
Look, I...

405
00:30:04,615 --> 00:30:07,083
- ...sometimes get--
- Forget it.

406
00:30:10,488 --> 00:30:12,820
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

407
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,096
So...

408
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,638
...how do they wanna do it?

409
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:33,838
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

410
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,640
Fenster? Hockney?

411
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:40,511
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

412
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:43,017
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

413
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:46,386
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

414
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:05,873
$3 million?

415
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,210
Maybe more.

416
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:15,216
No killing.

417
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:18,786
Not if we do it my way.

418
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:55,953
New York's finest taxi service
was not your normal taxi service.

419
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:59,985
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket...

420
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:02,555
...driving smugglers and drug dealers
all over the city.

421
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,295
For $300 a mile,
you got your own blue and white...

422
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:08,395
...and a police escort.
They even had their own business cards.

423
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:12,670
After a while, somebody started asking
questions, and the taxi service shut down.

424
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:16,372
Ever since then, Internal Affairs
has been waiting to catch them in the act.

425
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:18,005
That's where we came in.

426
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:21,546
- So, how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.

427
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,820
Will this get me to Staten Island?

428
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,320
Are you kiddin' me?
This will get you to Cape Cod.

429
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:32,326
McManus came to us with the job.
Fenster got the vans.

430
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:34,023
Hockney supplied the hardware.

431
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:36,760
I came through with
how to do it so no one got killed.

432
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:40,429
But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.

433
00:32:40,504 --> 00:32:44,133
A little "fuck you" from the five
of us to the NYPD.

434
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:48,672
Watch this.

435
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:50,871
Careful.

436
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:52,809
Come on, asshole!

437
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:55,549
Holy shit!

438
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:59,681
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!

439
00:32:59,757 --> 00:33:01,816
Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!

440
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,917
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

441
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:06,622
- What do you guys want?
- Put your fuckin' thing away.

442
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,721
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

443
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:11,492
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

444
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:14,834
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
- Shut up!

445
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:18,807
Fuck.

446
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:23,841
'Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.

447
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:25,575
- Don't move!
- Give him the shit!

448
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:27,640
Give him the fuckin' thing!

449
00:33:27,718 --> 00:33:29,549
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

450
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,947
Hurry up! Come on!

451
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:34,289
- Now the money!
- There's no money.

452
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:37,327
- Give me the money now!
- There's no fuckin' money.

453
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:39,019
Give him the fuckin' money!

454
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,797
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the money!

455
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:44,263
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

456
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:47,228
You know who the fuck I am?

457
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:50,100
You people know
who the fuck I am? Fuck!

458
00:33:50,774 --> 00:33:52,503
We do now, jerk-off.

459
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,607
Cocksucker.

460
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,418
Wait a minute. What's that?

461
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:04,911
What the fuck?

462
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:06,819
Holy shit!

463
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:10,517
Go!

464
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,498
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.

465
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:28,136
The press was on the scene
before the police were.

466
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:30,680
Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.

467
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:33,581
Within a few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.

468
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:37,580
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

469
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:39,281
It was beautiful.

470
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:48,988
I owe you $2.50.

471
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:51,932
Dr.Keaton.

472
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:58,266
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

473
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:01,236
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

474
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,136
In California?

475
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:08,048
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I--

476
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:12,179
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.
You and Fenster? No.

477
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:16,423
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?
- So then, who's gonna go?

478
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:18,592
We all go.

479
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,628
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

480
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:26,302
My problem, is you and Fenster
honeymooning in California...

481
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,464
...while the rest of us are sittin' here
holding our dicks.

482
00:35:29,673 --> 00:35:31,197
The job's over.

483
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,936
Cool it.

484
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:36,237
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

485
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:40,381
You wanna dance?

486
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,152
Ladies.

487
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:58,934
I would like to propose a toast.

488
00:36:00,404 --> 00:36:01,894
There you go.

489
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:05,965
To Mr.Verbal...

490
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,646
...the man with the plan.

491
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:24,388
We're gonna miss the flight.

492
00:36:25,462 --> 00:36:28,556
Don't do this.
Send her a note. Something.

493
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,163
I said we'll make it.

494
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:07,197
We're gonna miss the plane.

495
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:10,099
She'll understand.

496
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,652
That's heartwarming. Really.

497
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:35,595
I'm weepy.

498
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:38,758
You wanna wait outside?

499
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,137
You guys wanted to know what happened.
I'm telling you.

500
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,698
Come on, Verbal.

501
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,745
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
You expect me to believe that he retired?

502
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:54,148
For a woman?

503
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:58,613
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

504
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:01,349
- He loved her.
- Sure.

505
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:04,883
I'm supposed to believe that hitting
the taxi service wasn't his idea.

506
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:08,728
- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.

507
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:10,699
Who else would know better?

508
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:13,565
- That job had his name on it.
- Edie had him turned around.

509
00:38:14,004 --> 00:38:15,801
Let me tell you something.

510
00:38:15,872 --> 00:38:17,533
I know Dean Keaton.

511
00:38:17,608 --> 00:38:20,406
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

512
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:23,071
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

513
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,678
IAD indicted him on three counts of
murder before he was kicked off the force.

514
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:30,049
Don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

515
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:31,677
You got him all wrong.

516
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:33,915
Do I?

517
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:38,824
Dean Keaton was under indictment
seven times while he was on the force.

518
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:42,454
In every case,
witnesses either reversed their testimony...

519
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:45,433
...or died before they could testify.

520
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:50,505
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

521
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,675
He killed three prisoners inside.

522
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,405
Of course, I can't prove this...

523
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,308
...but I can't prove the best part either.

524
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:02,380
Dean Keaton was dead.

525
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,646
Did you know that?

526
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:08,652
He died in a fire two years ago,
during an investigation into the murder...

527
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:11,819
...of a witness who was going
to testify against him.

528
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:14,987
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

529
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:16,828
...just before it blew up.

530
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,328
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

531
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:24,131
It blew up and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

532
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:30,304
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

533
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:32,873
One killed himself in his car.

534
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:35,916
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

535
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:41,190
Let's get this show on the road.

536
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:43,988
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many--

537
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:46,825
I promise we'll be out
before he blows his porch light.

538
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:49,331
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

539
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:51,299
Everyone calm down, all right?

540
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:54,701
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

541
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:09,483
- He says they were buying--
- Dope. We know.

542
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:18,126
He doesn't know
what they were buying, but not dope.

543
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:20,558
- People.
- What?

544
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:30,235
He needs guarantees...

545
00:40:30,574 --> 00:40:34,510
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life is in danger.

546
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:36,641
He saw the Devil.

547
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,672
Looked him in the eye.

548
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:41,343
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.

549
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:43,909
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

550
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,450
...about the Devil.

551
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:48,450
Who's the Devil?

552
00:40:53,663 --> 00:40:55,062
Keyser Soze.

553
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:01,367
Keyser Soze?

554
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:04,269
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

555
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:06,804
He saw Keyser Soze?

556
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,641
- He saw his face.
- All right.

557
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:18,682
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

558
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:20,579
Describe him.

559
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,624
Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call...

560
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,726
...telling me I can find Keaton
eating at Mondino's, and there he is.

561
00:41:34,538 --> 00:41:37,530
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

562
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:41,199
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him...

563
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,208
...we had to let him go.

564
00:41:43,814 --> 00:41:47,079
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

565
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:48,878
And then he had lunch.

566
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,253
I don't know about that.

567
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:55,015
I don't think you do,
but you say you saw Keaton die.

568
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:58,819
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there.

569
00:41:58,895 --> 00:42:01,227
I think he's behind
that circus at the harbor.

570
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:04,825
My bet is he's using you because
you're stupid and think he's your friend.

571
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:07,199
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

572
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:10,402
I wanna be sure
before I go back to New York.

573
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:13,408
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

574
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:15,343
What lawyer?

575
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:17,237
What lawyer?

576
00:42:17,314 --> 00:42:20,044
Back when I was in
that barbershop quartet--

577
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:22,550
You don't think I know you held out
on the DA?

578
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:24,276
What did you leave out?

579
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:26,618
I could be on the phone
to Ruby in 10 minutes.

580
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,352
- The DA gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

581
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:31,960
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

582
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:35,520
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

583
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:38,224
...every creep and scumbag
that walks the street...

584
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:40,997
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.
You talk to me...

585
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:43,562
...or that precious immunity
they grant you...

586
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,940
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

587
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:51,775
There was a lawyer.

588
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,414
Kobayashi.

589
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:59,854
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

590
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:02,255
Convince me.

591
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:05,188
Tell me every last detail.

592
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:27,983
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.

593
00:43:28,952 --> 00:43:32,581
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.

594
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:35,814
- Still, we should have known better.
- How you doing?

595
00:43:35,892 --> 00:43:38,918
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

596
00:43:39,863 --> 00:43:41,763
How's it going, Fenster?

597
00:43:42,632 --> 00:43:44,759
Don't need to open it, right?

598
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,369
You must be Keaton.

599
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,207
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

600
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:59,471
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan.

601
00:44:00,317 --> 00:44:01,841
You interested in more work?

602
00:44:02,752 --> 00:44:05,687
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.

603
00:44:07,257 --> 00:44:08,690
That's too bad.

604
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,254
I got a ton of work and no good people.

605
00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:13,629
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

606
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,760
There's this jeweler
out of Texas named Saul.

607
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,926
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

608
00:44:19,235 --> 00:44:22,636
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

609
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:25,498
The word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

610
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:30,302
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

611
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,112
- Simple.
- What about security?

612
00:44:33,183 --> 00:44:36,516
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

613
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,551
Give me time to check it out?

614
00:44:38,922 --> 00:44:41,083
I expect nothing less from you, man.

615
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:44,484
Good to see you. We'll call you.

616
00:44:44,561 --> 00:44:46,961
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

617
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:56,362
A friend in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

618
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,400
The way I hear it,
you did time with ol' Spook.

619
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,340
A good man, wasn't he?

620
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,771
I used to run dope for him.

621
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,508
Too bad he got shivved.

622
00:45:09,552 --> 00:45:10,712
I shivved him.

623
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:16,816
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

624
00:45:18,294 --> 00:45:19,955
I appreciate that.

625
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:22,829
But just out of curiosity...

626
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,062
...was it business or personal?

627
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:29,995
A bit of both.

628
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,202
Like I said...

629
00:45:33,576 --> 00:45:36,443
...you give me a call if you're interested.

630
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:42,312
Is there a problem?

631
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,214
One job.

632
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:47,349
That was the deal.

633
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:53,857
One job?

634
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,128
One job?

635
00:45:59,836 --> 00:46:01,770
That's a good one.

636
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,532
Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

637
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,804
He can convince anyone he's someone else,
but never himself.

638
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,509
It took one day with McManus nagging,
and we went back to work.

639
00:46:29,232 --> 00:46:31,792
I get out of my car,
and the thing is wrecked.

640
00:46:31,868 --> 00:46:35,360
I look in the backseat of the other car,
and this woman's totally naked.

641
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:38,532
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

642
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:41,403
- Freeze, motherfucker!
- Stay right there!

643
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:45,280
There's a second one here, somewhere.

644
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:52,249
Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!

645
00:46:58,428 --> 00:47:01,864
Give me the fuckin' case.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

646
00:47:02,098 --> 00:47:03,861
Give me the fuckin' case!

647
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:10,863
- Come on!
- Don't move!

648
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:47,936
Hand over the case.

649
00:47:49,078 --> 00:47:51,103
Hand over the fuckin' case.

650
00:48:15,104 --> 00:48:16,765
Come on, let's go!

651
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,967
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

652
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,200
Let's go!

653
00:48:46,436 --> 00:48:47,528
Fuck.

654
00:48:50,673 --> 00:48:54,370
- Looks like a lot of china to me.
- Shit.

655
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:01,172
Guys, come on.

656
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:04,976
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

657
00:49:05,054 --> 00:49:07,181
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

658
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:09,418
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.

659
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:12,359
- You'd better, or I'm gonna.
- Shut up.

660
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:22,170
What am I supposed to do with that?

661
00:49:22,472 --> 00:49:25,600
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.
I don't know what that is.

662
00:49:25,675 --> 00:49:27,700
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

663
00:49:27,944 --> 00:49:30,071
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

664
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:31,135
Who?

665
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:33,406
I don't know. Some limey.

666
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:37,212
He's a middleman for somebody.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

667
00:49:37,287 --> 00:49:39,585
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you.

668
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:41,351
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.

669
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:43,749
We wanna meet him, okay?

670
00:49:44,093 --> 00:49:45,560
That's funny.

671
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:49,924
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

672
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,500
Okay, we'll meet him.

673
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,802
- I'll call you.
- Good. Let's go.

674
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:58,238
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy:

675
00:49:58,775 --> 00:50:01,505
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

676
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:05,938
You're such a tough guy.
But do me a favor, all right?

677
00:50:06,015 --> 00:50:08,176
Get the fuck off my dick.

678
00:50:08,618 --> 00:50:10,017
No!

679
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,951
Put a leash on that puppy.

680
00:50:15,058 --> 00:50:18,323
It's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

681
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:21,156
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

682
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:24,859
Sooner or later,
they're gonna come around askin' me.

683
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:29,533
You have a sweet night, ladies.

684
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,605
Fuck you.

685
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:43,884
- So this lawyer--
- Kobayashi.

686
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,952
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

687
00:50:47,357 --> 00:50:50,190
And why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

688
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:52,261
Dave, someone to see you.

689
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,760
I've been looking all over for you.

690
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:03,465
You still after that coke that took a walk
out of that bloodbath yesterday?

691
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:06,337
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

692
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:10,072
I've been in LA County talking to a guy
they pulled out of a drainpipe...

693
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:11,909
...yesterday after the shootout.

694
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:14,176
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

695
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,515
He's part of a Hungarian mob.
They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

696
00:51:17,587 --> 00:51:20,147
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

697
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:23,522
- But there were--
- We know. But he says no on the dope.

698
00:51:23,593 --> 00:51:27,120
This Hungarian tells me they were
pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

699
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:30,791
They had no time for that kind of product,
and no means to move it.

700
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:32,858
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

701
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:36,194
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

702
00:51:36,272 --> 00:51:38,570
They were all very hush about it, he says.

703
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:42,973
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

704
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:45,309
You got the cripple in there
from New York?

705
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:46,973
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

706
00:51:47,216 --> 00:51:48,581
Who?

707
00:51:49,118 --> 00:51:51,018
Just bear with me here.

708
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:55,219
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!

709
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:59,456
We've been goin' over this
for an hour and a half.

710
00:51:59,896 --> 00:52:03,798
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

711
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:05,834
What we need to do is think.

712
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:07,500
Think back.

713
00:52:08,638 --> 00:52:11,402
Somebody with power...

714
00:52:11,941 --> 00:52:15,104
...somebody capable of tracking us
from New York to LA.

715
00:52:15,178 --> 00:52:18,272
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

716
00:52:18,848 --> 00:52:22,716
- Sit down.
- No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

717
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:24,582
Mr.Hockney, do stay.

718
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:26,686
Mr.Keaton.

719
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:29,387
Mr.Fenster I recognize
from his mug shots...

720
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:31,290
...as well as Mr.McManus.

721
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,354
I can only assume that you are Mr.Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

722
00:52:36,432 --> 00:52:40,129
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

723
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,031
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

724
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:47,938
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

725
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,104
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

726
00:52:53,282 --> 00:52:56,809
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

727
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:00,477
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

728
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,683
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

729
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,352
Who's your boss?

730
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:10,225
I work for Keyser Soze.

731
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:22,805
Who's Keyser Soze?

732
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:25,279
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

733
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:28,383
...I feel sure the rest
of your associates can tell you.

734
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:31,451
I come with an offer
directly from Mr.Soze.

735
00:53:31,754 --> 00:53:35,451
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?

736
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:40,618
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

737
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:44,859
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr.Soze...

738
00:53:44,934 --> 00:53:49,030
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

739
00:53:49,305 --> 00:53:52,399
A most profitable violation
of UN Regulations.

740
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:54,534
You had no way of knowing this...

741
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,773
...because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Soze...

742
00:53:57,847 --> 00:53:59,405
...without his knowledge.

743
00:53:59,749 --> 00:54:02,445
Earlier this year,
Mr.Fenster and Mr.McManus...

744
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:06,284
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

745
00:54:06,355 --> 00:54:10,621
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring also set for Pakistan.

746
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:14,719
Two months ago,
Mr.Hockney stole a truck...

747
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:17,322
...carrying gun parts through Queens.

748
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,029
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed
by the state of New York.

749
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:25,071
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

750
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:28,110
Again, Mr.Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

751
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:30,638
Which brings us to Mr.Kint.

752
00:54:31,814 --> 00:54:34,374
Nine months ago, one of Mr.Soze's...

753
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:39,012
...less than intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam...

754
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:41,188
...by a cripple.

755
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:43,855
He was relieved of $62,000.

756
00:54:44,694 --> 00:54:47,527
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

757
00:54:47,997 --> 00:54:51,831
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

758
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:53,399
You set up the lineup.

759
00:54:53,469 --> 00:54:56,700
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

760
00:54:56,772 --> 00:54:59,605
It seems Mr.Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

761
00:54:59,976 --> 00:55:03,503
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

762
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:05,774
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

763
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:08,778
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

764
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:11,579
Mr.Soze rarely works
with the same people for long...

765
00:55:11,654 --> 00:55:14,418
...and they never know
who they're working for.

766
00:55:14,557 --> 00:55:17,458
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

767
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:20,486
So, why are you telling us?

768
00:55:20,896 --> 00:55:25,060
Because you have stolen from Mr.Soze,
Mr.Fenster.

769
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:26,359
All of you.

770
00:55:26,435 --> 00:55:30,098
That you did not know it
is the only reason you're still alive.

771
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:34,369
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

772
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:38,644
Fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

773
00:55:39,115 --> 00:55:41,675
I don't think that is very relevant.

774
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:45,014
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg...

775
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:46,452
...and his bodyguards.

776
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:49,282
Mr.Redfoot can testify
to your involvement.

777
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:51,292
We can see to it that he will.

778
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,420
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen:

779
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,891
Mr.Soze's primary interest...

780
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,665
...is narcotics.

781
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:01,529
He has been competing, shall we say...

782
00:56:01,604 --> 00:56:04,072
...with a group of Argentineans
for several years.

783
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:07,106
Competing with Mr.Soze has taken its toll.

784
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,504
These Argentineans
are negotiating the sale...

785
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:14,447
...of $91 million in cocaine
in three days time.

786
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,617
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

787
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:20,451
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

788
00:56:21,257 --> 00:56:24,522
Mr.Soze would like you to stop the deal.

789
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:28,458
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

790
00:56:28,531 --> 00:56:31,125
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

791
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:36,802
Mr.Soze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine onboard.

792
00:56:37,506 --> 00:56:41,465
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr.Soze.

793
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:47,408
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

794
00:56:49,385 --> 00:56:51,979
A gift from Mr.Soze.

795
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:56,954
Good day, gentlemen.

796
00:58:05,795 --> 00:58:09,390
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've done since I was 18.

797
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:11,724
They fuckin' know everything.

798
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:14,665
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

799
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:30,175
No.

800
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:34,685
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

801
00:58:34,757 --> 00:58:37,851
Who's that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

802
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:43,692
- Bricks Marlin.
- He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

803
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:48,032
He said he always made five times
more money on it than the job was worth.

804
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:50,366
This guy's a pipe dream.

805
00:58:50,439 --> 00:58:52,600
Kobayashi's using him
for window dressing.

806
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:54,769
I don't know. This is bad.

807
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:59,008
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' setup.

808
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:02,882
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

809
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:07,484
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

810
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:11,850
Who is Keyser Soze?

811
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:16,896
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

812
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:18,991
Nobody ever believed he was real.

813
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:22,396
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him.

814
00:59:22,504 --> 00:59:25,530
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

815
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:28,701
You never knew. That was his power.

816
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:32,412
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

817
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:35,849
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

818
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,982
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

819
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:41,750
...was from his days in Turkey.

820
00:59:41,824 --> 00:59:44,759
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

821
00:59:44,827 --> 00:59:48,228
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns...

822
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:49,855
...or money or even numbers.

823
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:53,390
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

824
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:57,170
After a while they come into power,
and then they come after Soze.

825
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:00,538
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

826
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:04,210
They come to his home...

827
01:00:04,613 --> 01:00:07,207
...in the afternoon looking for his business.

828
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:11,549
They find his wife and kids in the house,
and decide to wait for Soze.

829
01:00:27,336 --> 01:00:31,602
He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

830
01:00:31,674 --> 01:00:35,075
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,
not to be trifled with.

831
01:00:35,144 --> 01:00:36,873
They let him know they meant business.

832
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,504
No!

833
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:45,843
They tell him they want his territory,
all his business.

834
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:49,782
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

835
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,118
Then he showed these men
of will what will really was.

836
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:17,619
He tells them he would
rather see his family dead...

837
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,352
...than live another day after this.

838
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:23,951
He lets the last Hungarian go...

839
01:01:24,193 --> 01:01:28,129
...waits until his family is in the ground,
and goes after the rest of the mob.

840
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:31,192
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

841
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,530
...he kills their parents and their friends.

842
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:36,299
He burns down the houses they live in...

843
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:39,169
...and the stores they work in.

844
01:01:39,675 --> 01:01:43,202
He kills people that owe them money.
And like that...

845
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:46,343
...he's gone, underground.

846
01:01:46,415 --> 01:01:49,009
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

847
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:52,247
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

848
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:55,415
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

849
01:01:56,358 --> 01:01:58,349
No one ever really believes.

850
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,619
Do you believe in him?

851
01:02:03,165 --> 01:02:04,894
Keaton always said:

852
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,536
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

853
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:12,406
I believe in God.

854
01:02:12,775 --> 01:02:16,802
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Soze.

855
01:02:23,685 --> 01:02:25,710
You give any weight to this?

856
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:28,256
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice.

857
01:02:28,323 --> 01:02:31,986
He's got a file on Soze in DC.
It's been a hobby of his for a while.

858
01:02:32,094 --> 01:02:35,495
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter
on The Incredible Hulk.

859
01:02:40,502 --> 01:02:41,935
You've heard of him?

860
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:43,869
Where? On the street?

861
01:02:43,939 --> 01:02:46,669
A few times. You know, outside stuff.

862
01:02:46,942 --> 01:02:50,969
Someone working for a guy who worked
for a guy who got money from Soze.

863
01:02:51,046 --> 01:02:52,638
Shit like that.

864
01:02:53,415 --> 01:02:55,713
It could be an old badge. A hex sign.

865
01:02:55,784 --> 01:02:58,878
Keep people from fucking with you
when a name meant something.

866
01:02:58,954 --> 01:03:00,888
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

867
01:03:01,123 --> 01:03:05,719
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital
because he's so afraid of Soze.

868
01:03:06,061 --> 01:03:08,120
I'll run it up the flagpole.

869
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:12,090
I came clean. I told it like it happened.

870
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:13,691
So what about how I got there?

871
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:16,932
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to forget amnesty.

872
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,235
You got what you wanted out of me.
Big deal.

873
01:03:19,308 --> 01:03:22,141
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me.

874
01:03:22,311 --> 01:03:25,576
If I told you the Loch Ness monster
hired me, what would you say?

875
01:03:25,647 --> 01:03:27,911
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

876
01:03:27,983 --> 01:03:30,474
I've got immunity.
What can you possibly offer me?

877
01:03:30,586 --> 01:03:34,181
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come lookin' for you.

878
01:03:34,656 --> 01:03:35,987
Where's your head?

879
01:03:36,492 --> 01:03:38,323
Where do you think the pressure is?

880
01:03:38,393 --> 01:03:41,590
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him,
knows where I am right now.

881
01:03:41,797 --> 01:03:45,824
He has the burner on your ass to let me go
so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

882
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:48,160
Immunity was just a deal
with you assholes.

883
01:03:48,237 --> 01:03:50,137
I got a new problem when I post bail.

884
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,696
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

885
01:03:53,742 --> 01:03:57,041
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion.

886
01:03:57,112 --> 01:03:59,239
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

887
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:02,681
The same fuckers that rounded us up
are now bailing me out?

888
01:04:02,751 --> 01:04:04,412
Fuck you.

889
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:08,789
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

890
01:04:08,857 --> 01:04:11,917
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught...

891
01:04:11,994 --> 01:04:13,518
...and sticks his head out?

892
01:04:13,662 --> 01:04:16,426
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

893
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:18,357
After that...

894
01:04:18,734 --> 01:04:21,760
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

895
01:04:43,725 --> 01:04:45,420
What happened next?

896
01:04:45,694 --> 01:04:48,356
We woke up the next morning
and Fenster was gone.

897
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:50,955
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

898
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,134
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

899
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:55,966
...and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

900
01:04:56,071 --> 01:04:57,197
Then what?

901
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:58,872
McManus was furious.

902
01:04:58,941 --> 01:05:03,173
He talked about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

903
01:05:03,946 --> 01:05:06,039
That night, we got the call.

904
01:05:06,448 --> 01:05:07,676
What call?

905
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:10,283
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

906
01:05:18,427 --> 01:05:20,725
Let's get the fuck out of here.

907
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:23,855
We gotta bury him.

908
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:25,397
With what?

909
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,358
With our hands.

910
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:38,611
This is nuts.

911
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,871
It's dry fucking sand.

912
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:44,407
When he rots the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

913
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:46,578
- Dig, you fuck.
- What are we gonna do?

914
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:48,555
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

915
01:05:48,624 --> 01:05:52,458
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

916
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:56,525
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

917
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,263
You run, and we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you.

918
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:01,802
You got that?

919
01:06:02,437 --> 01:06:05,804
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

920
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:10,371
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

921
01:06:10,612 --> 01:06:14,048
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count.

922
01:06:14,116 --> 01:06:15,515
So fuck you!

923
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:19,211
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

924
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,589
It's precaution.

925
01:06:23,992 --> 01:06:26,961
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

926
01:06:29,931 --> 01:06:32,161
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

927
01:06:32,901 --> 01:06:34,892
I'm not doin' it for you.

928
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,236
I'm doin' this for me.

929
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,942
I'm gonna finish this thing.

930
01:06:42,644 --> 01:06:45,841
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

931
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:09,196
After they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

932
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:13,207
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
- Why didn't you say anything?

933
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:15,903
Believe me, I tried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

934
01:07:15,977 --> 01:07:18,002
It was too far-fetched for him.

935
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,378
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

936
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:23,384
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

937
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:25,044
It's always simple.

938
01:07:25,153 --> 01:07:27,713
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal.

939
01:07:27,789 --> 01:07:31,555
You got a body and think
his brother did it, you're probably right.

940
01:07:31,626 --> 01:07:33,116
Nobody argued with Keaton.

941
01:07:33,195 --> 01:07:35,891
They just set their minds
to whacking Kobayashi.

942
01:07:45,807 --> 01:07:47,138
They're coming up.

943
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:53,040
- Did you hear me? He's coming up.
- He's on his way down.

944
01:08:49,738 --> 01:08:51,103
Don't move.

945
01:08:51,807 --> 01:08:53,536
Press 20. Do it now.

946
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:14,954
Move.

947
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:21,233
- The answer is "no."
- Mr.Soze will be most--

948
01:09:21,303 --> 01:09:23,567
Listen, cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

949
01:09:23,638 --> 01:09:26,106
Mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

950
01:09:26,174 --> 01:09:30,042
A strange threat. I assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

951
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:37,950
We know that you can get to us...

952
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,687
...but now you know
that we can get to you.

953
01:09:42,224 --> 01:09:45,250
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

954
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:48,719
My employer has made up his mind.

955
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:51,957
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.

956
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,967
You got Fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us.

957
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:57,334
Not before one of us gets through to you.

958
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:00,533
I believe you. I most sincerely do.

959
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:04,139
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

960
01:10:04,212 --> 01:10:08,171
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is...

961
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,083
...ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me...

962
01:10:11,152 --> 01:10:13,780
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

963
01:10:21,229 --> 01:10:23,720
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

964
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,630
I just wanted you to know that.

965
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:30,561
I'm so sorry.

966
01:10:31,072 --> 01:10:33,563
I implore you, believe me...

967
01:10:33,975 --> 01:10:35,966
...Mr.Soze is very real...

968
01:10:36,344 --> 01:10:38,835
- ...and very determined.
- We'll see.

969
01:10:46,288 --> 01:10:49,655
Before you do me in...

970
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,094
...you will let me finish my business
with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

971
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:00,557
What did you say?

972
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:03,228
Edie Finneran.

973
01:11:03,505 --> 01:11:05,530
She's upstairs in my office...

974
01:11:06,107 --> 01:11:08,302
...for an extradition deposition.

975
01:11:09,344 --> 01:11:12,177
I requested she be
put on the case personally.

976
01:11:12,247 --> 01:11:14,044
She flew in yesterday.

977
01:11:16,051 --> 01:11:17,382
No matter.

978
01:11:17,852 --> 01:11:19,717
Kill away.

979
01:11:24,559 --> 01:11:26,026
You're lying.

980
01:11:26,595 --> 01:11:27,687
Am I?

981
01:11:45,113 --> 01:11:48,742
Miss Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

982
01:11:48,817 --> 01:11:50,478
Never leaves her for a moment.

983
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:53,377
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

984
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,957
Get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

985
01:12:01,096 --> 01:12:03,656
If I see you or any
of your friends before then...

986
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:08,567
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of
a most gruesome violation before she dies.

987
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,137
As indeed will your father, Mr.Hockney...

988
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:14,573
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr.Kint.

989
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:18,910
I might only castrate
Mr.McManus' nephew, David.

990
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:23,816
Do I make myself clear?

991
01:12:24,285 --> 01:12:26,753
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

992
01:12:26,821 --> 01:12:29,051
We'll add them to the cost of Mr.Fenster.

993
01:12:29,924 --> 01:12:32,154
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

994
01:13:10,365 --> 01:13:12,458
It's a logistical nightmare.

995
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,364
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

996
01:13:16,004 --> 01:13:18,939
There's no tellin'
how many more are gonna be below deck.

997
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:21,271
Can we stealth these guys?

998
01:13:21,643 --> 01:13:24,840
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

999
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,012
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

1000
01:13:28,683 --> 01:13:32,210
Even if one of us gets through
and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

1001
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:34,016
What if we wait for the money?

1002
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:36,353
Ten more men at least.

1003
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:39,992
In my opinion, it can't be done.

1004
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:42,592
Anyone who goes in
is not comin' out alive.

1005
01:13:42,664 --> 01:13:45,633
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.

1006
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,192
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

1007
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:50,498
Me, too.

1008
01:13:52,006 --> 01:13:53,906
There's nothing that can't be done.

1009
01:13:57,045 --> 01:14:00,742
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk in to certain death.

1010
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:09,583
The news said it's raining in New York.

1011
01:14:31,212 --> 01:14:32,839
What language is that?

1012
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:36,210
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1013
01:14:38,153 --> 01:14:39,484
Hungarian?

1014
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:46,119
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1015
01:16:06,107 --> 01:16:07,233
You kids ready?

1016
01:16:08,142 --> 01:16:10,804
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

1017
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:12,276
I'm ready.

1018
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,381
McManus, you better be set up
in 10 seconds.

1019
01:16:17,352 --> 01:16:18,444
I'm ready.

1020
01:16:20,154 --> 01:16:21,553
I want you to stay here.

1021
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:24,289
I'm supposed to cover--

1022
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:27,157
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

1023
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:28,320
I can't--

1024
01:16:28,396 --> 01:16:30,762
Find Edie.
Tell her everything that happened.

1025
01:16:30,832 --> 01:16:32,891
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1026
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:35,993
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1027
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:38,561
- What if I--
- Just do what I say.

1028
01:16:39,207 --> 01:16:40,401
Please.

1029
01:16:43,745 --> 01:16:45,337
Tell her that...

1030
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,577
Tell her I tried.

1031
01:17:03,765 --> 01:17:06,256
McManus, he's on his way.

1032
01:17:06,634 --> 01:17:07,965
I'm there.

1033
01:18:00,054 --> 01:18:03,820
One, two, three, four...

1034
01:18:04,459 --> 01:18:07,087
...five, six, seven...

1035
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:10,190
Oswald was a fag.

1036
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:19,630
Hi.

1037
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:21,865
How you doin'?

1038
01:18:24,712 --> 01:18:27,044
Is there a problem?

1039
01:18:52,607 --> 01:18:53,596
Now.

1040
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:27,035
"Old McDonald had a farm

1041
01:19:27,108 --> 01:19:29,668
"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O

1042
01:19:30,244 --> 01:19:34,544
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

1043
01:20:08,249 --> 01:20:09,773
Elvis has left the building.

1044
01:21:21,022 --> 01:21:23,684
Hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!

1045
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:38,532
Hello.

1046
01:22:32,927 --> 01:22:34,292
Why didn't you run?

1047
01:22:35,129 --> 01:22:36,494
I froze up.

1048
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:40,598
I thought about Fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

1049
01:22:40,668 --> 01:22:44,764
Then I thought about Keaton,
and it looked like he might pull it off.

1050
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:53,106
A boy found a body on the beach today.

1051
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:55,614
Thrown clear of the boat.
Shot twice in the head.

1052
01:22:55,683 --> 01:22:57,617
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

1053
01:22:57,685 --> 01:22:59,846
- What else?
- His name was Arturo Marquez.

1054
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,854
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1055
01:23:01,922 --> 01:23:04,789
He was arrested last year in New York
for trafficking.

1056
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:08,625
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1057
01:23:08,696 --> 01:23:12,097
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1058
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:13,463
Now, get this.

1059
01:23:13,534 --> 01:23:17,163
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1060
01:23:17,238 --> 01:23:18,500
Kobayashi.

1061
01:23:18,572 --> 01:23:20,767
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony.

1062
01:23:20,841 --> 01:23:23,401
- He was a rat.
- A big fucking rat.

1063
01:23:23,477 --> 01:23:26,241
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1064
01:23:26,314 --> 01:23:30,216
So much so,
that he named close to 50 people.

1065
01:23:30,451 --> 01:23:32,783
Guess who he named in the finale.

1066
01:23:33,788 --> 01:23:35,187
Keyser Soze.

1067
01:23:35,523 --> 01:23:36,820
There's more.

1068
01:23:49,203 --> 01:23:53,503
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1069
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:57,105
There was no dope on that boat.

1070
01:24:38,986 --> 01:24:40,317
You, stay quiet.

1071
01:24:40,554 --> 01:24:41,885
He's here.

1072
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:46,256
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1073
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,087
I know he's here!

1074
01:24:49,697 --> 01:24:52,757
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.

1075
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:57,202
That's him. You hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1076
01:26:55,489 --> 01:26:57,457
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

1077
01:26:57,525 --> 01:26:59,117
There's no coke.

1078
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,260
- What?
- You heard me, dumb fuck.

1079
01:27:01,328 --> 01:27:03,626
- There's no coke!
- What the fuck? No coke?

1080
01:27:03,697 --> 01:27:06,325
I've been up and down
in every fucking room.

1081
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,698
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1082
01:27:08,769 --> 01:27:09,997
Nothing!

1083
01:27:10,504 --> 01:27:11,903
Don't you fuck with me.

1084
01:27:12,106 --> 01:27:15,940
There is no fucking coke!

1085
01:27:27,054 --> 01:27:28,646
I'm out of here.

1086
01:28:09,563 --> 01:28:11,326
I told them nothing.

1087
01:28:12,499 --> 01:28:13,659
I swear.

1088
01:28:14,401 --> 01:28:16,995
I told them nothing. Please.

1089
01:29:03,317 --> 01:29:06,184
What the fuck is goin' on?

1090
01:29:08,922 --> 01:29:10,685
The strangest thing.

1091
01:30:05,312 --> 01:30:08,577
That's what you said.
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1092
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:10,173
Wait a minute.

1093
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:12,275
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1094
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:15,844
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- I know there was dope on that boat.

1095
01:30:15,923 --> 01:30:17,447
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not.

1096
01:30:17,524 --> 01:30:20,186
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1097
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:23,093
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.

1098
01:30:23,163 --> 01:30:24,824
You know what I'm getting at.

1099
01:30:24,898 --> 01:30:27,423
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!

1100
01:30:27,501 --> 01:30:29,696
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1101
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:30,794
I did.

1102
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:32,236
You're lying to me.

1103
01:30:32,306 --> 01:30:35,764
- You've known this whole time.
- I don't know what you're saying.

1104
01:30:35,843 --> 01:30:38,471
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.

1105
01:30:38,579 --> 01:30:41,139
Why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1106
01:30:41,281 --> 01:30:43,112
He was your friend.

1107
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:48,817
Because I was afraid.

1108
01:30:51,058 --> 01:30:53,618
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1109
01:30:54,795 --> 01:30:56,922
- Afraid of--
- I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1110
01:30:57,264 --> 01:31:01,166
It was Keyser Soze, I mean,
the Devil himself.

1111
01:31:02,469 --> 01:31:05,097
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1112
01:31:09,576 --> 01:31:11,203
What if you miss?

1113
01:31:16,316 --> 01:31:18,807
Let's get back to the pier.

1114
01:32:41,668 --> 01:32:45,069
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

1115
01:32:45,205 --> 01:32:47,833
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

1116
01:32:47,908 --> 01:32:50,274
He swore out a statement
to federal marshals...

1117
01:32:50,344 --> 01:32:53,711
...saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one...

1118
01:32:53,814 --> 01:32:55,076
...Keyser Soze.

1119
01:32:55,549 --> 01:32:57,312
It says right here in the report.

1120
01:32:57,384 --> 01:33:00,182
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses, including...

1121
01:33:00,254 --> 01:33:03,417
...but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

1122
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:05,014
I never heard of him.

1123
01:33:05,092 --> 01:33:07,925
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

1124
01:33:07,995 --> 01:33:11,658
Most likely the same Hungarians
that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1125
01:33:11,999 --> 01:33:13,660
The money wasn't there for dope.

1126
01:33:13,734 --> 01:33:16,032
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy...

1127
01:33:16,103 --> 01:33:18,264
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1128
01:33:18,672 --> 01:33:21,140
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1129
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:24,268
Edie Finneran was Marquez's
extradition advisor.

1130
01:33:24,344 --> 01:33:26,539
She knew who he was and what he knew.

1131
01:33:26,813 --> 01:33:30,010
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit.

1132
01:33:30,284 --> 01:33:32,752
A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1133
01:33:32,853 --> 01:33:34,912
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1134
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:37,154
So Soze put some thieves to it...

1135
01:33:37,557 --> 01:33:39,923
...men he knew he could march
into certain death.

1136
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,785
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1137
01:33:44,031 --> 01:33:47,057
I'm saying Keaton did.
He left you behind for a reason.

1138
01:33:47,134 --> 01:33:48,692
Just do what I tell you.

1139
01:33:48,769 --> 01:33:51,932
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1140
01:33:52,005 --> 01:33:53,996
...why did he give you the money to run?

1141
01:33:54,074 --> 01:33:57,373
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1142
01:33:59,012 --> 01:34:01,640
A one-time dirty cop without
a loyalty in the world...

1143
01:34:01,715 --> 01:34:05,048
...finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple?

1144
01:34:05,118 --> 01:34:06,585
No, sir. Why?

1145
01:34:07,321 --> 01:34:08,345
Edie.

1146
01:34:08,422 --> 01:34:11,050
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.

1147
01:34:11,124 --> 01:34:12,455
Even if I did...

1148
01:34:12,526 --> 01:34:16,121
...I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1149
01:34:16,463 --> 01:34:17,657
So why?

1150
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,931
Because he was my friend.

1151
01:34:22,002 --> 01:34:25,938
No, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1152
01:34:26,006 --> 01:34:27,473
What are you doing here?

1153
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:30,271
He saved you
because he wanted it that way.

1154
01:34:30,344 --> 01:34:31,470
It was his will.

1155
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:34,707
- Keaton was Keyser Soze.
- No.

1156
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:38,342
A man who could wrangle the wills
of men like Hockney and McManus.

1157
01:34:38,418 --> 01:34:40,943
A man who could engineer a police lineup...

1158
01:34:41,021 --> 01:34:43,785
...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1159
01:34:43,857 --> 01:34:46,382
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1160
01:34:51,398 --> 01:34:54,231
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

1161
01:34:54,301 --> 01:34:56,166
...shot twice in the head.

1162
01:35:01,074 --> 01:35:03,907
What do you think about Keaton now?

1163
01:35:05,212 --> 01:35:06,201
Edie?

1164
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:08,509
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1165
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:11,983
He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself...

1166
01:35:12,052 --> 01:35:13,952
...to make sure he got his man...

1167
01:35:14,054 --> 01:35:16,113
...the one man that could identify him.

1168
01:35:17,224 --> 01:35:18,851
This is all bullshit.

1169
01:35:19,092 --> 01:35:21,060
You said you saw him die.

1170
01:35:23,463 --> 01:35:24,487
Or did you?

1171
01:35:24,664 --> 01:35:27,030
You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

1172
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,500
You said you heard the shot
before the fire...

1173
01:35:29,970 --> 01:35:31,995
...but you didn't see him die.

1174
01:35:32,272 --> 01:35:35,070
- I knew him. He would never--
- He programmed you.

1175
01:35:35,142 --> 01:35:37,770
He programmed you to tell us
what he wanted you to.

1176
01:35:37,844 --> 01:35:40,074
He knew we were close.
You said it yourself.

1177
01:35:40,147 --> 01:35:43,173
Where was the political pressure
to protect you from?

1178
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:44,474
It was Keaton.

1179
01:35:44,551 --> 01:35:47,884
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1180
01:35:48,455 --> 01:35:50,548
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1181
01:35:50,624 --> 01:35:53,320
Why me? I'm stupid.
I'm a cripple. Why me?

1182
01:35:53,393 --> 01:35:54,826
Because you're a cripple.

1183
01:35:55,362 --> 01:35:57,057
Because you're stupid.

1184
01:35:57,330 --> 01:35:59,264
Because you're weaker than them.

1185
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:04,867
If he's dead...

1186
01:36:05,305 --> 01:36:09,207
If what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1187
01:36:10,744 --> 01:36:13,611
It was his idea to hit the taxi service,
wasn't it?

1188
01:36:13,713 --> 01:36:16,876
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1189
01:36:18,185 --> 01:36:20,710
We followed him from the beginning.

1190
01:36:22,489 --> 01:36:23,649
I didn't know.

1191
01:36:24,157 --> 01:36:25,886
I saw him die.

1192
01:36:26,726 --> 01:36:29,718
I believe he's dead. Christ.

1193
01:36:30,964 --> 01:36:32,761
You're not safe on your own.

1194
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:38,098
You think he's...

1195
01:36:38,405 --> 01:36:39,997
Keyser Soze?

1196
01:36:40,774 --> 01:36:42,401
I don't know.

1197
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:47,869
Keyser Soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

1198
01:36:48,949 --> 01:36:52,578
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1199
01:36:53,353 --> 01:36:56,789
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.

1200
01:36:57,057 --> 01:36:58,490
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1201
01:36:59,059 --> 01:37:01,118
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

1202
01:37:01,394 --> 01:37:04,363
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.

1203
01:37:04,698 --> 01:37:08,395
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1204
01:37:08,468 --> 01:37:11,869
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1205
01:37:11,938 --> 01:37:13,132
Maybe so.

1206
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:16,608
But I'm not a rat.

1207
01:37:33,393 --> 01:37:34,951
Fuckin' cops.

1208
01:37:59,419 --> 01:38:02,013
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1209
01:38:05,992 --> 01:38:08,688
You'll have to sign for these, Mr.Kint.

1210
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:12,422
One watch, gold.

1211
01:38:12,933 --> 01:38:15,026
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1212
01:38:15,902 --> 01:38:17,893
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1213
01:38:18,505 --> 01:38:20,530
We still got nothing.

1214
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,104
I know what I wanted to know
about Keaton.

1215
01:38:23,176 --> 01:38:24,803
Which is nothing.

1216
01:38:25,312 --> 01:38:28,873
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1217
01:38:29,382 --> 01:38:31,976
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1218
01:38:32,352 --> 01:38:35,287
...if Keaton is alive,
he's not comin' up again.

1219
01:38:35,722 --> 01:38:37,519
I'll find him.

1220
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:39,481
Waste of time.

1221
01:38:42,295 --> 01:38:44,627
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1222
01:38:45,098 --> 01:38:46,224
What?

1223
01:38:47,334 --> 01:38:48,301
Nothing.

1224
01:38:50,337 --> 01:38:52,168
Man, you're a slob.

1225
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:54,571
But it all has a system.

1226
01:38:55,442 --> 01:38:59,879
It all makes sense if you look at it right.
You gotta stand back from it.

1227
01:39:01,181 --> 01:39:04,275
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1228
01:39:41,621 --> 01:39:43,680
Convince me. Tell me every last...

1229
01:39:43,757 --> 01:39:46,749
When I was in that barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois...

1230
01:39:46,826 --> 01:39:50,387
- Where's your head?
- We need to think, think back.

1231
01:39:50,463 --> 01:39:52,090
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.

1232
01:39:52,165 --> 01:39:53,723
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.

1233
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:56,233
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

1234
01:39:56,303 --> 01:39:59,761
- I'm tellin' it straight.
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

1235
01:39:59,839 --> 01:40:02,330
- A gift from Mr.Soze.
- Talk to me.

1236
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:05,469
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

1237
01:40:05,545 --> 01:40:08,514
- Using pawns...
- A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.

1238
01:40:08,581 --> 01:40:10,310
There was a lawyer...

1239
01:40:10,684 --> 01:40:12,083
Kobayashi...

1240
01:40:12,519 --> 01:40:15,647
When I was picking beans
in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.

1241
01:40:15,789 --> 01:40:18,724
- I know you thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.

1242
01:40:21,127 --> 01:40:24,028
- You tell me every last detail.
- The strangest thing.

1243
01:40:24,097 --> 01:40:26,031
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1244
01:40:26,099 --> 01:40:29,330
This guy is protected from up
on high by the Prince of...

1245
01:40:29,436 --> 01:40:31,734
What's your story, pretzel man?

1246
01:40:31,805 --> 01:40:33,636
- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer?

1247
01:40:33,707 --> 01:40:34,867
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

1248
01:40:34,941 --> 01:40:38,468
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.

1249
01:40:38,545 --> 01:40:41,776
- I work for Keyser Soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.

1250
01:40:57,063 --> 01:40:59,691
Every creep and scumbag
that works the street...

1251
01:40:59,766 --> 01:41:01,859
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1252
01:41:02,502 --> 01:41:03,992
The cripple, did you see him?

1253
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:07,164
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- He went out that way.

1254
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,834
I know you know something.
I know you're not telling...

1255
01:41:09,909 --> 01:41:11,069
I'm smarter than you...

1256
01:41:11,144 --> 01:41:13,635
...and I'm gonna find out
whether you like it or not.

1257
01:41:13,713 --> 01:41:15,613
To a cop, the explanation
is never complicated.

1258
01:41:15,682 --> 01:41:17,274
- It's always simple.
- The truth!

1259
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:20,285
There's no arch-criminal behind it all.

1260
01:41:20,353 --> 01:41:23,186
Somebody with power,
somebody who is capable...

1261
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:24,982
Keyser Soze!

1262
01:41:25,759 --> 01:41:29,024
You think a guy like that
gets this close to getting caught...

1263
01:41:29,162 --> 01:41:31,130
...and sticks his head out?

1264
01:41:32,031 --> 01:41:35,057
Because you're stupid.
Because you're a cripple.

1265
01:41:35,135 --> 01:41:37,296
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?

1266
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:39,702
You've known the whole fuckin' time.

1267
01:41:39,773 --> 01:41:43,402
If he comes up for anything
it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.

1268
01:41:43,476 --> 01:41:46,468
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1269
01:41:46,646 --> 01:41:49,046
First thing I learned on the job.
You know what?

1270
01:41:49,182 --> 01:41:52,640
- How to spot a murderer.
- You got the cripple in there?

1271
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,483
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?

1272
01:41:55,722 --> 01:41:57,246
After that...

1273
01:41:57,724 --> 01:42:00,750
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

1274
01:42:21,281 --> 01:42:23,579
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

1275
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:26,480
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1276
01:42:28,354 --> 01:42:29,514
And like that...

1277
01:42:31,224 --> 01:42:32,555
...he's gone.
