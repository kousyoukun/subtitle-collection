1
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,924
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,305
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,767
Keyser.

4
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,647
Ready?

5
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,493
What time is it?

6
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,127
Twelve-thirty.

7
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,605
It all started back in New York six weeks ago.

8
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,985
A truck of stripped guns parts got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,488
The driver didn't see anybody, but he heard a voice.

10
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,198
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,498
- Mr. McManus.
- Don't you guys ever fucking sleep?

12
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,710
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

13
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,969
Todd Hockney?

14
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,598
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

15
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,855
- Shit!
- Police! Hold it!

16
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,321
Sure you brought enough guys?

17
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,982
It's quite simple,

18
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,904
a restaurant that changes with taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

19
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,242
On other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

20
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,411
Let me give you an example.

21
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,747
This I had to see for myself.

22
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,879
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

23
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,258
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

24
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,969
Special Agent Kujan, US Customs.

25
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,222
And the New York Police Dept.

26
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,809
You look good, Keaton.

27
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:19,147
- You have a problem, Mr. Keaton?
- A stolen truck loaded with guns.

28
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,904
Will you excuse us for a moment?

29
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,742
We have some questions. It's going to be some time.

30
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,163
No, no, please sit down.

31
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,500
This is a small problem.

32
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,544
Enjoy the meal.

33
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,129
Talk to you later.

34
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:09,531
<i>It didn't make sense I was there.
They were hard-core hijackers.</i>

35
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,242
<i>But there I was.</i>

36
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:19,374
<i>I wasn't scared. I hadn't done anything they could do me for.</i>

37
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:24,838
<i>Besides, it was fun. I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

38
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,759
<i>When your number is called,</i>

39
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,929
<i>step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given.</i>

40
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,015
<i>Number 1, step forward.</i>

41
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,897
Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.

42
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,485
<i>Number 2, step forward.</i>

43
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,199
Give me the fucking keys, you fucking cocksucker motherfucker!

44
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,286
<i>Knock it off. Number 3.</i>

45
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,757
- Hand me the keys, cocksucker.
<i>- In English, please.</i>

46
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,135
- Excuse me?
<i>- In English.</i>

47
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,055
Hand me the fucking keys, you cocksucker. What the fuck?

48
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,558
<i>Number 4, step forward.</i>

49
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,686
<i>It was bull shit. The whole rap was a setup.</i>

50
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,647
Hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker.

51
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:28,110
<i>It was the cops' fault. You don't put guys like that together.</i>

52
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,821
<i>Who knows what can happen?</i>

53
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,783
Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.

54
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,160
<i>This has got to be</i>

55
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:38,996
embarrassing for you guys.

56
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>They drilled us all night. The cops had nothing.</i>

57
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,628
<i>They hoped somebody'd slip up.</i>

58
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,966
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight it. They knew how to lean on us.</i>

59
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,928
<i>Our rights went out the window, it was disgraceful.</i>

60
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,723
<i>They went after McManus first. Top-knotch entry man.</i>

61
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,518
- What truck?
- The truck with the guns, fucko.

62
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,604
Fucko?

63
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,483
<i>He was a good guy. Crazy, though.</i>

64
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,527
Want to know what Fenster said?

65
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,323
McManus told us another story.

66
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,910
Was that the one about the hooker with dysentery?

67
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:21,246
<i>Fenster always worked with McManus.</i>

68
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,541
<i>When it came to the job he was right on. A smart man.</i>

69
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,294
- What are you saying?
- I said you're flip here.

70
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,422
- What?
- Flip here, flipping for real.

71
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,007
I'm shaking. Come on.

72
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,469
- Answer my question.
- Can you hear me at the back?

73
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:42,643
I want my lawyer. I'll have your badge, cocksucker.

74
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,021
<i>Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.</i>

75
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,775
<i>The one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i>

76
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:54,071
- You don't have a leg to stand on.
- You think so, tough guy?

77
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,573
You were in Queens on the night of the highjacking.

78
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,117
Really? I live in Queens.

79
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:04,498
Did you put that together, Einstein? You got a team of monkeys?

80
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,417
You know what happens if you do another turn in the joint?

81
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,882
Fuck your father in the shower. You gonna charge me, dickhead?

82
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,717
I'll charge you when I'm ready.

83
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,637
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

84
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,391
<i>Keaton was the real prize for them, for obvious reasons.</i>

85
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,102
It was your mistake, not mine.

86
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,148
Did you ever stop to ask me?

87
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:35,487
I have the same face, the same name.

88
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,158
- I'm a businessman.
- The restaurant business?

89
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,329
From now on, you're in the getting-fucked-by-us business.

90
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,500
- I'm going to make you famous.
- Like I said,

91
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,462
it was your mistake, not mine.

92
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:58,051
Charge me with this shit, and I'll beat it.

93
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,554
Okay?

94
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,765
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

95
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:10,355
I hold someone's shit for five minutes.

96
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,692
So I did a little time. Does that mean I get railed

97
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,653
every time a truck loses its way?

98
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,197
Fuck 'em!

99
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:22,784
Fenster, will you relax? They don't have probable cause.

100
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,163
Fucking-A right. No PC.

101
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,415
You do some time, they never let you go.

102
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,459
They treat me like a criminal.

103
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,669
I'll end up a criminal.

104
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,338
You are a criminal.

105
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,593
What you got to do that? I'm trying to make a point.

106
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:43,847
Why don't you make your point? You're making me tired all over.

107
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,849
Fuck it, then.

108
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,976
I heard you were dead.

109
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,937
You heard right.

110
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,855
Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

111
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,524
What's that all about?

112
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,067
What's this?

113
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,444
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.

114
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,364
I hear he's tapping Edie Finnerman.

115
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:01,406
Who's that?

116
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:05,744
A big uptown criminal lawyer. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

117
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,623
How about it? You a lawyer's wife?

118
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,709
What retainer are you giving her?

119
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,796
Fenster,

120
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,048
do your friend a favor.

121
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,634
Tell him to keep quiet.

122
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,345
Dean Keaton.

123
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,350
Gone clean, huh? Say it ain't so.

124
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,937
- Or did you hit the truck?
- Mac, forget him.

125
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,189
Did you talk to your lawyer?

126
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,150
This was a shakedown.

127
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,696
- What makes you say that?
- You've been in a lineup.

128
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,615
It's always you and four dummies.

129
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:47,411
The P.D. Pays homeless guys ten bucks a head.

130
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,956
No way they'd line five felons in a row. No way.

131
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,918
A voice lineup? A public defender could get you out of that.

132
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,088
- So why was I strip-searched?
- It was the Feds.

133
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,841
A truckload of guns gets snagged,

134
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:04,928
Customs goes to NYPD, they come up with us.

135
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,432
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my asshole.

136
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:09,766
Is it Friday already?

137
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,103
Yeah, lover boy.

138
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,564
You want a piece?

139
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,860
Who are the pigs stole our fucking truck?

140
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:24,114
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

141
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,657
I don't want to know.

142
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,995
- Who asked you, working man?
- Fuck who did it. Who's the gimp?

143
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,414
- He's okay.
- Says you.

144
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,916
What about it, pretzel man?

145
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,043
- What's your story?
- His name is Verbal.

146
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:37,920
Verbal Kint.

147
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,758
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

148
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,968
I was going to tell you to shut up.

149
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,637
We met before once or twice.

150
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,764
I was in county for fraud.

151
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,891
In a lineup. What happened?

152
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,227
I walked.

153
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,479
- 90 days suspended.
- So you did it!

154
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,855
All right, look.

155
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,776
We've been put out by this.

156
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,655
I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity.

157
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,990
Now...

158
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,076
Me and Fenster heard about a job.

159
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,702
Why don't you just calm down?

160
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,247
What do you care what he says?

161
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,124
I'm just talking here.

162
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:21,505
Mr. Hockney wants to hear, and I know Fenster's down.

163
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,924
What about you, guy?

164
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,261
I'm interested, sure.

165
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,513
There. See?

166
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,808
So I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly.

167
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,143
Why don't you just shut up?

168
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,818
You're missing the point.

169
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,905
No. You're missing the point.

170
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,200
I don't want to hear anything from you.

171
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,536
I don't care about your job.

172
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,747
And...

173
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,628
I want nothing to do with any of you. I beg your pardon,

174
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,298
but you can all go to hell.

175
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,010
Dean Keaton,

176
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,429
gone the high road.

177
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,141
What is the world coming to?

178
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,397
Fuck him.

179
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,403
<i>And that was how it started.</i>

180
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,949
<i>The five of us on a trumped-up
charge to be leaned on by halfwits.</i>

181
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,330
I can't talk about much here.

182
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,875
<i>What the cops didn't figure out and what I know now,</i>

183
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,837
<i>was these men would never break.</i>

184
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,715
<i>Never bend over for anybody.</i>

185
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,635
<i>Anybody.</i>

186
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,320
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

187
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,991
- How many dead?
- 15. They're still finding bodies.

188
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,619
- Any survivors?
- Yeah, there's two.

189
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,205
One's in hospital in a coma.

190
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,625
The D.A. Has the second, a cripple from New York.

191
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:26,505
The chief wants this place sealed off. Call him.

192
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,418
<i>This is David Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

193
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,547
<i>If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin, San Pedro PD,</i>

194
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,424
<i>on extension 112.</i>

195
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,509
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

196
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,015
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you.

197
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:23,020
The DA came down here last night, ready to arraign before they moved him to county.

198
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:28,358
Kint's lawyers comes and the DA. Comes out looking smacked around.

199
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,154
They take his statement and cut him a deal.

200
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:36,408
- Did they charge him?
- Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanor 2.

201
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,410
What is that?

202
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:43,540
- I give the DA credit for that.
- Excuse me, sir.

203
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:49,880
It's turned political. The Mayor and Chief were here last night.

204
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,549
This morning, the Governor called.

205
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:57,846
This guy is protected from on high by the Prince of Darkness.

206
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,849
- When does he post bail?
- Two hours, tops.

207
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,727
- I want to see him.
- No.

208
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,981
- I cannot do this for you.
- I came a long way for this.

209
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,068
Dave, please.

210
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,407
Even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you.

211
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:22,746
He's paranoid. He knows the interrogation rooms are wired.

212
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,375
I quit. It won't be an interrogation, just a friendly chat.

213
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,627
He won't go in there.

214
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,504
- Then someplace else.
- Where?

215
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:37,886
Where is the dope? If it was a hit, who called it in?

216
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,849
I'm sure you have wild theories to answer all these questions.

217
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,977
- You know what I think.
- It doesn't even matter.

218
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,021
The guy's got total immunity. His story checks out.

219
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,607
He doesn't know what you want to know.

220
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,568
I don't think he does, exactly.

221
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,945
There's more to his story.

222
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,408
I want to know why 27 men died on that pier...

223
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:03,662
for 91 million dollars of dope that wasn't there.

224
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:07,624
Above all, I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

225
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,334
He's dead.

226
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,337
Come on, two hours. Just till he makes bail.

227
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,548
They're all dead.

228
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,927
I don't care how tough Keaton was.
Nobody could've survived that boat.

229
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,308
Is he talking?

230
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,520
He regained consciousness, he spoke, not English, and lapsed.

231
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,939
- Hungarian.
- I don't know, maybe.

232
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,691
Most of them were Hungarians.

233
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,445
- You've got to put this on.
- Burns victims catch infections.

234
00:20:37,196 --> 00:20:39,698
And of course there's no smoking.

235
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,002
Keep your mask up. Please don't touch him.

236
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:52,920
Is he going to die?

237
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,131
He's got burns on 60% of his body and broken ribs.

238
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:00,093
- Get a man put on the door.
- Is he dangerous?

239
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,094
Yes.

240
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,513
Do it.

241
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,389
Do it now.

242
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,728
Yeah, Baer. Down at LA County.

243
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:14,107
The guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

244
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,654
Nah, he's all fucked up.

245
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,949
I can't hear you.

246
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,618
Shut up. I'm on the phone.

247
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:28,956
Send me

248
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,749
someone who can speak Hungarian.

249
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,418
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

250
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,339
What?

251
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,882
Keyser Soze!

252
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,222
No shit.

253
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:52,479
Call Dan Metzheiser at Justice and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

254
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,433
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

255
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,146
- Nice to meet you.
- He want to ask some questions.

256
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,858
- What about?
- About Dean Keaton mostly.

257
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,236
I'd like to start with the lineup back in New York.

258
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:45,073
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. What about the lineup?

259
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm really thirsty. I used to dehydrate as a kid.

260
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,039
Once my piss came out like snot. I was all thick and...

261
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:55,751
- I'll get your fucking coffee.
- Get me one too.

262
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,551
That guy is tense. Tension is a killer.

263
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,471
I used to be in a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.

264
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:11,808
The baritone was this fat guy named Kip Diskin.

265
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,479
- He got so stressed in the morning.
- We're trying to help you.

266
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,483
I appreciate that and I want to help you, Agent Kujan.

267
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,529
I like cops. I would've been a fed...

268
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,699
You're not telling everything. I know you know something.

269
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,452
<i>I told the DA everything.</i>

270
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,416
<i>I know you like Keaton and you think he's a good man.</i>

271
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,586
<i>- I know he was good.
- He was a corrupt cop.</i>

272
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,756
<i>Sure, fifteen years ago. But he was a good thief.</i>

273
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,342
Cops wouldn't let him go legit.

274
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,135
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

275
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,600
Are you trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?

276
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:57,020
- I just want to hear your story.
- It's all there.

277
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,106
May I have a cigarette?

278
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,862
- According to your statement...
- I need a light.

279
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,119
According to your statement you're a short con operator.

280
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,128
According to your statement you're a short con operator.

281
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,047
Run of the mill scams.

282
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:27,634
- That's suppressed, inadmissible.
- I know.

283
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,512
Sweet deal you have here. Total immunity.

284
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:34,766
I do have the weapons charge.

285
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,102
I'm looking at 6 months hard time.

286
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,313
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

287
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,816
You know a religious guy named John Paul?

288
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,819
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

289
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:49,865
I know Ruby. He's big on respect. He's a friend, he likes me.

290
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,534
I know your testimony's sealed,

291
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,746
but Ruby's got lots of friends inside.

292
00:24:56,246 --> 00:25:00,375
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

293
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,587
- There's nothing there about Ruby.
- I'll mention that to him.

294
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,840
First thing I learned on the job was how to spot a murderer.

295
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:10,969
You arrest three guys for a killing
and put them in jail overnight.

296
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,388
Next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man.

297
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,892
If you're guilty, you know you're
caught and let your guard down.

298
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,311
- You follow me?
- No.

299
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,230
Let me get right to the point.

300
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,566
I'm smarter than you.

301
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:29,780
And I'll find out what I want whether you like it or not.

302
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,783
I'm not a rat.

303
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,998
Thank you.

304
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,798
When I picked beans in Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee.

305
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:51,885
Right off the trees. That was good. This is shit,

306
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,555
- but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?

307
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,850
What happened after the lineup?

308
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,191
The desk sergeant said he couldn't release you.

309
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,861
You weren't even charged.

310
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:18,036
I want pictures of your face. I'll take them to the DA.

311
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:19,371
Forget about it.

312
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,874
I'll have this thing in front of a Grand Jury by Monday.

313
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,167
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

314
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:29,089
What did Fortier and Renault say?

315
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,800
They asked for more time to think about investing.

316
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,262
- They just want more time.
- More time for what, Edie?

317
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,016
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they'll still find out about me.

318
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,059
Give me some credit.

319
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,314
Let's go to the Grand Jury. This isn't going to stop.

320
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:48,150
It's never going to stop, period.

321
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,945
By next week, every investor will walk away from us.

322
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,242
It's finished. I'm finished.

323
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,334
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

324
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,379
It's never going to stop.

325
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:17,930
I love you.

326
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,558
They ruined me in there tonight.

327
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,520
I love you.

328
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,314
Do you hear me?

329
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:35,489
What?

330
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,496
Let's just go to my place.

331
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:00,138
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

332
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,769
- All right.
- Let's go.

333
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,691
<i>Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition,</i>

334
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,944
<i>a fast jump, high risk, long money.</i>

335
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:18,448
<i>We knew it could be done, but doing it wrong meant killing.</i>

336
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,995
<i>To do it right took five men. Five men meant Keaton.</i>

337
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:26,748
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

338
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,544
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

339
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,422
Bullshit.

340
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,299
Bullshit.

341
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,468
They don't operate anymore.

342
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:42,556
McManus' friend in the 14th says they're doing one job on Thursday.

343
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:47,769
Some emerald smuggler. McManus has a fence.

344
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,647
- A fence? Who?
- A guy in California. Redfoot.

345
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:53,901
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

346
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,903
What's it to you if I do or not?

347
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,490
They don't know me, you do. They won't take me unless you go.

348
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,285
I need this.

349
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,497
You don't? Is this your place?

350
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:11,084
Looks like you got a good scam going with this lawyer.

351
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,049
I'm sorry.

352
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,843
It's okay.

353
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,639
You say it's the real thing, that's cool.

354
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,561
- You okay?
- I was out of line.

355
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,106
But they'll never stop with us.

356
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:36,151
They'll never let you go now.

357
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:40,322
We hit the cops where it hurts and we get well in the meantime.

358
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,036
You sure you're okay?

359
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:47,913
I'll be all right.

360
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,679
Look...

361
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,682
- Sometimes I get...
- Forget it.

362
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,813
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

363
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:24,950
So...

364
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:29,621
How do they want to do it?

365
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:34,042
McManus wants to go in shooting. I say no.

366
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:37,546
Fenster? Hockney?

367
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,424
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything.

368
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,468
I got a way to do it without killing anyone, but like I say,

369
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:46,096
they won't let me in without you.

370
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,908
Three million?

371
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,328
Maybe more.

372
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,375
No killing.

373
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,630
Not if we do it my way.

374
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,833
<i>New York's Finest Taxi Service
was not your normal taxi service.</i>

375
00:31:56,208 --> 00:32:00,212
<i>It was a ring of corrupt NYPD
cops that ran a high profit racket,</i>

376
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,464
<i>driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city.</i>

377
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,176
<i>For a few hundred dollars a mile,
you got your own police escort.</i>

378
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,136
<i>They even had business cards.</i>

379
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:12,558
<i>Someone started asking questions
and the taxi service shut down.</i>

380
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,103
<i>Ever since, Internal Affairs has been waiting to catch them.</i>

381
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:17,938
<i>And that's where we came in.</i>

382
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,692
- So how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.

383
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:26,029
Will this get me to Staten Island?

384
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,116
This'll get you to Cape Cod.

385
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:32,369
<i>McManus came to us with the job. Fenster got the vans,</i>

386
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:36,540
<i>Hockney the hardware and I figured how to get no one killed.</i>

387
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:40,043
<i>Keaton put on the finishing touch.</i>

388
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:44,381
<i>A little "fuck you" from the five of us to the NYPD.</i>

389
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,678
Careful! Careful!

390
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,097
Come on, asshole.

391
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,605
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it!

392
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:03,984
- Don't point that at me!
- What do you guys want?

393
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:08,530
Asshole!

394
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,286
Want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?

395
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,123
Fuck!

396
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,338
Good afternoon, porkchops. Now give me the shit.

397
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,132
- Give him the shit!
- Give it to him, man!

398
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:30,886
Hurry up!

399
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:36,141
- Now the money.
- There's no money.

400
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,102
Give me the fucking money.

401
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:40,562
There's no money.

402
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:42,564
- Give him the fucking money!
- There's no money.

403
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,233
Hurry up!

404
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,528
Do you know who I am?

405
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,738
You know who the fuck I am?

406
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:52,574
We do now, jerkoff.

407
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,375
What's that?

408
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,797
Shit!

409
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,357
<i>Keaton made an anonymous phone call.</i>

410
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:28,110
<i>The press was on the scene before the police.</i>

411
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:33,448
<i>Strausz and Rizzi were indicted and weeks later, 50 more cops.</i>

412
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,869
<i>Everybody got it in the ass from the Chief on down.</i>

413
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:39,079
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

414
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,173
I owe you two-fifty.

415
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:52,050
Doctor Keaton.

416
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,723
- There's more than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

417
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:01,351
Redfoot doesn't come to me, I always go to him.

418
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,229
In California?

419
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,649
Yes. Fenster and I...

420
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:11,153
Hold the fucking phone! You and Fenster?

421
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:16,783
- You fucking kidding me?
- Okay, everyone's going.

422
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,744
We all go.

423
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,372
What's your fucking problem?

424
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:25,375
You and Fenster are off honeymooning in California

425
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,961
and the rest of us are holding our dicks.

426
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:32,799
The job is over. Cool it.

427
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,261
LA's a good place to lie low for a while.

428
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,432
You want to dance?

429
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,316
Ladies.

430
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,034
I would like to propose a toast.

431
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,162
There you go.

432
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:05,999
To Mr. Verbal.

433
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,753
The man with the plan.

434
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:24,601
We're going to miss the flight.

435
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,397
Don't do this. Send her a note.

436
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,400
I said we'll make it.

437
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,227
We're going to miss the plane.

438
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,564
She'll understand.

439
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,002
That's heartwarming. Really.

440
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,839
I'm weepy.

441
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,592
Want to wait outside?

442
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:45,182
I'm telling you what happened after the lineup.

443
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:48,644
Come on, Verbal, who do you think you're talking to?

444
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:53,941
You expect me to believe he retired? For a woman?

445
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,904
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

446
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:01,406
- He loved her.
- Sure.

447
00:38:01,657 --> 00:38:04,910
<i>And hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea either?</i>

448
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:08,705
<i>- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for 4 years.</i>

449
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,167
<i>Who knew the Service better? That job had his name on it.</i>

450
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:13,710
<i>Edie had him all turned round.</i>

451
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,462
Let me tell you something.

452
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:20,133
I know Keaton. I've been investigating him for 3 years.

453
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,970
He's a cold-blooded bastard.

454
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:27,599
IAD indicted him on 3 counts
of murder before he was kicked off.

455
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:29,810
Don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.

456
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,603
You've got him all wrong.

457
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:33,981
Do I?

458
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:38,735
He was under indictment 7 times while he was on the force.

459
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:42,447
In every case, the witnesses either reversed their testimony...

460
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,617
or died before they could testify.

461
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:50,372
They finally nailed him for fraud
and he spent 5 years in Sing Sing.

462
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,708
He killed 3 prisoners inside.

463
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,294
Of course, I can't prove this.

464
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:59,047
But I can't prove the best part either.

465
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:04,553
Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that?

466
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,056
He died in a fire two years ago during an investigation into

467
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:11,894
the murder of a witness who was going to testify against him.

468
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:16,732
Two people saw him walk into his warehouse before it blew up.

469
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:20,402
They said he went in to check a leaking gas main.

470
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:24,531
It blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.

471
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:30,037
Within three months the two witnesses were dead.

472
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,789
One killed himself in his car,

473
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:36,126
the other fell down an open elevator shaft.

474
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,048
<i>Let's get this show on the road.</i>

475
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,634
This is not what we discussed. There are too many people.

476
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,470
We'll be out of here before he blows his porch light.

477
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:50,766
- I have a noon meeting.
- Everyone calm down, all right?

478
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,645
I want you to ask this man about the shoot-out in the harbor.

479
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,699
He says they were buying...

480
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,493
Dope. We know.

481
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:19,294
He doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope. People.

482
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:20,629
What?

483
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:31,473
- He needs guarantees...
- What's he talking about?

484
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:33,350
He says his life's in danger.

485
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:38,397
He saw the devil, looked him in the eye.

486
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,899
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.

487
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:44,027
Ask him to tell you what he told me.

488
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,906
The devil. Who's the devil?

489
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,581
Keyser Soze.

490
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:04,381
He was in the harbor killing many men.

491
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,758
He saw Keyser Soze?

492
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:15,642
He saw his face.

493
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:18,478
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

494
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:20,189
Describe him.

495
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:29,615
<i>I get an anonymous phone call</i>

496
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,868
<i>telling me I can find Keaton at Mondino's with his attorney,</i>

497
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:33,911
<i>and there he is.</i>

498
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,581
Because he never profited from his alleged death,

499
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:42,377
and we pinned the murder on another, we had to let him go.

500
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:46,632
He was dead long enough for the murder rap to blow over,

501
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:48,467
and then he had lunch.

502
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:52,471
- I don't know about that.
- I don't think you do.

503
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,641
But you say you saw Keaton die.

504
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:58,519
I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there.

505
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:01,271
He's behind the whole circus at the harbor.

506
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,775
He's using you because you're stupid
and you think he's your friend.

507
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,236
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

508
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,531
I want to be sure he's dead before I go back to New York.

509
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,242
It was the lawyer behind it.

510
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:15,494
What lawyer?

511
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:17,287
What lawyer, Verbal?

512
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:20,374
When I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

513
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:24,586
You held out on the DA! What did you leave out?

514
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,756
- I can phone Deemer in ten minutes.
- The DA gave me immunity.

515
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:32,010
You get no immunity from me, you piece of shit.

516
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:35,305
Every criminal I put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor,

517
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:39,476
every creep and scumbag will know the name Verbal Kint.

518
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,396
Talk, or that precious immunity they see fit to grant you

519
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:46,817
won't be worth the paper of the contract put out on you.

520
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,780
There was a lawyer.

521
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,741
Kobayashi.

522
00:42:55,409 --> 00:43:00,330
- Did he kill Keaton?
- No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.

523
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:02,207
Convince me.

524
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,586
And tell me every last detail.

525
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:27,983
<i>In Los Angeles we met McManus'fence, Redfoot.</i>

526
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:32,196
<i>He had a good reputation, he seemed like a good guy.</i>

527
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,781
We should have known better.

528
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:35,741
How you doing?

529
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,827
- Good. You?
- Not bad, can't complain.

530
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,788
How you doing, Fenster?

531
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,708
Want me to open it, Ray?

532
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:52,549
You must be Keaton.

533
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:54,927
Redfoot, Dean Keaton,

534
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:56,929
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

535
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:59,681
Verbal, the man with the plan.

536
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:01,892
You guys interested in more work?

537
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,394
We're always looking for work.

538
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:05,854
We're on vacation.

539
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,148
Well, that's too bad.

540
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:12,444
I got a ton of work and no good people. Not like you guys.

541
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:16,406
- What's the job?
- A Texas jeweler named Saul.

542
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:18,909
He rents a hotel suite downtown.

543
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:22,704
He does free appraisals. Sometimes buys, sometimes doesn't.

544
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:25,582
He carries around a lot of cash.

545
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,420
I figure I get the merchandise, you keep the green.

546
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,299
- What about security?
- Couple of bodyguards.

547
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:35,717
Nothing you couldn't handle.

548
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:38,220
Give me time to check it out?

549
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,931
I'd expect nothing less from you.

550
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,476
We'll call you.

551
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,479
Enjoy LA... Get yourself laid.

552
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:56,405
Friend of mine in New York says you knew Spook Hollis.

553
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:59,575
The way I hear it, you did time with old Spook.

554
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:04,163
Good man. I used to run dope for him.

555
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,875
- Too bad he got shivved.
- Yeah.

556
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:10,878
I shivved him.

557
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:16,008
Better you hear it from me now than from somebody else.

558
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,179
I appreciate that.

559
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:22,973
Just out of curiosity,

560
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:24,641
was it business,

561
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:27,060
or personal?

562
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:29,521
A bit of both.

563
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,108
Like I said,

564
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,111
give me a call if you're interested.

565
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:42,159
Is there a problem?

566
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:46,914
One job. That was the deal.

567
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,087
One job?

568
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,717
One job?

569
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:01,595
That's a good one, Keaton.

570
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:07,559
<i>Keaton fought as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.</i>

571
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,729
<i>He can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself.</i>

572
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:14,274
<i>One day of McManus nagging and we went back to work.</i>

573
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:31,416
So my car is wrecked.

574
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:35,170
I look in the other car and this woman is naked.

575
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:38,549
- I laugh so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

576
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,259
Freeze!

577
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:41,301
Here we go!

578
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:42,636
Right there.

579
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:45,556
The second one.

580
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:51,895
Give me the case. Give me the fucking case!

581
00:46:58,402 --> 00:47:01,697
Give me the fucking case! For the last time,

582
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:03,907
give me the fucking case!

583
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:09,788
Come on!

584
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:11,081
Don't move.

585
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:48,118
Just hand over the case.

586
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:50,996
Hand over the fucking case.

587
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,688
Come on, let's go.

588
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:20,734
Bad day. Fuck it.

589
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,361
Go! Go!

590
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:48,387
Fuck.

591
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:54,142
Looks like a lot of China to me. Shit!

592
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:01,149
Guys, come on!

593
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:04,903
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna kill him.

594
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:08,115
- Now we'll do it my way.
- Are you gonna kill him?

595
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:09,408
I'm gonna deal with him.

596
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:12,661
- You better, or I'm going to.
- Shut up.

597
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:21,044
What do I do with that?

598
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,131
Feed it to the gimp.

599
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,342
- Ease his pain.
- You don't know what that is?

600
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:30,012
Some lawyer threw me this job.

601
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,138
Yeah, who?

602
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:32,973
I don't know. Some Limey.

603
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,517
He's a middle man for someone.

604
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,645
- He doesn't say. I don't ask.
- You're fucking full of shit!

605
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:39,563
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

606
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,317
Listen. We want to meet him.

607
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,444
That's funny.

608
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,822
He called me last night. Says he wants to meet you guys.

609
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:51,617
Okay.

610
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,452
- We'll meet him.
- I'll call you.

611
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:56,705
- Good. Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it. Wait a minute.

612
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:58,290
One more thing, tough guy.

613
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:01,293
Any more surprises and I'll kill you.

614
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:05,631
Such a tough guy, McManus. Do me a favor, all right?

615
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:07,633
Get the fuck off my dick.

616
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:13,013
Put a leash on that puppy.

617
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,935
Shame about Saul getting whacked.

618
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:21,188
Cops are going to be looking for the guys who did it.

619
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,858
Sooner or later they'll come around asking me.

620
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:29,655
You have a sweet night, ladies.

621
00:50:33,158 --> 00:50:34,952
Fuck you.

622
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:43,585
- So, this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

623
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:46,713
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

624
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:49,758
Why leave this out when you talked to the DA?

625
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,177
Dave, someone to see you.

626
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:59,518
I've been looking all over for you.

627
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:03,272
Still after that coke that left that
bloodbath in the harbor yesterday?

628
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,983
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

629
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:11,363
I talked to the guy they pulled out
of a drain pipe after the shootout.

630
00:51:11,947 --> 00:51:13,991
He came to this morning.

631
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:16,994
He's part of a Hungarian mob doing a deal with Argentineans.

632
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:20,038
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

633
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:21,206
But...

634
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,292
Our man says no way on the dope.

635
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:27,087
The whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

636
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,757
They had no time to negotiate or move that kind of product.

637
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:32,926
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

638
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:38,015
No one knew except for key people.
They were very hush about it.

639
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:41,351
It was very sensitive.

640
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:42,561
I don't get it.

641
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:46,982
They tell me you got the cripple. Did he mention Keyser Soze?

642
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:47,774
Who?

643
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:50,235
Just bear with me here.

644
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:55,574
- Who is Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!

645
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:59,036
We've been going over this for an hour and a half.

646
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:03,665
We need to find Redfoot, and get the hell out of here.

647
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:07,252
What we need to do is think back.

648
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,131
Somebody with power,

649
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:15,010
capable of tracking us from New York to Los Angeles.

650
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:17,930
- C'mon Dean... What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

651
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:22,434
- Sit down. Sit down.
- No. It's hot and I'm fucking bored.

652
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:25,895
Mr. Hockney, do stay. Mr. Keaton.

653
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,026
Mr. Fenster, I recognize from the mugshots, as well as and Mr. McManus.

654
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:35,989
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint, the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

655
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,494
My employer sends his gratitude. A most unexpected benefit.

656
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:42,913
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

657
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:47,751
I've been asked by my employer to bring a proposal.

658
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:51,129
- What do you want?
- Your services, gentlemen.

659
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:56,718
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

660
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,305
He doesn't expect you all to live, but those of you who do

661
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:03,600
will have 91 million dollars to divide between you

662
00:53:03,767 --> 00:53:05,727
- in any way you see fit.
- Who's your boss?

663
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:10,357
I work for Keyser Soze.

664
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,164
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Judging by the change in mood,

665
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,791
I feel your associates can tell you.

666
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,461
I come with an offer from Mr. Soze.

667
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:35,299
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean "an order"?

668
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,093
In 1981, Mr. Keaton, you hijacked

669
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,971
a truck in Buffalo, New York.

670
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:44,683
The cargo was raw steel which belonged to Mr. Soze

671
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:48,979
and was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor.

672
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:52,357
A most profitable violation of UN regulations.

673
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:54,443
You had no way of knowing this

674
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,696
because the man shipping the steel was working for Mr. Soze

675
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,198
without his knowledge.

676
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:01,283
Earlier this year, Mr. Fenster

677
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:06,121
and Mr. McManus hijacked a cargo flight out of Newark.

678
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:10,667
The plane carried gold and platinum wiring, also for Pakistan.

679
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:13,670
Two months ago, Mr. Hockney

680
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:16,590
stole a truck carrying gun parts through Queens.

681
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,844
They were set to be destroyed by the State of New York.

682
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:24,598
They were to be lost and re-routed to New York.

683
00:54:24,932 --> 00:54:27,976
Again Mr. Soze using pawns who had no knowledge.

684
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,979
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

685
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:32,940
Nine months ago,

686
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:35,817
an unintelligent courier for Mr. Soze

687
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:40,531
was taken in a confidence scam by a cripple.

688
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:44,201
He was relieved of $62,000.

689
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:47,496
It's taken us some time to find you.

690
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:51,667
We were to approach you after your apprehension in New York.

691
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,086
- You set up the lineup.
- Yes,

692
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,588
I was to come and see you.

693
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,675
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Miss Finnerman,

694
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,470
was a little too effective in expediting his release.

695
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:05,848
Holding the rest of you became a moot point.

696
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,809
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

697
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:11,562
Mr. Soze rarely works with the same people for very long,

698
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:13,480
and they never know who they're working for.

699
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:17,985
One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.

700
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,487
So why are you telling us?

701
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:25,784
Because you've stolen from Mr. Soze, all of you.

702
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,205
That you did not know it is the reason you're still alive.

703
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:34,418
He feels you owe him. You will repay your debt.

704
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:38,547
Fuck the debt and you. How do we know you work for Soze?

705
00:55:39,047 --> 00:55:41,633
I don't think that's relevant.

706
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:46,471
You're responsible for the murder
of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

707
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:50,851
Redfoot can testify and we can see to it that he will.

708
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:54,354
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

709
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:58,233
Mr. Soze's primary interest is narcotics.

710
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:03,864
He has been competing for years with some Argentineans.

711
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:07,284
Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.

712
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:11,330
These Argentineans are negotiating the sale of 91...

713
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:14,374
million dollars in cocaine in 3 days.

714
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:18,921
This purchase will revitalize the diminishing strength

715
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:20,547
of their organization.

716
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:24,843
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.

717
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:30,599
You may wait until after the buy. Any money is yours.

718
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:36,813
He would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine.

719
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:41,944
Then you will be free of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

720
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:47,199
Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.

721
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:50,285
A gift

722
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:51,745
from Mr. Soze.

723
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:56,542
Good day, gentlemen.

724
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:09,364
They've got my whole life, everything I've done since I was 18.

725
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,325
They fuckin' know everything.

726
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,745
Everybody I've worked with or did time with.

727
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:34,515
- No. This isn't right.
- I don't know.

728
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:37,100
Who was that guy who talked about Soze in New York?

729
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,646
Bricks Marlin.

730
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,774
Yeah, he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff.

731
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:47,194
Said he always made five times more than the job was worth.

732
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:52,741
A pipe dream. Kobayashi's using him as window dressing.

733
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,952
I don't know. This is bad.

734
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:59,081
It's bullshit. Guy could be LAPD. It's a fucking setup.

735
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:03,001
The way I hear it, Soze's some kind of butcher.

736
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:07,631
- A peerless psycho butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

737
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:12,094
Who is Keyser Soze?

738
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:16,557
He's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German.

739
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:18,851
Nobody believed he was real

740
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:22,271
or saw anybody that worked directly for him.

741
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:25,357
To hear Kobayashi, anyone could have worked for Soze.

742
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:28,610
You never knew. That was his power.

743
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,531
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

744
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:36,076
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

745
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:41,498
A story they told me that I believe is from his days in Turkey.

746
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:44,168
Some Hungarians wanted their own mob.

747
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,503
They realized that to be in power,

748
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:49,631
you didn't need guns or money or even numbers.

749
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:53,177
You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.

750
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:57,014
They come into power and then they come after Soze.

751
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:59,892
He was just running dope then.

752
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,313
They come to his home in the afternoon

753
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,107
<i>looking for his business.</i>

754
01:00:07,274 --> 01:00:10,986
<i>They find his wife and kids and decide to wait for Soze.</i>

755
01:00:27,336 --> 01:00:31,548
<i>He comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming.</i>

756
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,093
<i>The Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with.</i>

757
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:36,970
So they let him know they meant business.

758
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,812
<i>They tell him they want his territory, all his business.</i>

759
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:50,108
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

760
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:55,322
Then he showed these men of will what will really was.

761
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,469
<i>He tells them he would rather see his family dead</i>

762
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,055
<i>than live another day after this.</i>

763
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,725
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go.</i>

764
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:28,230
After his wife and kids are buried,
he goes after the rest of the mob.

765
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:31,859
He kills their kids, he kills their wives,

766
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:33,610
parents and their parents' friends.

767
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,405
<i>He burns down their houses</i>

768
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,032
<i>and the stores they work in.</i>

769
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:42,870
<i>He kills people that owe them money. And like that...</i>

770
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:47,666
he's gone. Nobody's seen him since.

771
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:52,087
He becomes a myth, a spook story
criminals tell their kids at night.

772
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:55,591
"Rat on your Pop, and Keyser Soze will get you. "

773
01:01:56,258 --> 01:02:00,179
- And no on ever really believes.
- Do you believe in him, Verbal?

774
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:06,476
Keaton always said: "I don't believe in God,

775
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,604
but I'm afraid of him".

776
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:12,232
Well I believe in God...

777
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:16,987
and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.

778
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:25,704
Do you give any weight to this?

779
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:29,833
Dan Metzheiser from Justice has a file on Soze in D.C.

780
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:35,172
It's his hobby. Guys equate him to
that reporter on Incredible Hulk.

781
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:45,015
- You've heard of him?
- On the street, a few times.

782
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:46,517
Outside stuff.

783
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:51,605
Somebody working for a guy who got money from Keyser Soze.

784
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:55,776
It could be an old badge, a hex sign.

785
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:58,195
When a name meant something.

786
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:01,114
- But you're here.
- Well, shit yeah.

787
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:04,910
A burnt guy tries to walk out of
hospital because he's afraid of Soze.

788
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:07,871
I'll run it up the flagpole.

789
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:11,959
I told you like it happened.

790
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:16,880
So I left out how I got there? D.A. Would have cut my amnesty.

791
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:19,007
You got what you wanted out of me. So big fucking deal.

792
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:22,094
- That's why you never told the D. A?
- You tell me, Agent Kujan.

793
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:25,347
If I said the Loch Ness Monster hired me, what would you say?

794
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:28,141
Turn state's evidence.

795
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:30,644
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?

796
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,438
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

797
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:36,275
Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

798
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:38,527
Where do you think the pressure's coming from?

799
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:41,613
Keyser Soze knows where I am right now.

800
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:45,534
He's got you to let me go so he
can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

801
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:49,830
Immunity was to deal with you. I got problems when I post bail.

802
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,040
Why play into his hands? We can protect you.

803
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:54,293
Thanks, Dave.

804
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:57,129
Bang-up job so far: Extortion, coercion.

805
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,173
Pardon me, but kiss my pucker.

806
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:03,844
The same fuckers that rounded us up are now bailing me out?

807
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:08,682
Think you can catch Keyser Soze?

808
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:13,228
You think a guy like that gets close to sticking his head out?

809
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:17,608
If he comes up, it'll be to get me. And after that...

810
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:21,612
you'll never hear from him again.

811
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:45,469
What happened next?

812
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:47,888
We woke up and Fenster was gone.

813
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,724
He didn't like slumming for Soze.

814
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:55,229
He left a good luck note and took a chunk of the money.

815
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:58,607
- Then what?
- McManus was furious.

816
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:02,694
He talked about tracking him down and ripping his heart out.

817
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,739
That night we got the call.

818
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:07,324
What call?

819
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:10,410
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

820
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,546
Let's get the fuck out of here.

821
01:05:22,214 --> 01:05:24,007
We got to bury him.

822
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:27,511
- With what?
- With our hands.

823
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:38,564
This is nuts.

824
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:44,111
It's dry sand. When he rots,
surfers will smell him a mile away.

825
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:45,654
Dig, you fuck.

826
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:48,365
What are we gonna do? This guy is gonna kill us.

827
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:52,119
I don't know about you, pegleg, but I got no problem running.

828
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:56,248
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.

829
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:01,545
If you run, we'll be digging a hole for you. You got that?

830
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:05,966
This ain't my boy we're burying. I don't owe anybody.

831
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:10,220
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for 5 years.

832
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:15,434
We did more jobs and saw more money than you can count.

833
01:06:16,268 --> 01:06:17,519
'Cause now it's payback!

834
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:19,021
It's not payback.

835
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:25,527
It's precaution. You want payback or run away? I don't care.

836
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:31,825
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

837
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:34,578
I'm not doing it for you.

838
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:37,873
I'm doing this for me.

839
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,960
I'm gonna to finish this thing.

840
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:46,215
This Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me.

841
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:09,154
After they killed Fenster, nobody would run?

842
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:13,075
- I wanted to.
- Why didn't you say anything?

843
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:17,204
I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have
it. It was too far-fetched for him.

844
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:20,082
Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex cop.

845
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:24,545
To a cop, the explanation is always simple.

846
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:27,756
There's no mystery to the street, no arch-criminal behind it.

847
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:31,260
You got a dead body and you think
his brother did it, you're right.

848
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:35,389
Nobody argued with Keaton. They set about whacking Kobayashi.

849
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:47,151
They're coming up.

850
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:50,946
<i>You hear me? He's coming up.</i>

851
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,739
He's on his way down.

852
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:51,048
Don't move.

853
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:53,759
Press 20. Do it now.

854
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:15,072
Move!

855
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:19,493
The answer is no.

856
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:21,453
Mr. Soze will be most...

857
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:25,332
There is no Soze. Mention his name again and I'll kill you.

858
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:29,837
A strange threat. I assume you've come here to kill me anyway.

859
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:38,220
We know that you can get to us.

860
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:40,764
But now you know we can get to you.

861
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:44,935
I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.

862
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:50,023
My employer's made up his mind. He does not change it.

863
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:51,358
Neither do we.

864
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,987
You got Fenster, but you won't be able to get all of us.

865
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:56,905
Not before one of us gets you.

866
01:09:57,156 --> 01:10:00,409
I believe you, I sincerely do.

867
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,996
You would not have been chosen were you not so suitable.

868
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:05,873
But I cannot make this decision.

869
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:10,335
Whatever you threaten me with is ludicrous in comparison to

870
01:10:10,627 --> 01:10:13,797
what will be done to me if I do
not carry out my orders in full.

871
01:10:21,263 --> 01:10:23,265
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

872
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:27,769
I just wanted you to know that.

873
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,898
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

874
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:35,777
I implore you, believe me. Mr. Soze is very real.

875
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:38,864
- And very determined.
- We'll see.

876
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:49,583
Before you do me in, Mr. McManus,

877
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:53,629
will you let me finish my business with Miss Finneran?

878
01:10:58,926 --> 01:11:00,469
What did you say?

879
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:05,432
Edie Finneran. She's upstairs, in my office

880
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:08,977
for an extradition deposition.

881
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,897
I requested her personally.

882
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:13,315
She flew in yesterday.

883
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:19,571
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.

884
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:25,828
You're lying.

885
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:27,454
Am I?

886
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:47,474
Her escort while she's here

887
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:50,561
in Los Angeles. Never leaves her side.

888
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,897
She's in good hands.

889
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:00,904
Get some rest. The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

890
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:03,699
If I see you or any of your friends before then,

891
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:08,287
she will be the victim of a gruesome violation before dying.

892
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:11,206
As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney,

893
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:14,835
and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

894
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:19,506
I might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

895
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:23,760
Do I make myself clear?

896
01:12:24,303 --> 01:12:28,974
Take care of the bodies. Add it the cost of Mr. Fenster.

897
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,518
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

898
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:12,059
It's a logistical nightmare.

899
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:15,729
Close quarters, ten maybe twenty men.

900
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:18,649
No telling how many below deck.

901
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:21,318
- Can we stealth these guys?
- No.

902
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:24,238
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

903
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:28,283
Now sunny point number two.

904
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:31,829
If one of us gets through and jacks
the boat, we still got nothing.

905
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:34,081
What if we wait for the money?

906
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:36,416
Ten more men at least.

907
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,045
In my opinion, it can't be done.

908
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,422
No one comes out alive.

909
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:44,049
I'm gonna wait for the money.

910
01:13:44,925 --> 01:13:47,261
- Me too.
- Didn't you hear what he said?

911
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:50,013
- Lf I'm going in, I want a cut.
- Me too.

912
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:54,059
There's nothing that can't be done.

913
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:59,773
We're walking into certain death.

914
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:09,741
The news said it's raining in New York.

915
01:14:31,346 --> 01:14:34,099
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

916
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,560
Russian, I think.

917
01:14:37,978 --> 01:14:39,521
Hungarian?

918
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,713
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

919
01:16:05,983 --> 01:16:07,234
You kids ready?

920
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:09,820
I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.

921
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,073
I'm ready. McManus...

922
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,867
<i>you better be set up in 10 seconds.</i>

923
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:18,537
I'm ready.

924
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,790
I want you to stay here.

925
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,418
I'm supposed to cover...

926
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:27,379
If I don't get out of this, I
want you to take the money and go.

927
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:32,634
Tell Edie what happened. She knows people and what to do.

928
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:36,096
If I don't get Kobayashi, she'll get him her way.

929
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,557
- What if I?
- Just do what I say.

930
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:40,809
Please.

931
01:16:43,854 --> 01:16:44,980
Tell her that...

932
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:50,694
Tell her I tried.

933
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:06,210
<i>McManus, he's on his way.</i>

934
01:17:06,585 --> 01:17:07,920
I'm there.

935
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:03,725
One, two, three, four...

936
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:07,187
five, six, seven.

937
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:10,482
Oswald was a fag.

938
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:21,785
Hi. How you doing?

939
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:26,623
Is there a problem?

940
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:53,692
Now.

941
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,767
Old MacDonald had a farm.

942
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:34,733
And on this farm he shot some guys.

943
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:09,893
Elvis has left the building.

944
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,413
Why didn't you run?

945
01:22:35,038 --> 01:22:36,415
I froze up.

946
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:40,127
I thought about how Fenster looked when we buried him.

947
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:43,922
And then about Keaton. Looked like he might pull it off.

948
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:55,517
A boy found a body on the beach shot twice in the head.

949
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:58,479
- The Bureau identified him.
- What else?

950
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:01,690
Arturo Marquez, a petty smuggler from Argentina.

951
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:06,361
Arrested, New York, for trafficking. He escapes to California.

952
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:11,658
Picked up on Long Beach, they set
up extradition, he escapes again.

953
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:17,080
Get this. Edie Finneran's brought
in to advise on the proceedings.

954
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:18,373
Kobayashi.

955
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:21,752
New York faxed a copy of his testimony. He was a rat.

956
01:23:22,044 --> 01:23:26,006
- Yeah, a big fucking rat.
- He opposed returning to prison.

957
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:30,093
So he named close to fifty people.

958
01:23:30,636 --> 01:23:32,387
Guess who he named in the finale.

959
01:23:33,889 --> 01:23:35,307
Keyser Soze.

960
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:36,934
There's more.

961
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:52,866
I'll tell you what I know. Stop me when this sounds familiar.

962
01:23:54,827 --> 01:23:57,329
There was no dope on that boat.

963
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:40,414
You, stay quiet.

964
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:43,584
He's here. I know he's here.

965
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:46,336
That's him. I'm telling you.

966
01:24:46,628 --> 01:24:48,338
I know he's here.

967
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:53,260
- You can't understand. That's him!
- Shut up!

968
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:57,598
I tell you it's Keyser Soze!

969
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:57,217
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

970
01:26:57,551 --> 01:26:59,928
- There's no coke.
- What?

971
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:04,308
There's no coke. I've been up and down this ship,

972
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:08,479
in every fucking room. There is nothing!

973
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:09,980
Nothing!

974
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:12,065
Don't fuck with me.

975
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:15,986
There is no fucking coke!

976
01:27:26,872 --> 01:27:28,332
I'm out of here.

977
01:28:09,498 --> 01:28:11,542
I told them nothing.

978
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:13,877
I swear.

979
01:28:14,419 --> 01:28:17,130
I told them nothing. Please.

980
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:04,219
McManus.

981
01:29:04,636 --> 01:29:06,054
What the fuck is going on?

982
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:10,184
The strangest thing.

983
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:08,534
It's in your statement: You saw
a man in a suit with a slim build.

984
01:30:08,826 --> 01:30:10,160
- Wait a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

985
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:14,206
You saw Soze and told the DA you didn't know who it was?

986
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:18,460
- There was dope on that boat.
- You know what I'm getting at.

987
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:20,295
- Get out of my face.
- You know.

988
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:21,964
I've got immunity. I don't have to take that shit.

989
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:25,509
- You know what I'm getting at.
- I don't know.

990
01:30:25,801 --> 01:30:26,885
The truth.

991
01:30:27,386 --> 01:30:29,680
Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.

992
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:32,099
- I did.
- You are lying to me.

993
01:30:32,558 --> 01:30:34,768
You've known this whole time.

994
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:37,980
I don't know what you're saying. I did see Keaton get shot.

995
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:41,233
Then why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

996
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,484
He was your friend.

997
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:48,699
Because I was of afraid.

998
01:30:49,575 --> 01:30:50,534
Okay?

999
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:52,953
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1000
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:56,498
I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1001
01:30:57,249 --> 01:31:01,086
It was Keyser Soze, the Devil himself.

1002
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:05,007
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1003
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:11,221
What if you miss?

1004
01:31:15,851 --> 01:31:18,604
Let's get back to the pier.

1005
01:32:41,562 --> 01:32:44,940
- Ever hear of Arturo Marquez?
- What? No.

1006
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:49,069
<i>He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Dept. He swore</i>

1007
01:32:49,403 --> 01:32:53,866
to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could identify

1008
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:55,617
<i>one Keyser Soze.</i>

1009
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:56,952
It says right here in the report.

1010
01:32:57,244 --> 01:33:01,665
He had knowledge of his business, including drug trafficking

1011
01:33:01,832 --> 01:33:04,793
- and murder.
- I never heard of him.

1012
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:06,670
His people were selling him

1013
01:33:06,837 --> 01:33:07,880
<i>to a gang of Hungarians.</i>

1014
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:11,717
<i>Most likely the ones that Soze all but wiped out in Turkey.</i>

1015
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:16,305
The money wasn't for dope. They were buying the one guy

1016
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,390
<i>that could incriminate Soze.</i>

1017
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,976
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1018
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:23,979
<i>Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition advisor.</i>

1019
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:26,023
<i>She knew who he was and what he knew.</i>

1020
01:33:26,857 --> 01:33:29,860
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit...

1021
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:32,821
a suicide mission to whack out

1022
01:33:32,988 --> 01:33:35,115
<i>the guy that could finger Soze.</i>

1023
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:39,953
<i>Soze sent men in that he could march into certain death.</i>

1024
01:33:40,245 --> 01:33:42,998
Soze sent us to kill someone?

1025
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:46,668
<i>I'm saying Keaton did. He left you behind for a reason.</i>

1026
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,545
Just do what I tell you.

1027
01:33:48,879 --> 01:33:51,715
If you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere,

1028
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:55,511
why give you the money to run?
He could've used you on the boat.

1029
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:57,429
He wanted me to live.

1030
01:33:59,056 --> 01:34:02,684
<i>A dirty cop without loyalties</i>

1031
01:34:02,976 --> 01:34:05,103
<i>finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple?</i>

1032
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:06,605
No sir! Why?

1033
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:08,232
Edie!

1034
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,151
<i>I don't buy that reformed story.</i>

1035
01:34:11,443 --> 01:34:15,656
Even if I did, I don't believe he'd send you to protect her.

1036
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:17,866
So why?

1037
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:23,205
- Because he was my friend.
- No, Verbal.

1038
01:34:23,539 --> 01:34:26,416
He wasn't your friend. Keaton didn't have friends.

1039
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:27,626
What are you doing here?

1040
01:34:27,793 --> 01:34:28,794
<i>He saved you</i>

1041
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:31,588
because he wanted it that way. It was his will.

1042
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:34,091
Keaton was Keyser Soze!

1043
01:34:34,967 --> 01:34:35,926
<i>The kind of man</i>

1044
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:36,927
who could wrangle

1045
01:34:37,094 --> 01:34:38,387
<i>the wills of men like Hockney and McManus,</i>

1046
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:41,140
and engineer a police lineup

1047
01:34:41,682 --> 01:34:43,642
through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1048
01:34:43,809 --> 01:34:46,436
The kind of man who could've killed Edie Finnerman.

1049
01:34:51,483 --> 01:34:54,361
She was found yesterday in a hotel.

1050
01:34:54,528 --> 01:34:56,071
Shot twice in the head.

1051
01:35:00,909 --> 01:35:03,620
What do you think about Keaton now?

1052
01:35:05,218 --> 01:35:06,262
Edie?

1053
01:35:06,429 --> 01:35:10,141
He used all of you to get him on the boat.

1054
01:35:08,514 --> 01:35:12,226
<i>He couldn't get on alone. He had to pull the trigger</i>

1055
01:35:12,477 --> 01:35:16,397
to make sure he got the one man who could identify him.

1056
01:35:17,357 --> 01:35:20,651
- This is all bullshit.
- You said you saw him die.

1057
01:35:23,863 --> 01:35:24,822
<i>Or did you?</i>

1058
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:27,200
You had to hide when you first heard the police cars.

1059
01:35:27,492 --> 01:35:29,869
<i>You said you heard the shot before the fire,</i>

1060
01:35:30,244 --> 01:35:31,746
but you didn't see him die.

1061
01:35:32,455 --> 01:35:35,208
- He would never...
- He programmed you

1062
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:39,963
<i>to tell us what he wanted. He knew we were close.</i>

1063
01:35:40,339 --> 01:35:42,883
<i>Why the political pressure?</i>

1064
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:44,551
Why were you protected? It was Keaton.

1065
01:35:44,718 --> 01:35:47,888
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1066
01:35:48,722 --> 01:35:51,433
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1067
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,519
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple.

1068
01:35:53,686 --> 01:35:55,229
Because you're a cripple.

1069
01:35:55,396 --> 01:35:56,772
Because you're stupid.

1070
01:35:57,398 --> 01:35:59,775
Because you're weaker than them.

1071
01:36:03,821 --> 01:36:05,114
If he's dead,

1072
01:36:05,447 --> 01:36:07,450
if what you say is true,

1073
01:36:07,742 --> 01:36:09,494
then it won't matter.

1074
01:36:10,912 --> 01:36:13,748
It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service, wasn't it?

1075
01:36:14,082 --> 01:36:17,252
- Tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1076
01:36:18,503 --> 01:36:21,506
We followed him from the beginning.

1077
01:36:22,882 --> 01:36:23,967
I didn't know.

1078
01:36:24,467 --> 01:36:26,010
I saw him die.

1079
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:30,306
I believe he's dead. Christ!

1080
01:36:31,474 --> 01:36:33,101
You're not safe on your own.

1081
01:36:37,023 --> 01:36:38,441
You think he's?

1082
01:36:38,733 --> 01:36:39,900
Keyser Soze?

1083
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:42,611
I don't know, Verbal.

1084
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:47,783
Keyser Soze's a shield. Or like you said, a spook story.

1085
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:53,039
But I know Keaton, and someone is pulling strings for you.

1086
01:36:53,622 --> 01:36:54,749
Stay here and let us protect you.

1087
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:58,794
- I'm not bait. I post today.
- You posted 20 minutes ago.

1088
01:36:59,253 --> 01:37:02,465
Captain Leo wants you out, unless you turn state's.

1089
01:37:02,798 --> 01:37:04,633
I'll take my chances.

1090
01:37:05,092 --> 01:37:08,180
If someone wants to, they'll get you out there.

1091
01:37:08,555 --> 01:37:11,933
Testify. You might not see trial.

1092
01:37:12,225 --> 01:37:13,435
Maybe so.

1093
01:37:14,978 --> 01:37:17,564
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1094
01:37:33,663 --> 01:37:34,998
Fucking cops.

1095
01:37:59,649 --> 01:38:02,360
Excuse me. Can I use your fax?

1096
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:09,159
Sign for these, Mr. Kint.

1097
01:38:10,953 --> 01:38:14,957
One watch, gold. One cigarette lighter, gold.

1098
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:18,293
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1099
01:38:18,585 --> 01:38:20,838
We still got nothing, Dave.

1100
01:38:21,171 --> 01:38:23,424
I know what I wanted about Keaton.

1101
01:38:23,716 --> 01:38:25,217
Which is nothing.

1102
01:38:25,509 --> 01:38:29,179
No matter. He must know how close we came.

1103
01:38:29,513 --> 01:38:33,475
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze, if Keaton is alive,

1104
01:38:33,851 --> 01:38:35,394
he's not coming up again.

1105
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:37,187
I'll find him.

1106
01:38:38,063 --> 01:38:39,983
Waste of time.

1107
01:38:42,485 --> 01:38:44,779
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.

1108
01:38:45,447 --> 01:38:46,281
What?

1109
01:38:47,574 --> 01:38:48,450
Nothing.

1110
01:38:50,410 --> 01:38:51,619
Man, you're a slob.

1111
01:38:52,454 --> 01:38:54,539
Yes, but it all has a system, Dave.

1112
01:38:55,707 --> 01:38:59,377
To make sense of it, you got to stand back.

1113
01:39:01,337 --> 01:39:04,549
Want to see a real horror show? See my garage.

1114
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,256
<i>Convince me.</i>

1115
01:39:44,049 --> 01:39:46,468
<i>When I was in a barbershop quartet in Skokie Illinois...</i>

1116
01:39:46,718 --> 01:39:48,220
<i>Where's your head, Agent Kujan?</i>

1117
01:39:48,428 --> 01:39:50,722
<i>What we need to do is think back.</i>

1118
01:39:50,889 --> 01:39:52,891
<i>I'm sure you've heard tall tales.</i>

1119
01:39:53,058 --> 01:39:53,934
<i>This isn't right.</i>

1120
01:39:55,435 --> 01:39:56,561
<i>It's all there.</i>

1121
01:39:56,728 --> 01:39:58,146
<i>I'm telling it straight, I swear.</i>

1122
01:39:58,313 --> 01:40:00,273
<i>Some guy in California. Redfoot.</i>

1123
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,608
<i>A gift from Mr. Soze.</i>

1124
01:40:01,775 --> 01:40:03,485
<i>Talk to me, Verbal. What about Redfoot?</i>

1125
01:40:03,652 --> 01:40:05,487
<i>Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i>

1126
01:40:05,654 --> 01:40:08,990
<i>Baritone was a big fat guy.</i>

1127
01:40:10,576 --> 01:40:11,369
<i>...never seen again.</i>

1128
01:40:12,537 --> 01:40:15,832
<i>...picking beans in Guatemala.</i>

1129
01:40:16,165 --> 01:40:18,835
<i>- You thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.</i>

1130
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:24,215
<i>The strangest thing.</i>

1131
01:40:24,382 --> 01:40:25,925
<i>How do you shoot the Devil in the back?</i>

1132
01:40:26,092 --> 01:40:29,721
<i>...protected from on high by the Prince of...</i>

1133
01:40:29,887 --> 01:40:31,597
<i>What's your story, pretzel man?</i>

1134
01:40:31,764 --> 01:40:33,766
<i>- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer, Verbal?</i>

1135
01:40:33,975 --> 01:40:35,476
<i>I am Mr. Kobayashi.</i>

1136
01:40:36,978 --> 01:40:38,730
<i>Convince me.</i>

1137
01:40:57,332 --> 01:41:00,669
<i>Every creep will know the name</i>

1138
01:41:00,836 --> 01:41:02,087
<i>of Verbal Kint.</i>

1139
01:41:02,546 --> 01:41:05,883
The cripple, did you see him? Which way did he go?

1140
01:41:06,175 --> 01:41:07,176
He went out that way.

1141
01:41:07,634 --> 01:41:09,136
<i>I know you know something.</i>

1142
01:41:10,179 --> 01:41:12,015
<i>I'm smarter than you. And I'll find out</i>

1143
01:41:12,182 --> 01:41:14,309
<i>what I want, whether you like it or not.</i>

1144
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,771
<i>You know what I'm getting at! The truth!</i>

1145
01:41:20,565 --> 01:41:23,151
<i>Somebody with power, capable of...</i>

1146
01:41:23,318 --> 01:41:25,153
<i>I'm talking about Keyser Soze!</i>

1147
01:41:26,279 --> 01:41:30,575
<i>You think a guy like that gets close to sticking his head out?</i>

1148
01:41:32,077 --> 01:41:35,205
<i>Because you're stupid. Because you're a cripple.</i>

1149
01:41:36,748 --> 01:41:39,250
<i>You've known the whole time!</i>

1150
01:41:43,672 --> 01:41:46,759
<i>I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

1151
01:41:46,926 --> 01:41:50,429
<i>First thing I learned on the job was how to spot a murderer.</i>

1152
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:52,390
<i>You got the cripple from New York.</i>

1153
01:41:53,057 --> 01:41:55,226
<i>- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?</i>

1154
01:41:56,018 --> 01:42:00,064
<i>You'll never hear from him again.</i>

1155
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:23,554
<i>The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...</i>

1156
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:26,307
<i>was convincing the world he didn't exist.</i>

1157
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:29,685
<i>And like that...</i>

1158
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:32,396
<i>he's gone.</i>
