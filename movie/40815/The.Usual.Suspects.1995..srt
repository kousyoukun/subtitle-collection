1
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,580
【非 常 嫌 疑 犯】

2
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:22,322
圣佩德罗  加利福尼亚  昨晚

3
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,000
情况怎么样，基顿？
How you doing, Keaton?

4
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,300
我的双腿失去了知觉…
I can't feel my legs...

5
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,300
凯撒
Keyser

6
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,700
准备好了吗？
Ready?

7
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
现在是什么时候了？
What time is it?

8
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,300
十二点半
12:30

9
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,800
一切得从六星期前的纽约说起
It all started back in New York six weeks ago.

10
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,500
一辆满载枪械部件的卡车，在皇后区外被劫持了
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens.

11
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
那司机没有看到劫持者的相貌
The driver didn't see anyone, but someone fucked up.

12
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,700
只听到对方说的一句话，有时候这些线索就够了
He heard a voice. Sometimes that's all you need.

13
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,368
纽约市   六星期前

14
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,800
- 麦克麦纳斯先生？ - 天！就他妈不能让我睡个安稳觉？
- Mr.McManus? - Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

15
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,100
- 我们被授权将你拘留 - 去死吧，猪
- We have a warrant for your arrest. - Fuck you, pig.

16
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,400
托德·霍克尼
Todd Hockney?

17
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,000
- 是谁找我？ - 我们是纽约市警局的
- Who wants to know? - New York Police Department.

18
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,400
- 该死的 - 不许动！
- Shit. - Freeze!

19
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
别动！
Hold it!

20
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
你们还真是如临大敌
Sure you brought enough guys?

21
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,500
这很简单:
It's quite simple:

22
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,400
餐厅的食物更换口味， 而毫不丧失其整体的艺术感
A restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic.

23
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,700
换而言之…
In other words...

24
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,900
…气氛并不是由装饰来营造的
...the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls.

25
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,100
- 让我举例来说-- - 这得我自己来判断
- Let me give you an example-- - This I had to see for myself.

26
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
大卫
David

27
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,000
- 我在谈公事 - 还有别的公事等你去谈
- I'm in a meeting. - Time for another one.

28
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,600
我来介绍一下，这位是大卫·奎恩
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

29
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,700
美国海关特别探员奎恩
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

30
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,600
这几位是纽约市警局的
These gentlemen are from the New York Police Department.

31
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,600
你气色不错，比我想象的还要好
You look good. Better than I would have thought.

32
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,600
不过是关于运枪车被劫的小麻烦
A small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns.

33
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
基顿先生？
Mr.Keaton?

34
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,200
请原谅，我要失陪一下
Will you excuse us for a moment?

35
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,200
我们得带你回局里去问话，事情不是三两句就说的清的
We have some questions to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

36
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,300
不，不，请坐下
No. Please, sit down.

37
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
不过是些小事
This is a small problem.

38
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,000
请慢用，我们迟些再谈
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

39
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,400
我根本没理由会出现在那里
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

40
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,200
这些家伙本是恶贯满盈的江洋大盗
These guys were hard-core hijackers...

41
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
…而我却也被列在其中
...but there I was.

42
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
不过我当时并不害怕
At that point, I wasn't scared.

43
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,800
我清楚自己是清白的，他们也不能拿我怎么样
I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for.

44
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,500
此外，这过程很有趣
Besides, it was fun.

45
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,400
我得把自己也当成是声名狼藉的罪犯
I got to make like I was notorious.

46
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,900
你们都知道程序
You all know the drill.

47
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,700
被叫到号的人就上前一步，念出纸上的话
When your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given.

48
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
一号，上前
Number 1, step forward.

49
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,700
“把钥匙给我，混蛋”
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

50
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
二号，上前
Number 2, step forward.

51
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,000
“把他妈钥匙给我，你这该死的混蛋！”
Gimme the fuckin' keys, you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

52
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,700
停，退后，三号上前
Knock it off. Get back. Number 3, step forward.

53
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,200
- “把钥匙给我，混蛋” - 请讲英语
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker." - In English, please.

54
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,300
- 你说什么？ - 请讲英语
- Excuse me? - In English.

55
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,100
“把钥匙给我，混蛋” ，这哪儿不对了？
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker. What the fuck?

56
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,100
四号上前
Number 4, step forward.

57
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,100
这根本是胡来，全都是栽赃嫁祸
It was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup.

58
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,400
“把钥匙给我，混蛋”
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

59
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,200
全是警察的错
It was the cops' fault.

60
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,400
像这样的人根本不该关在一起
You don't put guys like that into a room together.

61
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,600
谁知道会发生些什么？
Who knows what can happen?

62
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,100
“把钥匙给我，混蛋”
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

63
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,300
这事情一定让你们很头痛
This has really got to be embarrassing for you guys.

64
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
他们审了我们整晚上
They drilled us all night.

65
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,000
运枪车被劫，有人暴跳如雷，而警察们却束手无策
Someone was mad about that truck hijacking and the cops had nothing.

66
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,300
所以希望有人会撞到他们枪口上来
They were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something.

67
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,300
他们清楚我们不能反抗，他们知道该怎么向我们施加压力
They knew we wouldn't fight, they knew how to lean on us.

68
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,500
他们一直就是如此，我们的权利早被践踏的没影了
They've been doing it forever. Our rights went out the window.

69
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,500
那简直就是可耻的亵渎人权
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

70
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,400
他们最先审问的是麦克麦纳斯，他是个打家劫舍的老手
They went after McManus first. Topnotch entry man.

71
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,900
什么卡车？
What truck?

72
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,400
- 运枪的卡车，杂种  - “杂种”？
- The truck with the guns, fucko. - "Fucko"?

73
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,900
他是个好人，只是有时会有点疯狂
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.

74
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
想知道你的好兄弟范斯特是怎么说的？
Wanna know what your pal Fenster told us?

75
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,800
- 说谁？ - 麦克麦纳斯
- Say who? - McManus.

76
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,600
他说的完全是另外一个情况
He told us another story.

77
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,400
是说那个得了痢疾的妓女吗？
Is that the one about the hooker with the dysentery?

78
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,700
范斯特总是和麦克麦纳斯一起干，是个油腔滑调的家伙
Fenster always worked with McManus. He was a real tight-ass.

79
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,000
但是说到正事上来，他确实算是个聪明人
But when it came to the job, he was right on. A smart man.

80
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,800
- 你说什么？ - 我说他会教训你的
- What are you saying? - I said he'll flip you.

81
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
- 他会什么？ - 教训你，狠狠的教训你
- He'll what? - Flip you. Flip you for real.

82
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,300
- 我怕极了，继续 - 好吧
- I'm shaking. Come on. - Okay.

83
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
- 回答我的问题 - 后面那位也听的清吗？
- Answer my questions. - Can you hear me in the back?

84
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
喂？
Hello?

85
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,700
我要见律师
I want my lawyer.

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
我要让你们这些该死的警察丢掉饭碗
I'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

87
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,500
托德·霍克尼:爆破专家
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.

88
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
毫无疑问，这家伙不会出卖任何人
Without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

89
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,200
你们根本没有他妈的证据
You guys don't have a fuckin' leg to stand on.

90
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,500
你以为是吗？
You think so, tough guy?

91
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,100
我能以在皇后区抢劫货车的罪名起诉你
I can put you in Queens during the hijacking.

92
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
是吗？
Really?

93
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,200
我就住在皇后区
I live in Queens.

94
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,600
所以你就这么把事情凑在一起告我，爱因思坦？
Did you put that together yourself, Einstein?

95
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,300
你的那群猴子手下就是这么办事的？
You got a team of monkeys working full time on this?

96
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,700
知道你若是再投胎，会怎样？
You know what happens if you do another turn in the joint?

97
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
我会狂干你老爸
I fuck your father in the shower, and have a snack.

98
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,200
- 你想告我吗？白痴 - 我会随时控告你
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead? - I'll charge you when I'm ready.

99
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,000
- 凭什么来告我？ - 你自己心里很清楚
- With what? - You know damn well, dead man.

100
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
基顿？
But Keaton?

101
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,900
基顿是他们重点审问的目标
Keaton was the real prize for them for obvious reasons.

102
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,700
犯错的是你们，而不是我
It was your mistake, not mine.

103
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,400
你们到底问完了没有？
Did you ever stop to ask me?

104
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
我坐不改名，行不改姓
I've been walking around with the same face, the same name.

105
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,900
是个正经商人
I'm a businessman.

106
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,100
做什么生意？餐厅生意？
What's that? The restaurant business?

107
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,100
现在你要做的就是给我老实招供
No. From now on you're in the "getting fucked by us" business.

108
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
我会把你绳之以法的，混蛋
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

109
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
我已经说了…
Like I said...

110
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,700
…犯错的是你们
...it was your mistake

111
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
…而不是我
...not mine.

112
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,100
你们要是胡乱控诉我
You charge me with this shit...

113
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
…我一定会反诉你们
...and I'll beat it.

114
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,000
明白吗？
Okay?

115
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,800
继续说卡车的事吧，混蛋
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

116
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
真该有人管管这破事
Really, somebody's got to do something about this shit.

117
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,800
他们动不动就找我麻烦，我真是受够了
They put me in holding every five minutes. So I did a little time.

118
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,300
难道说每丢辆卡车，就都得把我关进来？
Does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds it's way gone?

119
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,700
让他们去死吧
Fuck 'em.

120
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,000
范斯特，放松点好吗？
Fenster, will you relax?

121
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,500
- 他们根本没有任何证据 - 你说的对，无凭无据
- These guys don't have any probable cause. - You fuckin' right. No PC.

122
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,100
真他妈说的太对了，只要曾犯过小错，他们就会揪住你不放
You're goddamn right. You do some time, never let you go.

123
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,600
他们当我是罪犯般看待
They treat me like a criminal.

124
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,700
- 那么我迟早也会变成个罪犯 - 你本来就是罪犯
- I'll end up a criminal. - You are a criminal.

125
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,700
干嘛说的那么直接？
Why'd you got to go and do that?

126
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,500
- 我只是在做假设 - 做你的假设去吧
- I'm trying to make a point. - Why don't you make your point?

127
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,800
你让我烦透了
You're making me tired all over.

128
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
去死吧
Fuck it then.

129
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,900
- 我听说你已经死了 - 是吗？
- I heard you were dead. - Yeah?

130
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
- 你没有听错 - 我听说的是你已经收手不干了
- You heard right. - Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

131
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,700
- 这是怎么回事？ - 究竟怎么说的？
- What's that all about? - What's this?

132
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,600
谣言说基顿已经改过自新，还和伊迪·菲娜琳打的火热
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight. I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

133
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
那是谁？
Who's that?

134
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,400
她是重量级的刑事辩护律师
She's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown.

135
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,400
听说她成了基顿的饭票
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

136
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
是吗，基顿？
How 'bout it, Keaton?

137
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,300
你有个当律师的妻子？
You a lawyer's wife?

138
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,000
你是怎么勾上她的？
What kind of retainer you giving her?

139
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,000
帮帮忙，让他保持安静
Do your friend a favor...tell him to keep quiet.

140
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,500
迪恩·基顿…
Dean Keaton...

141
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,600
改过自新？
Gone clean?

142
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,700
我觉得不可能
Say it ain't so.

143
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,300
- 还是说卡车就是你抢的？ - 麦克，算了吧
- Or was it you that hit that truck? - Mac, forget him.

144
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,900
你和律师谈过没有？
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

145
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
整件事情不过是借口
This whole thing was a shakedown.

146
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,200
- 为什么这么说？ - 你被指认过几次？
- What makes you say that? - How many times you been in a lineup?

147
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,600
通常总是你和四个不相干的人
It's always you and four dummies.

148
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,900
警方总找些流浪汉来，每次给他们十块
The PD are paying homeless guys $10 a head half the time.

149
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,400
他们不会同时把五个罪犯放在一起
There's no way they'd line five felons in the same row.

150
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,300
- 那声音指认呢？ - 那无非是形式
- What's a voice lineup?  - Public defender could get you out of that.

151
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,900
- 为什么要找上我？ - 是联邦调查局的家伙
- Why the hell was I strip searched? - It was the feds.

152
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,500
有辆运枪车被截下了
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

153
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,300
海关的人到纽约警局要答案，于是他们来找我们的麻烦
Customs comes down on NYPD for answers. They come up with us.

154
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,700
- 他们把我们当成救命稻草 - 我们就这么被他们玩
- They're clutching at straws. - I had a guy's finger up my ass.

155
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,100
现在是星期五了吗？
Is it Friday already?

156
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,400
是的，花花公子
Yeah, lover boy.

157
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,700
想被人修理吗？来吧，我会好好疼你的
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

158
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,500
那么到底是他妈的哪个人渣抢的货车？
So who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck?

159
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
- 你说什么？ - 是谁偷了那货车？
- What did you say? - Who stole the fucking truck?

160
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,700
- 我不想知道 - 没人问你，正经人
- I don't want to know. - Who asked you, workingman?

161
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,500
做这事的人去死吧，我现在想知道那跛子是什么人？
Fuck who did it. What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

162
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,900
- 没他的事  - 全是你在说，我怎么知道？
- He's okay. - Says you. How do I know that?

163
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,000
怎么样，拐脚佬？说说你的故事吧
What about it, pretzel man? What's your story?

164
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,400
他叫“口水先生”
His name is Verbal.

165
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
维伯·肯特
Verbal Kint.

166
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,000
- “口水先生”？ - 对
- Verbal? - Yeah.

167
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,200
真名是罗杰，人人说我话太多
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

168
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,400
我正想叫你闭嘴
I was going to tell you to shut up.

169
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,200
- 我们以前见过一二次 - 是在州局，我因为诈骗罪被逮进了局子
- We met before, once or twice. - In County. I was in for fraud.

170
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,500
我们曾一同被指认，后来如何了？
You were in a lineup then, too. What happened?

171
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,500
被判了90天，缓刑释放
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

172
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,600
- 你也不是个好人 - 好了，大家听我说…
- So you did it. - All right, now look...

173
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,700
…我们都因这事被搅进来
...we've all been put out by this whole thing, right?

174
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,600
我想我们该设法挽回点面子
I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity.

175
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,400
我和范斯特听说有桩生意
Now, me and Fenster heard about a little job.

176
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
安静会儿好吗？
Why don't you just calm down?

177
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,700
听他说说又怎么了？
What do you care what he has to say?

178
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,700
我不过随便说说
I'm just talking here.

179
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,200
看来哈肯尼先生，似乎想听我要说什么…
It seems to me like Mr.Hockney wants to hear it...

180
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
…而我知道范斯特亦有兴趣
...and I know Fenster's down.

181
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,800
你呢？伙计
What about you, guy?

182
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
当然有兴趣
I'm interested.

183
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,100
看到没？
There. See?

184
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,500
我只想行使我的自由集会权
I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly.

185
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,500
闭会儿嘴不行吗？
Why don't you just shut up?

186
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,100
你是不明白
You're missing the point.

187
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,900
不
No.

188
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,900
不明白的人是你
You're missing the point.

189
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,600
我不想听你说任何事
I don't want to hear anything from you.

190
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
我对你的生意没兴趣
I don't care about your job.

191
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,100
此外…
And...

192
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,800
…我不想和你们有任何关联
...I want nothing to do with any of you.

193
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,500
我很抱歉这么说，但你们全都见鬼去吧
I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell.

194
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,500
迪恩·基顿…
Dean Keaton...

195
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
…想正经做人
...gone the high road.

196
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,400
这世界是怎么了？
What is the world coming to?

197
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
去他的
Fuck him.

198
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,000
事情就是这么开始的:
And that was how it started:

199
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,500
我们五个因为莫须有的罪名
Five of us brought in on a trumped-up charge...

200
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,500
…被这些低能儿关了进来
...to be leaned on by half-wits.

201
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,300
在这儿我真不能多说
I really can't talk about it much here.

202
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,000
警察们永远也想不到的是…
What the cops never figured out, and what I know now...

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,300
…这些人永远不会屈服
...was that these men would never break, never lie down.

204
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,300
永远不会屈服于任何人
Never bend over for anybody.

205
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
任何人都不行
Anybody.

206
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:03,103
圣佩德罗  加利福尼亚  当日 

207
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,700
- 你是谁？ - FBI探员 杰克·拜尔
- Who are you? - Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

208
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
- 死了多少人？ - 迄今为止发现15具尸体
- How many dead? - 15 so far.

209
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,900
还在继续打捞水下的尸体
They're still pulling bodies out of the water.

210
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
- 有生还者吗？ - 有两个
- Any survivors? - Two.

211
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,900
一个被送进了州立医院，但他正在昏迷中
One guy's in County hospital, but he's in a coma.

212
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,000
地方检察官带走了另一个家伙，一个跛脚的纽约人
The DA has a second guy, a cripple from New York.

213
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,500
上头下令封锁现场
The chief wants this place sealed off.

214
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,400
要是有别的问题， 就给他们电话吧
If you have any questions, give him a call.

215
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,800
我是奎恩，我去了洛杉矶，星期二才回来
This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

216
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,100
若有急事，可联系圣佩德罗警署的杰夫·拉宾…
If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro Police Department...

217
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
…找内线112即可，祝你顺利
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.

218
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,199
圣佩德罗警署  洛杉矶市

219
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
- 我为什么不能见他？ - 我已经说了…
- Why can't I see him? - I told you...

220
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
…地方检察官昨晚来这里
...the DA came down here last night ready to arraign...

221
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,600
…准备等他到了，就开始提审
...even before they moved him to County.

222
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
然后过了五分钟，肯特的律师露面了…
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

223
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,600
…地方检察官出来的时候，像是蔫了的茄子
...the DA comes out looking like the bogeyman smacked him around.

224
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,800
他们给他录了口供，并与他达成协议
They take his statement, and they cut him a deal.

225
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,900
- 他们以什么来起诉他？ - 非法持械，是轻罪
- Did they charge him with anything? - Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

226
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,700
究竟是怎么回事？
What is that?

227
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,900
这里的事情已经全部移交给地方检察官，明白吗？
I give the DA credit for getting that much, you understand?

228
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
请让一下
Excuse me, sir.

229
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,700
整件事情开始有政治色彩，市长昨晚来过了
This whole thing has turned political. The mayor was here last night.

230
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,100
今天早上州长也曾打电话给头儿
The chief. This morning, the governor called, okay?

231
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,400
我告诉你，这家伙的后台很硬
I'm telling you, this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

232
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,900
- 记得我说的话吧 - 他什么时候可保释外出？
- Take my word for it. - When does he post bail?

233
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,200
- 可能最多再过两小时 - 我想要见见他
- Maybe two hours, tops. - I want to see him.

234
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,100
- 不行 - 我一定得见他
- No. - I gotta see him.

235
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,800
- 不，不行-- - 你得帮我
- No. I can't-- - You gotta do this for me.

236
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,100
我大老远来就是为了这事
I came a long way for this.

237
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,300
请进
Dave, please.

238
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,600
就算我让你见他，他也什么都不会说的
Even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you.

239
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,000
他会觉得是在被审问
He's paranoid about being recorded.

240
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,600
- 他知道审讯室里满布机关 - 我戒烟了
- He knows the rooms are wired. - I quit.

241
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
我不是审讯他，只不过随便谈谈罢了
This won't be an interrogation, just a friendly chat.

242
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,000
- 他不会进审讯室的 - 那就去别的地方
- He won't go into the interrogation room. - Then someplace else.

243
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
哪里呢？
Where?

244
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,500
不行，不行
No, no.

245
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,400
若这是毒品交易，那毒品呢？ 如果是谋杀，那又是谁指使的？
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope? If it was a hit, who called it?

246
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,000
我相信这些问题，在你心里已经有了答案
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions.

247
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,400
- 你很清楚我的想法 - 这简直太疯狂了，而且也没什么意义
- You know what I think. - That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

248
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,300
这家伙根本不知情，他的背景也已经查出来了
The guy's got total immunity. His story checks out.

249
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,900
- 他没有你想知道的答案 - 我知道他没有答案
- He doesn't know what you want to know. - I don't think he does, not exactly.

250
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,900
但事情没有那么简单，相信我
But there's a lot more to his story, believe me.

251
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,900
我想知道码头上那二十七人的死因
I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier...

252
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,300
这事与九千一百万毒品有关，但现场竟找不到毒品
...for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there.

253
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,900
此外，我想确认迪恩·基顿的死讯
And above all, I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

254
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,700
他确实死了
He's dead.

255
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
就给我两小时吧，到他被保释就结束
Come on. Two hours. Just till he makes bail.

256
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,900
他们都死了
They're all dead.

257
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
我才不在乎你说的，这个基顿有多厉害…
I don't care how tough you say Keaton was...

258
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,300
…船上没有生还的人
...nobody on that boat could've come out alive.

259
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
- 他能说话吗？ - 他醒来还不到一小时
- Is he talking? - He regained consciousness an hour ago.

260
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
说了些话，但不是英语，然后就停下了
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

261
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
- 是匈牙利语吗？ - 我不知道，也许是吧
- Hungarian? - That might have been it.

262
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,600
- 他们大部分是匈牙利人 - 你得把这穿上
- Most of them were Hungarians. - You gotta put this on.

263
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,300
烧伤病人很容易感染病菌
Burn victims are very susceptible to infection.

264
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,300
还有，那儿是禁烟的
And, of course, there's no smoking.

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,600
请戴上口罩，还有别去碰他
Keep your mask up. Please don't touch him.

266
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,800
他会死吗？
Is he gonna die?

267
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,600
他全身有六成被烧伤，肋骨断裂--
He's burned 60 percent of his body, broken ribs--

268
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,300
叫医院保安来，让人守在门口
Call security. Put a man on the door.

269
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,500
- 他会有危险？ - 对
- Is he dangerous? - Yes.

270
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
去吧
Do it.

271
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,900
快去
Do it now.

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
乔尔吗？我是拜尔，从洛杉矶给你打来的
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

273
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,500
他们在码头找到的那人，叫阿科西·卡瓦什
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

274
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,400
是的，我明白
Yes, I'm sure.

275
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,600
不，他受了重伤
No, he's all fucked up.

276
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,100
我听不清
I can't hear you.

277
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,800
闭会儿嘴好吗？我在打电话
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

278
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
对
Yes.

279
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,300
不，直到我派人来看着他
No, not till I put a man on him.

280
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,800
派个会说匈牙利语的人来
Send me someone who can speak Hungarian.

281
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,700
他已经醒了，这家伙说话就像个泰国妓女
He's awake. He's talking like a Thai hooker.

282
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,100
凯撒·苏斯
Keyser Soze.

283
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,700
- 什么？ - 凯撒·苏斯！
- What? - Keyser Soze!

284
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
这是怎么了？
No shit?

285
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,100
到法院去找丹·曼徹斯特
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

286
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,700
…还有海关的大卫·奎恩
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

287
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,000
维伯，这是海关的奎恩探员
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

288
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,300
幸会
Nice to meet you.

289
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,900
他想在你离开前问几个问题
He wants to ask you a few questions before you go.

290
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,500
- 什么问题？ - 大部分是关于迪恩·基顿的
- What about? - About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

291
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,200
但我想先从在纽约的指认谈起
I'd like to start at the lineup back in New York.

292
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,600
- 我能喝杯咖啡吗？ - 稍后再说吧，先说说指认时的事
- Can I get some coffee? - In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

293
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,100
我真的很口渴，我就像小孩子那样容易脱水
I'm really thirsty. I used to dehydrate as a kid.

294
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,500
有次我尿出的小便就象鼻涕一样
Once I got so bad my piss come out like snot.

295
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
- 就是那种又浓又粘的-- - 我去给你弄咖啡
- It was all thick and gooey-- - I'll get your fucking coffee.

296
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,200
顺便帮我也冲一杯
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

297
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,300
那家伙太紧张了
That guy is tense.

298
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
紧张足以使人致命
Tension is a killer.

299
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,300
我曾经加入过在伊利诺州斯科基的一个男声四重唱组合
I used to be in a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.

300
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,300
男中音就叫基普·迪斯金， 是个超级大胖子
The baritone was this guy named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

301
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
他每天早上都紧张的要命--
Like, orca fat. He was so stressed in the morning--

302
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,100
- 我们现在是想帮你 - 谢谢，我很感激
- You know we're trying to help you. - Sure, and I appreciate that.

303
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,300
我也想帮你，奎恩探员，我喜欢警察
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops.

304
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,000
我曾梦想成为联邦探员，可是我的--
I would've liked to have been a fed, but my CP--

305
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
你没对我们说实话，我知道你清楚一切
You're not tellin' us everything. I know you know something.

306
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
我已经对地方检察官全交待了
I told the DA everything I know.

307
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,500
我知道你喜欢基顿
I know you like Keaton.

308
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,700
- 我明白你认为他是好人 - 我知道他很好
- I know you think he's a good man. - I know he was good.

309
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
他曾是个贪污的警察
He was a corrupt cop.

310
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,000
对，15年前的事了，他还是个好贼
Sure. 15 years ago, but he was a good thief.

311
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,700
警察不会让他的行为合法化
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

312
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,900
迪恩·基顿是垃圾
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

313
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,800
你想从我身上得到点什么？
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

314
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,700
- 我只想听听你的故事 - 已经全说了
- I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.

315
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,300
能抽支烟吗？
May I have a cigarette?

316
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,400
- 根据你的口供-- - 给个火
- According to your statement-- - I need a light.

317
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,800
根据你的口供，你只是个小毛贼…
According to your statement, you're a short-con operator...

318
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,500
…不入流的--
...run-of-the-mill--

319
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,300
根据你的口供，你只是个小毛贼…
According to your statement, you're a short-con operator...

320
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,600
…不入流的骗子
...run-of-the-mill scams.

321
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,500
这些口供应该已经被封存了
It's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.

322
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,900
我知道，你做了桩好交易，你已经被完全豁免
I know. Sweet deal you have here. Total immunity.

323
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,500
我因非法持枪罪被起诉，还有六个月的日子得熬
I do have the weapons charge. I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

324
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,700
认识一个叫鲁比·迪莫的商人吗？
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

325
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,200
认识一个叫约翰·保罗的教徒吗？
You know a religious guy named John Paul?

326
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
- 知道阿提卡的鲁比吗？ - 我和他没什么瓜葛
- You know Ruby's in Attica? - He didn't have my lawyer.

327
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,400
我认识鲁比，他很受人尊敬
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

328
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,900
他是我的好朋友，也很喜欢我
He's a good friend of mine, likes me very much.

329
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
我知你的证供已被封存，可鲁比交游广阔
I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby's well connected.

330
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,800
有许多朋友愿为他效力
He's got lots of friends inside who do favors for him.

331
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,700
如果他知道你把他的名字供给了地方检察官，知道他会怎么做吗？
What would he say if he found out you dropped his name to the DA?

332
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,500
- 上面根本没提鲁比的事 - 可我会这么对他说
- There's nothing there on Ruby. - I'll be sure to mention that to him.

333
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,600
知道我从这行学了什么？ 就是如何认出凶手
Know what I've learned on the job? How to spot a murderer.

334
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
假设捉了宗谋杀案的三个疑犯
Say you arrest three guys for the same killing.

335
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,600
你把他们关通宵
Put them in jail overnight.

336
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
到了第二天早上，谁要是睡着了，谁就是凶手
Next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man.

337
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,700
如果你犯了罪，等到被捕，你的戒心就松懈了
If you're guilty, you know you're caught. You let your guard down.

338
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,000
- 明白吗？ - 不
- You follow me? - No.

339
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,700
让我开门见山的直说
Let me get to the point.

340
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,700
我比你聪明， 我会查出我要知的事
I'm smarter than you, and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

341
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,100
无论你是否喜欢，我都会查出真相
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

342
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,800
我也不是鼠辈
I'm not a rat.

343
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
谢谢
Thanks.

344
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,500
我曾在危地马拉尝过咖啡豆磨的新鲜咖啡
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.

345
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,600
直接从树上摘下的那种，好喝极了
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

346
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,500
- 这味道糟透了，谁让我是在警察局里呢  - 能继续吗？
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station. - Can we get started again?

347
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,800
指认结束后怎样了？
What happened after the lineup?

348
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,700
那值班的对我说不能保释你
The desk sergeant was telling me he couldn't release you.

349
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,000
你能相信吗？你甚至未被起诉
Can you believe that? You weren't even charged.

350
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
该死的警察
Damn police.

351
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,600
我要给你的脸拍照
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

352
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,800
 -明天就送到地方检察官那儿 - 算了吧
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow. - Forget about it.

353
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,600
星期一我就会把这事报到大陪审团去
I'll have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.

354
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,600
我不想再谈这事了
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

355
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
弗提和雷诺那边怎么说？
What did Fortier and Renault say?

356
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,600
他们需要多些时间考虑投资
They asked for more time to think about investing.

357
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
该死的
Damn it.

358
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,400
需要多些时间干什么？
More time for what?

359
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,400
无论你怎么掩饰我的过去，他们还是会查到我的底细
No matter how you cover my tracks they're still gonna find out about me.

360
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,600
相信我
Give me some credit.

361
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,200
我会帮你澄清的，我们一起去庭内合议
I got you this far. Let's go to the grand jury.

362
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,400
- 如果不这样，这事不会停-- - 这事永远不会停
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't-- - It's never going to stop, period.

363
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,200
下星期所有投资者都将抛弃我们
By next week, every investor in the city is gonna be walking away from us.

364
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,100
完了
It's finished.

365
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,800
我徹底完了
I'm finished.

366
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,600
别轻言放弃，基顿
Don't give up on me now.

367
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
这事永远也不会停
It's never gonna stop.

368
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,300
我爱你
I love you.

369
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,700
他们今晚毁了我
They ruined me in there tonight.

370
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,000
我爱你
I love you.

371
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
你听到了吗？
Do you hear me?

372
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,100
什么？
What?

373
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,000
好了
All right.

374
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
去我家吧
Let's just go to my place.

375
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
明天再想这些烦事
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

376
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,100
走吧
Let's go.

377
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,300
范斯特和麦克麦纳斯有个很好的计划:
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition:

378
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,900
钱来的快，风险高，利润也大
A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.

379
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,100
我们都知道那行得通
We all knew it could be done.

380
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,000
我想那事若是办坏了就得杀人
The way I figured, to do it wrong meant killing.

381
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
可要办好就要集齐五个人
To do it right took five men.

382
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
五个人的关键就是基顿
Five men meant Keaton.

383
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,900
基顿总是令人信服的
Keaton took convincing.

384
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,600
纽约警察出租公司
New York's finest taxi service.

385
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,700
胡说
Bullshit.

386
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,800
胡说
Bullshit.

387
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
他们早就已经不干了
They don't operate anymore.

388
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,400
麦克麦纳斯有个朋友在十四区，他们星期四收到了风声
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct. They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

389
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,400
他们准备收拾一个从南非走私宝石的家伙
They're pickin' up a guy smuggling emeralds from South America.

390
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,300
麦克麦纳斯已经找到了销赃人
McManus already has a fence set up.

391
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
- 销赃人？是谁？ - 是个加州人，叫雷德福特
- A fence? Who? - Some guy in California called Redfoot.

392
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
- 我从未听说过这家伙 - 你一定要来
- I never heard of him. - You have to come.

393
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,900
- 我来与不来，与你何干？ - 他们不认识我，只认识你
- What's it to you whether I do it or not? - They don't know me. You do.

394
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,500
除非你一起干，否则他们不信我
They won't take me unless you go.

395
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,600
替我想想，我需要这笔钱
Look at me. I need this.

396
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,900
难道你就不需要？这是你家吗？
You're telling me you don't need this? Is this your place?

397
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,800
我不是在打击你，难道你就打算跟着这律师吃软饭？
I'm not knocking you. You got a good scam going with this lawyer.

398
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,700
对不起
Sorry.

399
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,600
算了
It's okay.

400
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,500
你说得不错
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

401
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,300
你没事吧？
You okay?

402
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,400
我已经洗手不干
I was out of line.

403
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,100
可他们仍不放过我们，你很明白这点
But they're never gonna stop with us. You know that.

404
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,900
即使像你般清白，他们仍缠着你
As clean as you get, they'll never let you go now.

405
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,000
这么干，既能给警察们颜色看， 同时我们也得了好处
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts, and we get well in the meantime.

406
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,500
你真的没事吗？
You sure you're okay?

407
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,500
会没事的
I'll be all right.

408
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,400
你看…
Look, I...

409
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,600
- …我有时候-- - 别说了
- ...sometimes get-- - Forget it.

410
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,400
我今晚可能会泻血
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

411
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,600
那么…
So...

412
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,200
…他们想怎么下手？
...how do they wanna do it?

413
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,400
麦克麦纳斯想开杀戒，可我反对
McManus wants to go in shooting. I say no.

414
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,200
范斯特呢？哈肯尼呢？
Fenster? Hockney?

415
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,100
他们都豁出去了，什么都干的出来
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything.

416
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,600
我有条不用杀任何人的路
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

417
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,900
可就像我说的，没有你，他们不会让我加入
But like I say, they won't let me in without you.

418
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,400
三百万？
$3 million?

419
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,800
也许更多
Maybe more.

420
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,800
不杀人
No killing.

421
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,300
只要依我的方法行事便成
Not if we do it my way.

422
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,500
纽约警察出租车公司是个地下称呼
New York's finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service.

423
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,500
那是纽约贪污警察的生财工具…
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD that ran a high-profit racket...

424
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,100
…他们接载走私客和毒贩
...driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city.

425
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,800
付上每公里三百元的价钱，你就有了私人的蓝白警察卫队
For $300 a mile, you got your own blue and white...

426
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,900
他们甚至还备有名片
...and a police escort. They even had their own business cards.

427
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,200
没过多久，有人提出了质询，而这计程车服务亦告终结
After a while, somebody started asking questions, and the taxi service shut down.

428
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,900
随后内政部的人将涉案的人都拘捕了
Ever since then, Internal Affairs has been waiting to catch them in the act.

429
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,600
我们就对那伙人下手
That's where we came in.

430
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,100
- 旅程愉快吗？ - 好的很
- So, how was the flight? - Fuckin' great.

431
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,400
用这车能送我去斯坦顿岛吗？
Will this get me to Staten Island?

432
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,900
开什么玩笑？ 就是把你送到科德角去也行
Are you kiddin' me? This will get you to Cape Cod.

433
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,900
麦克麦纳斯去接生意，范斯特安排车辆
McManus came to us with the job. Fenster got the vans.

434
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,600
哈肯尼提供枪械
Hockney supplied the hardware.

435
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,300
我则想办法不让人被杀
I came through with how to do it so no one got killed.

436
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,000
基顿？基顿把整件事添上最后一笔
But Keaton? Keaton put on the finishing touch.

437
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,700
稍有差错，我们五人将落到警方手上
A little "fuck you" from the five of us to the NYPD.

438
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
看着点
Watch this.

439
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
小心
Careful.

440
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,400
真该死
Come on, asshole!

441
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,100
天啊！
Holy shit!

442
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,200
- 别动，混蛋！ - 把枪放下，杂种！
- Don't move, you fucker! - Drop it now, motherfucker!

443
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,400
把他妈的枪丢掉！快丢掉！
Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!

444
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,500
别他妈的碰任何东西
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

445
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,200
- 你们想要干什么？ - 把那该死的东西拿开
- What do you guys want? - Put your fuckin' thing away.

446
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
我们是警察，蠢货！
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

447
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,000
- 小心玻璃！ - 别动，杂种！
- Watch the glass! - Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

448
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,400
- 想尝颗子弹吗？胖子 - 闭嘴！
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby? - Shut up!

449
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,400
他妈的
Fuck.

450
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,400
下午好，兄弟，把东西给我
'Afternoon, my little pork chops. Give me the shit.

451
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,100
- 别动！ - 把那东西给他！
- Don't move! - Give him the shit!

452
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
快把那该死的东西给他！
Give him the fuckin' thing!

453
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,100
快把那该死的东西给他！
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

454
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,500
快点！拿来！
Hurry up! Come on!

455
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,800
- 还有钱 - 没有钱了
- Now the money! - There's no money.

456
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,900
- 把钱交出来！ - 根本没有钱
- Give me the money now! - There's no fuckin' money.

457
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
把钱给他！
Give him the fuckin' money!

458
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,300
- 快！把钱给他！ - 把钱给我！
- Do it! Give him the money! - Give me the money!

459
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,800
- 把钱给他！ - 快点！
- Give him the money! - Hurry up!

460
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,800
你们知道我是谁吗？
You know who the fuck I am?

461
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,700
你们这些家伙知道我是谁吗？ 他妈的！
You people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!

462
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,100
现在知道了
We do now, jerk-off.

463
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,200
混蛋
Cocksucker.

464
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
等等，那算什么？
Wait a minute. What's that?

465
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,500
这到底算什么？
What the fuck?

466
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,400
天啊！
Holy shit!

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,100
走！
Go!

468
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,000
基顿打了个匿名电话
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.

469
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,700
新闻界与警察一起抵达现场
The press was on the scene before the police were.

470
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,200
三日后，施特劳斯和瑞兹被起诉
Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three days later.

471
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,100
不到几个星期，又有50多个警察也被起诉
Within a few weeks, 50 more cops went down with them.

472
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,100
这案子牵连很广，直到挖出了他们的头脑
Everybody got it right in the ass, from the chief on down.

473
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,800
干的漂亮极了
It was beautiful.

474
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
我欠你两块半
I owe you $2.50.

475
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,500
基顿博士
Dr.Keaton.

476
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,800
- 比我想的要多 - 销赃的家伙什么时候到？
- There's more here than I thought. - When's the fence coming?

477
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,800
雷德福特不会主动来见我，一般都是我去找他
Redfoot never comes to see me. I always go to see him.

478
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,700
在加州？
In California?

479
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,600
是的，维伯，在加州           范斯特和我--
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I--

480
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,700
等等，先收声，你和范斯特？不行
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster? No.

481
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,000
- 你们想耍我？ - 那么派谁去？
- You fuckin' kiddin' me? - So then, who's gonna go?

482
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,100
我们一起去
We all go.

483
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,200
你有什么问题吗？伙计
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

484
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,900
我的问题就是，你和范斯特会在加州逍遥快活
My problem, is you and Fenster honeymooning in California...

485
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,000
…而把我们甩在这里提心吊胆
...while the rest of us are sittin' here holding our dicks.

486
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,700
已经完事了
The job's over.

487
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
冷静点
Cool it.

488
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,800
洛杉矶是个轻松的好地方
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

489
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
想要跳舞吗？
You wanna dance?

490
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,700
变态
Ladies.

491
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,500
我提议大家干一杯
I would like to propose a toast.

492
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
敬你的
There you go.

493
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,500
为足智多谋的…
To Mr.Verbal...

494
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
…“口水先生”而干
...the man with the plan.

495
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,900
我们会错过班机的
We're gonna miss the flight.

496
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,100
别傻等了，给她留张便条就行了
Don't do this. Send her a note. Something.

497
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,700
我说了来得及的
I said we'll make it.

498
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,700
我们快要误机了
We're gonna miss the plane.

499
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
她会理解的
She'll understand.

500
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
那真的很感人
That's heartwarming. Really.

501
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,100
我有点想哭了
I'm weepy.

502
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
到外面去等好吗？
You wanna wait outside?

503
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,700
是你们想知道发生的事，我正和你们说实话
You guys wanted to know what happened. I'm telling you.

504
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,200
继续吧，维伯
Come on, Verbal.

505
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,300
你以为我是谁？你要我相信他真会洗手不干？
Who do you think you're talkin' to? You expect me to believe that he retired?

506
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,700
就为了个女人？
For a woman?

507
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,200
胡扯，基顿是在利用她
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

508
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,900
- 他爱他 - 没错
- He loved her. - Sure.

509
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,400
我很难相信袭击出租车，不是他的主意
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea.

510
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,300
- 是范斯特和麦克麦纳斯提出的 - 基顿做了四年的警察
- It was all Fenster and McManus. - Keaton was a cop for four years.

511
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,200
谁会比他知道的更清楚？
Who else would know better?

512
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,100
- 他已经是臭名远扬 - 但伊迪使他全改变了
- That job had his name on it. - Edie had him turned around.

513
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
让我这么告诉你吧
Let me tell you something.

514
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,100
我了解迪恩·基顿
I know Dean Keaton.

515
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,000
过去四年我一直在调查他
I've been investigating him for the past three years.

516
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,600
我知道这家伙是个冷血的杂种
The guy I know was a cold-blooded bastard.

517
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,200
警队开除他前，已有三次被控谋杀
IAD indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force.

518
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,600
别告诉我妓女也有颗金子般的心
Don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold.

519
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,200
你完全误会了他
You got him all wrong.

520
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,500
是吗？
Do I?

521
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,400
迪恩·基顿在警队时，已有七次被控罪的记录
Dean Keaton was under indictment seven times while he was on the force.

522
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,000
每次不是证人翻供
In every case, witnesses either reversed their testimony...

523
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,000
…就是在出庭前就被干掉
...or died before they could testify.

524
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,100
等到终于能把他入罪，并送进州立新新监狱关上五年
When they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in Sing Sing.

525
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,200
他却在里面杀了三个囚犯
He killed three prisoners inside.

526
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,000
当然，我不能证明此事
Of course, I can't prove this...

527
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,900
…但我亦不能证明他没有做
...but I can't prove the best part either.

528
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,900
迪恩·基顿死过一次
Dean Keaton was dead.

529
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,200
你知道那故事吗？
Did you know that?

530
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,200
两年前他在调查一宗…
He died in a fire two years ago, during an investigation into the murder...

531
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,400
…证人被杀案时葬身火海
...of a witness who was going to testify against him.

532
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,400
有两人见到迪恩·基顿在爆炸前进了货仓
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into a warehouse he owned...just before it blew up.

533
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,900
他们说他去检查煤气是否泄漏
They said he went in to check a leaking gas main.

534
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,700
结果迪恩·基顿就此葬身火海
It blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.

535
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,900
爆炸发生三个月后，那两个目击者也死了
Within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead.

536
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
一个是在车内自杀
One killed himself in his car.

537
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,500
另一个从电梯跌下而死
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

538
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,700
让我们快开始吧
Let's get this show on the road.

539
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,500
我们说好了不能这样，现在有太多--
This is not what we discussed. There are too many--

540
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,400
我答应他死之前我们会离开
I promise we'll be out before he blows his porch light.

541
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,900
- 我中午还有会要开 - 只能待五分钟
- I have a noon meeting. - Five minutes.

542
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,800
好，所有人要冷静点
Everyone calm down, all right?

543
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,300
我要你问他码头枪战的事
I want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor.

544
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
- 他说他们在买-- - 是毒品，我们知道
- He says they were buying-- - Dope. We know.

545
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,700
他不知道他们要买什么，但肯定不是毒品
He doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope.

546
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,100
- 是人 - 什么？
- People. - What?

547
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,800
他需要保证…
He needs guarantees...

548
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,100
- 他说什么？保证？ - 他说他有生命危险
- What is he talking about, guarantees? - He says his life is in danger.

549
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,200
他见到有只魔鬼在望着他
He saw the Devil. Looked him in the eye.

550
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,900
- 我得走了 - 不，再等等
- I'm on my way. - No, wait a minute.

551
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,500
问他那个他说过的…
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

552
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,000
…那个魔鬼的事
...about the Devil.

553
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,000
魔鬼是谁？
Who's the Devil?

554
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,600
凯撒·苏斯
Keyser Soze.

555
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,900
凯撒·苏斯？
Keyser Soze?

556
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,800
他在码头上杀了许多人
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

557
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
他看见了凯撒·苏斯？
He saw Keyser Soze?

558
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,200
- 他看到了他的脸 - 好，好
- He saw his face. - All right.

559
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,200
让他告诉她，那人的长相是怎样的
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

560
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,100
形容出来
Describe him.

561
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,200
六星期前，我接到匿名电话…
Six weeks ago, I get an anonymous phone call...

562
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,300
…说能在蒙第诺餐厅找到基顿，事实上他确实在
...telling me I can find Keaton eating at Mondino's, and there he is.

563
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,100
由于他伪称已死并没什么利益
Because he never profited from his alleged death...

564
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,700
…也因为我们已找到真正的凶手
...and we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him...

565
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
…所以只得让他走
...we had to let him go.

566
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,600
他伪称死去的时间已经够长，足以平息那宗谋杀案的影响
He was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over.

567
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
于是他就开始露面吃午餐了
And then he had lunch.

568
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,800
我对那一无所知
I don't know about that.

569
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,600
我不认为你知道什么，可你说看见基顿死了
I don't think you do, but you say you saw Keaton die.

570
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,400
我在想你可能是为他掩饰，而他仍藏身在某处
I think you're covering his ass, and he's still out there.

571
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,800
我认为他就是码头枪战的幕后主使
I think he's behind that circus at the harbor.

572
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,400
他利用你是因为你笨，而且认为自己是他的朋友
My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and think he's your friend.

573
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,700
你对我说他已死，就当他死了
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

574
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,000
我只想在回纽约前确定他已死
I wanna be sure before I go back to New York.

575
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
他根本不是幕后主使，那是个律师
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.

576
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,900
什么律师？
What lawyer?

577
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
什么律师？
What lawyer?

578
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,600
在我还在男声四重唱组时--
Back when I was in that barbershop quartet--

579
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,100
你以为我不知道，你隐瞒了地方检察官？
You don't think I know you held out on the DA?

580
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,800
你到底隐瞒了什么？
What did you leave out?

581
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,200
我能在十分钟内就找到鲁比
I could be on the phone to Ruby in 10 minutes.

582
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,900
- 地方检察官已经将我豁免 - 我还没有
- The DA gave me immunity. - Not from me.

583
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,500
我并没有豁免你，混蛋
You get no immunity from me, you piece of shit.

584
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,100
我将所有罪犯关在狱中，每个警察都感激我…
Every criminal I have put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor...

585
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,800
…所有犯罪的大小角色…
...every creep and scumbag that walks the street...

586
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,500
…都会知道维伯·肯特的大名…
...will know the name of Verbal Kint. You talk to me...

587
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,100
…你给我老实交待，不然你获得的珍贵豁免权…
...or that precious immunity they grant you...

588
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,500
…绝不会交到你手上
...won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.

589
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,300
还有个律师
There was a lawyer.

590
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
叫小林
Kobayashi.

591
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,400
- 就是他杀了基顿？ - 不是，但我肯定基顿已经死了
- Is he the one that killed Keaton? - No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

592
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,800
说服我相信
Convince me.

593
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,700
把详情原原本本说出来
Tell me every last detail.

594
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,500
我们抵达洛杉矶去会麦克麦纳斯的销赃人，雷德福特
We arrived in Los Angeles and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.

595
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,100
他有着不错的名声，似乎是个好人
He had a good reputation. Seemed like a good guy.

596
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,400
- 可我们还得多了解 - 还好吗？
- Still, we should have known better. - How you doing?

597
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,500
- 还好，你呢？ - 也不坏，马马虎虎了
- Good. You? - Not bad. Can't complain.

598
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,300
你怎么样，范斯特？
How's it going, Fenster?

599
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,300
不需要打开吧？
Don't need to open it, right?

600
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,900
你一定是基顿
You must be Keaton.

601
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,800
这是雷德福特，这是迪恩·基顿
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

602
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
- 托德·霍克尼，还有维伯·肯特.  - 计谋多多的维伯？
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint. - Verbal, the man with the plan.

603
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,400
有兴趣再干一把吗？
You interested in more work?

604
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,200
- 我们一直在找活干 - 我们在休假
- We're always looking for extra work. - We're on vacation.

605
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,200
那真可惜
That's too bad.

606
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,800
我有大堆的活，可惜就是找不到好手
I got a ton of work and no good people.

607
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
- 要像你们这般身手的 - 有什么活？
- Not like you guys. - What's the job?

608
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,300
有个从德克萨斯州来的珠宝商，叫索尔
There's this jeweler out of Texas named Saul.

609
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,500
他在市中心的酒店租了间套房
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

610
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,200
他免费为人鉴定价格，有时会买，有时却不买
He does free appraisals. Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

611
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,000
简而言之，他手上有大笔现金
The word is, he carries around a lot of cash.

612
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,900
我想的就是，我可以收货，而你拿现钞
So I figure, I keep the merchandise, you keep the green.

613
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,700
- 简单的很 - 安全方面如何？
- Simple. - What about security?

614
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,100
有两个保镖，你们完全可以搞定
A couple of bodyguards. Nothing you couldn't handle.

615
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,100
可以给我时间考虑吗？
Give me time to check it out?

616
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,600
我从来不会对你失望，兄弟
I expect nothing less from you, man.

617
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
很高兴见到你，电话联系吧
Good to see you. We'll call you.

618
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,500
好好的在洛杉矶享受
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

619
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,900
有个纽约朋友告诉我，你认识斯伯克·霍利斯
A friend in New York tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.

620
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,000
我听说你曾和他一同服过刑
The way I hear it, you did time with ol' Spook.

621
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,900
他是个好人
A good man, wasn't he?

622
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
我以前曾为他贩过毒
I used to run dope for him.

623
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,100
可惜挂了
Too bad he got shivved.

624
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,300
是我把他干掉的
I shivved him.

625
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,400
这事直接由我告诉你，总比以后别人传给你好
Better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later.

626
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,500
谢谢你告诉我
I appreciate that.

627
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,400
恕我好奇…
But just out of curiosity...

628
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,600
这纯粹是公事，抑或私人问题？
...was it business or personal?

629
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,500
两者都是
A bit of both.

630
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,800
就如我说的…
Like I said...

631
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,000
…若你有兴趣，可给我电话
...you give me a call if you're interested.

632
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,900
有问题吗？
Is there a problem?

633
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,800
只干一次
One job.

634
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,900
就是这样
That was the deal.

635
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,400
只干一次？
One job?

636
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,700
只干一次？
One job?

637
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,300
说的真好
That's a good one.

638
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,100
基顿已经竭尽所能，但人不能改变身份
Keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is.

639
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,400
他可对人说他另一个身份，但始终不能摆脱自己
He can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself.

640
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,100
麦克麦纳斯整天都在唠叨，于是我们又干回本行
It took one day with McManus nagging, and we went back to work.

641
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,300
于是我下了车，那事全被搅了
I get out of my car, and the thing is wrecked.

642
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,900
我向另外那辆车的后座看去，那女人几乎全脱光了
I look in the backseat of the other car, and this woman's totally naked.

643
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,100
- 我笑到快透不过气来   - 上车吧，索尔
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe. - Get in the car, Saul.

644
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,000
- 别动，混蛋！ - 站着别动！
- Freeze, motherfucker! - Stay right there!

645
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,800
那边还有一个人
There's a second one here, somewhere.

646
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,800
把公文箱给我，快把公文箱给我！
Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!

647
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,400
快把公文箱给我，我讲最后一次…
Give me the fuckin' case. I'm tellin' you for the last time.

648
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,400
快把公文箱给我！
Give me the fuckin' case!

649
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,400
- 过来！ - 别动！
- Come on! - Don't move!

650
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,500
把箱子递出来
Hand over the case.

651
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,700
给我把箱子递出来
Hand over the fuckin' case.

652
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,300
好了，走吧！
Come on, let's go!

653
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,500
- 快！ - 今天真倒霉
- Come on! - Bad day. Fuck it.

654
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,800
快走了！
Let's go!

655
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,100
混蛋
Fuck.

656
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,900
- 就像是堆泥巴般毫无价值 - 真该死
- Looks like a lot of china to me. - Shit.

657
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,700
伙计们，来了
Guys, come on.

658
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,500
- 你想干什么？ - 我要杀了那家伙
- What are you doin'? - I'm gonna kill him.

659
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,700
我们已经按你的方式错了回，现在听我的
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

660
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,000
- 你要杀他吗？ - 我去和他谈
- You gonna kill him? - I'll deal with him.

661
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,900
- 你最好和他好好谈谈 - 闭嘴
- You'd better, or I'm gonna. - Shut up.

662
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,700
你叫我拿这东西有什么用？
What am I supposed to do with that?

663
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,200
拿来喂那跛子吧，能帮他止痛，我也对此不知情
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain. I don't know what that is.

664
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,300
- 什么意思？ - 我并不知情
- What do you mean? - I don't know.

665
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,600
是个律师叫我这么做的
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

666
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,700
是谁？
Who?

667
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,000
我不知道，是个英国佬
I don't know. Some limey.

668
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,800
他也只是个中间人，他没有说，我也没问 
He's a middleman for somebody. He doesn't say, I don't ask.

669
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,100
- 你真是个混蛋！ - 去死吧！
- You're fuckin' full of shit! - Fuck you.

670
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,900
- 你才去死吧！ - 听我说
- Fuck you. - Listen to me.

671
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
我们想要见他
We wanna meet him, okay?

672
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,100
那真巧了
That's funny.

673
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,500
昨晚他给我电话，也说想要见你们
He called me last night. He says he wants to meet you guys.

674
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,100
那好，我们去见他
Okay, we'll meet him.

675
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,400
- 我会给你电话 - 好，我们走
- I'll call you. - Good. Let's go.

676
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,800
我不想这样，等等，还有件事，坏小子:
I don't like it. Wait a minute. One more thing, tough guy:

677
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,100
再玩什么花样，我会做了你
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

678
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,500
就当帮我个忙好吗？
You're such a tough guy. But do me a favor, all right?

679
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,700
快在我面前消失
Get the fuck off my dick.

680
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,600
不要！
No!

681
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,500
好好管教管教那小子
Put a leash on that puppy.

682
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,900
索尔被杀真是糟糕透了
It's an awful shame about Saul gettin' whacked.

683
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,700
警察在追缉凶徒
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

684
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,400
他们迟早会来问我
Sooner or later, they're gonna come around askin' me.

685
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,100
祝你们晚安，小姐们
You have a sweet night, ladies.

686
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,200
去死吧
Fuck you.

687
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,400
- 那么这个律师-- - 小林
- So this lawyer-- - Kobayashi.

688
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,500
- 是雷德福特引来的？ - 对
- Came from Redfoot. - Right.

689
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,700
和地方检察官说的时候为何漏了这段？
And why leave this out when you talked to the DA?

690
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
大卫，有人找你
Dave, someone to see you.

691
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,300
我满世界的在找你
I've been looking all over for you.

692
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,000
仍在追查昨晚码头大屠杀的毒品？
You still after that coke that took a walk out of that bloodbath yesterday?

693
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,900
不用查了，根本没有毒品
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

694
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,600
我去州立医院找了那个从下水道救上的…
I've been in LA County talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe...

695
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,500
…昨晚枪战后的幸存者
...yesterday after the shootout.

696
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,700
今早他苏醒了，并说了些事情
He came to this morning, he started talking.

697
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,100
他是匈牙利匪帮的一员，他们预备和阿根廷党徒交易
He's part of a Hungarian mob. They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

698
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,700
他说这事与毒品交易无关
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

699
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,100
- 但是-- - 我知道，可他说这事与毒品无关
- But there were-- - We know. But he says no on the dope.

700
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,700
这匈牙利人告诉我 这班人第二天便要去土耳其
This Hungarian tells me they were pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

701
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,300
他们没时间去讨论那批货，也没考虑搬它
They had no time for that kind of product, and no means to move it.

702
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
- 那钱是做什么的？ - 他不知道
- What's the money for? - He didn't know.

703
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,700
除了几个关键人物外，无人知晓
No one doing the deal knew except for a few key people.

704
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,100
他说那些人都守口如瓶
They were all very hush about it, he says.

705
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,500
- 无论那是什么，都牵连重大 - 我不太明白
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive. - I don't get it.

706
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,900
你见到了那个跛脚的纽约人吗？
You got the cripple in there from New York?

707
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,500
他有提到凯撒·苏斯没？
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

708
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,100
谁？
Who?

709
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,600
请原谅我的打扰
Just bear with me here.

710
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,800
- 谁是凯撒·苏斯？ - 去死吧！
- Who's Keyser Soze? - Fuck!

711
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,000
我们已经争论了一个半小时
We've been goin' over this for an hour and a half.

712
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,300
我们只需要做了雷德福特，然后离开这该死的地方就行
What we need to do is find Redfoot and get the hell out of here now.

713
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
我们需要先思考周全
What we need to do is think.

714
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,100
再想想
Think back.

715
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,000
有人有能力…
Somebody with power...

716
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,700
…有人能从纽约 一直追查我们到这里
...somebody capable of tracking us from New York to LA.

717
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,800
- 那我们在这儿做什么？ - 我们得等待
- What the hell are we doing here? - We're waiting.

718
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,300
- 坐下    - 不用了，我火气大着，他妈烦透了
- Sit down. - No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

719
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,100
哈肯尼先生，停下
Mr.Hockney, do stay.

720
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,200
基顿先生
Mr.Keaton.

721
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,900
范斯特先生，我赏识他的枪法…
Mr.Fenster I recognize from his mug shots...

722
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,800
…就和麦克麦纳斯的一样好
...as well as Mr.McManus.

723
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,900
你一定就是肯特先生，那位干掉索尔伯格的人
I can only assume that you are Mr.Kint, the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

724
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,700
我的雇主致上他的感谢和一份意想不到的礼物
My employer sends his gratitude, a most unexpected benefit.

725
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,600
我就是小林先生
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

726
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,500
我的雇主要我带份建议书来
I have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

727
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,700
-你想怎样？ -我雇主想你们为他效劳
- What do you want? - My employer requires your services.

728
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,400
任务只得一个，工作一天，但相当危险
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

729
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,000
他没预计你们全部能活命…
He does not expect all of you to live. But those of you who do...

730
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,200
…但能活命的可将那九千一百万分了
...will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit.

731
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,000
谁是你的老板？
Who's your boss?

732
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,900
我为凯撒·苏斯做事
I work for Keyser Soze.

733
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,500
谁是凯撒·苏斯？
Who's Keyser Soze?

734
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,900
你太情绪化了，肯特先生
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

735
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,000
…我想你的合伙人也是这么认为的
...I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.

736
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,100
我代苏斯先生向你们提出建议
I come with an offer directly from Mr.Soze.

737
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,100
- 实际上是个命令 - 什么叫做“命令”？
- An order, actually. - What do you mean, "an order"?

738
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,300
1981年，你在纽约巴弗洛区抢劫货车
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

739
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,500
车上是原钢材料，这批材料原属于苏斯先生…
The cargo was raw steel, steel which belonged to Mr.Soze...

740
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,700
…本应送到巴基斯坦作核反应堆
...and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor.

741
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
那是违反联合国条例的大生意
A most profitable violation of UN Regulations.

742
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,200
你根本不知此事，基顿先生
You had no way of knowing this...

743
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,400
因为帮苏斯先生承运的人
...because the fellow shipping the steel was working for Soze...

744
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,100
也根本毫不知情
...without his knowledge.

745
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,100
今年初，范斯特先生与麦克麦纳斯先生…
Earlier this year, Mr.Fenster and Mr.McManus...

746
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,900
在纽华克机场抢劫了架双座货机
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.

747
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,300
机上载有黄金和白金
The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring also set for Pakistan.

748
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,400
两个月前，哈肯尼先生偷了…
Two months ago, Mr.Hockney stole a truck...

749
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,000
…途经皇后区的装载枪械零件的货车
...carrying gun parts through Queens.

750
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,700
而这些枪支零件本要由纽约州政府监督销毁
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of New York.

751
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,700
但在贝尔法斯特转机时就失踪了
They were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to Belfast.

752
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
同样地，苏斯先生利用不知情的人
Again, Mr.Soze using pawns who had no knowledge.

753
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,300
这样我们就找到了肯特先生
Which brings us to Mr.Kint.

754
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,000
九个月前，苏斯先生的…
Nine months ago, one of Mr.Soze's...

755
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,700
…一个不算聪明的手下
...less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam...

756
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,800
…被一个跛子所骗
...by a cripple.

757
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,500
他被骗去了六万二千元
He was relieved of $62,000.

758
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,200
花了很长时间，我们才找齐你们
Now, it has taken us some time to find you.

759
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,500
我们想你们在纽约落网后再找你们
Our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York.

760
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,000
是你安排的指认过程
You set up the lineup.

761
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,400
是的，我不来，你们是不会被释放的
Yes. You were not to be released until I had come to see you.

762
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,300
看来基顿先生的律师菲娜琳小姐
It seems Mr.Keaton's attorney, Miss Finneran...

763
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,200
…做事很有效率
...was a little too effective in expediting his release.

764
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,400
他比你们其他人出狱快多了
Holding the rest of you became a moot point.

765
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,400
- 那雷德福特呢？ - 雷德福特先生也一无所知
- What about Redfoot? - Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

766
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,200
苏斯先生很少长时间用同一批人工作
Mr.Soze rarely works with the same people for long...

767
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,100
而工作的人也不知道在为谁效劳 
...and they never know who they're working for.

768
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,100
如果没有手下，就不会被出卖
One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.

769
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
你为什么告诉我们？
So, why are you telling us?

770
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,700
因你们偷了苏斯先生的东西
Because you have stolen from Mr.Soze, Mr.Fenster.

771
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
你们所有人
All of you.

772
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,700
由于你们不知道偷的东西是他的，所以你们还活着
That you did not know it is the only reason you're still alive.

773
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,000
他觉得是你们欠了他，你们要还债给他
He feels you owe him. You will repay your debt.

774
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,300
去他妈的债，你去死吧，我们怎么知道你是为苏斯工作？
Fuck the debt, and fuck you. How do we know you work for Soze?

775
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,300
这有关系吗，哈肯尼先生？ 
I don't think that is very relevant.

776
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,700
你们五个与索尔·伯格…
All five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg...

777
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,100
…及其保镖的死有关
...and his bodyguards.

778
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,900
雷德福特先生可证明此事
Mr.Redfoot can testify to your involvement.

779
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,900
我们知道他会这么做的
We can see to it that he will.

780
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,100
- 你想说什么？ - 建议是这样的:
- What's your point? - The offer is this, gentlemen:

781
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,500
苏斯先生一直对毒品生意
Mr.Soze's primary interest...

782
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,300
…很有兴趣
...is narcotics.

783
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,700
他与阿根廷党竞争数年之久
He has been competing, shall we say...with a group of Argentineans for several years.

784
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,800
与苏斯先生对抗的人，已经尝到了教训
Competing with Mr.Soze has taken its toll.

785
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,200
他们三天前商谈好了一宗…
These Argentineans are negotiating the sale...

786
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,100
…九千一百万元的可卡因买卖
...of $91 million in cocaine in three days time.

787
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,100
不用说，这笔交易将重新复活他们的组织
Needless to say, this purchase will revitalize...the diminishing strength of their organization.

788
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,200
苏斯先生想让你们制止这次买卖
Mr.Soze would like you to stop the deal.

789
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,100
你们可等交易完成后才动手
If you choose, you may wait until after the buy.

790
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,800
他们交易的钱全属于你们
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

791
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:37,500
苏斯先生想你们在船上销毁那些可卡因
Mr.Soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

792
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,100
此后你们就与他两不相欠
And then you will be free of your obligations to Mr.Soze.

793
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,100
给个好理由，好让我现在不杀你
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.

794
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,600
这是苏斯先生给你们的礼物
A gift from Mr.Soze.

795
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,600
再见，先生们
Good day, gentlemen.

796
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,000
他们知道我以前的一切，我18岁后干过的一切 
They got my whole life in here, everything I've done since I was 18.

797
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,400
他们什么都知道
They fuckin' know everything.

798
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,300
甚至知道以前曾与我一同做牢的人
Everybody I've ever worked with or did time with.

799
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
不
No.

800
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,300
- 这事不对劲   - 我不知道
- This isn't right. - I don't know.

801
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,500
纽约常提及苏斯的人是谁？
Who's that guy who used to talk about Soze in New York?

802
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,300
- 是布里克·马林 - 他间接为他做事
- Bricks Marlin. - He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

803
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,700
他常说他所做的事有五倍利润
He said he always made five times more money on it than the job was worth.

804
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,000
那人是幻想狂
This guy's a pipe dream.

805
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,300
小林利用他作掩护
Kobayashi's using him for window dressing.

806
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,400
我不知道，这糟透了
I don't know. This is bad.

807
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,700
都是鬼扯，这人可能是纽约警察，这根本就是个圈套
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD. It's a fuckin' setup.

808
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,500
我听说的苏斯是个屠夫
The way I hear it, Soze's some kind of butcher.

809
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,100
- 是个变态无比的屠夫 - 根本没有凯撒·苏斯这人！
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher. - There is no Keyser Soze!

810
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,500
凯撒·苏斯是谁？
Who is Keyser Soze?

811
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,500
他应该是个土耳其人，有人说他父亲是德国人
He's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German.

812
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
人人都认为他是虚构的
Nobody ever believed he was real.

813
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,000
从来没有人亲眼见过他
Nobody knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him.

814
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
据小林说，任何人都可能为苏斯卖命
To hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze.

815
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,400
没人会知道，这就是他厉害之处
You never knew. That was his power.

816
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:36,500
最巧妙之处就是还能让人相信他不存在
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

817
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,600
那些家伙告诉我一个故事
One story the guys told me, the story I believe

818
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,400
我想那是他在土耳其时发生的事
...was from his days in Turkey.

819
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,400
有班匈牙利人想建立自己的组织
There was a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob.

820
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,900
他们知道想拥有权力…
They realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns...

821
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,500
…不用枪械，金钱， 甚至不需要手下
...or money or even numbers.

822
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,000
你只需做其他人不敢做的事
You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.

823
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,800
不久，他们努力做大，成为仅次于苏斯的另一大势力
After a while they come into power, and then they come after Soze.

824
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,200
他当时势力不大，只是经营毒品
He was small-time then. Just running dope, they say.

825
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,900
一天下午，他们到他家找他麻烦 
They come to his home...in the afternoon looking for his business.

826
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:12,200
但只在家里找到他妻儿，于是决定等苏斯回来
They find his wife and kids in the house, and decide to wait for Soze.

827
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,300
苏斯回家见妻子被奸，孩子们在哭喊
He comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming.

828
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,700
匈牙利人知道苏斯不好对付，都不敢惹他
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with.

829
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,500
他们告诉他只是想谈生意
They let him know they meant business.

830
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,200
不！
No!

831
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,500
他们说想要他的地盘，以及他所有业务
They tell him they want his territory, all his business.

832
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,400
苏斯看着家人的脸孔
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

833
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,800
他让这帮人见识了什么才是真正的意志 
Then he showed these men of will what will really was.

834
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,300
他说他情愿看着家人死去…
He tells them he would rather see his family dead...

835
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,000
总比屈辱求存好得多
...than live another day after this.

836
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,600
他放走最后那个匈牙利人…
He lets the last Hungarian go...

837
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,800
等安葬了妻儿后，然后找这班党徒逐一报复
...waits until his family is in the ground, and goes after the rest of the mob.

838
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,800
他杀了他们的孩子，杀了他们的妻子…
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

839
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,200
…杀了他们的父母及其朋友
...he kills their parents and their friends.

840
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,900
烧掉他们的居所…
He burns down the houses they live in...

841
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,800
…及他们工作的店
...and the stores they work in.

842
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,900
甚至还杀那些欠他们钱的人…
He kills people that owe them money. And like that...

843
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,000
…然后就消失了
...he's gone, underground.

844
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,700
自此再没人见过他， 他变成了一个神话
Nobody's ever seen him since. He becomes a myth.

845
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,900
一个罪犯们晚上给孩子说的故事
A spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.

846
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,100
“要是不听话， 凯撒·苏斯就会来抓你”
"Rat on your pop, and Keyser Soze will get you."

847
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
没有人相信这事
No one ever really believes.

848
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,300
你相信有这人吗？
Do you believe in him?

849
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,500
基顿总是说:
Keaton always said:

850
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,200
“我不信上帝，但我怕他”
"I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."

851
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,100
我信上帝
I believe in God.

852
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,500
唯一让我恐惧的就是凯撒·苏斯
And the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.

853
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,400
你对此有何看法？
You give any weight to this?

854
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,900
我会给你介绍法院的丹曼徹斯特
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice.

855
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,600
他有些关于苏斯在华盛顿的资料，收集那家伙的资料几乎成了他的业余爱好
He's got a file on Soze in DC. It's been a hobby of his for a while.

856
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,100
大多数人视他为『怪杰胡克』中的那个记者
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.

857
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,600
你听过他的事吗？
You've heard of him?

858
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,500
哪儿？在街上？
Where? On the street?

859
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,300
听过几次，都是无关痛痒的事
A few times. You know, outside stuff.

860
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,600
有些人间接为苏斯工作， 并赚了点钱 
Someone working for a guy who worked for a guy who got money from Soze.

861
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,300
就是那样
Shit like that.

862
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,400
就像是种古老的象征， 一种驱魔印
It could be an old badge. A hex sign.

863
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,500
这名字就是为了让人躲的远远的
Keep people from fucking with you when a name meant something.

864
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,500
- 但你已插手这事  - 没错
- But you're here. - Shit, yeah.

865
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,400
这家伙因为害怕苏斯，甚至想从医院里逃走
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital because he's so afraid of Soze.

866
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,800
我会提高警觉的
I'll run it up the flagpole.

867
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,700
我是清白的，我已经说了船上的事
I came clean. I told it like it happened.

868
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,300
再说去那儿的过程又有什么用 ？
So what about how I got there?

869
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,600
地方检察官也曾威胁我别指望特赦
It's so full of holes, the DA would've told me to forget amnesty.

870
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,900
你从我身上得到了想要的情报，已经赚了
You got what you wanted out of me. Big deal.

871
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,800
- 为何没把这些情况向地方检察官坦白？ - 那么你和我说…
- That's why you never told the DA? - You tell me.

872
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,200
如果我向你说是尼斯湖怪雇的我，你会怎么想？
If I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me, what would you say?

873
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,600
推翻证供，我们会召你作证
Turn state's evidence. We'll put you on the stand.

874
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,100
我已经获释了，你还能给我开什么条件？
I've got immunity. What can you possibly offer me?

875
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,800
若真有凯撒·苏斯其人，他会来找你的
If there really is a Keyser Soze, he's gonna come lookin' for you.

876
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,600
你有没有大脑？
Where's your head?

877
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,000
你以为事情就那么简单？
Where do you think the pressure is?

878
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,200
无论你称呼他凯撒·苏斯或是什么， 他都知道我身在何处
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him, knows where I am right now.

879
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,500
他能在十分钟里就把我找出来，然后逼你放人
He has the burner on your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

880
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
特赦也就是你们这些混蛋想出来的
Immunity was just a deal with you assholes.

881
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,800
若我被假释，我就有了新麻烦
I got a new problem when I post bail.

882
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,300
为何让他玩弄于股掌之间？ 我们能保护你
Why play into his hands? We can protect you.

883
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,700
多谢了，大卫，你说的太动听了
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion.

884
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,900
若要你吻我屁股，我也不反对的
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

885
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,300
把我赶至穷途末路的人，居然说要保护我？
The same fuckers that rounded us up are now bailing me out?

886
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,100
去你的
Fuck you.

887
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,400
你以为你能逮住凯撒·苏斯？
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

888
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,200
你以为像他这样的人会束手就擒吗
You think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?

889
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,100
若他真要出现，那就是为了除掉我
If he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me.

890
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,000
然后…
After that...

891
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,400
…我想你再也不会听到他的消息
...my guess is you'll never hear from him again.

892
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,100
后来怎样了？
What happened next?

893
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,000
我们第二天醒来，范斯特已经走了
We woke up the next morning and Fenster was gone.

894
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,600
他不想为苏斯卖命
He couldn't handle the idea of slumming for Soze.

895
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,800
他留下字条祝我们好运…
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

896
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,600
…还拿走了我们抢来的所有钱
...and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.

897
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,800
然后怎样？
Then what?

898
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,500
麦克麦纳斯很愤怒
McManus was furious.

899
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,800
说要把他捉回来剁碎他的心肝
He talked about tracking him down and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

900
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,700
那晚我们接到一个电话
That night, we got the call.

901
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,300
什么电话？
What call?

902
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,900
小林说已经找到了范斯特
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

903
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,400
我们快离开这儿
Let's get the fuck out of here.

904
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
我们得先把他埋了
We gotta bury him.

905
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,000
用什么挖坑？
With what?

906
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,000
用我们的手
With our hands.

907
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,300
神经病
This is nuts.

908
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
这里全是干沙
It's dry fucking sand.

909
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,100
等他尸身腐烂时，一里外的冲浪者也能闻到尸臭
When he rots the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away.

910
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
- 给我挖 - 我们该怎么办？
- Dig, you fuck. - What are we gonna do?

911
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,200
这家伙想把我们全干了
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

912
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,100
我不知道你的打算，跛子，但我要跑路，我没什么问题
I don't know about you, peg leg, but I can run. I got no problem with that.

913
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,200
小林要干掉你也没什么问题
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.

914
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,900
你就走吧， 我们会为你挖另一个坑
You run, and we're gonna be diggin' a hole for you.

915
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,500
明白吗？
You got that?

916
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:06,500
死的又不是我亲儿子，我不欠任何人的！
This ain't my boy we're burying. I don't owe anybody!

917
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,000
- 去你的吧   - 我们在一起混了五年
- So fuck you. - He was my partner for five years.

918
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,700
所见过的钱比你想象的还多
We did more jobs and I saw more money than you can ever count.

919
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,200
你给我去死！
So fuck you!

920
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,900
- 所以现在才要还债！ - 这不是还债！
- 'Cause now it's payback! - It's not payback!

921
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,200
这只是警告
It's precaution.

922
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,600
想还债那就去还，想跑路的就跑吧，我不在乎
You want payback? You wanna run? I don't care.

923
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,800
我不是为范斯特这么做
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

924
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,500
也不是为你们这么做
I'm not doin' it for you.

925
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,900
我只是为了我自己而已
I'm doin' this for me.

926
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,600
我得把事情全了结
I'm gonna finish this thing.

927
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,500
我不会让这叫小林的杂碎活下去
This Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me.

928
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,800
范斯特被杀后，没有人逃跑？
After they killed Fenster, nobody would run?

929
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,900
- 我想的，我知道我们定能逃脱   - 那你为什么不说什么？
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it. - Why didn't you say anything?

930
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,600
相信我，我试了，但基顿不同意这么做
Believe me, I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.

931
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,700
我们很难劝服他
It was too far-fetched for him.

932
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,000
基顿很固执，他曾是警察
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

933
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,000
警察是不会接受复杂的解释的
To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated.

934
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,700
总是容易受骗
It's always simple.

935
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,400
不信街上的流言，不信幕后有黑手
There's no mystery to the street, no arch-criminal.

936
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,200
如果你发现一具死尸，并认定这是他兄弟干的，你很可能是对的
You got a body and think his brother did it, you're probably right.

937
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,800
没人与基顿争论
Nobody argued with Keaton.

938
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,500
人人都准备好好的教训小林
They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

939
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,800
他们上来了
They're coming up.

940
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,700
- 收到了吗？他上来了   - 他正下来
- Did you hear me? He's coming up. - He's on his way down.

941
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,800
别动
Don't move.

942
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,200
按二十楼，快
Press 20. Do it now.

943
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,600
出去
Move.

944
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,900
- 我们的答复是“不行”   - 苏斯先生会很--
- The answer is "no." - Mr.Soze will be most--

945
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,200
听着，混蛋，根本没有凯撒·苏斯这个人
Listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser Soze.

946
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,800
要再提这名字，我就立马杀了你
Mention his name again, I'll kill you right now.

947
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,700
真是奇怪， 我以为你们是为了杀我而来
A strange threat. I assume you've come here to kill me anyway.

948
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,600
我知道你找的到我们…
We know that you can get to us...

949
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,300
…可现在你也知道了，我们能找到你
...but now you know that we can get to you.

950
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,900
我最后给你次机会去终止此事
I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.

951
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
我的雇主已经决定了
My employer has made up his mind.

952
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,600
- 他不会改变主意的   - 我们也不会
- He does not change it. - Neither do we.

953
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,600
你能杀范斯特，但你杀不了我们所有人
You got Fenster, but you won't be able to get all of us.

954
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,000
至少在我们中的某个干掉你之前不会
Not before one of us gets through to you.

955
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,200
我信你的话，是真的相信
I believe you. I most sincerely do.

956
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,800
若你们不是有能耐的人，就不会被选进来
You would not have been chosen were you not so suitable.

957
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,800
但我不能做这决定，无论你怎样…
But I cannot make this decision. Whatever you threaten me with is...

958
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,700
…恐吓我都会于事无补
...ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me...

959
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,400
…因我必须完全执行命令
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

960
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,400
想杀你的人就是我
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

961
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,300
我只想你知道那点
I just wanted you to know that.

962
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

963
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,200
就当是我在恳求，请相信我
I implore you, believe me...

964
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
…苏斯先生确有其人
...Mr.Soze is very real...

965
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,500
- …而他是个很坚决的人   - 我们等着瞧吧
- ...and very determined. - We'll see.

966
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,300
在你干掉我之前…
Before you do me in...

967
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,700
…请允许我先去了结与菲娜琳小姐的公事好吗？
...you will let me finish my business with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

968
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,200
你说什么？
What did you say?

969
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,900
伊迪·菲娜琳
Edie Finneran.

970
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,200
她正在楼上我的办公室…
She's upstairs in my office...

971
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,000
…等着交涉一桩引渡案
...for an extradition deposition.

972
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,800
她要求我亲自与她谈这案子
I requested she be put on the case personally.

973
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,700
她是昨天飞来洛杉矶的
She flew in yesterday.

974
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,000
没关系
No matter.

975
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,400
动手吧
Kill away.

976
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,700
你在说谎
You're lying.

977
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,300
有吗？
Am I?

978
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,400
菲娜琳小姐在洛杉矶期间，将受到很好的保护
Miss Finneran's escort while she's here in Los Angeles.

979
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,100
保镖会片刻不离其左右
Never leaves her for a moment.

980
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,000
我想你也会高兴，她的安全受到保障
I thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands.

981
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,600
好好休息去吧，船会在星期五到
Get some rest. The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

982
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,300
若你或你的朋友，有任何轻举妄动
If I see you or any of your friends before then...

983
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,200
…菲娜琳小姐将会饱受折磨而死
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies.

984
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,800
哈肯尼先生，你的父亲…
As indeed will your father, Mr.Hockney...

985
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,200
…还有肯特先生在亚里桑那州的叔叔也会如此
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr.Kint.

986
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,600
我还会亲手阉掉麦克麦纳斯先生的侄子
I might only castrate Mr.McManus' nephew, David.

987
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,500
你们都清楚了吗？
Do I make myself clear?

988
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,400
我们会处理楼下那两具尸体
We will take care of the two bodies downstairs.

989
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,700
并会把那账算到范斯特先生身上
We'll add them to the cost of Mr.Fenster.

990
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,800
请恕失陪，各位
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

991
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,100
这真是场怪异的恶梦
It's a logistical nightmare.

992
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,000
约有十到二十人
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

993
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,600
我们估计不到船舱内还有多少人
There's no tellin' how many more are gonna be below deck.

994
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,900
要偷袭那些家伙吗？
Can we stealth these guys?

995
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,500
因为是毒品交易，他们会小心防范的
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

996
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,700
而且会带给我们另一个问题
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

997
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,900
即使我们偷袭成功并劫走那船，还是会一无所得
Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

998
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,700
等他们收了钱又如何？
What if we wait for the money?

999
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,000
那至少要再多干掉十个人
Ten more men at least.

1000
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,600
以我看来，这行不通
In my opinion, it can't be done.

1001
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,200
谁进去了都不会活着出来
Anyone who goes in is not comin' out alive.

1002
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,300
- 我会等钱到再下手   - 我也是
- I'm gonna wait for the money. - Me, too.

1003
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,800
- 你们有听他在说吗？    - 既然进去了，就没指望全身而退
- Did you hear what he just said? - If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

1004
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,100
我也是
Me, too.

1005
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,600
天下没有办不成的事
There's nothing that can't be done.

1006
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,400
真不敢相信我们就这样直接去送死 
I just can't believe we're gonna walk in to certain death.

1007
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,200
电台里说纽约正在下雨
The news said it's raining in New York.

1008
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,500
他们说的那是什么话？
What language is that?

1009
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,900
不知道，可能是俄语
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1010
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,100
好象是匈牙利语
Hungarian?

1011
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,800
各位，包裹已经送到了
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1012
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,900
你们准备好了吗？
You kids ready?

1013
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,500
若不是停下来答你，就已经预备好了
I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.

1014
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,900
我已经准备妥当
I'm ready.

1015
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,000
麦克麦纳斯，你要在十秒内搞定
McManus, you better be set up in 10 seconds.

1016
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,100
准备好了
I'm ready.

1017
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,200
我要你留在这里
I want you to stay here.

1018
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,900
我本来要掩护--
I'm supposed to cover--

1019
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,800
如果我们出不来了， 带上钱赶快走
If we don't get out of this, take the money and go.

1020
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,000
我不能--
I can't--

1021
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,400
去找伊迪，告诉她全部真相
Find Edie. Tell her everything that happened.

1022
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
她认识许多人，她知道该如何处理
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1023
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,600
如果用我的方法除不掉小林， 那么她有别的办法
If I don't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.

1024
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,200
- 可要是我--   - 按我说的去做
- What if I-- - Just do what I say.

1025
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,100
拜托了
Please.

1026
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,000
告诉她….
Tell her that...

1027
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,200
告诉她我已经尽力了
Tell her I tried.

1028
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,900
麦克麦纳斯，他过来了
McManus, he's on his way.

1029
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,600
我已经就位
I'm there.

1030
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,600
一，二，三，四…
One, two, three, four...

1031
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,800
…五，六，七…
...five, six, seven...

1032
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,900
奥斯瓦德的活不好干啊
Oswald was a fag.

1033
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,400
你好
Hi.

1034
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,600
你好吗？
How you doin'?

1035
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,800
有什么问题吗？
Is there a problem?

1036
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,300
快
Now.

1037
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,800
王二先生有块地
"Old McDonald had a farm

1038
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,400
咿呀咿呀呦
"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O

1039
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,300
“在那地里他杀了班人”
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

1040
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,500
明星要出场了
Elvis has left the building.

1041
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,400
别开枪，别开枪，自己人
Hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!

1042
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,300
好啊
Hello.

1043
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,000
你为何不逃？
Why didn't you run?

1044
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,200
我被吓呆了
I froze up.

1045
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,300
我想起了范斯特被埋葬时的样子
I thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him.

1046
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,500
然后我又想到基顿，那时候看起来他离成功不远
Then I thought about Keaton, and it looked like he might pull it off.

1047
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,900
有个男孩在沙滩上发现一具尸体
A boy found a body on the beach today.

1048
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,400
是被人从船上抛下海的，头部中了两枪
Thrown clear of the boat. Shot twice in the head.

1049
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,400
事物局的两个人去鉴定了他的身份
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

1050
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,600
- 然后呢？   - 他叫阿尔图罗·马奎斯
- What else? - His name was Arturo Marquez.

1051
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,600
是个阿根廷走私犯
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1052
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,500
去年在纽约曾因走私而被捕
He was arrested last year in New York for trafficking.

1053
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,400
他逃往加州，但在长岛被捉回
He escapes to California. They pick him up in Long Beach.

1054
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,800
他们安排引渡他回国，但又被他逃脱
They're setting up extradition, he escapes again.

1055
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,200
看看这个
Now, get this.

1056
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,900
伊迪·菲娜琳提出的引渡建议
Edie Finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings.

1057
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,300
小林
Kobayashi

1058
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,500
纽约传给了我一份马奎斯证供的复印件
New York faxed me a copy of his testimony.

1059
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,200
- 他是个告密者   - 是个大叛徒
- He was a rat. - A big fucking rat.

1060
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,000
阿尔图罗很害怕回到监狱
Arturo was very opposed to returning to prison.

1061
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,000
甚至于他供出了将近五十个人
So much so, that he named close to 50 people.

1062
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,500
猜猜最后的人名是谁？
Guess who he named in the finale.

1063
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,900
凯撒·苏斯
Keyser Soze

1064
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,600
还有
There's more.

1065
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,300
我会把所知一切告诉你，若说重覆了就告诉我
I'll tell you what I know. Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1066
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,900
船上根本就没有毒品
There was no dope on that boat.

1067
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,100
待着别出声音
You, stay quiet.

1068
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,600
他来了
He's here.

1069
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,000
我知道他来了，就是他，我告诉你，就是他
I know he's here. That's him. I'm telling you, that's him.

1070
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,800
我知道他来了！
I know he's here!

1071
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,500
- 你不明白，是他   - 安静
- You can't understand. That's him. - Shut up.

1072
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,000
就是他，你听到没？ 我告诉你，是凯撒·苏斯来了！
That's him. You hear me? I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1073
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,200
- 哈肯尼在哪里？   - 我不知道
- Where's Hockney? - I don't know.

1074
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,900
这儿没毒品
There's no coke.

1075
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,000
- 什么？   - 你听得很清楚，该死的
- What? - You heard me, dumb fuck.

1076
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,400
- 根本就没有毒品！   - 你到底什么意思？没有毒品？
- There's no coke! - What the fuck? No coke?

1077
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,100
我已经仔细搜过了每间房
I've been up and down in every fucking room.

1078
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,400
- 一定有的！   - 根本没有！
- There's gotta be coke! - There is nothing!

1079
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,700
没有！
Nothing!

1080
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,700
别跟我开玩笑了
Don't you fuck with me.

1081
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,700
根本就没有毒品！
There is no fucking coke!

1082
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,400
我要走了
I'm out of here.

1083
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,100
我什么都没对他们说
I told them nothing.

1084
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,400
我发誓我没有
I swear.

1085
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,700
我什么也没说，求你了
I told them nothing. Please.

1086
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,900
究竟是怎么回事？
What the fuck is goin' on?

1087
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,400
这是真是太怪了
The strangest thing.

1088
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,300
那就是你供词中所提到过的，那个穿西服的瘦男人？
That's what you said. You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1089
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,900
等等
Wait a minute.

1090
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
你说你看见了凯撒·苏斯？
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1091
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:16,600
- 先前的证供里你说不知道那男人是谁   - 我知道船上肯定有毒品
- You said you didn't know who it was. - I know there was dope on that boat.

1092
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,200
- 别再拖延时间   - 我没有
- Stop stallin'. - I'm not.

1093
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,900
- 你明白我想知道什么   - 给我走开
- You know what I'm getting at. - Get out of my face.

1094
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,800
我已经被豁免了，不需要再受你恐吓
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.

1095
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,600
你明白我想知道什么
You know what I'm getting at.

1096
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,200
- 我不知道你在说什么   - 说出真相！
- I don't know what you're talking about. - The truth!

1097
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,400
告诉我是谁杀了基顿
Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.

1098
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,500
我说了
I did.

1099
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,000
你在撒谎
You're lying to me.

1100
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:36,500
- 你知道事实真相   - 我不知道你在说什么
- You've known this whole time. - I don't know what you're saying.

1101
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,200
我看见基顿中了枪，我发誓
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.

1102
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,900
你为何不救他？你手上有枪
Why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1103
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,900
他可是你的朋友
He was your friend.

1104
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,600
因为我害怕
Because I was afraid.

1105
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,400
- 怕极了   - 你怕什么？
- Afraid. - Afraid of what?

1106
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,700
- 怕什么--   - 我知道那是凯撒·苏斯
- Afraid of-- - I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1107
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,900
是凯撒·苏斯，他是魔鬼的化身
It was Keyser Soze, I mean, the Devil himself.

1108
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,800
你怎么敢在魔鬼的背后开枪？
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1109
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,000
要是射不中又如何？
What if you miss?

1110
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,600
那说回码头的事
Let's get back to the pier.

1111
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,800
- 听说过阿尔图罗·马奎斯吗？   - 谁？没有
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him? - What? No.

1112
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,600
他是司法部的线人
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department.

1113
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:51,000
他向联邦执行官录了份口供
He swore out a statement to federal marshals...

1114
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:54,500
…说他见过并能认出…
...saying that he had seen and could positively identify one...

1115
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,800
凯撒·苏斯
...Keyser Soze

1116
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,100
这报告中还记载着
It says right here in the report.

1117
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,900
他熟知凯撒·苏斯一切业务…
He had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including...

1118
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,200
包括运毒及谋杀以外的事情
...but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.

1119
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,800
我从未听说过他
I never heard of him.

1120
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,700
他的手下把他出卖给匈牙利党
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians.

1121
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,400
这班匈牙利人似乎被苏斯清除并赶回土耳其
Most likely the same Hungarians that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1122
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,400
那钱并不是用来买毒品的
The money wasn't there for dope.

1123
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,800
这班匈牙利人会收买…
The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy...

1124
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,000
一个能把凯撒·苏斯治罪的人
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1125
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,900
- 我说了我从未听过他   - 但基顿听过
- I said I never heard of him. - But Keaton did.

1126
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
伊迪·菲娜琳是马奎斯引渡案的顾问
Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition advisor.

1127
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,300
她知道他是谁，还知道他掌握的资料
She knew who he was and what he knew.

1128
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,800
船上根本没有毒品，这只是次谋杀行动
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit.

1129
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,500
这次自杀式的行动
A suicide mission to whack out the one guy...

1130
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,700
…目的是去干掉这个能指证凯撒·苏斯的家伙
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1131
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,900
于是苏斯派了班贼去执行
So Soze put some thieves to it...

1132
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,700
他算好了这班人一定会死
...men he knew he could march into certain death.

1133
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,500
你说苏斯利用我们去杀人？
You're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?

1134
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,800
我说就是基顿本人，他把你留在后面是有原因的
I'm saying Keaton did. He left you behind for a reason.

1135
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,400
按我说的去做
Just do what I tell you.

1136
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,700
既然无论跑到何处，苏斯都能找到你…
If you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere...

1137
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,700
…为何还给你金钱逃亡？
...why did he give you the money to run?

1138
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,100
- 他可以在船上就把你干掉   - 他不想我死
- He could have used you on the boat. - He wanted me to live.

1139
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,400
一个过去的贪污警察
A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world...

1140
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,800
…竟然有颗挽救跛子贼的善心？
...finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple?

1141
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,300
这不可能，先生，你能给我理由吗？
No, sir. Why?

1142
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,100
是因为伊迪
Edie.

1143
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,800
我从头到尾就不信这个改过自新的故事
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.

1144
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,200
就算我信这点…
Even if I did...

1145
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,900
…我也不会相信他会派你去保护她
...I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her.

1146
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,400
给我个解释？
So why?

1147
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,700
因为我们是朋友
Because he was my friend.

1148
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,700
不，他不是你的朋友，基顿没有任何朋友
No, he wasn't your friend. Keaton didn't have friends.

1149
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,200
你来这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

1150
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:31,000
他留下你的命，是因为他用的到你
He saved you because he wanted it that way.

1151
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,200
这就是他的目的
It was his will.

1152
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,500
- 基顿就是凯撒·苏斯   - 不是
- Keaton was Keyser Soze. - No.

1153
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:39,100
只有他才能干掉哈肯尼和麦克麦纳斯这类角色
A man who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus.

1154
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:44,500
只有他才能轻松的在警局里安排指认
A man who could engineer a police lineup...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1155
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,100
只有他才会残忍的杀害伊迪·菲娜琳
The kind of man who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1156
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,000
她的尸体昨天在宾夕法尼亚州一间酒店被发现
She was found yesterday at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

1157
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,900
…头部连中两枪而亡
...shot twice in the head.

1158
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,700
现在你对基顿有何看法？
What do you think about Keaton now?

1159
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
伊迪死了？
Edie?

1160
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,300
他利用你们掩护他上船
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1161
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,700
这事他本来一个人做不了，他必须要亲自下手…
He couldn't get on alone. He had to pull the trigger himself...

1162
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,700
…以确认干掉了那个…
...to make sure he got his man...

1163
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,900
…能指认他的家伙
...the one man that could identify him.

1164
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,600
全是胡说
This is all bullshit.

1165
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,800
你说亲眼看见他死了
You said you saw him die.

1166
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,200
肯定吗？
Or did you?

1167
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,800
听到警车来到时，你想藏起来
You had to hide when you heard the police cars.

1168
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,300
你说在起火前听到枪声…
You said you heard the shot before the fire...

1169
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,700
…可你没看见他死
...but you didn't see him die.

1170
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,800
- 我了解他，他绝不会--   - 他是在利用你
- I knew him. He would never-- - He programmed you.

1171
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,500
他安排由你来说整个骗局
He programmed you to tell us what he wanted you to.

1172
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,800
就如你说的，他知道我们问不出什么来
He knew we were close. You said it yourself.

1173
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,900
保你出去的政治压力由何而来？
Where was the political pressure to protect you from?

1174
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,200
就是基顿在幕后
It was Keaton.

1175
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,600
- 被豁免就是给你的奖赏    - 但为什么偏偏是我？
- Immunity was your reward. - But why me?

1176
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,300
为什么不挑范斯特，或是麦克麦纳斯和哈肯尼？
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1177
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,100
为什么是我？ 我又蠢又跛，为什么是我？
Why me? I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?

1178
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,600
就因为你是个跛子
Because you're a cripple.

1179
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,800
就因为你很愚蠢
Because you're stupid.

1180
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,000
就因为你比他们没用
Because you're weaker than them.

1181
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,600
要是他死了….
If he's dead...

1182
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:10,000
要是你说的是真的，那么就没问题了
If what you say is true, then it won't matter.

1183
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,400
袭击警车是不是他的主意？
It was his idea to hit the taxi service, wasn't it?

1184
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,600
- 对我说实话    - 是基顿提出的
- Come on, tell me the truth. - It was all Keaton.

1185
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:21,500
我们一直跟着他
We followed him from the beginning.

1186
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,400
我不知道
I didn't know.

1187
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,600
我看到他死了
I saw him die.

1188
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:30,500
我也相信他已经死了
I believe he's dead. Christ.

1189
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,500
你单独一人会不安全
You're not safe on your own.

1190
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,800
你认为他是….
You think he's...

1191
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,700
凯撒·苏斯
Keyser Soze?

1192
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,200
我不知道
I don't know.

1193
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:48,600
凯撒·苏斯只是个化名， 或就如你说的，是个传说
Keyser Soze's a shield, or like you said, a spook story.

1194
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:53,300
但我很了解基顿，你一出去就有人等着干掉你
But I know Keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you.

1195
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:57,500
- 别出去，让我们保护你    - 我才不当诱饵，我已经自由了
- Stay here and let us protect you. - I'm not bait. I post today.

1196
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,200
二十分钟前你就可以走了
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1197
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,900
里欧队长想你尽快离开这里
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

1198
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,100
- 除非你想翻供   - 我会把握机会的，谢了
- Unless you turn state's. - I'll take my chances.

1199
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,100
如果有人想要干掉你，那他们一定要选在外面下手
If someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there.

1200
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,600
若你改变口供，就再也不用害怕
Turn state's evidence. You might never see trial.

1201
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,900
也许如此
Maybe so.

1202
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,400
可我不是叛徒
But I'm not a rat.

1203
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,700
该死的警察
Fuckin' cops.

1204
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,800
能借用你的传真机吗？
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1205
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,400
请在这儿签个名，肯特先生
You'll have to sign for these, Mr.Kint.

1206
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,200
一块金表
One watch, gold.

1207
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,800
金打火机
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1208
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,600
一包烟，谢谢
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1209
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:21,300
我们仍是一无所知
We still got nothing.

1210
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,900
我知道了关于基顿的事
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

1211
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,600
那毫无价值
Which is nothing.

1212
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,600
没关系，他很快会知道我们了解了多少
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.

1213
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,700
不管凯撒·苏斯存不存在
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1214
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:36,000
…只要基顿还活着，他就不会再出现了
...if Keaton is alive, he's not comin' up again.

1215
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,300
我会去找他
I'll find him.

1216
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:40,200
那是浪费时间
Waste of time.

1217
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,400
若是传闻不会平息， 那就不算是传闻了
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1218
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,000
什么？
What?

1219
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,100
没什么
Nothing.

1220
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,900
伙计，你这儿真够乱的
Man, you're a slob.

1221
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,300
但东西摆放的都还有规律
But it all has a system.

1222
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:00,600
要是全摆的整整齐齐的，就没有亲和力了
It all makes sense if you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.

1223
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:05,000
要看更恐怖的地方吗？到我车库去就知道了
You wanna see a real horror show? See my garage.

1224
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,400
说服我，告诉我每个细节
Convince me. Tell me every last...

1225
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:47,500
我曾经加入过在伊利诺州斯科基的一个男声四重唱组合…
When I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

1226
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,100
- 你到底有没有大脑？   - 我们需要先思考周全，再想想
- Where's your head? - We need to think, think back.

1227
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,800
我肯定你们已听过不少传言
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.

1228
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,500
- 是布里克·马林   - 这事不对劲
- Bricks Marlin. - This isn't right.

1229
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,000
- 我想听听你的故事   - 已经全说了
- I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.

1230
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:00,500
- 我说的都是实话   - 来自加州的，名叫雷德福特
- I'm tellin' it straight. - Some guy in California called Redfoot.

1231
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,100
- 这是苏斯先生送上的礼物   - 老实对我说
- A gift from Mr.Soze. - Talk to me.

1232
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,200
- 那雷德福特呢？   - 雷德福特先生并不知情汇报
- What about Redfoot? - Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

1233
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,300
- 利用不知情的人…   - 是个超级大胖子
- Using pawns... - A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.

1234
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,100
还有个律师…
There was a lawyer...

1235
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,800
叫小林
Kobayashi...

1236
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:16,400
我曾在危地马拉尝过咖啡豆磨的新鲜咖啡
When I was picking beans in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.

1237
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,500
- 我知道你认为他是好人 - 我知道他很好
- I know you thought he was a good man. - I know he was good.

1238
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,800
- 告诉我全部的细节 - 这事怪极了
- You tell me every last detail. - The strangest thing.

1239
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,800
你怎么敢在魔鬼的背后开枪？
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1240
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,100
这家伙的后台很硬
This guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of...

1241
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,500
说说你的故事，拐脚佬
What's your story, pretzel man?

1242
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,400
- 还有个律师    - 什么律师？
- There was a lawyer. - What lawyer?

1243
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,600
我就是小林
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

1244
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:39,200
- 小林，小林，   - 告诉我所有的细节
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi. - Tell me every last detail.

1245
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:42,500
- 我为凯撒·苏斯做事，   - 说服我，说服我
- I work for Keyser Soze. - Convince me. Convince me.

1246
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,400
所有犯罪的大小角色
Every creep and scumbag that works the street...

1247
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,600
…都会知道维伯·肯特的大名
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1248
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,700
你见过那跛子吗？
The cripple, did you see him?

1249
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,900
- 那跛子！他朝那里走了？ - 他往那边去了
- The cripple! Which way did he go? - He went out that way.

1250
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,600
我知道你知情，我还知道你没说实话…
I know you know something. I know you're not telling...

1251
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:11,800
我比你聪明
I'm smarter than you...

1252
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,400
…不管你是否愿意，我都会找到我要的答案
...and I'm gonna find out whether you like it or not.

1253
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,400
警察是不会接受复杂的解释的
To a cop, the explanation is never complicated.

1254
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,000
- 总是那么容易受骗   - 真相
- It's always simple. - The truth!

1255
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:21,000
根本就没什么幕后主使
There's no arch-criminal behind it all.

1256
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,900
那个人有这能力，能够掌握…
Somebody with power, somebody who is capable...

1257
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,700
凯撒·苏斯
Keyser Soze!

1258
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:31,900
你以为像他这样的人会束手就擒吗？
You think a guy like that gets this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?

1259
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,800
就是因为你愚蠢，就因为你是跛子
Because you're stupid. Because you're a cripple.

1260
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:38,000
现在我想知道那跛子是谁？
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?

1261
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,500
你完全知道事实真相
You've known the whole fuckin' time.

1262
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,200
要是他来也是要找我， 我肯定基顿已经死了
If he comes up for anything it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.

1263
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,200
我的双腿没有知觉，凯撒
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1264
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,800
干这行我学会的第一件事知道是什么吗？
First thing I learned on the job. You know what?

1265
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:53,400
- 就是如何辨认凶手   - 你见到那个跛子了吗？
- How to spot a murderer. - You got the cripple in there?

1266
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,200
- 他有提到凯撒·苏斯吗？   - 谁？
- Did he mention Keyser Soze? - Who?

1267
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:58,000
那之后…
After that...

1268
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:01,500
…我猜之后再听不到他的消息
...my guess is you'll never hear from him again.

1269
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,219
最巧妙之处就是能让人相信他不存在
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1270
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:30,300
然后就象那样…
And like that...

1271
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,400
…消失的无影无踪
...he's gone

1272
