1
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,330
How you doing   Keaton?

2
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,380
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,920
...Keyser.

4
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,340
Ready?

5
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,320
What time is it?

6
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,940
12:30.

7
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,220
It all started back in New York six weeks ago.

8
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,930
A truck loaded with gun parts got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,430
The driver saw nobody   but someone fucked up.

10
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,350
He heard a voice. Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,940
Mr. McManus?

12
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,190
Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

13
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,660
- We have a warrant for your arrest. - Fuck you   pig.

14
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,790
Todd Hockney?

15
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,340
- Who wants to know? - New York Police Department.

16
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Shit!

17
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,050
- Freeze! - Hold it!

18
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,140
You sure you brought enough guys?

19
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,890
It's quite simple.

20
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,890
A restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the esthetic.

21
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,650
In other words   the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls.

22
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,480
Let me give you an example.

23
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,650
This I had to see for myself.

24
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,240
David.

25
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,740
- I'm in a meeting. - Time for another one.

26
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,290
Everyone   this is David Kujan.

27
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,420
Special Agent Kujan   U.S. Customs.

28
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,540
These men are from the New York Police Department.

29
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,090
You look good   Keaton. Better than I'd have thought.

30
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,590
You have a problem?

31
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,510
A small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns.

32
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,270
Mr. Keaton?

33
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,770
Will you excuse us for a moment?

34
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,610
We have some questions to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

35
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,650
No   no   no   please. Please   sit down.

36
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,030
This is a small problem.

37
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,410
Enjoy the meal.

38
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,240
Talk to you later.

39
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,770
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

40
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,770
These guys were hard-core hijackers.

41
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
But there I was.

42
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,230
At that point   I wasn't scared.

43
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,570
I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for.

44
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,200
Besides   it was fun.

45
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,990
I got to make like I was notorious.

46
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,330
You all know the drill.

47
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,330
When your number is called   repeat the phrase you've been given.

48
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,000
Number one   step forward.

49
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,300
Hand me the keys   you fucking cocksucker.

50
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,470
Number two   step forward.

51
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,440
Give me the fucking keys   you cocksucker   motherfucker...

52
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,360
Knock it off. Get back. Number three   step forward.

53
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,620
- Hand me the keys   you cocksucker. - In English   please.

54
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,080
Excuse me?

55
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,330
In English.

56
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,460
Hand me the keys   you cocksucker. What the fuck?

57
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,590
Number four   step forward.

58
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,670
It was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup.

59
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,010
Hand me the keys   you fucking cocksucker.

60
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,680
It was the cops' fault.

61
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,850
You don't put guys like that into a room together.

62
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,100
Who knows what can happen.

63
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,270
Hand me the keys   you fucking cocksucker.

64
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,650
This has really gotta be embarrassing for you guys.

65
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,450
Someone was pissed about that hijacked truck. The cops had nothing.

66
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,740
They hoped somebody would slip and give them something.

67
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,910
They knew we wouldn't fight it because they knew how to lean on us.

68
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,870
Our rights went out the window. It was a violation. Disgraceful.

69
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,710
They went after McManus first. Topnotch entry man.

70
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,460
What truck?

71
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,260
- The truck with the guns   fucko. - Fucko?

72
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,430
He was a good guy. Crazy though.

73
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,430
Wanna know what Fenster told us?

74
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,100
- Said who? - McManus. He told us another story.

75
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,860
Was that the one about the hooker with the dysentery?

76
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,940
Fenster worked with McManus. He was a tight-ass.

77
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,490
But when it came to the job   he was right on. A smart man.

78
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,860
What are you saying?

79
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,280
- I said he'll flip you. - He'll what?

80
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,200
- Flip you for real. - I'm shaking.

81
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,500
Come on. Answer my question.

82
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,330
Can you hear me in the back?

83
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,170
I want my lawyer.

84
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,170
I'm gonna have your fucking badge   cocksucker.

85
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,220
Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.

86
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,970
Without a doubt   the guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

87
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,430
You guys don't have a leg to stand on.

88
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,390
I can put you in Queens on the night of the hijacking.

89
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,850
Really?

90
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,940
I live in Queens. Did you put that together yourself   Einstein?

91
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,440
You got a team of monkeys working on this?

92
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,860
You know what happens if you do another turn in the joint?

93
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,040
Fuck your father and then have a snack.

94
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,620
- You gonna charge me? - I'll charge you when I'm ready.

95
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,330
- With what? - You know damn well   dead man.

96
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,250
But Keaton? He was the real prize for them   for obvious reasons.

97
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,920
It was your mistake. Not mine.

98
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,180
Did you ever stop to ask me?

99
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,810
I mean   I been walking around with the same face   the same name.

100
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,140
I'm a businessman.

101
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
What's that? The restaurant business?

102
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,360
From now on   you're in the getting-fucked-by-us business.

103
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,990
I'm gonna make you famous   cocksucker.

104
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,950
Like I said...

105
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,370
...it was your mistake. Not mine.

106
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,040
Now   you charge me with this shit...

107
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,330
...and I'll beat it.

108
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,800
Let's get back to the truck   asshole.

109
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,260
Somebody's gotta do something. I get hauled in every five minutes.

110
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,600
So I did a little time. Does that mean I get railed...

111
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,350
...every time a truck finds its way off the planet? Fuck them.

112
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,690
Fenster   will you relax? These guys don't have any probable cause.

113
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,030
You're fucking-A right. No P.C.

114
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,400
You're goddamn right. You do some time   never let you go.

115
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,570
They treat me like a criminal   I'll end up a criminal.

116
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,240
You are a criminal.

117
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,580
Now   why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.

118
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,460
Why don't you make your point? You're making me tired all over.

119
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,880
Fuck it   then.

120
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,260
- I heard you were dead. - Oh   yeah?

121
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,760
- You heard right. - Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

122
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,890
- What's that all about? - What's this?

123
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,390
Rumor is Keaton's gone straight.

124
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,310
- I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran. - Who's that?

125
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,650
A heavyweight criminal lawyer. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

126
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,980
How about it   Keaton?

127
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,070
You a lawyer's wife?

128
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,570
What retainer you giving her?

129
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,790
Hey   Fenster   do your friend a favor.

130
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,580
Tell him to keep quiet.

131
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,420
Dean Keaton.

132
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,960
Gone clean   huh?

133
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,260
Say it ain't so.

134
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,130
Or did you hit that truck?

135
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,050
Mac   Mac. Forget him. Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

136
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,010
This whole thing was a shakedown.

137
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,730
- Why do you say that? - How many times you been in a lineup?

138
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,850
It's always you and four dummies.

139
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,360
P.D. pays homeless guys 10 bucks a head half the time.

140
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,860
There's no way they'd line five felons in the same row.

141
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,530
A voice lineup? A public defender could get you out of that.

142
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,530
So why was I strip-searched?

143
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,410
It was the feds.

144
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,750
A truckload of guns get snagged.

145
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,870
Customs comes down on NYPD for answers. They come up with us.

146
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,250
- They're clutching at straws. - A guy's finger was up my ass.

147
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,670
Is it Friday already?

148
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,010
Yeah   lover-boy.

149
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,970
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

150
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,720
So who are the goddamn pigs who stole our fucking truck?

151
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,020
- What did you say? - Who stole the fucking truck?

152
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,230
- I don't want to know. - Who asked you   working man?

153
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,770
Fuck who did it. I wanna know   who's the gimp?

154
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,820
- He's okay. - Says you. What about it   pretzel man?

155
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,910
His name is Verbal.

156
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,490
Verbal Kint.

157
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,830
Roger   really. People say I talk too much.

158
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,870
I was gonna tell you to shut up.

159
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,880
We met before once or twice.

160
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,500
In county. I was in for fraud.

161
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,920
You were in a lineup. What happened?

162
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,970
I walked. 90 days suspended.

163
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,380
So you did it.

164
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,470
All right   now look.

165
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,220
We've all been put out by this whole thing   right?

166
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,190
So I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity.

167
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,940
Now   me and Fenster heard about a little job.

168
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,900
Why don't you just calm down?

169
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,110
What do you care what he says?

170
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,070
I'm just talking here.

171
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,790
It seems to me like Mr. Hockney wants to hear it   and I know Fenster's down.

172
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,370
What about you   guy?

173
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,120
I'm interested. Sure.

174
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,670
There. See?

175
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,960
Now I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly.

176
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,050
Why don't you just shut up?

177
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,640
You're missing the point.

178
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,810
No. You're missing the point.

179
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,150
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

180
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,770
I don't care about your job.

181
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,240
I want nothing to do with any of you.

182
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,160
I beg your pardon   but you can all go to hell.

183
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,040
Dean Keaton...

184
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,380
...gone the high road.

185
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,210
What is the world coming to?

186
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,090
Fuck him.

187
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,560
And that was how it started.

188
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,310
Us five being brought in on trumped-up charges to be leaned on by half-wits.

189
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,570
I really can't talk about it much here.

190
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,280
What the cops never figured out   and what I know now...

191
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,830
...was that these men would never break. Never lie down.

192
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,790
Never bend over for anybody.

193
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,250
Anybody.

194
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,060
Who are you?

195
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,310
Agent Jack Baer   FBI. How many dead?

196
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,810
Fifteen. They're still pulling bodies out of the water.

197
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,570
- Any survivors? - There's two.

198
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,150
One guy's in County Hospital in a coma.

199
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,490
The D.A. has the second guy   a cripple from New York.

200
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,870
The chief wants this place sealed off.

201
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,580
If you have any questions   give him a call.

202
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,320
This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

203
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,660
If you need me   contact Jeff Rabin...

204
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,540
...of the San Pedro Police Department at extension 112. Have a nice day.

205
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,920
- Why can't I see him? - I told you.

206
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,380
The D.A. was here ready to arraign even before they moved him to county.

207
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,430
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

208
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,930
...the D.A. comes out looking like the bogeyman smacked him.

209
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,270
They take his statement   and they cut him a deal.

210
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,980
- Did they charge him with anything? - Weapons.

211
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,480
Misdemeanor two.

212
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,110
What is that?

213
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,280
I give the D.A. credit for getting that much. You understand?

214
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,150
Excuse me   sir.

215
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,320
This thing has turned political.

216
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,040
The mayor was here last night   the chief.

217
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,330
This morning   the governor called.

218
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,790
This guy is protected from up on high...

219
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,920
...by the Prince of Darkness. Take my word for it.

220
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,460
- When does he post bail? - Two hours   tops.

221
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,300
- I wanna see him. - No   David.

222
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,380
I gotta see him   Jeffrey.

223
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,800
You gotta do this for me. I came a long way for this.

224
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,060
Dave   please.

225
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,230
Even if I let you talk to him   he won't talk.

226
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,190
He's paranoid about being recorded. He knows interrogation rooms are wired.

227
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,360
This won't be an interrogation. Just a friendly chat.

228
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,490
He won't go to the interrogation room.

229
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,870
- Then someplace else   then. - Where?

230
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,830
If this was a dope deal   where is it? If it was a hit   who called it in?

231
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,840
I'm sure you have wild theories to answer all these questions.

232
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,920
- You know what I think. - That's crazy.

233
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,930
He's got total immunity. His story checks out.

234
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,430
- He doesn't know what you wanna know. - I don't think he does. Not exactly.

235
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,520
There's a lot more to his story   believe me.

236
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,230
I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier...

237
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,820
...for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there.

238
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,490
And above all   I wanna be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

239
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,200
He's dead.

240
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,580
Come on. Two hours. Just till he makes bail.

241
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,580
They're all dead. I don't care how tough a guy Keaton was.

242
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,750
Nobody on that boat could've come out alive.

243
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,760
- Is he talking? - He regained consciousness and spoke.

244
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,470
- Not English. Then he lapsed. - Hungarian?

245
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,430
- I think so. - Most of them were Hungarians.

246
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,350
- Put on one of these. - Burn victims are subject to infection.

247
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,890
And of course   there's no smoking.

248
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,990
Keep your mask up. Don't touch him.

249
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,160
Is he gonna die?

250
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,870
He has burns over 60% of his body.

251
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,660
Get a man on the door till police get here.

252
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,000
Is he dangerous?

253
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,500
Yes. Do it. Do it now.

254
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,760
Joel? Yeah. Baer. Down at L.A. County.

255
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,050
Look   the guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

256
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,680
No   he's all fucked up.

257
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,600
I can't hear you.

258
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,440
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

259
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,650
Send me a Hungarian.

260
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,280
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

261
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,790
Keyser Soze!

262
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,210
No shit.

263
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,760
Joel   call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

264
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,680
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

265
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,590
Verbal   this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

266
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,920
Nice to meet you.

267
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,840
- He wants to ask you a few questions. - What about?

268
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,930
About Dean Keaton   mostly.

269
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,470
But I'd like to start at the lineup.

270
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,060
- Can I get some coffee? - Let's talk about the lineup.

271
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,610
I'm really thirsty. I used to dehydrate as a kid.

272
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,940
One time I got so bad my piss come out like snot.

273
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,820
I'll get your coffee.

274
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,070
Get me one too while you're at it.

275
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,870
That guy is tense.

276
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,580
Tension is a killer.

277
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,670
I used to be in a quartet in Skokie   Illinois.

278
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,710
The baritone was Kip Diskin. Big   fat guy. I mean   orca fat.

279
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,380
He was so stressed...

280
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,510
You know we're trying to help you.

281
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,590
Sure. And I appreciate that.

282
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,720
And I wanna help you   Agent Kujan. I like cops.

283
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,520
I would've liked to have been a fed but...

284
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,560
You're not telling us everything. I know you know something.

285
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,070
I told the D.A. everything I know.

286
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:37,570
Verbal   I know you like Keaton. I know you think he's a good man.

287
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,570
- I know he was good. - He was a corrupt cop.

288
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,620
Sure   15 years ago. But he was a good thief.

289
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,250
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

290
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,790
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

291
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,420
Are you trying to get a rise out of me   Agent Kujan?

292
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,630
I just wanna hear your story.

293
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,180
It's all there.

294
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,680
May I have a cigarette?

295
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,770
- According to... - I need a light.

296
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,110
According to your statement   you're a short-con operator.

297
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,990
According to your statement   you're a short-con operator.

298
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,290
Run-of-the-mill scams.

299
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,710
That's been suppressed. It's inadmissible.

300
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,040
I know.

301
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,380
Sweet deal you have. Total immunity.

302
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,550
Well   I do have the weapons charge.

303
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,010
I'm looking at six whole months hard time.

304
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,180
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

305
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,680
You know a religious guy named John Paul?

306
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,140
Ruby's in Attica.

307
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,730
- He didn't have my lawyer. - I know Ruby.

308
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,350
He's big on respect. He's a good friend of mine.

309
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
I know your testimony's sealed.

310
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,110
Ruby's got friends inside who do a lot of favors for him.

311
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,240
What would he say if he found out you dropped his name to the D.A.?

312
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,830
- There's nothing about Ruby. - I'll mention that to him.

313
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,870
First thing on the job   I learned to spot a murderer.

314
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,920
You arrest three guys for a killing. You put them in jail overnight.

315
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,290
Next day   whoever's sleeping is your man.

316
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,960
If you're guilty   you know you're caught. You let your guard down.

317
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,590
- You following me? - No.

318
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,840
Let me get to the point.

319
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,430
I'm smarter than you.

320
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,560
And I'll find out what I wanna know.

321
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,640
And I'm gonna get it from you.

322
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,690
I'm not a rat.

323
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,990
Thanks.

324
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,740
When I picked beans in Guatemala   we made fresh coffee.

325
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,580
Right off the trees   I mean.

326
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,960
That was good.

327
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,120
This is shit   but I'm at a police...

328
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,830
Can we get started again?

329
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,710
Now   what happened after the lineup?

330
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,100
The sergeant told me he couldn't release you.

331
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,220
Can you believe that? You weren't even charged.

332
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,060
Police!

333
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,980
I wanna take pictures of your face. I'll take them to the D.A.'s office.

334
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,230
Forget about it.

335
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,900
I'll have this at the grand jury by Monday.

336
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,160
I don't wanna talk about it   Edie.

337
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,950
What did Fortier and Renault say?

338
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,750
They asked for some more time.

339
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,580
They just want more time.

340
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,040
More time for what?

341
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,920
No matter how you cover me   they'll still find out about me.

342
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,210
Give me some credit.

343
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,550
I got you this far.

344
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,430
Let's go to the grand jury. This won't stop...

345
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,970
It's never gonna stop   period.

346
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,350
By next week   every investor is gonna be walking away from us.

347
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,520
It's finished.

348
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,560
I'm finished.

349
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,490
Don't give up on me now   Dean.

350
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,450
It's never gonna stop.

351
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,000
I love you.

352
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,670
They ruined me in there tonight.

353
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,800
I love you.

354
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,390
Do you hear me?

355
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,640
What?

356
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,530
Let's just go to my place.

357
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,880
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

358
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,670
Let's go.

359
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,600
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition.

360
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,640
A fast jump. High risk   long money.

361
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,520
We all knew it could be done.

362
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,440
I figured to do it wrong meant killing.

363
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,940
To do it right took five men.

364
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,190
Five men meant Keaton.

365
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,650
Keaton took convincing.

366
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,120
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

367
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,240
Bullshit.

368
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,500
Bullshit.

369
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,460
They don't operate anymore.

370
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,790
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct. They're doing one job.

371
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,420
They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds.

372
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,630
- McManus already has a fence set. - A fence? Who?

373
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,180
- Some guy in California. Redfoot. - I never heard of him.

374
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,560
You have to come.

375
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,270
- What's it to you whether I do or not? - They don't know me. You do.

376
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,730
They won't take me unless you go.

377
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,860
- Look at me. I need this. - Tough.

378
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,610
You're telling me you don't need this? Is this your place?

379
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,780
You look like you got a good little scam going with this lawyer.

380
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,250
Sorry.

381
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,500
It's okay.

382
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,670
You say it's the real thing. That's cool.

383
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,840
You okay?

384
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,720
I was out of line.

385
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,300
But they'll never stop with us. You know that.

386
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,010
As clean as you get   they won't let you go.

387
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,350
This way   we hit the cops where it hurts   and we get well in the meantime.

388
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,190
You're sure you're okay?

389
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,030
I'll be all right.

390
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,840
- I sometimes get... - Forget it.

391
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,680
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

392
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,360
How do they wanna do it?

393
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,200
McManus wants to go in shooting. I say no.

394
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,490
Fenster? Hockney?

395
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,410
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything.

396
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,670
I got a way to do it without killing anyone...

397
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,250
...but they won't let me in without you.

398
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,060
Three million?

399
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,400
Maybe more.

400
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,240
No killing?

401
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,200
Not if we do it my way.

402
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,860
New York's Finest Taxi Service wasn't a normal taxi.

403
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:01,160
It was a ring of corrupt cops that ran a high-profit racket...

404
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,540
...driving smugglers around the city.

405
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,120
For a few hundred dollars a mile   you got a police escort.

406
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,210
They even had business cards.

407
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,420
Somebody started asking questions   and the Taxi Service shut down.

408
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,170
Internal Affairs has been waiting to catch them in the act.

409
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,050
That's where we came in.

410
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,390
- So how was the flight? - Fucking great.

411
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,520
Will this get me to Staten Island?

412
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,150
You kidding me? This'll get you to Cape Cod.

413
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,320
McManus came to us with the job. Fenster got the vans.

414
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,860
Hockney   the hardware.

415
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,530
I figured out how to do it so no one died.

416
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,160
But Keaton   Keaton put on the finishing touch.

417
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,330
A little "fuck you" from the five of us to the NYPD.

418
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,500
All right   watch this. Watch this.

419
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,920
Careful   careful!

420
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,000
Come on   asshole.

421
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,960
Holy shit!

422
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,840
Don't move   you fuckers!

423
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,590
Drop it now   motherfucker.

424
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,220
Drop the fucking gun. Drop it.

425
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,850
What do you guys want?

426
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm a fucking cop   you stupid asshole!

427
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,230
Watch the glass!

428
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,520
- You want a buckshot shampoo   chubby? - Shut up!

429
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,030
Oh   fuck.

430
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,410
Good afternoon   my little pork chops. Give me the shit.

431
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,910
Give him the shit!

432
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,250
Give him the fucking shit   man!

433
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,040
Hurry up! Come on!

434
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,750
- Now the money. - There's no money.

435
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,550
There's no fucking money.

436
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,970
Give him the money.

437
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,470
Do it! Give him the money! Give him the money!

438
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,140
Hurry up!

439
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,060
Motherfucker   you know who I am?

440
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,230
Do you people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!

441
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,480
We do now   jerkoff.

442
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,450
Wait a minute. What's that?

443
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:05,780
What the fuck...?

444
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,700
Holy shit!

445
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,260
Keaton made an anonymous call.

446
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,760
The press was there before the police.

447
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,430
Strausz and Rizzi were indicted 3 days later.

448
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,770
Within a few weeks   50 more cops went down with them.

449
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,320
Everybody got it right in the ass from the chief on down.

450
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,400
It was beautiful.

451
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,240
I owe you $2.50.

452
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,000
Dr. Keaton.

453
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:59,170
- There's more than I thought. - When's the fence coming?

454
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,920
Redfoot never comes to see me. I always go to see him.

455
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,130
In California?

456
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,640
Yes   Verbal   in California. Fenster and I...

457
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,680
Wait. Hold the fucking phone.

458
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,230
You and Fenster? No   no   no.

459
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,850
You kidding me?

460
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,810
Okay   so everyone's gonna go?

461
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,820
We all go.

462
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,360
What's your fucking problem   man?

463
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,160
My problem is that you and Fenster are off in California...

464
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,030
...while we're sitting here holding our dicks.

465
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,330
The job's over.

466
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,000
Cool it.

467
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,120
L.A.'s a good place to lay low for a while.

468
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,380
You wanna dance?

469
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,260
Ladies.

470
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,900
I'd like to propose a toast.

471
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,980
There you go.

472
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,150
To Mr. Verbal...

473
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,700
...the man with the plan.

474
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,420
We'll miss the flight.

475
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,470
Don't do this. Send her a note   something.

476
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,180
I said we'll make it.

477
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,840
We're gonna miss the plane.

478
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,390
She'll understand.

479
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,160
That's heartwarming.

480
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,700
Really.

481
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,620
I'm weepy.

482
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,750
Jeff   you wanna wait outside?

483
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,920
You wanted to know what happened after the lineup.

484
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,590
Come on   Verbal.

485
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,970
Who do you think you're talking to?

486
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,090
Do you expect me to believe that he retired?

487
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,180
For a woman?

488
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,890
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

489
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,350
- He loved her. - Sure.

490
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,520
Hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea?

491
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,320
It was Fenster and McManus.

492
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,450
Keaton was a cop for four years. Who knew the Taxi Service better?

493
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,620
- That job was his. - But Edie had him turned around.

494
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,660
Let me tell you something.

495
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,330
I know Dean Keaton.

496
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,160
I've been investigating him for three years.

497
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,170
The guy I knew was a cold-blooded bastard.

498
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,550
I.A. indicted him on 3 counts of murder before he was kicked off the force.

499
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,710
He's not the hooker with the heart of gold.

500
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,680
You got him all wrong.

501
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,010
Do I?

502
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,770
Dean Keaton was under indictment seven times while he was on the force.

503
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,480
In every case   witnesses either reversed their testimony...

504
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,480
...or died before they could testify.

505
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,980
They finally nailed him for fraud.

506
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,650
He spent five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside.

507
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,910
Of course   I can't prove this.

508
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,240
But I can't prove the best part either.

509
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,670
Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that?

510
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,790
He died in a fire two years ago...

511
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,840
...during a murder investigation of a witness who would testify against him.

512
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,970
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into a warehouse just before it blew up.

513
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,520
They said he went in to check a leaking gas main.

514
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,940
It blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.

515
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,860
Within three months of the explosion...

516
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,530
...the two witnesses   they were dead.

517
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,820
One killed himself in his car...

518
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,160
...the other fell down an open elevator shaft.

519
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,950
Let's get this show on the road.

520
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,250
There are far too many people...

521
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,370
We'll be out of here before he blows his porch light.

522
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,000
- I have a noon meeting. - Five minutes.

523
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,000
Everyone just calm down.

524
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,880
I want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor.

525
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,770
- He says they were buying... - Dope. We know.

526
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,450
He doesn't know what they were buying   but not dope. People.

527
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,780
What?

528
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,170
He needs guarantees...

529
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,710
- What's he talking about? - He says his life is in danger.

530
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,430
He saw the devil   looked him in the eye.

531
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,050
- I'm on my way. - No   no   wait a minute.

532
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,180
Ask him to tell him what he told me.

533
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,230
About the devil.

534
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,100
Who's the devil?

535
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,490
Keyser Soze.

536
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,030
Keyser Soze?

537
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,740
He was in the harbor killing many men.

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,290
He saw Keyser Soze?

539
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,210
He saw his face.

540
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,760
All right   look. Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

541
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,430
Describe him.

542
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,560
Six weeks ago   I get a call saying I can find Keaton...

543
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,820
...eating at Mondino's with his attorney. There he is.

544
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,360
Because he never profited from his alleged death...

545
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,070
...and we convicted someone else of the murder...

546
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,950
...we had to let him go.

547
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,910
He was dead long enough for the murder rap to blow over.

548
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,790
And then he had lunch.

549
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,920
I don't know about that.

550
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,960
I don't think you do.

551
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,670
But you say you saw Keaton die.

552
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,590
You're covering him   and he's still out there.

553
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
He's behind the circus at the harbor.

554
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,550
He's using your stupidity. You think he's your friend.

555
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,350
You tell me he's dead   so be it.

556
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,190
I wanna be sure he's dead.

557
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,190
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.

558
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,270
What lawyer?

559
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,940
What lawyer?

560
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,110
When I was in that quartet in Skokie   Illinois...

561
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,410
I know you held out on the D.A.!

562
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,370
What did you leave out of that testimony? I can phone Ruby Deemer.

563
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,370
- The D.A. gave me immunity. - Not from me.

564
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,920
You get no immunity from me.

565
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,420
Every criminal I've put in prison or cop who owes me...

566
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,510
...every creep that works the street will know the name of Verbal Kint.

567
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,340
You talk to me or that immunity they deem so fit to grant you...

568
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,390
...won't be worth the paper the contract on your life is printed on.

569
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,770
There was a lawyer.

570
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,690
Kobayashi.

571
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,650
- Was he the one that killed Keaton? - No.

572
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,530
But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

573
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,400
Convince me.

574
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,120
And tell me every last detail.

575
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:29,470
We arrived in Los Angeles and met McManus' fence   Redfoot.

576
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,350
He had a good reputation. Seemed like a good guy.

577
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,560
Still   we should've known better.

578
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:36,650
How you doing?

579
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,360
- Good. You? - Not bad. Can't complain.

580
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,400
How's it going   Fenster?

581
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,320
No need to open it   right?

582
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,250
You must be Keaton.

583
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,120
Redfoot   Dean Keaton.

584
00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:00,540
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint. - Verbal   the man with a plan   huh?

585
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,710
Interested in any more work?

586
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,510
- We're always looking for work. - We're on vacation.

587
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,220
Oh   well. That's too bad.

588
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,220
I got a ton of work and no good people.

589
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,480
- Not like you guys. - What's the job?

590
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,600
There's this jeweler out of Texas named Saul.

591
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,900
He rents a suite in a downtown hotel.

592
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,610
He does appraisals. Sometimes he buys   sometimes he doesn't.

593
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,490
The word is   he carries around a lot of cash.

594
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:31,280
So I figure I keep the merchandise   you keep the green.

595
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,830
- It's simple. - What about security?

596
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,040
A couple of bodyguards. Nothing you couldn't handle.

597
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,540
Give me time to check it out?

598
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,040
I expect nothing less from you   man.

599
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,260
Good to see you. We'll call you.

600
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,510
Enjoy L.A. Get yourself laid.

601
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,270
A friend of mine in New York tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.

602
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,230
The way I hear it   you did time with old Spook.

603
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,110
Good man   wasn't he?

604
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,820
I used to run dope for him.

605
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,110
Too bad he got shivved.

606
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,740
I shivved him.

607
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,710
Better you hear it from me now   than from somebody else later.

608
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,870
I appreciate that.

609
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,840
Just out of curiosity...

610
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,510
...was it business or personal?

611
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,380
A bit of both.

612
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,180
Like I said...

613
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,890
...give me a call if you're interested.

614
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,150
Is there a problem?

615
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,400
One job.

616
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,360
That was the deal.

617
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,030
One job?

618
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,410
One job!

619
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,750
That's a good one   Keaton.

620
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,420
Keaton fought it   but a man can't change what he is.

621
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,590
He can convince anyone he's someone else   but never himself.

622
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,470
It took one day with McManus nagging   and we went back to work.

623
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,400
I get out of my car and it's wrecked.

624
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,950
I look in the back seat of the car   and this woman is naked.

625
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,990
I'm laughing so hard!

626
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,370
Get in the car   Saul.

627
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,210
Freeze   motherfucker! Right there!

628
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,830
Here we go.

629
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,220
Give me the case. Give me the fucking case!

630
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:00,770
Give me the fucking case.

631
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,810
I'm telling you for the last time   give me the fucking case!

632
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,530
Come on! Hey   don't move.

633
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,020
Just hand over the case.

634
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,230
Hand over the fucking case.

635
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,680
Come on   let's go!

636
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,680
- Come on! - Bad day. Fuck it.

637
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,310
Let's go   let's go!

638
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,830
Fuck!

639
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,210
Looks like a lot of China to me. Shit.

640
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,510
Guys   come on.

641
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,890
- What are you doing? - I'm gonna kill him.

642
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,770
We're gonna do it my way.

643
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,230
- You gonna kill him? - I'll deal with him.

644
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,770
- You better deal with him. - I'll deal with him. Shut up.

645
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,950
What do I do with that?

646
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,290
I don't know. Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.

647
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,870
- You don't know? - I don't know.

648
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,040
- I got thrown this job by some lawyer. - Who?

649
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,250
I don't know. Some limey.

650
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,800
He's a middleman for someone. He doesn't say   I don't ask.

651
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,510
- You're fucking full of shit. - Fuck you.

652
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,600
Listen to me. We wanna meet him.

653
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,520
That's funny.

654
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,690
He called me. Says he wants to meet you guys.

655
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,020
- We'll meet him. - I'll call.

656
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:57,780
- Good. Do that. No problem. - I don't like it. Wait a minute.

657
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,190
One more thing...

658
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,360
...any more surprises   and I'm gonna kill you.

659
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,490
You're such a tough guy.

660
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,660
Do me a favor   all right? Get the fuck off my dick.

661
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
Better put a leash on that puppy.

662
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,630
You know   it's an awful shame about Saul getting whacked.

663
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,800
Cops will be looking for the guys who did it.

664
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,760
Sooner or later   they'll come asking me.

665
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,310
You have a sweet night   ladies.

666
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,730
Fuck you.

667
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,030
So this lawyer...

668
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,910
Kobayashi.

669
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,950
...came from Redfoot. - Right.

670
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,750
Why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?

671
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,250
Dave   someone to see you.

672
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,840
Jack.

673
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,550
I been looking all over for you.

674
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,220
You still after that coke that took a walk from the bloodbath?

675
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:07,220
Well   you can stop looking. There was no coke.

676
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:12,600
I been talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe after the shootout.

677
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,770
He came to. He started talking.

678
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,980
He's part of a Hungarian mob dealing with some goats from Argentina.

679
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,110
- He says it wasn't a dope deal. - But the 91 million...

680
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,150
Our man says no way on the dope.

681
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:28,120
He tells me the bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

682
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,660
They had no time to negotiate   no means to move it.

683
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,870
- What's the money for? - He didn't know.

684
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,830
No one doing the deal knew   except a few people.

685
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,380
They were very hush about it   he says.

686
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,210
Whatever it was   it was very sensitive.

687
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,720
I don't get it.

688
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,220
You got the cripple in there from New York.

689
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,680
- Did he mention Keyser Soze? - Who?

690
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,850
Just bear with me here.

691
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,020
Who's Keyser Soze?

692
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:56,560
Fuck!

693
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,610
We've been going over this for an hour and a half.

694
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,490
What we need to do is find Redfoot and get out of here now.

695
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,070
What we need to do is think.

696
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,530
Think back.

697
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,290
Somebody with power...

698
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,750
...who was capable of tracking us from New York to L.A.

699
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,340
- What the hell are we doing here? - We're waiting.

700
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,880
Sit down.

701
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,340
No. It's hot   and I'm fucking bored.

702
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,840
Mr. Hockney   do stay.

703
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,510
Mr. Keaton.

704
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,010
Mr. Fenster   I recognize from his mug shots   as well as Mr. McManus.

705
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:34,390
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint...

706
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,100
...the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

707
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,730
My employer sends his gratitude. A most unexpected benefit.

708
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,820
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

709
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:48,700
I have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

710
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:52,080
- What do you want? - My employer requires your services.

711
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,290
One job.

712
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,670
One day's work. Very dangerous.

713
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,380
He doesn't expect all of you to live   but those who do...

714
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,460
...will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit.

715
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,590
Who's your boss?

716
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,260
I work for Keyser Soze.

717
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,440
Who's Keyser Soze?

718
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:28,610
Judging by the sudden change in mood   I'm sure your associates can tell you.

719
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,410
I come with an offer directly from Mr. Soze.

720
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,030
An order   actually.

721
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,410
What do you mean   "an order"?

722
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,960
In 1981   Mr. Keaton   you participated...

723
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,000
...in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo   New York.

724
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,550
The cargo was raw steel. Steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

725
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,880
...and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor.

726
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,050
A most profitable violation of UN regulations.

727
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,350
You had no way of knowing this.

728
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,600
The man shipping the steel was working for Mr. Soze...

729
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,310
...without his knowledge.

730
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,150
Earlier this year   Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus...

731
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,980
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.

732
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,610
The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring   also set for Pakistan.

733
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,450
Two months ago...

734
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,040
...Mr. Hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts through Queens.

735
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,830
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of New York.

736
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,750
They were to be lost in a way station and re-routed to Belfast.

737
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:29,050
Again   Mr. Soze using pawns who had no knowledge.

738
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,880
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

739
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,810
Nine months ago   one of Mr. Soze's less-than-intelligent couriers...

740
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,560
...was taken in a complicated confidence scam by a cripple.

741
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,400
He was relieved of $62  000.

742
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,690
Now   it has taken us some time to find you.

743
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,700
Our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York.

744
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,110
You set up the lineup.

745
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:57,280
You were not to be released until I had come to see you.

746
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,620
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney   Miss Finneran...

747
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,920
...was a little too effective...

748
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:06,750
...in expediting his release. Holding the rest was a moot point.

749
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,880
- What about Redfoot? - Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

750
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,470
Mr. Soze rarely works with the same people.

751
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,510
They never know who they work for.

752
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,930
One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.

753
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,730
So why are you telling us?

754
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,810
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze   Mr. Fenster. All of you.

755
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,940
That you did not know you did is the only reason you're still alive.

756
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,860
He feels you owe him.

757
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,200
You will repay your debt.

758
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:39,410
Fuck the debt and fuck you. How do we know you work for Soze?

759
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,540
I don't think that is very relevant   Mr. Hockney.

760
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,380
You all are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

761
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,760
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement. We can see that he will.

762
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,220
What's your point?

763
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,220
The offer is this   gentlemen.

764
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:59,260
Mr. Soze's primary interest is narcotics.

765
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,390
He has been competing   shall we say...

766
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,690
...with Argentineans for years now.

767
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,190
Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.

768
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,070
These Argentineans are negotiating the sale...

769
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,280
...of $91 million in cocaine in three days' time.

770
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,320
Needless to say   this purchase will revitalize...

771
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,740
...the diminishing strength of their organization.

772
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,540
Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.

773
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,040
If you choose   you may wait until after the buy.

774
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,960
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

775
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,800
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

776
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,020
And then you will be free of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

777
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,440
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.

778
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,480
A gift from Mr. Soze.

779
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,660
Good day   gentlemen.

780
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:10,140
They got my whole life in here. Everything I've ever done.

781
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,020
They know everything.

782
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,480
Everybody I've ever worked with or did time with.

783
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,290
- This isn't right. - I don't know.

784
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,550
Who's that guy used to talk about Soze in New York?

785
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,380
Bricks Marlin.

786
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,720
Yeah   he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff.

787
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,890
He made five times more money than it was worth.

788
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:53,480
This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's using him for window-dressing.

789
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,650
I don't know. This is bad.

790
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:59,940
No   it's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD. It's a fucking setup.

791
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,740
The way I hear it   Soze's some kind of a butcher.

792
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:06,120
A peerless   psycho   fucked-up butcher.

793
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,330
There is no Keyser Soze!

794
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,170
Who is Keyser Soze?

795
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,250
He's supposed to be Turkish.

796
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,500
Some say his father was German.

797
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,800
Nobody ever believed he was real.

798
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,090
Nobody knew him or saw anybody that worked directly for him.

799
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,100
To hear Kobayashi tell it   anybody could've worked for him.

800
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,390
You never knew. That was his power.

801
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:33,480
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...

802
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,900
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

803
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,690
One story the guys told me   the story I believe...

804
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:42,530
...was from his days in Turkey.

805
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:45,280
A gang of Hungarians wanted their own mob.

806
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,370
They realized that to be in power...

807
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,370
...you didn't need guns or money or even numbers.

808
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,250
You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.

809
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,630
After a while   they come into power. They went after Soze.

810
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,090
He was smalltime then. Just running dope   they say.

811
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,510
They come to his home in the afternoon...

812
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,260
...looking for his business.

813
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,770
They find his wife and kids and decide to wait for Soze.

814
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,080
He comes home...

815
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:32,200
...to find his wife raped and children screaming.

816
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,000
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough   not to be trifled with.

817
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,630
So they let him know they meant business.

818
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,840
They tell him they want his territory   all his business.

819
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:51,140
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

820
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:56,140
Then he showed these men of will what will really was.

821
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:18,790
He tells them he would rather see his family dead...

822
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,380
...than live another day after this.

823
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,760
He lets the last Hungarian go.

824
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,930
He waits until his family is in the ground   then goes after the mob.

825
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,800
He kills their kids. He kills their wives.

826
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,390
He kills their parents   their parents' friends.

827
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:37,180
He burns down the houses they live in...

828
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,770
...the stores they work in.

829
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,440
He kills people that owe them money.

830
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:43,900
And like that...

831
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,190
...he's gone.

832
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,450
Underground. Nobody's ever seen him since.

833
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,870
He becomes a myth. A spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.

834
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,330
"Rat on your pop   and Keyser Soze will get you."

835
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,040
And no one ever really believes.

836
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,210
Do you believe in him   Verbal?

837
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,590
Keaton always said:

838
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,340
"I don't believe in God but I'm afraid of him."

839
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,300
Well   I believe in God.

840
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:15,720
And the only thing that scares me...

841
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,890
...is Keyser Soze.

842
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,480
Do you give any weight to this?

843
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:30,740
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser. He's got a file on Soze in D.C.

844
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,700
It's a hobby of his.

845
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,660
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.

846
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,380
- You've heard of him? - Where? On the street?

847
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,340
Yeah   a few times. Outside stuff.

848
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,260
Somebody worked for a guy who got some money...

849
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,140
...from Keyser Soze. You know   shit like that.

850
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,390
It could be an old badge. A hex sign...

851
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,230
...to keep people from fucking with you.

852
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,560
- But you're here. - Well   shit   yeah.

853
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:06,070
A guy left a hospital on a fried drumstick because he's afraid of Soze.

854
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,360
I'll run it up the flagpole.

855
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:14,120
I came clean. So what if I left out how I got on the boat.

856
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:18,370
It's so full of holes   the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

857
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,660
Big fucking deal.

858
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,330
That's why you never told the D.A.?

859
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,830
You tell me   Agent Kujan.

860
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,130
If I said the Loch Ness monster hired me   what would you say?

861
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,130
Turn state's evidence. We'll put you on the stand.

862
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,380
I've got immunity. What can you offer?

863
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,180
If there is a Soze   he's gonna come for you.

864
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,050
Where's your head?

865
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,770
Where do you think the pressure's coming from?

866
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,560
Soze knows where I am now.

867
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:46,650
He's got a burner under you to let me go   so he can scoop me up later.

868
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:50,570
Immunity was just a deal with you. I got a new problem when I post bail.

869
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,780
Why play to him? We can protect you.

870
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:54,910
Gee   thanks   Dave.

871
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,950
Bang-up job so far. Extortion. Coercion.

872
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,700
Pardon me   kiss my pucker.

873
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:04,460
The fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are bailing me out?

874
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,460
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

875
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:14,010
You think he'd come this close to getting caught and stick his head out?

876
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,300
If he comes up   it'll be to get rid of me.

877
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,430
After that...

878
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,390
...my guess is   you'll never hear from him again.

879
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,170
What happened next?

880
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,790
The next morning Fenster was gone.

881
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,670
He couldn't handle the idea of slumming for Soze.

882
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,380
He left us a note and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.

883
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,970
Then what?

884
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,430
McManus was furious.

885
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,890
He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out.

886
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,810
That night we got the call.

887
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:08,310
What call?

888
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,190
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

889
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,410
All right. Let's get the fuck out of here.

890
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,750
We gotta bury him.

891
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,410
With what?

892
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,500
With our hands.

893
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:39,890
This is nuts.

894
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,260
It's dry fucking sand.

895
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:45,220
When he rots   the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away.

896
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,270
Fuck!

897
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,100
What are we gonna do? This guy's gonna kill us.

898
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:53,320
I don't know about you   but I can run. I got no problem with that.

899
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,280
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.

900
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,410
If you run...

901
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,280
...we'll be digging a hole for you. You got that?

902
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,200
This ain't my boy we're burying.

903
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,790
I don't owe anybody!

904
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:08,660
So fuck you.

905
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,080
He was my partner for five years.

906
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:14,590
We did more jobs and saw more money than you can count.

907
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,670
So fuck you!

908
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,300
Because now it's payback.

909
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,220
It's not payback!

910
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,510
It's precaution.

911
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:27,310
You want payback? You wanna run? I don't care.

912
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,940
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

913
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,650
I'm not doing it for you.

914
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:38,990
I'm doing this for me.

915
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,950
I'm gonna finish this thing.

916
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:47,120
This Kobayashi bastard isn't gonna stand on me.

917
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,730
After they killed Fenster   nobody ran?

918
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,270
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.

919
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,900
Why didn't you say anything?

920
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:18,320
I tried   but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him.

921
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:21,030
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

922
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,030
To a cop   the explanation is never that complicated.

923
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:28,450
There's no mystery to the street. No archcriminal behind it all.

924
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:32,080
If you got a body and think his brother did it   you're right.

925
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:36,340
Nobody argued with Keaton. They just set their minds to Kobayashi.

926
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,010
They're coming up.

927
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,980
Did you hear me? He's coming up.

928
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,850
He's on his way down.

929
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:52,040
Don't move.

930
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,540
Press 20. Do it now.

931
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,020
Move!

932
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,610
The answer is no.

933
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:24,150
- Mr. Soze will be most... - There is no Keyser Soze.

934
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,240
Mention him again   I'll kill you.

935
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,870
A strange threat. I can only assume you've come here to kill me anyway.

936
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,380
Now   we know that you can get to us.

937
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,090
But now you know that we can get to you.

938
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,670
I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.

939
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,220
Mr. S...

940
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:50,890
My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.

941
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,100
Neither do we.

942
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,770
You got Fenster   but you won't be able to get all of us.

943
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,560
Not before we get to you.

944
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,600
I believe you   Mr. McManus.

945
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,770
I most sincerely do.

946
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,690
You wouldn't be chosen were you not so suitable.

947
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,940
But I cannot make this decision.

948
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,620
What you threaten me with is ludicrous compared to what will be done to me...

949
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,830
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

950
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,210
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

951
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:28,590
I just wanted you to know that.

952
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,550
I'm so sorry   Mr. McManus.

953
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,470
I implore you   Mr. Keaton   believe me...

954
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,020
...Mr. Soze is very real and very determined.

955
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:39,640
We'll see.

956
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:50,400
Before you do me in   Mr. McManus...

957
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:54,660
...you'll let me finish my business with Ms. Finneran   won't you?

958
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:01,330
What did you say?

959
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,880
Edie Finneran.

960
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:06,590
She's upstairs. In my office.

961
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,670
For an extradition deposition.

962
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,550
I requested she be put on the case personally.

963
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,680
She flew in yesterday.

964
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,220
No matter.

965
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,940
Kill away   Mr. McManus.

966
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:26,770
You're lying.

967
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,650
Am I?

968
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,460
Ms. Finneran's escort while she's here in Los Angeles.

969
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:51,300
Never leaves her side.

970
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:54,720
I thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands.

971
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,770
Get some rest. The boat will be ready Friday.

972
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:04,480
If I see you or any of your friends before then...

973
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:09,110
...she'll find herself the victim of a gruesome violation before she dies.

974
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,900
As indeed   will your father   Mr. Hockney...

975
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,990
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona   Mr. Kint.

976
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,580
I might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew   David.

977
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,620
Do I make myself clear?

978
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,340
Take care of the bodies downstairs.

979
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:30,130
We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.

980
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:32,260
Excuse me   gentlemen.

981
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:13,130
It's a logistical nightmare.

982
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,720
Close quarters. Ten   maybe 20 men.

983
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:19,390
No telling how many more will be below deck.

984
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,680
- Can we stealth these guys? - No.

985
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,020
With all that coke   they're gonna be ready.

986
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:29,060
Which brings me to sunny point number two.

987
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,780
Even if we get through and jack the boat   we got nothing.

988
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,860
What if we wait for the money?

989
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,530
Ten more men at least.

990
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:40,990
Look   in my opinion   it can't be done.

991
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,200
Whoever goes there won't come out alive.

992
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:44,790
I'm gonna wait for the money.

993
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:48,460
- Me too. - Did you hear what he just said?

994
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:50,790
- If I'm going in   I want a cut. - Me too.

995
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,800
There's nothing that can't be done.

996
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,550
I can't believe we're walking into certain death.

997
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,270
The news said it's raining in New York.

998
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,540
What language is that?

999
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,130
I don't know.

1000
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,590
Russian   I think.

1001
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,510
Hungarian.

1002
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:47,240
The package has arrived   gentlemen.

1003
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:07,970
You kids ready?

1004
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,480
I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.

1005
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:16,020
I'm ready. McManus   you better be set up in 10 seconds.

1006
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,280
I'm ready.

1007
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,530
I want you to stay here.

1008
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,160
I'm supposed to cover...

1009
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:28,530
If we don't get out of this   take the money and go.

1010
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,410
Find Edie. Tell her what happened. She knows people and knows what to do.

1011
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:37,500
If I don't get Kobayashi my way   she'll get him her way.

1012
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,380
Just do what I say.

1013
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,460
Please.

1014
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:46,050
Tell her that...

1015
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,470
Tell her I tried.

1016
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:05,400
McManus...

1017
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:07,110
...he's on his way.

1018
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,570
I'm there.

1019
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:04,670
One   two   three   four...

1020
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,220
...five   six   seven...

1021
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,220
Oswald was a fag.

1022
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,610
How you doing?

1023
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,030
Is there... Is there a problem?

1024
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,470
Now.

1025
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,460
Old MacDonald had a farm

1026
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,510
E-I-E-I-O

1027
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:35,550
And on that farm he shot some guys

1028
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:38,270
Bada-boom Bada-bing-bang-boom

1029
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,630
Elvis has left the building.

1030
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:35,230
Why didn't you run?

1031
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,240
I froze up.

1032
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:41,370
I thought about Fenster   how he looked when we buried him.

1033
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:44,950
I thought about Keaton. It looked like he might pull it off.

1034
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:56,210
A boy came across a body on the beach today. Shot twice in the head.

1035
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,970
Two guys from the Bureau just identified him.

1036
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,430
Arturro Marquez. A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1037
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,390
Arrested last year in New York for trafficking.

1038
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,140
He escapes to California. They pick him up in Long Beach.

1039
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:12,520
They're setting up extradition   he escapes again.

1040
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,150
Now   get this.

1041
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,740
Edie Finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings.

1042
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,150
Kobayashi.

1043
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:22,530
New York faxed me a copy of his testimony. He was a rat.

1044
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,780
A big rat.

1045
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,790
Arturro was very opposed to returning to prison.

1046
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,960
So much so that he named close to 50 people.

1047
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,750
Guess who he named in the finale?

1048
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:36,050
Keyser Soze.

1049
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,880
There's more.

1050
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,520
I'll tell you what I know.

1051
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:54,400
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1052
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:58,150
There was no dope on that boat.

1053
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,150
You   stay quiet.

1054
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,780
He is here.

1055
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,320
I know he is here.

1056
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:47,120
That's him. I'm telling you   that's him.

1057
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,240
I know he is here!

1058
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:53,000
- You can't understand. That's him. - Shut up!

1059
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,670
That's him! You hear me?

1060
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,420
I'm telling you   it's Keyser Soze!

1061
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:58,000
- Where's Hockney? - I don't know.

1062
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,790
There's no coke!

1063
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,380
You heard me   you dumb fuck! There's no coke!

1064
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:07,130
I've been up and down this ship! Every fucking room!

1065
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:09,300
There is nothing!

1066
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:10,970
Nothing!

1067
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,550
Don't you fuck with me!

1068
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:16,970
There is no fucking coke!

1069
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:29,200
I'm out of here.

1070
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:12,410
I told them nothing.

1071
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,700
I swear.

1072
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,830
I told them nothing. Please.

1073
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:04,960
McManus.

1074
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:07,040
What the fuck is going on?

1075
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,630
The strangest thing...

1076
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:09,230
You say you saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1077
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,020
- Wait a minute. - No.

1078
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:14,740
You saw Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.

1079
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:16,740
I know there was dope there.

1080
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:19,030
You know what I'm getting at!

1081
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,780
Get out of my face.

1082
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,000
I've got immunity. I don't have to take that shit!

1083
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,290
You know what I'm getting at.

1084
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:30,460
The truth! Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.

1085
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,920
- I did. - You're lying to me!

1086
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,550
You've known this whole fucking time.

1087
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,840
I don't know what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot.

1088
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:42,010
Then why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1089
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:43,810
He was your friend.

1090
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:49,850
Because I was afraid.

1091
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,650
Okay?

1092
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,230
- Afraid. - Afraid of what?

1093
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,740
I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1094
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:02,160
It was Keyser Soze   Agent Kujan. I mean   the devil himself.

1095
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,700
How do you shoot the devil in the back?

1096
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,960
What if you miss?

1097
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,260
All right. Let's get back to the pier.

1098
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,180
Ever hear of Arturro Marquez?

1099
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:45,890
What? No.

1100
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:48,640
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department.

1101
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:52,180
He swore out a statement saying that he had seen...

1102
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,400
...and could positively identify one Keyser Soze.

1103
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:57,940
It says right here:

1104
01:32:58,230 --> 01:33:02,400
"He had knowledge of his businesses   including but not exclusive...

1105
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:05,870
...to trafficking and murder." - I never heard of him.

1106
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,620
His own people were selling him to Hungarians.

1107
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:12,580
Most likely the Hungarians that Soze all but wiped out in Turkey.

1108
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:14,120
The money wasn't for dope.

1109
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:19,130
The Hungarians were buying the one guy that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1110
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,590
I never heard of him.

1111
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,760
Keaton did. Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition adviser.

1112
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,720
She knew what he knew.

1113
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:29,720
- I don't... - There were no drugs on that boat.

1114
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:33,600
It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one guy...

1115
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:35,900
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1116
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,060
Soze put some thieves to it.

1117
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,820
Men he knew he could march into certain death.

1118
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:43,690
You're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?

1119
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:47,530
Keaton did. He left you behind for a reason.

1120
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:49,620
Just do what I tell you.

1121
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:52,700
If you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere...

1122
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:56,870
...why did he give you the money to run? He could use you on the boat.

1123
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,670
He wanted me to live.

1124
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,340
A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world wants to save...

1125
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,880
...a worthless cripple?

1126
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,760
No   sir. Why?

1127
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:11,930
- Edie. - I don't buy that reform story.

1128
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:16,980
Even if I did   I don't believe he would send you to protect her.

1129
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,810
So why?

1130
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,610
Because he was my friend.

1131
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:27,150
No   Verbal. He wasn't your friend. Keaton didn't have friends.

1132
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:28,240
Why are you here?

1133
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:32,370
He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.

1134
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,950
Keaton was Keyser Soze!

1135
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:39,170
He could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus.

1136
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:44,420
He could engineer a police lineup through his contacts in NYPD.

1137
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:47,260
He's a man who could've killed Edie Finneran!

1138
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:57,180
She was found yesterday in a hotel in Pennsylvania   shot twice in the head.

1139
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:04,280
What do you think about Keaton now?

1140
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,400
Edie?

1141
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:10,910
He used you to get on the boat. He couldn't get on alone.

1142
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,700
He had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man.

1143
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,950
The one man that could identify him.

1144
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:19,750
This is all bullshit.

1145
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
You said you saw him die.

1146
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:25,420
Or did you?

1147
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:27,800
You hid when you heard the police.

1148
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:30,680
You said you heard the shot before the fire.

1149
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:32,850
But you didn't see him die.

1150
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:34,470
I knew him. He'd never...

1151
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,140
He programmed you.

1152
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:40,770
He programmed you to tell us what he wanted you to. He knew we were close.

1153
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:44,110
Where was the pressure coming from? Why were you protected?

1154
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,190
It was Keaton. Immunity was your reward.

1155
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,110
But why me?

1156
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,820
Why not Fenster   McManus or Hockney? Why me?

1157
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:53,950
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple.

1158
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,830
Because you're a cripple.

1159
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,910
Because you're stupid.

1160
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,250
Because you're weaker than them.

1161
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,750
If he's dead...

1162
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:10,170
...if what you say is true   then it won't matter.

1163
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:14,470
It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service   wasn't it?

1164
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,810
- Come on   tell me the truth. - It was all Keaton.

1165
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,270
We followed him from the beginning.

1166
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,560
I didn't know.

1167
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:27,270
I saw him die.

1168
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:31,320
I believe he's dead. Oh   Christ!

1169
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:33,700
You're not safe on your own.

1170
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:39,040
You think he's...

1171
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:41,040
Keyser Soze?

1172
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,120
I don't know   Verbal.

1173
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:48,750
Keyser Soze's a shield. Or like you said   "a spook story."

1174
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,590
But I know Keaton. And someone is out there pulling strings for you.

1175
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:57,810
- Stay here and let us protect you. - I'm not bait. I post today.

1176
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,350
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1177
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:02,060
Capt. Leo wants you out of here ASAP.

1178
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:05,270
- Unless you turn state's. - I'll take my chances.

1179
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,030
If someone wants to get you   they're gonna get you out there.

1180
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,570
Turn state's evidence. You might never see trial.

1181
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:14,410
Maybe so.

1182
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:18,080
But I'm not a rat   Agent Kujan.

1183
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:36,300
Fucking cops!

1184
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:02,910
Excuse me. Can I use your fax machine?

1185
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:10,090
You'll have to sign for these   Mr. Kint.

1186
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,460
One watch   gold.

1187
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,930
One cigarette lighter   gold.

1188
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,840
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1189
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:21,560
We still got nothing   Dave.

1190
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:23,930
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

1191
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,730
Which is nothing.

1192
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:27,400
No matter.

1193
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:29,770
He'll have to know how close we came.

1194
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:32,980
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1195
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:36,360
...if Keaton is alive   he's not coming up again.

1196
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,030
I'll find him.

1197
01:38:38,990 --> 01:38:40,530
Waste of time.

1198
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,750
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1199
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,370
What?

1200
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:49,210
Nothing.

1201
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:52,710
Man   you're a slob.

1202
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,090
Yeah   but it all has a system   Dave.

1203
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:00,550
It don't make sense when you look right at it. You gotta stand back from it.

1204
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:05,350
Wanna see a real horror show? You should see my garage.

1205
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:43,800
Convince me.

1206
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:47,020
When I was in that quartet in Skokie...

1207
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:48,810
Where's your head?

1208
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,270
What we need to do is think. Think back.

1209
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,480
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.

1210
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:55,860
- This isn't right. - I just want your story.

1211
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:58,740
It's all there. I'm telling it straight   I swear.

1212
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:00,860
- guy in California named Redfoot.

1213
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:02,870
A gift from Mr. Soze.

1214
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:06,700
- What about Redfoot? - Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

1215
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:09,580
Big   fat guy. I mean   orca fat.

1216
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,960
- There was a lawyer. - Kobayashi.

1217
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,330
- never see him again.

1218
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:16,550
- in Guatemala   we made fresh coffee.

1219
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,670
...- thought he was a good man. - I know he was good.

1220
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:23,970
And tell me every last detail.

1221
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:26,510
How do you shoot the devil in the back?

1222
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,270
He's protected from up on high by the Prince...

1223
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,190
What about it   pretzel man?

1224
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,310
- There was a lawyer. - What lawyer?

1225
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,400
- I am Mr. Kobayashi. - Kobayashi. Kobayashi.

1226
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:39,030
Tell me every last detail.

1227
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,110
I work for Keyser Soze.

1228
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:43,570
Convince me.

1229
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:02,680
Every creep that walks the street will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1230
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:06,640
The cripple   did you see him? Which way did he go?

1231
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:08,010
He went out that way.

1232
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:10,470
I know you know something.

1233
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:14,150
I'm smarter than you. And I'll find out what I wanna know.

1234
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:17,820
To a cop   the explanation is never that complicated.

1235
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:20,990
There's no mystery to the street. No archcriminal...

1236
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:25,740
Somebody with power   who was capable of tracking us from New York to L.A.

1237
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:29,740
You think he'd come this close to getting caught...

1238
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,370
...and stick his head out?

1239
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:35,710
Because you're stupid. Because you're a cripple.

1240
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,460
You've known the whole fucking time!

1241
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:43,880
Keaton's dead.

1242
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:47,260
I can't feel my legs   Keyser.

1243
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:51,060
First thing I learned on the job was how to spot a murderer.

1244
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:54,520
- the cripple from New York   he mention Keyser Soze?

1245
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:56,350
Who?

1246
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,020
And after that...

1247
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:01,360
...my guess is   you'll never hear from him again.

1248
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,300
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...

1249
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,430
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1250
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:30,390
And like that...

1251
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,470
...he's gone.

1252
01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:56,090
