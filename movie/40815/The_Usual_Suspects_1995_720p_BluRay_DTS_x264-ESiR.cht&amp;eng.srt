@只是警告
It's precaution.

想那就去  想跑路的就跑吧 我不在乎
You want payback? You wanna run? I don't care.

我很y穹他
It was too far-fetched for him.

927
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,000
基D很固  他曾是T警
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

928
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,000
T警是不接受}s的解的
To a cop   the explanation is never that complicated.

是容易受_
It's always simple.

930
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,400
不信街上的流言   不信幕後有黑手
There's no mystery to the street   no arch-criminal.

931
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,200
看到一就是二
You got a body and think his brother did it   you're probably right.

Nobody argued with Keaton.

-他不改主意的 -我也不

You got Fenster   but you won't be able to get all of us.

他利用你掩o他上船
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

Why me? I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?
