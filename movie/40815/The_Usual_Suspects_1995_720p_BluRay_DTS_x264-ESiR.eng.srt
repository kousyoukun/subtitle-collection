1
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,000
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,300
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,300
Keyser

4
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,700
Ready?

5
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
What time is it?

6
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,300
12:30

7
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,800
It all started back in New York six weeks ago.

8
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,500
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
The driver didn't see anyone, but someone fucked up.

10
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,700
He heard a voice. Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,800
- Mr.McManus? - Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

12
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,100
- We have a warrant for your arrest. - Fuck you, pig.

13
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,400
Todd Hockney?

14
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,000
- Who wants to know? - New York Police Department.

15
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,400
- Shit. - Freeze!

16
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
Hold it!

17
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Sure you brought enough guys?

18
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,500
It's quite simple:

19
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,400
A restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic.

20
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,700
In other words...

21
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,900
...the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls.

22
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,100
- Let me give you an example-- - This I had to see for myself.

23
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
David

24
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,000
- I'm in a meeting. - Time for another one.

25
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,600
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

26
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,700
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

27
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,600
These gentlemen are from the New York Police Department.

28
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,600
You look good. Better than I would have thought.

29
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,600
A small matter of a stolen truck loaded with guns.

30
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Mr.Keaton?

31
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Will you excuse us for a moment?

32
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,200
We have some questions to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

33
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,300
No. Please, sit down.

34
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
This is a small problem.

35
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,000
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

36
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,400
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

37
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,200
These guys were hard-core hijackers...

38
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
...but there I was.

39
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
At that point, I wasn't scared.

40
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,800
I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for.

41
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,500
Besides, it was fun.

42
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,400
I got to make like I was notorious.

43
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,900
You all know the drill.

44
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,700
When your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given.

45
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Number 1, step forward.

46
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,700
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

47
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Number 2, step forward.

48
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,000
Gimme the fuckin' keys, you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

49
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,700
Knock it off. Get back. Number 3, step forward.

50
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,200
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker." - In English, please.

51
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,300
- Excuse me? - In English.

52
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker. What the fuck?

53
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,100
Number 4, step forward.

54
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,100
It was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup.

55
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,400
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

56
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,200
It was the cops' fault.

57
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,400
You don't put guys like that into a room together.

58
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,600
Who knows what can happen?

59
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,100
"Hand me the keys you fucking cocksucker."

60
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,300
This has really got to be embarrassing for you guys.

61
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
They drilled us all night.

62
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,000
Someone was mad about that truck hijacking and the cops had nothing.

63
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,300
They were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something.

64
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,300
They knew we wouldn't fight, they knew how to lean on us.

65
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,500
They've been doing it forever. Our rights went out the window.

66
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,500
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

67
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,400
They went after McManus first. Topnotch entry man.

68
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,900
What truck?

69
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,400
- The truck with the guns, fucko. - "Fucko"?

70
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,900
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.

71
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
Wanna know what your pal Fenster told us?

72
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,800
- Say who? - McManus.

73
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,600
He told us another story.

74
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,400
Is that the one about the hooker with the dysentery?

75
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,700
Fenster always worked with McManus. He was a real tight-ass.

76
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,000
But when it came to the job, he was right on. A smart man.

77
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,800
- What are you saying? - I said he'll flip you.

78
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
- He'll what? - Flip you. Flip you for real.

79
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,300
- I'm shaking. Come on. - Okay.

80
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
- Answer my questions. - Can you hear me in the back?

81
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Hello?

82
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,700
I want my lawyer.

83
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm gonna have your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

84
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,500
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.

85
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
Without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

86
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,200
You guys don't have a fuckin' leg to stand on.

87
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,500
You think so, tough guy?

88
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,100
I can put you in Queens during the hijacking.

89
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
Really?

90
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,200
I live in Queens.

91
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Did you put that together yourself, Einstein?

92
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,300
You got a team of monkeys working full time on this?

93
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,700
You know what happens if you do another turn in the joint?

94
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
I fuck your father in the shower, and have a snack.

95
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,200
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead? - I'll charge you when I'm ready.

96
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,000
- With what? - You know damn well, dead man.

97
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
But Keaton?

98
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,900
Keaton was the real prize for them for obvious reasons.

99
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,700
It was your mistake, not mine.

100
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,400
Did you ever stop to ask me?

101
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I've been walking around with the same face, the same name.

102
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,900
I'm a businessman.

103
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,100
What's that? The restaurant business?

104
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,100
No. From now on you're in the "getting fucked by us" business.

105
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

106
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
Like I said...

107
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,700
...it was your mistake

108
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
...not mine.

109
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,100
You charge me with this shit...

110
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
...and I'll beat it.

111
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay?

112
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,800
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

113
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Really, somebody's got to do something about this shit.

114
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,800
They put me in holding every five minutes. So I did a little time.

115
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,300
Does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds it's way gone?

116
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,700
Fuck 'em.

117
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,000
Fenster, will you relax?

118
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,500
- These guys don't have any probable cause. - You fuckin' right. No PC.

119
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,100
You're goddamn right. You do some time, never let you go.

120
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,600
They treat me like a criminal.

121
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,700
- I'll end up a criminal. - You are a criminal.

122
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,700
Why'd you got to go and do that?

123
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,500
- I'm trying to make a point. - Why don't you make your point?

124
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,800
You're making me tired all over.

125
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Fuck it then.

126
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,900
- I heard you were dead. - Yeah?

127
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
- You heard right. - Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

128
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,700
- What's that all about? - What's this?

129
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight. I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

130
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Who's that?

131
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,400
She's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown.

132
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,400
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

133
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
How 'bout it, Keaton?

134
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,300
You a lawyer's wife?

135
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,000
What kind of retainer you giving her?

136
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,000
Do your friend a favor...tell him to keep quiet.

137
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,500
Dean Keaton...

138
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Gone clean?

139
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,700
Say it ain't so.

140
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,300
- Or was it you that hit that truck? - Mac, forget him.

141
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,900
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

142
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
This whole thing was a shakedown.

143
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,200
- What makes you say that? - How many times you been in a lineup?

144
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,600
It's always you and four dummies.

145
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,900
The PD are paying homeless guys $10 a head half the time.

146
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,400
There's no way they'd line five felons in the same row.

147
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,300
What's a voice lineup? Public defender could get you out of that.

148
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,900
- Why the hell was I strip searched? - It was the feds.

149
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,500
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

150
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,300
Customs comes down on NYPD for answers. They come up with us.

151
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,700
- They're clutching at straws. - I had a guy's finger up my ass.

152
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,100
Is it Friday already?

153
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,400
Yeah, lover boy.

154
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,700
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

155
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,500
So who in the goddamn piss hell stole our fucking truck?

156
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
- What did you say? - Who stole the fucking truck?

157
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,700
- I don't want to know. - Who asked you, workingman?

158
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,500
Fuck who did it. What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

159
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,900
- He's okay. - Says you. How do I know that?

160
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,000
What about it, pretzel man? What's your story?

161
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,400
His name is Verbal.

162
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
Verbal Kint.

163
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,000
- Verbal? - Yeah.

164
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,200
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

165
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,400
I was going to tell you to shut up.

166
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,200
- We met before, once or twice. - In County. I was in for fraud.

167
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,500
You were in a lineup then, too. What happened?

168
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,500
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

169
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,600
- So you did it. - All right, now look...

170
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,700
...we've all been put out by this whole thing, right?

171
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,600
I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity.

172
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,400
Now, me and Fenster heard about a little job.

173
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
Why don't you just calm down?

174
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,700
What do you care what he has to say?

175
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,700
I'm just talking here.

176
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,200
It seems to me like Mr.Hockney wants to hear it...

177
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
...and I know Fenster's down.

178
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,800
What about you, guy?

179
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm interested.

180
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,100
There. See?

181
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,500
I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly.

182
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,500
Why don't you just shut up?

183
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,100
You're missing the point.

184
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,900
No.

185
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,900
You're missing the point.

186
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,600
I don't want to hear anything from you.

187
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
I don't care about your job.

188
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,100
And...

189
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,800
...I want nothing to do with any of you.

190
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,500
I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell.

191
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,500
Dean Keaton...

192
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
...gone the high road.

193
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,400
What is the world coming to?

194
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
Fuck him.

195
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,000
And that was how it started:

196
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,500
Five of us brought in on a trumped-up charge...

197
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,500
...to be leaned on by half-wits.

198
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,300
I really can't talk about it much here.

199
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,000
What the cops never figured out, and what I know now...

200
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,300
...was that these men would never break, never lie down.

201
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,300
Never bend over for anybody.

202
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
Anybody.

203
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,700
- Who are you? - Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

204
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
- How many dead? - 15 so far.

205
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,900
They're still pulling bodies out of the water.

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
- Any survivors? - Two.

207
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,900
One guy's in County hospital, but he's in a coma.

208
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,000
The DA has a second guy, a cripple from New York.

209
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,500
The chief wants this place sealed off.

210
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,400
If you have any questions, give him a call.

211
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,800
This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

212
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,100
If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro Police Department...

213
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.

214
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
- Why can't I see him? - I told you...

215
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
...the DA came down here last night ready to arraign...

216
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,600
...even before they moved him to County.

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

218
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,600
...the DA comes out looking like the bogeyman smacked him around.

219
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,800
They take his statement, and they cut him a deal.

220
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,900
- Did they charge him with anything? - Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

221
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,700
What is that?

222
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,900
I give the DA credit for getting that much, you understand?

223
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
Excuse me, sir.

224
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,700
This whole thing has turned political. The mayor was here last night.

225
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,100
The chief. This morning, the governor called, okay?

226
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm telling you, this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

227
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,900
- Take my word for it. - When does he post bail?

228
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,200
- Maybe two hours, tops. - I want to see him.

229
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,100
- No. - I gotta see him.

230
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,800
- No. I can't-- - You gotta do this for me.

231
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,100
I came a long way for this.

232
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,300
Dave, please.

233
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you.

234
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,000
He's paranoid about being recorded.

235
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,600
- He knows the rooms are wired. - I quit.

236
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
This won't be an interrogation, just a friendly chat.

237
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,000
- He won't go into the interrogation room. - Then someplace else.

238
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
Where?

239
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,500
No, no.

240
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,400
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope? If it was a hit, who called it?

241
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions.

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,400
- You know what I think. - That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

243
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,300
The guy's got total immunity. His story checks out.

244
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,900
- He doesn't know what you want to know. - I don't think he does, not exactly.

245
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,900
But there's a lot more to his story, believe me.

246
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,900
I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier...

247
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,300
...for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there.

248
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,900
And above all, I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

249
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,700
He's dead.

250
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Come on. Two hours. Just till he makes bail.

251
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,900
They're all dead.

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
I don't care how tough you say Keaton was...

253
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,300
...nobody on that boat could've come out alive.

254
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
- Is he talking? - He regained consciousness an hour ago.

255
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

256
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
- Hungarian? - That might have been it.

257
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,600
- Most of them were Hungarians. - You gotta put this on.

258
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,300
Burn victims are very susceptible to infection.

259
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,300
And, of course, there's no smoking.

260
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,600
Keep your mask up. Please don't touch him.

261
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,800
Is he gonna die?

262
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,600
He's burned 60 percent of his body, broken ribs--

263
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,300
Call security. Put a man on the door.

264
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,500
- Is he dangerous? - Yes.

265
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Do it.

266
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,900
Do it now.

267
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

268
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,500
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

269
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,400
Yes, I'm sure.

270
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,600
No, he's all fucked up.

271
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,100
I can't hear you.

272
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,800
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

273
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Yes.

274
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,300
No, not till I put a man on him.

275
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,800
Send me someone who can speak Hungarian.

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,700
He's awake. He's talking like a Thai hooker.

277
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,100
Keyser Soze.

278
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,700
- What? - Keyser Soze!

279
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
No shit?

280
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,100
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

281
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,700
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

282
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,000
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

283
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,300
Nice to meet you.

284
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,900
He wants to ask you a few questions before you go.

285
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,500
- What about? - About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

286
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,200
I'd like to start at the lineup back in New York.

287
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,600
- Can I get some coffee? - In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

288
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,100
I'm really thirsty. I used to dehydrate as a kid.

289
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,500
Once I got so bad my piss come out like snot.

290
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
- It was all thick and gooey-- - I'll get your fucking coffee.

291
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,200
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

292
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,300
That guy is tense.

293
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
Tension is a killer.

294
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,300
I used to be in a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.

295
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,300
The baritone was this guy named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

296
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Like, orca fat. He was so stressed in the morning--

297
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,100
- You know we're trying to help you. - Sure, and I appreciate that.

298
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,300
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops.

299
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,000
I would've liked to have been a fed, but my CP--

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You're not tellin' us everything. I know you know something.

301
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I told the DA everything I know.

302
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,500
I know you like Keaton.

303
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,700
- I know you think he's a good man. - I know he was good.

304
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,200
He was a corrupt cop.

305
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,000
Sure. 15 years ago, but he was a good thief.

306
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,700
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

307
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,900
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

308
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,800
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

309
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,700
- I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.

310
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,300
May I have a cigarette?

311
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,400
- According to your statement-- - I need a light.

312
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,800
According to your statement, you're a short-con operator...

313
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,500
...run-of-the-mill--

314
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,300
According to your statement, you're a short-con operator...

315
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,600
...run-of-the-mill scams.

316
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,500
It's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.

317
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,900
I know. Sweet deal you have here. Total immunity.

318
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,500
I do have the weapons charge. I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

319
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,700
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

320
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,200
You know a religious guy named John Paul?

321
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
- You know Ruby's in Attica? - He didn't have my lawyer.

322
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,400
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

323
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,900
He's a good friend of mine, likes me very much.

324
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby's well connected.

325
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,800
He's got lots of friends inside who do favors for him.

326
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,700
What would he say if he found out you dropped his name to the DA?

327
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,500
- There's nothing there on Ruby. - I'll be sure to mention that to him.

328
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,600
Know what I've learned on the job? How to spot a murderer.

329
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
Say you arrest three guys for the same killing.

330
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,600
Put them in jail overnight.

331
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
Next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man.

332
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,700
If you're guilty, you know you're caught. You let your guard down.

333
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,000
- You follow me? - No.

334
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,700
Let me get to the point.

335
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm smarter than you, and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

336
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,100
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

337
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,800
I'm not a rat.

338
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
Thanks.

339
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,500
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.

340
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,600
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

341
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,500
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station. - Can we get started again?

342
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,800
What happened after the lineup?

343
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,700
The desk sergeant was telling me he couldn't release you.

344
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,000
Can you believe that? You weren't even charged.

345
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
Damn police.

346
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,600
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

347
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,800
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow. - Forget about it.

348
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,600
I'll have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.

349
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,600
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

350
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
What did Fortier and Renault say?

351
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,600
They asked for more time to think about investing.

352
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Damn it.

353
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,400
More time for what?

354
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,400
No matter how you cover my tracks they're still gonna find out about me.

355
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,600
Give me some credit.

356
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,200
I got you this far. Let's go to the grand jury.

357
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,400
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't-- - It's never going to stop, period.

358
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,200
By next week, every investor in the city is gonna be walking away from us.

359
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,100
It's finished.

360
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm finished.

361
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,600
Don't give up on me now.

362
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
It's never gonna stop.

363
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,300
I love you.

364
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,700
They ruined me in there tonight.

365
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,000
I love you.

366
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
Do you hear me?

367
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,100
What?

368
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,000
All right.

369
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Let's just go to my place.

370
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

371
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,100
Let's go.

372
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,300
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition:

373
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,900
A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.

374
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,100
We all knew it could be done.

375
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,000
The way I figured, to do it wrong meant killing.

376
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,400
To do it right took five men.

377
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,700
Five men meant Keaton.

378
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,900
Keaton took convincing.

379
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,600
New York's finest taxi service.

380
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,700
Bullshit.

381
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,800
Bullshit.

382
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
They don't operate anymore.

383
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,400
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct. They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

384
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,400
They're pickin' up a guy smuggling emeralds from South America.

385
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,300
McManus already has a fence set up.

386
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
- A fence? Who? - Some guy in California called Redfoot.

387
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
- I never heard of him. - You have to come.

388
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,900
- What's it to you whether I do it or not? - They don't know me. You do.

389
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,500
They won't take me unless you go.

390
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,600
Look at me. I need this.

391
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,900
You're telling me you don't need this? Is this your place?

392
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,800
I'm not knocking you. You got a good scam going with this lawyer.

393
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,700
Sorry.

394
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,600
It's okay.

395
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,500
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

396
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,300
You okay?

397
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,400
I was out of line.

398
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,100
But they're never gonna stop with us. You know that.

399
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,900
As clean as you get, they'll never let you go now.

400
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,000
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts, and we get well in the meantime.

401
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,500
You sure you're okay?

402
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,500
I'll be all right.

403
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,400
Look, I...

404
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,600
- ...sometimes get-- - Forget it.

405
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,400
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

406
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,600
So...

407
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,200
...how do they wanna do it?

408
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,400
McManus wants to go in shooting. I say no.

409
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,200
Fenster? Hockney?

410
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,100
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything.

411
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,600
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

412
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,900
But like I say, they won't let me in without you.

413
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,400
$3 million?

414
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,800
Maybe more.

415
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,800
No killing.

416
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,300
Not if we do it my way.

417
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,500
New York's finest taxi service was not your normal taxi service.

418
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,500
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD that ran a high-profit racket...

419
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,100
...driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city.

420
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,800
For $300 a mile, you got your own blue and white...

421
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,900
...and a police escort. They even had their own business cards.

422
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,200
After a while, somebody started asking questions, and the taxi service shut down.

423
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,900
Ever since then, Internal Affairs has been waiting to catch them in the act.

424
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,600
That's where we came in.

425
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,100
- So, how was the flight? - Fuckin' great.

426
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,400
Will this get me to Staten Island?

427
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,900
Are you kiddin' me? This will get you to Cape Cod.

428
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,900
McManus came to us with the job. Fenster got the vans.

429
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,600
Hockney supplied the hardware.

430
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,300
I came through with how to do it so no one got killed.

431
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,000
But Keaton? Keaton put on the finishing touch.

432
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,700
A little "fuck you" from the five of us to the NYPD.

433
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
Watch this.

434
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Careful.

435
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,400
Come on, asshole!

436
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,100
Holy shit!

437
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,200
- Don't move, you fucker! - Drop it now, motherfucker!

438
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,400
Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!

439
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,500
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

440
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,200
- What do you guys want? - Put your fuckin' thing away.

441
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

442
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,000
- Watch the glass! - Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

443
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,400
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby? - Shut up!

444
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,400
Fuck.

445
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,400
'Afternoon, my little pork chops. Give me the shit.

446
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,100
- Don't move! - Give him the shit!

447
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Give him the fuckin' thing!

448
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,100
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

449
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,500
Hurry up! Come on!

450
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,800
- Now the money! - There's no money.

451
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,900
- Give me the money now! - There's no fuckin' money.

452
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
Give him the fuckin' money!

453
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,300
- Do it! Give him the money! - Give me the money!

454
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,800
- Give him the money! - Hurry up!

455
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,800
You know who the fuck I am?

456
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,700
You people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!

457
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,100
We do now, jerk-off.

458
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,200
Cocksucker.

459
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Wait a minute. What's that?

460
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,500
What the fuck?

461
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,400
Holy shit!

462
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,100
Go!

463
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,000
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.

464
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,700
The press was on the scene before the police were.

465
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,200
Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three days later.

466
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,100
Within a few weeks, 50 more cops went down with them.

467
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,100
Everybody got it right in the ass, from the chief on down.

468
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,800
It was beautiful.

469
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
I owe you $2.50.

470
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,500
Dr.Keaton.

471
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,800
- There's more here than I thought. - When's the fence coming?

472
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,800
Redfoot never comes to see me. I always go to see him.

473
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,700
In California?

474
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,600
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I--

475
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,700
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster? No.

476
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,000
- You fuckin' kiddin' me? - So then, who's gonna go?

477
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,100
We all go.

478
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,200
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

479
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,900
My problem, is you and Fenster honeymooning in California...

480
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,000
...while the rest of us are sittin' here holding our dicks.

481
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,700
The job's over.

482
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
Cool it.

483
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,800
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

484
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
You wanna dance?

485
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,700
Ladies.

486
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,500
I would like to propose a toast.

487
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
There you go.

488
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,500
To Mr.Verbal...

489
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
...the man with the plan.

490
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,900
We're gonna miss the flight.

491
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,100
Don't do this. Send her a note. Something.

492
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,700
I said we'll make it.

493
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,700
We're gonna miss the plane.

494
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
She'll understand.

495
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
That's heartwarming. Really.

496
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm weepy.

497
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
You wanna wait outside?

498
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,700
You guys wanted to know what happened. I'm telling you.

499
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,200
Come on, Verbal.

500
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,300
Who do you think you're talkin' to? You expect me to believe that he retired?

501
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,700
For a woman?

502
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,200
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

503
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,900
- He loved her. - Sure.

504
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea.

505
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,300
- It was all Fenster and McManus. - Keaton was a cop for four years.

506
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,200
Who else would know better?

507
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,100
- That job had his name on it. - Edie had him turned around.

508
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
Let me tell you something.

509
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,100
I know Dean Keaton.

510
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,000
I've been investigating him for the past three years.

511
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,600
The guy I know was a cold-blooded bastard.

512
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,200
IAD indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force.

513
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,600
Don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold.

514
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,200
You got him all wrong.

515
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,500
Do I?

516
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,400
Dean Keaton was under indictment seven times while he was on the force.

517
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,000
In every case, witnesses either reversed their testimony...

518
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,000
...or died before they could testify.

519
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,100
When they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in Sing Sing.

520
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,200
He killed three prisoners inside.

521
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,000
Of course, I can't prove this...

522
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,900
...but I can't prove the best part either.

523
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,900
Dean Keaton was dead.

524
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,200
Did you know that?

525
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,200
He died in a fire two years ago, during an investigation into the murder...

526
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,400
...of a witness who was going to testify against him.

527
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,400
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into a warehouse he owned...just before it blew up.

528
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,900
They said he went in to check a leaking gas main.

529
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,700
It blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.

530
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,900
Within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead.

531
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
One killed himself in his car.

532
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,500
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

533
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,700
Let's get this show on the road.

534
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,500
This is not what we discussed. There are too many--

535
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,400
I promise we'll be out before he blows his porch light.

536
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,900
- I have a noon meeting. - Five minutes.

537
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,800
Everyone calm down, all right?

538
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,300
I want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor.

539
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
- He says they were buying-- - Dope. We know.

540
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,700
He doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope.

541
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,100
- People. - What?

542
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,800
He needs guarantees...

543
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,100
- What is he talking about, guarantees? - He says his life is in danger.

544
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,200
He saw the Devil. Looked him in the eye.

545
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,900
- I'm on my way. - No, wait a minute.

546
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,500
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

547
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,000
...about the Devil.

548
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Who's the Devil?

549
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,600
Keyser Soze.

550
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,900
Keyser Soze?

551
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,800
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

552
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
He saw Keyser Soze?

553
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,200
- He saw his face. - All right.

554
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,200
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

555
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,100
Describe him.

556
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,200
Six weeks ago, I get an anonymous phone call...

557
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,300
...telling me I can find Keaton eating at Mondino's, and there he is.

558
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,100
Because he never profited from his alleged death...

559
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,700
...and we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him...

560
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
...we had to let him go.

561
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,600
He was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over.

562
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
And then he had lunch.

563
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,800
I don't know about that.

564
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,600
I don't think you do, but you say you saw Keaton die.

565
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,400
I think you're covering his ass, and he's still out there.

566
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,800
I think he's behind that circus at the harbor.

567
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,400
My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and think he's your friend.

568
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,700
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

569
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,000
I wanna be sure before I go back to New York.

570
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.

571
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,900
What lawyer?

572
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
What lawyer?

573
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,600
Back when I was in that barbershop quartet--

574
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,100
You don't think I know you held out on the DA?

575
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,800
What did you leave out?

576
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,200
I could be on the phone to Ruby in 10 minutes.

577
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,900
- The DA gave me immunity. - Not from me.

578
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,500
You get no immunity from me, you piece of shit.

579
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,100
Every criminal I have put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor...

580
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,800
...every creep and scumbag that walks the street...

581
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,500
...will know the name of Verbal Kint. You talk to me...

582
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,100
...or that precious immunity they grant you...

583
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,500
...won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.

584
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,300
There was a lawyer.

585
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Kobayashi.

586
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,400
- Is he the one that killed Keaton? - No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

587
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,800
Convince me.

588
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,700
Tell me every last detail.

589
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,500
We arrived in Los Angeles and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.

590
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,100
He had a good reputation. Seemed like a good guy.

591
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,400
- Still, we should have known better. - How you doing?

592
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,500
- Good. You? - Not bad. Can't complain.

593
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,300
How's it going, Fenster?

594
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,300
Don't need to open it, right?

595
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,900
You must be Keaton.

596
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,800
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

597
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint. - Verbal, the man with the plan.

598
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,400
You interested in more work?

599
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,200
- We're always looking for extra work. - We're on vacation.

600
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,200
That's too bad.

601
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,800
I got a ton of work and no good people.

602
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
- Not like you guys. - What's the job?

603
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,300
There's this jeweler out of Texas named Saul.

604
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,500
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

605
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,200
He does free appraisals. Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

606
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,000
The word is, he carries around a lot of cash.

607
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,900
So I figure, I keep the merchandise, you keep the green.

608
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,700
- Simple. - What about security?

609
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,100
A couple of bodyguards. Nothing you couldn't handle.

610
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,100
Give me time to check it out?

611
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,600
I expect nothing less from you, man.

612
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Good to see you. We'll call you.

613
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,500
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

614
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,900
A friend in New York tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.

615
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,000
The way I hear it, you did time with ol' Spook.

616
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,900
A good man, wasn't he?

617
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
I used to run dope for him.

618
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,100
Too bad he got shivved.

619
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,300
I shivved him.

620
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,400
Better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later.

621
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,500
I appreciate that.

622
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,400
But just out of curiosity...

623
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,600
...was it business or personal?

624
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,500
A bit of both.

625
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,800
Like I said...

626
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,000
...you give me a call if you're interested.

627
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,900
Is there a problem?

628
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,800
One job.

629
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,900
That was the deal.

630
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,400
One job?

631
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,700
One job?

632
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,300
That's a good one.

633
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,100
Keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is.

634
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,400
He can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself.

635
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,100
It took one day with McManus nagging, and we went back to work.

636
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,300
I get out of my car, and the thing is wrecked.

637
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,900
I look in the backseat of the other car, and this woman's totally naked.

638
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,100
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe. - Get in the car, Saul.

639
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,000
- Freeze, motherfucker! - Stay right there!

640
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,800
There's a second one here, somewhere.

641
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,800
Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!

642
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,400
Give me the fuckin' case. I'm tellin' you for the last time.

643
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,400
Give me the fuckin' case!

644
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,400
- Come on! - Don't move!

645
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,500
Hand over the case.

646
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,700
Hand over the fuckin' case.

647
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,300
Come on, let's go!

648
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,500
- Come on! - Bad day. Fuck it.

649
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,800
Let's go!

650
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,100
Fuck.

651
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,900
- Looks like a lot of china to me. - Shit.

652
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,700
Guys, come on.

653
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,500
- What are you doin'? - I'm gonna kill him.

654
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,700
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

655
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,000
- You gonna kill him? - I'll deal with him.

656
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,900
- You'd better, or I'm gonna. - Shut up.

657
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,700
What am I supposed to do with that?

658
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,200
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain. I don't know what that is.

659
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,300
- What do you mean? - I don't know.

660
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,600
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

661
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,700
Who?

662
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't know. Some limey.

663
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,800
He's a middleman for somebody. He doesn't say, I don't ask.

664
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,100
- You're fuckin' full of shit! - Fuck you.

665
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,900
- Fuck you. - Listen to me.

666
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
We wanna meet him, okay?

667
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,100
That's funny.

668
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,500
He called me last night. He says he wants to meet you guys.

669
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,100
Okay, we'll meet him.

670
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,400
- I'll call you. - Good. Let's go.

671
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,800
I don't like it. Wait a minute. One more thing, tough guy:

672
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,100
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

673
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,500
You're such a tough guy. But do me a favor, all right?

674
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,700
Get the fuck off my dick.

675
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,600
No!

676
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,500
Put a leash on that puppy.

677
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,900
It's an awful shame about Saul gettin' whacked.

678
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,700
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

679
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,400
Sooner or later, they're gonna come around askin' me.

680
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,100
You have a sweet night, ladies.

681
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,200
Fuck you.

682
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,400
- So this lawyer-- - Kobayashi.

683
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,500
- Came from Redfoot. - Right.

684
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,700
And why leave this out when you talked to the DA?

685
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
Dave, someone to see you.

686
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,300
I've been looking all over for you.

687
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,000
You still after that coke that took a walk out of that bloodbath yesterday?

688
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,900
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

689
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,600
I've been in LA County talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe...

690
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,500
...yesterday after the shootout.

691
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,700
He came to this morning, he started talking.

692
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,100
He's part of a Hungarian mob. They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

693
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,700
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

694
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,100
- But there were-- - We know. But he says no on the dope.

695
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,700
This Hungarian tells me they were pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

696
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,300
They had no time for that kind of product, and no means to move it.

697
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
- What's the money for? - He didn't know.

698
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,700
No one doing the deal knew except for a few key people.

699
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,100
They were all very hush about it, he says.

700
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,500
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive. - I don't get it.

701
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,900
You got the cripple in there from New York?

702
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,500
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

703
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,100
Who?

704
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,600
Just bear with me here.

705
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,800
- Who's Keyser Soze? - Fuck!

706
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,000
We've been goin' over this for an hour and a half.

707
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,300
What we need to do is find Redfoot and get the hell out of here now.

708
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
What we need to do is think.

709
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,100
Think back.

710
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,000
Somebody with power...

711
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,700
...somebody capable of tracking us from New York to LA.

712
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,800
- What the hell are we doing here? - We're waiting.

713
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,300
- Sit down. - No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

714
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,100
Mr.Hockney, do stay.

715
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,200
Mr.Keaton.

716
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,900
Mr.Fenster I recognize from his mug shots...

717
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,800
...as well as Mr.McManus.

718
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,900
I can only assume that you are Mr.Kint, the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

719
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,700
My employer sends his gratitude, a most unexpected benefit.

720
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,600
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

721
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,500
I have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

722
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,700
- What do you want? - My employer requires your services.

723
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,400
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

724
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,000
He does not expect all of you to live. But those of you who do...

725
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,200
...will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit.

726
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,000
Who's your boss?

727
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,900
I work for Keyser Soze.

728
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,500
Who's Keyser Soze?

729
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,900
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

730
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,000
...I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.

731
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,100
I come with an offer directly from Mr.Soze.

732
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,100
- An order, actually. - What do you mean, "an order"?

733
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:41,300
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

734
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,500
The cargo was raw steel, steel which belonged to Mr.Soze...

735
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,700
...and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor.

736
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
A most profitable violation of UN Regulations.

737
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,200
You had no way of knowing this...

738
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,400
...because the fellow shipping the steel was working for Soze...

739
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,100
...without his knowledge.

740
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,100
Earlier this year, Mr.Fenster and Mr.McManus...

741
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,900
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.

742
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,300
The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring also set for Pakistan.

743
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,400
Two months ago, Mr.Hockney stole a truck...

744
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,000
...carrying gun parts through Queens.

745
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,700
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of New York.

746
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,700
They were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to Belfast.

747
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Again, Mr.Soze using pawns who had no knowledge.

748
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,300
Which brings us to Mr.Kint.

749
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,000
Nine months ago, one of Mr.Soze's...

750
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,700
...less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam...

751
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,800
...by a cripple.

752
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,500
He was relieved of $62,000.

753
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,200
Now, it has taken us some time to find you.

754
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,500
Our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York.

755
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,000
You set up the lineup.

756
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,400
Yes. You were not to be released until I had come to see you.

757
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,300
It seems Mr.Keaton's attorney, Miss Finneran...

758
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,200
...was a little too effective in expediting his release.

759
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,400
Holding the rest of you became a moot point.

760
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,400
- What about Redfoot? - Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

761
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,200
Mr.Soze rarely works with the same people for long...

762
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,100
...and they never know who they're working for.

763
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,100
One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.

764
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,100
So, why are you telling us?

765
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,700
Because you have stolen from Mr.Soze, Mr.Fenster.

766
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
All of you.

767
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,700
That you did not know it is the only reason you're still alive.

768
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,000
He feels you owe him. You will repay your debt.

769
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,300
Fuck the debt, and fuck you. How do we know you work for Soze?

770
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,300
I don't think that is very relevant.

771
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,700
All five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg...

772
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,100
...and his bodyguards.

773
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,900
Mr.Redfoot can testify to your involvement.

774
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,900
We can see to it that he will.

775
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,100
- What's your point? - The offer is this, gentlemen:

776
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,500
Mr.Soze's primary interest...

777
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,300
...is narcotics.

778
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,700
He has been competing, shall we say...with a group of Argentineans for several years.

779
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,800
Competing with Mr.Soze has taken its toll.

780
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,200
These Argentineans are negotiating the sale...

781
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,100
...of $91 million in cocaine in three days time.

782
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:21,100
Needless to say, this purchase will revitalize...the diminishing strength of their organization.

783
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,200
Mr.Soze would like you to stop the deal.

784
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,100
If you choose, you may wait until after the buy.

785
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,800
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

786
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:37,500
Mr.Soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

787
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,100
And then you will be free of your obligations to Mr.Soze.

788
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,100
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.

789
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,600
A gift from Mr.Soze.

790
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,600
Good day, gentlemen.

791
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,000
They got my whole life in here, everything I've done since I was 18.

792
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,400
They fuckin' know everything.

793
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,300
Everybody I've ever worked with or did time with.

794
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
No.

795
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,300
- This isn't right. - I don't know.

796
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,500
Who's that guy who used to talk about Soze in New York?

797
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,300
- Bricks Marlin. - He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

798
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,700
He said he always made five times more money on it than the job was worth.

799
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,000
This guy's a pipe dream.

800
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,300
Kobayashi's using him for window dressing.

801
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,400
I don't know. This is bad.

802
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,700
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD. It's a fuckin' setup.

803
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,500
The way I hear it, Soze's some kind of butcher.

804
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,100
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher. - There is no Keyser Soze!

805
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,500
Who is Keyser Soze?

806
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,500
He's supposed to be Turkish. Some say his father was German.

807
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Nobody ever believed he was real.

808
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,000
Nobody knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him.

809
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
To hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze.

810
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,400
You never knew. That was his power.

811
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:36,500
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

812
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,600
One story the guys told me, the story I believe

813
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,400
...was from his days in Turkey.

814
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,400
There was a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob.

815
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,900
They realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns...

816
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,500
...or money or even numbers.

817
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,000
You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.

818
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,800
After a while they come into power, and then they come after Soze.

819
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,200
He was small-time then. Just running dope, they say.

820
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,900
They come to his home...in the afternoon looking for his business.

821
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:12,200
They find his wife and kids in the house, and decide to wait for Soze.

822
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,300
He comes home to find his wife raped and children screaming.

823
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,700
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with.

824
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,500
They let him know they meant business.

825
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,200
No!

826
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,500
They tell him they want his territory, all his business.

827
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,400
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

828
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,800
Then he showed these men of will what will really was.

829
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,300
He tells them he would rather see his family dead...

830
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,000
...than live another day after this.

831
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,600
He lets the last Hungarian go...

832
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,800
...waits until his family is in the ground, and goes after the rest of the mob.

833
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,800
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

834
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,200
...he kills their parents and their friends.

835
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,900
He burns down the houses they live in...

836
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,800
...and the stores they work in.

837
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,900
He kills people that owe them money. And like that...

838
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,000
...he's gone, underground.

839
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,700
Nobody's ever seen him since. He becomes a myth.

840
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,900
A spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.

841
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,100
"Rat on your pop, and Keyser Soze will get you."

842
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
No one ever really believes.

843
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,300
Do you believe in him?

844
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,500
Keaton always said:

845
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,200
"I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."

846
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,100
I believe in God.

847
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,500
And the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.

848
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,400
You give any weight to this?

849
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,900
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice.

850
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,600
He's got a file on Soze in DC. It's been a hobby of his for a while.

851
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,100
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.

852
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,600
You've heard of him?

853
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,500
Where? On the street?

854
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,300
A few times. You know, outside stuff.

855
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,600
Someone working for a guy who worked for a guy who got money from Soze.

856
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,300
Shit like that.

857
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,400
It could be an old badge. A hex sign.

858
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,500
Keep people from fucking with you when a name meant something.

859
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,500
- But you're here. - Shit, yeah.

860
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,400
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital because he's so afraid of Soze.

861
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,800
I'll run it up the flagpole.

862
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,700
I came clean. I told it like it happened.

863
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,300
So what about how I got there?

864
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,600
It's so full of holes, the DA would've told me to forget amnesty.

865
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,900
You got what you wanted out of me. Big deal.

866
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,800
- That's why you never told the DA? - You tell me.

867
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,200
If I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me, what would you say?

868
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,600
Turn state's evidence. We'll put you on the stand.

869
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,100
I've got immunity. What can you possibly offer me?

870
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,800
If there really is a Keyser Soze, he's gonna come lookin' for you.

871
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,600
Where's your head?

872
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,000
Where do you think the pressure is?

873
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,200
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him, knows where I am right now.

874
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,500
He has the burner on your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

875
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
Immunity was just a deal with you assholes.

876
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,800
I got a new problem when I post bail.

877
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,300
Why play into his hands? We can protect you.

878
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,700
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion.

879
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,900
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

880
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,300
The same fuckers that rounded us up are now bailing me out?

881
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,100
Fuck you.

882
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,400
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

883
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,200
You think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?

884
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,100
If he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me.

885
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,000
After that...

886
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,400
...my guess is you'll never hear from him again.

887
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,100
What happened next?

888
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,000
We woke up the next morning and Fenster was gone.

889
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,600
He couldn't handle the idea of slumming for Soze.

890
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,800
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

891
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,600
...and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.

892
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:57,800
Then what?

893
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,500
McManus was furious.

894
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,800
He talked about tracking him down and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

895
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,700
That night, we got the call.

896
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,300
What call?

897
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,900
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

898
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,400
Let's get the fuck out of here.

899
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
We gotta bury him.

900
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,000
With what?

901
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,000
With our hands.

902
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,300
This is nuts.

903
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
It's dry fucking sand.

904
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,100
When he rots the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away.

905
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
- Dig, you fuck. - What are we gonna do?

906
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,200
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

907
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,100
I don't know about you, peg leg, but I can run. I got no problem with that.

908
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,200
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.

909
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,900
You run, and we're gonna be diggin' a hole for you.

910
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,500
You got that?

911
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:06,500
This ain't my boy we're burying. I don't owe anybody!

912
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,000
- So fuck you. - He was my partner for five years.

913
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,700
We did more jobs and I saw more money than you can ever count.

914
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,200
So fuck you!

915
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,900
- 'Cause now it's payback! - It's not payback!

916
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,200
It's precaution.

917
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,600
You want payback? You wanna run? I don't care.

918
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,800
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

919
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,500
I'm not doin' it for you.

920
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,900
I'm doin' this for me.

921
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,600
I'm gonna finish this thing.

922
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,500
This Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me.

923
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,800
After they killed Fenster, nobody would run?

924
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,900
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it. - Why didn't you say anything?

925
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,600
Believe me, I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.

926
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,700
It was too far-fetched for him.

927
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,000
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

928
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,000
To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated.

929
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,700
It's always simple.

930
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,400
There's no mystery to the street, no arch-criminal.

931
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,200
You got a body and think his brother did it, you're probably right.

932
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,800
Nobody argued with Keaton.

933
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,500
They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

934
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,800
They're coming up.

935
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,700
- Did you hear me? He's coming up. - He's on his way down.

936
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,800
Don't move.

937
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,200
Press 20. Do it now.

938
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,600
Move.

939
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,900
- The answer is "no." - Mr.Soze will be most--

940
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,200
Listen, cocksucker, there is no Keyser Soze.

941
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:26,800
Mention his name again, I'll kill you right now.

942
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,700
A strange threat. I assume you've come here to kill me anyway.

943
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,600
We know that you can get to us...

944
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,300
...but now you know that we can get to you.

945
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,900
I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.

946
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
My employer has made up his mind.

947
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,600
- He does not change it. - Neither do we.

948
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,600
You got Fenster, but you won't be able to get all of us.

949
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,000
Not before one of us gets through to you.

950
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,200
I believe you. I most sincerely do.

951
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,800
You would not have been chosen were you not so suitable.

952
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,800
But I cannot make this decision. Whatever you threaten me with is...

953
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,700
...ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me...

954
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,400
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

955
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,400
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

956
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,300
I just wanted you to know that.

957
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
I'm so sorry.

958
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,200
I implore you, believe me...

959
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
...Mr.Soze is very real...

960
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,500
- ...and very determined. - We'll see.

961
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,300
Before you do me in...

962
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,700
...you will let me finish my business with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

963
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:01,200
What did you say?

964
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,900
Edie Finneran.

965
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,200
She's upstairs in my office...

966
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,000
...for an extradition deposition.

967
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,800
I requested she be put on the case personally.

968
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,700
She flew in yesterday.

969
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,000
No matter.

970
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,400
Kill away.

971
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,700
You're lying.

972
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,300
Am I?

973
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,400
Miss Finneran's escort while she's here in Los Angeles.

974
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,100
Never leaves her for a moment.

975
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,000
I thought you'd be glad to know she's in good hands.

976
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,600
Get some rest. The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

977
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,300
If I see you or any of your friends before then...

978
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,200
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies.

979
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,800
As indeed will your father, Mr.Hockney...

980
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,200
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr.Kint.

981
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,600
I might only castrate Mr.McManus' nephew, David.

982
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,500
Do I make myself clear?

983
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,400
We will take care of the two bodies downstairs.

984
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,700
We'll add them to the cost of Mr.Fenster.

985
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,800
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

986
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,100
It's a logistical nightmare.

987
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,000
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

988
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,600
There's no tellin' how many more are gonna be below deck.

989
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,900
Can we stealth these guys?

990
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,500
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

991
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,700
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

992
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,900
Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

993
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,700
What if we wait for the money?

994
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,000
Ten more men at least.

995
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,600
In my opinion, it can't be done.

996
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,200
Anyone who goes in is not comin' out alive.

997
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,300
- I'm gonna wait for the money. - Me, too.

998
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,800
- Did you hear what he just said? - If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

999
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,100
Me, too.

1000
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,600
There's nothing that can't be done.

1001
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,400
I just can't believe we're gonna walk in to certain death.

1002
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,200
The news said it's raining in New York.

1003
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,500
What language is that?

1004
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,900
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1005
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,100
Hungarian?

1006
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,800
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1007
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,900
You kids ready?

1008
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,500
I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.

1009
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,900
I'm ready.

1010
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,000
McManus, you better be set up in 10 seconds.

1011
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,100
I'm ready.

1012
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,200
I want you to stay here.

1013
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,900
I'm supposed to cover--

1014
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,800
If we don't get out of this, take the money and go.

1015
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,000
I can't--

1016
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,400
Find Edie. Tell her everything that happened.

1017
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1018
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,600
If I don't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.

1019
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,200
- What if I-- - Just do what I say.

1020
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,100
Please.

1021
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,000
Tell her that...

1022
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,200
Tell her I tried.

1023
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,900
McManus, he's on his way.

1024
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,600
I'm there.

1025
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,600
One, two, three, four...

1026
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,800
...five, six, seven...

1027
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,900
Oswald was a fag.

1028
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,400
Hi.

1029
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,600
How you doin'?

1030
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,800
Is there a problem?

1031
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,300
Now.

1032
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:27,800
"Old McDonald had a farm

1033
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,400
"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O

1034
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,300
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

1035
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,500
Elvis has left the building.

1036
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,400
Hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!

1037
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,300
Hello.

1038
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,000
Why didn't you run?

1039
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,200
I froze up.

1040
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,300
I thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him.

1041
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,500
Then I thought about Keaton, and it looked like he might pull it off.

1042
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,900
A boy found a body on the beach today.

1043
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,400
Thrown clear of the boat. Shot twice in the head.

1044
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,400
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

1045
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,600
- What else? - His name was Arturo Marquez.

1046
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,600
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1047
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,500
He was arrested last year in New York for trafficking.

1048
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,400
He escapes to California. They pick him up in Long Beach.

1049
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,800
They're setting up extradition, he escapes again.

1050
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,200
Now, get this.

1051
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,900
Edie Finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings.

1052
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,300
Kobayashi

1053
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,500
New York faxed me a copy of his testimony.

1054
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,200
- He was a rat. - A big fucking rat.

1055
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,000
Arturo was very opposed to returning to prison.

1056
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,000
So much so, that he named close to 50 people.

1057
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,500
Guess who he named in the finale.

1058
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,900
Keyser Soze

1059
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,600
There's more.

1060
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,300
I'll tell you what I know. Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1061
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,900
There was no dope on that boat.

1062
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,100
You, stay quiet.

1063
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,600
He's here.

1064
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:47,000
I know he's here. That's him. I'm telling you, that's him.

1065
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,800
I know he's here!

1066
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,500
- You can't understand. That's him. - Shut up.

1067
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,000
That's him. You hear me? I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1068
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,200
- Where's Hockney? - I don't know.

1069
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,900
There's no coke.

1070
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,000
- What? - You heard me, dumb fuck.

1071
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,400
- There's no coke! - What the fuck? No coke?

1072
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,100
I've been up and down in every fucking room.

1073
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,400
- There's gotta be coke! - There is nothing!

1074
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,700
Nothing!

1075
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,700
Don't you fuck with me.

1076
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,700
There is no fucking coke!

1077
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,400
I'm out of here.

1078
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,100
I told them nothing.

1079
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,400
I swear.

1080
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,700
I told them nothing. Please.

1081
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,900
What the fuck is goin' on?

1082
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,400
The strangest thing.

1083
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,300
That's what you said. You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1084
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,900
Wait a minute.

1085
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1086
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:16,600
- You said you didn't know who it was. - I know there was dope on that boat.

1087
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,200
- Stop stallin'. - I'm not.

1088
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,900
- You know what I'm getting at. - Get out of my face.

1089
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,800
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.

1090
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,600
You know what I'm getting at.

1091
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,200
- I don't know what you're talking about. - The truth!

1092
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,400
Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.

1093
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,500
I did.

1094
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,000
You're lying to me.

1095
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:36,500
- You've known this whole time. - I don't know what you're saying.

1096
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:39,200
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.

1097
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,900
Why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1098
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,900
He was your friend.

1099
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,600
Because I was afraid.

1100
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,400
- Afraid. - Afraid of what?

1101
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,700
- Afraid of-- - I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1102
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,900
It was Keyser Soze, I mean, the Devil himself.

1103
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,800
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1104
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,000
What if you miss?

1105
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,600
Let's get back to the pier.

1106
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,800
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him? - What? No.

1107
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,600
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department.

1108
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:51,000
He swore out a statement to federal marshals...

1109
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:54,500
...saying that he had seen and could positively identify one...

1110
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:55,800
...Keyser Soze

1111
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,100
It says right here in the report.

1112
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,900
He had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including...

1113
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,200
...but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.

1114
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,800
I never heard of him.

1115
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,700
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians.

1116
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,400
Most likely the same Hungarians that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1117
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,400
The money wasn't there for dope.

1118
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,800
The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy...

1119
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,000
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1120
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,900
- I said I never heard of him. - But Keaton did.

1121
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition advisor.

1122
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,300
She knew who he was and what he knew.

1123
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,800
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit.

1124
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,500
A suicide mission to whack out the one guy...

1125
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,700
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1126
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,900
So Soze put some thieves to it...

1127
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,700
...men he knew he could march into certain death.

1128
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,500
You're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?

1129
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,800
I'm saying Keaton did. He left you behind for a reason.

1130
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,400
Just do what I tell you.

1131
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,700
If you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere...

1132
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,700
...why did he give you the money to run?

1133
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,100
- He could have used you on the boat. - He wanted me to live.

1134
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,400
A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world...

1135
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,800
...finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple?

1136
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,300
No, sir. Why?

1137
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,100
Edie.

1138
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,800
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.

1139
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,200
Even if I did...

1140
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:16,900
...I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her.

1141
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,400
So why?

1142
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,700
Because he was my friend.

1143
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,700
No, he wasn't your friend. Keaton didn't have friends.

1144
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,200
What are you doing here?

1145
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:31,000
He saved you because he wanted it that way.

1146
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,200
It was his will.

1147
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,500
- Keaton was Keyser Soze. - No.

1148
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:39,100
A man who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus.

1149
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:44,500
A man who could engineer a police lineup...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1150
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,100
The kind of man who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1151
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,000
She was found yesterday at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

1152
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,900
...shot twice in the head.

1153
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,700
What do you think about Keaton now?

1154
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Edie?

1155
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,300
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1156
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,700
He couldn't get on alone. He had to pull the trigger himself...

1157
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,700
...to make sure he got his man...

1158
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,900
...the one man that could identify him.

1159
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,600
This is all bullshit.

1160
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,800
You said you saw him die.

1161
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,200
Or did you?

1162
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,800
You had to hide when you heard the police cars.

1163
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,300
You said you heard the shot before the fire...

1164
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,700
...but you didn't see him die.

1165
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,800
- I knew him. He would never-- - He programmed you.

1166
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:38,500
He programmed you to tell us what he wanted you to.

1167
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,800
He knew we were close. You said it yourself.

1168
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,900
Where was the political pressure to protect you from?

1169
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,200
It was Keaton.

1170
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,600
- Immunity was your reward. - But why me?

1171
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,300
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1172
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,100
Why me? I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?

1173
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:55,600
Because you're a cripple.

1174
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,800
Because you're stupid.

1175
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,000
Because you're weaker than them.

1176
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,600
If he's dead...

1177
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:10,000
If what you say is true, then it won't matter.

1178
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,400
It was his idea to hit the taxi service, wasn't it?

1179
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,600
- Come on, tell me the truth. - It was all Keaton.

1180
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:21,500
We followed him from the beginning.

1181
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,400
I didn't know.

1182
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,600
I saw him die.

1183
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:30,500
I believe he's dead. Christ.

1184
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,500
You're not safe on your own.

1185
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,800
You think he's...

1186
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,700
Keyser Soze?

1187
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,200
I don't know.

1188
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:48,600
Keyser Soze's a shield, or like you said, a spook story.

1189
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:53,300
But I know Keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you.

1190
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:57,500
- Stay here and let us protect you. - I'm not bait. I post today.

1191
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,200
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1192
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,900
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

1193
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,100
- Unless you turn state's. - I'll take my chances.

1194
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,100
If someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there.

1195
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,600
Turn state's evidence. You might never see trial.

1196
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,900
Maybe so.

1197
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,400
But I'm not a rat.

1198
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,700
Fuckin' cops.

1199
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,800
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1200
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,400
You'll have to sign for these, Mr.Kint.

1201
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,200
One watch, gold.

1202
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,800
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1203
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,600
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1204
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:21,300
We still got nothing.

1205
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,900
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.

1206
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,600
Which is nothing.

1207
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,600
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.

1208
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,700
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1209
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:36,000
...if Keaton is alive, he's not comin' up again.

1210
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,300
I'll find him.

1211
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:40,200
Waste of time.

1212
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,400
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1213
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,000
What?

1214
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,100
Nothing.

1215
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,900
Man, you're a slob.

1216
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,300
But it all has a system.

1217
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:00,600
It all makes sense if you look at it right. You gotta stand back from it.

1218
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:05,000
You wanna see a real horror show? See my garage.

1219
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,400
Convince me. Tell me every last...

1220
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:47,500
When I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

1221
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,100
- Where's your head? - We need to think, think back.

1222
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,800
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.

1223
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,500
- Bricks Marlin. - This isn't right.

1224
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,000
- I just wanna hear your story. - It's all there.

1225
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:00,500
- I'm tellin' it straight. - Some guy in California called Redfoot.

1226
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,100
- A gift from Mr.Soze. - Talk to me.

1227
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,200
- What about Redfoot? - Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

1228
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,300
- Using pawns... - A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.

1229
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,100
There was a lawyer...

1230
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,800
Kobayashi...

1231
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:16,400
When I was picking beans in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.

1232
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,500
- I know you thought he was a good man. - I know he was good.

1233
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,800
- You tell me every last detail. - The strangest thing.

1234
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,800
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1235
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,100
This guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of...

1236
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,500
What's your story, pretzel man?

1237
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,400
- There was a lawyer. - What lawyer?

1238
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,600
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

1239
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:39,200
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi. - Tell me every last detail.

1240
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:42,500
- I work for Keyser Soze. - Convince me. Convince me.

1241
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,400
Every creep and scumbag that works the street...

1242
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,600
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1243
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,700
The cripple, did you see him?

1244
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,900
- The cripple! Which way did he go? - He went out that way.

1245
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,600
I know you know something. I know you're not telling...

1246
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:11,800
I'm smarter than you...

1247
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:14,400
...and I'm gonna find out whether you like it or not.

1248
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,400
To a cop, the explanation is never complicated.

1249
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,000
- It's always simple. - The truth!

1250
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:21,000
There's no arch-criminal behind it all.

1251
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,900
Somebody with power, somebody who is capable...

1252
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,700
Keyser Soze!

1253
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:31,900
You think a guy like that gets this close to getting caught...and sticks his head out?

1254
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,800
Because you're stupid. Because you're a cripple.

1255
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:38,000
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?

1256
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,500
You've known the whole fuckin' time.

1257
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,200
If he comes up for anything it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.

1258
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,200
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1259
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,800
First thing I learned on the job. You know what?

1260
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:53,400
- How to spot a murderer. - You got the cripple in there?

1261
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,200
