1
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:41,600
Oh, boy.

2
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,533
Fuck! Stop hitting me!

3
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,833
This is like if Tyson
fought an infant.

4
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,933
Ooh!

5
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,667
I can't wait to punch you in the face while you're sleeping tonight.

6
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,300
Get up! Get up!

7
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:39,833
- Saved by the bell.
- Come on, let me get in a bong hit before round two.

8
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,500
Oh! Look at that ass.

9
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,800
Hey! Hey!
I spilled the bong! Stop!

10
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,700
Boom! Knocked you out!
Eat it, whore!

11
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,967
You cheated, you dick.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,900
No, I didn't.
Oh! The bong water reeks.

13
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:08,100
Yeah, maybe if you cleaned it,
it wouldn't smell like your girlfriend's ass.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,967
What's going on, fellas?

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,267
What's up?
How's it going?

16
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,833
Um, who are you and why
are you in my kitchen?

17
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:25,233
Oh, your landlord, he, uh,
hired us to pick up your stuff.

18
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:27,300
This is bullshit!

19
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,100
It's like Cypress Hill
concert in here.

20
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,133
I don't rent to
those kind of people.

21
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:36,000
Yuri, what the hell's
going on?

22
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,133
Alex, how are you?
I'm good.

23
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:44,167
Hmm. Well, for last six months,
you no pay me rent.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,900
So now,
I no longer let you stay here. Okay?

25
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,400
All right, my friends,
pack up everything, put on truck, okay?

26
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,600
No, no. That's impossible.
We've never missed a payment.

27
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,300
Every month, I give Josh
hundreds of dollars of my money,

28
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,167
and then he writes you
a rent check, right, Josh?

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,000
I love them so much.

30
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,167
You love who?

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,667
The girls at Madame Kamay's
Filipino Palace.

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,333
You've been spending our rent money on Filipino hookers?

33
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:15,100
They're not hookers.
They're massage therapists.

34
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,000
They'll massage
your cock for money.

35
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,000
- There's a word for that. I think it's "hooker."
- You're a hooker!

36
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,300
Whoa, wait.

37
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,700
Listen, Alex, I make you
special deal, huh?

38
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:29,333
I give you five minutes to pack up all
your shit you don't want thrown away.

39
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:33,567
And if you take one extra minute,
I have my two friends,

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,200
they take your testicles and remove them through your anus.

41
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,400
Deal?
Nice man.

42
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:46,200
Okay, they got one minute
and then you-- Okay?

43
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,733
I'm sorry, Alex.
I-I should have told you.

44
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,267
You can't whack it to Internet porn like everyone else?

45
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
You know I don't have
a credit card.

46
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,167
So where you going?

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,700
I'll go to Dante's and see if he'll let me stay there.
What about you?

48
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,000
Madame Kamay said
I could stay at the Palace.

49
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:07,067
You're sick.
I know.

50
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,633
Where's the bong?
Alex!

51
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,767
You forgot smoking lamp.

52
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:19,833
I'm sorry.
Was that expensive piece?

53
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,300
That's your fault too.

54
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,633
* Just another day
Just another day *

55
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:32,733
Yo, Dante, pick up.
Josh is killing me.

56
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:36,267
Where are you?
I'm sick of talking to your machine.

57
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,700
Why aren't you home?
I need you.

58
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:42,700
* Just another day
Just another day *

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,800
* Just another day Just another day ** Hey, Alex.

60
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,700
Don't you answer your phone?
I've been calling for half an hour.

61
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was putting up my Christmas tree.

62
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:58,333
Dude, it's July.

63
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:01,767
Get the fuck out of here.
It is? Yeah. And, uh,

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,467
why are you naked?

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,867
Oh, my God.
I am naked! Come on in!

66
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,133
Dude, your ass is
tanner than my face.

67
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,333
* For my mental
'Cause I'm spinning **

68
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,900
That is pure
fucking insanity.

69
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:21,067
Yeah. I know.
He got addicted to hookers.

70
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,567
No, I'm talking about
the guy who threw your bong.

71
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,300
You should never
throw a bong, kid. Ever.

72
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:31,933
Yeah, well, anyway,
I was wondering if maybe I could crash here for a while.

73
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,633
Whoa. I don't know, man.
I got a business to run.

74
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,900
This is like my office
as well as my home.

75
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,433
Plus, the lion comes
in a couple days.

76
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:43,800
You're getting a lion?
Yeah.

77
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,700
- Why?
- To protect my shit.

78
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:49,133
Never heard of a dog?

79
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:53,500
Dude, you can get past a dog.
Nobody fucks with a lion.

80
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,333
Yeah, that's true.

81
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,533
So what kind of weed
do you want?

82
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:03,100
I got the Incredible Hulk,
I got some of the green monster, I got the bling.

83
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,767
Hey! We go through this
every time I come here.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,133
I don't care what it's called.
I just want a bag of fucking weed.

85
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:13,133
Whoa. Chill, bro.
You know you can't raise your voice like that when the lion's here.

86
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:16,400
Yeah. You know what?
I got to bail or I'm going to miss my cousin's wedding.

87
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,500
You look like
a bag of shit.

88
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,433
You sure you don't wanna borrow
my birthday suit?

89
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:24,000
Thanks anyway,
but brown's not my color.

90
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:27,733
This isn't brown.
I'm bronzed.

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,867
So you can't kill the demon
at the end of Level 6?

92
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,067
Do you have
the magic arrows?

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,367
Easy. Here's what you do.
Hide behind the boulder.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,700
When the demon comes out of the cave,
shoot him three times with the magic arrows.

95
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,700
Then his head will start to spin.
Once that happens,

96
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:50,867
you jump up on the boulder,
you do a flying downward thrust...

97
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,933
with the Sword of Doom
and that's it.

98
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:55,700
Level 6 is done.
Thank you.

99
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,833
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

100
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:02,000
Have I told you today how much I love you?
Mmm. Hey, Grandma.

101
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,567
Hi, honey.
Ooh. You look hot.

102
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,133
Well, I haven't been
out and about for a while,

103
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,133
so I thought
I'd step it up a notch.

104
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:13,767
Well, it worked. Good.
Oh, your father tells me that you need a place to stay.

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,467
Yeah. Just so you know,
Sophie left us two weeks ago.

106
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,867
So her room is available
if you need it.

107
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,167
Oh, where'd Sophie move to?
Heaven.

108
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Ooh. Sorry.
Uh, Sophie was so--

109
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,767
Mean and full of hate.
Yeah.

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,567
So you want to move in tonight?
You know what? That's a really sweet offer,

111
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,733
but unfortunately,
I promised my friend Jeff I'd stay at his house.

112
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:59,567
Come in. Hurry up.
You sure this is okay?

113
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,033
Yeah. It's totally cool. Just keep your voice down.
My roommates are sleeping.

114
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,433
You mean your parents?
Yeah, same thing.

115
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:10,033
Nice jammies. Thanks.
They're a present from my roommates.

116
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,233
That's cool.

117
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,333
Here we go.

118
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,133
Um, where am I supposed to sleep?
On the air mattress.

119
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,933
Do you need a stuffed animal?
I have a dog. I think I have a bear.

120
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,067
Yeah, I have a bear.

121
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,700
- What are you, eight?
- At least I have my own bed.

122
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:42,400
- Your bed is a car.
- Yeah, but it's a fucking sweet car.

123
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,900
My roommates said they are gonna get me rims for Christmas.

124
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:48,867
Or a C.B. radio.
I can talk to other car beds. That'll be hot.

125
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,000
Might get a stereo too.

126
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,300
My sister said I should get an alarm.
Shut up.

127
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,233
Gross.

128
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,233
Oh, yeah.

129
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:47,267
Come on, Lara.
My cock is lost in the jungle and it's up for you to find it.

130
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,800
Oh, Lara, you dirty,
dirty adventurer.

131
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,233
Come on.
Let's go exploring.

132
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,433
Why don't you explore
my underwear, baby?

133
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,267
Damn, you look good.

134
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,167
What's under
the skirt, Lara?

135
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh, let's see. Huh?

136
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:07,633
Ooh, Lara, no panties?
How'd you know I liked it like that?

137
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,567
Oh, yeah. Okay.

138
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,433
Ooh, here we go. All right.
Here we go. Jeffrey?

139
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,767
- What are you doing up so--
- Oh! Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

140
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,367
I can't stop coming!
I'm sorry! It feels so good!

141
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,800
I can't believe
you came on my mom.

142
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,267
You might be the biggest perv in the world right now.
What were you thinking?

143
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,367
I couldn't sleep.
I saw the doll.

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,067
So you can't wake me up to play video games or something?

145
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,800
Didn't want to disturb you.
You were balls deep in that turtle with a thumb in your mouth.

146
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,733
I love my turtle.

147
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,933
Anyway, my mom said you could still stay the night.

148
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:49,667
Oh, yeah, that's not
an awkward breakfast.

149
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,033
Tell her thanks.
I'm just going to go crash at the office.

150
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:56,933
All right, suit yourself.
I'll see you in a couple hours. Yeah.

151
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,700
You can keep the doll,
by the way.

152
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,267
Oh, I was planning on that.

153
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,067
Oh! My doll is a whore.

154
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,467
* I wasn't laughing properly *

155
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,233
* When you were talking to me *

156
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:34,000
* I didn't find it funny *

157
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,600
* Your story didn't
do it for me **

158
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,967
Uh, excuse me?

159
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:54,600
Hi.

160
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:58,800
Good morning.
Um, I'm just looking for my office.

161
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,367
Are you the new janitor?

162
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,267
No, I'm, uh,
Samantha Garson.

163
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,133
I'm here to oversee the final stages of
production on "Eternal Death Slayer 3."

164
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,733
Oh, hi. I didn't know
anyone new was coming in.

165
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm Alex. I'm one of the testers.
Do you usually sleep here?

166
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:20,433
No. I was working late.
I love work. I love life.

167
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,400
That's good to know.

168
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:27,233
Yeah, um,
your office is probably the empty one down the hall.

169
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:30,067
Thank you.
Alex, there's-- Yeah?

170
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,600
Brush your teeth.
I'll see you later.

171
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,733
Thank you.

172
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,200
Yeah.

173
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,100
Johnny.

174
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,333
Who the fuck is Johnny?

175
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:07,833
* He went so far *

176
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:11,033
* Across the floor **

177
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,233
What's up, Douche Bigalow?
How'd you sleep last night?

178
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:17,567
Fine, Speed Racer.
What did you do, valet your bed?

179
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,500
Uh, no,
but I'll self-park it in your asshole.

180
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:24,300
Come on. Let's go to lunch.
Hey, you remember Lara, don't you?

181
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,967
Yes, I do, and she already has a cold sore.
That's a surprise.

182
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:35,267
Hey, word on the street is Mr.
Cheezle brought some girl here from New York...

183
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,500
to make sure we finish
"Eternal Death Slayer" on time.

184
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:42,233
Yeah, her name's Samantha.
She's really hot. She wants to bang me.

185
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm sure she does.
Are you ready? Oh, please.

186
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,433
Line up, you fucking nerds.
Who wants a shot at the champ?

187
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,367
Who's going down?

188
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,933
I'm taking the title,
old man.

189
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:59,400
The game...
is Frog Bog.

190
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,333
Let's do it.

191
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,633
Om.

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,467
Om.

193
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,400
- Tea?
- Sure.

194
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:25,400
It's a wonderful
dandelion-nettle blend.

195
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:29,033
Very cleansing.
Good for new beginnings.

196
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:37,400
So, Samantha, as you know,
our immediate focus...

197
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:40,167
is the completion of "Eternal Death Slayer 3" in time for the fall.

198
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,100
We've had an enormous amount of bugs at this stage, and,
quite frankly,

199
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,733
I'm a little more
than concerned.

200
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:50,667
"Knife Head IV" was in a similar situation,
but we met the deadline.

201
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,200
"Jump Rope City" was a total nightmare,
and we figured it out.

202
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,233
That's why I brought you in.

203
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:58,367
To complete
E.D.S. 3 on schedule...

204
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,367
so we can free up all the testers for J.P.'s new masterpiece.

205
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,600
Two major titles in one year?

206
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,567
And he's programming and designing them all by himself?

207
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,033
- He must be a genius.
- Well, J.P. is not normal.

208
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,833
He created the original "Eternal Death Slayer" when he was only 13.

209
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,767
He's the definition
of a prodigy.

210
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,767
- J.P.
- Sorry I'm late, Mr. Cheezle.

211
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,000
I was in the middle of another huge breakthrough with the new game.

212
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,267
- How's it looking?
- It's the future of gaming.

213
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,267
Breathtaking.
Care for tea?

214
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,300
No, I'm good.
Uh, I don't believe that we've met.

215
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,500
Oh, this is
Samantha Garson.

216
00:15:46,533 --> 00:15:50,067
I brought her in from New York to, uh,
be the project manager on E.D.S. 3.

217
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,000
Hi. It's nice to finally meet you.
You have quite a reputation.

218
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:57,500
Everything you've
heard about me is true.

219
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:02,300
So, uh, if you ever need anything,
just please, feel free to call.

220
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,667
I'll give you all my numbers.
Thanks, I will.

221
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,633
Seriously,
anything you need.

222
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,633
Say, J.P., why don't you show Samantha around the office,
introduce her to everyone.

223
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:14,467
Sure. I cou-- Yeah.
I'll put my genius on hold for a while.

224
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,833
After you, my lady.

225
00:16:18,867 --> 00:16:21,467
Namaste, you guys.

226
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Did the kids in school hound you
for "Eternal Death Slayer" tips?

227
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:28,833
School.
I didn't need school.

228
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:32,733
All I ever cared about were video games,
and they've made me a millionaire.

229
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,567
So maybe I don't know
what the Civil War was...

230
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,400
or who invented the helicopter,
even though I own one.

231
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,733
But I did beat "The Legend of Zelda" before I could walk.

232
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,800
That's cool.
Yeah.

233
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,767
I'm thinking of getting metal legs.
It's a risky operation, but it'll be worth it.

234
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
What's in here?

235
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,667
It's just the kids
in their break room.

236
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Or as I call it,
"The Stupid Idiot Room Full of Jerks."

237
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,967
Mine's the biggest office--
Let's check it out.

238
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,833
Let's go! You suck!
You suck!

239
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,067
I thought you were
good at this, man.

240
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,500
Oh, flies. I'm a frog. I'm eating flies.
A lot more than you.

241
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:23,100
Eat that frog dick, Timmy!
Eat it!

242
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry you
had to see this.

243
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:29,067
It's all these poor knaves have to look forward to every day.

244
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,533
Yeah! Your shit's weak!
Shit's weak!

245
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:37,367
Whoa! Yeah! Yeah!

246
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Your shit's weak!
Wizzeak!

247
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:44,333
You never had a chance, Timmy.
I'll get you eventually, gray bush. Time is on my side.

248
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:46,833
Hey, at least
I have a bush.

249
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:51,300
Shit's weak! Oh, hey, Samantha.
Sorry you had to hear that.

250
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,267
No. Congratulations
on having a bush.

251
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,167
How do you two
know each other?

252
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,233
I woke him up here this morning.
He fell asleep working late last night.

253
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:03,433
Yeah, well, that's what old people do.
They fall asleep.

254
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:07,067
Wow, J.P., that is
a great outfit.

255
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,033
How much do clothes cost
in the Matrix?

256
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:14,400
So funny I forgot to laugh.

257
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,567
Hi, I'm Jeff. I have a bush too.
It's not gray.

258
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,667
Hey!
What?

259
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,633
My bush isn't
really gray.

260
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,200
Not according to my mom.
I thought I told you to quit talking about that.

261
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,633
People keep asking me about it.
Um--

262
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm really sorry to have to leave this conversation,
but I will see you guys later.

263
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,400
Get back to work,
testers.

264
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:35,833
Hey, Samantha,
don't take the red pill!

265
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,533
Adios, turd nuggets.

266
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,167
Wow.

267
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:08,933
Hey, Timmy, any chance I can
crash on your couch tonight?

268
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,967
Why? So you can
jerk off on my mom?

269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,933
Jeff's a fucking liar,
Timmy!

270
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,967
What's that?

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,500
How many people did you tell about the incident with me and your mom?

272
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:25,200
Thirteen, maybe. Why?
I didn't know it was a secret.

273
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:28,067
No, you're right.
Your mom would really appreciate it.

274
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:33,533
My bad. Sorry.
It's all right.

275
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,867
So where are you going to
crash tonight?

276
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,467
Um, this,
uh-- this really cute chick I've known for a long time...

277
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,133
said that I could sleep over with her and her two crazy girlfriends.

278
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,967
No way!
Yep.

279
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
Three chicks and you?

280
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,433
Yeah.
I'll call you later and let you know which bed I end up in.

281
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:53,067
Totally. Oh, my roommate's here.
Later, 'gator. Later.

282
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,100
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mommy.

283
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,833
Did you have a good day? I did.
Did you remember to TiVo Samurai Jack?

284
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,433
I did.

285
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:18,367
Oh, honey, they work you
too hard there.

286
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,600
That's a long day.
It's not that tough of a job, though, Grandma. But thank you.

287
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:27,533
You are something else.
You must be starving, darling.

288
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,467
Yeah, I could eat.

289
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,800
That's, uh, quite the buffet
you have there.

290
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,967
Thank you,
Mr. President.

291
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:43,133
Oh, Grace, you remember
my grandson Alex.

292
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,333
Our new roommate.

293
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,200
How long you staying?
Um, just till I find a new apartment.

294
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,667
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

295
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,600
- How old are you now?
- I'll be 36 in October.

296
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,467
My grandson's gay too.
I'll give you his number.

297
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,100
I'm not gay,
but thank you. Denial.

298
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,467
Wow. That Grace sure makes me
feel warm and welcome.

299
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,933
Well, you'd be bitter too if you had four husbands die on you.

300
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:17,133
Probably suicides.

301
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:21,033
I was just kidding. There we go.
Here's your din-din.

302
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,100
Oh, watch-- It's hot.
Ooh, be careful--

303
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,633
Okay, so that's chicken cutlet,
leftover lasagna...

304
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,867
some scrambled eggs,

305
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,700
some pudding and--
and, oh, wait a minute.

306
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,800
A piece of
the wedding cake.

307
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:39,300
- That is awesome, Grandma. Thank you.
- Ah, you're welcome.

308
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,333
Here's your new room, baby.

309
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,567
Wow, Grandma,
this is nice. Oh, good.

310
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:55,167
Hey, uh, Sophie didn't
die in the bed, did she?

311
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,233
Oh, no.
Good, good, good.

312
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:00,267
No. She fell out of bed and died right here.
Ew!

313
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,200
Oh, I am so happy
that you're here, honey.

314
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,100
Thank you so much, again.
Sweet dreams, darling.

315
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,333
Oh, thanks.
Okay.

316
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:14,500
- See you in the morning.
- You sure will.

317
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,433
Ew.

318
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:40,800
I died on the floor,

319
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,467
and nobody helped me.

320
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,467
You have got to be
fucking shitting me.

321
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,133
Oh, it's so cold
when you're dead.

322
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,033
I swear to God I would
have helped you, Sophie.

323
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:58,300
Please don't kill me.
I would have helped you. I just wasn't here--

324
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,900
- Gotcha!
- Oh, my God!

325
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,433
- You scaredy-cat.
- What the hell are you doing, Grandma?

326
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,800
Well, I told you we were
going to have fun.

327
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,567
Yeah.
Sweetie?

328
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,567
Uh-huh? Don't curse.
You're better than that.

329
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,533
Okay. Fuck!

330
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,400
That's fucking crazy.

331
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:31,233
Oh, God.
What is happening?

332
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:34,067
What the--

333
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:39,067
What? Come on.
Stop that.

334
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,500
Why are you doing
this to me?

335
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:47,300
Thank you. Thank you.

336
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:49,800
Thank you.
Thank you.

337
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:53,300
Oh, rise and shine.

338
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,733
Go take a tinkle and be sure to wash your hands,

339
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,733
- then come down and have breakfast.
- Okay, Grandma.

340
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:09,867
Wow! That was
a great breakfast.

341
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,167
Grandma, I'm going to go
back to sleep now.

342
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,067
Oh. Well, don't you
have to go to work?

343
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,867
Actually, I don't have to be at work for another three and a half hours.

344
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,133
Oh, that's wonderful that you have all this extra time,

345
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,900
because we really could use
your help around the house.

346
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:25,133
Oh, not a problem.
What do you need me to do?

347
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:28,833
Mmm, just a few chores.

348
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,900
* I don't need to need you *

349
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:34,033
* Tell me what to do *

350
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:37,067
* Tell me what to say *

351
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,033
* Don't you wanna help me *

352
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:42,600
* Tell me what to do *

353
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:46,033
* Help me find the way *
Here you go, honey.

354
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:50,433
* Hopefully
You make no mistake *

355
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:54,500
* If you learn from what
you've got to take *

356
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:59,400
* Good or bad
It's all gonna add up *

357
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:03,067
* In the end
But you can never win *

358
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,800
* Don't need to need you *
* Don't tell me how *

359
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,167
All right, you guys,
I'm gonna need you to go all the way back...

360
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,367
and recheck,
starting with Level 1, okay?

361
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,067
Kane, you are gonna
take 1 through 3.

362
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,567
- Whatever you need, Samantha.
- Barry, you'll cover 4 through 6.

363
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,300
Yeah, I can do that.
No problem. You're great.

364
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,300
Jeff, you're already working on 7 through 9,
so why don't you just stick with those.

365
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,300
Let's do it.

366
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:44,767
The levels, I mean.
Not sex.

367
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,267
Sorry.
All right.

368
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,000
Alex, I need you to
deal with 10 through 15,

369
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:53,100
because those are
the real problem levels and--

370
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:56,267
Is he sleeping?

371
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Yes, and possibly
shitting his pants.

372
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,900
Wake up, dude.

373
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:03,367
No chores, Grandma!

374
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,467
Nice rip, Alex.

375
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,233
Rip what?

376
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,433
All right, you guys. Come on.
Get to work. It's crunch time.

377
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:14,567
Seriously, rip what?
Why are you so tired?

378
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,033
Uh, maybe 'cause I was
with three chicks last night.

379
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:19,533
Something you'd know
nothing about.

380
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:23,900
Excuse you. Hey, look,
it's Bono's brother.

381
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:26,267
So how'd the loser
conference go?

382
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,400
Those losers are gonna make sure
your game releases on time.

383
00:26:29,433 --> 00:26:32,567
Oh, no, of course.
Uh, they're-- they're the best.

384
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:37,800
I want to get you
a black cobra.

385
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:40,167
Just to go
around the neck.

386
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,600
J.P., I got to stay
on top of these guys.

387
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,733
Please get on top of me.

388
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,033
Here, honey, I made you
some Jell-O with no fruit...

389
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,967
'cause I know how
much you hate it.

390
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,133
And you got cheese and crackers and
some chocolate milk to wash it all down.

391
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,567
That's great. Thank you.
Oh, what's this?

392
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,767
Mmm, this is a video game
I'm making.

393
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,333
It's kind of like a side project.
Oh, good for you, honey.

394
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:20,833
- Hey, you want to play it?
- Well, I don't know.

395
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,967
Okay.

396
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,200
You are so talented.

397
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:29,900
I remember the birdhouse you
made way back at grade school.

398
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:34,067
This is a little more violent than the birdhouse.
It's called "Demonik."

399
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,400
You play a demon who's been summoned
from hell to clean out this meth lab.

400
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:41,100
Space shuttle.

401
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,867
So... this helps you
look around.

402
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,333
This button is to punch.
This is to jump. This is to duck.

403
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:51,167
This right trigger brings up
your magic spell menu.

404
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,733
And the left trigger lets you
use your magic spells.

405
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:56,067
H-H-How do you
make him walk?

406
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,167
Oh, that's this stick right here.
This here?

407
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,267
Oh, there you go.
Oh, yeah, walk over here.

408
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,933
Okay, go in this room.
Okay, use your telekinesis power to lift those objects.

409
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,833
I don't see
a telephone anywhere.

410
00:28:06,867 --> 00:28:10,033
No, no. It's like a mind power.
Hit the red button. Red.

411
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:12,367
Ooh, perfect.

412
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,900
Okay, you know what,
use your fireballs to blow a hole in that wall.

413
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,733
- Uh, f-f-fire.
- Yeah, yeah, that's great. That's great.

414
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:21,300
- Go in there. Go in there.
- Is this a good or a bad guy?

415
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,333
Uh, that's a bad guy.
He's a drug dealer. Kill him.

416
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh. Oh, I hate violence.
But, oh, drugs are bad.

417
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:30,500
- Wow!
- Ooh, nice Death Spike.

418
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:34,133
Okay, now go in here and use your lightning to blow up those barrels.

419
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:37,200
Ooh!
Oh, isn't that pretty?

420
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,300
Yeah.
Oh, this is fun.

421
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,667
Hey, wow, you got to
a checkpoint.

422
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,067
Is that good?
Yeah.

423
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,267
Well, so that's my game.

424
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
And, uh, you know what,
I have a little more work to do, so if you want to just--

425
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:56,100
Uh-uh. Wait your turn.
I'm on a roll here. Ooh.

426
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,833
Take that,
you dirty dopers.

427
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:03,767
Hey, you know what, Grandma?
Um, I actually have to go see a friend and get some stuff.

428
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,167
So, uh, you keep playing,
and I'll see you later.

429
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,067
Love you.
Oh.

430
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,200
I can't believe there are people in this world who still don't have cable.

431
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,567
Dr. Shakalu gets it.
Yeah, he does.

432
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
Anyways, here's a black box
that gets all the channels,

433
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:38,567
plus pay-per-view
and a bunch of extra wires.

434
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,367
Just don't let a cop see it
or Grandma's doing some time.

435
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,633
So, uh, how do you two
know each other?

436
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:47,233
I met the doctor
at a cockfight in Pomona.

437
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:50,100
He's hooking me up with the lion.
It comes tomorrow. Great.

438
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:55,333
Plus, he brought over some crazy
Zimbabwean weed that'll turn you into a deer.

439
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:01,033
You know that lions
eat deer, right?

440
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:05,200
That's true, kid.
Doctor, we got to be careful.

441
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,200
Oh, shit.
I've been here three hours?

442
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,700
I don't have antlers, do I?
No. You're cool, bro.

443
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:15,467
Thanks for all this.
And, Doctor?

444
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:20,067
Ooh, sorry.
Anytime, kid.

445
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:44,533
Oh, yes!
Finally, a roommate who goes shopping.

446
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:47,167
Chicken cutlet.

447
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,267
Spaghetti with garlic bread.

448
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,767
Oh, my God, the wings
to go with the breast.

449
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,167
I don't know what you are,
but I'm gonna fucking eat you too.

450
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,733
Of course she doesn't have a microwave.
She's fucking 100.

451
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,133
Ooh.

452
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:34,667
Yeah, Dante.

453
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,300
Let's see, let's see.

454
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,733
Good night, my friend.
Sleep well.

455
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,733
Ooh!

456
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:53,033
Ooh, dinnertime.

457
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:58,433
Oh, fucking bitch,
cock-sucking-fucker-ass-fuck!

458
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,033
Oh! Goddamn it!

459
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:14,200
Let me guess.
Was your dick on fire?

460
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,200
Yeah.
Hey, Jeff.

461
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,133
Oh, hey, Alex.
Hey.

462
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:22,167
So, um, I-I finished my first level last night.
How far are you, Alex?

463
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,867
Does it look like I got any levels done last night?

464
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,867
Oh, my God. Geez.
That's crazy.

465
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,767
Wait, wait.
Don't tell me your roommates did that to you.

466
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,867
Yeah. Yeah.
I-It was my roommates.

467
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,400
They, uh-- They're crazy.
They're crazy. They tied me up.

468
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,467
I was like one of those, uh,
calves at the rodeo, all helpless.

469
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,767
And you know what?
Just when I was about to scream for the police, I came.

470
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,100
- Ohh!
- And-And that felt nice.

471
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,500
That is nuts.
That is so hot.

472
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,267
Hey, you guys.
Kane, can you take a look at that for me? Thanks.

473
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,433
Whoa. Alex,
what happened?

474
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:57,633
There was a fire and I was-- I was trying to save it from this baby--

475
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,200
No, he's banging his three roommates.
They tied him up last night.

476
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:02,300
They had crazy orgies,
like, all week.

477
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,667
I don't know what they're talking about.
They're just joking.

478
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,667
No, we're not.
You literally just told us that.

479
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,100
Yeah, well, I don't think
that's very smart,

480
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:11,200
considering you work with your hands.
Yeah.

481
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:15,733
May I see you in my office for a minute, please? Yeah.

482
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:18,433
- Ooh!
- Busted!

483
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:21,167
You are so fired.
You guys are assholes.

484
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
- Bye.
- Hey, you know what? I-I forgot something.

485
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,500
What?
This.

486
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:28,033
Oh, my God!
Are you serious?

487
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:30,200
I think he fucking
shattered it.

488
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:42,800
All right. Look, Alex,
this game has to get finished.

489
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:46,500
And you are the most experienced guy I have here.
I'm really counting on you.

490
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:50,833
My hands being burnt will not affect me finishing my levels at all.

491
00:33:50,867 --> 00:33:53,333
Well, I sure hope it doesn't.

492
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,333
It won't.

493
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:02,500
You know,
you seem really out of place in the video game world.

494
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:06,400
- Why? 'Cause I'm a woman?
- No, 'cause you're a really hot woman,

495
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:08,567
and you are swimming
in a sea of virgins.

496
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,900
Well, that is very flattering
and revealing, Alex.

497
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:15,367
Look, I know you think
I'm really hot too,

498
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,700
and you want to go out with me after work and get a drink.

499
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:21,400
But I have this very serious
deadline that my boss gave me.

500
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:24,767
So until I finish my levels,
I can't have any distractions.

501
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,033
- I guess I'll just have to suffer until then.
- Sorry.

502
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,200
Mr. Cheezle on line two.
I have to take this.

503
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:34,667
Avoid his tea parties.

504
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,733
Hello.

505
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,600
What are you doing, J.P.?

506
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,733
Just thinking about my game.

507
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,567
Huh.
How's that going?

508
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:56,033
People will bow to it.

509
00:34:58,433 --> 00:35:00,567
All right.
That-That's creepy.

510
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,600
I hate your face.

511
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,433
Did you say something?

512
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,433
You're fucking weird.

513
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,167
How can he see me?

514
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,667
Before we can roast it,
I want to get the heat in the pan nice and high.

515
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,500
And we're going to
salt and pepper the pork--

516
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:41,433
Hello, ladies.
Enjoying the new cable?

517
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:44,333
Some of the places do with string,
some of the places do with a net.

518
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,267
You like that cooking channel, huh, Grandma?

519
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,867
And it's all food, all day.

520
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,700
That's all they do,
is they make food.

521
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,900
I want to eat the TV.

522
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:58,767
Thanks a lot, Alex.
Maybe tomorrow you can introduce them to heroin.

523
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,033
...with a label on it.
It's very rare to see a beer stein--

524
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,233
What's this?
Antiques Roadshow.

525
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:06,367
What's that?
Oh, it's great.

526
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,433
People a take in crap and then find out it's worth a lot of money.

527
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,200
Move over, Bea.

528
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,167
I'm an antique.
Yes, you are, Bea.

529
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,400
King Gambrinus, who is
the patron saint of beer--

530
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:23,967
So, ladies, I kind of need
to use the televi--

531
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,700
Shh! Go read your Playgirl
or something.

532
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:32,100
$4,000 for a beer mug?
That's ridiculous.

533
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:35,500
And we'll be right back as thesAntiques Roadshow marathon continues.

534
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,733
Marathon? Fuck me.

535
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,967
Come on.

536
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,100
Ooh. Hi. You're dead.
Bye-bye.

537
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:51,167
What's up? J-dog.

538
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,733
Hey, J-dork, it's Alex.
What's going on, shit lips?

539
00:36:53,767 --> 00:36:57,300
Uh, not much.
Look, I need you to do me a huge favor.

540
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,033
You're not jerking off on my dad.
Ha, ha. Very funny.

541
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:03,967
No, I really need your help.
Do you think you can do some of my levels?

542
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,933
What? No. Why can't you do them?

543
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:09,200
Look, my roommates won't let me get any work done.
They're insane.

544
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:13,033
They won't stop
watching... porn.

545
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:16,833
I can't get anything done.
They're total nymphos. You got to help me.

546
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,933
You're dead to me. Over.

547
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:21,433
Oh. Jeff's a good friend.

548
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:26,067
Uh, this is not
an ordinary Tiffany lamp.

549
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,900
This one is a fish lamp.

550
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:32,267
You can see that
there are fish swimming.

551
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,500
The glass that
these fish are--

552
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:38,900
It's 6:00 already?

553
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:43,233
Ooh!
Okay, I'll make you some breakfast before you do your chores.

554
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:45,500
Oh, no, no, no, Grandma,
don't worry. No.

555
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,267
I'm not that hungry.
I was going to go into work early also.

556
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,433
I don't-- I don't have time
to do any chores today.

557
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,933
Oh, it's just a couple
of things, sweetie.

558
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:57,033
Do you know how to
use a sandblaster?

559
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,833
Where did you get that?

560
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:07,067
Oh, well, there was a break in the marathon on TV,
so I did some of your laundry.

561
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,967
I found that vase in your bag and, well,
it smelled terrible, so I cleaned it.

562
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,067
Doesn't it look nice?

563
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:18,200
Thanks.

564
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Fruit cup? Nice.
Way to go, Mom.

565
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:29,233
Challenge.

566
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:33,000
Quiet, Bobby. Can't you see Alex is sleeping?
He's not taking challenges.

567
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:36,067
No. I'm challenging you, Jeff.

568
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,233
To what game?

569
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:41,167
A little
"Dance Dance Revolution."

570
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,333
That's great, Bobby,

571
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:47,333
but we don't have "Dance Dance Revolution,"
so you're dumb.

572
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:53,367
Ultramix 2!
- When the hell did we get this?

573
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,633
It just came in this morning.

574
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,667
Suddenly, you're not such a big shit-talker anymore,
are you, Jeff?

575
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,600
Looks like my days are numbered here at Brainasium.

576
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,700
Well, can you at least go first so I can see what I'm doing?

577
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:07,933
Oh, with pleasure.

578
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,200
Yeah, lose
the Woody Allen jacket.

579
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:18,033
Dreamin', dreamin', groovin',
if you know what I mean.

580
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:20,067
It's movin' on the scene.
All right.

581
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,733
* Break it for me
Break the one game *

582
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,633
* Break the moves
And be the dance hall king *

583
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:25,800
* Ooh, Chaka Khan
Open in the front *

584
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,267
* Break it for me
Break the one game *

585
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,033
* Break the moves
And be the dance hall king *

586
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,400
* Break it for me
Break the one game *

587
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:40,900
* Break the moves
And be the dance hall king *

588
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,067
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

589
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,267
Good stuff, Bobby.
Nice moves. That was hot.

590
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,200
Well, let's see what we got here.
Hmm.

591
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,433
Are you ready? Dance!

592
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,367
You're gonna break the game,
you're so good!

593
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:32,767
Whoo! That game is fun!
Oh, my God!

594
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,733
A new high score.
- What does "high score" mean?

595
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,967
New high score.
Is that bad?

596
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,167
What does that mean?
Did I break it?

597
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,433
Hey, J.P.

598
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,633
Do-Do you have a second?

599
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,567
You didn't knock, Kane.

600
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,733
I did.
But I think that the music was a little loud.

601
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:33,833
Are you afraid of it?

602
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:37,167
No. I-- I just
don't like techno.

603
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,667
You would if you had
robot ears.

604
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,300
Yeah, I guess.

605
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:48,067
Anyway, I had a suggestion
for "Eternal Death Slayer."

606
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,933
- You know the dwarves in--
- Three.

607
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,000
What?

608
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:54,900
"Eternal Death Slayer 3."

609
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:57,367
Three. Sorry.

610
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,333
Anyway, don't you think that
the dwarves on Level 4...

611
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,833
look a little too similar
to the elves on Level 6?

612
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:05,867
Might be a little
too confusing.

613
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,833
Well, that's an interesting
theory, Kane.

614
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:11,700
But redesigning all those characters at
this stage would be way too expensive.

615
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:16,267
I agree.
But what if you just rendered them a different color?

616
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,500
You know, that would be
cheap and quick.

617
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:22,533
Uh-- Leave the decisions
to me, Kane.

618
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:26,567
There's a reason why I'm the creator of E.D.S. 3 and you're just a tester.

619
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,033
I just--

620
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:32,433
Eject.

621
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,600
He had a good idea.
Shut up. Mind your own business.

622
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
May I speak to you,
my lady?

623
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:02,300
Uh, yeah. I guess.

624
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:05,067
But could you please
knock next time?

625
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,400
And what is it with
this "my lady" stuff?

626
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:09,667
What are you,
a knight of the Round Table? Come on.

627
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,867
Sorry.

628
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,500
- What was that?
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.

629
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:18,733
I just came to tell you that I noticed the dwarves on Level 4...

630
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:22,167
and elves on Level 6 of E.D.S. 3 look way too similar.

631
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Could be confusing to some.

632
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:28,133
Well, uh, what do you want me to do?
I can't push the deadline any further.

633
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:31,400
Well, you wouldn't have to if you just rendered them different colors.

634
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:34,533
Be cheap and wouldn't take
more a than a day or two.

635
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:37,167
Yeah. Yeah, we can
definitely do that.

636
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,700
That... is a great idea.

637
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:43,167
Those are
the only kind I have.

638
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:49,800
There's a symposium on nanotechnology tomorrow at UCLA,
3:00 p.m.

639
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,800
- I thought maybe--
- J.P.

640
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:54,400
- Yeah?
- I'm working.

641
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:57,333
Right. I am too.
I just--

642
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,600
I just thought
I'd let you know.

643
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:03,633
I think that everybody should know.
You should probably make that a memo.

644
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:07,100
- ASAP.
- ASAP. Gotcha.

645
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,133
Hey, dude. What's up, guys?
What did weirdo say about the elves?

646
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,167
Shot it down. What? Really?
That was a good idea.

647
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,533
No, it wasn't.
I'm a piece of shit. I suck.

648
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,633
Relax, Kane. You're not
a piece of shit.

649
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,833
Just run it by Alex.
Maybe he'll talk to J.P.

650
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,000
You'll have to wake him up
out of his sex coma first.

651
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:45,433
He gives me a reason to live.
Him and all those stink-ass hos.

652
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:48,400
Dude, he's living a fantasy.
It's so awesome.

653
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:51,467
No! You guys,
it's not awesome, okay?

654
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,300
Our report is due tomorrow
and he hasn't even started it.

655
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,633
All right? If he doesn't finish it,
were totally f'ed.

656
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,033
Crap.
That's Alex's intercom.

657
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:09,467
Hello?
Delivery at the front desk for you, Alex.

658
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,100
Cool! I hope it's a naked dude with a boner.
What?

659
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:16,767
Nothing. Send it back.

660
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,133
Come on. Let's find Alex's desk.
God bless us, every one.

661
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:23,400
May I help you ladies?
Are you looking for Alex?

662
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:27,800
Yes. I'm Alex's grandmother Lilly,
and these are his roommates.

663
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:29,733
This is Grace
and that's Bea.

664
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:35,600
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you ladies.
Thank you.

665
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,500
We thought it would be nice to bring him a nice homemade lunch.

666
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:40,533
Oh, that's very sweet.
Well, I'm Samantha.

667
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,533
Come on.
I'll show you where he works. Okay.

668
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,033
You're dying.

669
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:53,000
- Hey, Jeff.
- Hi.

670
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:55,233
Is Alex around?
He has some visitors.

671
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:58,367
Uh, no. No, he's not.
Hi, ladies.

672
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,433
Did you go to high school
with Alex?

673
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,233
Thank you.

674
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:07,000
We're his roommates.

675
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,067
You'resthe reason
Alex has been tired all week?

676
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
We have been
sort of rough on him,

677
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:18,700
but he is kind of soft,
if you know what I mean.

678
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:21,367
Well, we're not used to having
a man in the house,

679
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,333
so I guess we--
we ride him pretty hard.

680
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:27,800
- Oh! That is so gnarly.
- So where is he?

681
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,700
Uh, I haven't seen him.

682
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:32,067
He's definitely not under his desk sleeping.
That's a fact.

683
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,400
Well, he's probably
working hard somewhere.

684
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:38,733
Could you please
just give him his lunch...

685
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:42,833
and tell him that I've had such fun playing with his new toy all morning.

686
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:47,200
- And when he comes home later, he can play with me.
- Oh, my gosh!

687
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:49,167
I'm gonna barf.
That is so repulsive.

688
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,967
All right! That's enough.
I'm-I'm here.

689
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,533
- Well, there you are.
- Hi, Grandma.

690
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:58,567
- We missed you.
- I was somewhere else, working hard on something.

691
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,200
- Dude, what is going on?
- This is my grandmother.

692
00:47:02,233 --> 00:47:04,667
Hello.
These are her two roommates.

693
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,700
I've been living with them
for the last week.

694
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:11,067
Okay.

695
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,067
Hi, Grandma, ladies.
Hi.

696
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,033
Good to know. Dude.

697
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,400
Jerking off on my mom
is one thing,

698
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:22,133
but bangin' your grandmother
and her roommates?

699
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:25,500
That's like... legendary.
You're an idiot.

700
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:27,933
Hey, y-you know what, ladies?
Uh, why don't I--

701
00:47:27,967 --> 00:47:31,000
Come on. I'll walk you out.
No, we're gonna go this way, Bea.

702
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh, my God.

703
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:35,367
Holy crap.
Dildo lunch?

704
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,700
Sometimes they're marked like this first one,
which is by Llewellyn.

705
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:44,333
Sometimes they're not.
Sometimes they're just great style, like this one, um--

706
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,467
Oh. Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, Grandma.

707
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,433
Hey, Bea. You know,
you guys should probably go to bed early.

708
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:54,300
You have a busy day tomorrow.
What do you mean?

709
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,433
I don't have any plans.
No.

710
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:59,367
I just figured you wanna be well-rested if you're gonna go to...

711
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,067
Antiques Roadshow.

712
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,500
Oh! Alex,
you're an angel.

713
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:11,400
Oh, you can stay as long as you like and love any man you choose.

714
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,900
Pamela Mills here
in Van Nuys,

715
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:18,033
where a rare breed of African lion was
captured in a residential neighborhood.

716
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:21,200
Sir, what was going through your head when you came upon the lion?

717
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:23,300
This shit is fuckin' crazy.

718
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,267
I don't even know how a lion
got into the neighborhood.

719
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,433
I heard some growlin' and shit
out in the yard.

720
00:48:28,467 --> 00:48:31,767
So my roommate and I,
we go to check the shit out.

721
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,933
I look up in the tree,
and there's the fucking king of the jungle!

722
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:39,867
You know, you ladies should really get some sleep.
Ooh. Yes, that's right.

723
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,233
We need our beauty sleep because we
have to get a lot of things appraised.

724
00:48:43,267 --> 00:48:45,367
Come on, Bea. Come on.

725
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,333
It was starin' right at me.
I almost shit my fuckin' pants.

726
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,500
So I ran inside
and called the 5-0.

727
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:54,567
Good night, ladies.

728
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,167
Time to get
some levels done.

729
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,267
* Come and look me
in the eyes *

730
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,567
* And hit me again *

731
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,700
* When I see you
havin' so much fun **

732
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:18,933
Okay. Okay, okay. All right.
Maybe we can just divide up the levels...

733
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,133
and just do them
right now.

734
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:25,600
There's no time.
We're screwed.

735
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:27,933
Are we gonna get fired?

736
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:30,400
I mean, you might.
We won't.

737
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:32,667
Boy, I hope I do.

738
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,567
I'm a worthless asshole
who deserves to die young.

739
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:43,300
Easy, Kane. He'll be here,
you guys. Relax. Have faith.

740
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:46,000
Don't slit your wrists,
Kane. I'm here.

741
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:49,000
Gentlemen, Levels 10
through 15, all done.

742
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,200
Oh, my God.
I told you.

743
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:54,367
All right!
Who wants a piece of the gray bush?

744
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,200
Still think I should die.

745
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:12,600
Thank you. Thank you.

746
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:16,433
Hopefully, that'll keep away
the bad-energy troll.

747
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,600
Samantha, what's the latest?

748
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:24,167
Well, Mr.
Cheezle, not only have these guys found all the bugs,

749
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,400
but we have detailed instructions on how to fix 'em.

750
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:28,933
- We're back on schedule.
- Phenomenal.

751
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:30,933
Phenomenal.
Great energy.

752
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:33,600
Great energy.

753
00:50:33,633 --> 00:50:35,500
I had a dream last night.

754
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:40,133
I dreamt I was a dove
flying over the sea.

755
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,667
And then I dove
into the ocean--

756
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,567
and I swam with the dolphins.

757
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,367
I was two animals
joined as one,

758
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,033
which meant
good things are coming.

759
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:58,200
Good things.

760
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:04,433
Samantha, why don't you take the guys out for dinner tonight,
on Brainasium.

761
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:06,333
Uh, sure.

762
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,500
Yeah, Samantha.
Take us out.

763
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,933
- Yeah, let's fuckin' rage!
- Rage?

764
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:16,367
Uh, you know, Mr.
Cheezle, fly with the seabirds or whatever you were talking about.

765
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,067
Oh, okay. Okay. Fair enough. Yeah.
Rage it up. Rage all you want.

766
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,433
Good things are coming.
Good things.

767
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:33,667
- Hey, Samantha.
- Hey.

768
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,200
Look, sorry I can't
make the dinner tonight.

769
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:39,567
I just got the new season
of Buffy on DVD,

770
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,567
and I'm gonna kick it in my crib
and watch the bonus features.

771
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,533
Wow. I, uh, didn't even know that that came out.
It hasn't yet.

772
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:49,667
I know people.

773
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:53,867
Cool. Well, you...
have a long night ahead of you.

774
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,600
If you want me to come,
I totally will. Don't worry about it.

775
00:51:57,633 --> 00:52:00,067
Or if you wanna call me afterwards,
you totally can, probably.

776
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,333
Uh, you know, actually,
I'm really tired,

777
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:04,333
so I'm probably not
gonna stay out so late.

778
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:06,333
But, uh, I will definitely
see you on Monday.

779
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:11,267
Listen, uh, I realize
that it must be really...

780
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,767
intimidating to talk to me,
you know.

781
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,333
But underneath this genius,

782
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm simply a human, you know.

783
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:23,067
But I'm working on that.

784
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,100
J.P.?
Yeah?

785
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:27,333
I have to go.
Okay.

786
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,300
Drive safe.

787
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:43,167
I have chosen our
very best table for your party.

788
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,967
Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
This is our harmony table.

789
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,400
Thank you.

790
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:53,133
Take a look, please,
at our very exclusive vitamin water list.

791
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:56,267
Oh, I'll look at that, yeah.
Enjoy the harmony.

792
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:02,533
This is where we get
to have our big dinner, huh?

793
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:04,900
Mr. Cheezle picked it.
There's a shocker.

794
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:09,633
This menu sucks.
The tofu cakes look kinda good, maybe?

795
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:13,233
- Do they even have alcohol?
- Actually, we don't serve alcohol.

796
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:15,733
Bummer, I know. But, uh--

797
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:18,867
this must be your first time
here at Our Lady Health.

798
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,267
I'm Shylo.
I'll be your waiter all day.

799
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,000
I'm sorry. Did you say
your name was Shylo?

800
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:27,167
- Yeah, Shylo.
- That's weird.

801
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,067
- Jeff.
- What? It's weird.

802
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,467
He meant gay.
Stop it.

803
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,867
No alcohol?
This place sucks.

804
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,867
Hey, fella.
Give it a chance.

805
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,367
We do serve shots...
of wheatgrass.

806
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,900
That's cool, if you wanna
be sober and vomit.

807
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:44,633
Uh, excuse me, sir. What do you
recommend for appetizers?

808
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:48,933
Ooh, you know what everyone's buzzing
about is the bean sprout quesadilla. Mmm.

809
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:51,433
You know what?
There's a Tommy burger right down the street.

810
00:53:51,467 --> 00:53:53,467
Let's just do that, you guys.
That sounds good.

811
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,267
Look, guys. Come on.
I know the food's a little different here,

812
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,233
but it's actually good
and good for you.

813
00:53:59,267 --> 00:54:01,600
We don't serve it
with any grease or fat.

814
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:05,033
If we pay extra,
could we maybe get some grease or fat?

815
00:54:05,067 --> 00:54:08,033
Do you have bathrooms or do
I have to shit in the plant?

816
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:15,267
Stupid fucking idiot,
red-shirted ass.

817
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,900
You guys think you're so fucking cool.
Makes me sick!

818
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:24,067
"Let's go make fun of the vegans and their crazy lifestyle.
We're not hurting anyone."

819
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,100
Go eat a hamburger
and choke on a cow dick.

820
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:32,100
Aw. Someone missed their yoga class this morning.
Come on. Let's go.

821
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:37,133
- Nice karma, "Guy-blow."
- You said it wrong, stupid. It's Shylo.

822
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:42,600
- We're really sorry, sir.
- You were sweet.

823
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:45,767
Thank you, Lilly.

824
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,567
I still can't believe they appraised that footstool at $200, though.

825
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,267
I know. Who would have thought
that was early Victorian?

826
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,000
I wanted to
win some money.

827
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:58,800
I tried to tell you that was an old piece of dried dog poop,

828
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:02,200
but you didn't wanna believe me.
Poop-poop-pi-doop.

829
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,633
Hey. This tea has
quite a kick. What is it?

830
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:10,733
I'm not sure. I found this
in one of Sophie's old tins,

831
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:15,500
and I just thought it would be nice to do it in-- in her memory.

832
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:17,533
Here's to you, Sophie.

833
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,267
Come on, Kane. Call it!
I'm winning! I'm winning!

834
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,133
I'm winning! Please!
Call it! Merry Christmas.

835
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:38,867
Please! I can't breathe!
It's not a joke!

836
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,933
There is absolutely no way that you
could ever beat me at any video game.

837
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:44,900
Oh, really?
Yeah.

838
00:55:44,933 --> 00:55:47,667
You know,
while other girls growing up were playing with Barbies,

839
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,100
I was beatin' my brothers
at "Super Mario."

840
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:52,667
Ooh, "Super Mario."
Nice name-drop.

841
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:58,200
- How long have you been a tester?
- Like 10 years?

842
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:01,333
Wow.
I used to be an accountant.

843
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,867
Then I woke up one day
and realized I was miserable.

844
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,633
So I walked into my boss's office and I said, "Dad,
I quit."

845
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,367
"Dad." Nice name-drop.

846
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,767
At the end of the day,
you have to do what you're passionate about.

847
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,967
Exactly.

848
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,967
Plus, you can't get stoned
and be an accountant.

849
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,033
Make too many mistakes,
you lose people millions of dollars, you get fired.

850
00:56:20,067 --> 00:56:21,867
It's like--

851
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,933
Dude, can we go back to your grandma's house?
I have to use the bathroom.

852
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:27,700
We are not goin' to my grandma's house.
Go pee in the alley.

853
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:30,367
I have to pee out of my ass.
Oh, man.

854
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,067
You know what? It's too late to go to your grandma's house.
I should get going anyway.

855
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,200
No, no, no, no, no. It's not that late.
It's right around the corner. We can totally go.

856
00:56:37,233 --> 00:56:39,733
It's an emergency.

857
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:44,633
Now, remember. They're probably sleeping,
so please be quiet.

858
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:48,933
Think I hear voices.

859
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:52,367
Is that Spanish?
Número dos. Ándale.

860
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:12,400
Hey, Grandma.

861
00:57:12,433 --> 00:57:16,033
I don't understand wha--

862
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:19,067
what these people are saying.

863
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:23,767
Chi-Chi Zapata.

864
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,567
Chi-Chi choochy loco-co.

865
00:57:28,267 --> 00:57:30,233
I didn't know
you were bringin' people.

866
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:33,167
I would have...
trimmed my antlers.

867
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:45,900
Your grandma's hilarious.
Yeah, she's not normally like this.

868
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:48,100
Is that beer?
Can I have one?

869
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:50,067
Here, you can have all of them.
Where's the bathroom?

870
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,133
It's upstairs,
to the left.

871
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,733
Oh, I love that music.

872
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,033
Come here, cutie.
Oh, hey.

873
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:01,867
Ow. My face.

874
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:06,767
Hey. Hey, Grandma?

875
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,600
Do you-- Do you think maybe I could
talk to you in the kitchen for a second?

876
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:12,633
Oh, sure, honey.
I want a beer. Okay.

877
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:14,933
Come on. Why don't we have
that beer in the kitchen?

878
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:17,200
Okay, honey. Woo-hoo.

879
00:58:17,233 --> 00:58:20,133
Here's a pill.

880
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:24,233
Grandma, why aren't you
in bed?

881
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,633
Oop. Oh. Excuse me.

882
00:58:33,867 --> 00:58:37,333
Well, w-we were getting--

883
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:39,967
We were getting
ready for bed,

884
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,767
and-and then we had
a pot of Sophie's tea.

885
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,100
- What tea?
- Sophie's tea, from the tin on her dresser.

886
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:53,333
Oh, we thought it would be nice to-- to drink it in memory of Sophie.

887
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:57,233
I can hear my hair growing.

888
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,567
You want some soup?

889
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,967
I-I'm okay, Grandma.

890
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:11,100
My grandma drank all my pot.
That is great.

891
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:15,267
I'm just saying it's cool. I mean,
how many people get to say that in their lifetime?

892
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,500
Do you have any more pot?
No.

893
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:19,867
I could definitely
smoke a joint right now.

894
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,167
Really?
Yeah.

895
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,067
Call that weirdo Dante.
Yeah, call him.

896
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,867
Hey, easy, pothead.
I'll get you your fix.

897
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,900
It's cool if I invited some of my friends from the Crazy Beaver, right?

898
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:38,000
Maybe next time you could go a little less on
the crazy and a little more on the beaver.

899
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:41,233
There's no trouble, bro.
They're people, just like you and me.

900
00:59:41,267 --> 00:59:43,633
Now hit this joint
and have some fun.

901
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:47,100
This isn't the, uh,
"I think I'm a deer" shit, is it?

902
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:50,067
No, you're smokin'
the Frankenstein.

903
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:55,900
- Why is it Frankenstein?
- 'Cause after you smoke it, you walk like this.

904
00:59:55,933 --> 00:59:59,800
Need food.

905
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,300
Look, I'm the Cookie Monster.

906
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:10,000
* Just to see you *

907
01:00:10,033 --> 01:00:12,667
* And I know you *

908
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,500
What's up, homey?

909
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:18,600
Peanut butter.

910
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:21,867
* I gotta touch you *
I love Madame Kamay.

911
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,233
* Baby we'll be
at the drive-in *

912
01:00:26,267 --> 01:00:29,267
* In the old man's Ford *

913
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:34,733
* Behind the bushes
till I'm beggin' for more *

914
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:37,800
Let's just say I learned a lot
about owning a lion.

915
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,600
He learned better
not own one.

916
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:45,633
Nice English words, Dr. Shakalu.
Thank "boo."

917
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:49,467
Hey, Dante.
Uh, my girlfriend and I caught you on the news yesterday.

918
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,900
Really?
Yeah.

919
01:00:51,933 --> 01:00:55,300
By "girlfriend,"
do you mean that piece of rabbit fur you rub on your dick every night?

920
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:59,833
Yeah. Yeah.

921
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:03,433
Hey, man. Lookin' back,
maybe that lion was a bad idea.

922
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:05,967
That's why Dr. Shakalu's
hookin' me up with a monkey.

923
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,933
I'm gonna teach it
tae kwon do.

924
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:15,533
Yeah, a... karate monkey.
You know, that's probably safer.

925
01:01:15,567 --> 01:01:17,367
Yeah. It makes sense.

926
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,700
Who wants some cereal?
Yeah!

927
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:23,567
Colonel Crackers is the best!

928
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,600
Oh, I just wish he would hop off the box and hang out with us.

929
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:29,467
I think he's so cute.

930
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,500
Guess I'm not high enough
to get that one.

931
01:01:33,533 --> 01:01:36,933
Guess what else you're not gonna get,
party pooper?

932
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:38,967
The colonel.
Here, honey.

933
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,067
Sucks to be you, nerd.

934
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,733
Hey, has anybody got a light?
I found some weed.

935
01:01:46,767 --> 01:01:48,933
Oh, I do.
I wanna smoke it.

936
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:52,233
It'll be fun.
What is this?

937
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,433
Ew! It's J.P.'s
phone number.

938
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:59,000
Lucky you.
You guys heard him talk like a robot?

939
01:01:59,033 --> 01:02:01,300
He's a fucking psycho.

940
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,267
Hey, we gotta prank call him.
Let's prank call him.

941
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,133
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

942
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:08,667
Stupid polygon.

943
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,567
Debug! I tried that.

944
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,733
Graphic meter!
No, that's not it.

945
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:19,667
Shit! This is not working.

946
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,133
You'll never finish.
This game is falling apart.

947
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:24,067
No, it's not. Shut up.

948
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,967
You're letting everyone down.
No, I'm not.

949
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,767
I'm gonna make this game,
and it's gonna be the best thing that anyone has ever seen.

950
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,400
Delusional thoughts
from Fantasy Island.

951
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:36,100
You'll never get metal legs.
Samantha is fucking Alex.

952
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:38,033
No, she's not!

953
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:42,033
Oh!

954
01:02:59,633 --> 01:03:02,133
Hmm.

955
01:03:02,167 --> 01:03:07,367
Oh, my God. Hey.
Look how young and cute you are.

956
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,900
Hey.
Oh, my God.

957
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:12,633
Baby want some milk?

958
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:15,200
Baby loves milk.

959
01:03:15,233 --> 01:03:18,300
Oh, my God.

960
01:03:25,933 --> 01:03:29,033
Yeah, suck those jugs, kid!

961
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,467
They're so good.

962
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,567
Oh, kick to the head.
Yeah!

963
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,633
There we go. There we go.
What is that little baby move?

964
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:46,100
You want an ice cream sandwich?
They're on whole wheat with lettuce.

965
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:47,967
Oh, no. That's okay.
But you know what?

966
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I think the bikers want some in the dining room.
Oh, okay.

967
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:53,767
Distract me with my grandmother.
Watch this. Yep. That's right.

968
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,967
"X," "Y," "X." Back-breaker!
Oh, you're dead! I killed you!

969
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,400
So, I mean, what's it like being old?
It's gotta be weird, right?

970
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:03,833
I mean, you saw
a lot of stuff go down:

971
01:04:03,867 --> 01:04:09,733
World War I, World War II,
the automobile, Tupac-- I mean--

972
01:04:09,767 --> 01:04:13,767
I once gave Charlie Chaplin
a hand job.

973
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,367
No way!
Was he silent?

974
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,633
Not after I was
done with him.

975
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:26,200
Oh, you're so cute.

976
01:04:26,233 --> 01:04:28,567
You remind me of Charlie.

977
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,667
You little tramp, you.

978
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:37,300
- * Are you hoping for a miracle *
- Cabo Wabo shots.

979
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:41,267
You're up first, Samantha.

980
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:45,067
I don't think so.
Tequila really messes me up.

981
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,167
It's supposed to.
Come on.

982
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,167
Well, you know,
if you don't do it, I'm gonna do it,

983
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,100
and that's one more thing I beat you at.
Oh, you asshole!

984
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:55,633
All right. Pour me one.
You know what? Pour me two.

985
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:59,600
I feel like Tom Cruise
in Cocktail.

986
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:02,333
Hey, you don't really have to do two.
I was just kidding.

987
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:04,733
What's the matter,
nana's boy? Can't hang?

988
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:10,867
Wow.

989
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:15,500
Someone ass
getting laid tonight.

990
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,033
Doctor, we're not
in the rain forest, man.

991
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:33,700
My beef--
strong.

992
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:36,567
Your beef wrong.

993
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,200
And here I am
with Abbott and Costello.

994
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:42,800
Wow. Which one
did you nail?

995
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:46,533
One? Try both.

996
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,733
You were a dirty old whore.

997
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:53,167
What do you mean, were?

998
01:05:56,967 --> 01:05:59,133
Yes.

999
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:03,133
* Sittin' sideways
boys in a daze *

1000
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:06,500
* Sittin' sideways
boys in a daze *

1001
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:09,267
* Sittin' sideways
boys in a daze *

1002
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,233
* On a Sunday night
I might bang me some maze *

1003
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:15,700
* Sittin' sideways
boys in a daze *

1004
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:17,900
I wanna... sing?

1005
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,133
What? You're too wasted
to sing.

1006
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,733
Whatever. Like there's
such a thing as too wasted.

1007
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:27,200
* Bow wow, baby *
Sorry.

1008
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,967
* The candy paint drippin'
off of the old school Impala *

1009
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:40,967
Ow!

1010
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,967
Oh.

1011
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,867
* Salt 'n' Pepa's here *

1012
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,567
* Salt 'n' Pepa, Salt 'n' Pepa
Salt 'n' Pepa's here *

1013
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,700
* Salt, Salt, Salt
Salt 'n' Pepa's here *

1014
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:59,733
* And we're in effect
Want you to push it, yeah *

1015
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,633
* Coolin' all day then at night working up a sweat *

1016
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:06,367
* Come on,
y'all Let's go show those guys that we know *

1017
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,767
* How to become number one
in a hot party show *

1018
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,733
* Now push it *

1019
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,600
* Push it good *

1020
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,067
* P-Push it real good *

1021
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,200
* Push it good *

1022
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:26,400
* P-Push it real good **

1023
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:31,300
I fucking love this girl!

1024
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:34,200
Yo, Frankenstein!

1025
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,733
Oh.

1026
01:07:56,033 --> 01:07:58,167
Ooh.

1027
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,600
Oh.

1028
01:08:04,067 --> 01:08:06,267
Oh.

1029
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,533
Did I hallucinate
a party last night?

1030
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:12,700
That is adora--
Look at the little cowboy hat.

1031
01:08:12,733 --> 01:08:15,833
Morning.

1032
01:08:15,867 --> 01:08:18,667
Well, you must have been
off duty last night, Sheriff.

1033
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,733
Great, old pictures,
'cause you know, for a minute,

1034
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:23,467
I thought it might be
something embarrassing.

1035
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,900
- What Halloween was that?
- No, that wasn't Halloween.

1036
01:08:26,933 --> 01:08:31,200
That was his first day at high school.
Oh. Are those leopard spandex?

1037
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:34,833
Look. You can see his pee-pee.

1038
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:38,500
Okay, okay. The sheriff demands
that those pictures be burned.

1039
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:41,700
Oh, look here.
Look at this report card.

1040
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:45,133
Let's see.
All A's. Impressive.

1041
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:47,200
I'm a genius.
What can I say?

1042
01:08:47,233 --> 01:08:49,133
Well, you were
up till high school.

1043
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:52,967
Then all of a sudden, he got unfocused.
I guess it was just puberty.

1044
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,500
Yeah. It was
definitely puberty.

1045
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:57,633
Oh, lookit here.

1046
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:01,167
Here's Alex's grandfather
holding baby Alex.

1047
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:05,100
It was 10 years last month.

1048
01:09:05,133 --> 01:09:07,567
I'm so sorry.

1049
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,067
That's why I like Alex
to be in the house,

1050
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:14,200
because it makes me
feel closer to him.

1051
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,600
He loved you so much.

1052
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:23,100
I loved him, and I love you,
and I love being your roomie.

1053
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:25,033
You would have loved
my grandfather.

1054
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:27,933
He was the coolest.
He would have had a beer or two with us last night.

1055
01:09:27,967 --> 01:09:30,000
He would have had 20.

1056
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:33,500
- No, he had a problem.
- He would have definitely fit in with that crowd then.

1057
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:39,100
We had such fun last night.
I've gotta get the name of that tea.

1058
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,200
Oh, my gosh.
It's already noon.

1059
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:44,133
I should probably get going.
Alex, could you give me a ride?

1060
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:46,767
- Oh, yeah. Totally.
- It was such a pleasure.

1061
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,433
Thank you for showing me all the photos.
Come anytime, sweetheart.

1062
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,600
I've got four more boxes.
Okay.

1063
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:53,833
Okay.
Bye-bye.

1064
01:09:53,867 --> 01:09:56,800
Oh.

1065
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:58,467
See you later, Grandma.
Okay.

1066
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:08,933
Barry, I think it's time for you and the milk maid to go home.
Okay, Alex.

1067
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:12,467
Yeah. West West, yo.

1068
01:10:20,067 --> 01:10:22,433
Grace, I have
a confession to make.

1069
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:28,167
Uh, you... were my first.

1070
01:10:29,467 --> 01:10:31,767
Really?

1071
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,033
Oh, that's sweet.

1072
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:38,233
Let's see.
You were my, uh--

1073
01:10:39,867 --> 01:10:42,233
I don't know.
3,000 something.

1074
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:50,867
Word up.

1075
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:53,467
Ah.

1076
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:59,033
I should have
worn a condom.

1077
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,133
Nice place.

1078
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,733
I've never met anyone
with 300 roommates.

1079
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:10,467
Yeah, it gets messy, but
I've got 50 housekeepers, so--

1080
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,633
That helps.

1081
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:15,667
This is my room.
Here we are.

1082
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,667
Yep.

1083
01:11:21,433 --> 01:11:23,367
Thanks.

1084
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,467
So I will, uh...
see you on Monday.

1085
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,467
See you on Monday.

1086
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,067
Thanks for the ride.
You're welcome.

1087
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:42,333
Ah, shit.
I forgot my parking ticket.

1088
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,467
Hey, I forgot my--

1089
01:11:56,067 --> 01:12:00,033
Wow. I just came back
to get my parking ticket.

1090
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:03,933
I know. Here.
What if I had been the bellboy?

1091
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:06,167
I was kinda hopin' you were.

1092
01:12:09,433 --> 01:12:12,633
I'll see you at work.
I'll be there.

1093
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,600
I'll be the older gentleman.

1094
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,933
I am a genius.

1095
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:29,700
Samantha,
you will be mine, mine.

1096
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:35,200
Must ingest more fuel.

1097
01:12:54,267 --> 01:12:56,233
When did I get a message?

1098
01:12:58,867 --> 01:13:02,067
You have one new message.

1099
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,067
Hey, J.P., you fuckin' freak.

1100
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,100
We're partyin'.
Where are you at?

1101
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:08,300
I'll chirp you later.
Here's Sam.

1102
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,367
What do I-- Hey, J.P.

1103
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,167
We celebrated the game tonight,
so-- Jeff, stop it.

1104
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,167
Give me the phone.
My name is J.P.

1105
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,233
I am a robot. I like robots.
I have a robot vagina.

1106
01:13:19,267 --> 01:13:21,333
I am not amused.

1107
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,967
Yes, that's correct.
She gave Charlie Chaplin a hand job.

1108
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,067
Yeah. Next question.
Right here.

1109
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,000
Do you think that she
invented the hand job?

1110
01:13:35,033 --> 01:13:37,000
Ooh. No, I don't.

1111
01:13:37,033 --> 01:13:40,967
But she did say she started the finger in the ass during a blow job.

1112
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,267
Yeah. She was a pioneer.

1113
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:47,600
Uh, the big news from the party,
ladies and gentlemen, Barry sucked on his first booby.

1114
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:51,467
For 13 hours.

1115
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:54,967
Okay. That's enough.
Thank you.

1116
01:13:57,233 --> 01:14:00,733
Jeff, sounded like
quite a fun party Friday.

1117
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:04,933
- What do you mean?
- I got the hilarious message that you and Alex left.

1118
01:14:04,967 --> 01:14:08,033
Almost as hilarious
as your... face.

1119
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:10,000
Look, we were
just kidding, J.P.

1120
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:13,667
* Don't be mad at us **

1121
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,700
So where's Alex?

1122
01:14:15,733 --> 01:14:18,733
What, did he take the day off
and die of old age?

1123
01:14:18,767 --> 01:14:21,700
- No, he went to lunch with Samantha.
- What?

1124
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:34,033
So, who wants to hear about my
S.T.D. from the silent film era?

1125
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:38,200
Yeah, hands up.
This chick's pussy smelled like the Great Depression.

1126
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,067
Do you want
any snacks, Alex?

1127
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,233
Oh. No, thanks, Grandma.
I'm fine.

1128
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,700
Could you
get that please, dear?

1129
01:14:53,733 --> 01:14:55,700
Sure thing, Grandma.

1130
01:14:55,733 --> 01:14:59,333
Maybe it's a fireman stripper, Alex.
I can only hope, Grace.

1131
01:15:03,467 --> 01:15:07,633
- The fuck are you doin' here?
- I need to speak with you, Alex.

1132
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:17,033
It's just that the phone message
really bummed me out.

1133
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:20,400
I-- I can't help it
that I'm different.

1134
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,833
I just--
I want you guys to like me,

1135
01:15:22,867 --> 01:15:27,167
and you look at me
like I'm a f-freak.

1136
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,700
J.P., I gotta be honest.
The robot voice does not help your cause.

1137
01:15:34,733 --> 01:15:39,600
I know.
I do it when I get nervous.

1138
01:15:39,633 --> 01:15:42,867
Look, nobody
hates you, okay?

1139
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,833
I'm gonna talk to Jeff
and the other guys,

1140
01:15:44,867 --> 01:15:46,833
and we'll all go
hang out one night.

1141
01:15:46,867 --> 01:15:50,333
- And Samantha?
- And Samantha.

1142
01:15:50,367 --> 01:15:55,033
Really? That'll be awesome.
Thanks, Alex.

1143
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:58,133
Hey, everyone at Brainasium
totally respects you.

1144
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:01,633
I mean,
you created one of the greatest games ever when you were just a kid.

1145
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:03,433
You're a fuckin' legend, man.

1146
01:16:03,467 --> 01:16:07,633
I know.
I am pretty... amazing.

1147
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:13,200
Mmm. What's that?

1148
01:16:13,233 --> 01:16:16,500
Oh, that's nothing.

1149
01:16:16,533 --> 01:16:18,567
It's-- Well--

1150
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:23,100
It's this game I've been designing in my spare time...

1151
01:16:23,133 --> 01:16:25,100
for the last
couple of years.

1152
01:16:25,133 --> 01:16:28,233
Wow. This 3-D mapping
is so smooth.

1153
01:16:28,267 --> 01:16:30,133
Yeah.
Did you design it by yourself?

1154
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,967
- Yeah. Yeah.
- There's no clipping at all.

1155
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,733
Who did the programming?
Uh, I did that too.

1156
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:40,367
Hey, what can I say?
I'm a 35-year-old prodigy.

1157
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,967
Thirty-five-- prodi--

1158
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,433
The collision detection's
excellent on this.

1159
01:16:46,467 --> 01:16:49,367
Hey, you know what? I could, like,
take this home for you...

1160
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,500
and-and maybe give you
some notes on it or something.

1161
01:16:52,533 --> 01:16:57,267
You know, that's something a normal person...
or a friend would do, right?

1162
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,633
Yeah. Yeah, actually.
That-That would be really cool.

1163
01:17:00,667 --> 01:17:03,600
The lighting effects
are really realistic.

1164
01:17:03,633 --> 01:17:06,800
Here. Just, uh--

1165
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:10,600
Do me a favor, all right?
Don't-Don't be too critical. I-I'm not a genius.

1166
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:14,900
- I'm a genius.
- Yeah, I know you are.

1167
01:17:14,933 --> 01:17:19,333
And also,
dude-- I haven't told any of the guys at work about this.

1168
01:17:19,367 --> 01:17:22,467
It's kind of a secret, uh--

1169
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,633
So just be careful with that disk and-and-and don't tell anyone.

1170
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:29,300
Oh, yeah.
Careful's my middle name.

1171
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:32,000
Actually, it's not.
It's Philip.

1172
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:43,367
- Doctor, hand me a Baggie, please?
- Here go.

1173
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,633
Thanks, pal.

1174
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:48,800
This guy's not gonna rip my heart out of my chest and show it to me,
is he?

1175
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:51,467
No. This is Mr. Lee Ho.

1176
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,733
He's teaching me and Monkey
tae kwon do.

1177
01:17:53,767 --> 01:17:58,000
I got my yellow belt today.
Monkey got his red belt. He's a quick learner.

1178
01:17:58,033 --> 01:18:01,533
Monkey sucker... punch!

1179
01:18:01,567 --> 01:18:05,200
- That's how I got this fat lip.
- Where's the monkey now?

1180
01:18:05,233 --> 01:18:07,400
He's upstairs,
puttin' his nunchakus away.

1181
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,000
Yo, that party
was off the hook, kid.

1182
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,767
Your girl can drink
her fuckin' face off.

1183
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,967
Shut up, Monkey!
I got company, dude.

1184
01:18:19,367 --> 01:18:22,467
Doctor, can you tell Mr. Lee Ho
to go make the monkey be quiet?

1185
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,033
Yes, sir.

1186
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,467
- Lee Ho's the real deal. He's full-on Chinese.
- Yeah, I can see that.

1187
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:59,300
What the fuck?

1188
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:02,167
Mr. Lee Ho?

1189
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,033
Monkey?

1190
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:17,300
Oh, shit!
Monkey, please stop!

1191
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:21,333
You have to cup your arm at the bottom
tightly and then release slowly like this.

1192
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:24,500
Watch.

1193
01:19:24,533 --> 01:19:26,467
Try it.

1194
01:19:28,033 --> 01:19:30,467
Dude, I-- I can't do it.

1195
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,433
Just practice on the weekends and stuff in your free time.
You'll get it.

1196
01:19:38,433 --> 01:19:40,467
Don't tell me
your grandma beats you.

1197
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,233
That's... more believable
than what actually happened.

1198
01:19:44,267 --> 01:19:46,267
So, what's this
big meeting about?

1199
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,733
I think it's about farting.

1200
01:19:52,567 --> 01:19:56,167
Gentlemen, Samantha,

1201
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,833
last night I received
a rough copy of J.P.'s new game,

1202
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:03,267
and let me just say that it invaded my mind with such force...

1203
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,167
I thought I was going to explode
into the atmosphere.

1204
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,300
It really is amazing.

1205
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:12,400
Yes. If you turn your attention
to the monitor,

1206
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:15,100
I'll give you a glimpse
of the future.

1207
01:20:15,133 --> 01:20:17,833
Prepare your minds for...
"Demonik."

1208
01:20:17,867 --> 01:20:19,567
What?

1209
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,533
This is my game.
Shh. I wanna watch.

1210
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:27,667
Uh-- Hey, no.
No. Stop, please.

1211
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,667
This-- This is my game.

1212
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,767
- What are you saying, Alex?
- I've been developing this game for over three years.

1213
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,800
What are you talkin' about?
I've been workin' on this game all year.

1214
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,767
You know that, Mr. Cheezle.

1215
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,767
Okay, that's bullshit.

1216
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,433
RoboBitch came over to my house last night.
I showed him this game.

1217
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:47,200
He said he was gonna give me some notes on it,
not fuckin' steal it.

1218
01:20:47,233 --> 01:20:50,833
- Do you have another copy of the game?
- No.

1219
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:52,700
Oh, well. That's convenient.

1220
01:20:52,733 --> 01:20:54,667
Why didn't you tell me
you were designing a game?

1221
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,300
I don't know.
I-I was self-conscious about it.

1222
01:20:57,333 --> 01:21:01,067
Oh, how cute. He's just trying
to get into your pants.

1223
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,067
Dude, I will come over there and kick your
robot head right off of that skinny fuckin' body.

1224
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:08,733
Wait, Alex.
You're really clouding the energy in this room right now.

1225
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:11,100
Is there any way that you can
prove that this is your game?

1226
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:13,533
Challenge him, dude.
Yeah!

1227
01:21:13,567 --> 01:21:16,167
What's that gonna prove, Jeff?
He probably stole the game from me,

1228
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,633
copied it and learned
all the moves in one night.

1229
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:20,933
- Mr. Cheezle, this is sad.
- Okay. That's it!

1230
01:21:20,967 --> 01:21:22,633
Whoa!

1231
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:25,367
Wow, Alex.

1232
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,967
Dude, you gotta cool down.
And you come back tomorrow and apologize to J.P. I'm sorry.

1233
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,133
Apologize? I been bustin'
my ass on this game!

1234
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:35,800
Okay. Now your energy
is really scarin' me.

1235
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:38,133
You know what?
Fuck energy. Fuck J.P.

1236
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:41,000
Fuck Brainasium.
Fuck all of you. I quit.

1237
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:43,267
- Wait! Alex--
- Let him go. Let him go.

1238
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,467
Let him find his center
and realign his chi.

1239
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:50,433
That's right, Monkey.
Play my head.

1240
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:55,600
I want you to take
the Frankenstein shit,

1241
01:21:55,633 --> 01:21:59,067
the deer shit, the green monster,
the bling and the bling-bling,

1242
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,400
and I want you to roll it all
into one joint.

1243
01:22:01,433 --> 01:22:04,033
No one's ever been
brave enough to try that.

1244
01:22:04,067 --> 01:22:07,767
One man is. Roll it.

1245
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,100
I'll smoke it with you, bro.
We'll go to the loony bin together. I don't give a fuck.

1246
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:22,133
Hey, Lilly. Is Alex here?
Hi, Samantha.

1247
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,300
No, honey.
He should be at work.

1248
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:26,300
But-- Why?
Is there something wrong?

1249
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:30,533
No. He's not hurt or anything.
There was an argument at work over this video game, and--

1250
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:34,033
- Alex's game, "Demonik"?
- Yeah. Do you know it?

1251
01:22:34,067 --> 01:22:36,533
Of course. I love it.

1252
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:38,633
I'm almost at
the final checking point,

1253
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,267
except I have to deal
with those zombies.

1254
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:43,267
They keep biting my neck.

1255
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,633
- Hey, Lilly. Could you do me a favor?
- Sure.

1256
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:51,067
I'm videotapin' this
for scientific research.

1257
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,133
This shit will be
on the Discovery Channel.

1258
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:06,300
Don't judge me, Monkey.

1259
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:15,400
I just don't understand it. Why would anybody do that,
try to steal that from him?

1260
01:23:15,433 --> 01:23:17,433
I don't know, Lilly,
but he's not gonna--

1261
01:23:17,467 --> 01:23:19,367
Keep tryin', guys.
Backstreet for life. Oh, hey.

1262
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,333
Hey, Jeff.
Can you find Alex?

1263
01:23:21,367 --> 01:23:24,733
I'm gonna take his grandmother to Cheezle's
office and get this mess figured out.

1264
01:23:24,767 --> 01:23:27,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not a problem.
Totally. Thank you.

1265
01:23:27,433 --> 01:23:30,667
Hello, Jeffrey.
What's up, silver fox?

1266
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,767
Why are you so sweaty?

1267
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,267
Oh, I started a fight club.
Oh.

1268
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:37,333
Yeah. So, where's Alex?

1269
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:39,500
We don't know.
Nobody can find him.

1270
01:23:40,533 --> 01:23:43,033
I know where he is.
Come on, babe.

1271
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:53,767
You got skills.

1272
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:00,433
Wh-- What is that ringing?

1273
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,367
Do I have a tumor?

1274
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,400
Oh. Hello?

1275
01:24:06,433 --> 01:24:09,900
- Hey, Dante. Is Alex there?
- Hold on.

1276
01:24:09,933 --> 01:24:12,400
Phone's for you.
I think it's the devil.

1277
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:18,667
- Hello?
- Hey, Alex. You gotta come back to work.

1278
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:22,367
I quit there
fuckin' months ago, man.

1279
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,833
How baked are you right now?
Who is this?

1280
01:24:25,867 --> 01:24:30,833
Is this Marv Albert?

1281
01:24:30,867 --> 01:24:33,867
God, you're torched.

1282
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,400
Um-- Okay, look.
There's an emergency.

1283
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:38,533
J.P. revealed himself
to be an actual robot,

1284
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:41,500
and he kidnapped your grandma,
and he's gonna eat her soul out of her head.

1285
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:44,933
My grandmother's in trouble?
I'll be right there.

1286
01:24:44,967 --> 01:24:47,267
He's on his way.

1287
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:51,000
How much time to we have?
Enough time to 69.

1288
01:24:51,033 --> 01:24:55,000
Oh. Just like Don Knotts.
Oh. Hello, Mayberry.

1289
01:24:55,033 --> 01:24:58,367
You gotta give me a ride.

1290
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,067
I'm way too baked to drive
to the devil's house.

1291
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:09,100
Drive, Monkey! Drive!

1292
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,433
I love what you did
with the bit-mapping.

1293
01:25:14,467 --> 01:25:19,667
Very stylish, very aggressive,
very, very Miyamoto.

1294
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,667
Right. That's what
I was going for.

1295
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,300
- Um, excuse me, Mr. Cheezle?
- Yes, Samantha?

1296
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:30,200
- I have proof that J.P. stole Alex's game.
- What proof?

1297
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:41,567
I can't believe
this stupidity!

1298
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,167
You actually want me to play a 90-year-old woman?
Ninety?

1299
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,333
Grandma.

1300
01:25:47,367 --> 01:25:52,100
What are you doin' here?
I'm tryin' to show these people that you are not a liar.

1301
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:54,700
Okay, let's go.
Let's start the game.

1302

Take this Level 2 lightning.

1309
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:27,133
That's not good.
Don't worry. You're fine.

1310
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,733
Take a little bit
of the plague.

1311

Don't forget I'm a prodigy.

1316
01:27:00,533 --> 01:27:04,100
And don't forget
it's my grandson's game.

1317
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:07,800
I will taste your flesh!

1318
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:22,100

1319
01:27:22,133 --> 01:27:25,600
- You guys, stop.
- That's right, Grandma.

1320
01:27:25,633 --> 01:27:28,033
I am so sorry
I didn't believe you, Alex.

1321
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:33,667
You know, I had a dream last night.
I was a snake slithering through the grass,

1322
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,033
until I came upon
a dead elk.

1323
01:27:37,067 --> 01:27:42,700
And I climbed... into his soul.
And it's there I stayed until morning.

1324
01:27:42,733 --> 01:27:48,533
Which meant that I will...
underestimate someone very close to me.

1325
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:52,667
Wow. Where do you get
your weed?

1326
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,267
- From you, Dante.
- Oh, yeah!

1327
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,767
What's up, Mr. Cheezle?

1328
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,933
Okay, J.P. Let's go.

1329
01:28:01,967 --> 01:28:03,867
We'll have your mom
come and pick you up.

1330
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,667
Take care, J.P.

1331
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:13,267
Please sit on my face.

1332
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,333
That was not appropriate.

1333
01:28:17,567 --> 01:28:19,333
* You're the stuff
You're the mind *

1334
01:28:19,367 --> 01:28:21,400
