下午1：05
学期最后一天

1
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,248
I've got your final tests here.

2
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,089
Everybody did pretty well.
Uh, I'm gonna call your?

3
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,129
I'm headed this way.
我走这边
4
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,060
- Later.
- 再见
- So, what did we decide?
- 我们有什么决定？

5
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,693
- About what?
- 决定什么？
- About tonight.
- 今晚的事
6
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:54,764
Oh, uh, look, I'll probably get, you know,
hung up with the guys maybe, you know, later.

7
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,844
- Why don't we just meet at the party?
- All right.

8
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:00,472
- Wouldn't want you waitin' around for me all night anyway.
- All right. Whatever.

9
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:02,516
- Cool. I'll see ya later?
- Bye.

10
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,517
Bye.

11
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:18,257
- Slater-san.
- Hey, man.

12
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:24,629
- How's it goin'?
- Fixin' to be a lot better, man.

13
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,537
- What time is your party tonight, man?
- 9:30, man.

14
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,543
9:30. Hmm.

15
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:34,706
Okay. Um, I'll be there, man.

16
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,716
Slater, alligator.

17
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,981
Wait, wait. I gotta
cruise by this afternoon...

18
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,921
on a little business, if you
know what I'm talkin' about, so ?

19
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:46,892
- That's what you're talkin'about.
- That's what I'm talkin' about, man.

20
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:49,361
Oh, man, I'm fuckin' wasted.

21
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,932
Walkin' down the hall by myself.

22
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,164
Smokin' a "J" with 50 elves.

23
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,740
- Later.
- Woodward. Bernstein.

24
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,704
Guess that makes you Deep Throat.

25
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,212
- So, is this a smoked or a liquid lunch?
- Hey.

26
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,215
Smoked, right?

27
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:12,252
- So, guys, are we gonna play poker tonight?
- Count me out.

28
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,789
- Sure.
- Uh, I'll probably be going to Pickford's party later, okay? So ?

29
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,858
- No. We should do somethin' like that.
- Yeah.

30
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,621
- Goodwin's on his senior trip. We can play poker anytime.
- Go to a party?

31
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,355
- "Go to a p ?? Come on.
- Come on.

32
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,930
- Mike. Cynthia.
- It's under control.

33
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,830
- I don't feel comfortable at those kinds of things.
- Pick us up at 8:00.

34
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,834
- Okay. All right.
- It's gonna be all right.

35
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,201
- Guess we're going to the party. Okay.
- All right.

36
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,675
Oh, Mike. I gotta tell you about
this dream I had last night.

37
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,678
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- But, um...

38
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,805
- you gotta promise not to tell anyone.
- Yeah, sure.

39
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:42,906
- No. Say, "I promise. "
- Jesus.

40
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,451
- I promise not to tell anyone.
- Okay, thank you.

41
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,453
Um, well ?

42
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,718
Okay, there I am, and
I'm gettin' it on ?

43
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:53,157
You know, with what had
this perfect female body.

44
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,161
Uh-huh.

45
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,356
But ?

46
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,729
- What? What? What?
- Um, I can't say.

47
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,826
Come on, man. You can't give a
buildup like that and not deliver.

48
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,770
I mean, come on. A perfect
female body. It's not a bad start.

49
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,232
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.

50
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,506
- Ah.
- I mean, the hat and the beard.

51
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,411
Oh, well. Best not think too
deeply on this one, right?

52
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,645
- Best not.
- Um, I gotta get some stuff from Mr. Birchfield.

53
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:23,884
- Uh, see you in a few minutes.
- I understand. Right. I'm sorry.

54
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,926
Gilligan's transistor radio
mouth. Yeah. That was a good one.

55
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,995
Hey. What about that one where that sexy surfer
guy catches that huge wave and lands on the island?

56
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:36,764
- Oh, yeah! - Do you remember
that? - "Sexy surfer guy. "

57
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,431
- The Mosquitoes. Do you remember that?
- Pink, let's go.

58
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,304
- Come on.
- They were a rock group. Ginger and Mary Ann formed their own group?

59
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,503
Look, man. I can't go yet
until Miss Wilk gets here.

60
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,343
- So why don't you go get Benny and check me out on the way back, okay?
- All right.

61
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:52,078
- What?
- Coach gave me something to give to you.

62
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,957
- They're really doing this.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:01,119
He wants them all back by the end of
the day too. Can you believe that one?

64
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,595
- And everybody's signing it?
- Just to get him off our back.

65
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,394
The coaches are just being fucking
assholes. Know what I'm saying?

66
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,198
I mean, you sign it, you never
think about it again. Just let it go.

67
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,104
- You're gonna make a big
deal out of this, aren't you?

68
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:19,604
You You're gettin' air from there,
man. It's no good. You see this?

69
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,614
It's gotta be tight.

70
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:25,709
- You're gonna have to put some gum
around the base of that to get a good hit.

71
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,648
Slate.

72
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,695
Benny. Psst.

73
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:38,493
- Man, I ain't believin'that shit?
- Two minutes.

74
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,159
About Bonham's one-hour drum solo.

75
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,136
One hour of drums? You couldn't
handle that shit on strong acid, man.

76
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,143
Okay.

77
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,105
Okay. We're gonna go to the bathroom.

78
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,182
Could you guys let Miss Wilks know?

79
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,383
All right. This is totally amazing.

80
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:03,048
"I voluntarily agree to not
indulge in any alcohol, drugs...

81
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,148
"or engage in any other
illegal activity...

82
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,422
"that may in any way jeopardize
the years of hard work...

83
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:13,899
we as a team have committed to our
goal of a championship season in '76."

84
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,799
- What bullshit.
- The guys are actually signing this crap?

85
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,804
- Apparently.
- God, what are they gonna do next?

86
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,205
- Like, give you guys urine tests or something?
- I didn't know that drugs and alcohol...

87
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,972
were such a big problem that they
had to resort to neo-McCarthyism.

88
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,139
I think they're just afraid some of
us might be having too good a time.

89
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,308
It's the old age suppressing
youth thing, you know.

90
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:33,581
- "Neo-McCarthyism. " I like
that. - Oh, that's good, Tony.

91
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:37,419
And there you guys were in class trying to
list all the Gilligan's Island episodes...

92
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,425
without even a hint of irony.

93
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,823
What in the hell are
you talking about, girl?

94
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,922
- You weren't thinking about it, were you?
- Gilligan's Island?

95
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,968
It's what's called a
male pornographic fantasy.

96
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,630
- Oh, my?
- Think about it.

97
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,197
You're basically alone on a deserted
island with two readily available women.

98
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,039
One, a seductive sex goddess type.

99
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,911
The other, a healthy girl-next-door
type with a nice butt.

100
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:04,746
So guys have it all. The
Madonna and the whore.

101
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,945
Women get nothing.

102
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,421
We get a geek, an
overweight middle-age guy...

103
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,458
some nerdy scientific type.

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,552
- I mean?
- The professor is sexy.

105
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,063
Pink, come on, man.

106
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,759
We're off to raise some hell.
Look at that. Look at that!

107
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,927
- Guys.
- Look at?

108
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,733
- All right. Let's go kick some ass.
- Hey, you guys.

109
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,740
- You guys, wait up.
- What?

110
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,469
- Benny.
- What?

111
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,636
- I have a favor to ask ya.
- What do you need?

112
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,680
Take it easy on my
brother this summer, okay?

113
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,681
- All of you.
- Mitch Kramer?

114
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,273
- Yeah. Mitch Kramer.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,582
- I'm gonna give him a beating he'll never forget.
- Ow!

116
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,521
Well, just don't get him more
than the other guys. Any of you.

117
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,990
- Kind of little. All right?
- Got our word, sis.

118
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,789
- Little brother'll be okay.
- Thanks. See you guys.

119
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,796
Ow!

120
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,923
Benny!

121
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:55,662
- These guys. I don't know.
- Oh, you love it.

122
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,671
Oh, there's just a little bit
of bullshit in all that, right?

123
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,934
Major bullshit. He's a
dead man. He's fuckin' dead.

124
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,509
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!

125
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,380
Check it out, boys, huh? I've been
waitin'three long years for this one.

126
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:13,544
- Oh, yeah.
- Thosejunior high kids are dead meat. I promise you.

127
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,748
- Beat 'em!
- Oh, man. Oh, yeah.

128
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,733
Okay, all you freshman fucks. Listen up.

129
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:33,637
It's your lucky day. Usually you'd be spending
your freshman summer getting your asses busted...

130
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,971
and running for your
worthless little lives...

131
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,409
but this year, because we
feel so sorry for you...

132
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,003
we're gonna take it easy on you...

133
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,174
and save us all a lot of time.

134
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:46,310
So, if you meet here ?right here ?

135
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,320
after school today...

136
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,788
you only get one lick from each of us.

137
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,825
But you run like cowards ?

138
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:57,523
well, it's open season
all summer long, boys.

139
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,191
Oh, yeah. Mitch Kramer?

140
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,031
Mitchy. Mitchy, Mitchy, Mitchy.

141
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,273
We're looking for you, pal.

142
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:08,899
Your ass will be purple
before the day is over.

143
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,011
Have a nice afternoon.

144
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,448
You better get out of town.

145
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,075
Go spend the summer with your
grandparents or somethin'.

146
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,218
Hey, man. You are gonna show up
to our game tonight, aren't you?

147
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:26,919
Yeah. I'm pitching. I kind of have to.

148
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,496
How should we inscribe your tombstone?

149
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,164
How about "Ben Over"?

150
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:36,828
Yeah, right, pissant. Why
aren't they after anybody else?

151
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,905
They are, man. Believe me.

152
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,906
I know, man.

153
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,442
- Come on, Mel. Hop on.
- Let's go, boy.

154
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,555
Oh, shit.

155
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,659
Hey, Coach.

156
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,886
So, tell me.

157
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,864
Any of you girls gonna be ready
to play some football this fall?

158
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,866
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know, Coach.

159
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,732
You know, uh, I been doing so good
in English classes, you know...

160
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,965
I figured I'd take next
fall off and become a writer.

161
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:15,042
What do you think about that, huh?

162
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,203
Boy, you wouldn't know how to write your
name if it wasn't stenciled on your locker.

163
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,771
No, seriously. Everybody. Now, don't
go getting soft on me this summer.

164
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:27,445
You know, you're sitting around the
pool all day, chasing the muff around.

165
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,682
Break down!

166
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,248
Hell, man. My grandmother's quicker
and tougher than you pansies.

167
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,260
Of course, she's 6'3", 250.

168
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,557
Runs a 4.540.

169
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,792
What's the matter with you, Floyd?

170
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,267
What, quarterbacks don't have to do
what their coaches say? Is that it?

171
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,634
Dawson, did you give
him that pledge sheet?

172
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,708
- The pledge sheet. You give it to him?
- Yeah, Coach. It's right here.

173
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,041
Randy, if you could get that back to us by the
end of the day, we'd feel a lot better about it.

174
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,479
- You guys see that he does this, okay?
- All right, Coach.

175
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,483
See ya, Coach.

176
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,019
- Randy Floyd.
- Aw, shit.

177
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:04,080
Before next fall, you're in need of a
serious attitude adjustment, young man.

178
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,091
You better get your priorities straight.

179
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:10,152
And watch out with that other crowd you're
runnin' with. Don't think I haven't noticed.

180
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,664
- Hey! -
Uh-oh, Pink.

181
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:17,328
I want that piece of paper on my desk
before you leave here today. Do you hear me?

182
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,974
Get an attitude adjustment.
You know what I mean?

183
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,777
- Priorities straight, buddy.
- Runs with a bad crowd.

184
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,784
- Bad people.
- Watch yourself.

185
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:37,791
Yeah, well, I've got Coach's and everybody
else's attitude-adjusted priorities...

186
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,292
right here.

187
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,362
- Yeah, that's good, Pink.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,129
Oh! Did you know O'Bannion flunked?

189
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,202
Yeah. What a dumb-shit.

190
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:56,206
Whoo! Y'all ready to bust some ass?

191
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,369
- What's up, Don? Benny. Melvin.
- Hey.

192
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,379
- See ya later.
- Good to see ya.

193
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,972
Yeah.

194
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,018
Hey. We gotta take your truck.
I'm low on gas. All right?

195
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,680
- We need to take my truck?
- Yeah. Okay?

196
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,689
- Yeah.
- Good.

197
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,123
- What are you doing? Picking up trash?
- What? What?

198
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:16,822
Man, I was just waiting for one of
them idiot coaches to piss me off again.

199
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,195
I think you take the whole
thing a little too personal.

200
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,030
I think you just gotta
?You gotta shake it off.

201
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:25,196
Don, have you ever thought
about why we play football?

202
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:29,265
I mean, how many times have you gotten laid
strictly because you're a football player, huh?

203
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,178
I don't know. A few probably.

204
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,182
A few? Don, all I'm saying is that...

205
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:41,243
I bet we could do just as well
if we were in a band or somethin'.

206
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,755
Well, I gotta put in a
final appearance. So ?

207
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,382
Wait a minute. Who you
got goin' in there? Shh.

208
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,062
Vicky. Vicky!

209
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,894
Come on. Let's skip out. Let's
go get naked right now. Let's go.

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,558
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

211
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,499
- Mr. Dawson.
- Yeah.

212
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:58,504
Why don't you take it somewhere else?

213
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:01,268
Oh, Mr. Floyd. Are you gracing
us with your presence today?

214
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,639
Uh, might as well.

215
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,942
You know, Ginny, I was thinking maybe you
and I can get together over the summer.

216
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,347
It'll be legal. We could make things
happen. I'll keep it mum's the word.

217
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,420
I promise. I swear to you.

218
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,324
At the party tonight, I heard there's
gonna be a girl with knockers this big.

219
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,362
- Bullshit. - Promise. Two
handfuls. - Shut up, Carl.

220
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,364
- No way.
- Yes.

221
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,663
- Uh-uh. -
Hey. Psst. Hey.

222
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,169
Pentico got his brother's car. Let's go.

223
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,172
- Cool, man.
- Cool.

224
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:36,038
- Go talk to him.
- I'm not going alone.

225
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,668
Come on. Come on. Ask him.

226
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,714
Uh, Mr. Payne, sir...

227
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,216
you know, every second that
you could let us out early...

228
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,015
would really increase
our chances of survival.

229
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,892
It's like our sergeant told us
before one trip into the jungle.

230
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,028
"Men!

231
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,226
Fifty of you are leaving on a mission.
Twenty-five of ya ain't comin' back. "

232
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,938
Okay.

233
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,968
You know, the '68
Democratic Convention...

234
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,567
was probably the most
bitchin'time I ever had in my life.

235
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,910
Hey, guys. One more
thing. Hey. This summer...

236
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:19,042
when you're being inundated with all this
American bicentennial Fourth ofJuly brouhaha...

237
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,451
don't forget what you're
celebrating, and that's the fact...

238
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:24,183
that a bunch of slave-owning
aristocratic white males...

239
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,225
didn't want to pay their taxes.

240
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,352
- Yeah!
- Have a good summer.

241
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,255
Hey. Over there. Let's get 'em.

242
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,564
Hey! No cutting.

243
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,878
Hey. Hey, hey.

244
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:59,441
Hey!

245
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,453
- Run, man!

246
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,549
Jump in. Come on. We gotta go.

247
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

248
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,222
- Whoo!
- Hurry up, Hirshfelder. We're gonna leave your ass.

249
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,231
- Sorry, man.
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.

250
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,325
- Whoa. Back it up. Back it up.
- Oh, shit!

251
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:19,429
- Whoo-ee! Ducks on the
pond. - How you doin', boys?

252
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,701
Whoo!

253
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,709
Wake up, bitch. Wake up.

254
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:33,082
Open. Open. Hey, hey. Open.

255
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,458
Okay. Open wide.

256
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,529
Open wide.

257
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,590
- Open. Yeah.
- What do you think?

258
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,100
All right. We got 'em.

259
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,364
Hey, you. Come here.

260
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,642
You.

261
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,870
- Who are you?
- Uh, nobody.

262
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,539
I mean, I wasn't in the truck.

263
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,116
- Are you a freshman?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,686
Well, are you in, or are you out?

265
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,982
- In.
- Let's go.

266
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,726
Come on! Let's go!

267
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,853
Go! Come on! Hurry up!

268
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,761
Oh, man. We're screwed!

269
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,391
- Pentico, lose them.
- I'm tryin', man!

270
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,993
Whoo!

271
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,369
- Let's go! Come on!
- Who you fuckin' with?

272
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,671
- Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!
- Drive! Drive this piece of shit!

273
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,836
Shut up, man. Here they come.

274
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,749
Fucking turn!

275
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,252
Oh, shit!

276
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,861
- Come on! Let's go! Whoo!

277
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,432
Oh, shit! Here they come!

278
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,799
I think we really pissed them off,
man. Just drop me off at my house.

279
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:59,236
- Are you still with me?
- Yeah. I guess.

280
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,603
- This is my house.
- They're slowing down.

281
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,700
You get out and get 'em. You get out.

282
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,109
- Good luck, man. Be there tonight.
- All right.

283
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,447
All right. I'll catch up with
you guys later. Go, go, go.

284
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,786
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, nice try, freshmen.

285
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,452
Tell you what. Just for being
such brave little kids...

286
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,928
I'm only gonna give each
of ya five licks, okay?

287
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,489
All right. Grab a pole
then, kids. Let's get goin'.

288
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,126
I don't think so, creep.

289
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:32,228
Mom!

290
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,467
Carl, get in the
house. Get in the house!

291
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:40,335
And you ?Get the hell off my property.

292
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:45,009
Oh. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. I was just
escorting your fine young son home from school.

293
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:48,019
There's?There were some
ruffians about, and I?

294
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,988
Oh, and, uh, Mitch, Carl.

295
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,992
We'll be seeing each other again.

296
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:02,368
Oh, that's it. I fuckin'saw that, you
little sack of shit. You two are fuckin'dead!

297
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,495
You hear me? You're fuckin' dead!

298
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,197
Excuse me. Thank you.

299
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,272
All right, you little freshman bitches.

300
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:18,180
Air raid!

301
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,116
That was pathetic!

302
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,120
You guys are crumbs!

303
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,124
Let's try it again! That means get
up, you lazy little bitches. Get up!

304
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,126
You heard her!

305
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,322
Air raid!

306
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:35,527
That was horrible, you little slut
girls. You little freshman sluts. Get up!

307
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:39,367
Get up! Up! Up! Up!

308
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,237
Air raid!

309
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,310
What's fascinating is the
way not only the school...

310
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,471
but the entire community seems to be
supporting this ?or at least turn their heads.

311
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,879
- They apparently have permission to use the parking lot.
- Right.

312
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,451
No parents seem to mind. You
know. They're selling concessions.

313
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,019
- I mean ?
- I know.

314
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:57,522
The seniors, we tried. We
We gave you all a chance.

315
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:02,652
But since you little prick-teases
can't follow instructions...

316
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,732
we're just gonna have to
try something else, won't we?

317
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,993
Seniors ?

318
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,831
You love us. Smile. You love us.

319
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,570
Turn over.

320
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,550
Suffer, sisters!

321
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,744
Suffer!

322
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,753
Whoo!

323
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:37,122
Eat it! Open wide!

324
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,098
- Open wide! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
- # Why can't we be friends #

325
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,431
Yes! Whoo!

326
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,869
Love it, girls. Love it!

327
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,532
Gorgeous babies.

328
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,137
Welcome to high school, honey.

329
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,737
- You love it, honey.
- You little bitch!

330
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:00,252
#I remember you when you drank my wine #

331
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,719
- # Why can't we be friends #
- Go!

332
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,848
Propose to Mr. Dawson.

333
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,893
You idiot.

334
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,489
- Will you marry me?
- Don't know. What's in it for me?

335
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,089
- Suck on it harder.
- Anything you want.

336
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,101
- Anything?
- Anything.

337
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,228
Go like this.

338
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,399
- Do you spit or swallow?
- Oh ?

339
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,171
Whatever you I-like.

340
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:27,576
Whatever I like? I would
definitely marry you.

341
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,581
- That is so degrading.
- Let's go.

342
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,676
- You're an asshole.
- Yes, I am.

343
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:36,756
That's terrible, man. It's horrible.

344
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,451
Aha!

345
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,027
I just want you guys to
know I feel for you, man.

346
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:45,326
I did it when I was a freshman, and
you'll do it when you're a senior.

347
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:49,129
But you're doing great. Now fry like
bacon, you little freshman piggies!

348
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:51,466
Fry! Fry!

349
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,562
- Hi.
- Hi.

350
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:57,507
- Hello there.
- I would like for you to propose to Tony.

351
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,442
Oh, God.

352
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,514
On your knees.

353
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,184
Will you marry me?

354
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,553
- What am I supposed to say here?
- I ?I don't know.

355
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,058
Um, what'll you do for me, huh?

356
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,288
Um, anything you want.

357
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,365
- Imagine the possibilities.
- Oh, Jesus.

358
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,366
No, seriously, you can stand up.

359
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,527
- Um, what's your name?
- Sabrina.

360
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:25,036
- I'm Tony.
- Hi.

361
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,800
- Anthony actually.
- Sorry.

362
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,808
- This is Mike.
- Hey.

363
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,004
We were just discussing the utter
stupidity of these initiation rituals...

364
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,809
and we were we're kind of
wondering why someone like you...

365
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,248
would subject yourself to
the losing end of it all.

366
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,319
What are we having?
Social hour over here?

367
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,184
I'm supposed to be being
a bitch. Back to the pit.

368
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,053
All right, kiddo.

369
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,991
- It's almost over. Don't worry about it.
- So, uh, am I mistaken...

370
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,892
or was there a little unspoken
thing going on with that young vixen?

371
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,897
- You stud.
- You know how it is.

372
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,196
- I bet she's pretty cute once you clean all the shit off her.
- I bet she is.

373
00:23:56,303 --> 00:24:00,933
Okay, girlies! It's hot out here, and
I'm really sick of looking at all of you.

374
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,407
So let's just ?Let's get out of here.

375
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,469
What are you looking at? Wipe
that face off your head, bitch.

376
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,947
Let's go! Get in the truck!

377
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,018
Get in the truck! Come on!

378
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,382
You know, maybe if you
ever left the poker table ?

379
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,682
Maybe if I ever left the
poker table? What about you?

380
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,953
Whatever. I mean, the point is, that's
why we're going out tonight. You know?

381
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,121
Who knows? You might experience something a
little more tangible than an Abraham Lincoln dream.

382
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:27,190
- That's, like, a hairline fracture right there.
- Shit.

383
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,564
- What's that about? What'd you do?
- I wouldn't doubt it.

384
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,830
My boy Benny was wearing
their asses out, boy!

385
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:36,068
- Shit.
- I just gave him a little beating he'll never forget.

386
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,144
Here's to ya, Ma.

387
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,374
That's your fucking mother.

388
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,780
Say, man. Fuck the coaches,
man. Just do it for us, man.

389
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,853
- You picked this thing up?
- Yeah. You know.

390
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,012
Hey. What are you doin'?

391
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:51,022
- He ain't doin' shit now.
- What?

392
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:54,719
Got any more details of my life you got
figured out you can let me in on, Ben?

393
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,296
Lots of details.

394
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:00,298
- Hey, O'Bannion, what are you doing?
- What's happening?

395
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,368
Oh, you didn't hear, did you?

396
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,733
- What?
- Didn't hear I got a shotgun pulled on my ass?

397
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,738
- No way!
- Swear to God.

398
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,740
# Seniors are the best #

399
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,776
# Seniors, seniors #

400
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,777
S- E- N-I-O-R-S ##

401
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,909
Oh, my God!

402
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,244
# Seniors, seniors #

403
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,514
#They are the best #

404
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,002
Ow. Freezing!

405
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,369
Hey, Mrs. Pickford.

406
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,667
Hi, guys. You here to see Kevin?

407
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:44,005
- No. Actually, we came here to see you.
- Oh.

408
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,511
- Bet you're glad school's out, aren't you?
- Yeah. We got our report cards today.

409
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:49,946
- How did you do?
- Straight A's.

410
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,143
- Both of you?
- Yeah.

411
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:54,516
- Big trip, huh?
- We're going away for the weekend.

412
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,351
- Oh, you're taking Kev with ya, huh?
- No. He's staying here.

413
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,357
Oh. Oh, he is. Oh.

414
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:02,053
- Thanks.
- Go on in. He's up there somewhere.

415
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:12,004
- Let's get together sometime. All right?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

416
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,005
- All right.
- Be lots of fun.

417
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,098
- Yeah.
- What do you do? I mean, for fun.

418
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:19,804
Usually just hang out with the girls. You
know, drive around. That kind of stuff.

419
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,313
There's a big party tonight.
It should be really great.

420
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,383
- Oh.
- So ?

421
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,318
- Do you want to come?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

423
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,322
- Cool. Think it'll be all right?
- It'll be fine.

424
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,619
- Great. We'll pick you up at about 8:30.
- Okay. Cool.

425
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,627
- See you then.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

426
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,754
Bye.

427
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,458
All right. Let's go. We gotta get ready.

428
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,911
Sample of the goods.

429
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,948
Fifteen bucks.

430
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,519
Can you spot me 10?

431
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,215
I'll pay you, like, Tuesday and shit.

432
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,695
Thank you.

433
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,924
"Shebanga. " Who is it?

434
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:16,594
- Kevin, I think you need to come out here a minute.
- Hide the shit.

435
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,467
- Oh, man. It reeks in here.
- Shit.

436
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,767
Slater, get up.

437
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:25,402
Kevin, there's someone out here
who says he needs to talk to you.

438
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:27,412
Here. What about?

439
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:30,039
Go get the door man. Here.

440
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,311
- Slater, lose it.
- Kevin, open the door.

441
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,785
- Quick!
- Lose it, man. Damn.

442
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,388
Hey, Dad, Ma. What's up?

443
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,256
- Did you order some kegs of beer?
- No.

444
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,627
Well, there's a fella in a beer truck
out on the street that says you did.

445
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,461
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

446
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,967
Just a sec.

447
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,974
Shit.

448
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,168
- That guy said I ordered a keg of beer?
- Yeah.

449
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,044
He said it was to be delivered
to the Pickford residence.

450
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,208
- This address?
- This address.

451
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:09,118
That's kind of funny. Why don't I
go out there and see what's goin' on?

452
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:11,190
Yeah. I think you better.

453
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,759
I'll be right back.

454
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,953
You guys know anything
about a party here tonight?

455
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,528
- No, sir.
- No.

456
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,665
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

457
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,867
Hey, man.

458
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,035
- Aren't you a little bit early?
- Uh ?

459
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,979
Yeah. About an hour and a half.

460
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,549
But, see, I wanted to get here
early, see if anyone's here.

461
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:43,020
- I got this little action happening tonight, man, if you know what I mean.
- So I guess you got the wrong house.

462
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,624
Oh.

463
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:51,186
Yeah. Inconvenience for you. I'm sorry.
Uh, wrong Mr. Pickford all together.

464
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,891
Hey. These things happen.
Don't worry about it, Ben.

465
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,968
Yeah.

466
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,137
Were you going to have a
party here tonight, Son?

467
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,573
I don't know what that was all about.

468
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,839
Start unpacking. We're
not goin' anywhere.

469
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,039
Frank?

470
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,117
- Fucker!
- Frank?

471
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,329
Oh, look out! Look out! Look out! Aaah!

472
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,961
Hey, batter, batter, batter, swing!

473
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,169
Strike two!

474
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,180
Time.

475
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:27,209
Kramer, one more pitch. You better get this
kid out or we're really gonna beat your ass.

476
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,689
We're gonna beat you
like a running mule.

477
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:36,160
Hey, man. Forget about those guys.
Let's just get this last guy out, okay?

478
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,162
Easy for your ass to say.

479
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,324
- Hey, man. There's nothing you can do about it.
- I'll beat you too.

480
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:43,766
- How'd they all know I was gonna be here?
- Hey, Kramer!

481
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,929
Quit stallin'! Let's go,
baby! We're waiting for you!

482
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,701
I hope you got more than a jockstrap
under there, you little rat!

483
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:53,006
Just because you're not gonna be able to sit down for the
rest of the summer, don't let it affect your concentration.

484
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,012
- Up yours.
- Hey, Mitch.

485
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,572
Could you do the rest of us a favor and
leave through the gate in right field?

486
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,585
That'll draw them all out of here.

487
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,746
I mean, they're gonna get you anyway.

488
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,358
Yeah. Get out of here.

489
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:10,395
- Who are you, buddy?
- What are you looking at? Keep your head in the game. Concentrate!

490
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:31,174
Strike three! Ball game!

491
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:51,398
Good game. Good game. Good
game. Good game. Good game.

492
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:55,565
- Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. Right.
- Good game. Good game.

493
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,100
Yeah, right. Good game.
Good game, man. Good game.

494
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,738
Oh, yeah. Good game. Good game.

495
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:06,341
Way to go, buddy. Way to go.

496
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,420
Way to go.

497
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,546
Come here, man!

498
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,556
Mitchy.

499
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:16,958
- Oh, what happened to your buds?
- Aw, you're all alone.

500
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:19,327
- Hey, Mi ?Oh.
- Oh.

501
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:22,924
- Hey, Mitch. Mitch! Hey!
- Kramer.

502
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:27,638
- How's your dad doing?
- Uh, he's doing great.

503
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,774
This arm ready to throw
about 2,000 yards next fall?

504
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:35,109
Oh. I don't know. We'll see.

505
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,774
We're depending on you boys.

506
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:41,012
And let me tell you
what. You're looking good.

507
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,180
Thirteen starters coming
back. Twenty-two lettermen.

508
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,851
- Lookin' tough.
- Yeah.

509
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,260
- Well, uh, you folks take care.
- Okay. Good to see you, Randy.

510
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,339
Whoa!

511
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,467
Oh, God! You know that hurt!
You know that hurt him, man.

512
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:14,307
- What's goin' on here?
- Oh, Pink, man. You missed it. Whoo!

513
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,677
- What's up, buddy?
- Where you guys headed off to now?

514
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,081
- We're going up to the Emporium. Gonna join us?
- Yeah. See you up there.

515
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,688
You should sign my paddle later.

516
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,882
- I gotta get seconds with him.
- Wait, wait, wait.

517
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:28,085
- This is just too slick.
- You next, Pink?

518
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:31,493
- Sure.
- All right. Say, you already got the kid.

519
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:35,431
All right. Fuck it. You know what? I'm gonna
go find your little skinny partner Carl...

520
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:38,595
and his mom, and let me tell you
something, I took it easy on you.

521
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:42,265
All right? Yeah. You're not smiling
now, are you? You little sack of shit.

522
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,309
Huh? Huh?

523
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,471
- Benny, Don.
- Say, man.

524
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,174
- Bummer about Pickford's party, huh?
- Yeah.

525
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:55,050
Yeah. His old man found
out. Total rip-off, man.

526
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,125
Hey, man. You know, us ?We
got a few sixers. You with us?

527
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,256
Uh, yeah. I gotta go home and
change. I'll catch up with you, okay?

528
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,233
All right. See you later. Hey,
kid. Take care of that butt.

529
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,463
- Say, guys. Hold up.

530
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,337
You need a ride?

531
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:22,573
Yeah. Uh...

532
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,980
I think they left me.

533
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:29,421
Here you go, man.

534
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:48,402
Yeah, there's always one
senior who has to be the badass.

535
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:54,942
I think O'Bannion's gonna be the first senior
in history to take that honor two years in a row.

536
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,811
Guy's a dick. Right?

537
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:02,485
Yeah. He's, uh, kind of a joke.

538
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,853
He's not a bad guy to have on
your side, though, blocking for ya.

539
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,620
Yeah.

540
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,390
Did you get it bad when
you were a freshman?

541
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:14,091
Shit, man. Aw.

542
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,601
They waited for my ass after
baseball practice and got me.

543
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:20,536
God, it was vicious.

544
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,438
I mean, actually, it is best to
get a lot at once, you know...

545
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:27,740
'cause after about 10 licks, your ass gets
so numb, you might as well get it over with.

546
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:32,077
I had some pretty cool
seniors though, you know.

547
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:35,153
They'd take you out and bust
the hell out of you and then...

548
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,154
go get you drunk.

549
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,157
- You know, stuff like that.
- Cool.

550
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:48,296
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Take care, man.

551
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:55,098
Uh, hey, man. Uh, look. Since
the party's not goin' on...

552
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:59,541
me and some of the other guys will
probably end upjust riding around.

553
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:02,170
You want us to stop by and pick you up?

554
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,717
- Well, do you think that's a good idea?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, man. No problem.

555
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:10,221
Even after you've gotten it bad, the guys who
haven't got you yet will give you a few days to rest.

556
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:14,782
It, uh ?It'd be a pretty cool move to show up
and let 'em know it doesn't bother you that much.

557
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:17,260
Yeah, okay. Cool.

558
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,854
- See you later?
- Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the ride, man.

559
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,698
Hey, man. Uh, put some
ice on it for a while.

560
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,533
After that it won't be anything
a few beers can't take care of.

561
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,152
Like, what did she say?
I'm just interested.

562
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:16,346
I think it's funny.
What did she call me?

563
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:20,118
You hang out with her. You know it. We
know they talk about us. Just tell us.

564
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,126
- Nothing.
- We don't care.

565
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:26,289
Oh, come on. Nothing. That's a lie when
you do that. I know you're lying, you bitch.

566
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,389
- I know you're lying.
- You're not gonna get mad?

567
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:31,595
I'm not gonna get mad. I think it's
a riot. I don't care what she thinks.

568
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,571
All right. She called you
a bitch and you a slut.

569
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,870
A slut? She called me a
slut? That bitch. I can't ?

570
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:40,104
- Everybody calls you a slut.
- Shavonne!

571
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,908
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, that bitch. I'm gonna kick her ass.

572
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,006
I can't believe that. What a bitch.

573
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,950
- I thought you said you weren't gonna get mad.
- I'm not mad.

574
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,594
- Look. I got a confession to make.
- What do you mean a confession?

575
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,757
For the, like, last year or so I've
been talking about going to law school...

576
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:05,735
so I can be an A.C.L.U. Lawyer and be in a
position to help people who are getting fucked over.

577
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,035
- Uh-huh. - Well, I was standing in line
at the post office yesterday, you know.

578
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,735
And I'm looking around. And
everybody's looking really pathetic.

579
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,280
You know what I mean? I mean, like,
people had ?like, got drool just sort of?

580
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,975
Then this guy's bending over.
You could see the crack of his ?

581
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,711
It was, like, wife beaters.
It was Anyway, it was ?

582
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,948
And I realized I just don't want
to do it. You know what I mean?

583
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:28,550
It sounds good, but I have to confront the fact that I
don't like the people I've been talking about helping out.

584
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,789
You know what I'm ?I don't think I
like people, period. You guys are okay.

585
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,990
I'm just trying to be honest
about being a misanthrope.

586
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,067
So you're not gonna go to law school?

587
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:38,898
What do you want to do then?

588
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,904
I want to dance.

589
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,445
All right. Let's rock and roll.

590
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,317
Hey. Hop in, man.

591
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,547
Hey, man. Whose car?

592
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,850
- You know Wooderson?
- How's it goin', man?

593
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,086
Hey. Pretty good.
How's it goin' with you?

594
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:07,459
Say, man. You got a joint?

595
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,625
Uh, no. Not on me, man.

596
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,265
It'd be a lot cooler if you did.

597
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:25,243
All right, all right, all right.

598
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:29,253
Hey, man. You still driving in to Houston in
the morning to get those Aerosmith tickets?

599
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:31,255
Ooh, you're damn right.

600
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:33,848
- Evenin', ladies. Ow!
- Nice.

601
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,723
- Need me to pick you up a couple?
- Yeah. Two.

602
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,729
Cool.

603
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,360
- Hey, man. You sure I'm okay in here?
- Yeah, man. You'll be okay.

604
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,199
Look. If anyone starts messing
with you, just play it cool.

605
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,163
- One to go.

606
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:23,173
"Prickford. "

607

"Wood-a-been.
"Happening?

608
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,869
It's a bummer about your party, man.

609
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:30,346
What can I say? It's beyond
me. The delivery guy bricked.

610
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:32,713
And it's a ?Keep your eye on the ball ?

611
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:34,115
dead issue!

612
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,153
- Hey, man. How's it going?
- Good. What's goin' on?

613
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,347
- Nothin'.
- Not much?

614
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,855
- Nothing at all.
- Hey.

615
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,188

00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,866
- I don't know, man. Are you okay?
- Oh. Yeah.

618
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:52,136
Oh. I guess I'll see
you guys a little later.

619
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,865
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Okay. See you.

620
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:06,913
Hey, man. What grade's she in?

621
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,044
Sophomore.

622
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,054
- Come on. Come on.

623
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,784

purple coming in on Sunday. - Donny.

625
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:20,098

626
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:23,691
Oh, God. Hold onto this.
Tight. Lookin' good.

627
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:28,038
Yeah. Yeah.

Nice tongue!

630
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,036
- Who painted 'em?
- Mostly Michelle.

631
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:37,672
Ah!

632
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,842
- Hey. I got an idea.
- What?

633
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:42,420
- A beer bust later on.
- Hey, man.

634
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:45,354
Pickford's got a doob we're
about to burn. Are you with us?

635
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,925
Think about it. Yeah.

636
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:49,961
Are you cool, man?

637
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,530

- Here you go.

653
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,962
Hey. It's the chicks. Shavonne

Watch me get a little something going
right here. Hey. What's going on?

656
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:10,003
- There may be a beer bust later on.
- Oh, really?

657
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:12,009
- Yeah.

- What are you talkin' about?
- "Check you later. " "Check you later. "

662
00:45:22,588 --> 00:45:24,556
Hey, man. Get off my case, man.

663
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:27,523
Oh, man. Chicks don't
want to hear that shit.

664
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:29,617
Well, they don't want
to hear anything, man.

665
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:33,494
The g The girls, man, in our
classes ?They're all prudes, man.

666
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,726
- They're worthless little bitches, man.
- Oh, my God ?

667
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,962
It's the girls ahead of us. They were
wild. Our class is just worthless.

668
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:42,973
Maybe you've just never gotten past the sniffing
butt stage. That's what that sounds like to me.

669
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:46,272
Hey, man. It's ?It's quality,
not quantity. All right, man?

gonna do is bang, bang, bang, bang.

672
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,401
Hey, Hirshfelder. Let's go. Come on.

673
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:23,538
Yeah. Let's go. Let's get out of here.

674
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:25,776
- Let's go.
- Come on, man!

675
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,580
- What?
- It's time to leave.

676
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:31,053
I'll be right back.

677
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:43,224
Hey. You boys leave,
you can't come back.

678
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:45,895
Aw, gee. You hear that?

679
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,097
If we leave, we can't come back.

680
00:46:48,207 --> 00:46:50,107
Oh, no!

681
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:52,234
What should we do?

682
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:57,509
What the hell are we
doing? I was gettin' there.

683
00:46:57,616 --> 00:46:59,516
Man, I had my hand up her shirt.

684
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:02,348
- Oh, yeah.
- You were gettin' there?

685
00:47:02,454 --> 00:47:04,615
You hear that? He was gettin' there.

686
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:10,094
Son, you wouldn't know what to do with it even
if you had gotten there. So don't worry about it.

687
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,629
- Just 'cause you guys are striking out.
- Grow up, boy.

688
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:15,097
- That was our last junior high party.
- That's right.

689
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,000
We're in the big time now. We're freshmen,
where all the girls will be putting out.

690
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:22,005
Your days of lying around and
pulling tongue all night are over.

691
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:24,007
Yeah, right.

692
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,753
- You didn't know she stuffs her bra?
- Terry stuffs her bra?

693
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:46,626
- You didn't know those were socks? Shit.
- Yeah.

694
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,700
They looked real to me.

695
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:55,038
- Oh, shit.
- Scatter!

696
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:03,113

Get over here. Where

00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,489
We ain't gonna hurt you ?much.

703
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,625
Just hold onto that fence there, all
right, and just squeal like a pig.

704
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:27,805
- You ready to
switch-hit? - Oh, yeah.

705
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,636
I'm first.

706
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:40,214
Geez. Bastards.

707
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,150
Hey, you guys.

708
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,330

- Ladies.

711
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,703
One more for my mother.

712
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:03,532
Hey. Who is that kid?

713
00:49:03,642 --> 00:49:07,908
What? That kid there? Just some kid we saw running
around that shouldn't have been, by the rec center.

714
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:10,243
Hey. Can we have some of those beers?

715
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:13,182
- One of these?
- Yeah.

716
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:15,753
- Why?

Tubbs, catch. Good. Get out ofhere.

720
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:26,026
- What are you wasting a beer on him for?
- What?

721
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:29,693
- It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
- Give 'em a beer.

722
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,769
Man, this fuckin' sucks. All right?

723
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,169
Last fuckin' day of school.
No fuckin' party. No fuckin' ?

724
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,470
- You just wasted another fuckin' beer.
- Oh, shut up.

725
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:41,478
Thanks.

726
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,912
- Hmm.
- Hey.

727
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,650
So, which one of your friends
bought you the beer this time?

728
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:51,655
- Right.
- Hey! Fuck her! I did!

729
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:54,885
- Yeah, bite me!
- You wish, asshole!

730
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,893
Fuck you!

731
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,725
Why are guys such pigs?

732
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,731
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

733
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,393
Mmm. We're out of here.

734
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:07,472
Let me tell you what Melba
Toast is packin'right here.

735
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,668
We got 411 positrack out back, 750
double pumper, Edelbrock intakes...

736
00:50:11,777 --> 00:50:16,680
Ford over-30, 11-to-1 pop-up
pistons, Turbo-jet 390 horsepower.

737
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,977
We're talkin' some fuckin' muscle.

738
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:21,848
Hey, man, I know you got this
thing out of a comic book.

739
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:24,854
I saw the ad ?2.95. It was
right next to the sea monkeys.

740
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:26,856
You see that over there?
That's white lightning.

741
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,984
You see the shoes on that thing? You gotta
get some tires. These are pizza cutters.

742
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:34,588
Yeah.

743
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,031
- Ow.
- You're such an expert.

744
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:39,831
This is sad. Shouldn't we
be doing something else?

745
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:41,838
Yeah. Like what?

746
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,840
- I'm bored.
- You're always bored.

747
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:45,671
- Let's split.
- Where you wanna go?

748
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:47,301
Then you're boring.

749
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:49,312
- Pink!
- Hey.

750
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,905
Hey. You hear anything
more about a beer bust?

751
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:55,612
- Talk to this man right here.
- Patience, darlin', patience.

752
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,620
- Hey.
- Hey.

753
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:02,182
- What are you doing here?
- I was just about to ask you the same question.

754
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:04,455
- I heard you got busted.
- Oh, yeah.

755
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,463
They just got Hirshfelder too.

756
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,055
- Really?
- Yeah.

757
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,134
- Like, how bad?
- Bad.

758
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,870
- Was it O'Bannion?
- Yeah.

759
00:51:13,972 --> 00:51:16,372
God, I hate that jerk.

760
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:18,534
I know.

761
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:21,203
So, um ?

762
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:23,508
What have you guys been doin'? Just ?

763
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:26,709
I don't know. Driving around, mostly.

764
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:29,048
I didn't know thatJodi
was your big sister.

765
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:31,554
- Oop.
- Hey, did I hear my name over here?

766
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,420
You guys talkin' about me? Hey, kiddo.

767
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,085
Heard they got you pretty bad.

768
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:41,825
And I asked them to take it easy on
you. I can't believe they did that.

769
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,401
Man! God! No wonder!

770
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:49,065
Pink, what happened?

771
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:51,074
So, where'd they find Hirsh?

772
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:54,077
I don't know. Walking out
of the rec center, I think.

773
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,079
- Hey.

774
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,673
- What have you guys been doin'?
- Pink, right?

775
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,086
Hi!

776
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:05,088
Ohh!

777
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,158
Hi.

778
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,296
Whew.

779
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:15,833
Face it. You got busted
because you couldn't get away.

780
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:17,902
You try and outrun
O'Bannion and those guys.

781
00:52:18,003 --> 00:52:21,564
I'm gonna be laughin' my ass off when it's
your turn, when they're busting your ass.

782
00:52:21,673 --> 00:52:24,005
Hey, man, I heard last year...

783
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:26,270
they caught about 10 freshmen at once.

784
00:52:26,378 --> 00:52:29,279
O'Bannion backed his truck over
some pizzas and made 'em eat it, man.

785
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:31,281
I mean, that's bullshit. Right?

786
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:34,284
Idiot flunks his senior year so he
can be a dick two years in a row?

787
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:36,286
Is that legal?

788
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:38,356
Damn you, Carl!

789
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:47,297
Ohh! Okay. Let me out.

790
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:50,732
Hey, Slater, you fuckin'
hippie! Give me drugs, man!

791
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,303
Get some from your mother, man.

792
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:56,306
- Yeah, we just banged your mother.
- Okay. Fuck you, dickhead.

793
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,813
Those guys, man. Man of the woods. What's
goin' on? God, I haven't seen you in so long.

794
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:04,814
My man, what is happenin'?

795
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,282
Long time no see.

796
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,320
- What have you been up to?
- Same old shit, man.

797
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:12,754
- Workin' for the city.
- Workin' man, huh?

798
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,690
Been thinkin' about gettin'
back in school though, man.

799
00:53:15,794 --> 00:53:18,126
- Back in J.C., somethin' like that?
- Yeah, man.

800
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:21,630
I mean, that's where
all the girls are, right?

801
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,634
But on the other hand, man,
I'd just as soon keep workin'.

802
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:27,637
- Keep a little change in my pocket.
- Yeah? Wait.

803
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:31,641
Rather than spend my time listenin' to some dipshit
who doesn't know what he's talkin' about anyway.

804
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:33,711
I know what you're talkin' about.

805
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,880
- Say, you're a freshman, right?
- Yeah.

806
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:40,884
All right, so tell me, man. How's this
year's crop of freshman chicks lookin'?

807
00:53:42,988 --> 00:53:46,389
Wood, you're gonna end up in jail sometime
really soon. I know that for a fact.

808
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:48,891
No, man. No, let me tell you.

809
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:53,260
That's what I love about
these high school girls, man.

810
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:56,163
I get older, they stay the same age.

811
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:58,167
Yes, they do.

812
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,169
Yes, they do.

813
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,638
- You guys wanna go for a spin?
- Shotgun!

814
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:05,710
Aw.

815
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:08,574
- Woods.
- I'm here, man.

816
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,580
You wanna come along?

817
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:12,582
Yeah. Why not?

818
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:15,812
- Take care, bro.
- You boys have fun now.

819
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,650
Listen, I'm gonna give you shotgun.

820
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:22,454
But I want you to know it's because
?only 'cause I'm goin' inside.

821
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,859
- Keep that in mind. All right?
- Okay. Got it.

822
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:32,059
- Hey, man, whose bowling ball is this?
- It's yours, man.

823
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,570
- Slater.
- Hey, man. What's happening?

824
00:54:34,673 --> 00:54:36,800
- Play a little foosball?
- Yeah!

825
00:54:57,195 --> 00:54:59,026
Junior.

826
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:05,727
Pull over to the trash can.

827
00:55:05,837 --> 00:55:08,738
Pull over to the trash can!
Pull over to the trash can!

828
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,364
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme ?

829
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:22,885
Okay. Okay. Oh!

830
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,716
Shit, yeah!

831
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:31,259
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

832
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,489
Hey, you guys, pull over
to that one over there.

833
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:35,657
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Here, hold this. Hold this.

834
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:43,301
- I got it! Go! Go!
- Guess what.

835
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:45,808
It's garbage day!

836
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:49,609
Yeah!

837
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:52,683
We're fuckin'runnin'!

838
00:55:53,952 --> 00:55:56,250
Yeah! Whoo!

839
00:55:56,354 --> 00:56:00,188
- Whoo!
- Oh, my?

840
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,192
Bowling ball.

841
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:05,262
- Yeah!
- Throw the bowling ball.

842
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:07,331
Think I should?

843
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:09,696
- Yeah! Throw it!
- Throw it! Throw it!

844
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:12,326
Come on. You're playin'with

Do it! Throw it! Faggot-sissy-pussy

846
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,605
- Throw it!

847
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:25,582
Fuck 'em!

848
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:30,347
That bowling ball said "Oof!"
To that damn windshield!

849
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:33,481
- Yeah! - Ha-ha!
You're nuts, junior!

850
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,491
You're nuts!

851
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,493
Hey, man, we're out ofbeer.

852
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,621
- We gotta make a Grab-'N'-
Go stop. - Fuck that.

853
00:56:40,732 --> 00:56:43,257
- I don't have any money. Who's got money?
- I gave mine to him.

854
00:56:43,368 --> 00:56:45,268
Where's your money? Nah, doesn't matter.

855
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,531
Pull in heading out that way.

856
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,070
- What are you gonna do, man? Hoist it?
- Yeah. That all I ever do.

857
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,581
- I just need the freshman as a lookout.
- I don't wanna get in trouble. Do you, Randall Pink?

858
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:01,151
- I don't know about this, Don.
- Come on.

859
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,389
I don't wanna see you.

860
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,755
Better be careful, junior.

861
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,456
- Sunflower seeds.
- Zigzags!

862
00:57:12,564 --> 00:57:15,533
- Zigzags.
- Hey, man, I'm not too sure about this.

863
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,966
Shh. I'm really gonna pay for it. I'm
just messin' around with them. Okay?

864
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:22,039
Good.

865
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,822
Run! Go, go, go, go, go!

866
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,553
Come on, guys! We gotta get

868
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:48,966
All right, now don't try anything,

869
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:52,867
- Don, give the beer back, man.
- I paid for the beer, man.

870
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,402
Busted my mailbox, didn't you?

871
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,475
Look me in the eye, punk!

872
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:02,068
I don't know what you're talking
about, sir, but I suggest that you ?

873
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,943
You busted it, didn't ya?

874
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:11,322
Tamperin' with mailboxes
is a felony offense.

875
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:15,820
- I done called the police.

876
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:18,623
I think you boys oughta
get out of the car.

877
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,722
- Just go, man.
- Nice and slow.

878
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,758
Go, go, go!

879
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,969
Whoo!

880
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:31,602
Get down!

881
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:33,973
He's shooting at us! Holy?

882
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,643
Fairly uneventful, huh?

883
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,487
Which one of you had the theory...

884
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:47,490
about how President Ford's
old football head injuries...

885
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:49,492
is affecting the economy?

886
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:52,995
- Did you know Ford was on the Warren Commission?
- Who cares? He's out of there this fall.

887
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:54,997
Look, we need some alcohol.

888
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,590
That's a thought.

889
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:25,795
Say, man.

890
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:29,128
Why don't you run over to the Centennial
and pick me up a sixer of this stuff.

891
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,724
Think you can do that?

892
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:34,937
- Thanks, man.
- Good luck!

893
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:40,641
I'm just saying, if we're gonna drive
around, we should just do something ?Ohh!

894
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,645
Yeah. You know, you're right, man.

895
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:47,650
I'm just gonna, you know, get drunk,
maybe get laid, or get in a fight.

896
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,186
No, I'm serious, man! We
should be up for anything!

897
00:59:50,288 --> 00:59:52,188
I know. We are. But what?

898
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:56,727
I mean, God, don't you ever feel like everything
we do and everything we've been taught...

899
00:59:56,828 --> 00:59:58,728
is just to service the future?

900
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,094
Yeah, I know. It's like
it's all preparation.

901
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:03,997
Right. But what are we
preparing ourselves for?

902
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:06,229
- Death.
- Life of the party.

903
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,237
It's true.

904
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,239
You know, but that's valid.

905
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:14,243
Because if we're all gonna die anyway,
shouldn't we be enjoying ourselves now?

906
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:17,337
You know? I'd like to quit thinking
of the present ?like, right now ?

907
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:21,077
as some minor, insignificant
preamble to somethin' else.

908
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:26,748
Exactly! That's what everybody in this car needs
?some good old, worthwhile visceral experience.

909
01:00:27,859 --> 01:00:30,919
Remember to eat a green thing every day.

910
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:32,929
And have lots of calcium.

911
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:36,432
It's very important for young
mothers to have lots of calcium.

912
01:00:36,534 --> 01:00:39,594
- There you are. See you tomorrow night.
- Bye.

913
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:43,299
- How are you this evening?
- Pretty good. How's it goin'?

914
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:46,309
Be goin' a lot better when I
get off in a couple of hours.

915
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:48,379
Yeah, I hear that.

916
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,008
- You're 18, right?
- Oh, yeah.

917
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,646
- Just graduated.
- Graduated. Congratulations.

918
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:03,056
- So, you off to college in the fall?
- Uh, you know, I'm still not sure.

919
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:05,527
I'm workin' right now for the city.

920
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:11,066
Thinkin' of holding on to the job for a
while. You know, it's money in my pocket.

921
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:13,933
I hear that. Here's some
more money for your pocket.

922
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,802
- You have a nice night tonight.
- Okay. Thanks.

923
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:19,376
Hey, take it easy.

924
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:23,570
Psst! Hey, Mitch.

925
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:27,650
Hey. There you guys are.

926
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:30,778
- Hey, man, what's in the bag?
- Ah, a sixer.

927
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,822
- You owe me one, man.
- Yeah.

928
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:34,892
They busted the hell
out of Hirshfelder too.

929
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:37,859
- Yeah, I heard.
- Hey, man, you're over at the Emporium?

930
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:41,762
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, is that bastard O'Bannion over there?

931
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:44,960
Yes. I hate that jerk.

932
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,831
Do you guys wanna get him back?

933
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,373
- Hell yes.
- Yeah!

934
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,477
They really sold it to you?

935
01:02:01,586 --> 01:02:03,554
- Of course.
- Cool.

936
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,325
There you go, buddy.

937
01:02:10,428 --> 01:02:13,192
Whoo! Paycheck. Oh, yeah.

938
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:15,697
- Way to shoot, man.
- Thanks, bud.

939
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,701
Oh, yeah. He got it.

940
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:21,704
- I got your change.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.

941
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:24,206
- Got a beer for my partner.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:26,208
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

943
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,210
- All right.
- Guys.

944
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,712
- Party at the moon tower.
- Oh, I'm there.

945
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:33,875
You and Benny pick up the first keg.
I'm goin' to collect for the rest.

946
01:02:33,985 --> 01:02:35,885
Spread the word, man.

947
01:02:35,987 --> 01:02:37,887
Max, Phil, party at the moon tower.

948
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:40,651
Hey, good game, man. You too.

949
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,158
Y'all are an embarrassment
to the sport of pool...

950
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:46,355
and you should be proud that I
even let you play at my table.

951
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:49,365
You are the worst pool player
I've ever seen in my life...

952
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:52,698
but if you keep watchin'me
you might learn somethin'!

953
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,931
Shit, you got so many balls on the table, I'm
gonna have to start knockin'your balls in...

954
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,940
just to get 'em out of my way.

955
01:02:58,042 --> 01:02:59,942
- Okay.
- Corner pocket.

956
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:01,944
- Hey, check this out.
- Easy money.

957
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,946
God, you are terrible!

958
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:08,747
Okay, homo, I hope you are ready to taste
the agonizing, bitter humiliation of defeat.

959
01:03:08,853 --> 01:03:10,753
You ready?

960
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:13,756
So, did you hear they're
busting Carl Burnett out back?

961
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:15,758
- Whoa-whoa. What did
you say? - About what?

962
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,352
- Carl Burnett. What about him?
- I just heard he's gettin' busted. I don't know.

963
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,363
Benny, they got Burnett
in the back. Let's go.

964
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,228
- Carl Burnett? Outside?
- Yeah. They got him.

965
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:25,234
- Let's go.
- Let me finish this game.

966
01:03:25,336 --> 01:03:27,236
- Fine. I'm gettin' out.
- Hold him for me!

967
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,203
All right, all right!

968
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:33,844
Hey, man. ThatJulie chick? Loves you.

969
01:03:33,945 --> 01:03:35,845
Oh, yeah. You want her?

970
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:38,848
Gotta play it cool, you know. Can't
let her know how much you like her.

971
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,851
'Cause if she knows, she'll
dump you like that. Believe me.

972
01:03:41,953 --> 01:03:46,720
If she asks you to ride out there with her,
you don't do it. Say, "Nah. Got my own ride.

973
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,724
But maybe I'll see you later. "

974
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:51,056
Sounds stupid, doesn't it? It works.

975
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,892
Whoo-ee! Whee! We got
another one, huh, fellas?

976
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:57,900
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Guys, guys. You
wouldn't mind if I went first, would ya?

977
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,902
Is that all right?

978
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:03,838
It's kind of a personal thing between
me and this little piece of shit here.

979
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,842
So... we meet again, huh?

980
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:12,075
Did y'all hear this little motherfucker's
mom pulled a shotgun on me this afternoon?

981
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,083
Fuckin' bitch.

982
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:16,517
Y
- You haven't had any licks yet, have you?

983
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:18,521
- Hmm?
- No.

984
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:21,490
Whoo! Another cherry, boys.

985
01:04:21,592 --> 01:04:23,719
Man, get the fuck up against the wall!

986
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:27,764
You have to be the dumbest freshman,
skinny little cocksucking son of a bitch...

987
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,299
to be out here tonight.

988
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:32,301
You knew I was gonna find you.

989
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:35,304
I would like to dedicate
this first lick...

990
01:04:35,406 --> 01:04:37,499
to your mother...

991
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:39,576
fucker.

992
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,380
Not yet.

993
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:46,382
Oh! It's gettin' warmer.

994
01:04:46,484 --> 01:04:48,452
What the fuck?

995
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,958
Remember me, you pig?

996
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:02,461
#I walked through the halls ofkarma #

997
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,466
Let's go, man! Come on!

998
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,594
What the fuck is the matter with
you? How 'bout some fucking backup?

999
01:05:07,705 --> 01:05:09,605
- Let's go!
- I'm hurryin'!

1000
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:11,607
Fuckin'scumbags!

1001
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:14,906
It was beautiful! You should have
seen the look on that fuck's face!

1002
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:16,912
- Get in!
- We got that bastard!

1003
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:24,113
Jesus! You let that
little fuck get away!

1004
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,917
What is the matter with
you? It's fuckin' pitiful!

1005
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,083
Fuck!

1006
01:05:29,193 --> 01:05:31,559
Freshman shitheads.

1007
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:34,324
What the fuck are you lookin' at? Huh?

1008
01:05:34,432 --> 01:05:36,900
I'll kick your fuckin' ass right now!

1009
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:40,069
Pussy.

1010
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:48,608
What are you smilin' at, you
little freshman faggot? Huh?

1011
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:52,542
Fuck you.

1012
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,948
Fuck all of you! Fuck you!

1013
01:05:57,188 --> 01:05:59,156
Goddamn it!

1014
01:06:05,563 --> 01:06:07,463
Oh, man!

1015
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:11,160
O'Bannion finally got
his paint job Whoa!

1016
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,380
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1017
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,882
I swore to God I'd never
come to a Top Notch...

1018
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:30,420
and here I am sorting through
jalapeo burgers and soggy fries.

1019
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,421
Here, take 'em.

1020
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:36,289
- All right, all right!
- Oh, Christ.

1021
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:39,522
How ya doin'?

1022
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:42,155
- Pretty good.
- Cool.

1023
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:44,700
You heard about the
party bein' busted, right?

1024
01:06:44,802 --> 01:06:47,703
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Not to worry.

1025
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,706
There's a new fiesta in
the making as we speak.

1026
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,708
It's out at the moon tower.

1027
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,405
Full kegs. Everybody's gonna
be there. You oughta go.

1028
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:58,414
Okay.

1029
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:00,347
- Okay, we'll be there.
- Okay.

1030
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,113
- Say, you need a ride?
- Uh, no, I got my own car.

1031
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,120
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well, listen.

1032
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:08,123
You oughta ditch the two geeks you're
in the car with now and get in with us.

1033
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:11,126
But that's all right. We'll
worry about that later.

1034
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:14,857
- I will see you there. All right?
- Bye.

1035
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:17,297
I love those redheads, man.

1036
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,801
I know you!

1037
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:22,532
We had geography together. Remember?

1038
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,837
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God.

1039
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:27,843
What a dick!

1040
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:30,345
That was so creepy.

1041
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:33,349
- Why are you smiling?
- I thought he was cute.

1042
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,851
- Oh, that's disgusting!
- You thought he was cute?

1043
01:07:35,953 --> 01:07:38,854
Do you realize when he graduated
we were, like, three years old?

1044
01:07:38,956 --> 01:07:42,084
Oh, Cynthia, what are you thinking?

1045
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:44,093
I don't know.

1046
01:07:44,195 --> 01:07:47,096
So, are we gonna still go?

1047
01:07:47,198 --> 01:07:49,291
- Yeah, what the hell.
- I guess.

1048
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,708
Ohh! Get back!

1049
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:15,324
Hey, Wood is here for
the quarter race, baby!

1050
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:18,259
- Hey, Benny. You better have your wood screws ?
- Fuck you!

1051
01:08:18,362 --> 01:08:20,990
'Cause I'm gonna blow
your doors completely off!

1052
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:57,727
Yeah!

1053
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:37,906
Well, someone's tokin' some reefer.

1054
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,010
Take care of this.

1055
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:44,239
Hey, man. Hey. Slow down. What's up?

1056
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,816
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- What'd you just say?

1057
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,475
When?

1058
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:52,078
Just now, man, when you
walked past. What'd you say?

1059
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,679
A
- About what?

1060
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:57,317
You said, "Someone's
tokin' some reefer. "

1061
01:09:57,428 --> 01:10:00,420
No, I may have said something
about smelling some pot.

1062
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,261
- You know, it was just an observation.
- Oh, an observation, huh?

1063
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:06,359
Well, who the hell are you,
man? Isaac fuckin' Newton?

1064
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,337
Well, guess what, genius. I'm the
one smoking marijuana, motherfucker.

1065
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,704
- You got a problem with that?
- No. Of course not.

1066
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:16,610
Then why'd you say that, chief? Don't let
your mouth write a check your butt can't cash.

1067
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:19,148
So I'm blazin' with my friends.
So I'm a fuckin' pothead, man.

1068
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:22,650
What's it to you? Huh? What's the
matter, pussy? Out of observations?

1069
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:25,950
Why don't you observe while I punch
your teeth down your fuckin' throat!

1070
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:28,957
Dude, relax! Relax!
He's cool, man. Relax.

1071
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:32,551
Hey, I'll be watching you, Newton. I
only came here to do two things, man.

1072
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:35,097
Kick some ass and drink some beer.

1073
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,657
Looks like we're almost out of beer.

1074
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:42,000
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

1075
01:10:47,144 --> 01:10:49,544
Why is it called the moon tower, anyway?

1076
01:10:49,647 --> 01:10:55,017
Uh, I guess they decided to put it up out here
whenever they were building the power plant.

1077
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,019
Actually, it's a good idea.

1078
01:10:57,121 --> 01:11:00,522
You got a full moon out here
every day of the year. You know?

1079
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:02,524
Yeah, but nothing's
ever been repaired...

1080
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:05,527
so this whole place could
fall down at any time.

1081
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:07,790
So you'd better watch your step, junior.

1082
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:14,200
This place used to be off limits, man,
'cause of some drunk freshman who fell off.

1083
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:18,035
He went right down the middle,
smackin' his head on every beam, man.

1084
01:11:18,142 --> 01:11:20,770
I hear it doesn't hurt after
the first couple, though.

1085
01:11:20,878 --> 01:11:24,109
Autopsy said he had one beer,
man. How many did you have?

1086
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:26,114
Four.

1087
01:11:26,216 --> 01:11:28,116
You're dead, man. You're so dead.

1088
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:31,381
Look at the bloodstains right there.

1089
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,456
Shut up.

1090
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:37,358
I'm gonna get that guy.

1091
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:40,760
- What guy?
- That asshole on the way in ?Clint.

1092
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:44,265
Super-dominant male in
a '50s greaser uniform.

1093
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:46,268
I wouldn't suggest that, Mike.

1094
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,270
Look, man, I got it all planned out.

1095
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:51,273
Most fights in places like this never get
past a punch or two before they're broken up.

1096
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,276
There's almost a natural
instinct not to upset the herd.

1097
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:57,279
So all I gotta do is get in one
good punch, play defense and wait.

1098
01:11:57,381 --> 01:12:00,282
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1099
01:12:00,384 --> 01:12:03,285
I- I-I guess at first I was relieved
to get out of the situation...

1100
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,787
but now there's this level
of humiliation setting in...

1101
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,289
that I can tell is gonna
be with me for-fucking-ever!

1102
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:10,792
I'm just not gonna let this
be yet another situation...

1103
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:13,988
which contributes to me being a little,
ineffectual nothing the rest of my life.

1104
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:20,168
Would you look at
this fucking town, man.

1105
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,431
It's dead.

1106
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:28,409
Imagine how many people out
there right now are fucking, man.

1107
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,414
Step inside my head ?

1108
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,950
Just goin' at it.

1109
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:40,449
- Hey.
- Hey.

1110
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,957
- Remember me?
- Sure. You're Sabrina, right?

1111
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,652
Right.

1112
01:12:44,762 --> 01:12:46,662
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

1113
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:48,823
- Hey, let's go.
- What brings you here?

1114
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:51,400
Oh, just hanging out.

1115
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:55,834
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

1116
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,839
Yeah.

1117
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:01,502
So, uh ?does your offer from
this afternoon still stand?

1118
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:06,674
What am I say supposed to
say? "Anything you want. "

1119
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:18,026
Why did we even come here?

1120
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:21,029
I always feel a little out of
place at these things, you know.

1121
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:23,622
You're telling me. I'm
being stalked by a Nazi.

1122
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:26,635
Is that a little bit of
reefer I smell on you, boy?

1123
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:29,171
Coach is right. You're runnin'
with that bad crowd again.

1124
01:13:29,273 --> 01:13:32,174
You've got an attitude adjustment
you've gotta make right now.

1125
01:13:32,276 --> 01:13:35,575
Like I'm the only athlete at this
fuckin' party. Look at you two drunks.

1126
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,171
Coach is right, though. Those guys
don't care if we win or lose, bro.

1127
01:13:39,283 --> 01:13:41,649
Just remember that.

1128
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:43,652
- Check this out. Watch this ?
- Yeah?

1129
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:47,190
Watch me get this beer. Watch.

1130
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:49,191
Oh, no! It's the cops!

1131
01:13:49,293 --> 01:13:51,090
- Look! Look!
- Shit!

1132
01:13:51,195 --> 01:13:53,095
Look, look, look! That was so easy.

1133
01:13:53,197 --> 01:13:57,361
Oh, shit. He needs another
drink, you know, bad.

1134
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:10,747
All right!

1135
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,406
Hey! Mitch!

1136
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,409
- Hey!
- How's it goin'?

1137
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,411
I was wondering if you were around here.

1138
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:47,541
Oh, man!

1139
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:51,747
So, uh, I just wanted
to talk, you know...

1140
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:53,823
about you quittin' football.

1141
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:56,925
Or is it just this pledge?

1142
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:59,928
You don't wanna sign the
pledge, right? That's what it is.

1143
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,555
I don't know, man.

1144
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:06,696
Maybe I'm not into any of it anymore.

1145
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:10,573
- You're not into any of it anymore.
- Yeah.

1146
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:16,878
It'd be the biggest mistake of your
life, Pink. No one quits senior year, pal.

1147
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,710
Especially if you're
starting quarterback.

1148
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:22,876
I mean, we got a shot at state.

1149
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:25,454
We'll kick some butt this year.

1150
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:30,126
It's what we've been working
for all of our lives, man.

1151
01:15:30,227 --> 01:15:33,560
Me and you. Benny. We're
gonna be champions together.

1152
01:15:33,664 --> 01:15:38,931
Look, man, all I'm saying is
that if I do play next year...

1153
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:41,937
it's gonna be on my terms, not theirs.

1154
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:44,735
You just remember one thing, Pink?

1155
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:48,709
it ain't just about you, pal,
it's about us ?me, Donny, Mel.

1156
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:51,508
You'd be fuckin' us over.

1157
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:53,674
Or maybe you'rejust fuckin'scared, huh?

1158
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:57,387
Have a nice night.

1159
01:16:41,465 --> 01:16:44,366
Do you guys know what that song's about?

1160
01:16:44,468 --> 01:16:46,436
It's about aliens.

1161
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:51,337
We're the aliens,
man. We're the savages.

1162
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,274
- We're the savages.
- Wait, man. That song is about that?

1163
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:57,211
- Yeah, man, that song's about that.
- About aliens?

1164
01:16:57,314 --> 01:16:59,214
Yeah, man. You didn't know that?

1165
01:16:59,316 --> 01:17:03,514
This country's founded ?It was founded
by people who were into aliens, man.

1166
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:08,250
George Washington, man, he was in a
cult, and the cult was into aliens, man.

1167
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:10,258
- You didn't know that?
- No.

1168
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,885
Oh, man, they were way into
that type of stuff, man.

1169
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:15,624
It's like the every-other-decade
theory. You know?

1170
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:19,293
The '50s were boring, the '60s rocked...

1171
01:17:19,403 --> 01:17:22,031
and the '70s ?Oh, my
God, they obviously suck.

1172
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:24,039
Right? Come on.

1173
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,439
Maybe the '80s will
be radical. You know?

1174
01:17:26,543 --> 01:17:30,035
I figure we'll be in our 20s
and, hey, it can't get any worse.

1175
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:49,898
Wait a minute.

1176
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,400
Who put the keg way
out here in the woods?

1177
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:55,403
I don't know. This is just
where they told me it would be.

1178
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:57,905
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1179
01:17:58,008 --> 01:18:00,476
- Huh.
- I don't think we need beer anyway.

1180
01:18:03,213 --> 01:18:06,011
- George toked weed, man?
- Absolutely, George toked weed.

1181
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:09,017
Are you kidding me, man? He
grew fields of that stuff.

1182
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,019
That's what I'm talking about. Fields!

1183
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:15,080
- He grew that shit up at Mount Vernon, man.
- Mount Vernon? He grew it all over the country.

1184
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:18,093
He had people growin'it
all over the country.

1185
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:21,096
The whole country back then was
gettin'high. Let me tell you, man.

1186
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:23,826
'Cause?'Cause?'Cause he knew.
He was onto somethin', man.

1187
01:18:23,934 --> 01:18:28,166
He knew that it would be a good cash
crop for the Southern states, man...

1188
01:18:28,271 --> 01:18:30,171
so he grew fields of it, man.

1189
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:34,300
But you know what? Behind
every good man there's a woman.

1190
01:18:34,411 --> 01:18:36,311
And that woman was
Martha Washington, man.

1191
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:40,315
And every day, George would come home,
she'd have a big, fat bowl waiting for him...

1192
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:42,317
when he'd come in the door, man.

1193
01:18:42,419 --> 01:18:44,444
She was a hip ?a hip, hip lady, man.

1194
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,365
Mm-mmm. Wait a minute.

1195
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,370
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1196
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:04,702
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1197
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:06,776
Don't you have a girlfriend?

1198
01:19:09,346 --> 01:19:12,611
- What girlfriend?
- What's-her-name.

1199
01:19:12,716 --> 01:19:16,152
Simone. Hmm?

1200
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,590
And she was real cool too.

1201
01:19:22,692 --> 01:19:25,593
She'd harvest the crops, man.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1202
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,596
She'd put it in the ?in the, um,
bushels and stuff and sell it, you know.

1203
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,599
Because they had to
make ends meet and stuff.

1204
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:34,101
I mean, did you ever look
at a dollar bill, man?

1205
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:38,334
There's some spooky stuff going on on
a dollar bill, man. And it's green too!

1206
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,341
- Later.
- See ya.

1207
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:43,344
- Cool.
- Wait, wait, wait. What was that all about?

1208
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,415
- What were you doin' back there, guy?
- Exactly what you two clowns wish you were doin'.

1209
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:48,416
- Look at him.
- Look at your boy.

1210
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,418
Kramer!

1211
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,014
Yeah, you, you, you. Freshman. Right
here. Come on. Right here, buddy.

1212
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:58,720
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. What is this wave shit?

1213
01:19:58,828 --> 01:20:02,025
- Freshman! Over here right now.
- Over here. Now.

1214
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:04,032
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

1215
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:07,035
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Shit. I should go.

1216
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:10,402
- Yeah, I guess you probably should.
- Shit. I'll be back.

1217
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:12,475
Okay.

1218
01:20:12,576 --> 01:20:14,976
- He's like a little Casanova.
- Yeah.

1219
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:17,478
- It's amazing. - Look at this
shit-eating grin on his face.

1220
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:19,981
- Was I right?
- Not bad for a little freshman.

1221
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,483
But you better watch
out for them older girls.

1222
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,486
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come
here, come here, come here.

1223
01:20:24,588 --> 01:20:27,785
All right, all right. We just
wanna know something. Okay?

1224
01:20:27,891 --> 01:20:31,793
Are you gonna be fuckin' that later,
or are you gonna be a little wimp? Huh?

1225
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:34,796
How do you know I haven't already?

1226
01:20:34,898 --> 01:20:37,799
Get outta here! I think
it's past your bedtime!

1227
01:20:37,901 --> 01:20:40,802
- Run along.
- Come here. Come here, come here.

1228
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:44,806
Why don't you go get a ride
with her. Say we left you.

1229
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:47,536
It'll work. It'll work. Go.

1230
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:50,272
- Hey, Kramer. Show it to her.
- Yeah.

1231
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,507
- Give it to her. Go!
- Go, boy.

1232
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,423
Air raid, freshman.

1233
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,425
What?

1234
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,586
Air raid, freshman.

1235
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:09,688
- Oh, come on, Darla. Leave her alone.
- No, Tony, this is between me and her.

1236
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:13,030
And she'd better be on the ground i
- in five seconds.

1237
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:18,106
Wait, she doesn't have to air-raid
because she's with me. Okay?

1238
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:22,277
Air-raid, or it's your ass.

1239
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:24,370
Don't do it, Sabrina.

1240
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:26,381
Oh, that's it...

1241
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:28,951
Miss Hot Stuff.

1242
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:34,879
I'm gonna make the next year
of your life a living hell.

1243
01:21:42,799 --> 01:21:45,029
Lick me! All of you!

1244
01:21:45,135 --> 01:21:47,695
Hey, Darla.

1245
01:21:47,804 --> 01:21:50,534
Good for you.

1246
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,541
Don't air-raid for that
bitch. I hate that shit.

1247
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:56,544
It's like that Clint fucker
in front of all his friends.

1248
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:58,876
- "Huh? Huh, motherfucker?"
- All right! Okay, Mike.

1249
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:00,973
Dominant male monkey motherfucker!

1250
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:03,712
God!

1251
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:06,721
T- A-R-A.

1252
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:10,224
I never met a Tara
before. You're my first.

1253
01:22:10,327 --> 01:22:12,420
Hey, what the ?

1254
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:15,259
All right!

1255
01:22:15,365 --> 01:22:18,528
- He did it! I can't believe it!
- Fuckin' knew I should have kicked your ass!

1256
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:21,297
Come on! Come on, man!

1257
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:23,895
- Come on! Hold still!
- Yeah!

1258
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:27,204
- Stop now!
- Oh, yeah! Hold still!

1259
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,574
- You guys, come on.
- It's that Clint. That crazy bastard.

1260
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,375
- You like this? You like this, motherfucker?
- Come on, Clint! Come on!

1261
01:22:32,482 --> 01:22:35,178
Where you goin'?

1262
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:41,621
Whoo-hoo! Kick his ass!

1263
01:22:41,725 --> 01:22:44,057
Come on, man! You want some
more? You fuckin' bitch!

1264
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,756
Come on, man! Come here!

1265
01:22:48,865 --> 01:22:51,026
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Get off him!

1266
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,762
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on!

1267
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:58,307
- Come on. Stay down!
- Fuckin' dick! You fucking fascist!

1268
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:01,639
You got fuckin' smoked! Come
on, man! You want some more?

1269
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:04,646
Fuckin' dick!

1270
01:23:32,242 --> 01:23:34,142
Hey.

1271
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:37,145
Hey, little brother.

1272
01:23:37,247 --> 01:23:39,647
- Is that a beer in your hand?
- Why, yes, it is.

1273
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:42,149
Have you had more than
one of those tonight?

1274
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:44,812
A few, I guess, but nobody's counting.

1275
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:47,822
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi.

1276
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:52,554
Guess I might as well just get used to you
being at the same social functions as me, huh?

1277
01:23:52,662 --> 01:23:55,062
And, uh, hanging out with people I know?

1278
01:23:55,165 --> 01:23:58,362
What time are you supposed
to be home, anyway?

1279
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:01,369
Oh, geez, I don't
know. Couple hours ago.

1280
01:24:01,471 --> 01:24:03,871
That's bullshit.

1281
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:06,305
That's major bullshit.

1282
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:09,310
Mom barely let me out of the
house when I was your age.

1283
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:11,312
- Aww!
- "Aww!"

1284
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:15,180
Don't think she's not gonna be waiting up for
you when you get home, because she will be.

1285
01:24:15,285 --> 01:24:18,186
- I've been through it, and she's tough.
- Yeah, well ?

1286
01:24:18,288 --> 01:24:21,746
Just don't ask her to
take it easy on me, please.

1287
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:27,324
What's that supposed to
mean? Take it easy on him?

1288
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,729
- Let's go smoke that joint.
- He's in for a surprise.

1289
01:24:39,509 --> 01:24:43,468
- # Tuesday's gone #

1290
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:47,072
# With the wind #

1291
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:53,915
- # Tuesday's gone with the wind ##
- All right! Good.

1292
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:56,491
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Hey, man, no worries.

1293
01:24:56,593 --> 01:24:58,493
- Take care.
- All right.

1294
01:24:58,595 --> 01:25:00,495
- Pick you up tomorrow, 4:00?
- Okay.

1295
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:02,497
Hey.

1296
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:05,329
Aerosmith. Three weeks.
Front row seats, babe.

1297
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:07,335
All right. I won't forget.

1298
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:12,340
So, uh, who's buying breakfast?

1299
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:14,342
- Not me.
- I will, I guess.

1300
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:16,344
- You coming along?
- Sure.

1301
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:18,346
- Night, John Boy. Ali.
- Good night.

1302
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,850
"Wood-a-been. "
What's going on?

1303
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,852
Pink, my man. What's happenin'?

1304
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:27,286
- Not a lot.
- Cynthia, man?

1305
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,654
- I like her, man. Very nice.
- Yeah?

1306
01:25:29,759 --> 01:25:32,387
- Red's a good color for you.
- My favorite color.

1307
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:35,589
- Have you seen Jodi around?
- Man, she left your ass.

1308
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:39,190
Really? Well, you win
some, you lose some.

1309
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:41,202
What about Peter Frampton?

1310
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:43,204
- I like him.
- Hey!

1311
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:46,366
- Slater, what's happenin', man?
- What's goin' on, man?

1312
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:48,706
- Guys, what's goin' on?
- Nothing!

1313
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:52,076
- Pickford, what do you know?
- What time is it? God.

1314
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:54,081
Let's go smoke a joint, man!

1315
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:58,882
On the 50-fuckin'- yard line, in
honor of your daddy, Coach Conrad.

1316
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:01,616
We're there! Great idea!

1317
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:04,215
- The man with the plan.
- Wanna come with me?

1318
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:06,227
Okay.

1319
01:26:06,329 --> 01:26:08,229
Hey.

1320
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:11,767
Joint subcommittee meeting on
the 50 yard line in 15. You there?

1321
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:13,893
- Okay.
- Don, y'all ride with me, man.

1322
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,903
Let's hit it.

1323
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:18,132
- This is cashed, man.
- It's in there, man.

1324
01:26:18,241 --> 01:26:21,335
You can ride with us, man, but you're
ridin' in the back, 'cause I got shotgun.

1325
01:26:21,444 --> 01:26:23,571
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah. - H-Hey!

1326
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:27,047
Hey, hey, hey! Watch the leather, man!

1327
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:31,118
Oh, fuck it!

1328
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:37,190
- Don't you quit! Do you wanna hit him?
- He was wide open!

1329
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:40,785
- Do you want to hit him?
- Jesus, son! You're wearing Rebel gray!

1330
01:26:40,897 --> 01:26:43,297
- Now, break down! Break down!
- I'm sorry, Coach.

1331
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:45,959
I want you on him like stink
on shit! I say, stink on shit!

1332
01:26:46,069 --> 01:26:49,129
Break down! You don't deserve
to wear that Rebel gray, boy!

1333
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:52,833
You don't deserve to wear it! You
won't hit him? You won't hit him?

1334
01:26:52,942 --> 01:26:55,502
O.T.S.S! Only the strong survive!

1335
01:26:55,612 --> 01:26:57,512
- Only the strong survive!
- Only the strong survive, boy!

1336
01:26:57,614 --> 01:26:59,844
- Only the strong survive!
- That's it!

1337
01:26:59,949 --> 01:27:02,850
Now, where's your pitch man?
Hit your goddamn pitch man!

1338
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:09,182
He fumbles!

1339
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:12,193
Hey, man!

1340
01:27:12,295 --> 01:27:15,196
Hell, my grandmother
can hit harder than that!

1341
01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:17,698
What the fuck, man?

1342
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,701
Course, she's an 8 foot 4,
652-pound, hairy-ass gorilla...

1343
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,896
drives a Mack truck
and runs the 40 in 10.2.

1344
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:27,636
Hell, she's gotten bigger lately,
man. She was only 6'2", 195 in my day.

1345
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,712
Still drives that Mack truck though.

1346
01:27:29,812 --> 01:27:31,837
Hey, Pink, you got my papers, man?

1347
01:27:31,948 --> 01:27:34,314
Uh, yeah, there's some
in my glove compartment.

1348
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:38,080
I got 'em. Hit me on a slant.
Give me the keys to an inside.

1349
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:40,087
Hut. Down!

1350
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:42,953
Marijuana on one!

1351
01:27:43,059 --> 01:27:44,959
Reefer on two!

1352
01:27:45,061 --> 01:27:47,962
Hut! Hut!

1353
01:27:48,064 --> 01:27:50,862
- Wide open!

1354
01:27:50,967 --> 01:27:52,594
I got it! Sweet!

1355
01:27:52,702 --> 01:27:56,069
Oh!

1356
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:58,072
That's pretty good.

1357
01:27:58,174 --> 01:28:00,074
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

1358
01:28:00,176 --> 01:28:03,737
Could be, like, a little ?I don't know.
Maybe perhaps a little more symmetrical.

1359
01:28:03,846 --> 01:28:05,746
- Does that hurt?
- Oww!

1360
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:07,748
- Yes! PI ?It ?
- Sorry. Sorry.

1361
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,750
- It's a bruise.
- Okay.

1362
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:12,252
I don't know. Let me ask
you something, though.

1363
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:14,915
I mean, I got some
pretty good ones in there.

1364
01:28:15,024 --> 01:28:18,050
I mean, it's not like I ?You wouldn't
say I got my ass kicked, right?

1365
01:28:18,161 --> 01:28:20,061
Oh, no. You know ?I don't know.

1366
01:28:20,163 --> 01:28:23,724
After a couple years, people won't
even remember, really, who won or lost.

1367
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,733
Yeah ?No, you're right.

1368
01:28:25,835 --> 01:28:28,736
You read about, like, Jackson
Pollock or Ernest Hemingway?

1369
01:28:28,838 --> 01:28:31,238
You never read about who won or
lost, just, they got into a brawl.

1370
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,240
Right. Exactly.

1371
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:36,243
Well, uh, thanks for the ride
and breakfast and everything.

1372
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:38,245
No problem.

1373
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:42,716
Sure is nice to pile on some pancakes and
syrup after a night of beer drinking, isn't it?

1374
01:28:46,022 --> 01:28:47,649
Um ?

1375
01:28:57,033 --> 01:28:59,331
Good night.

1376
01:29:11,981 --> 01:29:13,949
Good night.

1377
01:29:17,887 --> 01:29:20,583
- Hope you're not grounded or anything.
- Thanks.

1378
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:27,885
"Not to indulge in any alcohol,
drugs, sex after 12:00...

1379
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:29,897
or any other illegal activity?

1380
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:33,230
- Oh, not my shadow.
- Slater, pay me for that.

1381
01:29:33,336 --> 01:29:37,238
- Found that in your glove compartment, man.
- You're the third person who's given me this today.

1382
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,240
God.

1383
01:29:39,342 --> 01:29:41,742
What do you reckon you're gonna do?

1384
01:29:41,844 --> 01:29:45,177
I don't know. I'll probably end up signing
it. I just don't wanna give in so easy.

1385
01:29:45,281 --> 01:29:48,182
Man, it's the same bullshit
they tried to pull in my day.

1386
01:29:48,284 --> 01:29:52,345
If it ain't that piece of paper, it's some
other choice they're gonna try and make for ya.

1387
01:29:52,455 --> 01:29:56,949
You gotta do what Randall
"Pink" Floyd wants to do, man.

1388
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:02,759
And let me tell you this The older you do get, the
more rules they're gonna try to get you to follow.

1389
01:30:02,865 --> 01:30:06,494
You just gotta keep
livin', man. L- I-V-I-N.

1390
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:11,572
Man, if you're gonna
sign that paper, man...

1391
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:15,701
you should throw a little grass right in
the middle, roll it up, sign the joint, man.

1392
01:30:15,812 --> 01:30:20,215
- That's gonna tell 'em something.
- That's what I'll do. Assholes.

1393
01:30:20,316 --> 01:30:24,582
Yeah, they're all assholes. But think about it.
We've had a lot of good times right here, Pink.

1394
01:30:24,687 --> 01:30:27,588
Yeah, I mean, come on,
Pink. I can't believe this.

1395
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:31,091
You act like you're so oppressed.
Man, you guys are kings of the school.

1396
01:30:31,194 --> 01:30:34,220
You get away with whatever you
want. What are you bitching about?

1397
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:38,596
Look, all I'm saying is, if I ever start
referring to these as the best years of my life...

1398
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:41,795
remind me to kill myself.

1399
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:46,068
All I'm saying is, I just
wanna look back and say...

1400
01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:50,612
that I did it the best I could
while I was stuck in this place...

1401
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:54,410
had as much fun as I could when
I was stuck in this place...

1402
01:30:54,517 --> 01:30:57,850
played as hard as I could when
I was stuck in this place...

1403
01:30:57,954 --> 01:31:00,855
dogged as many chicks as I could
when I was stuck in this place.

1404
01:31:03,693 --> 01:31:06,594
Yeah, right, Mr. Premature Ejaculation.

1405
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:11,462
Oh, that's good. That's good.

1406
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:13,467
- That's good, baby.
- You know it's true.

1407
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:16,402
- Is that the cops?
- What the hell?

1408
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,939
- Oh, shit.
- Hey! All of you!

1409
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,941
Get over here!

1410
01:31:21,043 --> 01:31:22,943
- Now!
- Hey, man, ditch that pot.

1411
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,445
Is it illegal to be
on the football field?

1412
01:31:25,548 --> 01:31:28,449
- I got some more in this fuckin' bag.
- Dump it, dump it, dump it.

1413
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:30,451
Come on, Slater.

1414
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:32,453
What'd we do?

1415
01:31:32,555 --> 01:31:34,523
You got any Visine?

1416
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:38,156
Man, I can't believe this.

1417
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:42,755
If it ain't ol'Richard
Wrath. How you doin', Dick?

1418
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:47,962
Well, well, well. Couple
of football players.

1419
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:51,733
Wonder what Coach is
gonna think of all this.

1420
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:54,139
Line up.

1421
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:57,745
- Wooderson.
- Slavey.

1422
01:31:57,847 --> 01:32:01,578
Relivin' old glories
on the football field?

1423
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,584
Get through there!

1424
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:07,281
You shouldn't still be mad 'cause
I got all-district and you didn't.

1425
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:40,345
What?

1426
01:32:40,456 --> 01:32:43,653
Floyd! Dawson! Get your
scrawny butts over here.

1427
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:48,797
Mornin', Coach.

1428
01:32:50,733 --> 01:32:54,965
So what the hell's goin' on? Why am
I gettin' wake-up calls from the cops?

1429
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:57,972
- That was nothin'. They just left just now.
- False alarm, Coach.

1430
01:32:58,074 --> 01:33:00,042
Come here, Randy. Come here.

1431
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:04,575
You been out with
those losers all night?

1432
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,671
Hey, Coach Conrad.

1433
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:09,250
Remember me? Second period gym class?

1434
01:33:10,987 --> 01:33:13,387
That's the kind of people
I was telling you about.

1435
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:17,220
Trouble like this means nothing to that bunch
of clowns. You're the one with something to lose.

1436
01:33:17,326 --> 01:33:20,227
- Coach, you don't even know them.
- Randy?

1437
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:23,264
How can you even pretend
to talk that way? Huh?

1438
01:33:23,366 --> 01:33:27,598
Okay, Randy, I shouldn't do this, but I'm willing
to wipe the slate clean and forget about all this.

1439
01:33:27,703 --> 01:33:32,163
I want you to get your priorities straightened
out, quit hanging out with that bunch of hoodlums...

1440
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:34,708
and sign your commitment to your team.

1441
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:38,041
- Have you done that yet?
- I'm still thinkin' about it.

1442
01:33:38,147 --> 01:33:41,207
No one's paying you to think
about it. Just do it, son!

1443
01:33:42,952 --> 01:33:45,716
You know, Coach...

1444
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:47,721
I gotta get going.

1445
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:51,020
Me and my loser friends, we
gotta go get Aerosmith tickets.

1446
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:53,095
Top priority of the summer.

1447
01:33:57,166 --> 01:34:00,897
Oh, uh, Coach, uh, I forgot.

1448
01:34:03,706 --> 01:34:06,231
I might play ball...

1449
01:34:06,342 --> 01:34:08,310
but I will never sign that.

1450
01:34:18,888 --> 01:34:20,788
Let's rock and roll.

1451
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:24,951
All right, man! Livin'!

1452
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:28,394
Shit, I'm gettin' my third
wind. Let's get on the road.

1453
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:31,398
- Let's go. You gonna come, man?
- Shotgun!

1454
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,400
Talk to you later, then.

1455
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:36,596
- You guys not goin'?
- Can I use your keys?

1456
01:34:36,705 --> 01:34:38,969
- Yeah.
- Time to boogie on outta here.

1457
01:34:39,075 --> 01:34:40,975
- Hey.
- Let's do it.

1458
01:34:41,077 --> 01:34:43,045
So that's that, huh?

1459
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,147
All right.

1460
01:34:47,249 --> 01:34:49,615
Slate. Aah!

1461
01:34:49,718 --> 01:34:51,686
I never get shotgun.

1462
01:35:06,702 --> 01:35:09,034
Uh, hi, Mom.

1463
01:35:09,138 --> 01:35:11,902
Mmm, okay, Mitchell.

1464
01:35:13,109 --> 01:35:16,010
This is your one
get-out-of-jail-free card...

1465
01:35:16,112 --> 01:35:18,012
so I hope you enjoyed it.

1466
01:35:18,114 --> 01:35:20,014
No.

1467
01:35:20,116 --> 01:35:23,643
Your sister told me everything, so
I've decided to make this deal with you.

1468
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:27,552
I'm ?I'm gonna be
open-minded about it this time.

1469
01:35:27,656 --> 01:35:31,717
But... next time you
come in at sunrise...

1470
01:35:31,827 --> 01:35:33,795
we've got problems.

I've got your final tests here.

Everybody did pretty well.
Uh, I'm gonna call your?

3
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,129
I'm headed this way.
我走这边

00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,060
- Later.
- 再见
- So, what did we decide?
- 我们有什么决定？

5
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,693
- About what?
- 决定什么？
- About tonight.
- 今晚的事
6
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:54,764
Oh, uh, look, I'll probably get, you know,
hung up with the guys maybe, you know, later.

7
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,844
- Why don't we just meet at the party?
- All right.

8
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:00,472
- Wouldn't want you waitin' around for me all night anyway.
- All right. Whatever.

- Cool. I'll see ya later?

9:30. Hmm.

know what I'm talkin' about, so ?

Guess that makes you Deep Throat.

00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,212
- So, is this a smoked or a liquid lunch?
- Hey.

26
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,215
Smoked, right?

27
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:12,252
- So, guys, are we gonna play poker tonight?
- Count me out.

28
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,789
- Sure.
- Uh, I'll probably be going to Pickford's party later, okay? So ?

29
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,858
- No. We should do somethin' like that.
- Yeah.

30
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,621
- Goodwin's on his senior trip. We can play poker anytime.
- Go to a party?

- Come on.

32

- Mike. Cynthia.
- It's under control.

33
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,830
- I don't feel comfortable at those kinds of things.
- Pick us up at 8:00.

34
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,834
- Okay. All right.
- It's gonna be all right.

- Guess we're going to the party. Okay.
- All right.

Oh, Mike. I gotta tell you about
this dream I had last night.

37
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,678
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- But, um...

38
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,805
- you gotta promise not to tell anyone.
- Yeah, sure.

39
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:42,906
- No. Say, "I promise. "
- Jesus.

40
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,451
- I promise not to tell anyone.
- Okay, thank you.

41
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,453
Um, well ?

42
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,718
Okay, there I am, and
I'm gettin' it on ?

43
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:53,157
You know, with what had
this perfect female body.

44
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,161
Uh-huh.

45
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,356
But ?

46
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,729
- What? What? What?
- Um, I can't say.

47
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,826
Come on, man. You can't give a
buildup like that and not deliver.

48
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,770
I mean, come on. A perfect
female body. It's not a bad start.

49
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,232
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.

50
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,506
- Ah.
- I mean, the hat and the beard.

51
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,411
Oh, well. Best not think too
deeply on this one, right?

52
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,645
- Best not.
- Um, I gotta get some stuff from Mr. Birchfield.

53
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:23,884
- Uh, see you in a few minutes.

guy catches that huge wave and lands on the island?

- Oh, yeah! - Do you remember
that? - "Sexy surfer guy. "

57
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,431
- The Mosquitoes. Do you remember that?
- Pink, let's go.

58
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,304
- Come on.
- They were a rock group. Ginger and Mary Ann formed their own group?

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,503
Look, man. I can't go yet
until Miss Wilk gets here.

60
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,343
- So why don't you go get Benny and check me out on the way back, okay?
- All right.

61
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:52,078
- What?
- Coach gave me something to give to you.

62
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,957
- They're really doing this.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:01,119
He wants them all back by the end of
the day too. Can you believe that one?

64
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,595
- And everybody's signing it?
- Just to get him off our back.

65
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,394
The coaches are just being fucking
assholes. Know what I'm saying?

66
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,198
I mean, you sign it, you never
think about it again. Just let it go.

67
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,104
- You're gonna make a big
deal out of this, aren't you?

68
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:19,604
You You're gettin' air from there,
man. It's no good. You see this?

69
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,614
It's gotta be tight.

70
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:25,709
- You're gonna have to put some gum
around the base of that to get a good hit.

- Man, I ain't believin'that shit?
- Two minutes.

74
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,159
About Bonham's one-hour drum solo.

75
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,136
One hour of drums? You couldn't
handle that shit on strong acid, man.

76
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,143
Okay.

77
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,105
Okay. We're gonna go to the bathroom.

78
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,182
Could you guys let Miss Wilks know?

79
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,383
All right. This is totally amazing.

80
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:03,048
"I voluntarily agree to not
indulge in any alcohol, drugs...

"or engage in any other

00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,799
- What bullshit.
- The guys are actually signing this crap?

85
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,804
- Apparently.
- God, what are they gonna do next?

86
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,205
- Like, give you guys urine tests or something?
- I didn't know that drugs and alcohol...

87
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,972
were such a big problem that they
had to resort to neo-McCarthyism.

88
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,139
I think they're just afraid some of
us might be having too good a time.

89
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,308
It's the old age suppressing
youth thing, you know.

90
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:33,581
- "Neo-McCarthyism. " I like
that. - Oh, that's good, Tony.

you talking about, girl?

94

- You weren't thinking about it, were you?
- Gilligan's Island?

95
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,968
It's what's called a
male pornographic fantasy.

96

- Oh, my?
- Think about it.

00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,197
You're basically alone on a deserted
island with two readily available women.

98
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,039
One, a seductive sex goddess type.

99
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,911
The other, a healthy girl-next-door
type with a nice butt.

100
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:04,746
So guys have it all. The
Madonna and the whore.

101
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,945
Women get nothing.

102
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,421
We get a geek, an
overweight middle-age guy...

103
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,458
some nerdy scientific type.

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,552
- I mean?
- The professor is sexy.

105
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,063
Pink, come on, man.

106
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,759
We're off to raise some hell.
Look at that. Look at that!

107
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,927
- Guys.
- Look at?

108
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,733
- All right. Let's go kick some ass.
- Hey, you guys.

109
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,740
- You guys, wait up.
- What?

110
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,469
- Benny.
- What?

111
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,636
- I have a favor to ask ya.
- What do you need?

112
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,680
Take it easy on my
brother this summer, okay?

113
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,681
- All of you.
- Mitch Kramer?

114
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,273
- Yeah. Mitch Kramer.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,582
- I'm gonna give him a beating he'll never forget.
- Ow!

116
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,521
Well, just don't get him more
than the other guys. Any of you.

117
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,990
- Kind of little. All right?
- Got our word, sis.

118
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,789
- Little brother'll be okay.
- Thanks. See you guys.

119
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,796
Ow!

120
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,923
Benny!

121
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:55,662
- These guys. I don't know.
- Oh, you love it.

122
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,671
Oh, there's just a little bit
of bullshit in all that, right?

123
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,934
Major bullshit. He's a
dead man. He's fuckin' dead.

124
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,509
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!

125
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,380
Check it out, boys, huh? I've been
waitin'three long years for this one.

126
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:13,544
- Oh, yeah.
- Thosejunior high kids are dead meat. I promise you.

00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,748
- Beat 'em!
- Oh, man. Oh, yeah.

128
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,733
Okay, all you freshman fucks. Listen up.

129
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:33,637
It's your lucky day. Usually you'd be spending
your freshman summer getting your asses busted...

130
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,971
and running for your
worthless little lives...

131
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,409
but this year, because we
feel so sorry for you...

132
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,003
we're gonna take it easy on you...

133
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,174
and save us all a lot of time.

134
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:46,310
So, if you meet here ?right here ?

135
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,320
after school today...

136
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,788
you only get one lick from each of us.

137
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,825
But you run like cowards ?

138
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:57,523
well, it's open season
all summer long, boys.

139
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,191
Oh, yeah. Mitch Kramer?

140
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,031
Mitchy. Mitchy, Mitchy, Mitchy.

141
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,273
We're looking for you, pal.

142
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:08,899
Your ass will be purple
before the day is over.

143
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,011
Have a nice afternoon.

144
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,448
You better get out of town.

145
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,075
Go spend the summer with your
grandparents or somethin'.

146
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,218
Hey, man. You are gonna show up
to our game tonight, aren't you?

147
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:26,919
Yeah. I'm pitching. I kind of have to.

148
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,496
How should we inscribe your tombstone?

149
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,164
How about "Ben Over"?

150
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:36,828
Yeah, right, pissant. Why
aren't they after anybody else?

151
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,905
They are, man. Believe me.

152
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,906
I know, man.

153
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,442
- Come on, Mel. Hop on.
- Let's go, boy.

154
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,555
Oh, shit.

155
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,659
Hey, Coach.

156
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,886
So, tell me.

157
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,864
Any of you girls gonna be ready
to play some football this fall?

158
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,866
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know, Coach.

159
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,732
You know, uh, I been doing so good
in English classes, you know...

160
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,965
I figured I'd take next
fall off and become a writer.

161
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:15,042
What do you think about that, huh?

162
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,203
Boy, you wouldn't know how to write your
name if it wasn't stenciled on your locker.

163
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,771
No, seriously. Everybody. Now, don't
go getting soft on me this summer.

164
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:27,445
You know, you're sitting around the
pool all day, chasing the muff around.

165
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,682
Break down!

166
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,248
Hell, man. My grandmother's quicker
and tougher than you pansies.

167
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,260
Of course, she's 6'3", 250.

168
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,557
Runs a 4.540.

169
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,792
What's the matter with you, Floyd?

170
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,267
What, quarterbacks don't have to do
what their coaches say? Is that it?

171
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,634
Dawson, did you give
him that pledge sheet?

172
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,708
- The pledge sheet. You give it to him?
- Yeah, Coach. It's right here.

173
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,041
Randy, if you could get that back to us by the
end of the day, we'd feel a lot better about it.

174
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,479
- You guys see that he does this, okay?
- All right, Coach.

175
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,483
See ya, Coach.

176
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,019
- Randy Floyd.
- Aw, shit.

177
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:04,080
Before next fall, you're in need of a
serious attitude adjustment, young man.

178
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,091
You better get your priorities straight.

179
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:10,152
And watch out with that other crowd you're
runnin' with. Don't think I haven't noticed.

180
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,664
- Hey! -
Uh-oh, Pink.

181
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:17,328
I want that piece of paper on my desk
before you leave here today. Do you hear me?

182
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,974
Get an attitude adjustment.
You know what I mean?

183
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,777
- Priorities straight, buddy.
- Runs with a bad crowd.

184
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,784
- Bad people.
- Watch yourself.

185
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:37,791
Yeah, well, I've got Coach's and everybody
else's attitude-adjusted priorities...

186
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,292
right here.

187
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,362
- Yeah, that's good, Pink.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,129
Oh! Did you know O'Bannion flunked?

189
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,202
Yeah. What a dumb-shit.

190
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:56,206
Whoo! Y'all ready to bust some ass?

191
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,369
- What's up, Don? Benny. Melvin.
- Hey.

192
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,379
- See ya later.
- Good to see ya.

193
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,972
Yeah.

194
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,018
Hey. We gotta take your truck.
I'm low on gas. All right?

195
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,680
- We need to take my truck?
- Yeah. Okay?

196
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,689
- Yeah.
- Good.

197
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,123
- What are you doing? Picking up trash?
- What? What?

198
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:16,822
Man, I was just waiting for one of
them idiot coaches to piss me off again.

199
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,195
I think you take the whole
thing a little too personal.

200
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,030
I think you just gotta
?You gotta shake it off.

201
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:25,196
Don, have you ever thought
about why we play football?

202
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:29,265
I mean, how many times have you gotten laid
strictly because you're a football player, huh?

203
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,178
I don't know. A few probably.

204
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,182
A few? Don, all I'm saying is that...

205
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:41,243
I bet we could do just as well
if we were in a band or somethin'.

206
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,755
Well, I gotta put in a
final appearance. So ?

207
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,382
Wait a minute. Who you
got goin' in there? Shh.

208
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,062
Vicky. Vicky!

209
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,894
Come on. Let's skip out. Let's
go get naked right now. Let's go.

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,558
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

211
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,499
- Mr. Dawson.
- Yeah.

212
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:58,504
Why don't you take it somewhere else?

213
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:01,268
Oh, Mr. Floyd. Are you gracing
us with your presence today?

214
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,639
Uh, might as well.

215
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,942
You know, Ginny, I was thinking maybe you
and I can get together over the summer.

216
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,347
It'll be legal. We could make things
happen. I'll keep it mum's the word.

217
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,420
I promise. I swear to you.

218
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,324
At the party tonight, I heard there's
gonna be a girl with knockers this big.

219
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,362
- Bullshit. - Promise. Two
handfuls. - Shut up, Carl.

220
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,364
- No way.
- Yes.

221
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,663
- Uh-uh. -
Hey. Psst. Hey.

222
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,169
Pentico got his brother's car. Let's go.

223
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,172
- Cool, man.
- Cool.

224
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:36,038
- Go talk to him.
- I'm not going alone.

225
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,668
Come on. Come on. Ask him.

226
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,714
Uh, Mr. Payne, sir...

227
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,216
you know, every second that
you could let us out early...

228
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,015
would really increase
our chances of survival.

229
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,892
It's like our sergeant told us
before one trip into the jungle.

230
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,028
"Men!

231
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,226
Fifty of you are leaving on a mission.
Twenty-five of ya ain't comin' back. "

232
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,938
Okay.

233
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,968
You know, the '68
Democratic Convention...

234
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,567
was probably the most
bitchin'time I ever had in my life.

235
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,910
Hey, guys. One more
thing. Hey. This summer...

236
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:19,042
when you're being inundated with all this
American bicentennial Fourth ofJuly brouhaha...

237
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,451
don't forget what you're
celebrating, and that's the fact...

238
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:24,183
that a bunch of slave-owning
aristocratic white males...

239
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,225
didn't want to pay their taxes.

240
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,352
- Yeah!
- Have a good summer.

241
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,255
Hey. Over there. Let's get 'em.

242
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,564
Hey! No cutting.

243
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,878
Hey. Hey, hey.

244
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:59,441
Hey!

245
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,453
- Run, man!

246
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,549
Jump in. Come on. We gotta go.

247
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

248
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,222
- Whoo!
- Hurry up, Hirshfelder. We're gonna leave your ass.

249
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,231
- Sorry, man.
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.

250
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,325
- Whoa. Back it up. Back it up.
- Oh, shit!

251
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:19,429
- Whoo-ee! Ducks on the
pond. - How you doin', boys?

252
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,701
Whoo!

253
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,709
Wake up, bitch. Wake up.

254
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:33,082
Open. Open. Hey, hey. Open.

255
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,458
Okay. Open wide.

256
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,529
Open wide.

257
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,590
- Open. Yeah.
- What do you think?

258
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,100
All right. We got 'em.

259
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,364
Hey, you. Come here.

260
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,642
You.

261
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,870
- Who are you?
- Uh, nobody.

262
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,539
I mean, I wasn't in the truck.

263
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,116
- Are you a freshman?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,686
Well, are you in, or are you out?

265
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,982
- In.
- Let's go.

266
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,726
Come on! Let's go!

267
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,853
Go! Come on! Hurry up!

268
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,761
Oh, man. We're screwed!

269
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,391
- Pentico, lose them.
- I'm tryin', man!

270
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,993
Whoo!

271
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,369
- Let's go! Come on!
- Who you fuckin' with?

272
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,671
- Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!
- Drive! Drive this piece of shit!

273
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,836
Shut up, man. Here they come.

274
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,749
Fucking turn!

275
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,252
Oh, shit!

276
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,861
- Come on! Let's go! Whoo!

277
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,432
Oh, shit! Here they come!

278
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,799
I think we really pissed them off,
man. Just drop me off at my house.

279
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:59,236
- Are you still with me?
- Yeah. I guess.

280
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,603
- This is my house.
- They're slowing down.

281
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,700
You get out and get 'em. You get out.

282
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,109
- Good luck, man. Be there tonight.
- All right.

283
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,447
All right. I'll catch up with
you guys later. Go, go, go.

284
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,786
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, nice try, freshmen.

285
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,452
Tell you what. Just for being
such brave little kids...

286
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,928
I'm only gonna give each
of ya five licks, okay?

287
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,489
All right. Grab a pole
then, kids. Let's get goin'.

288
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,126
I don't think so, creep.

289
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:32,228
Mom!

290
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,467
Carl, get in the
house. Get in the house!

291
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:40,335
And you ?Get the hell off my property.

292
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:45,009
Oh. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. I was just
escorting your fine young son home from school.

293
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:48,019
There's?There were some
ruffians about, and I?

294
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,988
Oh, and, uh, Mitch, Carl.

295
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,992
We'll be seeing each other again.

296
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:02,368
Oh, that's it. I fuckin'saw that, you
little sack of shit. You two are fuckin'dead!

297
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,495
You hear me? You're fuckin' dead!

298
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,197
Excuse me. Thank you.

299
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,272
All right, you little freshman bitches.

300
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:18,180
Air raid!

301
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,116
That was pathetic!

302
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,120
You guys are crumbs!

303
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,124
Let's try it again! That means get
up, you lazy little bitches. Get up!

304
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,126
You heard her!

305
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,322
Air raid!

306
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:35,527
That was horrible, you little slut
girls. You little freshman sluts. Get up!

307
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:39,367
Get up! Up! Up! Up!

308
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,237
Air raid!

309
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,310
What's fascinating is the
way not only the school...

310
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,471
but the entire community seems to be
supporting this ?or at least turn their heads.

311
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,879
- They apparently have permission to use the parking lot.
- Right.

312
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,451
No parents seem to mind. You
know. They're selling concessions.

313
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,019
- I mean ?
- I know.

314
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:57,522
The seniors, we tried. We
We gave you all a chance.

315
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:02,652
But since you little prick-teases
can't follow instructions...

316
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,732
we're just gonna have to
try something else, won't we?

317
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,993
Seniors ?

318
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,831
You love us. Smile. You love us.

319
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,570
Turn over.

320
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,550
Suffer, sisters!

321
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,744
Suffer!

322
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,753
Whoo!

323
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:37,122
Eat it! Open wide!

324
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,098
- Open wide! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
- # Why can't we be friends #

325
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,431
Yes! Whoo!

326
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,869
Love it, girls. Love it!

327
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,532
Gorgeous babies.

328
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,137
Welcome to high school, honey.

329
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,737
- You love it, honey.
- You little bitch!

330
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:00,252
#I remember you when you drank my wine #

331
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,719
- # Why can't we be friends #
- Go!

332
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,848
Propose to Mr. Dawson.

333
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,893
You idiot.

334
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,489
- Will you marry me?
- Don't know. What's in it for me?

335
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,089
- Suck on it harder.
- Anything you want.

336
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,101
- Anything?
- Anything.

337
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,228
Go like this.

338
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,399
- Do you spit or swallow?
- Oh ?

339
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,171
Whatever you I-like.

340
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:27,576
Whatever I like? I would
definitely marry you.

341
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,581
- That is so degrading.
- Let's go.

342
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,676
- You're an asshole.
- Yes, I am.

343
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:36,756
That's terrible, man. It's horrible.

344
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,451
Aha!

345
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,027
I just want you guys to
know I feel for you, man.

346
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:45,326
I did it when I was a freshman, and
you'll do it when you're a senior.

347
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:49,129
But you're doing great. Now fry like
bacon, you little freshman piggies!

348
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:51,466
Fry! Fry!

349
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,562
- Hi.
- Hi.

350
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:57,507
- Hello there.
- I would like for you to propose to Tony.

351
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,442
Oh, God.

352
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,514
On your knees.

353
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,184
Will you marry me?

354
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,553
- What am I supposed to say here?
- I ?I don't know.

355
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,058
Um, what'll you do for me, huh?

356
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,288
Um, anything you want.

357
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,365
- Imagine the possibilities.
- Oh, Jesus.

358
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,366
No, seriously, you can stand up.

359
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,527
- Um, what's your name?
- Sabrina.

360
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:25,036
- I'm Tony.
- Hi.

361
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,800
- Anthony actually.
- Sorry.

362
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,808
- This is Mike.
- Hey.

363
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,004
We were just discussing the utter
stupidity of these initiation rituals...

364
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,809
and we were we're kind of
wondering why someone like you...

365
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,248
would subject yourself to
the losing end of it all.

366
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,319
What are we having?
Social hour over here?

367
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,184
I'm supposed to be being
a bitch. Back to the pit.

368
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,053
All right, kiddo.

369
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,991
- It's almost over. Don't worry about it.
- So, uh, am I mistaken...

370
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,892
or was there a little unspoken
thing going on with that young vixen?

371
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,897
- You stud.
- You know how it is.

372
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,196
- I bet she's pretty cute once you clean all the shit off her.
- I bet she is.

373
00:23:56,303 --> 00:24:00,933
Okay, girlies! It's hot out here, and
I'm really sick of looking at all of you.

374
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,407
So let's just ?Let's get out of here.

375
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,469
What are you looking at? Wipe
that face off your head, bitch.

376
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,947
Let's go! Get in the truck!

377
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,018
Get in the truck! Come on!

378
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,382
You know, maybe if you
ever left the poker table ?

379
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,682
Maybe if I ever left the
poker table? What about you?

380
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,953
Whatever. I mean, the point is, that's
why we're going out tonight. You know?

381
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,121
Who knows? You might experience something a
little more tangible than an Abraham Lincoln dream.

382
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:27,190
- That's, like, a hairline fracture right there.
- Shit.

383
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,564
- What's that about? What'd you do?
- I wouldn't doubt it.

384
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,830
My boy Benny was wearing
their asses out, boy!

385
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:36,068
- Shit.
- I just gave him a little beating he'll never forget.

386
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,144
Here's to ya, Ma.

387
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,374
That's your fucking mother.

388
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,780
Say, man. Fuck the coaches,
man. Just do it for us, man.

389
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,853
- You picked this thing up?
- Yeah. You know.

390
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,012
Hey. What are you doin'?

391
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:51,022
- He ain't doin' shit now.
- What?

392
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:54,719
Got any more details of my life you got
figured out you can let me in on, Ben?

393
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,296
Lots of details.

394
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:00,298
- Hey, O'Bannion, what are you doing?
- What's happening?

395
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,368
Oh, you didn't hear, did you?

396
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,733
- What?
- Didn't hear I got a shotgun pulled on my ass?

397
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,738
- No way!
- Swear to God.

398
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,740
# Seniors are the best #

399
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,776
# Seniors, seniors #

400
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,777
S- E- N-I-O-R-S ##

401
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,909
Oh, my God!

402
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,244
# Seniors, seniors #

403
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,514
#They are the best #

404
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,002
Ow. Freezing!

405
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,369
Hey, Mrs. Pickford.

406
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,667
Hi, guys. You here to see Kevin?

407
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:44,005
- No. Actually, we came here to see you.
- Oh.

408
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,511
- Bet you're glad school's out, aren't you?
- Yeah. We got our report cards today.

409
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:49,946
- How did you do?
- Straight A's.

410
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,143
- Both of you?
- Yeah.

411
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:54,516
- Big trip, huh?
- We're going away for the weekend.

412
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,351
- Oh, you're taking Kev with ya, huh?
- No. He's staying here.

413
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,357
Oh. Oh, he is. Oh.

414
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:02,053
- Thanks.
- Go on in. He's up there somewhere.

415
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:12,004
- Let's get together sometime. All right?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

416
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,005
- All right.
- Be lots of fun.

417
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,098
- Yeah.
- What do you do? I mean, for fun.

418
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:19,804
Usually just hang out with the girls. You
know, drive around. That kind of stuff.

419
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,313
There's a big party tonight.
It should be really great.

420
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,383
- Oh.
- So ?

421
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,318
- Do you want to come?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

423
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,322
- Cool. Think it'll be all right?
- It'll be fine.

424
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,619
- Great. We'll pick you up at about 8:30.
- Okay. Cool.

425
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,627
- See you then.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

426
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,754
Bye.

427
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,458
All right. Let's go. We gotta get ready.

428
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,911
Sample of the goods.

429
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,948
Fifteen bucks.

430
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,519
Can you spot me 10?

431
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,215
I'll pay you, like, Tuesday and shit.

432
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,695
Thank you.

433
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,924
"Shebanga. " Who is it?

434
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:16,594
- Kevin, I think you need to come out here a minute.
- Hide the shit.

435
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,467
- Oh, man. It reeks in here.
- Shit.

436
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,767
Slater, get up.

437
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:25,402
Kevin, there's someone out here
who says he needs to talk to you.

438
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:27,412
Here. What about?

439
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:30,039
Go get the door man. Here.

440
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,311
- Slater, lose it.
- Kevin, open the door.

441
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,785
- Quick!
- Lose it, man. Damn.

442
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,388
Hey, Dad, Ma. What's up?

443
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,256
- Did you order some kegs of beer?
- No.

444
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,627
Well, there's a fella in a beer truck
out on the street that says you did.

445
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,461
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

446
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,967
Just a sec.

447
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,974
Shit.

448
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,168
- That guy said I ordered a keg of beer?
- Yeah.

449
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,044
He said it was to be delivered
to the Pickford residence.

450
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,208
- This address?
- This address.

451
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:09,118
That's kind of funny. Why don't I
go out there and see what's goin' on?

452
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:11,190
Yeah. I think you better.

453
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,759
I'll be right back.

454
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,953
You guys know anything
about a party here tonight?

455
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,528
- No, sir.
- No.

456
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,665
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

457
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,867
Hey, man.

458
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,035
- Aren't you a little bit early?
- Uh ?

459
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,979
Yeah. About an hour and a half.

460
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,549
But, see, I wanted to get here
early, see if anyone's here.

461
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:43,020
- I got this little action happening tonight, man, if you know what I mean.
- So I guess you got the wrong house.

462
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,624
Oh.

463
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:51,186
Yeah. Inconvenience for you. I'm sorry.
Uh, wrong Mr. Pickford all together.

464
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,891
Hey. These things happen.
Don't worry about it, Ben.

465
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,968
Yeah.

466
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,137
Were you going to have a
party here tonight, Son?

467
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,573
I don't know what that was all about.

468
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,839
Start unpacking. We're
not goin' anywhere.

469
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,039
Frank?

470
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,117
- Fucker!
- Frank?

471
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,329
Oh, look out! Look out! Look out! Aaah!

472
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,961
Hey, batter, batter, batter, swing!

473
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,169
Strike two!

474
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,180
Time.

475
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:27,209
Kramer, one more pitch. You better get this
kid out or we're really gonna beat your ass.

476
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,689
We're gonna beat you
like a running mule.

477
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:36,160
Hey, man. Forget about those guys.
Let's just get this last guy out, okay?

478
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,162
Easy for your ass to say.

479
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,324
- Hey, man. There's nothing you can do about it.
- I'll beat you too.

480
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:43,766
- How'd they all know I was gonna be here?
- Hey, Kramer!

481
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,929
Quit stallin'! Let's go,
baby! We're waiting for you!

482
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,701
I hope you got more than a jockstrap
under there, you little rat!

483
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:53,006
Just because you're not gonna be able to sit down for the
rest of the summer, don't let it affect your concentration.

484
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,012
- Up yours.
- Hey, Mitch.

485
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,572
Could you do the rest of us a favor and
leave through the gate in right field?

486
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,585
That'll draw them all out of here.

487
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,746
I mean, they're gonna get you anyway.

488
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,358
Yeah. Get out of here.

489
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:10,395
- Who are you, buddy?
- What are you looking at? Keep your head in the game. Concentrate!

490
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:31,174
Strike three! Ball game!

491
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:51,398
Good game. Good game. Good
game. Good game. Good game.

492
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:55,565
- Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. Right.
- Good game. Good game.

493
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,100
Yeah, right. Good game.
Good game, man. Good game.

494
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,738
Oh, yeah. Good game. Good game.

495
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:06,341
Way to go, buddy. Way to go.

496
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,420
Way to go.

497
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,546
Come here, man!

498
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,556
Mitchy.

499
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:16,958
- Oh, what happened to your buds?
- Aw, you're all alone.

500
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:19,327
- Hey, Mi ?Oh.
- Oh.

501
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:22,924
- Hey, Mitch. Mitch! Hey!
- Kramer.

502
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:27,638
- How's your dad doing?
- Uh, he's doing great.

503
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,774
This arm ready to throw
about 2,000 yards next fall?

504
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:35,109
Oh. I don't know. We'll see.

505
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,774
We're depending on you boys.

506
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:41,012
And let me tell you
what. You're looking good.

507
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,180
Thirteen starters coming
back. Twenty-two lettermen.

508
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,851
- Lookin' tough.
- Yeah.

509
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,260
- Well, uh, you folks take care.
- Okay. Good to see you, Randy.

510
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,339
Whoa!

511
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,467
Oh, God! You know that hurt!
You know that hurt him, man.

512
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:14,307
- What's goin' on here?
- Oh, Pink, man. You missed it. Whoo!

513
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,677
- What's up, buddy?
- Where you guys headed off to now?

514
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,081
- We're going up to the Emporium. Gonna join us?
- Yeah. See you up there.

515
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,688
You should sign my paddle later.

516
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,882
- I gotta get seconds with him.
- Wait, wait, wait.

517
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:28,085
- This is just too slick.
- You next, Pink?

518
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:31,493
- Sure.
- All right. Say, you already got the kid.

519
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:35,431
All right. Fuck it. You know what? I'm gonna
go find your little skinny partner Carl...

520
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:38,595
and his mom, and let me tell you
something, I took it easy on you.

521
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:42,265
All right? Yeah. You're not smiling
now, are you? You little sack of shit.

522
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,309
Huh? Huh?

523
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,471
- Benny, Don.
- Say, man.

524
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,174
- Bummer about Pickford's party, huh?
- Yeah.

525
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:55,050
Yeah. His old man found
out. Total rip-off, man.

526
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,125
Hey, man. You know, us ?We
got a few sixers. You with us?

527
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,256
Uh, yeah. I gotta go home and
change. I'll catch up with you, okay?

528
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,233
All right. See you later. Hey,
kid. Take care of that butt.

529
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,463
- Say, guys. Hold up.

530
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,337
You need a ride?

531
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:22,573
Yeah. Uh...

532
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,980
I think they left me.

533
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:29,421
Here you go, man.

534
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:48,402
Yeah, there's always one
senior who has to be the badass.

535
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:54,942
I think O'Bannion's gonna be the first senior
in history to take that honor two years in a row.

536
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,811
Guy's a dick. Right?

537
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:02,485
Yeah. He's, uh, kind of a joke.

538
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,853
He's not a bad guy to have on
your side, though, blocking for ya.

539
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,620
Yeah.

540
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,390
Did you get it bad when
you were a freshman?

541
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:14,091
Shit, man. Aw.

542
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,601
They waited for my ass after
baseball practice and got me.

543
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:20,536
God, it was vicious.

544
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,438
I mean, actually, it is best to
get a lot at once, you know...

545
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:27,740
'cause after about 10 licks, your ass gets
so numb, you might as well get it over with.

546
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:32,077
I had some pretty cool
seniors though, you know.

547
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:35,153
They'd take you out and bust
the hell out of you and then...

548
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,154
go get you drunk.

549
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,157
- You know, stuff like that.
- Cool.

550
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:48,296
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Take care, man.

551
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:55,098
Uh, hey, man. Uh, look. Since
the party's not goin' on...

552
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:59,541
me and some of the other guys will
probably end upjust riding around.

553
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:02,170
You want us to stop by and pick you up?

554
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,717
- Well, do you think that's a good idea?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, man. No problem.

555
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:10,221
Even after you've gotten it bad, the guys who
haven't got you yet will give you a few days to rest.

556
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:14,782
It, uh ?It'd be a pretty cool move to show up
and let 'em know it doesn't bother you that much.

557
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:17,260
Yeah, okay. Cool.

558
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,854
- See you later?
- Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the ride, man.

559
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,698
Hey, man. Uh, put some
ice on it for a while.

560
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,533
After that it won't be anything
a few beers can't take care of.

561
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,152
Like, what did she say?
I'm just interested.

562
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:16,346
I think it's funny.
What did she call me?

563
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:20,118
You hang out with her. You know it. We
know they talk about us. Just tell us.

564
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,126
- Nothing.
- We don't care.

565
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:26,289
Oh, come on. Nothing. That's a lie when
you do that. I know you're lying, you bitch.

566
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,389
- I know you're lying.
- You're not gonna get mad?

567
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:31,595
I'm not gonna get mad. I think it's
a riot. I don't care what she thinks.

568
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,571
All right. She called you
a bitch and you a slut.

569
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,870
A slut? She called me a
slut? That bitch. I can't ?

570
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:40,104
- Everybody calls you a slut.
- Shavonne!

571
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,908
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, that bitch. I'm gonna kick her ass.

572
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,006
I can't believe that. What a bitch.

573
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,950
- I thought you said you weren't gonna get mad.
- I'm not mad.

574
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,594
- Look. I got a confession to make.
- What do you mean a confession?

575
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,757
For the, like, last year or so I've
been talking about going to law school...

576
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:05,735
so I can be an A.C.L.U. Lawyer and be in a
position to help people who are getting fucked over.

577
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,035
- Uh-huh. - Well, I was standing in line
at the post office yesterday, you know.

578
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,735
And I'm looking around. And
everybody's looking really pathetic.

579
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,280
You know what I mean? I mean, like,
people had ?like, got drool just sort of?

580
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,975
Then this guy's bending over.
You could see the crack of his ?

581
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,711
It was, like, wife beaters.
It was Anyway, it was ?

582
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,948
And I realized I just don't want
to do it. You know what I mean?

583
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:28,550
It sounds good, but I have to confront the fact that I
don't like the people I've been talking about helping out.

584
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,789
You know what I'm ?I don't think I
like people, period. You guys are okay.

585
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,990
I'm just trying to be honest
about being a misanthrope.

586
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,067
So you're not gonna go to law school?

587
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:38,898
What do you want to do then?

588
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,904
I want to dance.

589
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,445
All right. Let's rock and roll.

590
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,317
Hey. Hop in, man.

591
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,547
Hey, man. Whose car?

592
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,850
- You know Wooderson?
- How's it goin', man?

593
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,086
Hey. Pretty good.
How's it goin' with you?

594
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:07,459
Say, man. You got a joint?

595
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,625
Uh, no. Not on me, man.

596
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,265
It'd be a lot cooler if you did.

597
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:25,243
All right, all right, all right.

598
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:29,253
Hey, man. You still driving in to Houston in
the morning to get those Aerosmith tickets?

599
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:31,255
Ooh, you're damn right.

600
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:33,848
- Evenin', ladies. Ow!
- Nice.

601
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,723
- Need me to pick you up a couple?
- Yeah. Two.

602
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,729
Cool.

603
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,360
- Hey, man. You sure I'm okay in here?
- Yeah, man. You'll be okay.

604
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,199
Look. If anyone starts messing
with you, just play it cool.

605
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,163
- One to go.

606
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:23,173
"Prickford. "

607
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:24,708
"Wood-a-been.
"Happening?

608
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,869
It's a bummer about your party, man.

609
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:30,346
What can I say? It's beyond
me. The delivery guy bricked.

610
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:32,713
And it's a ?Keep your eye on the ball ?

611
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:34,115
dead issue!

612
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,153
- Hey, man. How's it going?
- Good. What's goin' on?

613
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,347
- Nothin'.
- Not much?

614
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,855
- Nothing at all.
- Hey.

615
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,188
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, you know Mitch?

616
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,319
- Oh, yeah. I think I just heard about you.
- Really? What'd you hear?

617
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,866
- I don't know, man. Are you okay?
- Oh. Yeah.

618
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:52,136
Oh. I guess I'll see
you guys a little later.

619
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,865
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Okay. See you.

620
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:06,913
Hey, man. What grade's she in?

621
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,044
Sophomore.

622
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,054
- Come on. Come on.
- All right.

623
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,784
Hurry up. Go. We gotta hurry though.

624
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:17,020
- Check this out. Double-barreled
purple coming in on Sunday. - Donny.

625
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:20,098
- I got a big surprise for you.
- After I make this shot.

626
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:23,691
Oh, God. Hold onto this.
Tight. Lookin' good.

627
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:28,038
Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,938
Whoa! Gene!

629
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:32,943
Nice tongue!

630
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,036
- Who painted 'em?
- Mostly Michelle.

631
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:37,672
Ah!

632
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,842
- Hey. I got an idea.
- What?

633
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:42,420
- A beer bust later on.
- Hey, man.

634
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:45,354
Pickford's got a doob we're
about to burn. Are you with us?

635
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,925
Think about it. Yeah.

636
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:49,961
Are you cool, man?

637
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,530
Like how?

638
00:43:56,435 --> 00:43:58,596
Okay.

639
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:01,366
Hey, man. Wait up.

640
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,668
He was just asking if you get high.

641
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:06,142
- Yeah. Like, smoke pot?
- Yeah.

642
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:08,941
Oh. I never have before, but, you know.

643
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:20,248
- Where you goin'? Mike. Mike.

644
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:22,259

645
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:24,329
Just ?

646
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,064
I ?No.

647
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:33,297
Crank it up!

648
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,910
Look out!

649
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,913
Later.

650
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:46,542
- Hi there.

651
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:48,882
- Great.

652
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:54,482
- Here you go.

653
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,962
Hey. It's the chicks. Shavonne
still thinks she's mad at me.

654
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:04,297
Watch me get a little something going
right here. Hey. What's going on?

655
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:07,133
- What are you guys up to?
- Oh, a little weed. You know.

656
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:10,003
- There may be a beer bust later on.
- Oh, really?

657
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:12,009
- Yeah.
- Cool.

658
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:14,807
- Guess we'll see you around.
- All right. Check you later.

659
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:16,278
- Bye.
- Later.

660
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,282
Slater, man, why are you
always such a dork, man?

661
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,478
- What are you talkin' about?
- "Check you later. " "Check you later. "

662
00:45:22,588 --> 00:45:24,556
Hey, man. Get off my case, man.

663
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:27,523
Oh, man. Chicks don't
want to hear that shit.

664
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:29,617
Well, they don't want
to hear anything, man.

665
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:33,494
The g The girls, man, in our
classes ?They're all prudes, man.

666
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,726
- They're worthless little bitches, man.
- Oh, my God ?

667
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,962
It's the girls ahead of us. They were
wild. Our class is just worthless.

668
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:42,973
Maybe you've just never gotten past the sniffing
butt stage. That's what that sounds like to me.

669
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:46,272
Hey, man. It's ?It's quality,
not quantity. All right, man?

670
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:50,178
And And wait till I get to college,
man. I can't wait to get to college, man.

671
00:45:50,282 --> 00:45:53,308
Yeah. When I get to college, all I'm
gonna do is bang, bang, bang, bang.

672
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,401
Hey, Hirshfelder. Let's go. Come on.

673
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:23,538
Yeah. Let's go. Let's get out of here.

674
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:25,776
- Let's go.
- Come on, man!

675
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,580
- What?
- It's time to leave.

676
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:31,053
I'll be right back.

677
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:43,224
Hey. You boys leave,
you can't come back.

678
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:45,895
Aw, gee. You hear that?

679
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,097
If we leave, we can't come back.

680
00:46:48,207 --> 00:46:50,107
Oh, no!

681
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:52,234
What should we do?

682
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:57,509
What the hell are we
doing? I was gettin' there.

683
00:46:57,616 --> 00:46:59,516
Man, I had my hand up her shirt.

684
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:02,348
- Oh, yeah.
- You were gettin' there?

685
00:47:02,454 --> 00:47:04,615
You hear that? He was gettin' there.

686
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:10,094
Son, you wouldn't know what to do with it even
if you had gotten there. So don't worry about it.

687
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,629
- Just 'cause you guys are striking out.
- Grow up, boy.

688
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:15,097
- That was our last junior high party.
- That's right.

689
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,000
We're in the big time now. We're freshmen,
where all the girls will be putting out.

690
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:22,005
Your days of lying around and
pulling tongue all night are over.

691
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:24,007
Yeah, right.

692
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,753
- You didn't know she stuffs her bra?
- Terry stuffs her bra?

693
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:46,626
- You didn't know those were socks? Shit.
- Yeah.

694
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,700
They looked real to me.

695
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:55,038
- Oh, shit.
- Scatter!

696
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:03,113
This one right here! Come
here, baby! We got you, baby!

697
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,149
Whoo!

698
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,309
All right. Get out there. Go, baby. Go.

699
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:11,954
Come here. Come here,
you little fag. Come here.

700
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,957
- Come on.

701
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,256
Get over here. Where
you running to, boy, huh?

702
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,489
We ain't gonna hurt you ?much.

703
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,625
Just hold onto that fence there, all
right, and just squeal like a pig.

704
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:27,805
- You ready to
switch-hit? - Oh, yeah.

705
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,636
I'm first.

706
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:40,214
Geez. Bastards.

707
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,150
Hey, you guys.

708
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,330
Take it easy on the kid, would you?

709
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:54,661
Here comes another one,
freshman. You ready?

710
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,666
- Ladies.
- You like that?

711
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,703
One more for my mother.

712
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:03,532
Hey. Who is that kid?

713
00:49:03,642 --> 00:49:07,908
What? That kid there? Just some kid we saw running
around that shouldn't have been, by the rec center.

714
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:10,243
Hey. Can we have some of those beers?

715
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:13,182
- One of these?
- Yeah.

716
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:15,753
- Why?
- Just give me a beer.

717
00:49:15,854 --> 00:49:18,118
- Get out ofhere, I said!
- Yeah?

718
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:20,123
Catch. Huh? Hmm?

719
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:23,126
Tubbs, catch. Good. Get out ofhere.

720
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:26,026
- What are you wasting a beer on him for?
- What?

721
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:29,693
- It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
- Give 'em a beer.

722
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,769
Man, this fuckin' sucks. All right?

723
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,169
Last fuckin' day of school.
No fuckin' party. No fuckin' ?

724
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,470
- You just wasted another fuckin' beer.
- Oh, shut up.

725
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:41,478
Thanks.

726
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,912
- Hmm.
- Hey.

727
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,650
So, which one of your friends
bought you the beer this time?

728
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:51,655
- Right.
- Hey! Fuck her! I did!

729
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:54,885
- Yeah, bite me!
- You wish, asshole!

730
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,893
Fuck you!

731
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,725
Why are guys such pigs?

732
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,731
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

733
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,393
Mmm. We're out of here.

734
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:07,472
Let me tell you what Melba
Toast is packin'right here.

735
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,668
We got 411 positrack out back, 750
double pumper, Edelbrock intakes...

736
00:50:11,777 --> 00:50:16,680
Ford over-30, 11-to-1 pop-up
pistons, Turbo-jet 390 horsepower.

737
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,977
We're talkin' some fuckin' muscle.

738
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:21,848
Hey, man, I know you got this
thing out of a comic book.

739
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:24,854
I saw the ad ?2.95. It was
right next to the sea monkeys.

740
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:26,856
You see that over there?
That's white lightning.

741
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,984
You see the shoes on that thing? You gotta
get some tires. These are pizza cutters.

742
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:34,588
Yeah.

743
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,031
- Ow.
- You're such an expert.

744
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:39,831
This is sad. Shouldn't we
be doing something else?

745
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:41,838
Yeah. Like what?

746
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,840
- I'm bored.
- You're always bored.

747
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:45,671
- Let's split.
- Where you wanna go?

748
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:47,301
Then you're boring.

749
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:49,312
- Pink!
- Hey.

750
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,905
Hey. You hear anything
more about a beer bust?

751
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:55,612
- Talk to this man right here.
- Patience, darlin', patience.

752
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,620
- Hey.
- Hey.

753
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:02,182
- What are you doing here?
- I was just about to ask you the same question.

754
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:04,455
- I heard you got busted.
- Oh, yeah.

755
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,463
They just got Hirshfelder too.

756
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,055
- Really?
- Yeah.

757
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,134
- Like, how bad?
- Bad.

758
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,870
- Was it O'Bannion?
- Yeah.

759
00:51:13,972 --> 00:51:16,372
God, I hate that jerk.

760
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:18,534
I know.

761
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:21,203
So, um ?

762
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:23,508
What have you guys been doin'? Just ?

763
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:26,709
I don't know. Driving around, mostly.

764
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:29,048
I didn't know thatJodi
was your big sister.

765
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:31,554
- Oop.
- Hey, did I hear my name over here?

766
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,420
You guys talkin' about me? Hey, kiddo.

767
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,085
Heard they got you pretty bad.

768
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:41,825
And I asked them to take it easy on
you. I can't believe they did that.

769
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,401
Man! God! No wonder!

770
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:49,065
Pink, what happened?

771
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:51,074
So, where'd they find Hirsh?

772
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:54,077
I don't know. Walking out
of the rec center, I think.

773
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,079
- Hey.

774
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,673
- What have you guys been doin'?
- Pink, right?

775
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,086
Hi!

776
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:05,088
Ohh!

777
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,158
Hi.

778
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,296
Whew.

779
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:15,833
Face it. You got busted
because you couldn't get away.

780
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:17,902
You try and outrun
O'Bannion and those guys.

781
00:52:18,003 --> 00:52:21,564
I'm gonna be laughin' my ass off when it's
your turn, when they're busting your ass.

782
00:52:21,673 --> 00:52:24,005
Hey, man, I heard last year...

783
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:26,270
they caught about 10 freshmen at once.

784
00:52:26,378 --> 00:52:29,279
O'Bannion backed his truck over
some pizzas and made 'em eat it, man.

785
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:31,281
I mean, that's bullshit. Right?

786
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:34,284
Idiot flunks his senior year so he
can be a dick two years in a row?

787
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:36,286
Is that legal?

788
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:38,356
Damn you, Carl!

789
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:47,297
Ohh! Okay. Let me out.

790
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:50,732
Hey, Slater, you fuckin'
hippie! Give me drugs, man!

791
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,303
Get some from your mother, man.

792
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:56,306
- Yeah, we just banged your mother.
- Okay. Fuck you, dickhead.

793
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,813
Those guys, man. Man of the woods. What's
goin' on? God, I haven't seen you in so long.

794
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:04,814
My man, what is happenin'?

795
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,282
Long time no see.

796
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,320
- What have you been up to?
- Same old shit, man.

797
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:12,754
- Workin' for the city.
- Workin' man, huh?

798
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,690
Been thinkin' about gettin'
back in school though, man.

799
00:53:15,794 --> 00:53:18,126
- Back in J.C., somethin' like that?
- Yeah, man.

800
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:21,630
I mean, that's where
all the girls are, right?

801
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,634
But on the other hand, man,
I'd just as soon keep workin'.

802
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:27,637
- Keep a little change in my pocket.
- Yeah? Wait.

803
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:31,641
Rather than spend my time listenin' to some dipshit
who doesn't know what he's talkin' about anyway.

804
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:33,711
I know what you're talkin' about.

805
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,880
- Say, you're a freshman, right?
- Yeah.

806
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:40,884
All right, so tell me, man. How's this
year's crop of freshman chicks lookin'?

807
00:53:42,988 --> 00:53:46,389
Wood, you're gonna end up in jail sometime
really soon. I know that for a fact.

808
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:48,891
No, man. No, let me tell you.

809
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:53,260
That's what I love about
these high school girls, man.

810
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:56,163
I get older, they stay the same age.

811
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:58,167
Yes, they do.

812
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,169
Yes, they do.

813
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,638
- You guys wanna go for a spin?
- Shotgun!

814
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:05,710
Aw.

815
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:08,574
- Woods.
- I'm here, man.

816
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,580
You wanna come along?

817
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:12,582
Yeah. Why not?

818
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:15,812
- Take care, bro.
- You boys have fun now.

819
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,650
Listen, I'm gonna give you shotgun.

820
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:22,454
But I want you to know it's because
?only 'cause I'm goin' inside.

821
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,859
- Keep that in mind. All right?
- Okay. Got it.

822
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:32,059
- Hey, man, whose bowling ball is this?
- It's yours, man.

823
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,570
- Slater.
- Hey, man. What's happening?

824
00:54:34,673 --> 00:54:36,800
- Play a little foosball?
- Yeah!

825
00:54:57,195 --> 00:54:59,026
Junior.

826
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:05,727
Pull over to the trash can.

827
00:55:05,837 --> 00:55:08,738
Pull over to the trash can!
Pull over to the trash can!

828
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,364
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme ?

829
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:22,885
Okay. Okay. Oh!

830
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,716
Shit, yeah!

831
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:31,259
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

832
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,489
Hey, you guys, pull over
to that one over there.

833
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:35,657
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Here, hold this. Hold this.

834
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:43,301
- I got it! Go! Go!
- Guess what.

835
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:45,808
It's garbage day!

836
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:49,609
Yeah!

837
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:52,683
We're fuckin'runnin'!

838
00:55:53,952 --> 00:55:56,250
Yeah! Whoo!

839
00:55:56,354 --> 00:56:00,188
- Whoo!
- Oh, my?

840
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,192
Bowling ball.

841
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:05,262
- Yeah!
- Throw the bowling ball.

842
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:07,331
Think I should?

843
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:09,696
- Yeah! Throw it!
- Throw it! Throw it!

844
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:12,326
Come on. You're playin'with

Do it! Throw it! Faggot-sissy-pussy

846
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,605
- Throw it!

847
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:25,582
Fuck 'em!

848
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:30,347
That bowling ball said "Oof!"
To that damn windshield!

849
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:33,481
- Yeah! - Ha-ha!
You're nuts, junior!

850
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,491
You're nuts!

851
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,493
Hey, man, we're out ofbeer.

852
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,621
- We gotta make a Grab-'N'-
Go stop. - Fuck that.

853
00:56:40,732 --> 00:56:43,257
- I don't have any money. Who's got money?
- I gave mine to him.

854
00:56:43,368 --> 00:56:45,268
Where's your money? Nah, doesn't matter.

855
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,531
Pull in heading out that way.

856
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,070
- What are you gonna do, man? Hoist it?
- Yeah. That all I ever do.

857
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,581
- I just need the freshman as a lookout.
- I don't wanna get in trouble. Do you, Randall Pink?

858
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:01,151
- I don't know about this, Don.
- Come on.

859
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,389
I don't wanna see you.

860
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,755
Better be careful, junior.

861
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,456
- Sunflower seeds.
- Zigzags!

862
00:57:12,564 --> 00:57:15,533
- Zigzags.
- Hey, man, I'm not too sure about this.

863
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,966
Shh. I'm really gonna pay for it. I'm
just messin' around with them. Okay?

864
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:22,039
Good.

865
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,822
Run! Go, go, go, go, go!

866
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,553
Come on, guys! We gotta get

867
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,891
- Let's go!

868
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:48,966
All right, now don't try anything,
or I'll shoot the shit out of ya.

869
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:52,867
- Don, give the beer back, man.
- I paid for the beer, man.

870
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,402
Busted my mailbox, didn't you?

871
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,475
Look me in the eye, punk!

872
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:02,068
I don't know what you're talking
about, sir, but I suggest that you ?

873
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,943
You busted it, didn't ya?

874
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:11,322
Tamperin' with mailboxes
is a felony offense.

875
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:15,820
- I done called the police.

876
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:18,623
I think you boys oughta
get out of the car.

877
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,722
- Just go, man.
- Nice and slow.

878
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,758
Go, go, go!

879
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,969
Whoo!

880
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:31,602
Get down!

881
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:33,973
He's shooting at us! Holy?

882
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,643
Fairly uneventful, huh?

883
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,487
Which one of you had the theory...

884
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:47,490
about how President Ford's
old football head injuries...

885
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:49,492
is affecting the economy?

886
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:52,995
- Did you know Ford was on the Warren Commission?
- Who cares? He's out of there this fall.

887
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:54,997
Look, we need some alcohol.

888
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,590
That's a thought.

889
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:25,795
Say, man.

890
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:29,128
Why don't you run over to the Centennial
and pick me up a sixer of this stuff.

891
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,724
Think you can do that?

892
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:34,937
- Thanks, man.
- Good luck!

893
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:40,641
I'm just saying, if we're gonna drive
around, we should just do something ?Ohh!

894
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,645
Yeah. You know, you're right, man.

895
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:47,650
I'm just gonna, you know, get drunk,
maybe get laid, or get in a fight.

896
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,186
No, I'm serious, man! We
should be up for anything!

897
00:59:50,288 --> 00:59:52,188
I know. We are. But what?

898
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:56,727
I mean, God, don't you ever feel like everything
we do and everything we've been taught...

899
00:59:56,828 --> 00:59:58,728
is just to service the future?

900
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,094
Yeah, I know. It's like
it's all preparation.

901
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:03,997
Right. But what are we
preparing ourselves for?

902
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:06,229
- Death.
- Life of the party.

903
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,237
It's true.

904
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,239
You know, but that's valid.

905
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:14,243
Because if we're all gonna die anyway,
shouldn't we be enjoying ourselves now?

906
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:17,337
You know? I'd like to quit thinking
of the present ?like, right now ?

907
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:21,077
as some minor, insignificant
preamble to somethin' else.

908
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:26,748
Exactly! That's what everybody in this car needs
?some good old, worthwhile visceral experience.

909
01:00:27,859 --> 01:00:30,919
Remember to eat a green thing every day.

910
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:32,929
And have lots of calcium.

911
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:36,432
It's very important for young
mothers to have lots of calcium.

912
01:00:36,534 --> 01:00:39,594
- There you are. See you tomorrow night.
- Bye.

913
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:43,299
- How are you this evening?
- Pretty good. How's it goin'?

914
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:46,309
Be goin' a lot better when I
get off in a couple of hours.

915
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:48,379
Yeah, I hear that.

916
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,008
- You're 18, right?
- Oh, yeah.

917
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,646
- Just graduated.
- Graduated. Congratulations.

918
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:03,056
- So, you off to college in the fall?
- Uh, you know, I'm still not sure.

919
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:05,527
I'm workin' right now for the city.

920
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:11,066
Thinkin' of holding on to the job for a
while. You know, it's money in my pocket.

921
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:13,933
I hear that. Here's some
more money for your pocket.

922
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,802
- You have a nice night tonight.
- Okay. Thanks.

923
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:19,376
Hey, take it easy.

924
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:23,570
Psst! Hey, Mitch.

925
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:27,650
Hey. There you guys are.

926
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:30,778
- Hey, man, what's in the bag?
- Ah, a sixer.

927
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,822
- You owe me one, man.
- Yeah.

928
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:34,892
They busted the hell
out of Hirshfelder too.

929
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:37,859
- Yeah, I heard.
- Hey, man, you're over at the Emporium?

930
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:41,762
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, is that bastard O'Bannion over there?

931
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:44,960
Yes. I hate that jerk.

932
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,831
Do you guys wanna get him back?

933
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,373
- Hell yes.
- Yeah!

934
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,477
They really sold it to you?

935
01:02:01,586 --> 01:02:03,554
- Of course.
- Cool.

936
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,325
There you go, buddy.

937
01:02:10,428 --> 01:02:13,192
Whoo! Paycheck. Oh, yeah.

938
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:15,697
- Way to shoot, man.
- Thanks, bud.

939
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,701
Oh, yeah. He got it.

940
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:21,704
- I got your change.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.

941
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:24,206
- Got a beer for my partner.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:26,208
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

943
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,210
- All right.
- Guys.

944
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,712
- Party at the moon tower.
- Oh, I'm there.

945
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:33,875
You and Benny pick up the first keg.
I'm goin' to collect for the rest.

946
01:02:33,985 --> 01:02:35,885
Spread the word, man.

947
01:02:35,987 --> 01:02:37,887
Max, Phil, party at the moon tower.

948
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:40,651
Hey, good game, man. You too.

949
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,158
Y'all are an embarrassment
to the sport of pool...

950
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:46,355
and you should be proud that I
even let you play at my table.

951
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:49,365
You are the worst pool player
I've ever seen in my life...

952
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:52,698
but if you keep watchin'me
you might learn somethin'!

953
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,931
Shit, you got so many balls on the table, I'm
gonna have to start knockin'your balls in...

954
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,940
just to get 'em out of my way.

955
01:02:58,042 --> 01:02:59,942
- Okay.
- Corner pocket.

956
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:01,944
- Hey, check this out.
- Easy money.

957
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,946
God, you are terrible!

958
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:08,747
Okay, homo, I hope you are ready to taste
the agonizing, bitter humiliation of defeat.

959
01:03:08,853 --> 01:03:10,753
You ready?

960
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:13,756
So, did you hear they're
busting Carl Burnett out back?

961
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:15,758
- Whoa-whoa. What did
you say? - About what?

962
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,352
- Carl Burnett. What about him?
- I just heard he's gettin' busted. I don't know.

963
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,363
Benny, they got Burnett
in the back. Let's go.

964
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,228
- Carl Burnett? Outside?
- Yeah. They got him.

965
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:25,234
- Let's go.
- Let me finish this game.

966
01:03:25,336 --> 01:03:27,236
- Fine. I'm gettin' out.
- Hold him for me!

967
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,203
All right, all right!

968
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:33,844
Hey, man. ThatJulie chick? Loves you.

969
01:03:33,945 --> 01:03:35,845
Oh, yeah. You want her?

970
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:38,848
Gotta play it cool, you know. Can't
let her know how much you like her.

971
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,851
'Cause if she knows, she'll
dump you like that. Believe me.

972
01:03:41,953 --> 01:03:46,720
If she asks you to ride out there with her,
you don't do it. Say, "Nah. Got my own ride.

973
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,724
But maybe I'll see you later. "

974
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:51,056
Sounds stupid, doesn't it? It works.

975
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,892
Whoo-ee! Whee! We got
another one, huh, fellas?

976
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:57,900
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Guys, guys. You
wouldn't mind if I went first, would ya?

977
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,902
Is that all right?

978
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:03,838
It's kind of a personal thing between
me and this little piece of shit here.

979
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,842
So... we meet again, huh?

980
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:12,075
Did y'all hear this little motherfucker's
mom pulled a shotgun on me this afternoon?

981
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,083
Fuckin' bitch.

982
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:16,517
Y
- You haven't had any licks yet, have you?

983
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:18,521
- Hmm?
- No.

984
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:21,490
Whoo! Another cherry, boys.

985
01:04:21,592 --> 01:04:23,719
Man, get the fuck up against the wall!

986
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:27,764
You have to be the dumbest freshman,
skinny little cocksucking son of a bitch...

987
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,299
to be out here tonight.

988
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:32,301
You knew I was gonna find you.

989
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:35,304
I would like to dedicate
this first lick...

990
01:04:35,406 --> 01:04:37,499
to your mother...

991
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:39,576
fucker.

992
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,380
Not yet.

993
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:46,382
Oh! It's gettin' warmer.

994
01:04:46,484 --> 01:04:48,452
What the fuck?

995
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,958
Remember me, you pig?

996
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:02,461
#I walked through the halls ofkarma #

997
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,466
Let's go, man! Come on!

998
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,594
What the fuck is the matter with
you? How 'bout some fucking backup?

999
01:05:07,705 --> 01:05:09,605
- Let's go!
- I'm hurryin'!

1000
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:11,607
Fuckin'scumbags!

1001
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:14,906
It was beautiful! You should have
seen the look on that fuck's face!

1002
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:16,912
- Get in!
- We got that bastard!

1003
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:24,113
Jesus! You let that
little fuck get away!

1004
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,917
What is the matter with
you? It's fuckin' pitiful!

1005
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,083
Fuck!

1006
01:05:29,193 --> 01:05:31,559
Freshman shitheads.

1007
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:34,324
What the fuck are you lookin' at? Huh?

1008
01:05:34,432 --> 01:05:36,900
I'll kick your fuckin' ass right now!

1009
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:40,069
Pussy.

1010
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:48,608
What are you smilin' at, you
little freshman faggot? Huh?

1011
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:52,542
Fuck you.

1012
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,948
Fuck all of you! Fuck you!

1013
01:05:57,188 --> 01:05:59,156
Goddamn it!

1014
01:06:05,563 --> 01:06:07,463
Oh, man!

1015
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:11,160
O'Bannion finally got
his paint job Whoa!

1016
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,380
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1017
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,882
I swore to God I'd never
come to a Top Notch...

1018
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:30,420
and here I am sorting through
jalapeo burgers and soggy fries.

1019
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,421
Here, take 'em.

1020
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:36,289
- All right, all right!
- Oh, Christ.

1021
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:39,522
How ya doin'?

1022
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:42,155
- Pretty good.
- Cool.

1023
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:44,700
You heard about the
party bein' busted, right?

1024
01:06:44,802 --> 01:06:47,703
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Not to worry.

1025
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,706
There's a new fiesta in
the making as we speak.

1026
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,708
It's out at the moon tower.

1027
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,405
Full kegs. Everybody's gonna
be there. You oughta go.

1028
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:58,414
Okay.

1029
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:00,347
- Okay, we'll be there.
- Okay.

1030
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,113
- Say, you need a ride?
- Uh, no, I got my own car.

1031
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,120
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well, listen.

1032
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:08,123
You oughta ditch the two geeks you're
in the car with now and get in with us.

1033
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:11,126
But that's all right. We'll
worry about that later.

1034
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:14,857
- I will see you there. All right?
- Bye.

1035
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:17,297
I love those redheads, man.

1036
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,801
I know you!

1037
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:22,532
We had geography together. Remember?

1038
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,837
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God.

1039
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:27,843
What a dick!

1040
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:30,345
That was so creepy.

1041
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:33,349
- Why are you smiling?
- I thought he was cute.

1042
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,851
- Oh, that's disgusting!
- You thought he was cute?

1043
01:07:35,953 --> 01:07:38,854
Do you realize when he graduated
we were, like, three years old?

1044
01:07:38,956 --> 01:07:42,084
Oh, Cynthia, what are you thinking?

1045
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:44,093
I don't know.

1046
01:07:44,195 --> 01:07:47,096
So, are we gonna still go?

1047
01:07:47,198 --> 01:07:49,291
- Yeah, what the hell.
- I guess.

1048
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,708
Ohh! Get back!

1049
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:15,324
Hey, Wood is here for
the quarter race, baby!

1050
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:18,259
- Hey, Benny. You better have your wood screws ?
- Fuck you!

1051
01:08:18,362 --> 01:08:20,990
'Cause I'm gonna blow
your doors completely off!

1052
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:57,727
Yeah!

1053
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:37,906
Well, someone's tokin' some reefer.

1054
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,010
Take care of this.

1055
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:44,239
Hey, man. Hey. Slow down. What's up?

1056
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,816
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- What'd you just say?

1057
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,475
When?

1058
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:52,078
Just now, man, when you
walked past. What'd you say?

1059
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,679
A
- About what?

1060
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:57,317
You said, "Someone's
tokin' some reefer. "

1061
01:09:57,428 --> 01:10:00,420
No, I may have said something
about smelling some pot.

1062
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,261
- You know, it was just an observation.
- Oh, an observation, huh?

1063
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:06,359
Well, who the hell are you,
man? Isaac fuckin' Newton?

1064
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,337
Well, guess what, genius. I'm the
one smoking marijuana, motherfucker.

1065
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,704
- You got a problem with that?
- No. Of course not.

1066
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:16,610
Then why'd you say that, chief? Don't let
your mouth write a check your butt can't cash.

1067
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:19,148
So I'm blazin' with my friends.
So I'm a fuckin' pothead, man.

1068
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:22,650
What's it to you? Huh? What's the
matter, pussy? Out of observations?

1069
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:25,950
Why don't you observe while I punch
your teeth down your fuckin' throat!

1070
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:28,957
Dude, relax! Relax!
He's cool, man. Relax.

1071
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:32,551
Hey, I'll be watching you, Newton. I
only came here to do two things, man.

1072
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:35,097
Kick some ass and drink some beer.

1073
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,657
Looks like we're almost out of beer.

1074
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:42,000
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

1075
01:10:47,144 --> 01:10:49,544
Why is it called the moon tower, anyway?

1076
01:10:49,647 --> 01:10:55,017
Uh, I guess they decided to put it up out here
whenever they were building the power plant.

1077
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,019
Actually, it's a good idea.

1078
01:10:57,121 --> 01:11:00,522
You got a full moon out here
every day of the year. You know?

1079
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:02,524
Yeah, but nothing's
ever been repaired...

1080
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:05,527
so this whole place could
fall down at any time.

1081
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:07,790
So you'd better watch your step, junior.

1082
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:14,200
This place used to be off limits, man,
'cause of some drunk freshman who fell off.

1083
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:18,035
He went right down the middle,
smackin' his head on every beam, man.

1084
01:11:18,142 --> 01:11:20,770
I hear it doesn't hurt after
the first couple, though.

1085
01:11:20,878 --> 01:11:24,109
Autopsy said he had one beer,
man. How many did you have?

1086
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:26,114
Four.

1087
01:11:26,216 --> 01:11:28,116
You're dead, man. You're so dead.

1088
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:31,381
Look at the bloodstains right there.

1089
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,456
Shut up.

1090
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:37,358
I'm gonna get that guy.

1091
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:40,760
- What guy?
- That asshole on the way in ?Clint.

1092
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:44,265
Super-dominant male in
a '50s greaser uniform.

1093
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:46,268
I wouldn't suggest that, Mike.

1094
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,270
Look, man, I got it all planned out.

1095
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:51,273
Most fights in places like this never get
past a punch or two before they're broken up.

1096
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,276
There's almost a natural
instinct not to upset the herd.

1097
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:57,279
So all I gotta do is get in one
good punch, play defense and wait.

1098
01:11:57,381 --> 01:12:00,282
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1099
01:12:00,384 --> 01:12:03,285
I- I-I guess at first I was relieved
to get out of the situation...

1100
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,787
but now there's this level
of humiliation setting in...

1101
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,289
that I can tell is gonna
be with me for-fucking-ever!

1102
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:10,792
I'm just not gonna let this
be yet another situation...

1103
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:13,988
which contributes to me being a little,
ineffectual nothing the rest of my life.

1104
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:20,168
Would you look at
this fucking town, man.

1105
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,431
It's dead.

1106
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:28,409
Imagine how many people out
there right now are fucking, man.

1107
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,414
Step inside my head ?

1108
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,950
Just goin' at it.

1109
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:40,449
- Hey.
- Hey.

1110
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,957
- Remember me?
- Sure. You're Sabrina, right?

1111
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,652
Right.

1112
01:12:44,762 --> 01:12:46,662
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

1113
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:48,823
- Hey, let's go.
- What brings you here?

1114
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:51,400
Oh, just hanging out.

1115
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:55,834
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

1116
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,839
Yeah.

1117
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:01,502
So, uh ?does your offer from
this afternoon still stand?

1118
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:06,674
What am I say supposed to
say? "Anything you want. "

1119
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:18,026
Why did we even come here?

1120
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:21,029
I always feel a little out of
place at these things, you know.

1121
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:23,622
You're telling me. I'm
being stalked by a Nazi.

1122
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:26,635
Is that a little bit of
reefer I smell on you, boy?

1123
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:29,171
Coach is right. You're runnin'
with that bad crowd again.

1124
01:13:29,273 --> 01:13:32,174
You've got an attitude adjustment
you've gotta make right now.

1125
01:13:32,276 --> 01:13:35,575
Like I'm the only athlete at this
fuckin' party. Look at you two drunks.

1126
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,171
Coach is right, though. Those guys
don't care if we win or lose, bro.

1127
01:13:39,283 --> 01:13:41,649
Just remember that.

1128
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:43,652
- Check this out. Watch this ?
- Yeah?

1129
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:47,190
Watch me get this beer. Watch.

1130
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:49,191
Oh, no! It's the cops!

1131
01:13:49,293 --> 01:13:51,090
- Look! Look!
- Shit!

1132
01:13:51,195 --> 01:13:53,095
Look, look, look! That was so easy.

1133
01:13:53,197 --> 01:13:57,361
Oh, shit. He needs another
drink, you know, bad.

1134
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:10,747
All right!

1135
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,406
Hey! Mitch!

1136
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,409
- Hey!
- How's it goin'?

1137
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,411
I was wondering if you were around here.

1138
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:47,541
Oh, man!

1139
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:51,747
So, uh, I just wanted
to talk, you know...

1140
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:53,823
about you quittin' football.

1141
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:56,925
Or is it just this pledge?

1142
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:59,928
You don't wanna sign the
pledge, right? That's what it is.

1143
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,555
I don't know, man.

1144
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:06,696
Maybe I'm not into any of it anymore.

1145
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:10,573
- You're not into any of it anymore.
- Yeah.

1146
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:16,878
It'd be the biggest mistake of your
life, Pink. No one quits senior year, pal.

1147
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,710
Especially if you're
starting quarterback.

1148
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:22,876
I mean, we got a shot at state.

1149
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:25,454
We'll kick some butt this year.

1150
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:30,126
It's what we've been working
for all of our lives, man.

1151
01:15:30,227 --> 01:15:33,560
Me and you. Benny. We're
gonna be champions together.

1152
01:15:33,664 --> 01:15:38,931
Look, man, all I'm saying is
that if I do play next year...

1153
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:41,937
it's gonna be on my terms, not theirs.

1154
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:44,735
You just remember one thing, Pink?

1155
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:48,709
it ain't just about you, pal,
it's about us ?me, Donny, Mel.

1156
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:51,508
You'd be fuckin' us over.

1157
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:53,674
Or maybe you'rejust fuckin'scared, huh?

1158
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:57,387
Have a nice night.

1159
01:16:41,465 --> 01:16:44,366
Do you guys know what that song's about?

1160
01:16:44,468 --> 01:16:46,436
It's about aliens.

1161
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:51,337
We're the aliens,
man. We're the savages.

1162
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,274
- We're the savages.
- Wait, man. That song is about that?

1163
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:57,211
- Yeah, man, that song's about that.
- About aliens?

1164
01:16:57,314 --> 01:16:59,214
Yeah, man. You didn't know that?

1165
01:16:59,316 --> 01:17:03,514
This country's founded ?It was founded
by people who were into aliens, man.

1166
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:08,250
George Washington, man, he was in a
cult, and the cult was into aliens, man.

1167
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:10,258
- You didn't know that?
- No.

1168
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,885
Oh, man, they were way into
that type of stuff, man.

1169
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:15,624
It's like the every-other-decade
theory. You know?

1170
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:19,293
The '50s were boring, the '60s rocked...

1171
01:17:19,403 --> 01:17:22,031
and the '70s ?Oh, my
God, they obviously suck.

1172
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:24,039
Right? Come on.

1173
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,439
Maybe the '80s will
be radical. You know?

1174
01:17:26,543 --> 01:17:30,035
I figure we'll be in our 20s
and, hey, it can't get any worse.

1175
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:49,898
Wait a minute.

1176
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,400
Who put the keg way
out here in the woods?

1177
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:55,403
I don't know. This is just
where they told me it would be.

1178
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:57,905
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1179
01:17:58,008 --> 01:18:00,476
- Huh.
- I don't think we need beer anyway.

1180
01:18:03,213 --> 01:18:06,011
- George toked weed, man?
- Absolutely, George toked weed.

1181
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:09,017
Are you kidding me, man? He
grew fields of that stuff.

1182
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,019
That's what I'm talking about. Fields!

1183
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:15,080
- He grew that shit up at Mount Vernon, man.
- Mount Vernon? He grew it all over the country.

1184
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:18,093
He had people growin'it
all over the country.

1185
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:21,096
The whole country back then was
gettin'high. Let me tell you, man.

1186
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:23,826
'Cause?'Cause?'Cause he knew.
He was onto somethin', man.

1187
01:18:23,934 --> 01:18:28,166
He knew that it would be a good cash
crop for the Southern states, man...

1188
01:18:28,271 --> 01:18:30,171
so he grew fields of it, man.

1189
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:34,300
But you know what? Behind
every good man there's a woman.

1190
01:18:34,411 --> 01:18:36,311
And that woman was
Martha Washington, man.

1191
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:40,315
And every day, George would come home,
she'd have a big, fat bowl waiting for him...

1192
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:42,317
when he'd come in the door, man.

1193
01:18:42,419 --> 01:18:44,444
She was a hip ?a hip, hip lady, man.

1194
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,365
Mm-mmm. Wait a minute.

1195
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,370
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1196
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:04,702
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1197
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:06,776
Don't you have a girlfriend?

1198
01:19:09,346 --> 01:19:12,611
- What girlfriend?
- What's-her-name.

1199
01:19:12,716 --> 01:19:16,152
Simone. Hmm?

1200
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,590
And she was real cool too.

1201
01:19:22,692 --> 01:19:25,593
She'd harvest the crops, man.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1202
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,596
She'd put it in the ?in the, um,
bushels and stuff and sell it, you know.

1203
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,599
Because they had to
make ends meet and stuff.

1204
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:34,101
I mean, did you ever look
at a dollar bill, man?

1205
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:38,334
There's some spooky stuff going on on
a dollar bill, man. And it's green too!

1206
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,341
- Later.
- See ya.

1207
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:43,344
- Cool.
- Wait, wait, wait. What was that all about?

1208
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,415
- What were you doin' back there, guy?
- Exactly what you two clowns wish you were doin'.

1209
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:48,416
- Look at him.
- Look at your boy.

1210
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,418
Kramer!

1211
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,014
Yeah, you, you, you. Freshman. Right
here. Come on. Right here, buddy.

1212
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:58,720
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. What is this wave shit?

1213
01:19:58,828 --> 01:20:02,025
- Freshman! Over here right now.
- Over here. Now.

1214
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:04,032
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

1215
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:07,035
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Shit. I should go.

1216
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:10,402
- Yeah, I guess you probably should.
- Shit. I'll be back.

1217
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:12,475
Okay.

1218
01:20:12,576 --> 01:20:14,976
- He's like a little Casanova.
- Yeah.

1219
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:17,478
- It's amazing. - Look at this
shit-eating grin on his face.

1220
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:19,981
- Was I right?
- Not bad for a little freshman.

1221
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,483
But you better watch
out for them older girls.

1222
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,486
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come
here, come here, come here.

1223
01:20:24,588 --> 01:20:27,785
All right, all right. We just
wanna know something. Okay?

1224
01:20:27,891 --> 01:20:31,793
Are you gonna be fuckin' that later,
or are you gonna be a little wimp? Huh?

1225
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:34,796
How do you know I haven't already?

1226
01:20:34,898 --> 01:20:37,799
Get outta here! I think
it's past your bedtime!

1227
01:20:37,901 --> 01:20:40,802
- Run along.
- Come here. Come here, come here.

1228
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:44,806
Why don't you go get a ride
with her. Say we left you.

1229
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:47,536
It'll work. It'll work. Go.

1230
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:50,272
- Hey, Kramer. Show it to her.
- Yeah.

1231
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,507
- Give it to her. Go!
- Go, boy.

1232
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,423
Air raid, freshman.

1233
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,425
What?

1234
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,586
Air raid, freshman.

1235
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:09,688
- Oh, come on, Darla. Leave her alone.
- No, Tony, this is between me and her.

1236
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:13,030
And she'd better be on the ground i
- in five seconds.

1237
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:18,106
Wait, she doesn't have to air-raid
because she's with me. Okay?

1238
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:22,277
Air-raid, or it's your ass.

1239
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:24,370
Don't do it, Sabrina.

1240
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:26,381
Oh, that's it...

1241
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:28,951
Miss Hot Stuff.

1242
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:34,879
I'm gonna make the next year
of your life a living hell.

1243
01:21:42,799 --> 01:21:45,029
Lick me! All of you!

1244
01:21:45,135 --> 01:21:47,695
Hey, Darla.

1245
01:21:47,804 --> 01:21:50,534
Good for you.

1246
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,541
Don't air-raid for that
bitch. I hate that shit.

1247
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:56,544
It's like that Clint fucker
in front of all his friends.

1248
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:58,876
- "Huh? Huh, motherfucker?"
- All right! Okay, Mike.

1249
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:00,973
Dominant male monkey motherfucker!

1250
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:03,712
God!

1251
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:06,721
T- A-R-A.

1252
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:10,224
I never met a Tara
before. You're my first.

1253
01:22:10,327 --> 01:22:12,420
Hey, what the ?

1254
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:15,259
All right!

1255
01:22:15,365 --> 01:22:18,528
- He did it! I can't believe it!
- Fuckin' knew I should have kicked your ass!

1256
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:21,297
Come on! Come on, man!

1257
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:23,895
- Come on! Hold still!
- Yeah!

1258
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:27,204
- Stop now!
- Oh, yeah! Hold still!

1259
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,574
- You guys, come on.
- It's that Clint. That crazy bastard.

1260
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,375
- You like this? You like this, motherfucker?
- Come on, Clint! Come on!

1261
01:22:32,482 --> 01:22:35,178
Where you goin'?

1262
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:41,621
Whoo-hoo! Kick his ass!

1263
01:22:41,725 --> 01:22:44,057
Come on, man! You want some
more? You fuckin' bitch!

1264
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,756
Come on, man! Come here!

1265
01:22:48,865 --> 01:22:51,026
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Get off him!

1266
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,762
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on!

1267
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:58,307
- Come on. Stay down!
- Fuckin' dick! You fucking fascist!

1268
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:01,639
You got fuckin' smoked! Come
on, man! You want some more?

1269
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:04,646
Fuckin' dick!

1270
01:23:32,242 --> 01:23:34,142
Hey.

1271
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:37,145
Hey, little brother.

1272
01:23:37,247 --> 01:23:39,647
- Is that a beer in your hand?
- Why, yes, it is.

1273
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:42,149
Have you had more than
one of those tonight?

1274
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:44,812
A few, I guess, but nobody's counting.

1275
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:47,822
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi.

1276
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:52,554
Guess I might as well just get used to you
being at the same social functions as me, huh?

1277
01:23:52,662 --> 01:23:55,062
And, uh, hanging out with people I know?

1278
01:23:55,165 --> 01:23:58,362
What time are you supposed
to be home, anyway?

1279
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:01,369
Oh, geez, I don't
know. Couple hours ago.

1280
01:24:01,471 --> 01:24:03,871
That's bullshit.

1281
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:06,305
That's major bullshit.

1282
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:09,310
Mom barely let me out of the
house when I was your age.

1283
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:11,312
- Aww!
- "Aww!"

1284
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:15,180
Don't think she's not gonna be waiting up for
you when you get home, because she will be.

1285
01:24:15,285 --> 01:24:18,186
- I've been through it, and she's tough.
- Yeah, well ?

1286
01:24:18,288 --> 01:24:21,746
Just don't ask her to
take it easy on me, please.

1287
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:27,324
What's that supposed to
mean? Take it easy on him?

1288
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,729
- Let's go smoke that joint.
- He's in for a surprise.

1289
01:24:39,509 --> 01:24:43,468
- # Tuesday's gone #

1290
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:47,072
# With the wind #

1291
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:53,915
- # Tuesday's gone with the wind ##
- All right! Good.

1292
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:56,491
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Hey, man, no worries.

1293
01:24:56,593 --> 01:24:58,493
- Take care.
- All right.

1294
01:24:58,595 --> 01:25:00,495
- Pick you up tomorrow, 4:00?
- Okay.

1295
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:02,497
Hey.

1296
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:05,329
Aerosmith. Three weeks.
Front row seats, babe.

1297
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:07,335
All right. I won't forget.

1298
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:12,340
So, uh, who's buying breakfast?

1299
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:14,342
- Not me.
- I will, I guess.

1300
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:16,344
- You coming along?
- Sure.

1301
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:18,346
- Night, John Boy. Ali.
- Good night.

1302
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,850
"Wood-a-been. "
What's going on?

1303
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,852
Pink, my man. What's happenin'?

1304
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:27,286
- Not a lot.
- Cynthia, man?

1305
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,654
- I like her, man. Very nice.
- Yeah?

1306
01:25:29,759 --> 01:25:32,387
- Red's a good color for you.
- My favorite color.

1307
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:35,589
- Have you seen Jodi around?
- Man, she left your ass.

1308
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:39,190
Really? Well, you win
some, you lose some.

1309
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:41,202
What about Peter Frampton?

1310
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:43,204
- I like him.
- Hey!

1311
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:46,366
- Slater, what's happenin', man?
- What's goin' on, man?

1312
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:48,706
- Guys, what's goin' on?
- Nothing!

1313
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:52,076
- Pickford, what do you know?
- What time is it? God.

1314
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:54,081
Let's go smoke a joint, man!

1315
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:58,882
On the 50-fuckin'- yard line, in
honor of your daddy, Coach Conrad.

1316
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:01,616
We're there! Great idea!

1317
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:04,215
- The man with the plan.
- Wanna come with me?

1318
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:06,227
Okay.

1319
01:26:06,329 --> 01:26:08,229
Hey.

1320
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:11,767
Joint subcommittee meeting on
the 50 yard line in 15. You there?

1321
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:13,893
- Okay.
- Don, y'all ride with me, man.

1322
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,903
Let's hit it.

1323
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:18,132
- This is cashed, man.
- It's in there, man.

1324
01:26:18,241 --> 01:26:21,335
You can ride with us, man, but you're
ridin' in the back, 'cause I got shotgun.

1325
01:26:21,444 --> 01:26:23,571
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah. - H-Hey!

1326
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:27,047
Hey, hey, hey! Watch the leather, man!

1327
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:31,118
Oh, fuck it!

1328
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:37,190
- Don't you quit! Do you wanna hit him?
- He was wide open!

1329
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:40,785
- Do you want to hit him?
- Jesus, son! You're wearing Rebel gray!

1330
01:26:40,897 --> 01:26:43,297
- Now, break down! Break down!
- I'm sorry, Coach.

1331
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:45,959
I want you on him like stink
on shit! I say, stink on shit!

1332
01:26:46,069 --> 01:26:49,129
Break down! You don't deserve
to wear that Rebel gray, boy!

1333
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:52,833
You don't deserve to wear it! You
won't hit him? You won't hit him?

1334
01:26:52,942 --> 01:26:55,502
O.T.S.S! Only the strong survive!

1335
01:26:55,612 --> 01:26:57,512
- Only the strong survive!
- Only the strong survive, boy!

1336
01:26:57,614 --> 01:26:59,844
- Only the strong survive!
- That's it!

1337
01:26:59,949 --> 01:27:02,850
Now, where's your pitch man?
Hit your goddamn pitch man!

1338
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:09,182
He fumbles!

1339
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:12,193
Hey, man!

1340
01:27:12,295 --> 01:27:15,196
Hell, my grandmother
can hit harder than that!

1341
01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:17,698
What the fuck, man?

1342
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,701
Course, she's an 8 foot 4,
652-pound, hairy-ass gorilla...

1343
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,896
drives a Mack truck
and runs the 40 in 10.2.

1344
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:27,636
Hell, she's gotten bigger lately,
man. She was only 6'2", 195 in my day.

1345
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,712
Still drives that Mack truck though.

1346
01:27:29,812 --> 01:27:31,837
Hey, Pink, you got my papers, man?

1347
01:27:31,948 --> 01:27:34,314
Uh, yeah, there's some
in my glove compartment.

1348
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:38,080
I got 'em. Hit me on a slant.
Give me the keys to an inside.

1349
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:40,087
Hut. Down!

1350
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:42,953
Marijuana on one!

1351
01:27:43,059 --> 01:27:44,959
Reefer on two!

1352
01:27:45,061 --> 01:27:47,962
Hut! Hut!

1353
01:27:48,064 --> 01:27:50,862
- Wide open!

1354
01:27:50,967 --> 01:27:52,594
I got it! Sweet!

1355
01:27:52,702 --> 01:27:56,069
Oh!

1356
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:58,072
That's pretty good.

1357
01:27:58,174 --> 01:28:00,074
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

1358
01:28:00,176 --> 01:28:03,737
Could be, like, a little ?I don't know.
Maybe perhaps a little more symmetrical.

1359
01:28:03,846 --> 01:28:05,746
- Does that hurt?
- Oww!

1360
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:07,748
- Yes! PI ?It ?
- Sorry. Sorry.

1361
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,750
- It's a bruise.
- Okay.

1362
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:12,252
I don't know. Let me ask
you something, though.

1363
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:14,915
I mean, I got some
pretty good ones in there.

1364
01:28:15,024 --> 01:28:18,050
I mean, it's not like I ?You wouldn't
say I got my ass kicked, right?

1365
01:28:18,161 --> 01:28:20,061
Oh, no. You know ?I don't know.

1366
01:28:20,163 --> 01:28:23,724
After a couple years, people won't
even remember, really, who won or lost.

1367
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,733
Yeah ?No, you're right.

1368
01:28:25,835 --> 01:28:28,736
You read about, like, Jackson
Pollock or Ernest Hemingway?

1369
01:28:28,838 --> 01:28:31,238
You never read about who won or
lost, just, they got into a brawl.

1370
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,240
Right. Exactly.

1371
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:36,243
Well, uh, thanks for the ride
and breakfast and everything.

1372
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:38,245
No problem.

1373
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:42,716
Sure is nice to pile on some pancakes and
syrup after a night of beer drinking, isn't it?

1374
01:28:46,022 --> 01:28:47,649
Um ?

1375
01:28:57,033 --> 01:28:59,331
Good night.

1376
01:29:11,981 --> 01:29:13,949
Good night.

1377
01:29:17,887 --> 01:29:20,583
- Hope you're not grounded or anything.
- Thanks.

1378
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:27,885
"Not to indulge in any alcohol,
drugs, sex after 12:00...

1379
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:29,897
or any other illegal activity?

1380
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:33,230
- Oh, not my shadow.
- Slater, pay me for that.

1381
01:29:33,336 --> 01:29:37,238
- Found that in your glove compartment, man.
- You're the third person who's given me this today.

1382
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,240
God.

1383
01:29:39,342 --> 01:29:41,742
What do you reckon you're gonna do?

1384
01:29:41,844 --> 01:29:45,177
I don't know. I'll probably end up signing
it. I just don't wanna give in so easy.

1385
01:29:45,281 --> 01:29:48,182
Man, it's the same bullshit
they tried to pull in my day.

1386
01:29:48,284 --> 01:29:52,345
If it ain't that piece of paper, it's some
other choice they're gonna try and make for ya.

1387
01:29:52,455 --> 01:29:56,949
You gotta do what Randall
"Pink" Floyd wants to do, man.

1388
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:02,759
And let me tell you this The older you do get, the
more rules they're gonna try to get you to follow.

1389
01:30:02,865 --> 01:30:06,494
You just gotta keep
livin', man. L- I-V-I-N.

1390
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:11,572
Man, if you're gonna
sign that paper, man...

1391
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:15,701
you should throw a little grass right in
the middle, roll it up, sign the joint, man.

1392
01:30:15,812 --> 01:30:20,215
- That's gonna tell 'em something.
- That's what I'll do. Assholes.

1393
01:30:20,316 --> 01:30:24,582
Yeah, they're all assholes. But think about it.
We've had a lot of good times right here, Pink.

1394
01:30:24,687 --> 01:30:27,588
Yeah, I mean, come on,
Pink. I can't believe this.

1395
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:31,091
You act like you're so oppressed.
Man, you guys are kings of the school.

1396
01:30:31,194 --> 01:30:34,220
You get away with whatever you
want. What are you bitching about?

1397
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:38,596
Look, all I'm saying is, if I ever start
referring to these as the best years of my life...

1398
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:41,795
remind me to kill myself.

1399
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:46,068
All I'm saying is, I just
wanna look back and say...

1400
01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:50,612
that I did it the best I could
while I was stuck in this place...

1401
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:54,410
had as much fun as I could when
I was stuck in this place...

1402
01:30:54,517 --> 01:30:57,850
played as hard as I could when
I was stuck in this place...

1403
01:30:57,954 --> 01:31:00,855
dogged as many chicks as I could
when I was stuck in this place.

1404
01:31:03,693 --> 01:31:06,594
Yeah, right, Mr. Premature Ejaculation.

1405
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:11,462
Oh, that's good. That's good.

1406
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:13,467
- That's good, baby.
- You know it's true.

1407
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:16,402
- Is that the cops?
- What the hell?

1408
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,939
- Oh, shit.
- Hey! All of you!

1409
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,941
Get over here!

1410
01:31:21,043 --> 01:31:22,943
- Now!
- Hey, man, ditch that pot.

1411
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,445
Is it illegal to be
on the football field?

1412
01:31:25,548 --> 01:31:28,449
- I got some more in this fuckin' bag.
- Dump it, dump it, dump it.

1413
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:30,451
Come on, Slater.

1414
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:32,453
What'd we do?

1415
01:31:32,555 --> 01:31:34,523
You got any Visine?

1416
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:38,156
Man, I can't believe this.

1417
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:42,755
If it ain't ol'Richard
Wrath. How you doin', Dick?

1418
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:47,962
Well, well, well. Couple
of football players.

1419
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:51,733
Wonder what Coach is
gonna think of all this.

1420
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:54,139
Line up.

1421
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:57,745
- Wooderson.
- Slavey.

1422
01:31:57,847 --> 01:32:01,578
Relivin' old glories
on the football field?

1423
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,584
Get through there!

1424
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:07,281
You shouldn't still be mad 'cause
I got all-district and you didn't.

1425
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:40,345
What?

1426
01:32:40,456 --> 01:32:43,653
Floyd! Dawson! Get your
scrawny butts over here.

1427
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:48,797
Mornin', Coach.

1428
01:32:50,733 --> 01:32:54,965
So what the hell's goin' on? Why am
I gettin' wake-up calls from the cops?

1429
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:57,972
- That was nothin'. They just left just now.
- False alarm, Coach.

1430
01:32:58,074 --> 01:33:00,042
Come here, Randy. Come here.

1431
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:04,575
You been out with
those losers all night?

1432
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,671
Hey, Coach Conrad.

1433
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:09,250
Remember me? Second period gym class?

1434
01:33:10,987 --> 01:33:13,387
That's the kind of people
I was telling you about.

1435
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:17,220
Trouble like this means nothing to that bunch
of clowns. You're the one with something to lose.

1436
01:33:17,326 --> 01:33:20,227
- Coach, you don't even know them.
- Randy?

1437
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:23,264
How can you even pretend
to talk that way? Huh?

1438
01:33:23,366 --> 01:33:27,598
Okay, Randy, I shouldn't do this, but I'm willing
to wipe the slate clean and forget about all this.

1439
01:33:27,703 --> 01:33:32,163
I want you to get your priorities straightened
out, quit hanging out with that bunch of hoodlums...

1440
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:34,708
and sign your commitment to your team.

1441
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:38,041
- Have you done that yet?
- I'm still thinkin' about it.

1442
01:33:38,147 --> 01:33:41,207
No one's paying you to think
about it. Just do it, son!

1443
01:33:42,952 --> 01:33:45,716
You know, Coach...

1444
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:47,721
I gotta get going.

1445
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:51,020
Me and my loser friends, we
gotta go get Aerosmith tickets.

1446
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:53,095
Top priority of the summer.

1447
01:33:57,166 --> 01:34:00,897
Oh, uh, Coach, uh, I forgot.

1448
01:34:03,706 --> 01:34:06,231
I might play ball...

1449
01:34:06,342 --> 01:34:08,310
but I will never sign that.

1450
01:34:18,888 --> 01:34:20,788
Let's rock and roll.

1451
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:24,951
All right, man! Livin'!

1452
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:28,394
Shit, I'm gettin' my third
wind. Let's get on the road.

1453
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:31,398
- Let's go. You gonna come, man?
- Shotgun!

1454
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,400
Talk to you later, then.

1455
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:36,596
- You guys not goin'?
- Can I use your keys?

1456
01:34:36,705 --> 01:34:38,969
- Yeah.
- Time to boogie on outta here.

1457
01:34:39,075 --> 01:34:40,975
- Hey.
- Let's do it.

1458
01:34:41,077 --> 01:34:43,045
So that's that, huh?

1459
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,147
All right.

1460
01:34:47,249 --> 01:34:49,615
Slate. Aah!

1461
01:34:49,718 --> 01:34:51,686
I never get shotgun.

1462
01:35:06,702 --> 01:35:09,034
Uh, hi, Mom.

1463
01:35:09,138 --> 01:35:11,902
Mmm, okay, Mitchell.

1464
01:35:13,109 --> 01:35:16,010
This is your one
get-out-of-jail-free card...

1465
01:35:16,112 --> 01:35:18,012

No.

1467
01:35:20,116 --> 01:35:23,643
Your sister told me everything, so
I've decided to make this deal with you.

come in at sunrise...

we've got problems.

1471
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:45,904
And, uh, who is this older
girl who gave you a ride?

She's just, like ?

Have you been drinking?

No!

I've got your final tests here.

Everybody did pretty well.
Uh, I'm gonna call your?

3

I'm headed this way.
我走这边

00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,060
- Later.
- 再见
- So, what did we decide?
- 我们有什么决定？

5
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,693
- About what?
- 决定什么？
- About tonight.
- 今晚的事
6
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:54,764
Oh, uh, look, I'll probably get, you know,
hung up with the guys maybe, you know, later.

7
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,844
- Why don't we just meet at the party?
- All right.

8
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:00,472
- Wouldn't want you waitin' around for me all night anyway.
- All right. Whatever.

Guess that makes you Deep Throat.

- So, is this a smoked or a liquid lunch?
- Hey.

00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:09,215
Smoked, right?

27
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:12,252
- So, guys, are we gonna play poker tonight?
- Count me out.

28
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,789
- Sure.
- Uh, I'll probably be going to Pickford's party later, okay? So ?

29
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,858
- No. We should do somethin' like that.
- Yeah.

30
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,621
- Goodwin's on his senior trip. We can play poker anytime.
- Go to a party?

- "Go to a p ?? Come on.
- Come on.

32

- Mike. Cynthia.
- It's under control.

33
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,830
- I don't feel comfortable at those kinds of things.
- Pick us up at 8:00.

34
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,834
- Okay. All right.
- It's gonna be all right.

- Guess we're going to the party. Okay.
- All right.

Oh, Mike. I gotta tell you about
this dream I had last night.

37

- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- But, um...

38
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,805
- you gotta promise not to tell anyone.
- Yeah, sure.

39
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:42,906
- No. Say, "I promise. "
- Jesus.

40
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,451
- I promise not to tell anyone.
- Okay, thank you.

41
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,453
Um, well ?

42
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,718
Okay, there I am, and
I'm gettin' it on ?

43
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:53,157
You know, with what had
this perfect female body.

44
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,161
Uh-huh.

45
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,356
But ?

46
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,729
- What? What? What?
- Um, I can't say.

47
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,826
Come on, man. You can't give a
buildup like that and not deliver.

48
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,770
I mean, come on. A perfect
female body. It's not a bad start.

49
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,232
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.

50

- Ah.
- I mean, the hat and the beard.

51
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:16,411
Oh, well. Best not think too
deeply on this one, right?

52
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,645
- Best not.
- Um, I gotta get some stuff from Mr. Birchfield.

53
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:23,884
- Uh, see you in a few minutes.

guy catches that huge wave and lands on the island?

- Oh, yeah! - Do you remember
that? - "Sexy surfer guy. "

00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,431
- The Mosquitoes. Do you remember that?
- Pink, let's go.

58
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,304
- Come on.
- They were a rock group. Ginger and Mary Ann formed their own group?

Look, man. I can't go yet
until Miss Wilk gets here.

60
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,343
- So why don't you go get Benny and check me out on the way back, okay?
- All right.

61
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:52,078
- What?
- Coach gave me something to give to you.

62
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,957
- They're really doing this.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:01,119
He wants them all back by the end of
the day too. Can you believe that one?

64
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,595
- And everybody's signing it?
- Just to get him off our back.

65
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,394
The coaches are just being fucking
assholes. Know what I'm saying?

66
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:10,198
I mean, you sign it, you never
think about it again. Just let it go.

67
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,104
- You're gonna make a big
deal out of this, aren't you?

68
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:19,604
You You're gettin' air from there,
man. It's no good. You see this?

69
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,614
It's gotta be tight.

70
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:25,709

around the base of that to get a good hit.

- Man, I ain't believin'that shit?
- Two minutes.

00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,159
About Bonham's one-hour drum solo.

75
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,136
One hour of drums? You couldn't
handle that shit on strong acid, man.

76
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:49,143
Okay.

77
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,105
Okay. We're gonna go to the bathroom.

78
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,182
Could you guys let Miss Wilks know?

79
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,383
All right. This is totally amazing.

80
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:03,048
"I voluntarily agree to not
indulge in any alcohol, drugs...

"or engage in any other

- What bullshit.
- The guys are actually signing this crap?

85
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,804
- Apparently.
- God, what are they gonna do next?

86
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,205
- Like, give you guys urine tests or something?
- I didn't know that drugs and alcohol...

87
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,972
were such a big problem that they
had to resort to neo-McCarthyism.

88
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,139
I think they're just afraid some of
us might be having too good a time.

89
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,308
It's the old age suppressing
youth thing, you know.

90
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:33,581
- "Neo-McCarthyism. " I like
that. - Oh, that's good, Tony.

91
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:37,419

you talking about, girl?

94

- Gilligan's Island?

95
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,968
It's what's called a
male pornographic fantasy.

96

- Oh, my?
- Think about it.

00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:55,197
You're basically alone on a deserted
island with two readily available women.

98
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,039
One, a seductive sex goddess type.

99
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:01,911
The other, a healthy girl-next-door
type with a nice butt.

100
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:04,746
So guys have it all. The
Madonna and the whore.

101
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,945
Women get nothing.

102
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:10,421
We get a geek, an
overweight middle-age guy...

103
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,458
some nerdy scientific type.

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,552
- I mean?
- The professor is sexy.

105
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,063
Pink, come on, man.

106
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,759
We're off to raise some hell.
Look at that. Look at that!

107
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,927
- Guys.
- Look at?

108
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,733
- All right. Let's go kick some ass.
- Hey, you guys.

109
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,740
- You guys, wait up.
- What?

110
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,469
- Benny.
- What?

111
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,636
- I have a favor to ask ya.
- What do you need?

112
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,680
Take it easy on my
brother this summer, okay?

113
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,681
- All of you.
- Mitch Kramer?

114
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,273
- Yeah. Mitch Kramer.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,582
- I'm gonna give him a beating he'll never forget.
- Ow!

116
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,521
Well, just don't get him more
than the other guys. Any of you.

117
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,990
- Kind of little. All right?
- Got our word, sis.

118
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,789
- Little brother'll be okay.
- Thanks. See you guys.

119
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,796
Ow!

120
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,923
Benny!

121
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:55,662

Oh, there's just a little bit
of bullshit in all that, right?

123
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,934
Major bullshit. He's a
dead man. He's fuckin' dead.

124
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,509
- Shotgun!
- Shotgun!

125
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,380
Check it out, boys, huh? I've been
waitin'three long years for this one.

126
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:13,544
- Oh, yeah.
- Thosejunior high kids are dead meat. I promise you.

127
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,748
- Beat 'em!
- Oh, man. Oh, yeah.

128
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,733
Okay, all you freshman fucks. Listen up.

129
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:33,637
It's your lucky day. Usually you'd be spending
your freshman summer getting your asses busted...

130
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,971
and running for your
worthless little lives...

131
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,409
but this year, because we
feel so sorry for you...

132
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,003
we're gonna take it easy on you...

133
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,174
and save us all a lot of time.

134
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:46,310
So, if you meet here ?right here ?

135
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,320
after school today...

136
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,788
you only get one lick from each of us.

137
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,825
But you run like cowards ?

138
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:57,523
well, it's open season
all summer long, boys.

139
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,191
Oh, yeah. Mitch Kramer?

140
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,031
Mitchy. Mitchy, Mitchy, Mitchy.

141
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,273
We're looking for you, pal.

142
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:08,899
Your ass will be purple
before the day is over.

143
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,011
Have a nice afternoon.

144
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,448
You better get out of town.

145
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,075
Go spend the summer with your
grandparents or somethin'.

146
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,218
Hey, man. You are gonna show up
to our game tonight, aren't you?

147
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:26,919
Yeah. I'm pitching. I kind of have to.

148
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,496
How should we inscribe your tombstone?

149
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,164
How about "Ben Over"?

150
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:36,828
Yeah, right, pissant. Why
aren't they after anybody else?

151
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,905
They are, man. Believe me.

152
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,906
I know, man.

153
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,442
- Come on, Mel. Hop on.
- Let's go, boy.

154
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,555
Oh, shit.

155
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,659
Hey, Coach.

156
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,886
So, tell me.

157
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:05,864
Any of you girls gonna be ready
to play some football this fall?

158
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,866
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know, Coach.

159
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:10,732
You know, uh, I been doing so good
in English classes, you know...

160
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,965
I figured I'd take next
fall off and become a writer.

161
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:15,042
What do you think about that, huh?

162
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:19,203
Boy, you wouldn't know how to write your
name if it wasn't stenciled on your locker.

163
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,771
No, seriously. Everybody. Now, don't
go getting soft on me this summer.

164
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:27,445
You know, you're sitting around the
pool all day, chasing the muff around.

165
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,682
Break down!

166
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,248
Hell, man. My grandmother's quicker
and tougher than you pansies.

167
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,260
Of course, she's 6'3", 250.

168
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,557
Runs a 4.540.

169
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,792
What's the matter with you, Floyd?

170
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,267
What, quarterbacks don't have to do
what their coaches say? Is that it?

171
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,634
Dawson, did you give
him that pledge sheet?

172
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,708
- The pledge sheet. You give it to him?
- Yeah, Coach. It's right here.

173
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,041
Randy, if you could get that back to us by the
end of the day, we'd feel a lot better about it.

174
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,479
- You guys see that he does this, okay?
- All right, Coach.

175
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,483
See ya, Coach.

176
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,019
- Randy Floyd.
- Aw, shit.

177
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:04,080
Before next fall, you're in need of a
serious attitude adjustment, young man.

178
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,091
You better get your priorities straight.

179
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:10,152
And watch out with that other crowd you're
runnin' with. Don't think I haven't noticed.

180
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,664
- Hey! -
Uh-oh, Pink.

181
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:17,328
I want that piece of paper on my desk
before you leave here today. Do you hear me?

182
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,974
Get an attitude adjustment.
You know what I mean?

183
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,777
- Priorities straight, buddy.
- Runs with a bad crowd.

184
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:31,784
- Bad people.
- Watch yourself.

185
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:37,791
Yeah, well, I've got Coach's and everybody
else's attitude-adjusted priorities...

186
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:40,292
right here.

187
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,362
- Yeah, that's good, Pink.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,129
Oh! Did you know O'Bannion flunked?

189
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,202
Yeah. What a dumb-shit.

190
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:56,206
Whoo! Y'all ready to bust some ass?

191
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,369
- What's up, Don? Benny. Melvin.
- Hey.

192
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,379
- See ya later.
- Good to see ya.

193
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,972
Yeah.

194
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,018
Hey. We gotta take your truck.
I'm low on gas. All right?

195
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,680
- We need to take my truck?
- Yeah. Okay?

196
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,689
- Yeah.
- Good.

197
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,123
- What are you doing? Picking up trash?
- What? What?

198
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:16,822
Man, I was just waiting for one of
them idiot coaches to piss me off again.

199
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:19,195
I think you take the whole
thing a little too personal.

200
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,030
I think you just gotta
?You gotta shake it off.

201
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:25,196
Don, have you ever thought
about why we play football?

202
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:29,265
I mean, how many times have you gotten laid
strictly because you're a football player, huh?

203
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,178
I don't know. A few probably.

204
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,182
A few? Don, all I'm saying is that...

205
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:41,243
I bet we could do just as well
if we were in a band or somethin'.

206
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,755
Well, I gotta put in a
final appearance. So ?

207
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,382
Wait a minute. Who you
got goin' in there? Shh.

208
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,062
Vicky. Vicky!

209
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:52,894
Come on. Let's skip out. Let's
go get naked right now. Let's go.

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,558
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

211
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,499
- Mr. Dawson.
- Yeah.

212
00:13:56,604 --> 00:13:58,504
Why don't you take it somewhere else?

213
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:01,268
Oh, Mr. Floyd. Are you gracing
us with your presence today?

214
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,639
Uh, might as well.

215
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:07,942
You know, Ginny, I was thinking maybe you
and I can get together over the summer.

216
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:11,347
It'll be legal. We could make things
happen. I'll keep it mum's the word.

217
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,420
I promise. I swear to you.

218
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,324
At the party tonight, I heard there's
gonna be a girl with knockers this big.

219
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,362
- Bullshit. - Promise. Two
handfuls. - Shut up, Carl.

220
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,364
- No way.
- Yes.

221
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,663
- Uh-uh. -
Hey. Psst. Hey.

222
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:31,169
Pentico got his brother's car. Let's go.

223
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,172
- Cool, man.
- Cool.

224
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:36,038
- Go talk to him.
- I'm not going alone.

225
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,668
Come on. Come on. Ask him.

226
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,714
Uh, Mr. Payne, sir...

227
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,216
you know, every second that
you could let us out early...

228
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,015
would really increase
our chances of survival.

229
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,892
It's like our sergeant told us
before one trip into the jungle.

230
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,028
"Men!

231
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,226
Fifty of you are leaving on a mission.
Twenty-five of ya ain't comin' back. "

232
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,938
Okay.

233
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,968
You know, the '68
Democratic Convention...

234
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,567
was probably the most
bitchin'time I ever had in my life.

235
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,910
Hey, guys. One more
thing. Hey. This summer...

236
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:19,042
when you're being inundated with all this
American bicentennial Fourth ofJuly brouhaha...

237
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:21,451
don't forget what you're
celebrating, and that's the fact...

238
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:24,183
that a bunch of slave-owning
aristocratic white males...

239
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,225
didn't want to pay their taxes.

240
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,352
- Yeah!
- Have a good summer.

241
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:29,255
Hey. Over there. Let's get 'em.

242
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,564
Hey! No cutting.

243
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,878
Hey. Hey, hey.

244
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:59,441
Hey!

245
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:01,453
- Run, man!

246
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:06,549
Jump in. Come on. We gotta go.

247
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

248
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,222
- Whoo!
- Hurry up, Hirshfelder. We're gonna leave your ass.

249
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,231
- Sorry, man.
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.

250
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,325
- Whoa. Back it up. Back it up.
- Oh, shit!

251
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:19,429
- Whoo-ee! Ducks on the
pond. - How you doin', boys?

252
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,701
Whoo!

253
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,709
Wake up, bitch. Wake up.

254
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:33,082
Open. Open. Hey, hey. Open.

255
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,458
Okay. Open wide.

256
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,529
Open wide.

257
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,590
- Open. Yeah.
- What do you think?

258
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,100
All right. We got 'em.

259
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,364
Hey, you. Come here.

260
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,642
You.

261
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,870
- Who are you?
- Uh, nobody.

262
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,539
I mean, I wasn't in the truck.

263
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,116
- Are you a freshman?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,686
Well, are you in, or are you out?

265
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,982
- In.
- Let's go.

266
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,726
Come on! Let's go!

267
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,853
Go! Come on! Hurry up!

268
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:18,761
Oh, man. We're screwed!

269
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,391
- Pentico, lose them.
- I'm tryin', man!

270
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,993
Whoo!

271
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,369
- Let's go! Come on!
- Who you fuckin' with?

272
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,671
- Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!
- Drive! Drive this piece of shit!

273
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,836
Shut up, man. Here they come.

274
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,749
Fucking turn!

275
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,252
Oh, shit!

276
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,861
- Come on! Let's go! Whoo!

277
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,432
Oh, shit! Here they come!

278
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,799
I think we really pissed them off,
man. Just drop me off at my house.

279
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:59,236
- Are you still with me?
- Yeah. I guess.

280
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,603
- This is my house.
- They're slowing down.

281
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,700
You get out and get 'em. You get out.

282
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,109
- Good luck, man. Be there tonight.
- All right.

283
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,447
All right. I'll catch up with
you guys later. Go, go, go.

284
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,786
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, nice try, freshmen.

285
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,452
Tell you what. Just for being
such brave little kids...

286
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,928
I'm only gonna give each
of ya five licks, okay?

287
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,489
All right. Grab a pole
then, kids. Let's get goin'.

288
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,126
I don't think so, creep.

289
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:32,228
Mom!

290
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,467
Carl, get in the
house. Get in the house!

291
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:40,335
And you ?Get the hell off my property.

292
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:45,009
Oh. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. I was just
escorting your fine young son home from school.

293
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:48,019
There's?There were some
ruffians about, and I?

294
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,988
Oh, and, uh, Mitch, Carl.

295
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,992
We'll be seeing each other again.

296
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:02,368
Oh, that's it. I fuckin'saw that, you
little sack of shit. You two are fuckin'dead!

297
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,495
You hear me? You're fuckin' dead!

298
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:08,197
Excuse me. Thank you.

299
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,272
All right, you little freshman bitches.

300
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:18,180
Air raid!

301
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,116
That was pathetic!

302
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,120
You guys are crumbs!

303
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,124
Let's try it again! That means get
up, you lazy little bitches. Get up!

304
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,126
You heard her!

305
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,322
Air raid!

306
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:35,527
That was horrible, you little slut
girls. You little freshman sluts. Get up!

307
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:39,367
Get up! Up! Up! Up!

308
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,237
Air raid!

309
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,310
What's fascinating is the
way not only the school...

310
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,471
but the entire community seems to be
supporting this ?or at least turn their heads.

311
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,879
- They apparently have permission to use the parking lot.
- Right.

312
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:52,451
No parents seem to mind. You
know. They're selling concessions.

313
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,019
- I mean ?
- I know.

314
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:57,522
The seniors, we tried. We
We gave you all a chance.

315
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:02,652
But since you little prick-teases
can't follow instructions...

316
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,732
we're just gonna have to
try something else, won't we?

317
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,993
Seniors ?

318
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,831
You love us. Smile. You love us.

319
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:20,570
Turn over.

320
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,550
Suffer, sisters!

321
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,744
Suffer!

322
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,753
Whoo!

323
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:37,122
Eat it! Open wide!

324
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,098
- Open wide! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
- # Why can't we be friends #

325
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,431
Yes! Whoo!

326
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,869
Love it, girls. Love it!

327
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,532
Gorgeous babies.

328
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,137
Welcome to high school, honey.

329
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,737
- You love it, honey.
- You little bitch!

330
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:00,252
#I remember you when you drank my wine #

331
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,719
- # Why can't we be friends #
- Go!

332
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:05,848
Propose to Mr. Dawson.

333
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,893
You idiot.

334
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:11,489
- Will you marry me?
- Don't know. What's in it for me?

335
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,089
- Suck on it harder.
- Anything you want.

336
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,101
- Anything?
- Anything.

337
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,228
Go like this.

338
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,399
- Do you spit or swallow?
- Oh ?

339
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,171
Whatever you I-like.

340
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:27,576
Whatever I like? I would
definitely marry you.

341
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,581
- That is so degrading.
- Let's go.

342
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,676
- You're an asshole.
- Yes, I am.

343
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:36,756
That's terrible, man. It's horrible.

344
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:39,451
Aha!

345
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,027
I just want you guys to
know I feel for you, man.

346
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:45,326
I did it when I was a freshman, and
you'll do it when you're a senior.

347
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:49,129
But you're doing great. Now fry like
bacon, you little freshman piggies!

348
00:22:49,236 --> 00:22:51,466
Fry! Fry!

349
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,562
- Hi.
- Hi.

350
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:57,507
- Hello there.
- I would like for you to propose to Tony.

351
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,442
Oh, God.

352
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,514
On your knees.

353
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,184
Will you marry me?

354
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,553
- What am I supposed to say here?
- I ?I don't know.

355
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,058
Um, what'll you do for me, huh?

356
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,288
Um, anything you want.

357
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,365
- Imagine the possibilities.
- Oh, Jesus.

358
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,366
No, seriously, you can stand up.

359
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,527
- Um, what's your name?
- Sabrina.

360
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:25,036
- I'm Tony.
- Hi.

361
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,800
- Anthony actually.
- Sorry.

362
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,808
- This is Mike.
- Hey.

363
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,004
We were just discussing the utter
stupidity of these initiation rituals...

364
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,809
and we were we're kind of
wondering why someone like you...

365
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,248
would subject yourself to
the losing end of it all.

366
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,319
What are we having?
Social hour over here?

367
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,184
I'm supposed to be being
a bitch. Back to the pit.

368
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,053
All right, kiddo.

369
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,991
- It's almost over. Don't worry about it.
- So, uh, am I mistaken...

370
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,892
or was there a little unspoken
thing going on with that young vixen?

371
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,897
- You stud.
- You know how it is.

372
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,196
- I bet she's pretty cute once you clean all the shit off her.
- I bet she is.

373
00:23:56,303 --> 00:24:00,933
Okay, girlies! It's hot out here, and
I'm really sick of looking at all of you.

374
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,407
So let's just ?Let's get out of here.

375
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,469
What are you looking at? Wipe
that face off your head, bitch.

376
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,947
Let's go! Get in the truck!

377
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,018
Get in the truck! Come on!

378
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,382
You know, maybe if you
ever left the poker table ?

379
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,682
Maybe if I ever left the
poker table? What about you?

380
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,953
Whatever. I mean, the point is, that's
why we're going out tonight. You know?

381
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,121
Who knows? You might experience something a
little more tangible than an Abraham Lincoln dream.

382
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:27,190
- That's, like, a hairline fracture right there.
- Shit.

383
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,564
- What's that about? What'd you do?
- I wouldn't doubt it.

384
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,830
My boy Benny was wearing
their asses out, boy!

385
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:36,068
- Shit.
- I just gave him a little beating he'll never forget.

386
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:38,144
Here's to ya, Ma.

387
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,374
That's your fucking mother.

388
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,780
Say, man. Fuck the coaches,
man. Just do it for us, man.

389
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,853
- You picked this thing up?
- Yeah. You know.

390
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,012
Hey. What are you doin'?

391
00:24:49,122 --> 00:24:51,022
- He ain't doin' shit now.
- What?

392
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:54,719
Got any more details of my life you got
figured out you can let me in on, Ben?

393
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,296
Lots of details.

394
00:24:57,397 --> 00:25:00,298
- Hey, O'Bannion, what are you doing?
- What's happening?

395
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,368
Oh, you didn't hear, did you?

396
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,733
- What?
- Didn't hear I got a shotgun pulled on my ass?

397
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,738
- No way!
- Swear to God.

398
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,740
# Seniors are the best #

399
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,776
# Seniors, seniors #

400
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,777
S- E- N-I-O-R-S ##

401
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,909
Oh, my God!

402
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:20,244
# Seniors, seniors #

403
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,514
#They are the best #

404
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:36,002
Ow. Freezing!

405
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:39,369
Hey, Mrs. Pickford.

406
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,667
Hi, guys. You here to see Kevin?

407
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:44,005
- No. Actually, we came here to see you.
- Oh.

408
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,511
- Bet you're glad school's out, aren't you?
- Yeah. We got our report cards today.

409
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:49,946
- How did you do?
- Straight A's.

410
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,143
- Both of you?
- Yeah.

411
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:54,516
- Big trip, huh?
- We're going away for the weekend.

412
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:57,351
- Oh, you're taking Kev with ya, huh?
- No. He's staying here.

413
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:59,357
Oh. Oh, he is. Oh.

414
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:02,053
- Thanks.
- Go on in. He's up there somewhere.

415
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:12,004
- Let's get together sometime. All right?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

416
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:14,005
- All right.
- Be lots of fun.

417
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,098
- Yeah.
- What do you do? I mean, for fun.

418
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:19,804
Usually just hang out with the girls. You
know, drive around. That kind of stuff.

419
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,313
There's a big party tonight.
It should be really great.

420
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,383
- Oh.
- So ?

421
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,318
- Do you want to come?
- Yeah.

422
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

423
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,322
- Cool. Think it'll be all right?
- It'll be fine.

424
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,619
- Great. We'll pick you up at about 8:30.
- Okay. Cool.

425
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,627
- See you then.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

426
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,754
Bye.

427
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,458
All right. Let's go. We gotta get ready.

428
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,911
Sample of the goods.

429
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,948
Fifteen bucks.

430
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,519
Can you spot me 10?

431
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,215
I'll pay you, like, Tuesday and shit.

432
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,695
Thank you.

433
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,924
"Shebanga. " Who is it?

434
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:16,594
- Kevin, I think you need to come out here a minute.
- Hide the shit.

435
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,467
- Oh, man. It reeks in here.
- Shit.

436
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,767
Slater, get up.

437
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:25,402
Kevin, there's someone out here
who says he needs to talk to you.

438
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:27,412
Here. What about?

439
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:30,039
Go get the door man. Here.

440
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,311
- Slater, lose it.
- Kevin, open the door.

441
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,785
- Quick!
- Lose it, man. Damn.

442
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,388
Hey, Dad, Ma. What's up?

443
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,256
- Did you order some kegs of beer?
- No.

444
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,627
Well, there's a fella in a beer truck
out on the street that says you did.

445
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,461
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

446
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,967
Just a sec.

447
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,974
Shit.

448
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,168
- That guy said I ordered a keg of beer?
- Yeah.

449
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,044
He said it was to be delivered
to the Pickford residence.

450
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,208
- This address?
- This address.

451
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:09,118
That's kind of funny. Why don't I
go out there and see what's goin' on?

452
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:11,190
Yeah. I think you better.

453
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,759
I'll be right back.

454
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,953
You guys know anything
about a party here tonight?

455
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,528
- No, sir.
- No.

456
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,665
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

457
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,867
Hey, man.

458
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,035
- Aren't you a little bit early?
- Uh ?

459
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,979
Yeah. About an hour and a half.

460
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,549
But, see, I wanted to get here
early, see if anyone's here.

461
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:43,020
- I got this little action happening tonight, man, if you know what I mean.
- So I guess you got the wrong house.

462
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,624
Oh.

463
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:51,186
Yeah. Inconvenience for you. I'm sorry.
Uh, wrong Mr. Pickford all together.

464
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,891
Hey. These things happen.
Don't worry about it, Ben.

465
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,968
Yeah.

466
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,137
Were you going to have a
party here tonight, Son?

467
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,573
I don't know what that was all about.

468
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,839
Start unpacking. We're
not goin' anywhere.

469
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,039
Frank?

470
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,117
- Fucker!
- Frank?

471
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,329
Oh, look out! Look out! Look out! Aaah!

472
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:12,961
Hey, batter, batter, batter, swing!

473
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,169
Strike two!

474
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,180
Time.

475
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:27,209
Kramer, one more pitch. You better get this
kid out or we're really gonna beat your ass.

476
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,689
We're gonna beat you
like a running mule.

477
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:36,160
Hey, man. Forget about those guys.
Let's just get this last guy out, okay?

478
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,162
Easy for your ass to say.

479
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,324
- Hey, man. There's nothing you can do about it.
- I'll beat you too.

480
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:43,766
- How'd they all know I was gonna be here?
- Hey, Kramer!

481
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,929
Quit stallin'! Let's go,
baby! We're waiting for you!

482
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,701
I hope you got more than a jockstrap
under there, you little rat!

483
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:53,006
Just because you're not gonna be able to sit down for the
rest of the summer, don't let it affect your concentration.

484
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,012
- Up yours.
- Hey, Mitch.

485
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,572
Could you do the rest of us a favor and
leave through the gate in right field?

486
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:00,585
That'll draw them all out of here.

487
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,746
I mean, they're gonna get you anyway.

488
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,358
Yeah. Get out of here.

489
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:10,395
- Who are you, buddy?
- What are you looking at? Keep your head in the game. Concentrate!

490
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:31,174
Strike three! Ball game!

491
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:51,398
Good game. Good game. Good
game. Good game. Good game.

492
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:55,565
- Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. Right.
- Good game. Good game.

493
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,100
Yeah, right. Good game.
Good game, man. Good game.

494
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,738
Oh, yeah. Good game. Good game.

495
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:06,341
Way to go, buddy. Way to go.

496
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,420
Way to go.

497
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,546
Come here, man!

498
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,556
Mitchy.

499
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:16,958
- Oh, what happened to your buds?
- Aw, you're all alone.

500
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:19,327
- Hey, Mi ?Oh.
- Oh.

501
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:22,924
- Hey, Mitch. Mitch! Hey!
- Kramer.

502
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:27,638
- How's your dad doing?
- Uh, he's doing great.

503
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,774
This arm ready to throw
about 2,000 yards next fall?

504
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:35,109
Oh. I don't know. We'll see.

505
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:37,774
We're depending on you boys.

506
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:41,012
And let me tell you
what. You're looking good.

507
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,180
Thirteen starters coming
back. Twenty-two lettermen.

508
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,851
- Lookin' tough.
- Yeah.

509
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,260
- Well, uh, you folks take care.
- Okay. Good to see you, Randy.

510
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,339
Whoa!

511
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:11,467
Oh, God! You know that hurt!
You know that hurt him, man.

512
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:14,307
- What's goin' on here?
- Oh, Pink, man. You missed it. Whoo!

513
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,677
- What's up, buddy?
- Where you guys headed off to now?

514
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:20,081
- We're going up to the Emporium. Gonna join us?
- Yeah. See you up there.

515
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,688
You should sign my paddle later.

516
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,882
- I gotta get seconds with him.
- Wait, wait, wait.

517
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:28,085
- This is just too slick.
- You next, Pink?

518
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:31,493
- Sure.
- All right. Say, you already got the kid.

519
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:35,431
All right. Fuck it. You know what? I'm gonna
go find your little skinny partner Carl...

520
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:38,595
and his mom, and let me tell you
something, I took it easy on you.

521
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:42,265
All right? Yeah. You're not smiling
now, are you? You little sack of shit.

522
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,309
Huh? Huh?

523
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,471
- Benny, Don.
- Say, man.

524
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,174
- Bummer about Pickford's party, huh?
- Yeah.

525
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:55,050
Yeah. His old man found
out. Total rip-off, man.

526
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,125
Hey, man. You know, us ?We
got a few sixers. You with us?

527
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,256
Uh, yeah. I gotta go home and
change. I'll catch up with you, okay?

528
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,233
All right. See you later. Hey,
kid. Take care of that butt.

529
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,463
- Say, guys. Hold up.

530
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,337
You need a ride?

531
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:22,573
Yeah. Uh...

532
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,980
I think they left me.

533
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:29,421
Here you go, man.

534
00:36:45,137 --> 00:36:48,402
Yeah, there's always one
senior who has to be the badass.

535
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:54,942
I think O'Bannion's gonna be the first senior
in history to take that honor two years in a row.

536
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,811
Guy's a dick. Right?

537
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:02,485
Yeah. He's, uh, kind of a joke.

538
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:05,853
He's not a bad guy to have on
your side, though, blocking for ya.

539
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,620
Yeah.

540
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:11,390
Did you get it bad when
you were a freshman?

541
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:14,091
Shit, man. Aw.

542
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,601
They waited for my ass after
baseball practice and got me.

543
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:20,536
God, it was vicious.

544
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,438
I mean, actually, it is best to
get a lot at once, you know...

545
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:27,740
'cause after about 10 licks, your ass gets
so numb, you might as well get it over with.

546
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:32,077
I had some pretty cool
seniors though, you know.

547
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:35,153
They'd take you out and bust
the hell out of you and then...

548
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,154
go get you drunk.

549
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,157
- You know, stuff like that.
- Cool.

550
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:48,296
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Take care, man.

551
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:55,098
Uh, hey, man. Uh, look. Since
the party's not goin' on...

552
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:59,541
me and some of the other guys will
probably end upjust riding around.

553
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:02,170
You want us to stop by and pick you up?

554
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,717
- Well, do you think that's a good idea?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, man. No problem.

555
00:38:05,818 --> 00:38:10,221
Even after you've gotten it bad, the guys who
haven't got you yet will give you a few days to rest.

556
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:14,782
It, uh ?It'd be a pretty cool move to show up
and let 'em know it doesn't bother you that much.

557
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:17,260
Yeah, okay. Cool.

558
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,854
- See you later?
- Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the ride, man.

559
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,698
Hey, man. Uh, put some
ice on it for a while.

560
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,533
After that it won't be anything
a few beers can't take care of.

561
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,152
Like, what did she say?
I'm just interested.

562
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:16,346
I think it's funny.
What did she call me?

563
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:20,118
You hang out with her. You know it. We
know they talk about us. Just tell us.

564
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,126
- Nothing.
- We don't care.

565
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:26,289
Oh, come on. Nothing. That's a lie when
you do that. I know you're lying, you bitch.

566
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,389
- I know you're lying.
- You're not gonna get mad?

567
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:31,595
I'm not gonna get mad. I think it's
a riot. I don't care what she thinks.

568
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:34,571
All right. She called you
a bitch and you a slut.

569
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,870
A slut? She called me a
slut? That bitch. I can't ?

570
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:40,104
- Everybody calls you a slut.
- Shavonne!

571
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,908
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, that bitch. I'm gonna kick her ass.

572
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:45,006
I can't believe that. What a bitch.

573
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,950
- I thought you said you weren't gonna get mad.
- I'm not mad.

574
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,594
- Look. I got a confession to make.
- What do you mean a confession?

575
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,757
For the, like, last year or so I've
been talking about going to law school...

576
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:05,735
so I can be an A.C.L.U. Lawyer and be in a
position to help people who are getting fucked over.

577
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,035
- Uh-huh. - Well, I was standing in line
at the post office yesterday, you know.

578
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,735
And I'm looking around. And
everybody's looking really pathetic.

579
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,280
You know what I mean? I mean, like,
people had ?like, got drool just sort of?

580
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:17,975
Then this guy's bending over.
You could see the crack of his ?

581
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,711
It was, like, wife beaters.
It was Anyway, it was ?

582
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,948
And I realized I just don't want
to do it. You know what I mean?

583
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:28,550
It sounds good, but I have to confront the fact that I
don't like the people I've been talking about helping out.

584
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:31,789
You know what I'm ?I don't think I
like people, period. You guys are okay.

585
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,990
I'm just trying to be honest
about being a misanthrope.

586
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,067
So you're not gonna go to law school?

587
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:38,898
What do you want to do then?

588
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,904
I want to dance.

589
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,445
All right. Let's rock and roll.

590
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,317
Hey. Hop in, man.

591
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,547
Hey, man. Whose car?

592
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,850
- You know Wooderson?
- How's it goin', man?

593
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:02,086
Hey. Pretty good.
How's it goin' with you?

594
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:07,459
Say, man. You got a joint?

595
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,625
Uh, no. Not on me, man.

596
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,265
It'd be a lot cooler if you did.

597
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:25,243
All right, all right, all right.

598
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:29,253
Hey, man. You still driving in to Houston in
the morning to get those Aerosmith tickets?

599
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:31,255
Ooh, you're damn right.

600
00:41:31,357 --> 00:41:33,848
- Evenin', ladies. Ow!
- Nice.

601
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,723
- Need me to pick you up a couple?
- Yeah. Two.

602
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,729
Cool.

603
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,360
- Hey, man. You sure I'm okay in here?
- Yeah, man. You'll be okay.

604
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,199
Look. If anyone starts messing
with you, just play it cool.

605
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,163
- One to go.

606
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:23,173
"Prickford. "

607
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:24,708
"Wood-a-been.
"Happening?

608
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,869
It's a bummer about your party, man.

609
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:30,346
What can I say? It's beyond
me. The delivery guy bricked.

610
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:32,713
And it's a ?Keep your eye on the ball ?

611
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:34,115
dead issue!

612
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,153
- Hey, man. How's it going?
- Good. What's goin' on?

613
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,347
- Nothin'.
- Not much?

614
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,855
- Nothing at all.
- Hey.

615
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,188
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, you know Mitch?

616
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,319
- Oh, yeah. I think I just heard about you.
- Really? What'd you hear?

617
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,866
- I don't know, man. Are you okay?
- Oh. Yeah.

618
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:52,136
Oh. I guess I'll see
you guys a little later.

619
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,865
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Okay. See you.

620
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:06,913
Hey, man. What grade's she in?

621
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,044
Sophomore.

622
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,054
- Come on. Come on.
- All right.

623
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,784
Hurry up. Go. We gotta hurry though.

624
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:17,020
- Check this out. Double-barreled
purple coming in on Sunday. - Donny.

625
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:20,098
- I got a big surprise for you.
- After I make this shot.

626
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:23,691
Oh, God. Hold onto this.
Tight. Lookin' good.

627
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:28,038
Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,938
Whoa! Gene!

629
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:32,943
Nice tongue!

630
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,036
- Who painted 'em?
- Mostly Michelle.

631
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:37,672
Ah!

632
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,842
- Hey. I got an idea.
- What?

633
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:42,420
- A beer bust later on.
- Hey, man.

634
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:45,354
Pickford's got a doob we're
about to burn. Are you with us?

635
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,925
Think about it. Yeah.

636
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:49,961
Are you cool, man?

637
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,530
Like how?

638
00:43:56,435 --> 00:43:58,596
Okay.

639
00:43:58,704 --> 00:44:01,366
Hey, man. Wait up.

640
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,668
He was just asking if you get high.

641
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:06,142
- Yeah. Like, smoke pot?
- Yeah.

642
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:08,941
Oh. I never have before, but, you know.

643
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:20,248
- Where you goin'? Mike. Mike.

645
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:24,329
Just ?

646
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,064
I ?No.

647
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:33,297
Crank it up!

648
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,910
Look out!

649
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:42,913

650
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:46,542
- Hi there.

651
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:48,882
- Great.

652
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:54,482
- Here you go.

653
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,962
Hey. It's the chicks. Shavonne
still thinks she's mad at me.

654
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:04,297
Watch me get a little something going
right here. Hey. What's going on?

655
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:07,133
- What are you guys up to?
- Oh, a little weed. You know.

656
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:10,003
- There may be a beer bust later on.
- Oh, really?

657
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:12,009
- Yeah.
- Cool.

658
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:14,807
- Guess we'll see you around.
- All right. Check you later.

659
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:16,278
- Bye.
- Later.

660
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,282
Slater, man, why are you
always such a dork, man?

661
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:22,478
- What are you talkin' about?
- "Check you later. " "Check you later. "

662
00:45:22,588 --> 00:45:24,556
Hey, man. Get off my case, man.

663
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:27,523
Oh, man. Chicks don't
want to hear that shit.

664
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:29,617
Well, they don't want
to hear anything, man.

665
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:33,494
The g The girls, man, in our
classes ?They're all prudes, man.

666
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,726
- They're worthless little bitches, man.
- Oh, my God ?

667
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:38,962
It's the girls ahead of us. They were
wild. Our class is just worthless.

668
00:45:39,071 --> 00:45:42,973
Maybe you've just never gotten past the sniffing
butt stage. That's what that sounds like to me.

669
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:46,272
Hey, man. It's ?It's quality,
not quantity. All right, man?

670
00:45:46,378 --> 00:45:50,178
And And wait till I get to college,
man. I can't wait to get to college, man.

671
00:45:50,282 --> 00:45:53,308
Yeah. When I get to college, all I'm
gonna do is bang, bang, bang, bang.

672
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,401
Hey, Hirshfelder. Let's go. Come on.

673
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:23,538
Yeah. Let's go. Let's get out of here.

674
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:25,776
- Let's go.
- Come on, man!

675
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,580
- What?
- It's time to leave.

676
00:46:28,687 --> 00:46:31,053
I'll be right back.

677
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:43,224
Hey. You boys leave,
you can't come back.

678
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:45,895
Aw, gee. You hear that?

679
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,097
If we leave, we can't come back.

680
00:46:48,207 --> 00:46:50,107
Oh, no!

681
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:52,234
What should we do?

682
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:57,509
What the hell are we
doing? I was gettin' there.

683
00:46:57,616 --> 00:46:59,516
Man, I had my hand up her shirt.

684
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:02,348
- Oh, yeah.
- You were gettin' there?

685
00:47:02,454 --> 00:47:04,615
You hear that? He was gettin' there.

686
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:10,094
Son, you wouldn't know what to do with it even
if you had gotten there. So don't worry about it.

687
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,629
- Just 'cause you guys are striking out.
- Grow up, boy.

688
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:15,097
- That was our last junior high party.
- That's right.

689
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,000
We're in the big time now. We're freshmen,
where all the girls will be putting out.

690
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:22,005
Your days of lying around and
pulling tongue all night are over.

691
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:24,007
Yeah, right.

692
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,753
- You didn't know she stuffs her bra?
- Terry stuffs her bra?

693
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:46,626
- You didn't know those were socks? Shit.
- Yeah.

694
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,700
They looked real to me.

695
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:55,038
- Oh, shit.
- Scatter!

696
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:03,113
This one right here! Come
here, baby! We got you, baby!

697
00:48:03,215 --> 00:48:05,149
Whoo!

698
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,309
All right. Get out there. Go, baby. Go.

699
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:11,954
Come here. Come here,
you little fag. Come here.

700
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,957
- Come on.

701
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,256
Get over here. Where
you running to, boy, huh?

702
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,489
We ain't gonna hurt you ?much.

703
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,625
Just hold onto that fence there, all
right, and just squeal like a pig.

704
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:27,805
- You ready to
switch-hit? - Oh, yeah.

705
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,636
I'm first.

706
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:40,214
Geez. Bastards.

707
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,150
Hey, you guys.

708
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,330
Take it easy on the kid, would you?

709
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:54,661
Here comes another one,
freshman. You ready?

710
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,666
- Ladies.
- You like that?

711
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,703
One more for my mother.

712
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:03,532
Hey. Who is that kid?

713
00:49:03,642 --> 00:49:07,908
What? That kid there? Just some kid we saw running
around that shouldn't have been, by the rec center.

714
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:10,243
Hey. Can we have some of those beers?

715
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:13,182
- One of these?
- Yeah.

716
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:15,753
- Why?
- Just give me a beer.

717
00:49:15,854 --> 00:49:18,118
- Get out ofhere, I said!
- Yeah?

718
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:20,123
Catch. Huh? Hmm?

719
00:49:20,225 --> 00:49:23,126
Tubbs, catch. Good. Get out ofhere.

720
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:26,026
- What are you wasting a beer on him for?
- What?

721
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:29,693
- It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal.
- Give 'em a beer.

722
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,769
Man, this fuckin' sucks. All right?

723
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,169
Last fuckin' day of school.
No fuckin' party. No fuckin' ?

724
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,470
- You just wasted another fuckin' beer.
- Oh, shut up.

725
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:41,478
Thanks.

726
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,912
- Hmm.
- Hey.

727
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:49,650
So, which one of your friends
bought you the beer this time?

728
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:51,655
- Right.
- Hey! Fuck her! I did!

729
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:54,885
- Yeah, bite me!
- You wish, asshole!

730
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,893
Fuck you!

731
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,725
Why are guys such pigs?

732
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,731
- What?
- Let's get out of here.

733
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,393
Mmm. We're out of here.

734
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:07,472
Let me tell you what Melba
Toast is packin'right here.

735
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,668
We got 411 positrack out back, 750
double pumper, Edelbrock intakes...

736
00:50:11,777 --> 00:50:16,680
Ford over-30, 11-to-1 pop-up
pistons, Turbo-jet 390 horsepower.

737
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,977
We're talkin' some fuckin' muscle.

738
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:21,848
Hey, man, I know you got this
thing out of a comic book.

739
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:24,854
I saw the ad ?2.95. It was
right next to the sea monkeys.

740
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:26,856
You see that over there?
That's white lightning.

741
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:29,984
You see the shoes on that thing? You gotta
get some tires. These are pizza cutters.

742
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:34,588
Yeah.

743
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,031
- Ow.
- You're such an expert.

744
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:39,831
This is sad. Shouldn't we
be doing something else?

745
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:41,838
Yeah. Like what?

746
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,840
- I'm bored.
- You're always bored.

747
00:50:43,942 --> 00:50:45,671
- Let's split.
- Where you wanna go?

748
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:47,301
Then you're boring.

749
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:49,312
- Pink!
- Hey.

750
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,905
Hey. You hear anything
more about a beer bust?

751
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:55,612
- Talk to this man right here.
- Patience, darlin', patience.

752
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,620
- Hey.
- Hey.

753
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:02,182
- What are you doing here?
- I was just about to ask you the same question.

754
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:04,455
- I heard you got busted.
- Oh, yeah.

755
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,463
They just got Hirshfelder too.

756
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,055
- Really?
- Yeah.

757
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,134
- Like, how bad?
- Bad.

758
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,870
- Was it O'Bannion?
- Yeah.

759
00:51:13,972 --> 00:51:16,372
God, I hate that jerk.

760
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:18,534
I know.

761
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:21,203
So, um ?

762
00:51:21,313 --> 00:51:23,508
What have you guys been doin'? Just ?

763
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:26,709
I don't know. Driving around, mostly.

764
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:29,048
I didn't know thatJodi
was your big sister.

765
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:31,554
- Oop.
- Hey, did I hear my name over here?

766
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:34,420
You guys talkin' about me? Hey, kiddo.

767
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,085
Heard they got you pretty bad.

768
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:41,825
And I asked them to take it easy on
you. I can't believe they did that.

769
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,401
Man! God! No wonder!

770
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:49,065
Pink, what happened?

771
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:51,074
So, where'd they find Hirsh?

772
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:54,077
I don't know. Walking out
of the rec center, I think.

773
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,079
- Hey.

774
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,673
- What have you guys been doin'?
- Pink, right?

775
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,086
Hi!

776
00:52:03,188 --> 00:52:05,088
Ohh!

777
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,158
Hi.

778
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,296
Whew.

779
00:52:12,397 --> 00:52:15,833
Face it. You got busted
because you couldn't get away.

780
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:17,902
You try and outrun
O'Bannion and those guys.

781
00:52:18,003 --> 00:52:21,564
I'm gonna be laughin' my ass off when it's
your turn, when they're busting your ass.

782
00:52:21,673 --> 00:52:24,005
Hey, man, I heard last year...

783
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:26,270
they caught about 10 freshmen at once.

784
00:52:26,378 --> 00:52:29,279
O'Bannion backed his truck over
some pizzas and made 'em eat it, man.

785
00:52:29,381 --> 00:52:31,281
I mean, that's bullshit. Right?

786
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:34,284
Idiot flunks his senior year so he
can be a dick two years in a row?

787
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:36,286
Is that legal?

788
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:38,356
Damn you, Carl!

789
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:47,297
Ohh! Okay. Let me out.

790
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:50,732
Hey, Slater, you fuckin'
hippie! Give me drugs, man!

791
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,303
Get some from your mother, man.

792
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:56,306
- Yeah, we just banged your mother.
- Okay. Fuck you, dickhead.

793
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,813
Those guys, man. Man of the woods. What's
goin' on? God, I haven't seen you in so long.

794
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:04,814
My man, what is happenin'?

795
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,282
Long time no see.

796
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,320
- What have you been up to?
- Same old shit, man.

797
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:12,754
- Workin' for the city.
- Workin' man, huh?

798
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,690
Been thinkin' about gettin'
back in school though, man.

799
00:53:15,794 --> 00:53:18,126
- Back in J.C., somethin' like that?
- Yeah, man.

800
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:21,630
I mean, that's where
all the girls are, right?

801
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,634
But on the other hand, man,
I'd just as soon keep workin'.

802
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:27,637
- Keep a little change in my pocket.
- Yeah? Wait.

803
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:31,641
Rather than spend my time listenin' to some dipshit
who doesn't know what he's talkin' about anyway.

804
00:53:31,743 --> 00:53:33,711
I know what you're talkin' about.

805
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,880
- Say, you're a freshman, right?
- Yeah.

806
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:40,884
All right, so tell me, man. How's this
year's crop of freshman chicks lookin'?

807
00:53:42,988 --> 00:53:46,389
Wood, you're gonna end up in jail sometime
really soon. I know that for a fact.

808
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:48,891
No, man. No, let me tell you.

809
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:53,260
That's what I love about
these high school girls, man.

810
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:56,163
I get older, they stay the same age.

811
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:58,167
Yes, they do.

812
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,169
Yes, they do.

813
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,638
- You guys wanna go for a spin?
- Shotgun!

814
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:05,710
Aw.

815
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:08,574
- Woods.
- I'm here, man.

816
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,580
You wanna come along?

817
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:12,582
Yeah. Why not?

818
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:15,812
- Take care, bro.
- You boys have fun now.

819
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,650
Listen, I'm gonna give you shotgun.

820
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:22,454
But I want you to know it's because
?only 'cause I'm goin' inside.

821
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,859
- Keep that in mind. All right?
- Okay. Got it.

822
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:32,059
- Hey, man, whose bowling ball is this?
- It's yours, man.

823
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,570
- Slater.
- Hey, man. What's happening?

824
00:54:34,673 --> 00:54:36,800
- Play a little foosball?
- Yeah!

825
00:54:57,195 --> 00:54:59,026
Junior.

826
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:05,727
Pull over to the trash can.

827
00:55:05,837 --> 00:55:08,738
Pull over to the trash can!
Pull over to the trash can!

828
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,364
Lemme, lemme, lemme, lemme ?

829
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:22,885
Okay. Okay. Oh!

830
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,716
Shit, yeah!

831
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:31,259
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

832
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:33,489
Hey, you guys, pull over
to that one over there.

833
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:35,657
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Here, hold this. Hold this.

834
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:43,301
- I got it! Go! Go!
- Guess what.

835
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:45,808
It's garbage day!

836
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:49,609
Yeah!

837
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:52,683
We're fuckin'runnin'!

838
00:55:53,952 --> 00:55:56,250
Yeah! Whoo!

839
00:55:56,354 --> 00:56:00,188
- Whoo!
- Oh, my?

840
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:03,192
Bowling ball.

841
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:05,262
- Yeah!
- Throw the bowling ball.

842
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:07,331
Think I should?

843
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:09,696
- Yeah! Throw it!
- Throw it! Throw it!

844
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:12,326
Come on. You're playin'with
the big boys now.

845
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:15,634
Do it! Throw it! Faggot-sissy-pussy
freshman! Throw it!

846
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,605
- Throw it!
- Heave it!

847
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:25,582
Fuck 'em!

848
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:30,347
That bowling ball said "Oof!"
To that damn windshield!

849
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:33,481
- Yeah! - Ha-ha!
You're nuts, junior!

850
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,491
You're nuts!

851
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,493
Hey, man, we're out ofbeer.

852
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,621
- We gotta make a Grab-'N'-
Go stop. - Fuck that.

853
00:56:40,732 --> 00:56:43,257
- I don't have any money. Who's got money?
- I gave mine to him.

854
00:56:43,368 --> 00:56:45,268
Where's your money? Nah, doesn't matter.

855
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,531
Pull in heading out that way.

856
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,070
- What are you gonna do, man? Hoist it?
- Yeah. That all I ever do.

857
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,581
- I just need the freshman as a lookout.
- I don't wanna get in trouble. Do you, Randall Pink?

858
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:01,151
- I don't know about this, Don.
- Come on.

859
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,389
I don't wanna see you.

860
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,755
Better be careful, junior.

861
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,456
- Sunflower seeds.
- Zigzags!

862
00:57:12,564 --> 00:57:15,533
- Zigzags.
- Hey, man, I'm not too sure about this.

863
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:18,966
Shh. I'm really gonna pay for it. I'm
just messin' around with them. Okay?

864
00:57:20,071 --> 00:57:22,039
Good.

865
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:39,822
Run! Go, go, go, go, go!

866
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:43,553
Come on, guys! We gotta get

867
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,891
- Let's go!
- Oh, my God!

868
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:48,966
All right, now don't try anything,
or I'll shoot the shit out of ya.

869
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:52,867
- Don, give the beer back, man.
- I paid for the beer, man.

870
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,402
Busted my mailbox, didn't you?

871
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,475
Look me in the eye, punk!

872
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:02,068
I don't know what you're talking
about, sir, but I suggest that you ?

873
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,943
You busted it, didn't ya?

874
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:11,322
Tamperin' with mailboxes
is a felony offense.

875
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:15,820
- I done called the police.

876
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:18,623
I think you boys oughta
get out of the car.

877
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,722
- Just go, man.
- Nice and slow.

878
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,758
Go, go, go!

879
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,969
Whoo!

880
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:31,602
Get down!

881
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:33,973
He's shooting at us! Holy?

882
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,643
Fairly uneventful, huh?

883
00:58:42,587 --> 00:58:44,487
Which one of you had the theory...

884
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:47,490
about how President Ford's
old football head injuries...

885
00:58:47,592 --> 00:58:49,492
is affecting the economy?

886
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:52,995
- Did you know Ford was on the Warren Commission?
- Who cares? He's out of there this fall.

887
00:58:53,097 --> 00:58:54,997
Look, we need some alcohol.

888
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,590
That's a thought.

889
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:25,795
Say, man.

890
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:29,128
Why don't you run over to the Centennial
and pick me up a sixer of this stuff.

891
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,724
Think you can do that?

892
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:34,937
- Thanks, man.
- Good luck!

893
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:40,641
I'm just saying, if we're gonna drive
around, we should just do something ?Ohh!

894
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,645
Yeah. You know, you're right, man.

895
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:47,650
I'm just gonna, you know, get drunk,
maybe get laid, or get in a fight.

896
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,186
No, I'm serious, man! We
should be up for anything!

897
00:59:50,288 --> 00:59:52,188
I know. We are. But what?

898
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:56,727
I mean, God, don't you ever feel like everything
we do and everything we've been taught...

899
00:59:56,828 --> 00:59:58,728
is just to service the future?

900
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,094
Yeah, I know. It's like
it's all preparation.

901
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:03,997
Right. But what are we
preparing ourselves for?

902
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:06,229
- Death.
- Life of the party.

903
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,237
It's true.

904
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,239
You know, but that's valid.

905
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:14,243
Because if we're all gonna die anyway,
shouldn't we be enjoying ourselves now?

906
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:17,337
You know? I'd like to quit thinking
of the present ?like, right now ?

907
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:21,077
as some minor, insignificant
preamble to somethin' else.

908
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:26,748
Exactly! That's what everybody in this car needs
?some good old, worthwhile visceral experience.

909
01:00:27,859 --> 01:00:30,919
Remember to eat a green thing every day.

910
01:00:31,029 --> 01:00:32,929
And have lots of calcium.

911
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:36,432
It's very important for young
mothers to have lots of calcium.

912
01:00:36,534 --> 01:00:39,594
- There you are. See you tomorrow night.
- Bye.

913
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:43,299
- How are you this evening?
- Pretty good. How's it goin'?

914
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:46,309
Be goin' a lot better when I
get off in a couple of hours.

915
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:48,379
Yeah, I hear that.

916
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,008
- You're 18, right?
- Oh, yeah.

917
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,646
- Just graduated.
- Graduated. Congratulations.

918
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:03,056
- So, you off to college in the fall?
- Uh, you know, I'm still not sure.

919
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:05,527
I'm workin' right now for the city.

920
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:11,066
Thinkin' of holding on to the job for a
while. You know, it's money in my pocket.

921
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:13,933
I hear that. Here's some
more money for your pocket.

922
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,802
- You have a nice night tonight.
- Okay. Thanks.

923
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:19,376
Hey, take it easy.

924
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:23,570
Psst! Hey, Mitch.

925
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:27,650
Hey. There you guys are.

926
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:30,778
- Hey, man, what's in the bag?
- Ah, a sixer.

927
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:32,822
- You owe me one, man.
- Yeah.

928
01:01:32,924 --> 01:01:34,892
They busted the hell
out of Hirshfelder too.

929
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:37,859
- Yeah, I heard.
- Hey, man, you're over at the Emporium?

930
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:41,762
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, is that bastard O'Bannion over there?

931
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:44,960
Yes. I hate that jerk.

932
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:48,831
Do you guys wanna get him back?

933
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,373
- Hell yes.
- Yeah!

934
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,477
They really sold it to you?

935
01:02:01,586 --> 01:02:03,554
- Of course.
- Cool.

936
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,325
There you go, buddy.

937
01:02:10,428 --> 01:02:13,192
Whoo! Paycheck. Oh, yeah.

938
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:15,697
- Way to shoot, man.
- Thanks, bud.

939
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,701
Oh, yeah. He got it.

940
01:02:18,803 --> 01:02:21,704
- I got your change.
- Oh, don't worry about it, man.

941
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:24,206
- Got a beer for my partner.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:26,208
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

943
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:28,210
- All right.
- Guys.

944
01:02:28,312 --> 01:02:30,712
- Party at the moon tower.
- Oh, I'm there.

945
01:02:30,815 --> 01:02:33,875
You and Benny pick up the first keg.
I'm goin' to collect for the rest.

946
01:02:33,985 --> 01:02:35,885
Spread the word, man.

947
01:02:35,987 --> 01:02:37,887
Max, Phil, party at the moon tower.

948
01:02:37,989 --> 01:02:40,651
Hey, good game, man. You too.

949
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,158
Y'all are an embarrassment
to the sport of pool...

950
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:46,355
and you should be proud that I
even let you play at my table.

951
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:49,365
You are the worst pool player
I've ever seen in my life...

952
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:52,698
but if you keep watchin'me
you might learn somethin'!

953
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,931
Shit, you got so many balls on the table, I'm
gonna have to start knockin'your balls in...

954
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,940
just to get 'em out of my way.

955
01:02:58,042 --> 01:02:59,942
- Okay.
- Corner pocket.

956
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:01,944
- Hey, check this out.
- Easy money.

957
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,946
God, you are terrible!

958
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:08,747
Okay, homo, I hope you are ready to taste
the agonizing, bitter humiliation of defeat.

959
01:03:08,853 --> 01:03:10,753
You ready?

960
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:13,756
So, did you hear they're
busting Carl Burnett out back?

961
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:15,758
- Whoa-whoa. What did
you say? - About what?

962
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,352
- Carl Burnett. What about him?
- I just heard he's gettin' busted. I don't know.

963
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,363
Benny, they got Burnett
in the back. Let's go.

964
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,228
- Carl Burnett? Outside?
- Yeah. They got him.

965
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:25,234
- Let's go.
- Let me finish this game.

966
01:03:25,336 --> 01:03:27,236
- Fine. I'm gettin' out.
- Hold him for me!

967
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,203
All right, all right!

968
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:33,844
Hey, man. ThatJulie chick? Loves you.

969
01:03:33,945 --> 01:03:35,845
Oh, yeah. You want her?

970
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:38,848
Gotta play it cool, you know. Can't
let her know how much you like her.

971
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,851
'Cause if she knows, she'll
dump you like that. Believe me.

972
01:03:41,953 --> 01:03:46,720
If she asks you to ride out there with her,
you don't do it. Say, "Nah. Got my own ride.

973
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,724
But maybe I'll see you later. "

974
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:51,056
Sounds stupid, doesn't it? It works.

975
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,892
Whoo-ee! Whee! We got
another one, huh, fellas?

976
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:57,900
Whoa-whoa-whoa. Guys, guys. You
wouldn't mind if I went first, would ya?

977
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,902
Is that all right?

978
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:03,838
It's kind of a personal thing between
me and this little piece of shit here.

979
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,842
So... we meet again, huh?

980
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:12,075
Did y'all hear this little motherfucker's
mom pulled a shotgun on me this afternoon?

981
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,083
Fuckin' bitch.

982
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:16,517
Y
- You haven't had any licks yet, have you?

983
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:18,521
- Hmm?
- No.

984
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:21,490
Whoo! Another cherry, boys.

985
01:04:21,592 --> 01:04:23,719
Man, get the fuck up against the wall!

986
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:27,764
You have to be the dumbest freshman,
skinny little cocksucking son of a bitch...

987
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,299
to be out here tonight.

988
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:32,301
You knew I was gonna find you.

989
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:35,304
I would like to dedicate
this first lick...

990
01:04:35,406 --> 01:04:37,499
to your mother...

991
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:39,576
fucker.

992
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,380
Not yet.

993
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:46,382
Oh! It's gettin' warmer.

994
01:04:46,484 --> 01:04:48,452
What the fuck?

995
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,958
Remember me, you pig?

996
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:02,461
#I walked through the halls ofkarma #

997
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,466
Let's go, man! Come on!

998
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,594
What the fuck is the matter with
you? How 'bout some fucking backup?

999
01:05:07,705 --> 01:05:09,605
- Let's go!
- I'm hurryin'!

1000
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:11,607
Fuckin'scumbags!

1001
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:14,906
It was beautiful! You should have
seen the look on that fuck's face!

1002
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:16,912
- Get in!
- We got that bastard!

1003
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:24,113
Jesus! You let that
little fuck get away!

1004
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,917
What is the matter with
you? It's fuckin' pitiful!

1005
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,083
Fuck!

1006
01:05:29,193 --> 01:05:31,559
Freshman shitheads.

1007
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:34,324
What the fuck are you lookin' at? Huh?

1008
01:05:34,432 --> 01:05:36,900
I'll kick your fuckin' ass right now!

1009
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:40,069
Pussy.

1010
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:48,608
What are you smilin' at, you
little freshman faggot? Huh?

1011
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:52,542
Fuck you.

1012
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,948
Fuck all of you! Fuck you!

1013
01:05:57,188 --> 01:05:59,156
Goddamn it!

1014
01:06:05,563 --> 01:06:07,463
Oh, man!

1015
01:06:07,565 --> 01:06:11,160
O'Bannion finally got
his paint job Whoa!

1016
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,380
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1017
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,882
I swore to God I'd never
come to a Top Notch...

1018
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:30,420
and here I am sorting through
jalapeo burgers and soggy fries.

1019
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,421
Here, take 'em.

1020
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:36,289
- All right, all right!
- Oh, Christ.

1021
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:39,522
How ya doin'?

1022
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:42,155
- Pretty good.
- Cool.

1023
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:44,700
You heard about the
party bein' busted, right?

1024
01:06:44,802 --> 01:06:47,703
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Not to worry.

1025
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,706
There's a new fiesta in
the making as we speak.

1026
01:06:50,808 --> 01:06:52,708
It's out at the moon tower.

1027
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:56,405
Full kegs. Everybody's gonna
be there. You oughta go.

1028
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:58,414
Okay.

1029
01:06:58,516 --> 01:07:00,347
- Okay, we'll be there.
- Okay.

1030
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,113
- Say, you need a ride?
- Uh, no, I got my own car.

1031
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,120
- Thanks.
- Yeah, well, listen.

1032
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:08,123
You oughta ditch the two geeks you're
in the car with now and get in with us.

1033
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:11,126
But that's all right. We'll
worry about that later.

1034
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:14,857
- I will see you there. All right?
- Bye.

1035
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:17,297
I love those redheads, man.

1036
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:19,801
I know you!

1037
01:07:19,904 --> 01:07:22,532
We had geography together. Remember?

1038
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,837
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God.

1039
01:07:25,943 --> 01:07:27,843
What a dick!

1040
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:30,345
That was so creepy.

1041
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:33,349
- Why are you smiling?
- I thought he was cute.

1042
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,851
- Oh, that's disgusting!
- You thought he was cute?

1043
01:07:35,953 --> 01:07:38,854
Do you realize when he graduated
we were, like, three years old?

1044
01:07:38,956 --> 01:07:42,084
Oh, Cynthia, what are you thinking?

1045
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:44,093
I don't know.

1046
01:07:44,195 --> 01:07:47,096
So, are we gonna still go?

1047
01:07:47,198 --> 01:07:49,291
- Yeah, what the hell.
- I guess.

1048
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:02,708
Ohh! Get back!

1049
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:15,324
Hey, Wood is here for
the quarter race, baby!

1050
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:18,259
- Hey, Benny. You better have your wood screws ?
- Fuck you!

1051
01:08:18,362 --> 01:08:20,990
'Cause I'm gonna blow
your doors completely off!

1052
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:57,727
Yeah!

1053
01:09:34,505 --> 01:09:37,906
Well, someone's tokin' some reefer.

1054
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:42,010
Take care of this.

1055
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:44,239
Hey, man. Hey. Slow down. What's up?

1056
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,816
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- What'd you just say?

1057
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,475
When?

1058
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:52,078
Just now, man, when you
walked past. What'd you say?

1059
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,679
A
- About what?

1060
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:57,317
You said, "Someone's
tokin' some reefer. "

1061
01:09:57,428 --> 01:10:00,420
No, I may have said something
about smelling some pot.

1062
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,261
- You know, it was just an observation.
- Oh, an observation, huh?

1063
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:06,359
Well, who the hell are you,
man? Isaac fuckin' Newton?

1064
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,337
Well, guess what, genius. I'm the
one smoking marijuana, motherfucker.

1065
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,704
- You got a problem with that?
- No. Of course not.

1066
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:16,610
Then why'd you say that, chief? Don't let
your mouth write a check your butt can't cash.

1067
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:19,148
So I'm blazin' with my friends.
So I'm a fuckin' pothead, man.

1068
01:10:19,249 --> 01:10:22,650
What's it to you? Huh? What's the
matter, pussy? Out of observations?

1069
01:10:22,753 --> 01:10:25,950
Why don't you observe while I punch
your teeth down your fuckin' throat!

1070
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:28,957
Dude, relax! Relax!
He's cool, man. Relax.

1071
01:10:29,059 --> 01:10:32,551
Hey, I'll be watching you, Newton. I
only came here to do two things, man.

1072
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:35,097
Kick some ass and drink some beer.

1073
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,657
Looks like we're almost out of beer.

1074
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:42,000
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

1075
01:10:47,144 --> 01:10:49,544
Why is it called the moon tower, anyway?

1076
01:10:49,647 --> 01:10:55,017
Uh, I guess they decided to put it up out here
whenever they were building the power plant.

1077
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,019
Actually, it's a good idea.

1078
01:10:57,121 --> 01:11:00,522
You got a full moon out here
every day of the year. You know?

1079
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:02,524
Yeah, but nothing's
ever been repaired...

1080
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:05,527
so this whole place could
fall down at any time.

1081
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:07,790
So you'd better watch your step, junior.

1082
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:14,200
This place used to be off limits, man,
'cause of some drunk freshman who fell off.

1083
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:18,035
He went right down the middle,
smackin' his head on every beam, man.

1084
01:11:18,142 --> 01:11:20,770
I hear it doesn't hurt after
the first couple, though.

1085
01:11:20,878 --> 01:11:24,109
Autopsy said he had one beer,
man. How many did you have?

1086
01:11:24,214 --> 01:11:26,114
Four.

1087
01:11:26,216 --> 01:11:28,116
You're dead, man. You're so dead.

1088
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:31,381
Look at the bloodstains right there.

1089
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:33,456
Shut up.

1090
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:37,358
I'm gonna get that guy.

1091
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:40,760
- What guy?
- That asshole on the way in ?Clint.

1092
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:44,265
Super-dominant male in
a '50s greaser uniform.

1093
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:46,268
I wouldn't suggest that, Mike.

1094
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:48,270
Look, man, I got it all planned out.

1095
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:51,273
Most fights in places like this never get
past a punch or two before they're broken up.

1096
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:54,276
There's almost a natural
instinct not to upset the herd.

1097
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:57,279
So all I gotta do is get in one
good punch, play defense and wait.

1098
01:11:57,381 --> 01:12:00,282
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1099
01:12:00,384 --> 01:12:03,285
I- I-I guess at first I was relieved
to get out of the situation...

1100
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,787
but now there's this level
of humiliation setting in...

1101
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,289
that I can tell is gonna
be with me for-fucking-ever!

1102
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:10,792
I'm just not gonna let this
be yet another situation...

1103
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:13,988
which contributes to me being a little,
ineffectual nothing the rest of my life.

1104
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:20,168
Would you look at
this fucking town, man.

1105
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,431
It's dead.

1106
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:28,409
Imagine how many people out
there right now are fucking, man.

1107
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,414
Step inside my head ?

1108
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,950
Just goin' at it.

1109
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:40,449
- Hey.
- Hey.

1110
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,957
- Remember me?
- Sure. You're Sabrina, right?

1111
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,652
Right.

1112
01:12:44,762 --> 01:12:46,662
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

1113
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:48,823
- Hey, let's go.
- What brings you here?

1114
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:51,400
Oh, just hanging out.

1115
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:55,834
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

1116
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,839
Yeah.

1117
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:01,502
So, uh ?does your offer from
this afternoon still stand?

1118
01:13:03,614 --> 01:13:06,674
What am I say supposed to
say? "Anything you want. "

1119
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:18,026
Why did we even come here?

1120
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:21,029
I always feel a little out of
place at these things, you know.

1121
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:23,622
You're telling me. I'm
being stalked by a Nazi.

1122
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:26,635
Is that a little bit of
reefer I smell on you, boy?

1123
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:29,171
Coach is right. You're runnin'
with that bad crowd again.

1124
01:13:29,273 --> 01:13:32,174
You've got an attitude adjustment
you've gotta make right now.

1125
01:13:32,276 --> 01:13:35,575
Like I'm the only athlete at this
fuckin' party. Look at you two drunks.

1126
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,171
Coach is right, though. Those guys
don't care if we win or lose, bro.

1127
01:13:39,283 --> 01:13:41,649
Just remember that.

1128
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:43,652
- Check this out. Watch this ?
- Yeah?

1129
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:47,190
Watch me get this beer. Watch.

1130
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:49,191
Oh, no! It's the cops!

1131
01:13:49,293 --> 01:13:51,090
- Look! Look!
- Shit!

1132
01:13:51,195 --> 01:13:53,095
Look, look, look! That was so easy.

1133
01:13:53,197 --> 01:13:57,361
Oh, shit. He needs another
drink, you know, bad.

1134
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:10,747
All right!

1135
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,406
Hey! Mitch!

1136
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,409
- Hey!
- How's it goin'?

1137
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,411
I was wondering if you were around here.

1138
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:47,541
Oh, man!

1139
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:51,747
So, uh, I just wanted
to talk, you know...

1140
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:53,823
about you quittin' football.

1141
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:56,925
Or is it just this pledge?

1142
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:59,928
You don't wanna sign the
pledge, right? That's what it is.

1143
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,555
I don't know, man.

1144
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:06,696
Maybe I'm not into any of it anymore.

1145
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:10,573
- You're not into any of it anymore.
- Yeah.

1146
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:16,878
It'd be the biggest mistake of your
life, Pink. No one quits senior year, pal.

1147
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,710
Especially if you're
starting quarterback.

1148
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:22,876
I mean, we got a shot at state.

1149
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:25,454
We'll kick some butt this year.

1150
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:30,126
It's what we've been working
for all of our lives, man.

1151
01:15:30,227 --> 01:15:33,560
Me and you. Benny. We're
gonna be champions together.

1152
01:15:33,664 --> 01:15:38,931
Look, man, all I'm saying is
that if I do play next year...

1153
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:41,937
it's gonna be on my terms, not theirs.

1154
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:44,735
You just remember one thing, Pink?

1155
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:48,709
it ain't just about you, pal,
it's about us ?me, Donny, Mel.

1156
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:51,508
You'd be fuckin' us over.

1157
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:53,674
Or maybe you'rejust fuckin'scared, huh?

1158
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:57,387
Have a nice night.

1159
01:16:41,465 --> 01:16:44,366
Do you guys know what that song's about?

1160
01:16:44,468 --> 01:16:46,436
It's about aliens.

1161
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:51,337
We're the aliens,
man. We're the savages.

1162
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,274
- We're the savages.
- Wait, man. That song is about that?

1163
01:16:54,378 --> 01:16:57,211
- Yeah, man, that song's about that.
- About aliens?

1164
01:16:57,314 --> 01:16:59,214
Yeah, man. You didn't know that?

1165
01:16:59,316 --> 01:17:03,514
This country's founded ?It was founded
by people who were into aliens, man.

1166
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:08,250
George Washington, man, he was in a
cult, and the cult was into aliens, man.

1167
01:17:08,358 --> 01:17:10,258
- You didn't know that?
- No.

1168
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,885
Oh, man, they were way into
that type of stuff, man.

1169
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:15,624
It's like the every-other-decade
theory. You know?

1170
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:19,293
The '50s were boring, the '60s rocked...

1171
01:17:19,403 --> 01:17:22,031
and the '70s ?Oh, my
God, they obviously suck.

1172
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:24,039
Right? Come on.

1173
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,439
Maybe the '80s will
be radical. You know?

1174
01:17:26,543 --> 01:17:30,035
I figure we'll be in our 20s
and, hey, it can't get any worse.

1175
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:49,898
Wait a minute.

1176
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,400
Who put the keg way
out here in the woods?

1177
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:55,403
I don't know. This is just
where they told me it would be.

1178
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:57,905
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1179
01:17:58,008 --> 01:18:00,476
- Huh.
- I don't think we need beer anyway.

1180
01:18:03,213 --> 01:18:06,011
- George toked weed, man?
- Absolutely, George toked weed.

1181
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:09,017
Are you kidding me, man? He
grew fields of that stuff.

1182
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,019
That's what I'm talking about. Fields!

1183
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:15,080
- He grew that shit up at Mount Vernon, man.
- Mount Vernon? He grew it all over the country.

1184
01:18:15,192 --> 01:18:18,093
He had people growin'it
all over the country.

1185
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:21,096
The whole country back then was
gettin'high. Let me tell you, man.

1186
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:23,826
'Cause?'Cause?'Cause he knew.
He was onto somethin', man.

1187
01:18:23,934 --> 01:18:28,166
He knew that it would be a good cash
crop for the Southern states, man...

1188
01:18:28,271 --> 01:18:30,171
so he grew fields of it, man.

1189
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:34,300
But you know what? Behind
every good man there's a woman.

1190
01:18:34,411 --> 01:18:36,311
And that woman was
Martha Washington, man.

1191
01:18:36,413 --> 01:18:40,315
And every day, George would come home,
she'd have a big, fat bowl waiting for him...

1192
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:42,317
when he'd come in the door, man.

1193
01:18:42,419 --> 01:18:44,444
She was a hip ?a hip, hip lady, man.

1194
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,365
Mm-mmm. Wait a minute.

1195
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,370
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1196
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:04,702
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1197
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:06,776
Don't you have a girlfriend?

1198
01:19:09,346 --> 01:19:12,611
- What girlfriend?
- What's-her-name.

1199
01:19:12,716 --> 01:19:16,152
Simone. Hmm?

1200
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,590
And she was real cool too.

1201
01:19:22,692 --> 01:19:25,593
She'd harvest the crops, man.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1202
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,596
She'd put it in the ?in the, um,
bushels and stuff and sell it, you know.

1203
01:19:28,698 --> 01:19:31,599
Because they had to
make ends meet and stuff.

1204
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:34,101
I mean, did you ever look
at a dollar bill, man?

1205
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:38,334
There's some spooky stuff going on on
a dollar bill, man. And it's green too!

1206
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,341
- Later.
- See ya.

1207
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:43,344
- Cool.
- Wait, wait, wait. What was that all about?

1208
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,415
- What were you doin' back there, guy?
- Exactly what you two clowns wish you were doin'.

1209
01:19:46,516 --> 01:19:48,416
- Look at him.
- Look at your boy.

1210
01:19:48,518 --> 01:19:50,418
Kramer!

1211
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,014
Yeah, you, you, you. Freshman. Right
here. Come on. Right here, buddy.

1212
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:58,720
- What is he doing?
- I don't know. What is this wave shit?

1213
01:19:58,828 --> 01:20:02,025
- Freshman! Over here right now.
- Over here. Now.

1214
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:04,032
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

1215
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:07,035
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Shit. I should go.

1216
01:20:07,137 --> 01:20:10,402
- Yeah, I guess you probably should.
- Shit. I'll be back.

1217
01:20:10,507 --> 01:20:12,475
Okay.

1218
01:20:12,576 --> 01:20:14,976
- He's like a little Casanova.
- Yeah.

1219
01:20:15,078 --> 01:20:17,478
- It's amazing. - Look at this
shit-eating grin on his face.

1220
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:19,981
- Was I right?
- Not bad for a little freshman.

1221
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,483
But you better watch
out for them older girls.

1222
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,486
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come
here, come here, come here.

1223
01:20:24,588 --> 01:20:27,785
All right, all right. We just
wanna know something. Okay?

1224
01:20:27,891 --> 01:20:31,793
Are you gonna be fuckin' that later,
or are you gonna be a little wimp? Huh?

1225
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:34,796
How do you know I haven't already?

1226
01:20:34,898 --> 01:20:37,799
Get outta here! I think
it's past your bedtime!

1227
01:20:37,901 --> 01:20:40,802
- Run along.
- Come here. Come here, come here.

1228
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:44,806
Why don't you go get a ride
with her. Say we left you.

1229
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:47,536
It'll work. It'll work. Go.

1230
01:20:47,644 --> 01:20:50,272
- Hey, Kramer. Show it to her.
- Yeah.

1231
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,507
- Give it to her. Go!
- Go, boy.

1232
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,423
Air raid, freshman.

1233
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:04,425
What?

1234
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:06,586
Air raid, freshman.

1235
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:09,688
- Oh, come on, Darla. Leave her alone.
- No, Tony, this is between me and her.

1236
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:13,030
And she'd better be on the ground i
- in five seconds.

1237
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:18,106
Wait, she doesn't have to air-raid
because she's with me. Okay?

1238
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:22,277
Air-raid, or it's your ass.

1239
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:24,370
Don't do it, Sabrina.

1240
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:26,381
Oh, that's it...

1241
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:28,951
Miss Hot Stuff.

1242
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:34,879
I'm gonna make the next year
of your life a living hell.

1243
01:21:42,799 --> 01:21:45,029
Lick me! All of you!

1244
01:21:45,135 --> 01:21:47,695
Hey, Darla.

1245
01:21:47,804 --> 01:21:50,534
Good for you.

1246
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,541
Don't air-raid for that
bitch. I hate that shit.

1247
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:56,544
It's like that Clint fucker
in front of all his friends.

1248
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:58,876
- "Huh? Huh, motherfucker?"
- All right! Okay, Mike.

1249
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:00,973
Dominant male monkey motherfucker!

1250
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:03,712
God!

1251
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:06,721
T- A-R-A.

1252
01:22:06,823 --> 01:22:10,224
I never met a Tara
before. You're my first.

1253
01:22:10,327 --> 01:22:12,420
Hey, what the ?

1254
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:15,259
All right!

1255
01:22:15,365 --> 01:22:18,528
- He did it! I can't believe it!
- Fuckin' knew I should have kicked your ass!

1256
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:21,297
Come on! Come on, man!

1257
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:23,895
- Come on! Hold still!
- Yeah!

1258
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:27,204
- Stop now!
- Oh, yeah! Hold still!

1259
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:29,574
- You guys, come on.
- It's that Clint. That crazy bastard.

1260
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,375
- You like this? You like this, motherfucker?
- Come on, Clint! Come on!

1261
01:22:32,482 --> 01:22:35,178
Where you goin'?

1262
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:41,621
Whoo-hoo! Kick his ass!

1263
01:22:41,725 --> 01:22:44,057
Come on, man! You want some
more? You fuckin' bitch!

1264
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,756
Come on, man! Come here!

1265
01:22:48,865 --> 01:22:51,026
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Get off him!

1266
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,762
- Get the fuck off me!
- Come on!

1267
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:58,307
- Come on. Stay down!
- Fuckin' dick! You fucking fascist!

1268
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:01,639
You got fuckin' smoked! Come
on, man! You want some more?

1269
01:23:01,745 --> 01:23:04,646
Fuckin' dick!

1270
01:23:32,242 --> 01:23:34,142
Hey.

1271
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:37,145
Hey, little brother.

1272
01:23:37,247 --> 01:23:39,647
- Is that a beer in your hand?
- Why, yes, it is.

1273
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:42,149
Have you had more than
one of those tonight?

1274
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:44,812
A few, I guess, but nobody's counting.

1275
01:23:44,921 --> 01:23:47,822
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi.

1276
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:52,554
Guess I might as well just get used to you
being at the same social functions as me, huh?

1277
01:23:52,662 --> 01:23:55,062
And, uh, hanging out with people I know?

1278
01:23:55,165 --> 01:23:58,362
What time are you supposed
to be home, anyway?

1279
01:23:58,468 --> 01:24:01,369
Oh, geez, I don't
know. Couple hours ago.

1280
01:24:01,471 --> 01:24:03,871
That's bullshit.

1281
01:24:03,973 --> 01:24:06,305
That's major bullshit.

1282
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:09,310
Mom barely let me out of the
house when I was your age.

1283
01:24:09,412 --> 01:24:11,312
- Aww!
- "Aww!"

1284
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:15,180
Don't think she's not gonna be waiting up for
you when you get home, because she will be.

1285
01:24:15,285 --> 01:24:18,186
- I've been through it, and she's tough.
- Yeah, well ?

1286
01:24:18,288 --> 01:24:21,746
Just don't ask her to
take it easy on me, please.

1287
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:27,324
What's that supposed to
mean? Take it easy on him?

1288
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,729
- Let's go smoke that joint.
- He's in for a surprise.

1289
01:24:39,509 --> 01:24:43,468
- # Tuesday's gone #

1290
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:47,072
# With the wind #

1291
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:53,915
- # Tuesday's gone with the wind ##
- All right! Good.

1292
01:24:54,023 --> 01:24:56,491
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Hey, man, no worries.

1293
01:24:56,593 --> 01:24:58,493
- Take care.
- All right.

1294
01:24:58,595 --> 01:25:00,495
- Pick you up tomorrow, 4:00?
- Okay.

1295
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:02,497
Hey.

1296
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:05,329
Aerosmith. Three weeks.
Front row seats, babe.

1297
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:07,335
All right. I won't forget.

1298
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:12,340
So, uh, who's buying breakfast?

1299
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:14,342
- Not me.
- I will, I guess.

1300
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:16,344
- You coming along?
- Sure.

1301
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:18,346
- Night, John Boy. Ali.
- Good night.

1302
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,850
"Wood-a-been. "
What's going on?

1303
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,852
Pink, my man. What's happenin'?

1304
01:25:24,954 --> 01:25:27,286
- Not a lot.
- Cynthia, man?

1305
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,654
- I like her, man. Very nice.
- Yeah?

1306
01:25:29,759 --> 01:25:32,387
- Red's a good color for you.
- My favorite color.

1307
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:35,589
- Have you seen Jodi around?
- Man, she left your ass.

1308
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:39,190
Really? Well, you win
some, you lose some.

1309
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:41,202
What about Peter Frampton?

1310
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:43,204
- I like him.
- Hey!

1311
01:25:43,306 --> 01:25:46,366
- Slater, what's happenin', man?
- What's goin' on, man?

1312
01:25:46,476 --> 01:25:48,706
- Guys, what's goin' on?
- Nothing!

1313
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:52,076
- Pickford, what do you know?
- What time is it? God.

1314
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:54,081
Let's go smoke a joint, man!

1315
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:58,882
On the 50-fuckin'- yard line, in
honor of your daddy, Coach Conrad.

1316
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:01,616
We're there! Great idea!

1317
01:26:01,724 --> 01:26:04,215
- The man with the plan.
- Wanna come with me?

1318
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:06,227
Okay.

1319
01:26:06,329 --> 01:26:08,229
Hey.

1320
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:11,767
Joint subcommittee meeting on
the 50 yard line in 15. You there?

1321
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:13,893
- Okay.
- Don, y'all ride with me, man.

1322
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,903
Let's hit it.

1323
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:18,132
- This is cashed, man.
- It's in there, man.

1324
01:26:18,241 --> 01:26:21,335
You can ride with us, man, but you're
ridin' in the back, 'cause I got shotgun.

1325
01:26:21,444 --> 01:26:23,571
- Yeah, yeah,
yeah. - H-Hey!

1326
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:27,047
Hey, hey, hey! Watch the leather, man!

1327
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:31,118
Oh, fuck it!

1328
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:37,190
- Don't you quit! Do you wanna hit him?
- He was wide open!

1329
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:40,785
- Do you want to hit him?
- Jesus, son! You're wearing Rebel gray!

1330
01:26:40,897 --> 01:26:43,297
- Now, break down! Break down!
- I'm sorry, Coach.

1331
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:45,959
I want you on him like stink
on shit! I say, stink on shit!

1332
01:26:46,069 --> 01:26:49,129
Break down! You don't deserve
to wear that Rebel gray, boy!

1333
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:52,833
You don't deserve to wear it! You
won't hit him? You won't hit him?

1334
01:26:52,942 --> 01:26:55,502
O.T.S.S! Only the strong survive!

1335
01:26:55,612 --> 01:26:57,512
- Only the strong survive!
- Only the strong survive, boy!

1336
01:26:57,614 --> 01:26:59,844
- Only the strong survive!
- That's it!

1337
01:26:59,949 --> 01:27:02,850
Now, where's your pitch man?
Hit your goddamn pitch man!

1338
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:09,182
He fumbles!

1339
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:12,193
Hey, man!

1340
01:27:12,295 --> 01:27:15,196
Hell, my grandmother
can hit harder than that!

1341
01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:17,698
What the fuck, man?

1342
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,701
Course, she's an 8 foot 4,
652-pound, hairy-ass gorilla...

1343
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:22,896
drives a Mack truck
and runs the 40 in 10.2.

1344
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:27,636
Hell, she's gotten bigger lately,
man. She was only 6'2", 195 in my day.

1345
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,712
Still drives that Mack truck though.

1346
01:27:29,812 --> 01:27:31,837
Hey, Pink, you got my papers, man?

1347
01:27:31,948 --> 01:27:34,314
Uh, yeah, there's some
in my glove compartment.

1348
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:38,080
I got 'em. Hit me on a slant.
Give me the keys to an inside.

1349
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:40,087
Hut. Down!

1350
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:42,953
Marijuana on one!

1351
01:27:43,059 --> 01:27:44,959
Reefer on two!

1352
01:27:45,061 --> 01:27:47,962
Hut! Hut!

1353
01:27:48,064 --> 01:27:50,862
- Wide open!

1354
01:27:50,967 --> 01:27:52,594
I got it! Sweet!

1355
01:27:52,702 --> 01:27:56,069
Oh!

1356
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:58,072
That's pretty good.

1357
01:27:58,174 --> 01:28:00,074
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

1358
01:28:00,176 --> 01:28:03,737
Could be, like, a little ?I don't know.
Maybe perhaps a little more symmetrical.

1359
01:28:03,846 --> 01:28:05,746
- Does that hurt?
- Oww!

1360
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:07,748
- Yes! PI ?It ?
- Sorry. Sorry.

1361
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,750
- It's a bruise.
- Okay.

1362
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:12,252
I don't know. Let me ask
you something, though.

1363
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:14,915
I mean, I got some
pretty good ones in there.

1364
01:28:15,024 --> 01:28:18,050
I mean, it's not like I ?You wouldn't
say I got my ass kicked, right?

1365
01:28:18,161 --> 01:28:20,061
Oh, no. You know ?I don't know.

1366
01:28:20,163 --> 01:28:23,724
After a couple years, people won't
even remember, really, who won or lost.

1367
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,733
Yeah ?No, you're right.

1368
01:28:25,835 --> 01:28:28,736
You read about, like, Jackson
Pollock or Ernest Hemingway?

1369
01:28:28,838 --> 01:28:31,238
You never read about who won or
lost, just, they got into a brawl.

1370
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,240
Right. Exactly.

1371
01:28:33,342 --> 01:28:36,243
Well, uh, thanks for the ride
and breakfast and everything.

1372
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:38,245
No problem.

1373
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:42,716
Sure is nice to pile on some pancakes and
syrup after a night of beer drinking, isn't it?

1374
01:28:46,022 --> 01:28:47,649
Um ?

1375
01:28:57,033 --> 01:28:59,331
Good night.

1376
01:29:11,981 --> 01:29:13,949
Good night.

1377
01:29:17,887 --> 01:29:20,583
- Hope you're not grounded or anything.
- Thanks.

1378
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:27,885
"Not to indulge in any alcohol,
drugs, sex after 12:00...

1379
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:29,897
or any other illegal activity?

1380
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:33,230
- Oh, not my shadow.
- Slater, pay me for that.

1381
01:29:33,336 --> 01:29:37,238
- Found that in your glove compartment, man.
- You're the third person who's given me this today.

1382
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,240
God.

1383
01:29:39,342 --> 01:29:41,742
What do you reckon you're gonna do?

1384
01:29:41,844 --> 01:29:45,177
I don't know. I'll probably end up signing
it. I just don't wanna give in so easy.

1385
01:29:45,281 --> 01:29:48,182
Man, it's the same bullshit
they tried to pull in my day.

1386
01:29:48,284 --> 01:29:52,345
If it ain't that piece of paper, it's some
other choice they're gonna try and make for ya.

1387
01:29:52,455 --> 01:29:56,949
You gotta do what Randall
"Pink" Floyd wants to do, man.

1388
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:02,759
And let me tell you this The older you do get, the
more rules they're gonna try to get you to follow.

1389
01:30:02,865 --> 01:30:06,494
You just gotta keep
livin', man. L- I-V-I-N.

1390
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:11,572
Man, if you're gonna
sign that paper, man...

1391
01:30:11,674 --> 01:30:15,701
you should throw a little grass right in
the middle, roll it up, sign the joint, man.

1392
01:30:15,812 --> 01:30:20,215
- That's gonna tell 'em something.
- That's what I'll do. Assholes.

1393
01:30:20,316 --> 01:30:24,582
Yeah, they're all assholes. But think about it.
We've had a lot of good times right here, Pink.

1394
01:30:24,687 --> 01:30:27,588
Yeah, I mean, come on,
Pink. I can't believe this.

1395
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:31,091
You act like you're so oppressed.
Man, you guys are kings of the school.

1396
01:30:31,194 --> 01:30:34,220
You get away with whatever you
want. What are you bitching about?

1397
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:38,596
Look, all I'm saying is, if I ever start
referring to these as the best years of my life...

1398
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:41,795
remind me to kill myself.

1399
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:46,068
All I'm saying is, I just
wanna look back and say...

1400
01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:50,612
that I did it the best I could
while I was stuck in this place...

1401
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:54,410
had as much fun as I could when
I was stuck in this place...

1402
01:30:54,517 --> 01:30:57,850
played as hard as I could when
I was stuck in this place...

1403
01:30:57,954 --> 01:31:00,855
dogged as many chicks as I could
when I was stuck in this place.

1404
01:31:03,693 --> 01:31:06,594
Yeah, right, Mr. Premature Ejaculation.

1405
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:11,462
Oh, that's good. That's good.

1406
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:13,467
- That's good, baby.
- You know it's true.

1407
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:16,402
- Is that the cops?
- What the hell?

1408
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,939
- Oh, shit.
- Hey! All of you!

1409
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:20,941
Get over here!

1410
01:31:21,043 --> 01:31:22,943
- Now!
- Hey, man, ditch that pot.

1411
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,445
Is it illegal to be
on the football field?

1412
01:31:25,548 --> 01:31:28,449
- I got some more in this fuckin' bag.
- Dump it, dump it, dump it.

1413
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:30,451
Come on, Slater.

1414
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:32,453
What'd we do?

1415
01:31:32,555 --> 01:31:34,523
You got any Visine?

1416
01:31:35,858 --> 01:31:38,156
Man, I can't believe this.

1417
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:42,755
If it ain't ol'Richard
Wrath. How you doin', Dick?

1418
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:47,962
Well, well, well. Couple
of football players.

1419
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:51,733
Wonder what Coach is
gonna think of all this.

1420
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:54,139
Line up.

1421
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:57,745
- Wooderson.
- Slavey.

1422
01:31:57,847 --> 01:32:01,578
Relivin' old glories
on the football field?

1423
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,584
Get through there!

1424
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:07,281
You shouldn't still be mad 'cause
I got all-district and you didn't.

1425
01:32:38,354 --> 01:32:40,345
What?

1426
01:32:40,456 --> 01:32:43,653
Floyd! Dawson! Get your
scrawny butts over here.

1427
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:48,797
Mornin', Coach.

1428
01:32:50,733 --> 01:32:54,965
So what the hell's goin' on? Why am
I gettin' wake-up calls from the cops?

1429
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:57,972
- That was nothin'. They just left just now.
- False alarm, Coach.

1430
01:32:58,074 --> 01:33:00,042
Come here, Randy. Come here.

1431
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:04,575
You been out with
those losers all night?

1432
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,671
Hey, Coach Conrad.

1433
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:09,250
Remember me? Second period gym class?

1434
01:33:10,987 --> 01:33:13,387
That's the kind of people
I was telling you about.

1435
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:17,220
Trouble like this means nothing to that bunch
of clowns. You're the one with something to lose.

1436
01:33:17,326 --> 01:33:20,227
- Coach, you don't even know them.
- Randy?

1437
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:23,264
How can you even pretend
to talk that way? Huh?

1438
01:33:23,366 --> 01:33:27,598
Okay, Randy, I shouldn't do this, but I'm willing
to wipe the slate clean and forget about all this.

1439
01:33:27,703 --> 01:33:32,163
I want you to get your priorities straightened
out, quit hanging out with that bunch of hoodlums...

1440
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:34,708
and sign your commitment to your team.

1441
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:38,041
- Have you done that yet?
- I'm still thinkin' about it.

1442
01:33:38,147 --> 01:33:41,207
No one's paying you to think
about it. Just do it, son!

1443
01:33:42,952 --> 01:33:45,716
You know, Coach...

1444
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:47,721
I gotta get going.

1445
01:33:47,823 --> 01:33:51,020
Me and my loser friends, we
gotta go get Aerosmith tickets.

1446
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:53,095
Top priority of the summer.

1447
01:33:57,166 --> 01:34:00,897
Oh, uh, Coach, uh, I forgot.

1448
01:34:03,706 --> 01:34:06,231
I might play ball...

1449
01:34:06,342 --> 01:34:08,310
but I will never sign that.

1450
01:34:18,888 --> 01:34:20,788
Let's rock and roll.

1451
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:24,951
All right, man! Livin'!

1452
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:28,394
Shit, I'm gettin' my third
wind. Let's get on the road.

1453
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:31,398
- Let's go. You gonna come, man?
- Shotgun!

1454
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,400
Talk to you later, then.

1455
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:36,596
- You guys not goin'?
- Can I use your keys?

1456
01:34:36,705 --> 01:34:38,969
- Yeah.
- Time to boogie on outta here.

1457
01:34:39,075 --> 01:34:40,975
- Hey.
- Let's do it.

1458
01:34:41,077 --> 01:34:43,045
So that's that, huh?

1459
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,147
All right.

1460
01:34:47,249 --> 01:34:49,615
Slate. Aah!

1461
01:34:49,718 --> 01:34:51,686
I never get shotgun.

1462
01:35:06,702 --> 01:35:09,034
Uh, hi, Mom.

1463
01:35:09,138 --> 01:35:11,902
Mmm, okay, Mitchell.

1464
01:35:13,109 --> 01:35:16,010
This is your one
get-out-of-jail-free card...

1465
01:35:16,112 --> 01:35:18,012
so I hope you enjoyed it.

1466
01:35:18,114 --> 01:35:20,014
No.

1467
01:35:20,116 --> 01:35:23,643
Your sister told me everything, so
I've decided to make this deal with you.

1468
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:27,552
I'm ?I'm gonna be
open-minded about it this time.

1469
01:35:27,656 --> 01:35:31,717
But... next time you
come in at sunrise...

1470
01:35:31,827 --> 01:35:33,795
we've got problems.

1471
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:45,904
And, uh, who is this older
girl who gave you a ride?

1472
01:35:46,008 --> 01:35:48,067
She's just, like ?

1473
01:35:48,177 --> 01:35:50,509
Have you been drinking?

1474
01:35:50,613 --> 01:35:52,547
No!

1475
01:35:52,648 --> 01:35:54,377
Are you drunk?
