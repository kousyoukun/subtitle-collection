I'm headed this way.

23
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,760
- Later.
- So, what did we decide?

24
00:03:01,868 --> 00:03:04,393
- About what?
- About tonight.

25
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:07,384
Oh, uh, look, I'll
probably get, you know,

26
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,464
hung up with the guys
maybe, you know, later.

27
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:11,544
- Why don't we just meet at the party?
- All right.

28
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:14,195
Wouldn't want you waitin'
around for me all night anyway.

29
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:15,172
All right. Whatever.

30
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:17,216
- Cool. I'll see ya later?
- Bye.

31
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:19,217
Bye.

32
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:32,957
- Slater-san.
- Hey, man.

33
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:39,329
- How's it goin'?
- Fixin' to be a lot better, man.

34
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:43,237
- What time is your party tonight, man?
- 9:30, man.

35
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:45,243
9:30. Hmm.

36
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:49,406
Okay. Um, I'll be there, man.

37
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,416
Slater, alligator.

38
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:54,681
Wait, wait.
I gotta cruise by this afternoon...

39
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:57,621
on a little business,
if you know what I'm talkin' about, so …

40
00:03:57,724 --> 00:04:01,592
<i>- That's what you're talkin'about.
- That's what I'm talkin' about, man.</i>

41
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:04,061
Oh, man, I'm fuckin' wasted.

42
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:10,632
Walkin' down the hall by myself.

43
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,864
Smokin' a "J" with 50 elves.

44
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:15,440
- Later.
- Woodward. Bernstein.

45
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,404
Guess that makes you Deep Throat.

46
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:21,912
- So, is this a smoked or a liquid lunch?
- Hey.

47
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:23,915
Smoked, right?

48
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:26,952
- So, guys, are we gonna play poker tonight?
- Count me out.

49
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,489
Uh, I'll probably be going to
Pickford's party later, okay? So …

50
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,558
- No. We should do somethin' like that.
- Yeah.

51
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,321
- Goodwin's on his senior trip.
We can play poker anytime.
- Go to a party?

52
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:37,055
- "Go to a p …"? Come on.
- Come on.

53
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:38,630
- Mike. Cynthia.
- It's under control.

54
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,709
I don't feel comfortable
at those kinds of things.

55
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,530
Pick us up at 8:00.

56
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,534
- Okay. All right.
- It's gonna be all right.

57
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:46,901
- Guess we're going to the party. Okay.
- All right.

58
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:51,375
Oh, Mike. I gotta tell you
about this dream I had last night.

59
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:53,378
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- But, um...

60
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,505
- you gotta promise not to tell anyone.
- Yeah, sure.

61
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,606
- No. Say, "I promise."
- Jesus.

62
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:00,151
- I promise not to tell anyone.
- Okay, thank you.

63
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:02,153
Um, well …

64
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:05,418
Okay, there I am, and I'm gettin' it on …

65
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:07,857
You know, with what had
this perfect female body.

66
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,861
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,056
But …

68
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:14,429
- What? What? What?
- Um, I can't say.

69
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:17,526
Come on, man. You can't give
a buildup like that and not deliver.

70
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:20,470
I mean, come on. A perfect female body.
It's not a bad start.

71
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:23,932
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.

72
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:27,206
- Ah.
- I mean, the hat and the beard.

73
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,111
Oh, well. Best not think
too deeply on this one, right?

74
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:34,345
- Best not.
- Um, I gotta get some stuff from Mr. Birchfield.

75
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:38,584
- Uh, see you in a few minutes.
- I understand. Right. I'm sorry.

76
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:41,626
<i> Gilligan's transistor radio mouth.
Yeah. That was a good one.</i>

77
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,216
Hey. What about that one
where that sexy surfer guy...

78
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:48,695
catches that huge wave
and lands on the island?

79
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:51,464
<i>- Do you remember that?
- "Sexy surfer guy."</i>

80
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:54,131
<i>- The Mosquitoes. Do you remember that?
- Pink, let's go.</i>

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,668
<i>Come on.</i>

82
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:57,004
They were a rock group. Ginger
and Mary Ann formed their own group…

83
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,203
Look, man. I can't go yet
until Miss Wilk gets here.

84
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:02,472
So why don't you go get Benny and
check me out on the way back, okay?

85
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:03,043
All right.

86
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:06,778
- What?
- Coach gave me something to give to you.

87
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:12,657
<i>- They're really doing this.
- Yeah.</i>

88
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,819
<i>He wants them all back by the end of the day too.
Can you believe that one?</i>

89
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:18,295
- And everybody's signing it?
- Just to get him off our back.

90
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:21,094
The coaches are just being fucking assholes.
Know what I'm saying?

91
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:24,898
I mean, you sign it, you never
think about it again. Just let it go.

92
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:28,804
- You're gonna make a big deal
out of this, aren't you?

93
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:34,304
You …You're gettin' air from there, man.
It's no good. You see this?

94
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,314
It's gotta be tight.

95
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:40,409
- You're gonna have to put some gum
around the base of that to get a good hit.

96
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:45,348
Slate.

97
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:50,395
Benny. Psst.

98
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:53,193
<i>- Man, I ain't believin'that shit…
- Two minutes.</i>

99
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,859
<i>About Bonham's one-hour drum solo.</i>

100
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,836
<i>One hour of drums? You couldn't
handle that shit on strong acid, man.</i>

101
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,843
Okay.

102
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,805
Okay. We're gonna go to the bathroom.

103
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:09,882
Could you guys let Miss Wilks know?

104
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:14,083
All right. This is totally amazing.

105
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:17,748
"I voluntarily agree to not indulge
in any alcohol, drugs...

106
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:19,848
"or engage in any other illegal activity...

107
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,122
"that may in any way jeopardize
the years of hard work...

108
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:28,599
we as a team have committed to our goal
of a championship season in '76."

109
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:31,499
- What bullshit.
- The guys are actually signing this crap?

110
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:33,504
- Apparently.
- God, what are they gonna do next?

111
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:36,905
- Like, give you guys urine tests or something?
- I didn't know that drugs and alcohol...

112
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,672
were such a big problem
that they had to resort to neo-McCarthyism.

113
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,839
I think they're just afraid some of us
might be having too good a time.

114
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,008
It's the old age suppressing youth thing,
you know.

115
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:48,281
- "Neo-McCarthyism." I like that.
- Oh, that's good, Tony.

116
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:52,119
<i>And there you guys were in class trying to
list all the Gilligan's Island episodes...</i>

117
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:54,125
without even a hint of irony.

118
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:57,523
What in the hell are you talking about, girl?

119
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,622
<i>- You weren't thinking about it, were you?
- Gilligan's Island?</i>

120
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,668
It's what's called
a male pornographic fantasy.

121
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,330
- Oh, my…
- Think about it.

122
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:09,897
You're basically alone on a deserted island
with two readily available women.

123
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,739
<i>One, a seductive sex goddess type.</i>

124
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:16,611
The other, a healthy
girl-next-door type with a nice butt.

125
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:19,446
So guys have it all.
The Madonna and the whore.

126

<i>Women get nothing.</i>

127

<i>We get a geek,
an overweight middle-age guy...</i>

128
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:27,158
some nerdy scientific type.

129
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,252
<i>- I mean…
- The professor is sexy.</i>

130
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:32,763
<i>Pink, come on, man.</i>

131
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,459
We're off to raise some hell.
Look at that. Look at that!

132
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,627
<i>- Guys.

133
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:40,433
<i>- All right. Let's go kick some ass.
- Hey, you guys.</i>

134
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,440
- You guys, wait up.
- What?

135
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,169
- Benny.
- What?

136
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:46,336
- I have a favor to ask ya.
- What do you need?

137
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:48,380
Take it easy on my brother
this summer, okay?

138
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,381
- All of you.
- Mitch Kramer?

139
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:51,973
- Yeah. Mitch Kramer.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:55,282
- I'm gonna give him a beating he'll never forget.
- Ow!

141
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:58,221
Well, just don't get him
more than the other guys. Any of you.

142
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:00,690
- Kind of little. All right?
- Got our word, sis.

143
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:03,489
- Little brother'll be okay.
- Thanks. See you guys.

144
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:05,496
Ow!

145
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:07,623
Benny!

146
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,362
<i>- These guys. I don't know.
- Oh, you love it.</i>

147
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,371
Oh, there's just a little bit of bullshit
in all that, right?

148
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:15,634
Major bullshit. He's a dead man.
He's fuckin' dead.

149
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,209

- Shotgun!

150
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:24,080
<i> Check it out, boys, huh?
I've been waitin'three long years for this one.</i>

151
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:28,244
Those junior high kids are dead meat.
I promise you.

152
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:31,448
- Beat 'em!
- Oh, man. Oh, yeah.

153
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:43,433
Okay, all you freshman fucks.
Listen up.

154
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:44,629
<i>It's your lucky day.</i>

155
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,337
<i>Usually you'd be spending your freshman
summer getting your asses busted...</i>

156
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,671
<i>and running for
your worthless little lives...</i>

157
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:53,109
but this year,
because we feel so sorry for you...

158
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,703
<i>we're gonna take it easy on you...</i>

159
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:57,874
<i>and save us all a lot of time.</i>

160
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:01,010
So, if you meet here … right here …

161
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,020
after school today...

162
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:05,488
you only get one lick from each of us.

163
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,525
But you run like cowards …

164
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:12,223
<i>well, it's open season
all summer long, boys.</i>

165
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:14,891
Oh, yeah. Mitch Kramer?

166
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,731
<i>Mitchy. Mitchy, Mitchy, Mitchy.</i>

167
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,973
We're looking for you, pal.

168
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,599
Your ass will be purple
before the day is over.

169
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,711
Have a nice afternoon.

170
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:31,148
You better get out of town.

171
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,775
Go spend the summer
with your grandparents or somethin'.

172
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:38,918
Hey, man. You are gonna show up
to our game tonight, aren't you?

173
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:41,619
Yeah. I'm pitching. I kind of have to.

174
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:44,196
How should we inscribe
your tombstone?

175
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:47,864
How about "Ben Over"?

176
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:51,528
<i>Yeah, right, pissant.
Why aren't they after anybody else?</i>

177
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,605
<i>They are, man. Believe me.</i>

178
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:55,606
<i>I know, man.</i>

179
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:59,142
- Come on, Mel. Hop on.
- Let's go, boy.

180
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:10,255
Oh, shit.

181
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,359
Hey, Coach.

182
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,586
So, tell me.

183
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:20,564
<i>Any of you girls gonna be ready
to play some football this fall?</i>

184
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,566
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't know, Coach.

185
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:25,432
You know, uh, I been doing so good
in English classes, you know...

186
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:27,665
I figured I'd take next fall off
and become a writer.

187
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,742
What do you think about that, huh?

188
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:33,903
Boy, you wouldn't know how to write your name
if it wasn't stenciled on your locker.

189
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:37,471
No, seriously. Everybody.
Now, don't go getting soft on me this summer.

190
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:42,145
You know, you're sitting around
the pool all day, chasing the muff around.

191
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:44,382
Break down!

192
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,948
Hell, man. My grandmother's quicker
and tougher than you pansies.

193
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,960
Of course, she's 6'3", 250.

194
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:52,257
<i>Runs a 4.540.</i>

195
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,492
<i>What's the matter with you, Floyd?</i>

196
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,967
What, quarterbacks don't have to do
what their coaches say? Is that it?

197
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,334
Dawson, did you give him that pledge sheet?

198
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:03,408
<i>- The pledge sheet. You give it to him?
- Yeah, Coach. It's right here.</i>

199
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:07,741
Randy, if you could get that back to us by the end
of the day, we'd feel a lot better about it.

200
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:10,179
- You guys see that he does this, okay?
- All right, Coach.

201
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:12,183
<i>See ya, Coach.</i>

202
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:14,719
- Randy Floyd.
- Aw, shit.

203
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,780
Before next fall, you're in need of
a serious attitude adjustment, young man.

204
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,791
You better get your priorities straight.

205
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:24,852
And watch out with that other crowd you're
runnin' with. Don't think I haven't noticed.

206
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:27,364
<i>- Hey!
- Uh-oh, Pink.</i>

207
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:32,028
<i>I want that piece of paper on my desk
before you leave here today. Do you hear me?</i>

208
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:41,674
<i> Get an attitude adjustment.
You know what I mean?</i>

209
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:44,477
- Priorities straight, buddy.
- Runs with a bad crowd.

210
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:46,484
- Bad people.
- Watch yourself.

211
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:52,491
Yeah, well, I've got Coach's and everybody
else's attitude-adjusted priorities...

212
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:54,992
right here.

213
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:57,062
- Yeah, that's good, Pink.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:01,829
<i>Oh! Did you know O'Bannion flunked?</i>

215
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,902
<i>Yeah. What a dumb-shit.</i>

216
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:10,906
Whoo! Y'all ready to bust some ass?

217
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,069
- What's up, Don? Benny. Melvin.
- Hey.

218
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,079
- See ya later.
- Good to see ya.

219
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:17,672
Yeah.

220
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:20,718
Hey. We gotta take your truck.
I'm low on gas. All right?

221
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,380
- We need to take my truck?
- Yeah. Okay?

222
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:25,389
- Yeah.
- Good.

223
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:27,823
- What are you doing? Picking up trash?
- What? What?

224
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:31,522
Man, I was just waiting for one of them
idiot coaches to piss me off again.

225
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:33,895
I think you take the whole thing
a little too personal.

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,730
I think you just gotta …
You gotta shake it off.

227
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:39,896
Don, have you ever thought about
why we play football?

228
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:43,965
I mean, how many times have you gotten laid
strictly because you're a football player, huh?

229
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:48,878
I don't know. A few probably.

230
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:51,882
A few?
Don, all I'm saying is that...

231
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:55,943
I bet we could do just as well
if we were in a band or somethin'.

232
00:13:56,055 --> 00:13:58,455
Well, I gotta put in
a final appearance. So …

233
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:01,082
Wait a minute.
Who you got goin' in there? Shh.

234
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,762
Vicky. Vicky!

235
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:07,594
Come on. Let's skip out.
Let's go get naked right now. Let's go.

236
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,258
<i>Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.</i>

237
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:11,199
<i>- Mr. Dawson.
- Yeah.</i>

238
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:13,204
Why don't you take it somewhere else?

239
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,968
Oh, Mr. Floyd. Are you gracing us
with your presence today?

240
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:18,339
Uh, might as well.

241
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,642
You know, Ginny, I was thinking maybe
you and I can get together over the summer.

242
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:26,047
It'll be legal. We could make things happen.
I'll keep it mum's the word.

243
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:28,120
I promise. I swear to you.

244
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:36,024
At the party tonight, I heard
there's gonna be a girl with knockers this big.

245
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:38,062
- Bullshit.
- Promise. Two handfuls.
- Shut up, Carl.

246
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,064
- No way.
- Yes.

247
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,363
- Uh-uh.
- Hey. Psst. Hey.

248
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,869
<i>Pentico got his brother's car. Let's go.</i>

249
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:47,872
- Cool, man.
- Cool.

250
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,738
- Go talk to him.
- I'm not going alone.

251
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:53,368
Come on. Come on. Ask him.

252
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:56,414
<i>Uh, Mr. Payne, sir...</i>

253
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:59,916
you know, every second
that you could let us out early...

254
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,715
would really increase
our chances of survival.

255
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,592
It's like our sergeant told us
before one trip into the jungle.

256
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:10,728
<i>"Men!</i>

257
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,926
Fifty of you are leaving on a mission.
Twenty-five of ya ain't comin' back."

258
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,638
Okay.

259
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:23,668
<i>You know, the '68 Democratic Convention...</i>

260
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:26,267
<i>was probably the most bitchin'time
I ever had in my life.</i>

261
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:29,610
Hey, guys. One more thing. Hey. This summer...

262
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:33,742
when you're being inundated with all this
American bicentennial Fourth of July brouhaha...

263
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:36,151
don't forget what you're celebrating,
and that's the fact...

264
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:38,883
that a bunch of slave-owning
aristocratic white males...

265
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,925
didn't want to pay their taxes.

266
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,052
- Yeah!
- Have a good summer.

298
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,158
Okay. Open wide.

299
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:57,229
Open wide.

300
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:01,290
<i>- Open. Yeah.
- What do you think?</i>

301
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,800
<i>All right. We got 'em.</i>

302
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,064
Hey, you. Come here.

303
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:10,342
<i>You.</i>

304
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:13,570
- Who are you?
- Uh, nobody.

305
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,239
I mean, I wasn't in the truck.

306
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,816
- Are you a freshman?
- Yeah.

307
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,386
Well, are you in, or are you out?

308
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,682
- In.
- Let's go.

309
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:29,426
Come on! Let's go!

310
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:31,553
Go! Come on! Hurry up!

311
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,461
<i>Oh, man. We're screwed!</i>

312
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:36,091
- Pentico, lose them.
- I'm tryin', man!

313
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:38,693
<i>Whoo!</i>

314
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:42,069
- Let's go! Come on!
- Who you fuckin' with?

315
00:18:42,174 --> 00:18:45,371
- Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!
- Drive! Drive this piece of shit!

316
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:47,536
<i>Shut up, man. Here they come.</i>

317
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:53,449
<i>Fucking turn!</i>

318
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,952
Oh, shit!

319
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:05,561
<i>- Come on! Let's go! Whoo!</i>

320
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:08,132
Oh, shit! Here they come!

321
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:11,499
I think we really pissed them off, man.
Just drop me off at my house.

322
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,936
- Are you still with me?
- Yeah. I guess.

323
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,303
- This is my house.
- They're slowing down.

324
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:19,400
You get out and get 'em. You get out.

325
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,809
- Good luck, man. Be there tonight.
- All right.

326
00:19:23,882 --> 00:19:27,147
All right. I'll catch up
with you guys later. Go, go, go.

327
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:33,486
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, nice try, freshmen.

328
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:36,152
Tell you what.
Just for being such brave little kids...

329
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,628
I'm only gonna give each of ya
five licks, okay?

330
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:42,189
All right. Grab a pole then, kids. Let's get goin'.

331
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:44,826
I don't think so, creep.

332
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:46,928
Mom!

333
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,167
Carl, get in the house.
Get in the house!

334
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:55,035
And you …
Get the hell off my property.

335
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:59,709
Oh. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. I was just escorting
your fine young son home from school.

336
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:02,719
<i>There's… There were
some ruffians about, and l…</i>

337
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,688
Oh, and, uh, Mitch, Carl.

338
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,692
We'll be seeing each other again.

339
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:17,068
<i>Oh, that's it. I fuckin'saw that, you little
sack of shit. You two are fuckin'dead!</i>

340
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:20,195
You hear me? You're fuckin' dead!

341
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,897
Excuse me. Thank you.

342
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:27,972
All right, you little freshman bitches.

343
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:32,880
Air raid!

344
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:34,816
That was pathetic!

345
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,820
<i>You guys are crumbs!</i>

346
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:40,824
<i>Let's try it again! That means get up,
you lazy little bitches. Get up!</i>

347
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,826
<i>You heard her!</i>

348
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:46,022
Air raid!

349
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:50,227
That was horrible, you little slut girls.
You little freshman sluts. Get up!

350
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:54,067
<i>Get up! Up! Up! Up!</i>

351
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,937
Air raid!

352
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,010
What's fascinating is the way
not only the school...

353
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:02,171
but the entire community seems to be
supporting this … or at least turn their heads.

354
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:04,579
- They apparently have permission to use the parking lot.
- Right.

355
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:07,151
No parents seem to mind. You know.
They're selling concessions.

356
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:08,719
- I mean …
- I know.

357
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:12,222
The seniors, we tried.
We …We gave you all a chance.

358
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:17,352
But since you little prick-teases
can't follow instructions...

359
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:20,432
we're just gonna have to try
something else, won't we?

360
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:22,693
Seniors …

361
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:25,531
You love us. Smile.
You love us.

It's horrible.

387
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:54,151
Aha!

388
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:56,727
I just want you guys to know
I feel for you, man.

389
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:00,026
I did it when I was a freshman,
and you'll do it when you're a senior.

390
00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:03,829
But you're doing great. Now fry like bacon,
you little freshman piggies!

Um, what'll you do for me, huh?

Um, anything you want.

400
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:34,065
- Imagine the possibilities.
- Oh, Jesus.

401
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,066
No, seriously, you can stand up.

402
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:38,227

- Sabrina.

403
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:39,736

- Hi.

404
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:42,500
- Anthony actually.
- Sorry.

405

- This is Mike.
- Hey.

406
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,704
We were just discussing the utter
stupidity of these initiation rituals...

407
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:50,509
and we were …we're kind of wondering
why someone like you...

408
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:52,948
would subject yourself
to the losing end of it all.

409
00:23:53,051 --> 00:23:55,019
What are we having?
Social hour over here?

410
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,884
I'm supposed to be being a bitch.
Back to the pit.

411
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,753
<i>All right, kiddo.</i>

412
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:02,691
- It's almost over. Don't worry about it.
- So, uh, am I mistaken...

413
00:24:02,794 --> 00:24:05,592
or was there a little unspoken thing
going on with that young vixen?

414
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:07,597
- You stud.
- You know how it is.

415
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:10,249
I bet she's pretty cute once
you clean all the shit off her.

416
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:10,896
I bet she is.

417
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:15,633
Okay, girlies! It's hot out here,
and I'm really sick of looking at all of you.

418
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,107
So let's just … Let's get out of here.

419
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,169
What are you looking at?
Wipe that face off your head, bitch.

420
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:24,647
Let's go! Get in the truck!

421
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,718
Get in the truck! Come on!

422
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:29,082
You know, maybe if you ever
left the poker table …

423
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:31,382
<i>Maybe if I ever left the poker table?
What about you?</i>

424
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,653
Whatever. I mean, the point is, that's why
we're going out tonight. You know?

425
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,159
Who knows? You might
experience something a little...

426
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:38,821
more tangible than an
Abraham Lincoln dream.

427
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:41,890
- That's, like, a hairline fracture right there.
- Shit.

428
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,264
- What's that about? What'd you do?
- I wouldn't doubt it.

429
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,530
My boy Benny
was wearing their asses out, boy!

430
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:50,768
- Shit.
- I just gave him a little beating he'll never forget.

431
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,844
Here's to ya, Ma.

432

433
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:59,480
Say, man. Fuck the coaches, man.
Just do it for us, man.

434
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,553
- You picked this thing up?
- Yeah. You know.

435
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:03,712
Hey. What are you doin'?

436
00:25:03,822 --> 00:25:05,722
- He ain't doin' shit now.
- What?

437
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:09,419
Got any more details of my life you got
figured out you can let me in on, Ben?

438
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,996
Lots of details.

439
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:14,998

- What's happening?

440
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,068
Oh, you didn't hear, did you?

441
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:19,433
- What?
- Didn't hear I got a shotgun pulled on my ass?

442
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:21,438
- No way!
- Swear to God.

Hi, guys. You here to see Kevin?

452
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:58,705
- No. Actually, we came here to see you.
- Oh.

453
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,211
- Bet you're glad school's out, aren't you?
- Yeah. We got our report cards today.

454
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:04,646

- Straight A's.

455
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,843
- Both of you?
- Yeah.

456
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:09,216
- Big trip, huh?
- We're going away for the weekend.

457
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:12,051
- Oh, you're taking Kev with ya, huh?
- No. He's staying here.

458
00:26:12,157 --> 00:26:14,057
Oh. Oh, he is. Oh.

459
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,753
- Thanks.
- Go on in. He's up there somewhere.

460
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:26,704
- Let's get together sometime. All right?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

461
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:28,705
- All right.
- Be lots of fun.

462
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:30,798
- Yeah.
- What do you do? I mean, for fun.

463
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:34,504
Usually just hang out with the girls.
You know, drive around. That kind of stuff.

464
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:37,013
There's a big party tonight.
It should be really great.

465
00:26:37,115 --> 00:26:39,083
- Oh.
- So …

466
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:42,018
- Do you want to come?
- Yeah.

467
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,020
- Yeah?
- Yeah. That'd be fun.

468
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:46,022
- Cool. Think it'll be all right?
- It'll be fine.

469
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,319
- Great. We'll pick you up at about 8:30.
- Okay. Cool.

470
00:26:48,427 --> 00:26:50,327
- See you then.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

471
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,454
Bye.

472
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:55,158
All right. Let's go.
We gotta get ready.

473
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:06,611
Sample of the goods.

474
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,648
Fifteen bucks.

475
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:16,219
Can you spot me 10?

476
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:18,915
I'll pay you, like, Tuesday and shit.

477
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:25,395
Thank you.

478
00:27:25,497 --> 00:27:27,624
"Shebanga."
Who is it?

479
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:31,294
<i>- Kevin, I think you need to come out here a minute.
- Hide the shit.</i>

480
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,167
- Oh, man. It reeks in here.
- Shit.

481
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,467
<i>Slater, get up.</i>

482
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:40,102
<i> Kevin, there's someone
out here who says he needs to talk to you.</i>

483
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:42,112
Here. What about?

484
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:44,739
Go get the door man. Here.

485
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,011
<i>- Slater, lose it.
- Kevin, open the door.</i>

486
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,485
<i>- Quick!
- Lose it, man. Damn.</i>

487
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,088
<i>Hey, Dad, Ma. What's up?</i>

488
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:56,956
- Did you order some kegs of beer?
- No.

489
00:27:57,062 --> 00:28:00,327
Well, there's a fella in a beer truck
out on the street that says you did.

490
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,161
<i>- Oh, really?
- Yeah.</i>

491
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:04,667
<i>Just a sec.</i>

492
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,674
<i>Shit.</i>

493
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:14,868
- That guy said I ordered a keg of beer?
- Yeah.

494
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,744
He said it was to be delivered
to the Pickford residence.

495
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:19,908
- This address?
- This address.

496
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:23,818
That's kind of funny.
Why don't I go out there and see what's goin' on?

497
00:28:23,922 --> 00:28:25,890
Yeah. I think you better.

498
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,459
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

499
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,653
You guys know anything
about a party here tonight?

500
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:35,228
- No, sir.
- No.

501
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:42,365
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

502
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:44,567
Hey, man.

503
00:28:44,676 --> 00:28:46,735
- Aren't you a little bit early?
- Uh …

504
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,679
Yeah. About an hour and a half.

505
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,249
But, see, I wanted to get here early,
see if anyone's here.

506
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,930
I got this little action happening
tonight, man, if you know what I mean.

507
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:57,720
So I guess you got the wrong house.

508
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:01,324
Oh.

509
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:05,886
Yeah. Inconvenience for you. I'm sorry.
Uh, wrong Mr. Pickford all together.

510
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:08,591
Hey. These things happen.
Don't worry about it, Ben.

511
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,668
Yeah.

512
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:15,837
Were you going to have a party
here tonight, Son?

513
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:18,273
I don't know what that was all about.

514
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:21,539
Start unpacking.
We're not goin' anywhere.

515

Let's just get this last guy out, okay?

541
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:52,862

- Hey, Kramer!

544

Quit stallin'! Let's go, baby!
We're waiting for you!

I hope you got more than a jockstrap
under there, you little rat!

546
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,608

don't let it affect your concentration.

Could you do the rest of us a favor
and leave through the gate in right field?

550
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:15,285
That'll draw them all out of here.

895
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:19,514
My man, what is happenin'?

896
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,982
Long time no see.

<i>- What have you been up to?
- Same old shit, man.</i>

898

- Workin' for the city.
- Workin' man, huh?

899
00:53:27,557 --> 00:53:30,390
Been thinkin' about gettin'
back in school though, man.

900

But on the other hand, man,
I'd just as soon keep workin'.

903
00:53:39,436 --> 00:53:42,337
- Keep a little change in my pocket.
- Yeah? Wait.

904
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:46,341
Rather than spend my time listenin' to some dipshit

I know what you're talkin' about.

906
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,580
- Say, you're a freshman, right?
- Yeah.

907
00:53:52,683 --> 00:53:55,584
All right, so tell me, man.
How's this year's crop of freshman chicks lookin'?

908
00:53:57,688 --> 00:54:01,089
Wood, you're gonna end up in jail
sometime really soon. I know that for a fact.

909
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:03,591
No, man.
No, let me tell you.

910
00:54:03,694 --> 00:54:07,960
That's what I love about
these high school girls, man.

911
00:54:08,065 --> 00:54:10,863
I get older, they stay the same age.

912
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:12,867
Yes, they do.

913
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,869
Yes, they do.

914
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:18,338

- Shotgun!

Yeah. Why not?

1194
01:09:56,812 --> 01:09:58,939
Hey, man. Hey. Slow down. What's up?

1195
01:09:59,048 --> 01:10:01,516
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- What'd you just say?

1196
01:10:01,617 --> 01:10:03,175
When?

1197
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:06,778
Just now, man, when you walked past.
What'd you say?

1198
01:10:06,889 --> 01:10:08,379
A- About what?

1199
01:10:09,492 --> 01:10:12,017
You said,
"Someone's tokin' some reefer."

1200
01:10:12,128 --> 01:10:15,120
No, I may have said something
about smelling some pot.

1201
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:17,961
- You know, it was just an observation.
- Oh, an observation, huh?

1202
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:21,059
Well, who the hell are you, man?
Isaac fuckin' Newton?

1203
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:24,037
<i>Well, guess what, genius.
I'm the one smoking marijuana, motherfucker.</i>

1204
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,404
- You got a problem with that?
- No. Of course not.

1205
01:10:26,509 --> 01:10:31,310
Then why'd you say that, chief? Don't let
your mouth write a check your butt can't cash.

1206
01:10:31,414 --> 01:10:33,848

So I'm a fuckin' pothead, man.

1207
01:10:33,949 --> 01:10:37,350
What's it to you? Huh?
What's the matter, pussy? Out of observations?

1208
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:40,650
Why don't you observe while I punch
your teeth down your fuckin' throat!

1209
01:10:40,756 --> 01:10:43,657
Dude, relax! Relax!
He's cool, man. Relax.

1210
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:47,251
Hey, I'll be watching you, Newton.
I only came here to do two things, man.

1211
01:10:47,363 --> 01:10:49,797
Kick some ass and drink some beer.

1212
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:53,357
Looks like we're almost out of beer.

1213
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:56,700
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

1214
01:11:01,844 --> 01:11:04,244
<i>Why is it called the moon tower, anyway?</i>

1215
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:09,717
Uh, I guess they decided to put it up out here
whenever they were building the power plant.

1216
01:11:09,819 --> 01:11:11,719
Actually, it's a good idea.

1217
01:11:11,821 --> 01:11:15,222
You got a full moon out here
every day of the year. You know?

1218
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:17,224
Yeah, but nothing's ever been repaired...

1219
01:11:17,326 --> 01:11:20,227
so this whole place
could fall down at any time.

1220
01:11:20,329 --> 01:11:22,490
So you'd better
watch your step, junior.

1221
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,900
This place used to be off limits, man,
'cause of some drunk freshman who fell off.

1222
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:32,735
He went right down the middle,
smackin' his head on every beam, man.

1223
01:11:32,842 --> 01:11:35,470
I hear it doesn't hurt
after the first couple, though.

1224
01:11:35,578 --> 01:11:38,809
<i>Autopsy said he had one beer, man.
How many did you have?</i>

1225
01:11:38,914 --> 01:11:40,814
Four.

1226
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,816
You're dead, man.
You're so dead.

1227
01:11:42,918 --> 01:11:46,081
Look at the bloodstains right there.

1228
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:48,156
Shut up.

1229
01:11:49,191 --> 01:11:52,058
I'm gonna get that guy.

1230
01:11:52,161 --> 01:11:55,460
- What guy?
- That asshole on the way in … Clint.

1231
01:11:55,564 --> 01:11:58,965
Super-dominant male
in a '50s greaser uniform.

1232
01:11:59,068 --> 01:12:00,968
I wouldn't suggest that, Mike.

1233
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:02,970
Look, man, I got it all planned out.

1234
01:12:03,072 --> 01:12:05,973
Most fights in places like this never get past
a punch or two before they're broken up.

1235
01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:08,976
There's almost a natural instinct
not to upset the herd.

1236
01:12:09,078 --> 01:12:11,979
So all I gotta do is get in one good punch,
play defense and wait.

1237
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:14,982
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1238
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:17,985
I- I-I guess at first I was relieved
to get out of the situation...

1239
01:12:18,087 --> 01:12:20,487
but now there's this level
of humiliation setting in...

1240
01:12:20,589 --> 01:12:22,989
that I can tell is gonna
be with me for-fucking-ever!

1241
01:12:23,092 --> 01:12:25,492
I'm just not gonna let this be
yet another situation...

1242
01:12:25,594 --> 01:12:28,688
which contributes to me being a little,
ineffectual nothing the rest of my life.

1243
01:12:31,967 --> 01:12:34,868

1245
01:12:39,742 --> 01:12:43,109

out there right now are fucking, man.

1246
01:12:45,214 --> 01:12:47,114

Wait a minute.

1342
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,100
Who put the keg way out here
in the woods?

1343
01:18:07,202 --> 01:18:10,103
I don't know. This is just
where they told me it would be.

1344
01:18:10,205 --> 01:18:12,605
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1345
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:15,176
- Huh.
- I don't think we need beer anyway.

1346
01:18:17,913 --> 01:18:20,711
- George toked weed, man?
- Absolutely, George toked weed.

1347
01:18:20,816 --> 01:18:23,717
Are you kidding me, man?
He grew fields of that stuff.

1348
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:25,719
That's what I'm talking about.
Fields!

1349
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:29,780
- He grew that shit up at Mount Vernon, man.
- Mount Vernon? He grew it all over the country.

1350
01:18:29,892 --> 01:18:32,793
<i>He had people growin'it
all over the country.</i>

1351
01:18:32,895 --> 01:18:35,796
<i>The whole country back then was gettin'high.
Let me tell you, man.</i>

1352
01:18:35,898 --> 01:18:38,526
<i>'Cause… 'Cause… 'Cause he knew.
He was onto somethin', man.</i>

1353
01:18:38,634 --> 01:18:42,866
He knew that it would be a good
cash crop for the Southern states, man...

1354
01:18:42,971 --> 01:18:44,871
so he grew fields of it, man.

1355
01:18:44,973 --> 01:18:49,000
But you know what?
Behind every good man there's a woman.

1356
01:18:49,111 --> 01:18:51,011
And that woman
was Martha Washington, man.

1357
01:18:51,113 --> 01:18:55,015
And every day, George would come home,
she'd have a big, fat bowl waiting for him...

1358
01:18:55,117 --> 01:18:57,017
when he'd come in the door, man.

1359
01:18:57,119 --> 01:18:59,144
She was a hip … a hip, hip lady, man.

1360
01:19:12,267 --> 01:19:15,065
Mm-mmm.
Wait a minute.

1361
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:17,070
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1362
01:19:17,172 --> 01:19:19,402
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

1363
01:19:19,508 --> 01:19:21,476
Don't you have a girlfriend?

1364
01:19:24,046 --> 01:19:27,311
- What girlfriend?
- What's-her-name.

1365
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:30,852
Simone. Hmm?

1366
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:37,290
And she was real cool too.

1367
01:19:37,392 --> 01:19:40,293
She'd harvest the crops, man.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1368
01:19:40,395 --> 01:19:43,296
She'd put it in the … in the, um, bushels
and stuff and sell it, you know.

1369
01:19:43,398 --> 01:19:46,299
Because they had to
make ends meet and stuff.

1370
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:48,801
I mean, did you ever look
at a dollar bill, man?

1371
01:19:48,904 --> 01:19:53,034
There's some spooky stuff going on
on a dollar bill, man. And it's green too!

1372
01:19:53,141 --> 01:19:55,041
- Later.
- See ya.

1373
01:19:55,143 --> 01:19:58,044
<i>- Cool.
- Wait, wait, wait. What was that all about?</i>

1374
01:19:58,146 --> 01:20:01,115
- What were you doin' back there, guy?
- Exactly what you two clowns wish you were doin'.

1375
01:20:01,216 --> 01:20:03,116
- Look at him.
- Look at your boy.

1376

1379

<i>- Freshman! Over here right now.

- Shit. I'll be back.

1383
01:20:25,207 --> 01:20:27,175
Okay.

1384
01:20:27,276 --> 01:20:29,676

- Yeah.

1385
01:20:29,778 --> 01:20:32,178
- It's amazing.
- Look at this shit-eating grin on his face.

1386
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:34,681
- Was I right?
- Not bad for a little freshman.

1387
01:20:34,783 --> 01:20:37,183
But you better watch out
for them older girls.

1388
01:20:37,286 --> 01:20:39,186
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here, come here, come here.

1389
01:20:39,288 --> 01:20:42,485
All right, all right.
We just wanna know something. Okay?

1390
01:20:42,591 --> 01:20:46,493
Are you gonna be fuckin' that later,
or are you gonna be a little wimp? Huh?

1391
01:20:46,595 --> 01:20:49,496
How do you know I haven't already?

1392
01:20:49,598 --> 01:20:52,499
Get outta here!
I think it's past your bedtime!

1393
01:20:52,601 --> 01:20:55,502
- Run along.
- Come here. Come here, come here.

1394
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:59,506
Why don't you go get a ride with her.
Say we left you.

1395
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:02,236
It'll work. It'll work. Go.

1396
01:21:02,344 --> 01:21:04,972
- Hey, Kramer. Show it to her.
- Yeah.

1397
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,207
- Give it to her. Go!
- Go, boy.

1398
01:21:15,223 --> 01:21:17,123
Air raid, freshman.

1399
01:21:17,225 --> 01:21:19,125
What?

1400
01:21:19,227 --> 01:21:21,286
Air raid, freshman.

1401
01:21:21,396 --> 01:21:24,388
- Oh, come on, Darla. Leave her alone.
- No, Tony, this is between me and her.

1402
01:21:24,499 --> 01:21:27,730
And she'd better be on the ground
i- in five seconds.

<i>Wait, she doesn't have to air-raid
because she's with me. Okay?</i>

1404

Air-raid, or it's your ass.

Don't air-raid for that bitch.
I hate that shit.

1413

Hey, little brother.

- Why, yes, it is.

Have you had more
than one of those tonight?

- Hi.

1442

Guess I might as well just get used to you
being at the same social functions as me, huh?

1443
01:24:07,362 --> 01:24:09,762
And, uh, hanging out
with people I know?

supposed to be home, anyway?

Oh, geez, I don't know.
Couple hours ago.

1481
01:26:08,883 --> 01:26:13,582
On the 50-fuckin'- yard line,
in honor of your daddy, Coach Conrad.

1482
01:26:13,688 --> 01:26:16,316
We're there! Great idea!

1483
01:26:16,424 --> 01:26:18,915
- The man with the plan.
- Wanna come with me?

1484
01:26:19,027 --> 01:26:20,927
Okay.

1485
01:26:21,029 --> 01:26:22,929
Hey.

1486
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:26,467
Joint subcommittee meeting
on the 50 yard line in 15. You there?

1487
01:26:26,568 --> 01:26:28,593
<i>- Okay.
- Don, y'all ride with me, man.</i>

1488
01:26:28,703 --> 01:26:30,603
<i>Let's hit it.</i>

1489
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:32,832
- This is cashed, man.
- It's in there, man.

1490
01:26:32,941 --> 01:26:36,035
You can ride with us, man, but you're
ridin' in the back, 'cause I got shotgun.

1491
01:26:36,144 --> 01:26:38,271
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- H-Hey!

1492
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:41,747
Hey, hey, hey! Watch the leather, man!

1493
01:26:43,918 --> 01:26:45,818
Oh, fuck it!

1494
01:26:48,056 --> 01:26:51,890
<i>- Don't you quit! Do you wanna hit him?
- He was wide open!</i>

1495
01:26:51,993 --> 01:26:55,485
<i>- Do you want to hit him?
- Jesus, son! You're wearing Rebel gray!</i>

1496
01:26:55,597 --> 01:26:57,997
- Now, break down! Break down!
- I'm sorry, Coach.

1497
01:26:58,099 --> 01:27:00,659
I want you on him like stink on shit!
I say, stink on shit!

1498
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:03,829
Break down! You don't deserve
to wear that Rebel gray, boy!

1499
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:07,533
You don't deserve to wear it!
You won't hit him? You won't hit him?

1500
01:27:07,642 --> 01:27:10,202
O.T.S.S!
Only the strong survive!

1501
01:27:10,312 --> 01:27:12,212
- Only the strong survive!
- Only the strong survive, boy!

1502
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:14,544
- Only the strong survive!
- That's it!

1503
01:27:14,649 --> 01:27:17,550
Now, where's your pitch man?
Hit your goddamn pitch man!

1504
01:27:21,823 --> 01:27:23,882
He fumbles!

1505
01:27:23,992 --> 01:27:26,893
Hey, man!

1506
01:27:26,995 --> 01:27:29,896
Hell, my grandmother
can hit harder than that!

1507
01:27:29,998 --> 01:27:32,398
What the fuck, man?

1508
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,401
Course, she's an 8 foot 4,
652-pound, hairy-ass gorilla...

1509
01:27:35,503 --> 01:27:37,596
drives a Mack truck
and runs the 40 in 10.2.

1510
01:27:37,706 --> 01:27:42,336
Hell, she's gotten bigger lately, man.
She was only 6'2", 195 in my day.

1511
01:27:42,444 --> 01:27:44,412
<i>Still drives that Mack truck though.</i>

1512
01:27:44,512 --> 01:27:46,537
Hey, Pink,
you got my papers, man?

1513
01:27:46,648 --> 01:27:49,014
Uh, yeah, there's some
in my glove compartment.

1514
01:27:49,117 --> 01:27:52,780
I got 'em. Hit me on a slant.
Give me the keys to an inside.

1515
01:27:52,887 --> 01:27:54,787
Hut. Down!

1516
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:57,653
Marijuana on one!

1517
01:27:57,759 --> 01:27:59,659
Reefer on two!

1518
01:27:59,761 --> 01:28:02,662
Hut! Hut!

1519
01:28:02,764 --> 01:28:05,562
<i>- Wide open!</i>

1520
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,294
I got it! Sweet!

1521
01:28:07,402 --> 01:28:10,769
Oh!

1522
01:28:10,872 --> 01:28:12,772
<i>That's pretty good.</i>

1523
01:28:12,874 --> 01:28:14,774
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

1524
01:28:14,876 --> 01:28:18,437
Could be, like, a little … I don't know.
Maybe perhaps a little more symmetrical.

1525
01:28:18,546 --> 01:28:20,446
- Does that hurt?
- Oww!

1526
01:28:20,548 --> 01:28:22,448
- Yes! PI … It …
- Sorry. Sorry.

1527
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,450
- It's a bruise.
- Okay.

1528
01:28:24,552 --> 01:28:26,952
I don't know.
Let me ask you something, though.

1529
01:28:27,055 --> 01:28:29,615
I mean, I got some
pretty good ones in there.

1530
01:28:29,724 --> 01:28:32,750
I mean, it's not like I …
You wouldn't say I got my ass kicked, right?

1531
01:28:32,861 --> 01:28:34,761
Oh, no. You know …
I don't know.

1532
01:28:34,863 --> 01:28:38,424
After a couple years, people won't even
remember, really, who won or lost.

1533
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:40,433
Yeah … No, you're right.

1534
01:28:40,535 --> 01:28:43,436
You read about, like, Jackson Pollock
or Ernest Hemingway…

1535
01:28:43,538 --> 01:28:45,938
You never read about who won or lost,
just, they got into a brawl.

1536
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,940
Right. Exactly.

1537
01:28:48,042 --> 01:28:50,943
Well, uh, thanks for the ride
and breakfast and everything.

1538
01:28:51,045 --> 01:28:52,945
No problem.

1539
01:28:53,047 --> 01:28:57,416
Sure is nice to pile on some pancakes and syrup
after a night of beer drinking, isn't it?

1540
01:29:00,722 --> 01:29:02,349
Um …

1541
01:29:11,733 --> 01:29:14,031
Good night.

1542
01:29:26,681 --> 01:29:28,649
Good night.

1543

I don't know. I'll probably end up signing it.
I just don't wanna give in so easy.

Man, it's the same bullshit
they tried to pull in my day.

Man, if you're gonna

Yeah, they're all assholes. But think about it.
We've had a lot of good times right here, Pink.

<i> Yeah, I mean, come on, Pink.
I can't believe this.</i>

You act like you're so oppressed.
Man, you guys are kings of the school.

1562

You get away with whatever you want.
What are you bitching about?

1563

to these as the best years of my life...

Come here.

How can you even pretend
to talk that way? Huh?

1613
01:33:38,066 --> 01:33:42,298
Okay, Randy, I shouldn't do this, but I'm willing

1614

01:34:33,588 --> 01:34:35,488
<i>Let's rock and roll.</i>

1626
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:39,651
All right, man! Livin'!

1627
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:43,094
Shit, I'm gettin' my third wind.
Let's get on the road.

1628
01:34:43,197 --> 01:34:46,098
- Let's go. You gonna come, man?
- Shotgun!

1629
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,100
Talk to you later, then.

1630
01:34:48,202 --> 01:34:51,296
- You guys not goin'?
- Can I use your keys?

1631
01:34:51,405 --> 01:34:53,669
- Yeah.
- Time to boogie on outta here.

1632
01:34:53,775 --> 01:34:55,675
- Hey.
- Let's do it.

1633
01:34:55,777 --> 01:34:57,745
So that's that, huh?

1634
01:34:59,947 --> 01:35:01,847
All right.

1635
01:35:01,949 --> 01:35:04,315
Slate. Aah!

1636
01:35:04,418 --> 01:35:06,386
I never get shotgun.

1637
01:35:21,402 --> 01:35:23,734
Uh, hi, Mom.

1638
01:35:23,838 --> 01:35:26,602
Mmm, okay, Mitchell.

1639
01:35:27,809 --> 01:35:30,710
This is your one
get-out-of-jail-free card...

1640
01:35:30,812 --> 01:35:32,712
so I hope you enjoyed it.

1641
01:35:32,814 --> 01:35:34,714
No.

1642
01:35:34,816 --> 01:35:38,343
Your sister told me everything,
so I've decided to make this deal with you.

1643
01:35:38,452 --> 01:35:42,252
I'm … I'm gonna be open-minded
about it this time.

1644
01:35:42,356 --> 01:35:46,417
But... next time
you come in at sunrise...

1645
01:35:46,527 --> 01:35:48,495
we've got problems.

1646
01:35:56,804 --> 01:36:00,604
And, uh, who is this older girl
who gave you a ride?

1647
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,767
She's just, like …

1648
01:36:02,877 --> 01:36:05,209
Have you been drinking?

1649
01:36:05,313 --> 01:36:07,247
No!

1650
01:36:07,348 --> 01:36:09,077
Are you drunk?
