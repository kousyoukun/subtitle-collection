[Dan] And you, buddy. Thank you.

158
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,928
[sighs]

159
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,723
Girls, I'm gonna help Trina with her bags.

160
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,726
- I want you to go on in without me.
- It's one bag. I got it, honey.

161
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,496
- Let me help you with the bags.
- [chuckles]

162
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,896
- Bye, Tri.
- [Trina] Bye, ladies.

163
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:42,897
Bye, Tri.

164
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,482
- See you in a bit.
- Get some rest.

165
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,735
[Trina] Impressed with you getting those.

166
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,821
[Peter] Hi, Covey!

167
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,740
[girls] Peter!

168
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,242
[laughs]

169
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,701
Oh. [grunts]

170
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,954
[laughs] I missed you too, kiddo.

171
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,081
Especially when I made that sign.

172
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:04,585
Hmm. Your spatial planning could use work,
but I appreciate the glitter.

173
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,669
[laughs]

174
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,548
She approves of the glitter.

175
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,221
- Mmm.

176
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,349

- I missed you more.

00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

178
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,104
- Mm.

179
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,021

185
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,203
No, no! Truce or else
you don't get your last present.

186
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,746
Yes!

187
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,584
- [grunts]
- [laughs]

188
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,639
I got it at Seoul Tower,
so someday we can go back and put it on.

189
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,392
I love it.

190
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,394
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,523
[Kitty] Ew.

192
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,067
Aren't you supposed to make out
after the movie's started?

193
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,068
Not with Lara Jean.

194
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,154
She doesn't even let me talk
once the movie starts.

195
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,990
It's because I want you
to actually watch it.

196
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,743
And it's my turn tonight,
and we are doing Say Anything.

197
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,847
There's this great scene with John Cusack,
and he sits underneath the window.

198
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,373
- He holds up a boombox...
- Okay. That's awesome. We get it.

199
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,501
So, I have
a very important question for you, Peter.

200
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,421
What is the best text
you've ever gotten from a girl?

201
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,381
I'm… I'm sorry, what?

202
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,465
Kitty met a boy.

203
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,092
- Kit... What?
- Mm-hmm!

204
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,387
- He's from Korea.
- What is his name?

205
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,807
Dae. And this is the first time
I'm contacting him.

206
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,077
- So it has to be memorable.
- Dunno why you're asking me.

207
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,538
You should talk to Lara Jean.
She's the queen of love letters.

208
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,814
Yeah. I said "memorable," not "cheesy."

209
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,898
[groans]

210
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,734
Ow! [chuckles]

211
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,862
Okay, okay, okay.
I promise to coach you on your game

212
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,740
if you promise to teach me
how to braid Lara Jean's hair.

213
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,701
Okay, but you're never going to master
the French, Kavinsky.

214
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,953
Oh, I mastered the French.

215
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,872
You guys are disgusting.

216
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,873
[both] Oh, yeah.

217
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,667
Because we're good at kissing.

218
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750
[giggles]

219
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,586
[both grunt softly]

220
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,589
- Kitty met a boy.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,715
That's insane.

222
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,593
They met at the love locks.
Such a good meet-cute.

223
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,514
- What's a meet-cute?
- Have you learned nothing from rom-coms?

224
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,518
Always make grand gestures.
It's okay to interrupt a wedding…

225
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,398
A meet-cute
is when a couple meets for the first time.

226
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,984
It's always cute, and that is how you know
they're gonna end up together.

227
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,903
I wish we had a meet-cute.

228
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,992
Well, you jumped my bones
at the high school track.

229
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,369
That was pretty cute.

230
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,370
[chuckles]

231
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,914
That doesn't count
'cause we already knew each other.

232
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,126
We don't have a song,
we don't have an anniversary,

233
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,753
and we can't remember how we met.

234
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,714
We are a terrible rom-com couple.

235
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,257
I remember when we met.

236
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,342
- You do not.
- Yeah, I do.

237
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,594
You don't remember when we... when we met?

- I am offended right now.
- [laughs]

239
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,120
- Okay, so tell me, how did we meet?
- No! You don't deserve to know.

240
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,478

Ah, it was nothing. It was just my dad.

248
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,924
I guess he heard about Stanford
and wants to take me out to celebrate.

00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,301
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

- That's huge, Peter. Are you gonna do it?

00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,514
Nah.

252
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,057
Maybe he's proud of you.

253
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,853
Maybe.
He doesn't really get to be, though.

254
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,480
He had nothing to do with it.

- Hmm?

What if I didn't?

265

Then my dad would kill you.

266
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,384
- No, he wouldn't.
- Hmm.

267
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:27,264
But he'd give you his disappointed face,
which somehow is much worse.

[Lara Jean] In movies,
love is always about the big moments.

276
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,600
Grand speeches made in front of everyone,
"marry me" written on the Jumbotron.

277
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,729
But maybe love
is actually about the moments

278
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,815
when you think no one is watching.

No, and it's killing me.

[sighs] Berkeley and UCLA

289
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,678
and NYU,
but I only applied there for Margot.

290

How was your day?

931
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,743
It's better now. I missed you.
Come on. Let's go to my room.

932
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,288
I missed you too.
Did you get the video I sent you?

933
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:59,209
Yeah, I did. It was, you know...
Cool song, but I wasn't there for it.

934
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,839
So, I feel like I should be there
for the song that we make ours.

935
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,967
Yeah, but it was that moment. I felt it.

936
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,606
Well, we can always come back to it
if we don't find something else.

I didn't expect to feel so surprised.

She practically lives here anyway.

942

943
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,510
[Margot]
It is weird. Mom is all over that house,

944
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,138
and now it feels like she's being erased.

945

I mean, are you upset
they're getting married?

946
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,853
No, I just never pictured it.

947
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,687
But…

948
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,278
it's kind of nice, right?

I'm sorry for the stuff I said
about you leaving.

955
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,046
It's okay. I shouldn't have
pushed you about New York.

956
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,676
No, you were right. I totally loved it.

957
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,761
You did?

958
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,515
Yeah, I mean,
I thought that I was gonna hate it

959
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,101
or I thought
that I would feel overwhelmed,

960
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,772
but I could really see myself
living there, you know?

961
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,108
I get why so many books are set there.

Everywhere you look, there's a story.

963

And NYU has this amazing lit program

964
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,031
where they invite real authors
to come speak to their students.

965
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,909
And I could even intern
at a publishing house.

966
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,870
So, it just, um… doesn't really matter

967
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,748
'cause I'm not sure that...
I don't even think I got in, so…

LJ, college is about more
than just geography.

969
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,253
I know that.

970
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,132
But Berkeley is a great school,

971
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,801
and if I keep my grades up,
I can transfer to Stanford.

972
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,471
Now that Peter and I have a new plan,
everything could go back to normal.

00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,435
Just make sure that's what you want.

Okay. Well, there's nothing fast
or furious about go-karts.

I'm planning a date,
and it has to be fun and normal.

990
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:09,691
And you think teaching Peter Kavinsky
to make soap is normal?

991
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,528
Maybe I should just give him
all three options and have him choose.

992
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,908
But not soap-making?

Absolutely not.

You got into NYU. Are you kidding me?

Good for you, honey.

We're going to be able to meet
in San Francisco on the weekends

and explore the city.

We never could have done that

we gotta go to Tartine Bakery

I'm coming over every weekend,
and we are gonna go dancing

and have a good time.

I'm guessing he didn't take it that well.

Uh, no, he did,
which somehow felt much worse.

1218

You are going to figure it out. Okay?

1219
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,328
You're totally relationship goals.

1220
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:27,168
If there's anybody that can do
long distance, it's you and him.

1221

[Lara Jean] Hey.

What's up?

1223
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:43,267
Make it memorable, romantic,
and no quotes from famous dead poets.

1224
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:47,480
Covey, yearbooks are for people
you're never gonna see again.

1225
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,190
That's not true.

1226
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:52,359
They're for remembering where you were
in this exact moment in your life.

1227
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:58,324
So, you're saying that
you're gonna need help to remember me?

- No, that's not...
- Hey.

1229

If it's important to you,
I will absolutely sign it,

Well, you already got one of those.
