1
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,296
Dear Peter.

2
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,673
Hello from Seoul.

3
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,100
By the time you get this,
I'll probably already be home.

4
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,352
But I couldn't leave without writing you.

5
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,439
You always tease me
for being such a homebody.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,693
But I think
you'd be proud if you saw me here.

7
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,653
-Kimchi!
-Kimchi!

8
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,284
Everything my mom told me is true.

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,413
Korea is beyond anything
I could've imagined.

10
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,042
We've been running around nonstop,

11
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,668
trying to see and do

12
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,838
and eat all the things
before spring break is over.

13
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,382
We're having an amazing time together.

14
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,677
Although, my dad might be having
the best trip of any of us.

15
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,056
Hey, girls, I think
I want to ask Trina to marry me.

16
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,516
Oh, my God, Dad!

17
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,311
This was all part of my master plan,
so boom, you're welcome!

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,565
But the best part
is spending time with my sisters.

19
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,067
We got it. We got it.

20
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,277
♪ I'm so fancy ♪

21
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,072
♪ Can't you taste this gold? ♪

22
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,658
♪ Remember my name ♪

23
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,369
♪ 'Bout to blow ♪

24
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:06,751
Ooh!

25
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,467
You know, the truth is,
I've barely had any time to miss you.

26
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,554
Just kidding.
I miss you like crazy.

27
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,556
Fingers crossed, I get into Stanford,

28
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,267
and we never have to be
this far apart again.

29
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,145
I love you, Peter. Always and forever.

30
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,646
-Like a lingering fart.

31
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,898
Or nay, a bruise that never heals.

32
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,191
-Kitty.

33
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,236
I'm just saying,
this is a little dramatic, even for you.

34
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,905
Oh, my goodness.
Look at these cupcakes!

35
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,741
I miss him! With the time difference,
I barely talk to him all week.

36
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,286
Oh, my God. The horror!

37
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,371
Is it just me,
or is she getting meaner with age?

38
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,290
-And more opinionated.
-Thank you.

39
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,793
Okay, all I know is I'm glad you guys
are both going to Stanford next year

40
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,254
because you are not cut out
for this long-distance thing.

41
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,548
Okay. Well, don't jinx it.
I haven't gotten in yet.

42
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,383
Maybe you should wait until you hear back

43
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,510
from all of your colleges
before you make a decision.

44
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,346
Well, Peter's going for lacrosse.
It's a great school, and it's perfect.

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,347
Okay.

46
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,496
Hey, Covey.

47
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,165
Hi!

48
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,292
-Did you get the photos I sent you?
-I did.

49
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,960
Uh… but I didn't open them.

50
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,214
It's bad luck to see campus
before you get in.

51
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,507
It's not a wedding, Covey.
You're not marrying Stanford.

52
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,886
Can't be too careful.
So, how was the visit?

53
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:45,058
Amazing. It's… This campus is huge,
and just wait until you see the library.

54
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,851
You went to the library for me?

55
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,812
Hey, you know, sometimes I read books
that don't have pictures, Covey.

56
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,314
The lacrosse team is tough, though.

57
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,483
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to start in the fall.

58
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,819
Well, you wouldn't have gotten
a scholarship if you weren't good enough.

59
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,698
-College is not like high school, Covey.
-I'm kinda counting on it.

60
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,871
-What about you? How's the future?

61
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,831
You're, like, 16 hours ahead there.

62
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,834
Tell me what Friday's gonna be like.
I promise I won't disrupt the timeline.

63
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,172
Well, it'll start off touristy,
and then it'll get really fun.

64
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,341
You'll buy presents for someone you love,

65
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,510
and if you're lucky, you'll eat doughnuts.

66
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,553
Uh, there was this one thing.

67
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,765
This girl,
she came up to me speaking Korean,

68
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,602
and it's like,
they see me and they think I understand

69
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,604
and then I don't,
and it's like I don't belong.

70
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,939
I don't know.

71
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,317
I guess I just wish
that my mom was here to teach me.

72
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,654
Well, I bet Stanford
offers Korean classes.

73
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,447
We could take 'em together.

74
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,158
I can't wait to see you.

75
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,704
I gotta get to practice.

76
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,165
Uh, is your dad taking you
to the locks tomorrow at Seoul Tower?

77
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,792
Mm-hmm. First thing.

78
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,419
Okay, well, good luck finding it.

79
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,297
In two days, I'm gonna tackle you
and smother you with kisses

80
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,506
and give you gifts.

81
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,966
I love you.

82
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,301
I love you too.

83
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,432
Ever since Peter and I
made a plan to go to Stanford together,

84
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,310
I feel like I'm waiting
for our future to begin.

85
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,937
It's the perfect school for us.

86
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,398
He'll play lacrosse.
I'll study English Lit.

87
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:19,277
And best of all, we won't be
one of those couples that breaks up

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,903
because of college.

89
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,656
I just have to get in first.

00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,768
- So tall!

We have to find the lock.

99
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,818
You know, your mother came here
the summer after we started dating,

100
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,029
and she wrote a wish
on one of these locks,

101
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,031
but she never told me what it said.

She was something else.

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,458
This should be it.

105
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,336

00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,567
Hey, let me get a picture of you
in the exact same spot.

119
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,235
No, Daddy, you have to be in it too.

120
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,070
I'll ask someone.

00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,322
-Okay.
-Excuse me.

122
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,200
Hi.

123
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,704
Oh! Uh, could you take a picture?

124
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,705
Ah.

125
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,253
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

126
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,131
You're welcome.

127
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,549
Oh, you speak English.

128
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,093
So do you.
Look how much we have in common.

129
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,179
-I'm Dae.
-I'm Katherine.

130
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,055
That was weird, that's not my name. Kitty.

131
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,683
Well, Katherine's kind of my name,
but people don't call me that.

132
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,976
-Call me Kitty.
- Ah, okay.

133
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,394
You can call me whatever, though.

134
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,395
-It's fine.
- Okay.

135
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,105
-Kitty. Okay. Yes.
-Sure, yeah.

136
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,858
Katherine Song Covey has discovered boys.

137
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,485
-God help 'em.

138
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,593
And you, buddy. Thank you.

139
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,723
Girls, I'm gonna help Trina with her bags.

140
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,726
-I want you to go on in without me.
-It's one bag. I got it, honey.

141
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,436
-Let me help you with the bags.

142
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,896
-Bye, Tri.
- Bye, ladies.

143
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:42,897
Bye, Tri.

144
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,482
-See you in a bit.
-Get some rest.

145
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,735
Impressed with you getting those.

146
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,821
Hi, Covey!

147
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,740
Peter!

148
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,701
Oh.

149
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,954
I missed you too, kiddo.

150
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,081
Especially when I made that sign.

151
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:04,585
Hmm. Your spatial planning could use work,
but I appreciate the glitter.

152
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,548
She approves of the glitter.

153
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,221
-Mmm.

154
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,349
-I missed you.
-I missed you more.

155
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,060
-Hi.
-Hi.

156
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,104
-Mm.

157
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,021
Ah.

158
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,190
Character socks!

159
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,818
Come on! Thanks.

160
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,238
They were kind of hard
to find in your size.

161
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,203
No, no! Truce or else
you don't get your last present.

162
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,706
Yes!

163
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,639
I got it at Seoul Tower,
so someday we can go back and put it on.

164
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,392
I love it.

165
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,394
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

166
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,523
Ew.

167
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,067
Aren't you supposed to make out
after the movie's started?

168
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,068
Not with Lara Jean.

169
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,154
She doesn't even let me talk
once the movie starts.

170
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,990
It's because I want you
to actually watch it.

171
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,743
And it's my turn tonight,
and we are doing Say Anything.

172
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,787
There's this great scene with John Cusack,
and he sits underneath the window.

173
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,373
-He holds up a boombox--
-Okay. That's awesome. We get it.

174
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,501
So, I have
a very important question for you, Peter.

175
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,421
What is the best text
you've ever gotten from a girl?

176
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,381
I'm… I'm sorry, what?

177
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,424
Kitty met a boy.

178
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,092
-Kit-- What?
-Mm-hmm!

179
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,387
-He's from Korea.
-What is his name?

180
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,807
Dae. And this is the first time
I'm contacting him.

181
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,018
-So it has to be memorable.
-Dunno why you're asking me.

182
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,479
You should talk to Lara Jean.
She's the queen of love letters.

183
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,814
Yeah. I said "memorable," not "cheesy."

184
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,734
Ow!

185
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,862
Okay, okay, okay.
I promise to coach you on your game

186
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,740
if you promise to teach me
how to braid Lara Jean's hair.

187
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,701
Okay, but you're never going to master
the French, Kavinsky.

188
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,953
Oh, I mastered the French.

189
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,872
You guys are disgusting.

190
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,873
Oh, yeah.

191
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,667
Because we're good at kissing.

192
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,589
-Kitty met a boy.
-Mm-hmm.

193
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,715
That's insane.

194
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,593
They met at the love locks.
Such a good meet-cute.

195
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,514
-What's a meet-cute?
-Have you learned nothing from rom-coms?

196
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,518
Always make grand gestures.
It's okay to interrupt a wedding…

197
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,398
A meet-cute
is when a couple meets for the first time.

198
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,984
It's always cute, and that is how you know
they're gonna end up together.

199
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,903
I wish we had a meet-cute.

200
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,992
Well, you jumped my bones
at the high school track.

201
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,369
That was pretty cute.

202
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,914
That doesn't count
'cause we already knew each other.

203
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,126
We don't have a song,
we don't have an anniversary,

204
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,753
and we can't remember how we met.

205
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,714
We are a terrible rom-com couple.

206
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,257
I remember when we met.

207
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,342
-You do not.
-Yeah, I do.

208
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,594
You don't remember when we-- when we met?

209
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,640
-I am offended right now.

210
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,060
-Okay, so tell me, how did we meet?
-No! You don't deserve to know.

211
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,478
Liar.

212
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,397
-Liar? Did you call me a liar? Tickle--

213
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:29,999
Mm?

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,126
Who was that?

215
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,587
Ah, it was nothing. It was just my dad.

216
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,924
I guess he heard about Stanford
and wants to take me out to celebrate.

217
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,301
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm.

218
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,928
-That's huge, Peter. Are you gonna do it?

219
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,514
Nah.

220
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,057
Maybe he's proud of you.

221
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,853
Maybe.
He doesn't really get to be, though.

222
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,480
He had nothing to do with it.

223
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,776
-Did you know…
-Hmm?

224
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,905
…that you smile in your sleep?

225
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,366
Wait, what time is it?

226
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,619
Um…

227
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,164
-It's almost curfew.

228
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,540
Wait, what?

229
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,541
Mm-hmm.

230
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,668
-You gotta go.

231
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,005
What if I didn't?

232
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,216
Then my dad would kill you.

233
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,384
-No, he wouldn't.
-Hmm.

234
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:27,264
But he'd give you his disappointed face,
which somehow is much worse.

235
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,063
You know what I'm looking forward to
the most about college?

236
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,064
Hmm?

237
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,942
Never having to say good night.

238
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,831
- Good night.
-Yeah.

239
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,207
Yeah.

240
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,638
In movies,
love is always about the big moments.

241
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,600
Grand speeches made in front of everyone,
"marry me" written on the Jumbotron.

242
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,729
But maybe love
is actually about the moments

243
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,815
when you think no one is watching.

244
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:22,361
Oh, good for Dr. Covey.
Trina's rad. And hot.

245
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,530
-You bring my zit cream?
- Obviously, Chris.

246
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,449
You are a gem, LJ.
Hey, any word yet from Stanford?

247
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,952
No, and it's killing me.

248
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,289
Thank God we don't live in the olden days.
Acceptances used to come by mail.

249
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,708
I can't stop thinking
how terrible it'll be if I don't get in.

250
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,545
You will. Or you'll come take a gap year
with me and work on a farm in Costa Rica.

251
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,048
So, what other schools are you waiting
to hear from, LJ?

252
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,675
Berkeley and UCLA

253
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,678
and NYU,
but I only applied there for Margot.

254
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,263
She said I'd be a failure at adulting

255
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,348
if I didn't have
at least one East Coast option.

256
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,474
She's not wrong.

257
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,728
Oh, what's going on over there?

258
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,568
♪ You are, you are the answer ♪

259
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,573
♪ You got all of my affection ♪

260
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,578
♪ You got, you got, you got
All my affection ♪

261
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,124
-♪ My attention, my affection ♪
-Chris, stop.

262
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,464
Molly Marshall,
will you go to prom with me?

263
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,257
Yes, of course. Yes!

264
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,592
-Yeah!

265
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,719
She said yes!

266
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,679
-Yeah! Whoo!
-That's what I'm talkin' about!

267
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,848
Ugh. You know who likes prom? Lemmings.

268
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,518
With their fancy dresses
and mani-pedis and blowouts.

269
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,855
Like you don't get blowouts.
I saw you on a date with Trevor last week.

270
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,066
Oh! I thought you were off again.

271
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,735
We are. We're just hanging out.

272
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,196
-Uh-huh.
-We are not dating.

273
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,405
Mm-hmm.

274
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,784
Not everything
that is popular is lame, Christine.

275
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,786
Some things are popular
because they're cool.

276
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,497
LJ, tiebreak. Prom, yay or nay?

277
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,916
It doesn't matter what she thinks.

278
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,043
Peter's gonna be prom king.
She has to go anyway.

279
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,213
Hey, I heard
you went to Korea for spring break.

280
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,758
That's awesome.
I know you always wanted to go.

281
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,717
Thanks. It was.

282
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,974
What?

283
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,518
You know
she's still the actual worst, right?

284
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,770
-Yay for prom.
-Ah.

285
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,773
-Just give me a little bit.
-Stop taking my girlfriend's cookies, bro.

286
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,401
Hey, Lucas. What's it gonna take
for Chris to go to prom with me?

287
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,695
Make sure no one else is going.

288
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,114
Promposal me, and it's over, Trevor.

289
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,825
So you're saying that there's something
between us that can be ended.

290
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,995
Hey, guys, you have your permission slips
for the senior trip to New York?

291
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,455
-Dipti, you are so responsible.
- New York City, baby!

292
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,040
I left mine in my locker.

293
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,834
-Thank you.
-There you go.

294
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,961
I think these are your best cookies yet.

295
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,672
They're still too crunchy.
We have to go to Levain in New York.

296
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,215
They have the cookies to beat.

297
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,010
Oh, I should--

298
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:54,722
Oh, by the way,
I shared an album with you on Spotify.

299
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,599
It's What's the Story Morning Glory
by Oasis.

300
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,271
-We need a song.
-Our song is not gonna be on a '90s album.

301
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,565
-Have you listened to Oasis?
-Not on purpose.

302
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,817
Talk to me when you have.

303
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,944
-Okay.
- Want some cookies?

304
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,576
We've both been married before.
We don't want to make a big fuss.

305
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,911
No, no, no.
You should absolutely make a fuss.

306
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,040
Do you know how long it took Dad
to find someone who will eat his cooking

307
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,750
and watch his documentaries?

308
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,667
Long time.

309
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,046
Let's just have it here at the house.
We can have a big barbecue/wedding

310
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,048
in the backyard.
You could make some desserts.

311
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,883
Oh, honey, I love that idea!

312
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,177
- You guys, I love that idea.

313
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,429
Can I be one of your bridesmaids?

314
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,514
-Kitty, you can't just ask that.
- Why?

315
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,268
Yes, you can. I would be honored
to have you girls as my bridesmaids.

316
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,687
And we can do a sparkler send-off.
That's my one request.

317
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,606
And we could do a sparkler send-off.

318
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,858
-Yes!

319
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,069
Okay, color scheme.

320
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,696
-Neon lime.
-Veto. Food?

321
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,614
-Chicken nuggets.
-Yes.

322
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,907
- Really?
-No.

323
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,747
- You okay, Lara Jean?
-Hmm?

324
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,082
-You okay?
-Yep.

325
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,251
I just remembered that there is something
that I need to go take care of.

326
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,753
-So, I'm gonna do that--

327
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,298
Henry! Are you okay? He's okay.

328
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,967

329
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,054
Hmm.

330
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,138
Is she okay?

331
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,431
You get used to it.

332
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,974
I never did get used to it.

333
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,727
You seem pretty used to it.

334
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,572
Okay, you got this.

335
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,076

Dae and I are way longer distance
and we're making it work.

348
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,782
But, we had a plan.

349
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,285
We were supposed to hold hands
while riding bikes

350
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,663
and play footsie in the library
and wear Tree hats to football games.

351
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,415
You don't even like football.

352
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,542
It's just so not the point, Kitty.

353
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,127
Hey, it's gonna be okay, LJ.

354
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,045
You and Peter
are going to figure this out.

355
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,590
- Hey, is everything okay?

356
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,758
No.
Lara Jean didn't make it into Stanford.

357
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,802
-Kitty!
-Okay, let me talk to her.

358
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,555
Hey, LJ. I'm so sorry.

359
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,308
Why?
You didn't want me to go there anyways.

360
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,061
No, that's not true. I just wanted you
to keep your options open.

361
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,023
You know, NYU has a 12-story library.

362
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,734
Please don't use this low moment
in my life to campaign for NYU.

363
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,360
I'm not. I'm just saying.

364
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,864
Look, Stanford is not the only college
in the world.

365
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,241
I never thought I'd end up in Scotland,

366
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,035
and I know
it doesn't feel like it right now,

367
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,829
but this could be a really good thing
for you, you know?

368
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,539
Force you to see the world.

369
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,626
Well, I'm not like you, Margot.
I don't wanna be far away from my family.

370
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,215
I didn't mean it like that.

371
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,177
No, it's fine. I should get back to bed.
I have an exam tomorrow anyway.

372
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,766
I'm gonna go.

373
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,693
What am I gonna tell Peter?

374
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,530

00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,667

379
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,687

- No!

380
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,438

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,993

-Do I have to wear the hat?

410
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,789
Of course you have to wear the hat.
Gotta rep the Tree.

411
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,500
You gotta fear the Tree.
That's how it works.

412
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,921
Tonight, we're celebrating.

413
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:47,050
My girlfriend has gotten
into Stanford University today.

414

What's your major?

416
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,391
Uh, no, that doesn't really matter--

417
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:58,520
Come on. Tell her.
Baby, tell her. Come on. Just tell her.

English Lit.

419

as their major when they don't really know

420
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,779
what they want to do in their life,
but I actually really want to do it, so…

421
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:12,284
Well, the best part is we both got in,

422
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,369
so we're going together.

423
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,540
Now, if that's not a sign that
we're meant to be, I don't know what is.

424
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,126
Well, I'm happy for you both.

425
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,796
Do you think that
we can get strawberry pancakes? And…

426
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,882
Uh, just two forks.

427
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,966
Coming right up.

428
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,885
You don't want anything else?

429
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,388
I'm not really that hungry, so…
Peter, I need to tell you something.

430
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,558
I didn't… I didn't tell her
to put whipped cream on it.

431
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,937
Hold that thought. I'll be right back.
I promise. I'll be right back.

432
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,588
Do you remember

433
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,131

Our first public appearance
as a fake couple.

435
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,930
You were wearing that blue jacket
and that little dress,

436
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,225
and you were calling me out
on all of my shit.

437
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,063
And I knew then
that I was falling in love with you.

438
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,402
So, I couldn't think of a better place
to ask you this question

439
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,863
-that I want to ask you.

440
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,740

00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,373

Yes, of course.

00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,139
Oh, yeah. Um…

00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,117
Oh, and they said marrying a doctor
wouldn't be glamorous.

468
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,245
Hey, Lara Jean,
how come you're not in school today?

469
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,540
Mono or dysentery.
Whichever sounds more contagious.

470
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,752
Oh, mono's way more contagious.
I love you, girls. I'll see you at seven.

471
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,170
-Love you!

472
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,923
-What you watching?
-Romeo and Juliet.

473
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,972
Tragic romance before 8:00 a.m.
Must be pretty serious.

474
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,608
I didn't tell Peter about Stanford.

475
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,451
He was just so excited,
and I didn't want to crush him.

476
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,625
And if I don't tell him,
then it's not real yet.

477
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,335
Yeah, I get that.

478
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,051
You know, I know I'm new
to this whole stepmom thing,

479
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,389
but I'm pretty sure you can't call in sick
from a relationship.

480
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,266
I'm not proud of myself
if that makes a difference.

481
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,601
I mean, it helps.

482
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,439
Can I make a suggestion?

483
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,317
You only get
one senior year of high school,

484
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,986
and if you spend the whole time
worrying about what's gonna happen

485
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,781
with you and Peter,
you're gonna miss the whole thing.

486
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,784
My God, you've got a hot boyfriend.
Go enjoy him.

487
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,370
Don't, it-- Don't, enjoy--

488
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:30,375
Like, in public with the ice cream
and holding hands is a good thing.

489
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,836
Just no texting and driving.

490
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,339
You know, Tri,
this whole stepmom thing suits you.

491
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,298
Thank you.

492
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,883
But I will tell Dad that you said that.

493
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,760
Girl, I will cut you.

494
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,056
-UC Berkeley just tweeted.
-Oh, my God.

495
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,517
We can do this. We can do this.

496
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,436
- Mm-mm. No.
- Come on.

497
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,857
Here are the passwords. You do it.

498
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,735
-You sure you don't wanna do it?
-I can't. I'm bad luck.

499
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,111
-Give it to me.
-Okay.

500
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,452
Well?

501
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,705
She got in. You got in!

502
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,708
I got in? Where? show me! No!

503
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,963
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

504
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,214
-Hi, Henry!

505
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,553
It isn't Stanford,
but Berkeley's an hour away.

506
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,806
That's practically like going
to college together.

507
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,728
You left this downstairs.
It's all your college portal logins.

508
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,397
Keep it. You're officially in charge
of all my college acceptances.

509
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,524
Seriously? Cool!

510
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,736
Hey, Kitty. On a scale of one to ten,

511
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,363
how much are you gonna miss me
when I'm gone next year?

512
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,574
It's way too early for this talk.

513
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,909
You can be honest.

514
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,453
I don't know, a four?

515
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,496
A four?

516
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,290
You told Margot
that you were gonna miss her a 6.9.

517
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,250
Yeah, I was a child then.

518
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,794
And she's nicer than you are.

519
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,422
You could at least pretend to miss me.
It's only decent. Also…

525
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,605
Why am I looking at those?

526
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,856
They're commuter shoes.

527
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,526
New Yorkers wear them to the office
and change when they get there.

528
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,860
I want to look like a local.

529
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,613
You're gonna look like a tourist
who read about locals on Google.

530
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,244
In a way, it's good I didn't tell Peter
until I heard from Berkeley.

531
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,164
Now, when I finally break the news to him,
it'll be way easier.

532
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,834
You should consider
giving Peter a picture of you

533
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,836
to put up in his dorm room at Stanford.

534
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,046
Ooh, yeah!
You should do a boudoir shoot.

535
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,339
Chris, no.

536
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,549
Why not? They're classy.

537
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:47,262
Uh, because I'm 17,
so I actually can't do a boudoir shoot.

538
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,098
And also, Peter's never seen me naked.

539
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,810
You mean like, you always wear a T-shirt
or keep the lights turned off or…

540
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,312
No, like, we, uh, haven't…

541
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,571
We burn low and slow, okay?

542
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,031
We're like, um… brisket.

543
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:12,203
Well, the brisket is cooked, sister,
so clear the table,

544
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,373
slather some sauce on it, and go to town!

545
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,041
Gross.

546
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,420
Mm? Really? You know,
I think it sounds delicious.

547
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,800
Jesus. Christine,
did you pack your whole closet?

548
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,846
I don't believe in carry-ons, Dr. Covey.
Why limit one's options?

549
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,100
So no one tears a rotator cuff.
Let's, uh, let's go.

550
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,770
-We are going to look amazing in New York.

551
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,441
This bus is full. Head straight down.

552
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,862
Why are you carrying a casket to New York?

553
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,530
Because I'm dead inside.

554
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,532
Oh, ho, ho.
You got jokes this morning, huh?

555
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,909
-Always.

556
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,037
- Okay. Set it down.
-Okay.

557
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:59,208
Are we, um, overcompensating
here again, hmm, Chrissy?

558
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,504
All right. Now or never.

559
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,882
Are you ready to talk to Kavinsky?

560
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,427
No. No, I'm gonna wait.
Tell him when I get there.

561
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,137
Good call.

562
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,349
You don't wanna get stuck
on a plane with him if it goes badly.

563
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,393
You think it's gonna go badly?

564
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,939

We're here. We made it.

We're trying. I'm sorry.

585
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,848
-Go get the key, okay?
-I'm going!

586
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,807

-What's happening?
-Don't look at me.

589
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,483
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

590
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,570
is to meet me back here
in the lobby at 2100 hours.

591
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,363
We're going out.

00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,407

-Don't look at me.

That information is classified.

594
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,871
I'm pretty sure
we're supposed to stay in our rooms.

595
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,957
Intel suggests that the chaperones
are going to be at the hotel bar

596
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,294
getting absolutely wasted,

00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,088

Can't believe we listened
to eight hours of music

608
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,917
and still didn't find anything.

609
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,711
Maybe it's just
that we can't pick the song.

610
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,882
Maybe the song has to pick us, you know?
Like some right moment or whatever.

611
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:58,513
I agree, but I'm not in a rush.
We have all of college to figure that out.

612
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,912
I didn't get into Stanford.

613
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,127
What?

614
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,797
Uh, the text that I sent you,
it was a mistake. It was to Margot.

615
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,008
-It was about something else.
-I don't get what you're saying.

616
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,595
We're not going to college
together, Peter. I got rejected.

617
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,351
But it's fine 'cause I got into Berkeley,
and I know that's not what we planned,

618
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,688
but it's only an hour away and I'm gonna
get better at driving and we can spend--

619

Stop. Stop. Stop.

620
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,784
Are you okay?

621
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,248
I'm sorry.
I really wanted to make it work for us.

622
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,791
Hey. Stop. Stop.

623
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,505
This is not your fault. Okay?

624
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:15,965
At all.

625
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,597
It's bullshit
that you didn't get into Stanford.

626
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,140
You're, like, way smarter than me.

627
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,726
-Yeah. I mean, not "yeah," but…

628
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:30,104
-You are smarter than me.
-You worked really hard to get in, so…

629
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,107
Still, we're not going
to college together.

630
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,240
Wait…

631
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,744
Just transfer after your freshman year.

632
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,246
What?

633
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,832
Yeah, you're fine.
You're an hour away. So what?

634
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,043
We get to see each other
every single weekend,

635
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,004
and then you transfer to Stanford
after your freshman year.

636
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:58,507
-Really? You think we can make that work?
-Yes, 100%.

637
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,093
A hundred percent.

638
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,430
Okay.

639
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,725
We're gonna get through this.

640
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,442
Does that mean I get to keep my Tree hat?

641
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,488
Yes, but you gotta keep it on the DL.

642
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,198
Stanford and Berkeley are rivals.

643
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,909
So, that makes us
like Romeo and Juliet of college,

644
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,746
but minus the poison and the murder stuff,
but that's very exciting.

no switching groups. Any questions?

Yes. Can we please switch groups?

It's okay. We're gonna make it work.

772
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,509
For sure. No, for sure.

773
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,010
I totally get it.

774
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,513
I had someone
I wanted to go to college with too.

775
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,727
Uh, what happened?

776
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,187
Um…

777
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:36,108
I visited NYU,
fell in love with this city.

778
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,737
I don't know. It was weird.

779
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,240
I just felt like
this was where I was supposed to be.

780
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,076
We figured out what was best for us.

781
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,331
Hey, your crew seems
to be having a good time.

782
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,376
Yeah, um, you know they hate each other.

783
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,462
Not tonight they don't.

789
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,024
-Pink couch.
-Pink couch?

00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,485
-Ani's ex won't give it back to her.
-Even though it's mine.

-I said, you got your couch.

807
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,453
You know, this could be us someday.

808
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,875
I could see it.

809
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,634
-Crazy.

810
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,594
I'm so sweaty. I need to shower.

811
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,013
-I have face masks up in the room.
-Oh, dibs on the robe.

812
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,139
Covey.

813
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:35,185
Peter, hi. What are you doing up?

814
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,479
-Waiting for you.
-Oh.

815
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,147
You never texted me back. I was worried.

816
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:42,651
Sorry, it's kind of a long story.
I'll see you guys up in the room.

817
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,320
Am I hallucinating?
Are they getting along?

818
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,699
Careful. They spook easily.
How was your day?

819
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,743
It's better now. I missed you.
Come on. Let's go to my room.

820
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,288
I missed you too.
Did you get the video I sent you?

821
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:59,209
Yeah, I did. It was, you know--
Cool song, but I wasn't there for it.

822
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,839
So, I feel like I should be there
for the song that we make ours.

823
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,967
Yeah, but it was that moment. I felt it.

824
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,596
Well, we can always come back to it
if we don't find something else.

825
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,769
How was the world's best cookie?

826
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,787
I don't know, Margot.
I didn't expect to feel so surprised.

827
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,750
I knew Tri was moving in this weekend.
She practically lives here anyway.

828
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,878
It's like the world keeps shifting
under my feet

829
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,881
when all I want is for it to stand still.

830
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,257
It just feels weird.

831
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,510
It is weird. Mom is all over that house,

832
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,138
and now it feels like she's being erased.

833
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,642
I mean, are you upset
they're getting married?

834
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,853
No, I just never pictured it.

835
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,563
But…

836
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,278
it's kind of nice, right?

837
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,322
Dad having someone.

838
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,241
Even if that someone
does own a blue velvet headboard.

839
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,159
Ew!

840
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,078
Don't talk about their bed.

841
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,125
I'm sorry for the stuff I said
about you leaving.

842
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,046
It's okay. I shouldn't have
pushed you about New York.

843
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,676
No, you were right. I totally loved it.

844
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,761
You did?

845
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,515
Yeah, I mean,
I thought that I was gonna hate it

846
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,101
or I thought
that I would feel overwhelmed,

847
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,772
but I could really see myself
living there, you know?

848
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,108
I get why so many books are set there.

849
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,693
Everywhere you look, there's a story.

850
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,445
And NYU has this amazing lit program

851
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,031
where they invite real authors
to come speak to their students.

852
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,909
And I could even intern
at a publishing house.

853
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,870
So, it just, um… doesn't really matter

854
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,748
'cause I'm not sure that--
I don't even think I got in, so…

855
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,419
LJ, college is about more
than just geography.

856
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,170
I know that.

857
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,132
But Berkeley is a great school,

858
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,801
and if I keep my grades up,
I can transfer to Stanford.

859
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:16,471
Now that Peter and I have a new plan,
everything could go back to normal.

860
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,435
Just make sure that's what you want.

861
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,022
It's what I want. Don't worry.

862
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,449
-Nope.

863
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,450
Hi.

864
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,703
What do you think about go-karts?

865
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,204
Like, in general or…

866
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,581
For Peter and me.

867
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,624
Fast and Furious is one
of his favorite movies.

868
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,294
Okay. Well, there's nothing fast
or furious about go-karts.

869
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,756
What about
one of those indoor skydiving tubes,

870
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,841
like from Mission: Impossible
or James Bond?

871
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,427
Soap-making.

872
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,013
Fight Club.

873
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,808
What is happening?

874
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,770
I'm planning a date,
and it has to be fun and normal.

875
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:09,691
And you think teaching Peter Kavinsky
to make soap is normal?

876
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,528
Maybe I should just give him
all three options and have him choose.

877
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,908
But not soap-making?

878
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,035
Absolutely not.

879
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,538
Put it back.

880
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,551
All right, Covey. Where we going?

881
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,220
Excellent question, Peter Kavinsky.

882
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,431
One that I asked myself many times
while planning this evening.

883
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,601
What is the perfect date
for my perfect boyfriend?

884
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:51,316
Dude… let's go bowling.

885
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,569
Did you just quote The Big Lebowski?

886
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,030
Yes.

887
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,323
-Ready?
-Yes.

888
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,241
Let's go!

889
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,845
Oh, you're cute. Come on!

890
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:02,804
Wait, wait. But I--

891
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,264
I'm gonna put this in my dorm room.

892
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,600
-What if I want to put it in my dorm room?
-That's too bad.

893
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,726
Peter.

894
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:10,812
Dad.

895
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,316
You must be Laura.
I've heard so much about you.

896
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,402
-Lara Jean, Dad.
-No, it's okay.

897
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:20,906
It's not okay. You're my dad.
You should know my girlfriend's name.

898
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,825
Apologies, Lara Jean.
Very nice to meet you.

899
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,826
You too.

900
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,162
Have you given any thought to dinner?

901
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:32,209
Yeah. I'm just really busy right now.
You know, I'm training a lot for college.

902
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,543
Well, you gotta eat, right?

903
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,423
Let me take you to that steakhouse
you love. The place with the big knives.

904
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,302
Yeah, Dad.
They were big when I was, like, five.

905
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:46,890
Well, in any case,
I'd love to see you before you go.

906
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,813
You want to come bowl with us?
We're just getting started over there.

907
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:01,029
No, no, that's all right.
Thanks, though. We gotta go.

908
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:05,283
But, uh, thank you.
Have fun with the… with the fam.

909
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:07,744
Okay.

910
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,226
I can go with you if you want.

911
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:35,897
No. No, he doesn't get to bail on us
and then just have it be okay.

912
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:38,984
Well, it doesn't make it okay.

913
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,697
And it will never be okay,
but at least it could be something.

914
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,658
So you think I should go?

915
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,789
I think that if I had…

916
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:57,335
a chance to spend one more night
with my mom,

917
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:58,795
I would take it.

918
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,463
Yeah, but it's different, LJ.

919
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,882
Your mom didn't leave you.

920
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,843
Not-- Not by… by choice.

921
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,095
I'm not saying it's easier.

922
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,765
You think of your mom,
and you miss her, right?

923
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,977
I think about my dad, and I hate him.

924
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,022
And… and I miss him.

925
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,607
And then I hate that I miss him.

926
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,156
Hey.

927
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,787
There is nothing worse
than not feeling chosen.

928
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,134
I choose you, Peter Kavinsky.

929
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,812
I choose you too.

930
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,199
I don't know…

931
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,118
what I would do without you.

932
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,000
-Oh, I love your forehead kisses.
-You do?

933
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,211
-Mm-hmm.
-Even if I get lipstick on you?

934
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,587
You mark me as yours.

935
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,048
Like your shirt?
Gonna wear it all the time?

936
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,050
You kidding me?
I'm wearing it to school tomorrow.

937
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,136
-No, you're not! Really?
-Definitely not. That's not happening.

938
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,202
Well, it smells good in here.

939
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,497
I am experimenting
with the wedding cake recipes.

940
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,666
That's it. We're done.
I'm breaking up with him.

941
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,168
- With who?
-Who do you think, Dad?

942
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,004
Dae. He hates Harry Potter.

943
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:10,260
He said, and I quote, that "it's so dumb."

944
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,304
How am I supposed to be
in a relationship with someone

945
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,891
who thinks the greatest
literary achievement of our time is dumb?

946
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,562
Well, I know. But, honey, it's okay
to have differences in relationships.

947
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,107
If you feel the same way
about everything, you'll never grow.

948
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,985
Mm-hmm. So, you're saying
I should try and change him.

949
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,237
That's very much not what I'm saying.

950
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,031
Kitty… what is this?

951
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,117
Oh, yeah, you got into NYU.

952
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,786
And you just decided not to tell me?

953
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,247
Well, you're going to Berkeley,
so it doesn't matter.

954
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,545
No, you're not allowed to be mad at me
because I am heartbroken and sad.

955
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,387
What?

956
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:58,224
You got into NYU. Are you kidding me?

957
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,062
Good for you, honey.

958
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:05,940
It's cool.

959
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,945
Do you know the best part
about you getting into Berkeley?

960
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,989
We're going to be able to meet
in San Francisco on the weekends

961
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,449
and explore the city.

962
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,035
We never could have done that
if we were both going to Stanford.

963
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,205
We're going to be able
to go to Golden Gate Park,

964
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,040
Muir Woods, Fisherman's Wharf.

965
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,919
And we're going to try every single piece
of sourdough that city has to offer.

966
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,673
Are you listening?

967
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,677
Covey, are you listening to me?

968
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,596
I was just saying that
we gotta go to Tartine Bakery

969
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,766
when we're in San Francisco. Apparently,
they have the best cookies in the city.

970
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,352
Oh, right. Sorry.

971
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,943
You know, I was just thinking

972
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,612
there aren't that many romances
set in San Francisco.

973
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,198
There's The Wedding Planner
and The Bachelor,

974
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,700
but that's about it.

975
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:44,247
New York has all the greats.
You've Got Mail, When Harry Met Sally,

976
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,541
Annie Hall, Serendipity.

977
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,293
It's… it's really not a competition.

978
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:52,380
Yeah. I didn't know
that there was a competition.

979
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,967
Oh, it's not. I was just thinking.

980
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,386
-I'm this way.
-Okay.

981
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,345
Bye.

982
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,408
I can't decide.

983
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:23,494
Navy goes better with Peter's tux,
and we did plan to match,

984
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,748
but… I don't want to disappoint him.

985
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,751
Is the pink more me, though?

986
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:35,965
Will I regret it if I don't wear it?
Will I look back in two or ten or 20 years

987
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,384
and wonder if I made the wrong choice?

988
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,219
I mean, how am I supposed to know…

989
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,680
…what choice
would make me happier in the future?

990
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,307
What is wrong with you?

991
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,933
What? Nothing. Why?

992
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,812
To limo or not to limo?

993
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:51,939
That is the question.

994
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,940
Is it?

995
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,902
Yeah, Kavinsky wants
to be buzzkill and keep it low-key,

996
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,945
but I'm saying that we only get one prom.

997
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,490
See?
That's why I didn't want to go.

998
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:04,952
Put a school dance
in an ugly hotel ballroom,

999
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,372
and everyone wants to get all extra.

1000
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,957
Mmm. So limo is a yes.

1001
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:14,170
The sunroof
and black lights and some little…

1002
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,422
I know a guy.

1003
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,217
Hey, Gen. Can I talk to you for a sec?

1004
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,386
-Yeah. Um, I'll catch you later.
-Okay.

1005
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,681
-Oh, my God, cute shoes. I like those.
-Thanks.

1006
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,766
What's up?

1007
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,479
So, I got into NYU.

1008
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,066
What? That's amazing.

1009
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:37,902
Isn't it?

1010
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:42,657
I mean, yes!
Yes it is, um, but… should I go?

1011
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,286
Why are you asking me that?

1012
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:52,875
I just don't know what I want,
and I figured you're going…

1013
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,170
I don't know.

1014
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,841
Well, I don't know what you should do,

1015
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:03,261
but I know the way you looked at New York.

1016
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,681
It was love at first sight.

1017
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,728
Hey, if you do decide to go to NYU,

1018
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,813
just let me know.

1019
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,412
Hey, you still not sleeping?

1020
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,707
Figured I might as well practice
the wedding cake.

1021
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,502
Mint chocolate for you.
Vanilla buttercream for Tri.

1022
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,550
That seems like a lot.
Why don't you just bake cookies?

1023
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,302
That's your specialty.

1024
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,596
'Cause I haven't perfected my recipe.

1025
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,901
Hey, do you think
you and Tri would be together

1026
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,279
if you didn't live close
or is that part of it?

1027
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,115
Yeah, I guess. I guess it was,

1028
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,326
but proximity's not
the most important thing.

1029
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:12,330
So is space,
and a good relationship has both.

1030
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,959
Three thousand miles
seems like maybe too much space.

1031
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,462
Nah, not if it's what you want.

1032
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,635
Listen, Lara Jean,
you gotta stay true to yourself.

1033
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:30,765
Okay? You can't save this relationship
by not growing.

1034
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:40,900
What is it?

1035
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,821
I messed up the cake batter.
Now it's gonna be like cookie dough.

1036
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,159
I like it.

1037
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,383
- Have enough syrup?
- Mm-hmm.

1038
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,551
- Butter?
-Mm-hmm.

1039
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,180
Whipped cream?
You probably need more whipped cream.

1040
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,975
I'll just-- Hey, Joan,
can we get more whipped cream, please?

1041
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:14,934
Sure.

1042
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,483
Hey, so I'm thinking about going to NYU.

1043
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,240
What do you mean,
you're thinking about it?

1044
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,369
I want to go to NYU.

1045
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,167
And I know that's not what we planned,
but they have an amazing lit program,

1046
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,671
and I really feel like
I belong there, Peter.

1047
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:48,843
And I'm afraid
that I'm gonna regret it if I don't go.

1048
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,183
Please say something.

1049
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,686
I don't know what to say. Um…

1050
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,314
I wasn't expecting that.

1051
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,488
It's far. It's, like, really far away.

1052
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,660
But it's only a year.

1053
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,998
I guess we can make anything work
for a year, so…

1054
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,751
I'm not sure I'm gonna want to transfer.

1055
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,547
I think I might
really love it there, Peter.

1056
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,508
And wouldn't that be great?

1057
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,928
Isn't that the whole point?

1058
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:32,887
Wait, so…

1059
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,893
So that's it? No more Stanford.

1060
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:43,397
You're-- You're going to NYU?

1061
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,493
Okay.

1062
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,331
I mean, it's your future.

1063
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,335
Right?
And you gotta do what's best for you.

1064
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,049
I can't say no to Stanford.

1065
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,510
You can't say no to NYU.

1066
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,514
I guess we have made our choice.

1067
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,642
Here we go.

1068
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,394
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

1069
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,987
Do you want to talk about it, or…?

1070
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,946
No.

1071
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,659
We're good. We're good.

1072
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,339
Boo!

1073
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,591
-Hey, you're getting out of here too!

1074
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:56,554
Well, Sarah Lawrence is only
a two-hour train ride from the city.

1075
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:00,224
I'm coming over every weekend,
and we are gonna go dancing

1076
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,309
and have a good time.

1077
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,065
I'm guessing he didn't take it that well.

1078
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,487
Uh, no, he did,
which somehow felt much worse.

1079
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,993
You are going to figure it out. Okay?

1080
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,328
You're totally relationship goals.

1081
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:27,168
If there's anybody that can do
long distance, it's you and him.

1082
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,337
Hey.

1083
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,381
What's up?

1084
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:43,267
Make it memorable, romantic,
and no quotes from famous dead poets.

1085
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:47,480
Covey, yearbooks are for people
you're never gonna see again.

1086
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,190
That's not true.

1087
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:52,359
They're for remembering where you were
in this exact moment in your life.

1088
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:58,324
So, you're saying that
you're gonna need help to remember me?

1089
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,534
-No, that's not--
-Hey.

1090
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:03,287
If it's important to you,
I will absolutely sign it,

1091
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:08,709
but you have to write me
an OG love letter.

1092
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:13,339
And I'm talking, like, middle school OG.

1093
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,466
Well, you already got one of those.

1094
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:20,096
Yeah, well,
then you gotta make it memorable.

1095
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:27,311
Mason jars or tree rounds?

1096
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:29,522
Mason jars are overrated, Tri.

1097
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,649
What? Why? No, I like them.

1098
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:34,443
Are you planning a wedding
or a Mumford and Sons concert?

1099
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,861
-That's mean.

1100
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,114
-Are you watching baseball?
-Oh, yeah, who's winning?

1101
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,033
Who cares? How can anyone enjoy this?

1102
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,410
Kitty promised to watch
Dae's favorite sport

1103
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,496
as long as he read Harry Potter.

1104
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:47,456
Yeah, in retrospect, not a fair trade.

1105
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,292
Have you decided on the color
for the bridesmaids dresses?

1106
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,836
We should really put in the order.

1107
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:55,673
I'm not wearing a dress.
I'm wearing a tux with sneakers.

1108
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,758
-Excuse me?
- What? She said I could.

1109
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:58,717
I did.

1110
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:03,848
-No. The three of us should match.
-Oh, great, then wear a tux.

1111
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,808
You're gonna ruin the whole look.

1112
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,853
Well, it's not your wedding, Lara Jean,
so stop trying to control everything

1113
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:11,480
just 'cause you're freaked out
you and Peter are gonna break up.

1114
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,859
Kitty. Why would you say that?

1115
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,744
What? You know I'm right.

1116
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:30,249
Maybe,
but that doesn't make saying it right.

1117
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,926
Well, there's still plenty of time
to back out, you know.

1118
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,138
Never.

1119

01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:47,556
What is this?

1234
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,688
Oh, no way.

1235
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,571
Oh, my gosh.

1236
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:10,162
Oh, my God, remember this test?
Is this all of them?

1237
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,163
Mm-hmm.

1238
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,508
I thought you wanted to keep this.

1239
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:27,012
I want you to have it.
Something to remember us by.

1240
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,146
Thank you.

1241
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:37,981
Do you like it?

1242
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,692
I love it.

1243
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:30,075
Hey, hey.

1244
01:20:33,286 --> 01:20:34,329
Are you sure?

1245
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:36,373
I'm sure.

1246
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:42,838
-Do you not want to?
-No.

1247
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:43,964
No, no, no. I do.

1248
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,843
You have no idea
how much I've thought about this.

1249
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:51,847
Okay, then what's wrong?

1250
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:58,061
I don't know.
Something just doesn't feel right.

1251
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:04,025
Why now, on prom night?

1252
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:07,320
'Cause I want to feel close to you.

1253
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,783
And ever since I told you about NYU,
you've been acting really distant.

1254
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:18,665
So what? You want to have sex with me
because you're feeling insecure?

1255
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:20,667
No, that's… that's not what I mean.

1256
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,544
What did you expect?

1257
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,967
You literally chose to go
as far away from me as possible.

1258
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,428
You chose distance.

1259
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,179
That's not fair.

1260
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:37,058
What's not fair is you acting like
this is just gonna be okay.

1261
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:41,688
I think we both know what 3,000 miles
is gonna do to us.

1262
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:43,607
No, we don't.

1263
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:45,275
Yeah. Yeah, we do.

1264
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:47,694
Otherwise, you wouldn't have made me this.

1265
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,615
Something to remember us by? Come on.

1266
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,659
-You're saying goodbye.
-That's not true.

1267
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,495
I want to be with you.
That's all I've ever wanted.

1268
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,041
Then why aren't you going to Berkeley?

1269
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,712
'Cause I fell in love with New York.

1270
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,686
But that doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

1271
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,313
We could still make this work.

1272
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,025
No.

1273
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:32,197
I'm not gonna wait for this to end
in three or six months

1274
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,239
or however long we last.

1275
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,241
-No, please don't do this.
-Let's just end it now.

1276
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,242
Peter.

1277
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,037
I love you.

1278
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,249
Not enough, apparently.

1279
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:35,969
♪ I still love the way you smile
And the way you say my name ♪

1280
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:42,350
♪ I think I'll fall apart
If you choose to stay away ♪

1281
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:53,445

Nothing stays the same ♪

1282
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:59,451
♪ I know nothing
Nothing stays the same ♪

1283
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,589
This isn't healthy.

1284
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,133
Oh, and that is?

1285
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,761
Everyone eats their feelings.

1286
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,555
And yours happen to have…

1287
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:06,851
Ooh. Peanut butter and cookies.

1288
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:10,563
Damn, LJ. You got some delicious feelings.

1289
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,238
Maybe I should just go to Berkeley.

1290
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:24,285
Okay, no.
You made the right decision, Lara Jean.

1291
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,245
Mm.

1292
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:28,957
Then why does it feel so bad?

1293
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,885
Trevor. I may or may not have agreed

1294
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,555
to start dating him again
last night at prom.

1295
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:48,268
Before you get too excited,
it is only until I leave for Costa Rica

1296
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:53,731
because I have plans
and I am not swerving for any man.

1297
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,736
Well, I'm happy for you, Chris.

1298
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,364
I've always liked you two together.

1299
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:02,907
Mm-hmm.

1300
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:06,244
It seems a little backwards though, right?

1301
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:10,874
Me and Trevor get together
the same night you and Peter break up.

1302
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:15,962
We're in the darkest timeline.

1303
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,008
Lara Jean, can I come in?

1304
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,094
Lara Jean's not here.
Please leave a message.

1305
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,055
Who leaves messages anymore?

1306
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,391
What do you want, Kitty?

1307
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,690
I didn't forget to tell you about NYU.

1308
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:39,527
I chose not to.

1309
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:40,904
What? Why?

1310
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,328
I don't know.

1311
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:52,373
I guess I was just scared
you were gonna go.

1312
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:59,464
I'm gonna miss you a 12, Lara Jean.

1313
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,383
Oh, come here.

1314
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,945
- Margot!
-Hi. Oh my goodness. Hi!

1315
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:24,822
Oh, it's so good to see you.

1316
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,493
Hey, listen, Margot.

1317
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,537
I know it must be weird
coming home to all this,

1318
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,916
but I don't want you feeling like
I'm trying to take over your house.

1319
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,253
Well, it's our house now,

1320
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:43,925
and I haven't seen my dad
this happy in a really long time.

1321
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:46,719
Thank you.

1322
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:51,266
Okay, so…

1323
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:53,559
It's crazy that I can feel

1324
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:56,938
so sad and so happy at the same time.

1325
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:04,070
My love story is ending,
but my dad and Trina's is just beginning.

1326
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,117
I guess that's what happens
when you grow up.

1327
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:12,829
Everything gets all mixed up together.

1328
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:47,655
Peter.

1329
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:49,407
Hey.

1330
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,286
Hey. And I thought I was early.
You hungry?

1331
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:54,787
No, I'm good, thanks.

1332
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,080
Are you sure? I'm buying.

1333
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,124
Yeah, no. I'm sure. Thanks.

1334
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:02,962
I'm really glad that you called.
I didn't think that you would.

1335
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:07,091
Yeah, well, you know.
Lara Jean thought that I should, so…

1336
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,926
You two have fun at prom?

1337
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,223
Can we just-- Can we not?

1338
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:19,270
I just-- I can't do the thing
where you act like you want to be my dad.

1339
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,106
Get you boys something to drink?

1340
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,900
A coffee, please.

1341
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,569
I'm fine. Thanks, Joan.

1342
01:29:26,652 --> 01:29:27,779
Okay.

1343
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:36,037
Look, I know calling or sending a card
on your birthday isn't enough.

1344
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,248
I'm trying to fix that.

1345
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,959
Two months before I leave to college?

1346
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,963
I want to be part of your life.

1347
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:51,386
Yeah. Well, then, you know,
maybe you should have been here for it.

1348
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,765
'Cause I did everything without you

1349
01:29:57,266 --> 01:29:59,727
and I still don't need you,

1350
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:05,400
so I'm sorry that there's a disconnect
between you and me.

1351
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,575
You're mad, and I get that.

1352
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:17,412
I would be too.

1353
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,206
But you have to know…

1354
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:25,044
I… I wasn't leaving you.

1355
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,052
Then why does it feel like it, Dad?

1356
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:47,233
Because I screwed up.

1357
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:53,531
I didn't try hard enough.

1358
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:03,541
I should have tried harder
to be your dad and I didn't.

1359
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:11,966
If you love somebody, that's what you do.

1360
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:14,010
You try to do everything you can.

1361
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,852
I love you, Peter.

1362
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,160
You don't have to stay here.

1363
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:53,257
Thanks.

1364
01:31:57,553 --> 01:31:59,096
-Hey, Joan.
-Mm-hmm?

1365
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,349
Can I get a coffee too, please?

1366
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:02,892
Sure.

1367
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:06,938
What?

1368
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,274
You're buying.

1369
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:24,664
…so you may grow together through
all the twists and turns of your life?

1370
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,582
I do.

1371
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:29,919
And do you, Trina,
take Dan to be your husband?

1372
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:35,550
Do you promise to love him,
cherish him, and hold him,

1373
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:37,927
but not too tightly,

1374
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,889
so that you may grow together
through the twists and turns of your life?

1375
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,599
I do.

1376
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:45,851
Then,
by the power vested in me,

1377
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:48,604
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1378
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,439
-Whoo!

1379
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:56,612
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you the newlyweds,

Dear Lara Jean.

1417
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:23,504
you told me to write
something memorable, so here it is,

1418
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:27,091
my memory of the first time I met you

1419
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:30,135
or, as you like to call it, our meet-cute.

1420
01:37:30,761 --> 01:37:32,638
It was sixth grade assembly.

1421
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:34,682
You were sitting
in the row in front of me,

1422
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:39,019
and your name was written
on your backpack in glittery letters.

1423
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:43,732
Principal Cho called you up on stage
to receive an attendance award,

1424
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:47,820
and your hair got caught in your chair.

1425
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:53,200
I helped you untangle it,
and you smiled at me.

1426
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:57,997
My heart did a somersault in my chest.

1427
01:37:58,622 --> 01:38:00,499
I didn't know hearts could do that.

1428
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:07,006
I had no clue then
that you would become who you are now,

1429
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:10,467
the most important person in my life.

1430
01:38:11,343 --> 01:38:14,555
Sometimes, I can't believe
how lucky I am that you chose me.

1431
01:38:14,638 --> 01:38:17,516
We've been through
so much together, Lara Jean,

1432
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,145
and I never should have doubted
that we'd get through this too.

1433
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,273
But, I got scared and I hurt you.

1434
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,943
I am so, so sorry.

1435
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:30,487
Of course you should go to New York.

1436
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:32,615
You should do all the things
you want to do.

1437
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:35,534
I never want to be the guy
holding you back.

1438
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:37,786
I want to be the one by your side.

1439
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:39,788
It won't always be easy,

1440
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:43,417
but I want to do whatever it takes
to make this work

1441
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,462
because that's what you do
when you love someone.

1442
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:50,174
And besides,
if we're gonna be together forever,

1443
01:38:50,799 --> 01:38:53,594
then four years of college
isn't such a big deal.

1444
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:57,640

Adler High School

1486
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:49,538
My whole life,

1487
01:42:49,621 --> 01:42:52,624
I've wanted the kind of love
you see in the movies.

1488

1489

hand in the back pocket

1490
01:42:59,089 --> 01:43:02,801
Boy meets girl, they break up and make up,

1491

1495

Because life is beautiful, and messy,
and never goes according to plan.

1496
01:43:19,484 --> 01:43:24,114
And the truth is, I have no idea
what it has in store for me.

1497
01:43:26,074 --> 01:43:32,748

is choosing each other through all of it,
