1
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,700
你可没说戒备会这么森严
You didn't tell me there'd be such security.

2
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,790
他们把飞机起飞的时间提前了
They moved the flight forward.

3
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,620
我们还是得按照计划进行
We'll have to go ahead as planned anyway.

4
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,050
托罗，听起来像只公牛
Toro? Sounds like a load of bull.

5
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,300
詹姆斯
James.

6
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,720
千万要小心点
Please, be careful.

7
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,670
看呐，世界可真小，你也叫托罗
Well, it's a small world. You're a Toro, too.

8
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,840
我们迈阿密见
I'll see you in Miami.

9
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,710
（燃料不足）

10
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,720
请加满油
Fill her up, please.

11
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,380
东柏林

12
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,800
（英国大使官邸）

13
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,010
大使先生，您的客人都到了
Your guests have arrived, Ambassador.

14
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,930
亲爱的，我们该出去了
We should go, my dear.

15
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,290
好嘛
Well...

16
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,460
你变得越来越漂亮了
You become more beautiful every day.

17
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,800
- 我在这呢 - 当然了，我知道
- I'm over here. - Of course you are.

18
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,260
这位是我的新助理，佩内洛普·斯摩本小姐
And this is Miss Penelope Smallbone, my new assistant.

19
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,390
斯摩本小姐
Miss Smallbone.

20
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,010
钱班霓，我还能说什么呢？
What can I say, Moneypenny?

21
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,390
除了说她是这么的迷人，就像...
Except that she is as attractive and as charming...

22
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,900
- 就像我以前那样？ - 我没有这么说
- As I used to be? - I didn't say that.

23
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,110
詹姆斯，你可真会哄人
You're such a flatterer, James.

24
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,900
钱班霓，从来都没有，以后也不会有像你这么吸引我的人
Moneypenny, you know there never has been and never will be anybody but you.

25
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,030
你已经说过了
So you've told me.

26
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,080
- 欢迎来到环球出口公司 - 收下吧，亲爱的
- Welcome to Universal Exports. - Take it, dear.

27
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,040
这是你唯一能从他那得到的东西
That's all you'll ever get from him.

28
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,870
谢谢你，邦德中校
Thank you, Commander Bond.

29
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
你认识我吗？
Do you know me?

30
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,790
钱班霓小姐和我说过你
Miss Moneypenny described you.

31
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,550
你干的坏事她都知道
In nauseating detail.

32
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,210
真的吗？
Really?

33
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,180
我觉得你很适合在这里工作
I can see you're going to fit in here very nicely.

34
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,720
- 早上好，007 - 早上好，长官
- Good morning, 007. - Morning, sir.

35
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,180
- 部长 - 中校
- Minister. - Commander.

36
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,440
你应该认识吉姆·范宁，我们的艺术品专家
I think you know Jim Fanning, our art expert.

37
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
- 是的，你好，吉姆 - 詹姆斯
- Yes. Hello, Jim. - James.

38
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,070
你知道这是什么吗？
Do you know what this is?

39
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,610
长官，看起来像是法贝热彩蛋
It looks like a Faberge egg, sir.

40
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,780
这是卡尔·法贝热为俄罗斯王室制作的众多宝石彩蛋之一
One of the jewelled eggs by Carl Faberge as a gift for the Russian royal family.

41
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,950
价值连城，并且非常稀有
They're priceless and very rare.

42
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,540
这里面有一个雕刻的皇室马车的模型
This one contains a model of the imperial state coach.

43
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,500
- 007，你说的很好 - 谢谢你，长官
- Top marks, 007. - Thank you, sir.

44
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,540
只不过这是个赝品
Except it's a fake.

45
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,840
真的是这个，今天下午会在苏富比拍卖行拍卖
There's the real thing. It's being auctioned at Sotheby's this afternoon.

46
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,760
这个是今年第四个要拍卖的宝石彩蛋
This is the fourth egg to turn up at auction this year.

47
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,060
这次拍卖很不寻常 匿名的卖家，秘密的瑞士银行账户
It's from none of the usual sources. Anonymous seller, Swiss bank account.

48
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,020
我敢说卖家肯定是个俄国人
I'd say that the vendor was a Russian.

49
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,310
这个时候，它出现了
And now this turns up.

50
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,560
一个几乎可以乱真的赝品
A near-perfect forgery.

51
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,610
我觉得邦德中校应该和你一起去拍卖会
I think Commander Bond should accompany you to the sale.

52
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,860
这样就太好了，我正好需要一个助手
Splendid. I could use an extra pair of eyes.

53
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,320
我们可以去查一下卖家是谁
We could try and spot the seller.

54
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,200
他们通常都会表现的毫无兴趣或者趁机推高价格
They usually turn up out of interest or perhaps just to bump up the price.

55
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,580
谢谢你，范宁
Thank you, Fanning.

56
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,750
别客气
Not at all.

57
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,000
如果卖家是俄国人，这很可能是为海外情报活动
If it is the Russians, it may be an effort to raise currency

58
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,010
筹集资金，或者是为了偿还债务
for covert operations abroad or for payoffs.

59
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,590
无论如何，我们最好查出他们要干什么
Either way, we'd better find out what they're up to.

60
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,010
- 是，部长 - 007这是机密文件
- Yes, Minister. - Eyes only, 007.

61
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,140
“寻宝行动”
Operation Trove.

62
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,350
你会接替009的职务
You'll be replacing 009.

63
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,360
他在东德被杀，死的时候手里就拿着那枚彩蛋
He turned up dead in East Germany with that egg in his hand.

64
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,320
这就是全部线索了
There's not much to go on.

65
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,610
长官，我们还有一条线索
Well, we do have one lead, Minister.

66
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,110
“女士的藏品”
"Property of a Lady."

67
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,000
下一个议题是商讨与北约进行互相裁军的谈判条件
Next on the agenda is the continuing mutual disarmament talks with NATO.

68
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,670
我想你们应该都看过果戈理将军的报告了
I assume you've all read General Gogol's report.

69
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,420
里面写得非常详细
It seems very thorough.

70
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,380
谢谢你，主席同志
Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

71
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,260
我想我的观点已经表达的非常清楚了
I believe I express the opinion of everyone present

72
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,890
采用北约的方案并不会损害我们国家的国防体系
that adoption of NATO proposals does not compromise our defensive position.

73
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,150
- 主席同志 - 奥尔洛夫将军
- Comrade Chairman. - General Orlov.

74
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,230
果戈理将军真是太放肆了
General Gogol is presumptuous.

75
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,570
他的话只能代表他自己
He speaks for himself and others

76
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:55,580
还有那些无能之辈，这是不切实际的政策
who cling to timid, outdated and unrealistic policies.

77
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,080
我必须得提醒你们一下
Must I remind you, the committee,

78
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,210
在我们决定接受北约的裁军条件之前
of our overwhelming superiority over NATO forces

79
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,170
我们对他们有绝对优势
before we give it away?

80
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,390
我在东德可以直接调动的军队
In East Germany under my direct command,

81
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,230
一共有31个师，包括11个装甲师
I have 31 divisions, including 11 tank divisions

82
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,110
捷克斯洛伐克还有五个装甲师
and another five in Czechoslovakia.

83
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,200
作为支援，在俄罗斯西部边界还有60个师的兵力
In support, on the Russian western border are 60 divisions,

84
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,700
包括22个装甲师
including 22 tank divisions.

85
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,910
我们有十比一的优势
In all, a 10-1 advantage.

86
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:48,800
美国和西德军方最多只能动员十个装甲师的兵力
American and West German forces can field at most ten armoured divisions.

87
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,930
英国只是维持象征性的兵力
The British maintain only a token force.

88
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,310
我们已经用最新型的库图佐夫计算机进行了多次沙盘推演
We have played out a variety of attack strategies on the new Kutuzov computer

89
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,400
结论是从北方以十个师的兵力发起突然袭击
and find that a lightning thrust by ten armoured divisions from the north,

90
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:13,320
另外五个装甲师从捷克进攻，不管他们如何防御
and by five more through Czechoslovakia, lead to total victory in five days

91
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,580
五天之内我们就会取得全面胜利
against any possible defence scenario.

92
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,000
这简直是太疯狂了
This is absolute madness.

93
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,040
我们都知道这样做的后果
We know where it will end.

94
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,920
北约会使用核武器发起反击
NATO will counterattack with nuclear weapons.

95
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,460
绝对不会
Never.

96
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,090
西方世界腐败而又分裂
The West is decadent and divided.

97
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,800
他们不敢去承担受到我方核反击的风险
It has no stomach to risk our atomic reprisals.

98
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,180
在欧洲每天都有抗议者要求单方面放弃使用核武器
Throughout Europe, daily demonstrations demand unilateral nuclear disarmament.

99
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,810
我们没有必要去为了
I see no reason to risk war

100
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,480
你个人的狂热和好战而冒险去发动战争
to satisfy your personal paranoia and thirst for conquest.

101
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,200
我们必须得先处理国内的一系列紧急问题
We must turn our energies to pressing domestic problems.

102
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,200
- 果戈理将军，我提醒你一下... - 同志们，坐下
- General Gogol, let me remind you... - Comrades, sit down.

103
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,910
- 我告诉你... - 你们两个都是
- I wish to tell you... - Both of you.

104
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,830
全球社会主义要依靠和平手段来实现
World socialism will be achieved peaceably.

105
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,790
我们的军事力量是防卫性的
Our military role is strictly defensive.

106
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,880
奥尔洛夫将军，你明白吗
Is that understood, General Orlov?

107
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,140
果戈理将军，你可以继续了
General Gogol, would you continue?

108
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,810
谢谢你，主席同志，接下来我要说一下报告中的重点内容
Thank you, Comrade Chairman. I will now turn to the specifics of my report...

109
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,440
- 你去告诉他，我马上就会过去 - 是，将军
- Tell him I will be there as quickly as possible. - Yes, General.

110
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,800
（克林姆林宫艺术品仓库）

111
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,250
求你了...
Please. Please.

112
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,840
- 我要集中精力 - 雷肯
- I am trying to concentrate. - Lenkin.

113
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,880
- 怎么了？ - 将军同志，我们遇到麻烦了
- What is it? - It's terrible news, Comrade General.

114
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,430
那个复制品在运输过程中被偷了
The reproduction has been stolen in transit.

115
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,220
那个窃贼已经解决了，但是彩蛋掉进河里丢了
The thief was dealt with, but the egg was lost in the river.

116
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,190
你的无能会害死我们所有人
Your incompetence will destroy us all.

117
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,940
- 那就再做一个复制品 - 将军同志，我们没有时间了
- We'll have a replacement made. - There is no time, Comrade General.

118
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,150
我刚刚收到消息，两天之后就要不定期清点库存了
I have just been informed of an unscheduled inventory in two days.

119
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,990
雷肯，冷静点
Control yourself, Lenkin.

120
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,660
我会通知我们在伦敦的人，我们一定会找回彩蛋的
I'll tell our London people, we must have the genuine egg back.

121
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,370
希望能及时联络到他们
I hope we can reach them in time.

122
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,210
布索尼得标
Sold to Busoni.

123
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,430
下一件是48号
The next lot is number 48.

124
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,220
由名匠卡尔·法贝热为东方皇帝制作的绿金彩蛋
A superb green-gold Imperial Easter egg by Carl Faberge.

125
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,980
内部是透明绿色的珐琅，被黄金做成的枝叶所环绕
Enamelled in translucent green, enclosed by gold laurel-leaf trellis.

126
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,150
上面点缀着蓝色的宝石和四朵镶钻的黄金花
Set with blue sapphires and four petalled gold flowers with diamonds.

127
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,480
这东西能值多少钱？
How much should it fetch?

128
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,490
25到30万英镑，再高的话就疯了
£250-300, 000. Anything more'd be crazy.

129
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,030
...1897年，它被尼古拉斯沙皇使用过
...used by Tsar Nicholas in 1897 in Moscow.

130
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,910
“女士的藏品”
Property of a Lady.

131
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,540
看呐，这里的女士可真不少
Well, there are quite a few ladies here.

132
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,540
她不必亲自来这里，她可以让一个委托人代表她来
She wouldn't have to be here in person. She could be represented by proxy.

133
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,880
底价15万英镑，开始
I'll start it at £150, 000.

134
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,800
15万，16万
150, 60.

135
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,720
17万，17万
170. 170.

136
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,970
18万 19万
180.190.

137
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,930
20万，女士，他出价比你高
200. Against you, madam.

138
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,690
- 还有人出价吗？ - 那里有位女士
- Any more? - Now there is a lady.

139
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,610
22万英镑
£220, 000.

140
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,110
24万
240.

141
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,490
詹姆斯，多注意点拍卖的情况
James, stick to the business in hand.

142
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,280
26万
£260, 000.

143
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,490
28万
280.

144
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,200
30万英镑
£300, 000.

145
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,240
下面开始加两万
And 20?

146
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,750
先生，你要出价吗？
Are you bidding, sir?

147
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,300
32万，又有人出价了
£320,000. New bidder.

148
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,640
- 这可真有趣 - 你认识他吗？
- That's interesting. - You know him?

149
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,140
卡马尔·汗，通常是卖家
Kamal Khan. Usually a seller.

150
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,940
来历不明，勉强算是上层人士
Marginal quality from dubious sources.

151
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,810
38万英镑
£380, 000.

152
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,980
- 中间的男士出价40万 - 应该可以成交了
- 400 in the centre. - Well, that should do it.

153
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,610
- 卡马尔出了最高价 - 先生，你出价40万英镑
- Kamal has gone over the top. - Your bid, sir. 400, 000.

154
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,870
40万，还有出价更高的吗？
400, 000. Any more?

155
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,330
42.5万，又有人出价了
425. New bidder.

156
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,330
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir.

157
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,330
- 42.5万 - 你疯了吗？
- 425. - Have you gone mad?

158
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,670
我要看看他到底有多想买它
Let's see how badly he wants it.

159
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
45万
450.

160
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
45万，还有更高的吗？
450. 475?

161
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,260
45万，还有更高的吗？
The bid is 450. 475?

162
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,690
先生，那位先生的出价比您高
Against you, sir. No more than 450.

163
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,400
- 吉姆 - 最高价是45万英镑
- Jim? - The bid is £450, 000.

164
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,530
有人出价47.5万
I have 475.

165
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,370
50万英镑
£500,000.

166
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,380
最高价是50万英镑，还有更高的吗？
I have half a million pounds. All done?

167
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,420
还有更高的吗？
Any more?

168
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,010
先生，成交，50万英镑
Yours, sir, for £500, 000.

169
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,390
- 下一件拍品是... - 我们差点就要买下它了
- The next lot is... - We could have been stuck with it.

170
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,810
- 不会的，他一定会买它 - 为什么
- I doubt it. He had to buy it. - But why?

171
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,690
这就是我们要去查的事
That's what I intend to find out.

172
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,890
你没有权力出价去买那个彩蛋
You had no business bidding for that egg.

173
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,350
万一真的把它买下了，你想怎么办
What would you have done if you'd got it?

174
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,190
长官，我会说那是假的，然后拒绝付款
I would have claimed it was a fake, sir, and not paid.

175
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,610
拒绝付款
Not paid?

176
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,450
真的在我手上，我在拍卖会上把它调包了
Here's the original. I switched it with the fake during the auction.

177
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,200
天呐
Good God.

178
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,540
万一卖家发现了他买到的是赝品怎么办？
And what happens when the buyer discovers that?

179
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,540
如果是正常的买家，就会提出申诉
Well, he complains. If he's legitimate.

180
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,920
- 然后呢？ - 但是我觉得他不会提出申诉
- Well? - I don't think he will complain.

181
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,170
范宁和我说卡马尔通常是卖家，但这次他是买家
According to Fanning, this Kamal usually sells. Now he buys.

182
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,050
那个赝品会让他露出马脚
I believe that the fake will smoke him out.

183
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,470
我们的人跟踪他到了希思罗机场，他坐飞机去了新德里
Our tail followed him to Heathrow where he caught a plane to Delhi.

184
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,600
你也要去那里
You must go there, too.

185
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,060
我会通知印度分局的沙鲁丁，他会帮你去监视他
I'll alert Sadruddin, our man in Station I, to keep him under surveillance.

186
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,900
你坐下一班飞机去印度
Book yourself on the next flight out.

187
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,650
是，长官，我就剩55分钟了
Well, I've 55 minutes to catch it, sir.

188
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,320
- 邦德 - 长官
- Oh, Bond? - Sir?

189
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,240
走之前签一张通行证
Sign a chit for that egg before you go.

190
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,580
它现在是政府的财产了
It's government property now.

191
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,830
好的，长官
Of course, sir.

192
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,820
这首曲子不错，你收英镑吗？
Charming tune. You do take English money?

193
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,400
我只收一磅的金币
Only gold sovereigns.

194
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,570
请帮我拿一下
Please.

195
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,160
我叫维贾伊，是环球出口公司的特别采购员
I'm Vijay. Special expediter, Universal Exports.

196
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,910
- 邦德中校，欢迎来到印度 - 谢谢你，叫我詹姆斯就行
- Welcome to India, Commander Bond. - Thank you. Call me James.

197
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,080
- 沙鲁丁呢？ - 在那边，他在计程车里等你呢
- Where's Sadruddin? - Over here. Waiting in the taxi.

198
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,000
- 这种穿着不太合适 - 我讨厌蛇
- This was the wrong cover. - I hate snakes.

199
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,500
这是计程车，请坐下吧
Taxi. Please be comfortable.

200
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,590
- 邦德中校，我是沙鲁丁，印度分局的局长 - 你好啊
- Commander Bond, I am Sadruddin, Head of Section. - How do you do?

201
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,640
- 我已经给你定好酒店了 - 很好 我的行李呢
- I booked you in at the Shivnivas Hotel. - Good. My luggage?

202
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,100
已经送过去了
Gone ahead.

203
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,610
卡马尔·汗是个什么人？
What can you tell me about Kamal Khan?

204
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,240
被放逐的阿富汗王子，喜欢打马球、板球和网球
Exiled Afghan prince. Sportsman - polo, cricket, tennis.

205
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,860
- 我也会打一点网球 - 真的吗
- I play a bit myself. - Really?

206
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,530
事实上，我是卡马尔的俱乐部里的一名兼职网球运动员
As a matter of fact, I've got a part-time job as a pro at Kamal's club.

207
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,210
- 你学的怎么样？ - 我的反手拍进步了
- What have you learned so far? - My backhand's improved.

208
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,800
卡马尔的豪宅就在山顶上
Kamal lives there on the hill.

209
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,880
季风宫殿，那里守卫森严
The Monsoon Palace. It's heavily guarded.

210
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,550
我怎么才能见到他？
How do I get to him?

211
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,140
他差不多每天的下午和晚上都会在酒店的赌场里玩双陆棋
He plays backgammon most afternoon and evening at the hotel casino.

212
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,970
你是酒店的房客，所以也有会员的资格
As a guest, you're automatically a member.

213
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:49,230
- 我们一会儿在那里见面 - 我先去换身衣服
- Let's meet there later. - I'll change into something less casual.

214
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,270
给你这个，你玩蛇的时候可能会用到它
Here, you may need this to play with your asp.

215
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,960
早上好，我叫邦德，在这里预订了房间
Good morning. Name's Bond. I believe you have a reservation.

216
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,170
- 我们正在等您呢 - 很好
- We've been expecting you. - Good.

217
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,590
希望您在这里能玩的愉快
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

218
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,630
我想我会的
I'm sure I will.

219
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,260
谢谢你
Thank you.

220
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,100
先生，您的行李已经整理好了
Your luggage has been unpacked, sir.

221
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,810
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

222
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,360
如果您有需要可以叫我
If I can be of further assistance...

223
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,070
- 您还有事吗？ - 没有了
- Anything at all? - Maybe later.

224
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,460
- 怎么样了？ - 少校也不是新手
- How's he doing? - The Major's no novice.

225
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,920
但是卡马尔已经赢了20万卢比了
But Kamal has won 200,000 rupees.

226
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,300
这回你可赢不了了吧
You'll have a job beating this.

227
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,930
我今天手气很好，要加倍吗？
I feel lucky. Shall we double?

228
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,300
当然要
Of course.

229
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,600
两万卢比
20,000 rupees.

230
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,770
- 怎么每次你出的时候都是豹子 - 总是这样
- Damn, always a double six when you need it. - Always.

231
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,360
- 你是怎么做到的 - 全靠手腕功夫
- How do you do it. - It's all in the wrist.

232
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,200
- 我就做不到 - 少校，要再来一局吗？
- It's hopeless. - Shall we have another game, Major?

233
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,820
- 一样的 - 好，再来一局
- Same stake? - Yes, I'll have another go.

234
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,540
你的好运气总会用完的
Your luck's got to run out some time.

235
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,920
能一起喝一杯吗
May I join you?

236
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,630
苏富比拍卖行 50万英镑
Sotheby's. Half a million pounds?

237
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,800
- 你是拍卖会上的那个人 - 没错
- The man at the auction. - Precisely.

238
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,010
你对人的面相的记性不错
You have a good memory for faces.

239
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,180
还有身材
And figures.

240
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,100
- 这不是巧合吧 - 没错
- This can't be a coincidence. - No.

241
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,690
- 你想喝点什么？ - 不用了，谢谢你
- What will you have? - Nothing, thank you.

242
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,690
下次见面时会愿意吗？
Some other time, perhaps?

243
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,280
谢谢你
Thank you.

244
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,990
七点
Six and one.

245
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,910
- 怎么样 - 看起来上校会赢
- Well? - Looks like the Major has got him.

246
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,880
少校，让我们玩得再刺激点吧
Why don't we make it interesting, Major?

247
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,630
加注到10万卢比怎么样
Double to 100, 000 rupees.

248
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,350
我不玩了，你的运气太好了
I can't accept. Not with your luck.

249
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,600
你赢了
You win.

250
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,350
如果是我，我就会继续加注
I would have taken that double, myself.

251
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,690
那您为什么不接替少校来试一下呢？您是...
Then why don't you take over the Major's position? Mr... ?

252
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,860
邦德
Bond.

253
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,660
詹姆斯·邦德，谢谢，我很愿意试一下
James Bond. Thank you, I'd be delighted.

254
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,280
赌注是10万卢比
100, 000 rupees, then.

255
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,120
十二点
Double six.

256
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,540
想要战胜这个可不是太容易，你说呢？
Not such a good double to accept, after all, was it?

257
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,640
- 再加一倍 - 好的
- Double. - Of course.

258
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,720
你得再掷出十二点才能赢
You can only win with a double six.

259
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,850
赌注是20万卢比
The stake is 200, 000 rupees.

260
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,440
你有现金吗？
Do you have the cash?

261
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,360
我想这个东西应该够了吧
Well, I think that this should be ample security.

262
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,820
你说呢？
Don't you?

263
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,710
请吧，邦德先生
Play, Mr Bond.

264
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,920
你得需要十足的好运气才能做到
You'll need a great deal of luck to get out of this.

265
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,010
运气
Oh, luck?

266
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,550
我想我应该沾沾你的手气
Well, then I shall use player's privilege,

267
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,510
用一下你的幸运骰子
and use your lucky dice.

268
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,600
全凭手腕功夫
It's all in the wrist.

269
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,150
十二点
Double sixes.

270
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,980
真想不到
Fancy that.

271
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,940
20万卢比
200, 000 rupees.

272
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,410
我要现金
I prefer cash.

273
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,670
- 换成现金给他 - 是，先生
- Get it cashed for him. - Yes, sir.

274
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,840
邦德先生，快去把钱花完吧
Spend the money quickly, Mr Bond.

275
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,970
卡马尔·汗，我正有此意
I intend to, Kamal Khan.

276
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,020
这是我的护身符
My security.

277
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,480
这是你的吗？
And yours?

278
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,370
看到了吗，也不全是凭手腕功夫
It's not really in the wrist, you know.

279
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,590
我应该去跟踪他们吗？
Should I be following them?

280
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,090
是的，不过我想他们会跟随这个而来的
Yes, but I think they'll be following this.

281
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,390
谢谢你
Thank you.

282
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,430
维贾伊会继续留在这里
Vijay will take you from here.

283
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,270
我会去查查卡马尔的底细
I'll see if I can find out more about Kamal.

284
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,730
很好，这个你拿着
Good. Hold on to these, will you?

285
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,020
这些应该够你买好几个月的咖喱了
Keep you in curry for a few weeks, won't it?

286
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,690
谢谢你，花天酒地的生活真好
Thank you. It's a wonderful racket, this.

287
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,810
维贾伊，我们有伴了
Vijay, we have company.

288
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,730
别担心，这是咱们公司的车
No problem. This is a company car.

289
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,870
从这下去
Step on it.

290
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,290
这样应该能甩掉他们了
This should shake 'em off.

291
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,660
多亏了这笔现金
Thank God for hard currency.

292
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,050
球赛结束，詹姆斯，坐稳了
Game, set and match. Hang on, James.

293
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,570
把头低下
Keep your head down.

294
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,000
谢谢你
Thank you.

295
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,430
（滚下我的床）

296
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,050
给你，接着吧
Here. Catch.

297
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,390
借用一下
Excuse me.

298
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,150
谢谢你，你还是自己把它吞回去吧
Thank you. You'd better stick this back yourself.

299
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,200
詹姆斯，到这来，快上车
James, over here. Come on.

300
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,050
维贾伊，我给你的钱呢
Vijay. The money I gave you.

301
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,140
有钞票了
Here. Rupees!

302
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,770
来的容易，花的也容易
Easy come, easy go.

303
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,630
这广告还真的有点用
It pays to advertise.

304
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,800
詹姆斯，这边走
This way, James.

305
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,190
Q
Ah, Q.

306
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,230
- 你好啊 - 大部分我不开心的时候都是因为你
- How are you? - Most unhappy, 007, thanks to you.

307
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,240
我怎么才能高质量的去完成工作呢
How can I be expected to maintain the quality of my work?

308
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,120
我接到命令就赶过来了，连设备都没有
Sent out here at a moment's notice.

309
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,750
你这里有细线吗？有人把刀刺进了我的钱包里
Have you any smaller thread? Someone stuck a knife in my wallet.

310
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,210
没刺中你，真是可惜
They missed you. What a pity.

311
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,960
凯伦，这个就麻烦你一下吧
Karen, see to that, will you?

312
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,420
我把我的枪也弄丢了
I've also mislaid my PPK.

313
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,550
- 还弄丢什么了？ - 就这些
- Anything else? - No, that's all.

314
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,020
该死
Blast.

315
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,060
Q，你没办法让它坚挺吗？
Having problems keeping it up, Q?

316
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,850
这个还在实验阶段
Experimental model.

317
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,110
- 你好啊，史密瑟斯 - 中校
- Hello, Smithers. - Commander.

318
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,870
- 真了不起 - 过来吧，我有东西要给你
- Smashing, Q. - Come on. I have a few things for you.

319
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,330
史密瑟斯，非常好
Very nice, Smithers.

320
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,380
Q，追踪器准备好了吗
Is the homing device ready yet, Q?

321
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,420
不只是追踪器
Not only a homing device

322
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,710
还有一个非常精密的麦克风
but an extremely delicate microphone as well.

323
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,090
就这样放进去
It goes in there like that.

324
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,640
现在注意，这是一支钢笔
Now, take a fountain pen.

325
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,350
转动笔套
Twist the top,

326
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,850
在这支笔的内部装有浓度非常高的王水
and a highly concentrated mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid.

327
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,110
- 可以融化所有金属 - 很适合毒死作家
- Dissolves all metals. - Wonderful for poison-pen letters.

328
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,280
007，专心点
Pay attention, 007.

329
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,240
把笔帽顶端摘下来
Pull the top off the pen.

330
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,660
用这个非常灵敏的耳机，你可以收听到窃听器的声音
With this ultrasensitive earpiece, you can listen in on the bug.

331
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,370
这个追踪器可以和你手表上的无线电测距仪相匹配
The homing device is compatible with the radio directional finder in your watch.

332
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,790
如果你没把手表弄丢的话
If you haven't lost it.

333
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,880
非常好，Q，它在工作
That's amazing, Q. It does work.

334
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,930
那是什么？
What's that?

335
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,600
那是最新型的液晶电视
That's the latest liquid-crystal TV.

336
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,730
非常精巧
Very handy.

337
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,740
Q，图像很漂亮
Perfect image, Q.

338
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,460
007
Really, 007.

339
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,290
听着，我没时间去陪你玩这些幼稚的游戏
Look, I haven't time for these adolescent antics.

340
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,630
- 中校，我们只能做成这样了 - 非常漂亮，谢谢你
- It's the best we can do, commander. - It's beautiful. Thank you.

341
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,340
好了，你可以走了，我还有工作要做
Go on, get along. I've got my work to do.

342
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,390
- Q，我可以留下帮忙 - 谢谢你
- I'll give you a hand, Q. - Thank you.

343
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,180
别忘了这个
Don't forget this.

344
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,270
别让他那些坏习惯把你带坏了
Don't let him teach you any of his bad habits.

345
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,030
邦德先生，您的座位准备好了
Mr Bond, your table is ready.

346
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,700
- 我没有订座位 - 先生，您的客人在等您
- I didn't reserve one. - Your guest is waiting, sir.

347
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,460
这边请
This way, please.

348
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,540
谢谢你
Thank you.

349
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,630
你是改主意了吗？
You changed your mind.

350
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,260
- 我很高兴 - 是吗？
- I'm glad. - Are you?

351
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,260
好吧，这么说吧
Well, let's put it this way.

352
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:21,680
到目前为止，你是卡马尔的朋友中对我最友好的一个
So far, you are the least lethal and by far the prettiest of Kamal's friends.

353
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,390
谢谢你
Thank you.

354
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,860
这次见面是他让你来的还是你自己来的
So does he have a proposition for me, or do you?

355
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,860
他想和你做个交易
He suggests a trade.

356
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,030
用彩蛋换你的小命
The egg for your life.

357
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,160
我早就听说彩蛋的价格涨了很多，但这是不是太高了点？
I'd heard the price of eggs was going up, but isn't that a little high?

358
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,370
把账单计入几号房间
Charge it to Room ...

359
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,460
27号房间，香槟也一起算进去
Oh, 27. Along with the champagne, I suppose?

360
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,550
我会把它放到桌子上
I'll leave it at the desk.

361
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
你不介意吗？
You don't mind?

362
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,510
为什么？卡马尔·汗已经忘了我的长相了吗？
Why? Has Kamal forgotten what I look like already?

363
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,010
是我想要
It's for me.

364
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,930
所以说万一哪天我突然死了
So that if I depart this world suddenly,

365
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,690
你就有东西可以来怀念我了，对吗？
you'll have something to remember me by?

366
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,070
差不多就是这样
Something like that.

367
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,490
它会放进我的剪贴簿里，我会收集回忆
It's for my scrapbook. I collect memories.

368
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,080
那我们就来制造一些回忆吧
Well, let's get on with making a few.

369
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,360
我还想再来一杯
I need refilling.

370
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,280
当然可以
Of course you do.

371
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,120
我再去拿一瓶
I'll get some more.

372
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,620
不必麻烦了，我们来喝个交杯酒吧
Don't bother. We'll make yours a loving cup.

373
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,580
真是个好主意
What a good idea.

374
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,010
请原谅我的好奇心，这是什么？
Forgive my curiosity, but what is that?

375
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,720
这是我的小章鱼
That's my little octopussy.

376
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,410
早上好
Good morning.

377
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,700
早上好
Morning.

378
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,910
我不想吵醒你，但是既然你已经醒了
I didn't want to wake you. But since you're up,

379
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,040
我就可以亲口和你说再见了
I can say a proper goodbye.

380
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,920
现在几点了
What is the time?

381
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,350
风景很美，不是吗？
Beautiful view, isn't it?

382
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,400
- 我不知道要怎么去说再见 - 行动比语言更好
- I don't know how to say goodbye. - Actions speak louder than words.

383
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,150
一点没错
So right.

384
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,940
一 二 一 二
In. Out. In. Out.

385
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,200
加油，姑娘们
Come on, girls. In. Out.

386
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,450
收起船桨
Check oars.

387
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,200
我们已经找回彩蛋了
The egg has been recovered.

388
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,240
你应该高兴的
You should be pleased .

389
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:15,000
在它第一次被偷走之后我就很不高兴
I'm not pleased it was stolen in the first place.

390
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,870
就更别说窃贼已经知道它和我们有关系了
Nor that the thief knows enough to bring it here.

391
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,500
他显然是个喜欢冒险的人，想用这个来要挟我们
He's obviously an adventurer with possible blackmail on his mind.

392
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,800
反正现在他已经被带到季风宫殿了
Anyway, I have him as my guest at the Monsoon Palace.

393
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,890
他很快就会说出他到底知道什么
And he will tell us all he knows very quickly.

394
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,430
- 他到底是谁？ - 一个英国人
- Who is he? - Englishman.

395
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,850
喜欢彩蛋，由其是法贝热的
Likes eggs. Preferably Faberge.

396
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,650
还有色子，尤其是是灌了铅的
And dice. Preferably loaded.

397
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,690
他叫詹姆斯·邦德
His name is James Bond.

398
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,690
把他带到这里来
Bring him here.

399
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:51,370
他是个很危险的人，在他招供之后，我们必须除掉他
He's dangerous. After he's talked, we must get rid of him immediately.

400
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,370
不行
No.

401
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,920
我想你应该是不会把“不行”改成“行”的
A "no" from you has little chance of becoming a "yes".

402
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,840
所以本次谈话就到此结束吧
I assume, therefore, that the meeting is over.

403
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,420
但是你正在犯一个很严重的错误
But you're making a serious mistake.

404
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,510
到目前为止 这里的服务品质都非常的好
Well, so far I can't complain about the valet service.

405
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,470
晚上8点吃晚饭
Dinner. 8 o'clock.

406
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,130
- 晚上好，邦德先生 - 晚上好
- Good evening, Mr Bond. - Good evening.

407
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,920
休息好了吗？
Well rested?

408
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:15,220
你和玛格达小姐应该已经见过面了
I believe you and Miss Magda have met.

409
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,310
- 见面的时候我非常高兴 - 你太客气了
- It was a pleasure. - You're too kind.

410
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,400
可以开始用餐了吗？蛋奶酥可不能再等了
You don't mind if we start? The souffle can't wait.

411
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,650
请允许我在晚餐的时候问一个不太合适的问题
At the risk of appearing to be making light dinner conversation,

412
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,450
我为什么会在这里？
may I ask exactly why I am here?

413
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,490
我是说，你已经拿到彩蛋了
I mean, after all, you do have the egg.

414
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:44,120
没错，但是我们还没有统一的答案
True. But we don't have all the answers.

415
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,920
好吧，如果有争论的话，我不会说话的
Well, supposing, for argument's sake, I don't feel like talking?

416
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,300
别担心，你会说的
Don't worry, you will.

417
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:55,930
让我猜猜看
Let me guess.

418
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,510
夹棍，还有烙铁
Thumbscrews and hot coals.

419
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:03,180
不是，我们的方法比那可要复杂多了
Hardly. We're much more sophisticated than that.

420
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,860
- 硫喷妥钠 - 那太粗鲁了 并且很不可靠
- Sodium Pentothal? - A bit crude. Very unreliable.

421
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:16,280
我们更喜欢混有强效迷幻剂的箭毒
We prefer curare with an effective psychedelic compound.

422
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,200
保证会有效
Guaranteed results.

423
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,540
- 但是脑部会造成永久性伤害 - 很不幸的副作用
- But with permanent brain damage. - An unfortunate side effect.

424
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,790
这是我们的名菜之一
One of our specialities.

425
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,790
馅料酿羊头
Stuffed sheep's head.

426
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:43,350
很奇怪 当我被盯着看的时候什么食欲都没有
It's odd, but when I'm stared at I seem to lose my appetite.

427
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:01,570
对了，谢谢你的晚饭
Oh, thank you for dinner.

428
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,990
那么就明天再见了
Until tomorrow, then.

429
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:16,010
- 好了，我也要说再见了 - 我还可以再喝一杯
- Well, I'll say good night. - I could come in for a nightcap.

430
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,680
或许改天的吧
Some other time, perhaps.

431
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,190
你想进来喝一杯酒吗，不必了
I don't suppose you'd care for a nightcap? No.

432
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,290
我想您这一路上肯定很愉快
I trust you had a pleasant flight.

433
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,630
请跟我来，我们已经把所有东西都准备好了
If you step this way, I think you will find everything is in order.

434
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,170
卡马尔·汗，你们的工匠的手艺可真是不错
Congratulations on the quality of your workmanship, Kamal Khan.

435
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,710
谢谢你，奥尔洛夫将军
Thank you, General Orlov.

436
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,050
您可以看到 它每一处的尺寸都是严格的按照
As you can see, each piece has been meticulously duplicated

437
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,560
雷肯给我们的数据复制的
according to Lenkin's specifications.

438
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:57,560
很好，把它放到直升机上去
Good. Have it put aboard the helicopter.

439
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,650
- 能信任他们吗？ - 我保证他们会守口如瓶的
- Can they be trusted? - I assure you of their silence.

440
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,620
我们两个人都下了极大的赌注
We are both playing for enormous stakes.

441
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,580
我会得到我想要的
I get what I want

442
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,540
你也会得到真的珠宝
then you get the genuine jewellery.

443
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,040
没错
Exactly...

444
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,780
精准的时间控制非常重要
The precise timing will be essential.

445
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,110
记住，任何事情都不能改变计划
Remember: nothing must be changed.

446
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,000
一周之后的今天，在东德的马克思市
One week from today, in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

447
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,670
- 马克思市 - 没错
- Karl-Marx-Stadt. - Correct.

448
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:25,730
- 事情都办好了吗？ - 都按您的吩咐办好了
- Everything taken care of? - As you ordered, Excellence.

449
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:31,900
- 你又找回彩蛋了？ - 是从一个窃贼的手中找到的
- So, you recovered it? - From an accomplice of the thief.

450
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:35,200
马上把他杀掉
He must be eliminated at once.

451
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,950
不能再有任何安全上的问题
There must be no further security breach.

452
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,290
这个假的已经引起不少麻烦了
This fake has caused enough trouble.

453
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,000
我得走了
I must go.

454
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,140
我对你的表现非常满意
Everything has been most satisfactory.

455
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:04,480
奥尔洛夫将军，您太客气了
Most kind, General Orlov.

456
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,940
杀了邦德
Get Bond.

457
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,750
那个英国人跑了
The Englishman has escaped.

458
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,550
他跑不远的，我们会抓到他的
He won't go very far. We'll track him.

459
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,550
很好
Good.

460
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,850
让我们来运动一下吧
Let the sport commence.

461
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,140
快拦住他
Head him off.

462
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,070
坐下
Sit!

463
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,420
找到他了
We have him.

464
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,380
围住他，他在那里
Go round. He's in there.

465
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:33,660
不要出声
Hiss off.

466
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:01,590
不要让他跑了
Don't let him get away.

467
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,580
过来，老兄，快过来
C'mom, buddy, c'mon.

468
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:44,500
- 哥们，你还好吗 - 我很好
- Hey, you all right, buddy? - I'm fine.

469
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,330
你是我们这个团的吗？
Are you with our group?

470
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,920
不是，女士，我是经济团的
No, ma'am. I'm with the economy tour.

471
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,850
邦德先生真是个非常罕见的人
Mr Bond is indeed a very rare breed.

472
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,520
不过马上就要死了
Soon to be made extinct.

473
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,610
属于蓝圈章鱼
Genus Hapalochlaena.

474
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,660
它的毒液在数秒钟之内就可致人死亡
Produces a venom that's invariably fatal in seconds.

475
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,620
游艇上就有这种旗帜
The barge had that sign.

476
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:18,330
是的，那艘游艇属于一个住在水上宫殿的女富豪
Yes. It belongs to a wealthy woman who lives on the floating palace.

477
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:19,910
这个女人是谁？
Who is she?

478
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,580
没有人知道她的真实姓名，人们都叫她八爪女
No one knows her real name, but she's known as Octopussy.

479
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,960
我听卡马尔说过这个名字
That's the name I heard at Kamal's.

480
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:31,420
我听说整个岛上都是美女，不允许男人进入
I hear that island's full of beautiful women. No men allowed.

481
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:34,510
真的吗，性别歧视
Really? Sexual discrimination.

482
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,890
我一定要亲自去看一下
I'll definitely have to pay it a visit.

483
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,900
晚上好
Good evening.

484
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,240
我正在想你什么时候会来呢
I wondered when you might arrive.

485
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,910
所以你就是神秘的八爪女.
So you are the mysterious Octopussy.

486
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:19,160
你就是詹姆斯·邦德
And you are James Bond.

487
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,580
编号007，可以合法杀人
007, licensed to kill.

488
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,120
我是你今天晚上的目标吗？
Am I to be your target for tonight?

489
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:27,420
不确定
Not necessarily.

490
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,050
那要看你能告诉我多少关于珠宝走私的事
Depends how much you tell me about jewellery smuggling.

491
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:36,260
还有为什么我们的特工会在东柏林被杀
And why one of our agents was killed in East Berlin.

492
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,390
我不知道这件事
I know nothing about that.

493
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,970
你还记得德克斯特·斯迈思少校吗？
You remember Major Dexter Smythe?

494
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,100
被派去抓捕他的人就是你，对吗？
You were sent out to arrest him, weren't you?

495
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,730
看来你了解的事还真不少
You seem to have done your homework.

496
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,570
谢谢，我记得，斯迈思从军队退役之后加入了英国情报部门
Thank you. Yes. Smythe, after a brilliant military career, joined our secret service.

497
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:58,150
他的任务是找出落入朝鲜手中的一批中国金条
His mission was to recover a cache of Chinese gold, seized in North Korea.

498
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,570
他和他在当地的向导都失踪了
Both he and his native guide disappeared.

499
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,660
黄金也没有找到
The gold was never found.

500
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:08,210
二十年之后，你被派去抓捕他
And 20 years later you were sent after him.

501
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:15,260
后来向导的尸体被找到了，头骨里有一枚斯迈思枪里的子弹
The guide's body turned up with a bullet still in his skull from Smythe's revolver.

502
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:18,380
我追踪斯迈思到了斯里兰卡
I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,

503
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,680
在我带他回去之前，我给了他24小时去处理好自己的事
and gave him 24 hours to clear up his affairs before I took him back.

504
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:26,850
他宁愿选择自杀也不愿意去面对军事法庭的羞辱
He committed suicide rather than face the disgrace of a court martial.

505
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:28,810
这些和你有什么关系
What's the connection?

506
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:36,150
他是我的父亲，我一直希望命运能让我们俩见面
He was my father. I'd hoped fate would bring us together one day.

507
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,240
好去为他报仇吗
To avenge him?

508
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,410
不是，好去感谢你给了他一个体面的结局
No, to thank you for giving him an honourable alternative.

509
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,750
进来
Come in.

510
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:52,250
卡马尔·汗要见你
Kamal Khan to see you.

511
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,130
邦德逃走了
Bond has escaped.

512
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,720
- 你真是大意 - 很抱歉
- How careless of you. - I apologise.

513
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,310
你来的正好，来见一下我的新客人吧
By the way, I'd like you to meet my new house guest.

514
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:10,100
你或许会说我是你们家的老朋友了
An old friend of the family, you might say.

515
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:11,350
真好
How lovely.

516
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:16,070
你求生的方式真是让人讨厌
You have a nasty habit of surviving.

517
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,690
你应该知道 这叫适者生存
You know what they say about the fittest.

518
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:25,450
八爪女，我很希望能有另一个机会去好好招待一下邦德先生
Octopussy, I'd enjoy another opportunity to take care of Mr Bond personally.

519
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:28,040
我会亲自招待好邦德先生的
I will take care of Mr Bond myself.

520
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,830
晚安
Good night.

521
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,540
好好放松一下吧
And enjoy yourselves.

522
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:38,760
邦德先生
Mr Bond.

523
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:50,060
我父亲后来成为了章鱼教的领袖
My father became a leading authority on octopi.

524
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:53,480
他深爱着它们，他把我昵称为八爪女
He loved them. His pet name for me was Octopussy.

525
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:02,610
邦德先生，走私不是英国情报部门的管辖范围
Mr Bond, smuggling is no concern of the secret service.

526
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,910
我也从未违反过英国法律
I've violated no British law.

527
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:09,950
你可以自由的离开这里，但我更希望你能在这里多留几天
You are free to leave, but I'd much prefer if you stayed as my guest for a few days.

528
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,330
我很荣幸
I'd like that.

529
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,920
格温多林，带邦德先生去他的房间
Gwendoline, show Mr Bond to his room.

530
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,510
晚安，邦德先生
Good night, Mr Bond.

531
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,760
明天早上见
Till the morning, then.

532
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,930
蜜琪
Midge.

533
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,850
好好招待邦德先生 但是要先把他房间周围的警卫加倍
Extend Mr Bond every courtesy, but double the guard on his quarters.

534
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,130
他说岛上的戒备非常森严
He says the island is heavily guarded.

535
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,220
我们不想成为那女人的敌人
We don't want to make enemies with the woman.

536
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:32,700
绝对不能伤到八爪女
The woman must not be harmed.

537
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:58,270
当我父亲的黄金花完之后，当初在香港替他卖掉黄金的人
When Father's gold ran out, the people in Hong Kong who'd disposed of it for him

538
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:01,520
给我提供了一个走私钻石的机会
offered me a commission to smuggle some diamonds.

539
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,940
我发现我对这种事很有天赋
I discovered I had a talent for it.

540
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:06,070
所以你就干上了这个
So you went into business for yourself?

541
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:10,370
是的，但是我需要一个组织，所以我重建了古老的章鱼教
Yes, but I needed an organisation, so I revived the old Octopus cult.

542
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,120
你是从哪里找来这么多的美女的？
Well, then. Where did you recruit all these lovelies?

543
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:19,290
在东南亚有很多这样的人
There are many of them all over Southeast Asia,

544
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:22,960
想找一个导师，寻求精神修炼，谁知道这是什么？
looking for a guru, spiritual discipline, who knows what.

545
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,370
我训练她们
I train them.

546
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:28,420
给了她们人生目标、姐妹情谊，还有富足的生活
Give them a purpose, a sisterhood and a way of life.

547
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:31,140
- 通过犯罪吗？ - 通过生意
- In crime? - In business.

548
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:35,220
我有很多产业，商场、酒店，还有巡回马戏团
I have diversified into shipping, hotels, carnivals and circuses.

549
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,770
- 他还在岛上吗？ - 你肯定是在开玩笑
- Is he still there? - You must be joking.

550
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,780
007在一座美女如云的岛上
007 on an island populated exclusively by women?

551
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:50,410
不到天亮是见不到他的
We won't see him till dawn.

552
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,240
- 我等到午夜再来换班 - 没问题
- I'll relieve you at midnight. - No problem.

553
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,310
我们要到别的地方去吗？
Are we going somewhere?

554
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:21,190
我明天早上要到欧洲去谈生意
I have to go to Europe tomorrow on a business trip.

555
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:25,860
真是可惜，我正想好好的享受一下生活呢
Oh, that's a pity. I was just beginning to enjoy myself.

556
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:29,690
我觉得你应该留下来，我只去一个星期
I think you should stay. I'll only be gone a week.

557
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:32,910
等我回来的之后，我们可以讨论一下未来
When I come back we'll discuss the future.

558
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:36,990
我不能保证你回来的时候我还会在这里
Well, I can't guarantee that I'll be here when you return.

559
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:40,540
詹姆斯，我们两个是同一类人
Oh, James. We're two of a kind.

560
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,500
以你的聪明才智，如果愿意冒险绝对会发大财
There are vast rewards for a man of your talents willing to take risks.

561
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:51,090
- 我不会干这个 - 你可真有原则
- I'm not for hire. - A man of principle.

562
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,090
有人想出钱买你的命
With a price on his head.

563
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,720
你当然是为了你的女王和国家做事
Naturally, you would do it for Queen and country.

564
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,310
我没有国家，也没有人想要我的命
I have no country, I have no price on my head.

565
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:05,150
我这样的人不需要向你这样一个收钱的杀手道歉
I don't have to apologise to you, a paid assassin, for what I am.

566
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:24,170
不要
No.

567
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,540
你说的没错
You're right.

568
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:28,420
我们是同一类人
We are two of a kind.

569
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,850
詹姆斯
James.

570
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,550
Q？
Q?

571
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,020
出什么事了？
Is something wrong?

572
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,900
没什么
Not really.

573
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,200
只是有一种感觉
Just a feeling.

574
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:02,320
那为什么不回到床上去呢？
Why don't you come back to bed?

575
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,760
快走开
Move!

576
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,490
詹姆斯
James.

577
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,460
小心
Watch it!

578
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:06,350
快走
Come on.

579
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,200
小心
Careful.

580
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:37,750
把枪给我
Give me the gun!

581
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:45,650
维贾伊怎么了？
What happened to Vijay?

582
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,740
我发现他的时候他还活着
He was alive when I found him.

583
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:56,160
- 他说什么了吗？ - 只说是卡马尔·汗的人
- Did he say anything? - Only say was "It was Kamal's men."

584
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,130
不会再发生这种事了
No more problems.

585
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,550
- 通知M到柏林和我见面 - 为什么
- You better signal M to meet me in Berlin. - Why?

586
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,850
我要去调查一下马克思市的巡回马戏团
Well, I have to go to a circus in Karl-Marx-Stadt.

587
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:27,030
已经证实了，009被杀的时候八爪女的马戏团也在东柏林
We verified the Octopussy Circus was in East Berlin when we lost 009.

588
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:30,870
在马克思市的东部
Karl-Marx-Stadt is further east.

589
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:36,200
奥尔洛夫将军为什么要参与珠宝走私呢？
Why would General Orlov participate in a jewellery caper?

590
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:40,540
珠宝走私，长官，请允许我做个不恰当的比喻
Well, the jewellery, sir, I think is, if you'll forgive the analogy,

591
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,130
只是章鱼触手的一小部分
only the tip of the tentacle.

592
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:46,510
这是你的新身份
Here's the ID you'll need.

593
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:50,760
查尔斯·莫顿，是来自利兹的制造商代表
Charles Moreton, manufacturer's representative from Leeds

594
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,760
到东柏林来参观家具工厂
visiting furniture factories in East Germany.

595
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,930
- 卡尔会带你进去 - 没问题
- Karl will take you in. - No problem.

596
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,400
记住，007，你只能靠自己
Remember, 007, you're on your own.

597
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,240
长官，谢谢你的关心
Thank you, sir. That's a great comfort.

598
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:23,220
（你们正在离开美国控制区）

599
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:51,210
米施卡
Mischka.

600
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:14,310
我想你应该认识伯尔奇同志，他是埃米塔什博物馆的馆长
Of course you know Comrade Borchoi, the curator of the Hermitage.

601
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,610
他刚刚从列宁格勒赶来
He just arrived from Leningrad.

602
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:20,320
罗曼诺夫之星
The Romanov Star.

603
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,250
罗曼诺夫之星
The Romanov Star.

604
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:11,790
他们给火车换轨的时候你留在这里看着珠宝
Stay here with the jewellery while they switch the car to the main track.

605
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:14,210
你也留下
You stay, also.

606
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,500
10万吨TNT当量
100 kiloton yield.

607
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:40,590
它的威力和影响范围与美国的中型核弹完全相同
The effects are indistinguishable from the American medium-yield bomb.

608
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,540
这是引爆器，现在听好
The detonator, now listen carefully.

609
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:48,600
预设四个小时之后引爆
It is pre-set for a four-hour delay.

610
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,560
在这里设置引爆时间
Set time for the explosion here.

611
01:28:55,200 --> 01:29:02,820
激活需要把它插入弹体 顺时针旋转90度
To activate, insert and twist the lever a quarter-turn clockwise.

612
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,700
爆炸的时候至少要离开20英里
Be at least 20 miles away when it goes off.

613
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,970
这些珠宝能让我们在苏黎世赚三亿美金
The jewellery should net us 300 million in Zurich.

614
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:15,470
现在我们先得穿过边界
We still have to cross the border.

615
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,060
我得走了
I must go.

616
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,570
再见了，小姐
Au revoir, dear lady.

617
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:27,940
祝你好运
Good luck.

618
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,050
把那筒子拿过来
Bring the canister.

619
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:25,810
放到车里
Put it in the car.

620
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:35,150
别管它了，我们走
Leave that. Let's go.

621
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:39,280
再待一会儿，坐到箱子上，双手放到膝盖上，快点
Let's stay. Sit on that box. Hands on your knees. Come on, move.

622
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:42,040
为什么火车上会有炸弹？
Why is that bomb on the train?

623
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,500
- 你是什么人？ - 英国特工
- Who are you? - British secret service.

624
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:55,510
你现在更应该关心的是怎么活着离开这里
You should be more concerned about getting out of here alive.

625
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,640
我现在更关心的是在美国的空军基地里即将爆炸的核弹
I am more concerned about an atomic bomb exploding on a US Air Force base.

626
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:05,060
你不会想挑起核战争的，如果美国报复怎么办？
You can't be inviting a nuclear war. What happens when the US retaliates?

627
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:07,230
向谁报复
Against whom?

628
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:11,400
天呐，当然了
My God. Of course.

629
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:16,530
我们的早期预警系统会排除这是俄国或者其他国家
Our early-warning system will rule out the bomb having come from Russia

630
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:18,660
发起的攻击
or anywhere else.

631
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:23,740
所有的人都会把这当成是美国核弹的意外爆炸
Everyone will assume incorrectly that it was a US bomb triggered accidentally.

632
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:28,290
这将会是最合理的解释
That would be the most plausible explanation.

633
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:31,380
欧洲就会实行单方面的核裁军
Europe will insist on disarmament,

634
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:34,880
边境的防御能力就会大幅下降，你的军队可以轻松突破
leaving every border undefended for you to walk across at will.

635
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,340
至于这场爆炸会让
It doesn't matter a damn to you

636
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,050
成千上万无辜的人死于非命，这不是你所关心的事
that thousands of innocent people will die in your accident.

637
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:44,390
这样总比让莫斯科的那群老政客
Better than letting a handful of old men in Moscow

638
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:48,730
在核裁军谈判中逐步丧失优势要好得多
bargain away our advantage in disarmament talks.

639
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:51,770
将军，站起来，你要去阻止火车
On your feet, General. You're going to stop that train.

640
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:58,740
- 太晚了 - 你可以在边界上拦下火车
- It's too late. - You can stop it at the border.

641
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,290
杀了他
Kill him!

642
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:08,410
杀了他
Kill him!

643
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:46,370
到车站去
Get to the station!

644
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,380
拦住那辆车
Stop that car!

645
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,200
停车
Stop.

646
01:35:33,210 --> 01:35:35,210
跟着那辆车
Follow that car.

647
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:23,940
卡马尔·汗让我们在穿越边界之前一直留在这里
Kamal Khan says we are to stay here until we cross the border.

648
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:36,080
这是奥尔洛夫将军的车
The licence plate is General Orlov's.

649
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:39,170
我们发现了这个
We have discovered this.

650
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,210
- 奥尔洛夫将军现在在哪？ - 有报告说他正在前往边界
- Where is General Orlov now? - Last reported heading for the border.

651
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,720
我得到那辆火车上去
I must get to that train.

652
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,480
停火
Stop!

653
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,120
卑劣的小偷
A common thief.

654
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:44,290
你是整个军队的耻辱
The disgrace to the uniform.

655
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:47,290
没错，但是明天
Yes. But tomorrow,

656
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:50,800
我将会成为
I shall be a hero

657
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,090
苏联的英雄
of the Soviet Union.

658
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,750
现在是11点45分
It is now 11.45.

659
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:28,920
表演会在3点开始
The performance begins at 3.

660
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,720
留出表演延迟的时间，设置到3点45分引爆
Allowing for delays, set the bomb to detonate at 3.45.

661
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:53,990

662
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,110
我想你们都不会迟到的

663
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:14,630
去看好珠宝
The jewellery.

664
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:17,250
- 你认出那是谁了吗？ - 没有

665

在这陪着她

666
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,720
车顶上有人
On the roof. Trouble.

01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:35,750
米施卡
Mischka.

668
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,120
这一刀
And this,

669
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:16,250
是为我哥哥报仇
for my brother.

670
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:24,630
这是为009报仇
And that's for 009.

671
01:47:05,190 --> 01:47:07,780
戈宾达会好好看着珠宝的

672
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:57,590
将军，我得失陪一下，我要去安排一下行程，好好欣赏表演吧
General, excuse me. I have some travel arrangements to make. Enjoy the show.

673
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:00,760
- 谢谢你 - 我想将军一定会非常喜欢的
- Thank you. - I'm sure he'll get a big blast out of this.

674
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:03,270
我相信他是不会失望的
I know he won't be disappointed.

675
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:31,230
- 那是邦德 - 很好，让他去吧
- That was Bond. - Good. Let him keep going.

676
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:33,520
已经来不及了，正好把他也除掉
He'll be late and we'll be rid of him too.

677
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:39,740
棒极了，对吗？
Great, isn't it?

678
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:49,120
太棒了
Fantastic.

679
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:56,380
- 真精彩 - 将军
- Marvellous. - General,

680
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:59,380
如果我偷了你的钱包，会被关多久的禁闭呢？
How long would I get in the brig if I stole your wallet?

681
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:01,720
- 大约两年 - 这么久啊
- About two years. - That long?

682
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:04,890
既然是这样，那我还是还给你吧
Well, in that case, I'd better return it.

683
01:51:04,970 --> 01:51:06,470
你这个小坏蛋
Son of a gun.

684
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:11,150
（美军费尔德空军基地）

685
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,350
基地指挥官在哪里？
Where's the Base Commander?

686
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:19,820
出示你的马戏团通行证
Let's see your circus pass.

687
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:21,570
可恶，这是紧急事件
Damn it, man, it's urgent.

688
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:24,490
下车，把手举起来
Get out. Hands up!

689
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:36,250
上尉，有个疯子开着一辆赃车闯了进去
Captain, a nut went through in a stolen car.

690
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:39,210
点名要找指挥官，他穿着一件个红色的衬衫
Wants the Base Commander, and he's wearing a red shirt.

691
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:43,220
他在那
There he is.

692
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:49,350
就是那个穿红色衬衫的家伙
Go after that guy in the red shirt.

693
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:53,020
在拖车后面
Behind the trailers.

694
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:15,710
所有人继续搜查，他一定就在这附近
Keep searching, you guys. He's gotta be around here somewhere.

695
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:21,130
你的人去搜查一下拖车底下
Look under the trailer, you guys.

696
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:55,870
- 女士们、先生们 - 嘿，有别人在里面吗？
- Ladies and gentlemen... - Hey. Is anyone else in there?

697
01:52:55,960 --> 01:53:02,920
这是第一次在这里表演的节目，挑战死亡极限的人肉炸弹
For the first time in this country, the death-defying human cannonball.

698
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:08,680
我很荣幸的为大家介绍，这是勇敢无畏的弗朗西斯科
I have the pleasure in presenting to you Francisco the Fearless.

699
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,440
疑犯穿着小丑的服装
The suspect's wearing a clown suit. Over.

700
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,320
就是他
That's him.

701
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:34,910
等一下，老兄，跟我们走
Hold it, buddy. You're coming with us.

702
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,470
将军，大炮里有一枚炸弹
General, there's a bomb in that cannon.

703
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:55,270
当然了，不然炸弹还能放到哪？
Sure. Where else would a bomb be?

704
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:56,930
这小丑真不错
Great clown.

705
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:59,770
我是认真的，我是英国特工
I'm deadly serious. I'm a British agent.

706
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:00,850
什么？
What?

707
01:54:00,930 --> 01:54:02,610
看在上帝的份上，快告诉他我是谁
For God's sake, tell him who I am.

708
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:06,280
卡马尔和奥尔洛夫骗了你，他们把珠宝从火车上拿走了
Kamal and Orlov double-crossed you. I saw them take the jewellery off the train.

709
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:09,820
这样你应该相信了吧
Does that convince you?

710
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:15,580
长官，核弹设定在3点45分引爆，现在只剩90秒了
Sir, that bomb is set to explode at 3.45. That's 90 seconds from now.

711
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:18,120
将军，他不是喝醉了就是个疯子
General, this man's either drunk or crazy.

712
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:28,050
他会毁了整个行动的
He'll destroy the entire operation.

713
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:49,360
你们俩，抓住他，快抓住他
You two, grab that man. Hold him.

714
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:51,950
该死，快放开我
Damn it. Let go.

715
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:55,080
快放开我，那里面有炸弹
Let me go, there's a bomb in there.

716
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:08,960
放开他
Let him go.

717
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:12,840
所有人，安静
Quiet, everyone.

718
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:30,030
是现在吗？
Now?

719
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:33,910
谢谢你，干得好
Thank you. Great job, sir.

720
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,740
卡马尔去哪了？
Where was Kamal going?

721
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:38,330
回印度了
Back to India.

722
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:48,340
各位观众，刚才出了点紧急状况，不过现在已经没事了
Folks, we've had an emergency, but everything is all right now.

723
01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:51,550
你和你们的家人都是安全的
You and your families are safe.

724
01:55:51,630 --> 01:55:56,600
现在请各位有序的离开这里，谢谢大家
Now, please leave the tent in an orderly manner. Thank you.

725
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:03,640

We'll take these also. Dollars, pounds, francs, marks.

728
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:14,320
我可以自己印钞票
I can always print my own.

729
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:22,000
- 怎么了？ - 是女孩们在勾引男人
- What is that? - Girls selling themselves.

730
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:25,420
很好，这可以让他们忙上一阵子了
Good. It will keep the men occupied.

731
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,540
我不想让他们看到我离开
I don't want them to see me leave.

732
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:37,510
跳
Now.

733
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:49,820
帮我一下
Give us a hand.

734
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:29,230
快点
Come on.

735
01:57:53,130 --> 01:57:54,800
我们走，都解决了吗？
Let's go. All set?

736
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:06,980
举起来
Lift.

737
01:58:13,190 --> 01:58:14,860
就这样，稳住
That's it. Steady.

01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:28,660
- 你去让他们给马都装上马鞍 - 是，先生
- Make sure the horses are saddled. - Yes, Excellence.

739
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:31,210
我等会去和你会和
I'll join you in a few minutes.

740
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:49,600
- 你以为你真能逃得掉吗？ - 奥尔洛夫背叛了我们
- Do you really think you can escape me? - Orlov betrayed us.

741
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:52,650
我发誓我根本不知道核弹的事
I swear I knew nothing about the bomb.

742
01:58:52,730 --> 01:58:55,230
八爪女，我们是合作伙伴，也是朋友
We're partners, we're friends. Octopussy.

743
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:59,110
我是不会做任何伤害你的事的
I would never do anything to hurt you.

744
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:16,000
你想让我和成千上万无辜的人一起被炸死
You left me to be killed along with thousands of innocent people.

745
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:17,880
八爪女

746
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:19,460
八爪女
Octopussy.

747
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:23,840
你看，我把这个给你带回来了
Look. I was bringing you this.

748
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:25,970
我们会发大财的
We can make millions.

749
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:33,270
抓住她，她能让我们安全的离开这里的
Take her. She's our ticket out of here.

750
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:00,090
- Q，我相信你能操纵这东西 - 这是依靠热空气的
- I trust you can handle this contraption, Q. - It goes by hot air.

751
02:00:00,170 --> 02:00:01,840
你肯定能行
Oh, then you can.

752
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:14,980
- 她们已经控制住局势了 - 但是我没看到八爪女
- They're doing fine. - But I don't see Octopussy.

753
02:00:31,910 --> 02:00:35,040
- 在那里，她有麻烦了 - 把你的脏手拿开
- There she is. She's in trouble. - Get your hands off me.

754
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:37,000
- 我会降下去 - 不，上升
- I'll take her down. - No. Up!

755
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:42,840
你到底想要去哪？007，别犯傻了，快点回来
Where are you going? Look, don't be an idiot, 007. Come back.

756
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:53,350
杀了他
Kill him.

757
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:21,560
快点
Come on.

758
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,780
你们要干什么？别闹了
What are you doing? Cut it out.

759
02:02:25,780 --> 02:02:28,780
我们没有时间了... 等一会也行
We haven't time for that. Later perhaps.

760
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:55,760
快，快点
Come on. Giddap.

761
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:12,530
快点
Come on.

762
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:43,660
他会害死我们的，出去杀了他

763
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:46,370
- 出去 - 快点

764
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:47,830
是，先生
Yes, Excellence.

02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:09,710
跳
Jump!

766
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:40,030
我国政府坚决否认发生过这件事情
My government categorically denies the incident ever occurred.

767
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:46,200
但是我们还是想请邦德先生归还我们的国宝
However, we request Bond to return one of our most historic treasures,

768
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:47,830
罗曼诺夫之星
the Romanov Star.

769
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:52,920
考虑到英国和苏联的双边关系，我们会归还给你们的
In the interests of our Anglo-Soviet relationships, that can be arranged.

770
02:06:53,590 --> 02:06:55,340
邦德中校现在在哪
Where is Commander Bond?

771
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:59,080
很不幸，邦德在行动中受了非常严重的伤
Well, unfortunately owing to the serious nature of his injuries

772
02:06:59,390 --> 02:07:01,260
他现在不适合进行长途旅行
he's still not fit enough to travel.

773
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:05,430
一 二 一 二
In. Out. In. Out.

774
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:22,030
- 我希望... - 什么？
- I wish... - What?

775
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:27,330
我真希望你的身体现在不是这么虚弱
I wish you weren't in such a weakened condition.

776
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:38,300
詹姆斯
