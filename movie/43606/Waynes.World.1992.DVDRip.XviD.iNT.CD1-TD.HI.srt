Does anyone else
smell bacon?

Yeah, I
definitely smell

Hey, what
are you up to?

221
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,633
I just pulled over
a tour bus

222
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,532
on its way to Chicago.

223
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,039
We had a tip there was
some drug smuggling going down.

224
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:02,539
We searched
the entire vehicle.

225
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,873
It was clean, so we proceeded
with body cavity searches.

226
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,002
No way.

227
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,479
Way! I inspected
12 individuals myself...

228

to Rampart.

Why is it if a man kills
another man in battle

244
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,049
it's called heroic?

245
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,519
Yet if he kills a man
in the heat of passion

246
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,021
it's called murder?

Mr. Vanderhoff,
this is your audience.

00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:20,290

with <i>Love Boat.</i>

422
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,159
If I may,

423
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,259
speaking from
a producer/director standpoint,

424
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:28,237
kids can relate
to this show.

425
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:29,739
These guys
aren't phonies.

426
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:33,334
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

427
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,844
Kids know dick.

428
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,846
I watch them
in my arcades.

429
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,848
They stand like
laboratory rats

430
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,850
hitting the feeder bar
to get food pellets.

431
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:44,149
As long as they pump in quarters,
who gives a shit?

432
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:46,889
Let me ask you something.

433
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:50,085
What's your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

434
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:53,597
Well, uh, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

435
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:56,599
Like, we have a new game
called Zantar.

436
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,601
Zantar is a gelatinous cube

437
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:01,103
that eats warriors
in a medieval village.

438
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,605
Every time
it eats a chieftain

439
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,971
you ascend
to a higher level.

440
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,977
Beauty part is you can't
get to the next level.

441
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:09,876
The kids keep
coughing up quarters.

442
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:11,574
Gelatinous cube
eats village...

443
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,082
I think it's terrific.

444
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,084
You know, I know nothing
about video games.

445
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:16,881
I found what you
just said riveting.

446
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:18,717
Well, I do
my own commercials.

447
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:19,915
I did not know that.

448
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,015
I don't mention the games
in the commercials

449
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:25,426
because the technology moves
much faster than the advertising.

450
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:26,485
I did not realize that.

451
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,225
Russell, did you
realize that?

452
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,823
No, I did not
realize that.

453
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,663
So, Mr. Vanderhoff,

454
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:34,000
let me see if I'm
hearing you correctly.

455
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:36,505
Are you saying
that if you had a spot,

456
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:38,007
say on a weekly show,

457
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,009
that you could
come on the show

458
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:41,476
and update the kids

459
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:43,775
on exactly what was new
in your arcade?

460
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:46,646
Yeah, that's it.

461
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:47,649
I'm impressed.

462
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:49,049

491
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:56,517
That's not enough.

492
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:57,519
What?

493
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:58,520
We got... that.

494
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:01,023
That's good,
but I need more.

495
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:03,389
Oh, man!
Why don't you use a gun?

496
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,224
It's not my fault.
Come on.

497
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,093
I suppose it's
society's fault?

498
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:08,096
More.

499
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:09,826
[RRRrrrr]

500
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,832
Cool.

501
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:12,095
All right.

502
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,602
[RRRrrrr RRRrrrr]

503
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,070
Here's an extra dollar.

504
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:19,541
You guys should have been
at Gasworks on Friday.

505
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,043
Yeah, we were there.

506
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,306
There was this band...
Crucial Taunt...

507
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,178
They had this megababe
for a lead singer. Unreal!

508
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,683
Phil, we were there.

509
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:30,219
Have you gone mental?
Hello?

510
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:32,551
I think we should go now.

511
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,555
Here you go.

512
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:34,792
Cool!

513
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:53,642
You think it's wise
to sell a show we don't own?

514
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,644
By tonight, we will.

515
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:58,078
Ah!

516
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:04,620
Excuse me.

517
00:22:04,688 --> 00:22:07,623
Do you know where
we could find Wayne Campbell?

518
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,124
That'd be privileged
information.

519
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:11,593
We just want to know
where they broadcast from.

520
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,596
Are you a friend
or a relative?

521
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:15,723
We're neither.

522
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,231
Russell, I may not have
grown up around here,

523
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,238
but I understand these people.

524
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,641
This must be the place.

525
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:32,546
OK, we're just about
out of time, right?

526
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,176
But first let's give
a <i>Wayne's World</i> salute

527
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,686
to the Guess jeans girl
Claudia Schiffer.

528
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:38,686
Schwing!

529
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:39,949
Schwing!

530
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:41,991
Tent pole!
She's a babe.

531
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,050
She's magically
babe-licious.

532
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:47,062
She tested very high
on the strokability scale.

533
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,290
Mmrreowww!

534
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,026
Ssss.

535
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,431
Are you through yet?

536
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:53,435
I'm getting tired
of holding this.

537
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,437
Yeah, that's
what she said.

538
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,610
OK, so, Claudia Schiffer,
we salute you.

539
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:03,509
- Scha-wing!
- Scha-wing!

540
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,912
That's all the time
we have this week.

541
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:07,245
Until then, good night.

542
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:08,614
Party on, Wayne.

And... we're clear.

548
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:21,094
O.K. Excellent show,
everyone.

549

Excellent.

550
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,667
Great show.

Regional program director
for Oliver Communications.

553
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:30,198
Oh, hello.

554
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,674
I'm Russell Finley.
We spoke earlier today. Hi.

555
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,177
Maybe we can go somewhere
and get acquainted.

556
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,304
Russell,
get to know the crew.

557
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:38,814
You know anywhere nice?

558
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:40,474
Hi.

559
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,847
Hi.

560
00:23:45,222 --> 00:23:47,656
Let me get this
out of the way...

561
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:48,952
I'm a big fan.

562
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:50,220
You are?

563
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:54,287
As I see it, your show's
capable of so much more.

564
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:55,797
We'll try harder, OK?

565
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:57,800
Give us a second chance.

566
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:00,302
Don't cancel us
without a second chance.

567
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,736
Garth, relax, all right?
Your pills?

568
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:04,239
He can't cancel us.

569
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:06,401
We're on public access.

570
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:07,909
Can I be honest?

571
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:10,446
My job, it's usually
such a bore,

572
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:13,074
but the other day something
incredible happened.

573
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,014
What happened?

574
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:15,346
Noah Vanderhoff,

575
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,354
owner of the largest
video arcade chain in Chicago,

576
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:19,821
is in my office

577
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,256
asking me what's with
this show <i>Wayne's World</i>

578
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,759
I hear so much about?

579
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:25,886
I have your shows on tape.

580
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:27,430
I said I'm a fan.

581
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,431
I put a show in.

582
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:31,558
He literally jumped
out of his seat.

583
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:32,693
- Cool.
- Cool.

584
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:34,703
He wants to sponsor
the show,

585
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:36,705
put you on our station,

586
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,673
and pay you
a huge salary.

587
00:24:38,742 --> 00:24:41,040
He doesn't realize
you're both artists.

588
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:42,544
You're not interested
in money.

589
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:44,409
No, we're not
interested in money.

590
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,415
That's what I told him.

591
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:49,418
But he said take them
two cashier's checks anyway

592
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:51,181
so they know I'm serious.

593
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:53,415
I may be wasting my time,

594
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,890
but here I am
with the contract

595
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,586
and two cashier's checks

596
00:24:57,661 --> 00:25:00,755
for $5,000 each.

597
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,492
Exsqueeze me?

598
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:04,056
Baking powder?

599
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:07,069
You're going to pay us
for doing <i>Wayne's World?</i>

600
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:08,399
Give me the word.

601
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:09,939
I'll tear up
these checks.

602
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,099
[Chokes]

603
00:25:11,174 --> 00:25:12,198

He shoots,
he scores!

605
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:18,380
Want to look
at the contracts?

606
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:19,380
Yes.

607
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:20,882
Do you have a lawyer?

608
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:22,384
Yes. Uh... no.

609
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:24,386
We're between
lawyers right now.

610
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:27,423
Our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly.

611
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:30,392
That's right. I walked
right into that office,

612
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,122
I grabbed him
by his big fat head,

613
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:37,633
and I said I'm not going to jail
for you or anybody.

614
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,828
Exactly.

615
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:45,133
Can I have an opportunity
to peruse that contract

616
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,835
before we sign it?

617
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:49,372
Hmm.

618
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,640
Yes.

619
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:53,114
Yes.

620
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,481
I like what
you've done here.

621
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:57,179
Ah. Hmm.

622
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:58,551
Yes.

623
00:25:58,622 --> 00:25:59,816
Yes.

624
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,824
Um, I dropped my pen.

625
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,826
I'm not so sure about...

626
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,794
Oh, I see. I see.

627
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:08,296
Hi. Um, does this seem weird?

628
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:10,299
Why does this guy
have contracts?

629
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,800
Ever see
<i>The Twilight Zone</i>

630
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:13,802
where the guy
signed a contract,

631
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,306
they cut out his tongue,
put it in a jar,

632
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:18,807
and it wouldn't die?

633
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:22,333
It grew and pulsated
and gave birth to baby tongues.

634
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,676
Pretty cool, huh?
I got to go.

635
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:25,840
I like this part.

636
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:29,682
I feel we can work with you
on this project.

get the CD player?

out of the low "E."

Where's the clerk?

Not today, my good man.

Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

Yes. Briefly.
He was not very receptive.

Oh, really? Well, I'll explain
to him that it's not a choice,

that it's in his contract.

No. You don't understand.
They laid me off.

The fact is,
he's the sponsor

doesn't include selling out.
