1
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,260
Spend all day with us.

2
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,262
There are two...
pardon me...

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,266
two of everything in
every Noah's arcade.

4
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,187
That means
two of Zantar,

5
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:36,710
That means
two of Zantar,

6
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:40,280
Bay Wolf, Ninja Commando,
Snake-azon,

7
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:41,290
Psycho Chopper...

8
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,293
It's really good
seeing you, Benjamin.

9
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,295
You haven't been into
Shakey's for so long.

10
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:47,729
Well, I've
been real busy.

11
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,166
It's two for you
'cause one won't do.

12
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,295
All this week,
kids under 6

13
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,303
get every fifth...

14
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:55,304
There's a new pet.

15
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:56,567
Ch-Ch-Chia

16
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,007
Chia Pet...
the pottery that grows.

17
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:01,875
They are very fast.

18
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:03,380
Simple. Plug it in,

19
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,383
and insert the plug
from just about anything.

20
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,078
Simple.

21
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,587
Even for our customers
in Waukegan, Elgin, and Aurora...

22
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,623
We'll be there
right on time.

23
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,022
So call!

24
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:15,889
Clap on, clap off

25
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,326
The Clapper

26
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:19,989
Wayne's World,
Wayne's World

27
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:20,997
Party time

28
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,294
Excellent

29
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:26,168
O.K.

30
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:27,169
All right,
excellent.

31
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:28,170
Excellent.

32
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,171
Whoo!

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,038
O.K., extreme close-up!

34
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,704
Waa!

35
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:37,213
Waa!

36
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:40,649
Waa!

37
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,651
Excellent.

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,153
Excellent
extreme close-up.

39
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,155
Now it's time for
Wayne's World's totally amazing

40
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:46,884
excellent discoveries.

41
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,721
Our guest
is Ron Paxton.

42
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:50,556
Welcome to
Wayne's World, Ron.

43
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:51,721
Thanks, Wayne.

44
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:54,731
Now, you're the inventor
of the Suck Kut, right?

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,767
What exactly
is a Suck Kut?

46
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:59,269
The Suck Kut is a revolution
in home hair cutting.

47
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:03,433
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery.

48
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:04,702
Well, yes.

49
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:09,742
Fireworks!

50
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:12,749
Now, Ron, the question that's
on everybody's mind is,

51
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:14,284
how does it work?

52
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:16,786
I'm fully prepared to give
a complete demonstration.

53
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:18,789
O.K. O.K., Garth,
just sit there.

54
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:21,189
He's going to put that
thing on your melon, O.K.?

55
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,420
Just a trim.
Don't buzz me, all right?

56
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:25,019
Uhh! Uhh!

57
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:27,030
Ohh! Ohh!

58
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:29,032
Ohh! Ohh!

59
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,294
Tell me, Ron.

60
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:32,700
Exactly how does
the Suck Kut work?

61
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:37,003
Well, as you can see,
it sucks as it cuts.

62
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:39,475
It certainly
does suck.

63
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:42,513
Ohh! Ohh!

64
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,172
What are we looking at?

65
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,717
Wayne's World. These guys do
their show out of their basement.

66
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,719
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

67
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,220
Ohh!

68
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:51,380
Ohh!

69
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:52,787
People watch this?

70
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:53,789
Yeah, lots.

71
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,849
Turn it off, man!
Turn it off!

72
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:57,690
It's sucking
my will to live!

73
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,627
Oh, the humanity!

74
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,962
You want to hand me
the telephone?

75
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:04,967
Sure.

76
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:05,968
Uhh!

77
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:06,969
Uhh!

78
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,471
Russell, this
is Benjamin.

79
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,132
Are you
watching TV?

80
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,768
Listen, could you
turn it to channel 10?

81
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,779
I want you to find out
who these guys are

82
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,781
and where they
do their show.

83
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,942
I think we can
sell it to Vanderhoff.

84
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:21,576
Take your Ritalin, O.K.?

85
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:23,587
O.K., you're
in a forest.

86
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:24,644
Forest?

87
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,588
You're in a forest
with Heather Locklear.

88
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:27,590
With Heather?

89
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,593
And you're very warm.
Very...

90
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:30,628
- Warm?
- warm.

91
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,754
These guys
are so funny.

92
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:34,594
Oh, they're
obviously brilliant.

93
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,767
Hmm.

94
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:45,233
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery... not!

95
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,470
Thanks, Ron.

96
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,914
O.K., that's all the time
we have for this week.

97
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:51,914
Until then, good night!

98
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:52,915
Party on, Wayne.

99
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,110
Party on, Garth.

100
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,413
It's Wayne's World,
Wayne's World

101
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:56,419
Party time

102
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:57,512
Excellent

103
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,060
And...

104
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:04,152
we're clear!

105
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:05,355
All right!

106
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,362
Excellent!

107
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:07,523
Whoo! Whoo!

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,725
All right!

109
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,732
Excellent!

110
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:10,825
Excellent!

111
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,029
Let me bring you
up to speed.

112
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,038
My name is
Wayne Campbell.

113
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:17,040
I live in
Aurora, Illinois,

114
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,372
which is
a suburb of Chicago.

115
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:20,376
Excellent!

116
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:23,380
I've had plenty
of Joe jobs.

117
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,382
Nothing I'd call
a career.

118
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,384
Let me put it
this way.

119
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:31,218
I have an extensive collection
of name tags and hair nets.

120
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,227
O.K., I still
live with my parents,

121
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,889
which I admit
is both bogus and sad.

122
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:42,899
But at least I've got
an amazing cable access show,

123
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,901
and I still
know how to party.

124
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,903
But what
I'd really love

125
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:48,905
is to do Wayne's World
for a living.

126
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:50,406
It might happen.

127
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:52,909
Yeah, and monkeys might
fly out of my butt.

128
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,673
Ahh, the Mirthmobile.

129
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,749
This is my best friend
Garth Algar.

130
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:05,949
Hi.

131
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,925
I think we'll go with a little
Bohemian Rhapsody, gentlemen.

132
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,426
Good call.

133
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:20,168
I see a little
silhouette of a man

134
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:21,894
Scaramouche,
Scaramouche

135
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,699
Will you do
the fandango?

136
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,364
Thunderbolts
and lightning

137
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,340
Very, very
frightening

138
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:28,341
Galileo

139
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,377
Galileo

140
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:30,536
- Galileo
- Galileo

141
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:31,806
Galileo, Figaro

142
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,814
Let me go-o-o-o

143
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:35,474
I'm just a poor boy

144
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,178
Nobody loves me

145
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,742
He's just
a poor boy

146
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,048
From a poor family

147
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,216
Spare him his life
from this monstrosity

148
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:46,227
Whoa!
It's Phil.

149
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:52,165
Phil, what are you
doing here?

150
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,862
You're partied out,
man... again.

151
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,462
What if he honks
in the car?

152
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,234
I'm giving you
a no-honk guarantee.

153
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:03,108
Phil! Um...

154
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:05,646
if you're
going to spew,

155
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:07,409
spew into this.

156
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:12,811
Easy come, easy go

157
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,253
Will you let me go?

158
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:16,018
Bismillah

159
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,149
No! We will not
let you go

160
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,157
Let him go

161
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:19,284
Bismillah

162
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:20,487
We will not
let you go

163
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:21,494
Let him go

164
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:22,655
Bismillah

165
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:23,663
We will not
let you go

166
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:24,664
Let me go

167
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:25,665
We will not
let you go

168
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:26,792
Let me go

169
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,995
Let me go-o-o-o

170
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,335
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no

171
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,135
Oh, mama mia,
mama mia

172
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,675
Mama mia,
let me go

173
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,210
Beelzebub

174
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:39,008
Has a devil
put aside for me

175
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,140
For me

176
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:45,016
For me

177
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,159
So you think
you can stone me

178
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,424
And spit in my eye

179
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,331
So you think you
can love me and leave me

180
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:03,030
To die

181
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,538
Oh, baby

182
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:06,039
Garth, pull over.

183
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:08,042
Oh! Oh, man!
Come on!

184
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,702
Not again.

185
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,750
He does this
every Friday.

186
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:18,877
Stop torturing
yourself, man!

187
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:20,387
You'll never
afford it!

188
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:23,151
Live in
the now!

189
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:26,160
It will be mine.

190
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:30,324
Oh, yes.
It will be mine.

191
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:37,163
Ooh

192
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,672
Oh, yeah

193
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,332
Oh, yeah

194
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:52,114
Nothing really matters

195
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:55,679
Anyone can see

196
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:59,249
Nothing really matters

197
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:02,990
Nothing
really matters

198
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:07,729
To me

199
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:12,172
Hey, Wayne's world!
Wayne's world! Party!

200
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,174
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

201
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:16,176
Excellent!

202
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:18,678
Way to go!

203
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,681
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

204
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,273
Party on, Wayne!

205
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,012
Hey, Campbell.

206
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,648
Uno momento, fellas.

207
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,920
Officer Kuharski,
how's it going?

208
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:34,586
Fine.

209
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,096
Say, I smell bacon.

210
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:38,098
Does anyone else
smell bacon?

211
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,100
Yeah, I
definitely smell

212
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:42,102
a pork product
of some type.

213
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,434
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know
what you're doing, Campbell.

214
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:47,566
Bacon, pig, oink-oink,
police officer.

215
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:48,836
Ha ha ha.

216
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,174
I said that to cops
when I was your age.

217
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,771
Hey, what
are you up to?

218
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,783
I just pulled over
a tour bus

219
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,682
on its way to Chicago.

220
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:01,189
We had a tip there was
some drug smuggling going down.

221
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:02,689
We searched
the entire vehicle.

222
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:06,023
It was clean, so we proceeded
with body cavity searches.

223
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:07,152
No way.

224
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,629
Way! I inspected
12 individuals myself...

225
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:10,960
Inside and out.

226
00:09:11,032 --> 00:09:11,964
Eeew!

227
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:15,835
Uhh!

228
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:17,166
Ugh!

229
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,673
O.K., this guy needs coffee
and crullers stat!

230
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,675
We got to get him
to Rampart.

231
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:23,404
Let's go!

232
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:25,673
This is
Stan Mikita's Donuts.

233
00:09:25,747 --> 00:09:28,181
Excellent munchie post.

234
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,185
This is
the manager, Glen.

235
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:33,687
He's here
24 hours a day.

236
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:35,689
I recommend
the sugar pucks.

237
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:37,190
They're excellent.
Come on.

238
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:39,693
I'd never done
a crazy thing in my life

239
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,194
before that night.

240
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:44,699
Why is it if a man kills
another man in battle

241
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,199
it's called heroic?

242
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:49,669
Yet if he kills a man
in the heat of passion

243
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,171
it's called murder?

244
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,173
Hello! What do you
think you're doing?

245
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:56,176
Only me and Garth get
to talk to the camera.

246
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:57,677
Come on.

247
00:09:57,746 --> 00:10:00,840
I don't really have too much
to say right now.

248
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,213
What's that?

249
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:04,680
Ohh! Ohh!

250
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:06,687
Hi, Mr.Withers.
How's the amusement park going?

251
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:08,188
Just great, Wayne.

252
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,227
Four coffees and
a half a dozen crullers, please.

253
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:14,887
And one jelly donut.

254
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:20,428
Hey, there's your girlfriend,
Garth. Yeah.

255
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:38,511
Ow!

256
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:44,691
Excuse me.
I fell.

257
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,195
Don't you guys ever get tired
of ordering the same thing?

258
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:50,925
- No.
- No.

259
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,933
Uh-oh.
Don't look. Stacy.

260
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:53,933
Where?

261
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:58,195
Oh, God.
I made eye contact.

262
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,173
Psycho hose beast.

263
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,181
Happy anniversary, Wayne.

264
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,183
Stacy, we broke up
two months ago.

265
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,310
That doesn't mean
we can't still go out.

266
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:12,819
Well, it does, actually.

267
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:14,981
That's what
breaking up is.

268
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,149
You going to go
to the Gasworks tonight?

269
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:18,157
No!

270
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,318
- No!
- No!

271
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,919
Don't you want
to open your present?

272
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:24,488
If it's a severed head,
I'll be very upset.

273
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,158
Open it.

274
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,166
O.K.

275
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,293
O.K.

276
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:32,939
What is it?

277
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:35,101
It's a gun rack.

278
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,234
A gun rack?

279
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,142
A gun rack.

280
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:40,204
Yeah, great.

281
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,216
I don't
even own a gun,

282
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,717
let alone many guns

283
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,377
that would necessitate
an entire rack.

284
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,421
What am I going to do

285
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,081
with a gun rack?

286
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:51,990
You don't like it, fine.

287
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:55,192
Wayne, if you're not careful,

288
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,890
you're going
to lose me.

289
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,160
I lost you
two months ago.

290
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:01,668
Are you mental?
We broke up.

291
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:04,204
Get the net!

292
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:22,188
Wayne!

293
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:23,189
Hey!

294
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:24,691
How you doing?

295
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,691
Garth!

296
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,193
Tiny, who's
playing tonight?

297
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:30,026
Jolly Green Giants,
The Shitty Beatles.

298
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,532
The Shitty Beatles...
are they any good?

299
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,692
They suck.

300
00:12:33,768 --> 00:12:36,703
Then it's not just
a clever name?

301
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:38,204
Who else?

302
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:40,207
Crucial Taunt,
and they're just finishing the set.

303
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,708
I hear they can wail.

304
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,209
You're right.
Party on.

305
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:44,210
Party on.

306
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,371
Yo!

307
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,217
All right!

308
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:53,049
Now, dig this, baby!

309
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,055
You don't
care for me

310
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,988
I don't
care about that

311
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,491
This is the Gasworks,

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,187
an excellent
heavy metal bar.

313
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:01,694
Always a babe fest.

314
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:03,958
And they got
a pool table, too.

315
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:07,433
Let me stand
next to your fire

316
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:08,935
Party! Whoo!

317
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,437
Yeow! Party!

318
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:11,437
Excuse me.

319
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,125
Whoo!

320
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,783
Let me stand
next to your fire

321
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,192
Let me stand

322
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,196
Let me stand
next to your fire

323
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,198
Excuse me.

324
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,200
Um, excuse me.

325
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,200
What?

326
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,930
I'd like to get by now.

327
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:28,303
Get out of my face,
you little dweeb.

328
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,773
Ohh!

329
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,173
Ow!

330
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,372
I have only one
itchin' desire

331
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,745
Let me stand
next to your fire

332
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,805
Ohh

333
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,114
Let me stand
next to your fire

334
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,200
You don't
care for me

335
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,767
I don't care
about that

336
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,746
You got a new fool,
I like it like that

337
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,511
I have only
one burnin' desire

338
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,849
Let me stand
next to your fire

339
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,183
Excuse me.

340
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,189
Hey, let me stand
next to your fire

341
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,191
What do you want,
you little dweeb?

342
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,124
Oh, let me stand
next to your fire

343
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,163
Aah!

344
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,670
Thank you.

345
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,206
You say your mama
ain't home

346
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,707
It ain't my concern

347
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,506
Just don't play with me
and you won't get burned

348
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:43,879
Oh, dream weaver

349
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,781
I believe you can
get me through...

350
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,876
She's a babe!
Schwing!

351
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,685
Ohh

352
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,323
Yeah

353
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,366
Ohh

354
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,366
Ohh, ohh

355
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,927
Ohh

356
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:22,781
Hey

357
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,787
Ow, ow! Ha ha!

358
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,675
Hyah!

359
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,578
Yeah.

360
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,446
Ow! All right.

361
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,041
Ohh.

362
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,349
I love this woman.

363
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,656
Hey, Raymond, club soda
with a lime, please.

364
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,193
And would you
get me a towel?

365
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,694
Boy, you really wail.

366
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,196
Thanks.

367
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,199
Hey, you're that
party time guy on TV.

368
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,199
Wayne, right?

369
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,428
Yes, and you are?

370
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,435
Cassandra.

371
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,698
Cassandra.

372
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,707
Rough night, huh?
Everybody's kung fu fighting.

373
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,837
Yeah. Well,
nice meeting you.

374
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,177
Hey, hold on!
Can I call you sometime?

375
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,685
You got 5 bucks,
you can come to the rent party.

376
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,185
It's at my loft.

377
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,346
I'm there.

378
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,855
I got to go.

379
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,359
The club owner's trying to dick me
out of some money.

380
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,418
O.K. O.K.

381
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,258
See how many
people I...

382
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,457
That bass player's
a babe.

383
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,468
She makes me feel
kind of funny,

384
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,267
like when we used
to climb the rope in gym class.

385
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,933
You said I get
cash up front.

386
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,704
She will be mine.

387
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,372
Oh, yes.
She will be mine.

388
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,223
Pardon me.

389
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,489
Do you have
any Grey Poupon?

390
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,216
Garth,
just sit there.

391
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,277
He's going to put
that on your melon.

392
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,289
O.K., but
just a trim.

393
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,517
Don't buzz me,
all right?

394
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,423
Uhh!

395
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,756
Uhh!

396
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,760
Uhh!

397
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,797
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

398
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,492
Oh, no!

399
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,591
Russell, stop the tape.

400
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,102
So, what do you think?

401
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,834
I think it's two chimps on
a davenport in a basement.

402
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,773
I'm not sponsoring this.

403
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,334
I got spots on Love Boat,
but this?

404
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,845
What is this?

405
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,041
Mr. Vanderhoff,
this is your audience.

406
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,607
They're the same kids
that line up at Noah's Arcade.

407
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:07,982
It looks so cheesy.

408
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,452
That's where
I come in.

409
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,955
Russell's
our best producer.

410
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,457
He does Chicago P.M.
with Elaine Ronkey,

411
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,962
Sunshine Saturday,
The African-American Digest.

412
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,155
Never heard of that.

413
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,162
It's on very late.

414
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,425
It won several awards.

415
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,091
I think I'll stick
with Love Boat.

416
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,294
If I may,

417
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,394
speaking from
a producer / director standpoint,

418
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,372
kids can relate
to this show.

419
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,873
These guys
aren't phonies.

420
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,469
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

421
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,979
Kids know dick.

422
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,981
I watch them
in my arcades.

423
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,983
They stand like
laboratory rats

424
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,985
hitting the feeder bar
to get food pellets.

425
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,284
As long as they pump in quarters,
who gives a shit?

426
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,024
Let me ask you something.

427
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,220
What's your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

428
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,732
Well, uh, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

429
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,734
Like, we have a new game
called Zantar.

430
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,736
Zantar is a gelatinous cube

431
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,238
that eats warriors
in a medieval village.

432
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,740
Every time
it eats a chieftain

433
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,106
you ascend
to a higher level.

434
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,112
Beauty part is you can't
get to the next level.

435
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,011
The kids keep
coughing up quarters.

436
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,709
Gelatinous cube
eats village...

437
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,217
I think it's terrific.

438
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,219
You know, I know nothing
about video games.

439
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,016
I found what you
just said riveting.

440
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,852
Well, I do
my own commercials.

441
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,050
I did not know that.

442
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,150
I don't mention the games
in the commercials

443
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,561
because the technology moves
much faster than the advertising.

444
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,620
I did not realize that.

445
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,360
Russell, did you
realize that?

446
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,958
No, I did not
realize that.

447
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,798
So, Mr. Vanderhoff,

448
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,135
let me see if I'm
hearing you correctly.

449
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,640
Are you saying
that if you had a spot,

450
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,142
say on a weekly show,

451
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,144
that you could
come on the show

452
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,611
and update the kids

453
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,910
on exactly what was new
in your arcade?

454
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,781
Yeah, that's it.

455
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,784
I'm impressed.

456
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,184
Wow!

457
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,748
Noah's Arcade presents
Wayne's World.

458
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,759
I think
that's brilliant.

459
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,192
Brilliant.

460
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:57,854
Well, thank you.

461
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,864
We'll get right to work
on this.

462
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,797
We'll send the contracts
over to your office.

463
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,300
We'll be in touch.

464
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,802
Oh.

465
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,804
I'd like
to think about this.

466
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,806
Oh, of course you would.

467
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,842
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

468
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,643
She'll validate.

469
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,043
Thank you.

470
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,912
He's in.

471
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,627
Stop it!
You're scaring me.

472
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,129
Oh, cool. You're learning
Cassandra's language.

473
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:36,133
I've never seen you so mental
over a girl before.

474
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,669
You going to marry her?

475
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,400
Marriage is punishment
for shoplifting in some countries.

476
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,736
O.K., you passed inspection.

477
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,741
All right.

478
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,243
Just barely.

479
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,748
Uh, O.K., that's 42.57, Wayne...
parts and labor.

480
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,180
No way.

481
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,182
Brutal.

482
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,185
Oh, O.K.
There you go.

483
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,686
All right,
we got it.

484
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,652
That's not enough.

485
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,654
What?

486
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,655
We got... that.

487
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,158
That's good,
but I need more.

488
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,524
Oh, man!
Why don't you use a gun?

489
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,358
It's not my fault.
Come on.

490
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,228
I suppose it's
society's fault?

491
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,231
More.

492
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:10,967
Cool.

493
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,230
All right.

494
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,205
Here's an extra dollar.

495
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,676
You guys should have been
at Gasworks on Friday.

496
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,178
Yeah, we were there.

497
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,441
There was this band...
Crucial Taunt...

498
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,313
They had this megababe
for a lead singer. Unreal!

499
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,818
Phil, we were there.

500
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,354
Have you gone mental?
Hello?

501
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,686
I think we should go now.

502
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,690
Here you go.

503
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:34,895
Cool!

504
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,746
You think it's wise
to sell a show we don't own?

505
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,748
By tonight, we will.

506
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,182
Ah!

507
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,724
Excuse me.

508
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:07,727
Do you know where
we could find Wayne Campbell?

509
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:09,228
That'd be privileged
information.

510
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:11,697
We just want to know
where they broadcast from.

511
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,700
Are you a friend
or a relative?

512
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:15,827
We're neither.

513
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:20,335
Russell, I may not have
grown up around here,

514
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,342
but I understand these people.

515
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,745
This must be the place.

516
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:32,650
O.K., we're just about
out of time, right?

517
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,280
But first let's give
a Wayne's World salute

518
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,790
to the Guess jeans girl
Claudia Schiffer.

519
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:38,790
Schwing!

520
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,053
Schwing!

521
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:42,095
Tent pole!
She's a babe.

522
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:44,154
She's magically
babe-licious.

523
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:47,166
She tested very high
on the strokability scale.

524
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:48,394
Mmrreowww!

525
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,130
Ssss.

526
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,535
Are you through yet?

527
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:53,539
I'm getting tired
of holding this.

528
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,541
Yeah, that's
what she said.

529
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:01,714
O.K., so, Claudia Schiffer,
we salute you.

530
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,613
- Scha-wing!
- Scha-wing!

531
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:06,016
That's all the time
we have this week.

532
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,349
Until then, good night.

533
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:08,718
Party on, Wayne.

534
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,087
Wayne's World
Wayne's World

535
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,250
Party time

536
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:13,520
Excellent

537
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,256
And... we're clear.

538
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,198
O.K. Excellent show,
everyone.

539
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,758
Excellent.

540
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:24,771
Great show.

541
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,670
Wayne, Benjamin Kane.

542
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:29,141
Regional program director
for Oliver Communications.

543
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,302
Oh, hello.

544
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:32,778
I'm Russell Finley.
We spoke earlier today. Hi.

545
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:35,281
Maybe we can go somewhere
and get acquainted.

546
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,408
Russell,
get to know the crew.

547
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:38,918
You know anywhere nice?

548
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:40,578
Hi.

549
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:41,951
Hi.

550
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:47,760
Let me get this
out of the way...

551
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,056
I'm a big fan.

552
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,324
You are?

553
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:54,391
As I see it, your show's
capable of so much more.

554
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:55,901
We'll try harder, O.K.?

555
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,904
Give us a second chance.

556
00:23:57,972 --> 00:24:00,406
Don't cancel us
without a second chance.

557
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:02,840
Garth, relax, all right?
Your pills?

558
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,343
He can't cancel us.

559
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:06,505
We're on public access.

560
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,013
Can I be honest?

561
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:10,550
My job, it's usually
such a bore,

562
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:13,178
but the other day something
incredible happened.

563
00:24:13,254 --> 00:24:14,118
What happened?

564
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,450
Noah Vanderhoff,

565
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,458
owner of the largest
video arcade chain in Chicago,

566
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:19,925
is in my office

567
00:24:19,994 --> 00:24:22,360
asking me what's with
this show Wayne's World

568
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,863
I hear so much about?

569
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,990
I have your shows on tape.

570
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,533
I said I'm a fan.

571
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,535
I put a show in.

572
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,662
He literally jumped
out of his seat.

573
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:32,797
- Cool.
- Cool.

574
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,807
He wants to sponsor
the show,

575
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,809
put you on our station,

576
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,777
and pay you
a huge salary.

577
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:41,144
He doesn't realize
you're both artists.

578
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,648
You're not interested
in money.

579
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:44,513
No, we're not
interested in money.

580
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,519
That's what I told him.

581
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,522
But he said take them
two cashier's checks anyway

582
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,285
so they know I'm serious.

583
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,519
I may be wasting my time,

584
00:24:53,594 --> 00:24:55,994
but here I am
with the contract

585
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,690
and two cashier's checks

586
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:00,859
for $5,000 each.

587
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:02,596
Exsqueeze me?

588
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,160
Baking powder?

589
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:07,173
You're going to pay us
for doing Wayne's World?

590
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:08,503
Give me the word.

591
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:10,043
I'll tear up
these checks.

592
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:12,302
No! No!

593
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:15,174
He shoots,
he scores!

594
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,484
Want to look
at the contracts?

595
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:19,484
Yes.

596
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:20,986
Do you have a lawyer?

597
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:22,488
Yes. Uh... no.

598
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:24,490
We're between
lawyers right now.

599
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,527
Our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly.

600
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:30,496
That's right. I walked
right into that office,

601
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:33,226
I grabbed him
by his big fat head,

602
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,737
and I said I'm not going to jail
for you or anybody.

603
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:39,932
Exactly.

604
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:45,237
Can I have an opportunity
to peruse that contract

605
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:46,939
before we sign it?

606
00:25:48,282 --> 00:25:49,476
Hmm.

607
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,744
Yes.

608
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:53,218
Yes.

609
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:55,585
I like what
you've done here.

610
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,283
Ah. Hmm.

611
00:25:57,358 --> 00:25:58,655
Yes.

612
00:25:58,726 --> 00:25:59,920
Yes.

613
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:01,928
Um, I dropped my pen.

614
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,930
I'm not so sure about...

615
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,898
Oh, I see. I see.

616
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:08,400
Hi. Um, does this seem weird?

617
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:10,403
Why does this guy
have contracts?

618
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:11,904
Ever see
The Twilight Zone

619
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:13,906
where the guy
signed a contract,

620
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:17,410
they cut out his tongue,
put it in a jar,

621
00:26:17,478 --> 00:26:18,911
and it wouldn't die?

622
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:22,437
It grew and pulsated
and gave birth to baby tongues.

623
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:24,780
Pretty cool, huh?
I got to go.

624
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:25,944
I like this part.

625
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,786
I feel we can work with you
on this project.

626
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:33,691
You've made Mr. Vanderhoff
a very happy man.

627
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,861
To Wayne's World.

628
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:40,230
- To Wayne's World.
- To Wayne's World.

629
00:26:40,301 --> 00:26:41,996
We got $5,000

630
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,969
We got $5,000

631
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:45,972
We got $5,000

632
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,065
We got $5,000

633
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:50,110
- Hey, Wayne.
- Check it out.

634
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:52,111
We got $5,000

635
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,840
We got $5,000

636
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:03,114
Ain't got no reason

637
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,454
For reaction

638
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:06,618
Party!

639
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:07,786
Whoo!

640
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:11,388
Ain't got no reason
for distraction

641
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,524
Great party, huh, guys?

642
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:19,462
Love the way
that you love me, baby

643
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,873
Love the way
that you stare

644
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,672
Uh-oh. Stacy alert.

645
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:30,249
We're being pulled in
by her tractor beam.

646
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,750
I got to go.

647
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,912
We got to go.

648
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:36,786
Ooh, if you dare

649
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,426
Don't be afraid
to love me

650
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,293
Anywhere

651
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:49,263
Dream weaver

652
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:54,467
I believe you can get me
through the night

653
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:58,033
Don't be afraid
to love me

654
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:01,946
Anywhere

655
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:05,110
Won't you touch me

656
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:10,555
Won't you love me

657
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,886
Just let me know

658
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,722
God, she's amazing.

659
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:16,285
I'll be there

660
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:19,799
Wayne, Wayne, Garth told me
about the show, man.

661
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,300
I love you, man.

662
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,303
Yeah, and I love you,
too, Terry.

663
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:27,272
No, I mean it, man.
I love you.

664
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:28,774
No, I mean it.

665
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,275
I love you.

666
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:32,778
No, you don't, man.

667
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:36,805
Why don't you love me

668
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,317
Garth, come over here.

669
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,853
Terry has something
to say to you.

670
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,980
I love you, man.

671
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:44,615
Thank you.

672
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:49,220
Oh

673
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:52,424
I'll be there

674
00:28:52,499 --> 00:29:00,313
Oh, I'll be there

675
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,178
Oh, I'll be there

676
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,902
Your vocals
are incredible.

677
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,231
Thanks.

678
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,738
You have a very
interesting look.

679
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,240
Aha.

680
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,243
Oh, I'm not trying
to pick up on you.

681
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,471
Good thing.

682
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:34,480
No, I'm producing
a television show.

683
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:36,516
It's in Chicago.
Very late night.

684
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,483
We're looking
for a musical act.

685
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:39,985
Here's my card.

686
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:42,988
Is there a number
I can reach you at?

687
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:45,490
We got fliers at the door.

688
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:52,189
Hello.

689
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:55,826
So hot and bothered

690
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:59,804
Hot and bothered

691
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,303
Wayne?

692
00:30:03,376 --> 00:30:04,536
Hi, Wayne.

693
00:30:04,611 --> 00:30:06,044
Hi.

694
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:15,952
Want to go somewhere
and talk?

695
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,614
Sure.

696
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:29,268
What's going on in there?

697
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:30,769
Just a minute.

698
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:33,271
We'd like to go
to the bathroom, please.

699
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,035
In this century.

700
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:37,042
How long
you been waiting?

701
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,078
Like an hour now.

702
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:40,738
Uh...

703
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:41,974
Hi, Garth.

704
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,242
Uh...

705
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:44,476
hi.

706
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,984
I'm looking for Wayne.

707
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,953
He seems to be going through
this difficult phase.

708
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:50,319
You know what I think?

709
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,187
That you're mental?

710
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,693
You know him best.
What should I do?

711
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,888
Get over it. Go out
with somebody else.

712
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:59,431
Get over it. Go out
with somebody else.

713
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:00,659
Yeah, thanks.
O.K., great.

714
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:03,595
Hi.

715
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,305
So who's
this guy Benjamin?

716
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:10,639
Only one of the most
important producers in television.

717
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,200
He's ahead of his time.

718
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,712
We've signed with him.

719
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,213
He's based in Chicago.

720
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:17,216
He's interested
in the band.

721
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:19,218
Of course.
I love your band.

722
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:20,719
You guys wail.

723
00:31:20,787 --> 00:31:21,947
Thanks.

724
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:24,354
You guys kick ass.
You're Double Live Gonzo!

725
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,892
Intensity in Ten Cities.
Live at Budokan.

726
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,895
If you got a break,
you could make it.

727
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:31,396
And if a frog
had wings,

728
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:34,399
he wouldn't bump his ass
when he hopped.

729
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:35,559
Interesting.

730
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:37,569
Where did you
learn English?

731
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:38,797
College...

732
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:40,999
and the Police Academy movies.

733
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,371
Ah.

734
00:31:44,578 --> 00:31:45,738
Cassandra...

735
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,746
I've got something
I want to say to you.

736
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:58,691
Campbell, that's amazing.

737
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:02,319
You learned to say
I look pretty in Cantonese.

738
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,067
Hi, Wayne.

739
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,669
Hello, Stacy.

740
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:22,214
Sit right here.

741
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:36,795
Kiss me.

742
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:26,906
You make me laugh.

743
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,971
Can I call you?

744
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,983
Anytime.

745
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,483
Look out!

746
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,353
- Aah!
- Aah!

747
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:47,989
Oops.

748
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:24,829
Sometimes I wish
I could boldly go

749
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:27,338
where no man's
gone before,

750
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:29,841
but I'll probably
stay in Aurora.

751
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:33,011
What are you
thinking about?

752
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,273
Cassandra.

753
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:35,712
She's a fox.

754
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,307
In French,
she'd be called la renard.

755
00:34:38,385 --> 00:34:41,354
She'd be hunted with only
her cunning to protect her.

756
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:42,854
She's a babe.

757
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:44,287
She's a robo-babe.

758
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:47,258
In Latin, she'd be called
babia majora.

759
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:48,760
If she were
a president,

760
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:50,227
she'd be
Babe-raham Lincoln.

761
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,738
Did you ever find
Bugs Bunny attractive

762
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,742
when he'd put on a dress
and play a girl bunny?

763
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,573
No.

764
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,043
No.

765
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,609
Neither did I.

766
00:35:14,687 --> 00:35:16,120
I was just asking.

767
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,022
O.K., O.K.,
keep looking up.

768
00:35:20,093 --> 00:35:21,526
O.K.

769
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:33,631
- Aah!
- Aah!

770
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:35,230
Whoo!

771
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:36,536
Whoo-hoo!

772
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:38,804
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

773
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,342
Guys, I will be talking
to the cameraman

774
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,853
on the headset.

775
00:35:48,922 --> 00:35:50,822
Terry will give you
hand cues.

776
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,323
Excuse me, Russell,

777
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,327
but I believe
I requested the hand job.

778
00:35:56,896 --> 00:35:58,693
Let's go on.

779
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,461
The cue is...
watch carefully...

780
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:07,102
5... 4... 3...

781
00:36:09,976 --> 00:36:11,443
You didn't say 2 or 1.

782
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:13,206
You don't say 2 or 1.

783
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,837
Why not?

784
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:17,212
You just don't, O.K.?

785
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:19,979
Now, it goes...

786
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,787
5... 4... 3...

787
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:32,331
Good. O.K., good.

788
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,366
- Ow!
- Ow!

789
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,867
We're ready
for rehearsal,

790
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:38,062
unless there are
any questions.

791
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:41,835
Yeah, um... does this
seem weird to anybody else?

792
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,934
I mean, we're looking down
on Wayne's basement,

793
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,844
only that's not
Wayne's basement.

794
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,347
Isn't that weird?

795
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,507
That's twisted.

796
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,517
That's weird, man,
that's weird.

797
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,145
Garth, that was a haiku.

798
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,851
- Russell.
- Control room.

799
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,393
Oh, hello, Benjamin.

800
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,395
Just finishing up
with the Vanderhoffs.

801
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,397
They'd like to look
at rehearsal

802
00:37:05,465 --> 00:37:09,196
and make sure we're
not wasting their money.

803
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,965
Not a good idea, sir.

804
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:13,300
Great.

805
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:14,897
Come in.

806
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:16,703
Your landing gear is down.

807
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,175
Just put that down.

808
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,336
Ow.

809
00:37:19,412 --> 00:37:20,845
Just go away, guys.

810
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:22,245
Hey, hey, hey!

811
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:24,408
Russell's excited
you're coming to the studio.

812
00:37:24,484 --> 00:37:26,111
Oh, the studio.

813
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:28,120
That's where
the magic happens.

814
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:29,348
You've worked
in television?

815
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:30,855
No, I watch a lot.

816
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:33,256
Of course you do.
You're creative.

817
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:35,794
She came up with the name
Noah's Arcade.

818
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:38,854
I just opened my mouth
and out it came.

819
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:42,301
You're a lucky man,
Mr. Vanderhoff.

820
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:45,628
Bring in the blue screen.

821
00:37:45,705 --> 00:37:47,536
Let's try one.

822
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:50,201
Ready to cue
Wayne and Garth, and go.

823
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:51,868
O.K.

824
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:55,243
In 5... 4... 3...

825
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,006
Good, Terry.

826
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:00,109
Wayne, Garth,
don't count along.

827
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:02,552
We see your mouths moving.
Again.

828
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:05,921
In 5... 4... 3...

829
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,254
Guys?

830
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,520
You're nodding.

831
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:09,856
Once again, Terry.

832
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:14,923
In 5... 4... 3... 2...

833
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,434
Welcome to Wayne's World.
Party on, Garth.

834
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,529
Party on, Wayne.

835
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:23,131
We got a new feature
on Wayne's World

836
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:26,144
which allows us to travel
through time and space.

837
00:38:26,212 --> 00:38:28,612
It's called chromakey,
and it's really handy

838
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,945
if you want
to go to... New York.

839
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,006
We're in New York!

840
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:34,713
I got a gun. Let's go
to a Broadway show.

841
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:36,379
I guess kids get this?

842
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:37,855
Oh, they love it.

843
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,892
Or maybe you prefer Hawaii.

844
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,894
Muka laka hickey.
Come on, you wanna lay me.

845
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:44,395
Pass the poi. Mahalo.

846
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:47,399
Or say you want
to go to Texas.

847
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:51,096
Howdy, partners.
Let's raise and rope broncos.

848
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,695
Let's go down
to the floor.

849
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:55,104
Howdy, y'all.

850
00:38:55,174 --> 00:38:58,405
Or imagine being magically
whisked away to...

851
00:38:58,478 --> 00:39:00,207
Delaware.

852
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,837
Hi.

853
00:39:01,914 --> 00:39:03,973
I'm in Delaware.

854
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,608
Noah and Mimi Vanderhoff,

855
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:08,620
say hello to Wayne Campbell
and Garth Algar.

856
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:10,121
Pleasure to meet you.

857
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:11,622
Nice to meet you.

858
00:39:11,691 --> 00:39:15,127
Garth, how do you like
being in a real studio?

859
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:18,061
It's like a new
pair of underwear.

860
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:20,361
At first
it's constrictive,

861
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:24,335
but after a while,
it becomes a part of you.

862
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:27,830
I got to go.

863
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,102
O.K.

864
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:32,337
No, no, no. Please.

865
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,244
Wayne, I used to be
in meat packing.

866
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:36,838
Lips and hooves.

867
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,317
One day, I had
a four-hour layover in Tulsa.

868
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:43,321
These kids in the airport
kept pumping quarters

869
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:45,357
into a game called Pong.

870
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,483
They must've gone
through 50 bucks.

871
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,118
I sat there watching

872
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:52,130
and said, "Hell, I'm in
the wrong business."

873
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:55,463
15 years later,
I'm a millionaire.

874
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:58,860
It's so huge.

875
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,098
Thanks.

876
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:03,241
Do I frighten you?

877
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:04,503
No.

878
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,738
Do you want me to?

879
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:09,008
Noah, I love you
on that couch.

880
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,048
You think?

881
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,243
Noah does
all his own commercials.

882
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,287
Yeah, I got a new one
where I rap.

883
00:40:15,354 --> 00:40:18,414
Come bust a move
where the games are played

884
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:19,958
It's chill,
it's fresh

885
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,493
It's Noah's Arcade

886
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:23,586
What do you think of that?

887
00:40:25,064 --> 00:40:26,554
I'd have to say...

888
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,463
ass sphincter says what?

889
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:30,660
What?

890
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:32,636
A sphincter says what?

891
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,298
What?

892
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:37,137
Exactly.

893
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,837
We've got a lunch.

894
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,879
That's what I think of it.

895
00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:42,380
It's been a pleasure.

896
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:45,246
May I say I've had
a thrilling day.

897
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,376
You may.

898
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:47,544
Shall we?

899
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,589
And may I say
your wife's a babe.

900
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,748
Thank you.

901
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,189
We have a table.

902
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:07,571
What is it, girl?

903
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:10,901
Aliens have
kidnapped Wayne?

904
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:14,375
Oh, I misunderstood.
Wayne's outside.

905
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:15,914
Thanks, girl.

906
00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:23,381
O.K.

907
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:26,425
Game on.

908
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:27,720
Game on.

909
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:29,055
Game on.

910
00:41:32,665 --> 00:41:34,360
He shoots, he scores!

911
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:35,832
1 for 1.

912
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:37,130
Crowd is going wild!

913
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:41,096
- Car.
- Car.

914
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:44,737
Game on.

915
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,072
Game on.

916
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:50,281
O.K., let's go.

917
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,978
Worsley cuts down the angle.

918
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,452
Gretzky shoots!

919
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:58,012
Oh, Gretzky is denied!

920
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,524
Choked on the open net.

921
00:42:00,593 --> 00:42:02,424
Wayne?

922
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:03,553
Yeah?

923
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:06,097
Do you feel Benjamin's
not one of us?

924
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:08,224
Good call.
It's as if Benjamin

925
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:10,701
wants us to be liked
by everyone.

926
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,204
Led Zeppelin didn't write tunes
that everyone liked.

927
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:15,570
They left that
to the Bee Gees.

928
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:18,670
- Car.
- Car.

929
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:23,813
Game on.

930
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:25,077
Game on.

931
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:30,854
Uh-oh. Incoming.
Stacy, 10:00.

932
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,550
Hi, Wayne.

933
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,253
Hi.

934
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:41,930
Hey, are you all right?

935
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:45,334
Oops.

936
00:42:45,404 --> 00:42:46,871
And she's O.K.

937
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:50,273
Game on.

938
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:51,901
Yeah, game on.

939
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:08,993
You know, Garth,

940
00:43:09,061 --> 00:43:11,996
you and I have
never really talked.

941
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:14,760
O.K.

942
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:18,770
You know, I love
what you do on the show.

943
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:22,774
I look at you,
and I just laugh and laugh.

944
00:43:22,842 --> 00:43:23,900
Uh-huh.

945
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,910
Let me run this by you

946
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,946
because you're a sharp guy.

947
00:43:28,014 --> 00:43:29,447
I'm thinking about
giving Vanderhoff

948
00:43:29,515 --> 00:43:31,415
a weekly interview
on the show.

949
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,419
How would you feel
about making a change?

950
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,954
We fear change.

951
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,273
Cassandra,
I have to say it...

952
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,740
You look excellent.

953
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,744
Thanks. I've been so busy
lately with my band,

954
00:43:59,812 --> 00:44:01,837
I thought I was
getting meningitis.

955
00:44:01,914 --> 00:44:05,042
I thought I had mono
for an entire year.

956
00:44:05,117 --> 00:44:08,052
It turned out I was
just really bored.

957
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,553
You're so fine

958
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:11,590
You're so fine,
you blow my mind

959
00:44:11,657 --> 00:44:12,988
Excuse me?

960
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:16,495
I'm sorry. It's the last song
I heard this morning.

961
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:18,496
I hate when that happens.

962
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:20,031
Hey, Mickey,
you're so fine

963
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:20,997
You're so fine,
you blow my mind

964
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:22,193
Hey, Mickey

965
00:44:22,268 --> 00:44:23,895
Hey, Mickey

966
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:25,300
Hey, Mickey,
you're so fine

967
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,531
You're so fine,
you blow my mind

968
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:28,698
Hey, Mickey

969
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:33,745
I think I'm going
to put on some tunes.

970
00:44:33,813 --> 00:44:36,748
Hey, when did you
get the CD player?

971
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:39,216
When we got the money.

972
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:42,083
So big boy said
you are bad news

973
00:44:42,154 --> 00:44:45,555
We're tired of mama
bein' confused

974
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:49,685
It's plain to see
we rock 'n' roll

975
00:44:49,762 --> 00:44:52,094
If you don't like it,
got to move

976
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,294
There it is...

977
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:07,893
Excalibur.

978
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,872
Wow. '64 Fender Stratocaster
in classic white

979
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,909
with triple single coil pickups
and a whammy bar.

980
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,410
Pre-CBS Fender
corporate buy-out.

981
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:18,311
I'd raise the bridge,
file down the nut,

982
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:21,407
and take the buzz
out of the low "E."

983
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:22,917
God, I love this woman.

984
00:45:24,153 --> 00:45:26,087
Hi, Garth.
Where's the clerk?

985
00:45:26,155 --> 00:45:29,556
I know. I'll use
the "May I help you" riff.

986
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,725
May I help you?

987
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:37,231
Yes, my good man.

988
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,758
I'd like to look at this
Fender Stratocaster, please.

989
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:42,304
Oh, really? Again?

990
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,101
Yes.

991
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:01,049
Careful.

992
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:11,566
No Stairway.

993
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:13,534
Denied!

994
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:57,440
Wow.

995
00:46:57,513 --> 00:47:00,311
You're... amazing, dude.

996
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:01,907
Thanks.

997
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:04,009
I like to play.

998
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:08,756
Excuse me. Wayne.

999
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:12,090
Can I put the Fender
back now, please?

1000
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:14,391
Not today, my good man.
I'm feeling saucy.

1001
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,433
I think I'm going to buy it.

1002
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,060
Do you accept... cash?
Cha-ching.

1003
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:31,445
Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

1004
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:33,982
Yes. Briefly.
He was not very receptive.

1005
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,486
Oh, really? Well, I'll explain
to him that it's not a choice,

1006
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,453
that it's in his contract.

1007
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:42,491
Oh. Well, Wayne
will understand that right away.

1008
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:45,159
Not.

1009
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:49,519
Excuse me.

1010
00:47:49,653 --> 00:47:51,985
I mean, there's two
Darrin Stevens, right?

1011
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:53,647
Dick York, Dick Sargent.

1012
00:47:53,724 --> 00:47:57,455
Yeah, right, as if
we wouldn't notice.

1013
00:47:57,527 --> 00:47:58,960
Well, hold on.

1014
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:01,156
Dick York. Dick Sargent.

1015
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:03,290
Sergeant York.
Wow, that's weird.

1016
00:48:06,203 --> 00:48:07,135
Wayne.

1017
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,839
Listen, we need to have
a talk about Vanderhoff.

1018
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:12,603
The fact is,
he's the sponsor

1019
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:14,974
and you signed a contract
guaranteeing him

1020
00:48:15,045 --> 00:48:17,809
certain concessions, one of them
being a spot on the show.

1021
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:20,975
That's where I see things
just a little differently.

1022
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:25,420
Contract or no, I will
not bow to any sponsor.

1023
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,514
I'm sorry
you feel that way,

1024
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:29,786
but basically,
it's the nature of the beast.

1025
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,794
Maybe I'm wrong
on this one,

1026
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:35,320
but for me, the beast
doesn't include selling out.

1027
00:48:38,735 --> 00:48:41,260
Garth, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

1028
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:48,867
It's, like, people only do things
because they get paid,

1029
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:51,039
and that's
just really sad.

1030
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:56,383
I can't talk about it anymore.
It's giving me a headache.

1031
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:58,387
Here. Take two of these.

1032
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:01,988
Ah. Nuprin.

1033
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:03,890
Little. Yellow.
Different.

1034
00:49:03,961 --> 00:49:06,395
You can stay here
in the big leagues

1035
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:08,055
and play by the rules

1036
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:10,691
or go back to
the farm club in Aurora.

1037
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:12,234
It's your choice.

1038
00:49:12,302 --> 00:49:15,738
Yes. And it's the choice
of a new generation.

1039
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:28,475
And her name was Cassandra

1040
00:49:28,553 --> 00:49:29,542
Yeah.

1041
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:34,521
Anything wrong, Davey?

1042
00:49:34,592 --> 00:49:37,026
Yeah. I got paid today.

1043
00:49:37,095 --> 00:49:39,529
Oh, yeah, I know
what that's like.

1044
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:42,498
No. You don't understand.
They laid me off.

1045
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:44,535
I got one of these.

1046
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:46,365
I know how that feels.

1047
00:49:46,438 --> 00:49:48,838
Know what
I'd like to do?

1048
00:49:48,907 --> 00:49:51,273
Yeah, I know what
you'd like to do...

1049
00:49:51,343 --> 00:49:53,277
Find the guy
that did it,

1050
00:49:53,345 --> 00:49:55,313
rip his still beating
heart out of his chest

1051
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,941
and show him how black it is
before he dies.

1052
00:49:59,017 --> 00:50:00,780
Actually, I was thinking

1053
00:50:00,852 --> 00:50:03,821
about filing a grievance
with the union.

1054
00:50:03,888 --> 00:50:06,288
Well, the world's
a twisted place.

1055
00:50:10,295 --> 00:50:11,227
Hi.

1056
00:50:11,296 --> 00:50:13,264
- Hey, Garth.
- How's it going?

1057
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:14,263
Good.

1058
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:19,428
Hey. There she is.

1059
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:25,975
Aah!

1060
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:30,947
I must've slipped.

1061
00:50:32,317 --> 00:50:34,410
Wayne, um...
what do you do

1062
00:50:34,486 --> 00:50:37,080
if every time you see this
one incredible woman,

1063
00:50:37,155 --> 00:50:39,123
you think
you're going to hurl?

1064
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,589
I say hurl.

1065
00:50:40,658 --> 00:50:43,422
If you blow chunks
and she comes back, she's yours.

1066
00:50:43,495 --> 00:50:45,429
If you spew
and she bolts,

1067
00:50:45,497 --> 00:50:47,863
it was never
meant to be.

1068
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:50,926
Oh... I'm not ready yet.

1069
00:50:51,002 --> 00:50:53,436
I got to be comfortable
with me first.

1070
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:56,474
Why don't you just go talk to her?

1071
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:59,442
Talk to her?
Talk to her?

1072
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:12,823
Foxy.

1073
00:51:16,861 --> 00:51:18,192
Foxy.

1074
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:22,298
Uh, you know
you are a

1075
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:23,800
Cute little
heartbreaker

1076
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:24,800
Ha!

1077
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:26,802
Foxy.

1078
00:51:27,872 --> 00:51:28,839
Yeah.

1079
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,838
And you know
you are a

1080
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,208
Sweet little lovemaker

1081
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:35,473
Ha!

1082
00:51:35,547 --> 00:51:36,673
Foxy.

1083
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:42,311
I wanna take you home

1084
00:51:42,387 --> 00:51:44,378
Yeah

1085
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:48,620
I won't do you no harm

1086
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:52,225
You've got to be
all mine

1087
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:53,889
All mine

1088
00:51:53,965 --> 00:51:56,195
Ooh! Foxy lady

1089
00:51:57,469 --> 00:51:59,733
Here I come, baby.

1090
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:01,431
Im comin' to get ya.

1091
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:03,906
Why don't you just
go talk to her?

1092
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:05,408
Go talk to her?

1093
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:06,944
Go talk to her?

1094
00:52:08,313 --> 00:52:09,245
Garth?

1095
00:52:14,986 --> 00:52:16,010
Camera one.

1096
00:52:16,087 --> 00:52:17,679
Camera two.

1097
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:19,347
Camera one.

1098
00:52:19,424 --> 00:52:20,789
Camera two.

1099
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,952
Camera one, camera two.

1100
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:23,994
Camera one,

1101
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:24,994
camera two.

1102
00:52:25,063 --> 00:52:26,997
Ha ha ha! Don't.

1103
00:52:27,065 --> 00:52:27,997
Camera one,

1104
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:28,998
camera two.

1105
00:52:31,402 --> 00:52:34,371
Tell me... when that
first show is over,

1106
00:52:34,439 --> 00:52:37,567
will you still love me when I'm
an incredibly humongoid, giant star?

1107
00:52:37,642 --> 00:52:39,075
Yeah.

1108
00:52:39,144 --> 00:52:42,875
What about when I'm in my
hanging-out-with-Ravi-Shankar phase?

1109
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:44,141
Yeah.

1110
00:52:44,215 --> 00:52:47,343
And when I'm in my
carbohydrate-sequin-jumpsuit,

1111
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:49,386
young-girls-
in-white-cotton-panties,

1112
00:52:49,454 --> 00:52:51,922
waking-up-in-a-pool-
of-your-own-vomit,

1113
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:54,891
bloated, purple,
dead-on-a-toilet phase?

1114
00:52:54,959 --> 00:52:55,891
Yeah.

1115
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,588
O.K. Party. Bonus.

1116
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:01,464
Yeah?

1117
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:02,966
Oh, hi, Anthony.

1118
00:53:03,034 --> 00:53:04,296
Who's Anthony?
Who's Anthony?

1119
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:05,301
My drummer.

1120
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,302
O.K.

1121
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:08,697
You what?

1122
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:10,968
No. I told you next week

1123
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:12,976
we'll be doing
a music video.

1124
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:18,106
Do you mind?
This is business.

1125
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:23,481
Hey, you want to be a busboy
the rest of your life?

1126
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:25,989
Well, then talk
to your boss.

1127
00:53:29,928 --> 00:53:32,988
Look, this guy Benjamin's putting up
serious money for this thing.

1128
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:35,032
Yeah.

1129
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:37,533
Happy birthday

1130
00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:39,832
Mr. President

1131
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:43,334
Happy birthday

1132
00:53:43,408 --> 00:53:45,740
To you

1133
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:50,307
Work it out, O.K.?

1134
00:53:50,381 --> 00:53:52,747
Just... no,
just be there.

1135
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:54,614
O.K. Bye.

1136
00:53:54,686 --> 00:53:56,278
You asshole!

1137
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:58,083
Oh!

1138
00:53:58,156 --> 00:53:59,248
Whoo!

1139
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:06,525
Excellent.

1140
00:54:06,598 --> 00:54:09,590
Rrr! Rrska, rrska!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1141
00:54:12,337 --> 00:54:16,467
So motion to me

1142
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:22,104
That you wanted me

1143
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,478
Hey. All right.
Glad you could make it.

1144
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:25,675
Oh, wow.

1145
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,682
Yes.

1146
00:54:26,751 --> 00:54:27,843
Cool.

1147
00:54:28,953 --> 00:54:30,386
Yes. This is definitely

1148
00:54:30,455 --> 00:54:32,855
the type of place
I'm going to get

1149
00:54:32,924 --> 00:54:35,358
when I move out
of my parents' house.

1150
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:36,723
Oh, you have a terrace!

1151
00:54:36,794 --> 00:54:38,227
Yeah. Go on out.

1152
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:40,196
I'll get the Dom Perignon.

1153
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:44,929
What's goin' on...

1154
00:54:45,003 --> 00:54:46,436
What floor is this?

1155
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:49,234
Um... the 23rd.

1156
00:54:49,307 --> 00:54:50,239
Oh.

1157
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:53,544
Oh.

1158
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,608
You know...

1159
00:54:56,681 --> 00:54:58,444
Cassandra...

1160
00:54:58,516 --> 00:54:59,949
from this height,

1161
00:55:00,018 --> 00:55:02,646
you could really
hawk a lugie on someone.

1162
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:10,158
I feel so free up here.

1163
00:55:10,228 --> 00:55:12,856
Costs a lot
to live this free.

1164
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,660
This might be a tangent, right,

1165
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:18,224
but it's something
I've been thinking about...

1166
00:55:18,303 --> 00:55:21,204
Hi. If I had a girl
like Cassandra,

1167
00:55:21,272 --> 00:55:23,206
I wouldn't bring her here.

1168
00:55:23,274 --> 00:55:25,242
I mean,
look at this place.

1169
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,279
This is a fully
functional babe lair.

1170
00:55:28,346 --> 00:55:30,780
Chicks are helpless
against its powers.

1171
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:33,043
Let's check it out.

1172
00:55:33,117 --> 00:55:35,979
I don't believe I've ever had
French champagne before.

1173
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:38,138
Oh, actually,
all champagne is French.

1174
00:55:38,215 --> 00:55:40,115
It's named
after the region.

1175
00:55:40,184 --> 00:55:42,277
Otherwise,
it's sparkling white wine.

1176
00:55:42,353 --> 00:55:43,547
Americans,
of course,

1177
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,814
don't recognize
the convention,

1178
00:55:44,888 --> 00:55:47,152
so they call all their
sparkling whites champagne,

1179
00:55:47,224 --> 00:55:49,158
even though by definition
they're not.

1180
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:52,889
Ah, yes. It's a lot like
Star Trek: The Next Generation.

1181
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,521
In many ways,
it's superior,

1182
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:57,226
but will never be as recognized
as the original.

1183
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:01,270
Aha. What's this?

1184
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:03,272
How To Pick Up Chicks.

1185
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,807
How To Meet Women.

1186
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:05,807
He's smooth.

1187
00:56:08,312 --> 00:56:09,244
Aha.

1188
00:56:10,781 --> 00:56:12,373
"Daily reminder...

1189
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:13,575
"Thursday.

1190
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,084
"Purchase feeble
public access cable show

1191
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:17,586
and exploit it."

1192
00:56:17,654 --> 00:56:21,613
Whoa. I feel sorry
for whoever that is.

1193
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:23,125
Let's look over here.

1194
00:56:31,568 --> 00:56:34,503
"Ribbed for her pleasure."

1195
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,402
Ewww!

1196
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:38,407
The show looks great.

1197
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:40,409
Mr. Vanderhoff's very excited.
I'm very excited.

1198
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:43,412
I think the show's
going to be a huge hit

1199
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,414
all over the Chicagoland area.

1200
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:48,076
I want you and Garth
to have these tickets

1201
00:56:48,152 --> 00:56:49,414
to Alice Cooper's concert

1202
00:56:49,486 --> 00:56:50,748
tomorrow night
in Milwaukee.

1203
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:52,755
Wow. Backstage passes.

1204
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:56,919
Whoa. All-access backstage
with Alice Cooper?

1205
00:56:56,994 --> 00:56:57,926
Thank you.

1206
00:56:57,995 --> 00:56:59,826
Take the day off.
Enjoy yourselves.

1207
00:56:59,897 --> 00:57:01,455
Well, what about Cassandra?

1208
00:57:01,532 --> 00:57:03,932
She and I
have work to do.

1209
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:05,491
Here's to your success.

1210
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:07,628
No. Here's to Benjamin.

1211
00:57:13,377 --> 00:57:15,937
Mmm... who wants
Chinese takeout?

1212
00:57:16,013 --> 00:57:18,038
I know a great place.

1213
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:20,948
I'll have the cream
of sum yung guy.

1214
00:57:21,018 --> 00:57:21,950
Mmm!

1215
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,455
Cassandra,
why don't you order?

1216
00:57:26,523 --> 00:57:29,458
No. I'm sure whatever
you order will be fine.

1217
00:57:29,526 --> 00:57:30,458
Oh. O.K.

1218
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:45,407
Mountain Dew.

1219
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:46,738
Pepsi Cola.

1220
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,410
This guy is good.

1221
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:55,418
Picked up a little Cantonese
while in the orient.

1222
00:57:55,486 --> 00:57:58,751
You sound a lot like you're from
Kowloon Bay as opposed to Hong Kong.

1223
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:01,017
I was born
in Kowloon Bay.

1224
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:02,649
There you have it.

1225
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:05,160
This guy's really good.

1226
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:12,599
Well, I want
to tell you about me

1227
00:58:15,272 --> 00:58:16,762
I asked you to stay

1228
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,936
And still you leave

1229
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:25,209
Well, I may look
lonely and blue

1230
00:58:25,282 --> 00:58:28,615
But I've been here
waitin' for you

1231
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,888
And I

1232
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:35,390
Want an answer or two

1233
00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:41,363
Why you wanna break
my heart?

1234
00:58:41,431 --> 00:58:45,765
Ooh, ooh, why you
wanna break my heart?

1235
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:49,829
Ooh, ooh, why you
wanna break my heart?

1236
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:54,207
Ooh, ooh, why you
wanna break my heart?

1237
00:58:55,279 --> 00:58:56,803
Sounds great!

1238
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,812
Thanks.

1239
00:58:57,881 --> 00:58:59,246
You got a minute?

1240
00:58:59,316 --> 00:59:01,250
Sure. You guys hang out.

1241
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:04,913
I came by to drop off
the contract for the video.

1242
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:07,422
Oh, great.
I never really got a chance

1243
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:09,925
to say thank you.
You've been very generous.

1244
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:11,426
It's been my pleasure.

1245
00:59:11,495 --> 00:59:13,929
Listen, I thought if
you were done here

1246
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:16,295
that maybe we could spend
the afternoon together.

1247
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:20,166
Take a long, long ride
with yourself

1248
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:22,967
We should be pretty
close to Milwaukee by now.

1249
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:28,600
Take a long, long ride
with yourself

1250
00:59:29,746 --> 00:59:31,941
Do you like
what you see...

1251
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:33,949
Look! There's
Shotz Brewery!

1252
00:59:34,017 --> 00:59:34,984
Cool!

1253
00:59:35,052 --> 00:59:36,883
1, 2, 3, 4,

1254
00:59:36,954 --> 00:59:38,888
5, 6, 7, 8...

1255
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:39,888
schlemiel,

1256
00:59:39,957 --> 00:59:40,889
schlemazel.

1257
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:43,483
Hausenpfeffer
Incorporated.

1258
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,993
We're gonna do it

1259
00:59:45,062 --> 00:59:46,086
- Aah!
- Aah!

1260
00:59:46,163 --> 00:59:48,757
Give us any chance,
we'll take it

1261
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:51,357
Read us any rule,
we'll break it

1262
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:55,496
We're gonna make
our dreams come true

1263
00:59:55,572 --> 00:59:57,062
Doin' it our way

1264
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,166
Nothing's gonna
turn us back now

1265
01:00:00,243 --> 01:00:03,144
Straight ahead
and on the track now

1266
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:07,115
We're gonna make
our dreams come true

1267
01:00:07,184 --> 01:00:08,617
Doin' it our way

1268
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:10,915
Hey, wait a minute.
What are we doing?

1269
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:14,583
Yeah! We got backstage passes
for Alice Cooper!

1270
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:19,123
Feed my Frankenstein

1271
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,474
Well, I ain't evil

1272
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:37,513
I'm just good-lookin'

1273
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:40,448
I started the fire

1274
01:00:40,517 --> 01:00:42,348
Baby, start cookin'

1275
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:44,580
I'm a hungry man

1276
01:00:44,655 --> 01:00:47,249
But I don't want pizza

1277
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:49,656
I'll blow down your house

1278
01:00:49,726 --> 01:00:51,921
And then I'm gonna eat ya

1279
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:54,623
Bring you to a simmer

1280
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:56,529
Right on time

1281
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,864
And run my greasy fingers

1282
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:01,733
Up your greasy spine

1283
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:06,469
Feed my Frankenstein

1284
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:08,943
Do you want to go backstage?

1285
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:10,741
She's a psycho

1286
01:01:10,814 --> 01:01:14,250
Yeah. Let's go back now
and beat the crowd.

1287
01:01:14,317 --> 01:01:15,716
Feed my Frankenstein

1288
01:01:15,786 --> 01:01:17,378
Hungry for love

1289
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:23,518
And it's feedin' time,
baby, whoa, whoa

1290
01:01:23,593 --> 01:01:25,151
Oh, yeah

1291
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:29,028
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein

1292
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:42,377
Where you going?

1293
01:01:42,446 --> 01:01:43,708
Got a pass.

1294
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,213
- Yay!
- Backstage passes, yeah!

1295
01:01:45,282 --> 01:01:46,715
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1296
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:48,546
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

1297
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:52,384
Feed my Frankenstein

1298
01:01:52,456 --> 01:01:55,391
Uh-oh. I think
we took a wrong turn,

1299
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:57,427
'cause we're outside now.

1300
01:01:57,494 --> 01:01:59,428
Whoa! Look!

1301
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:03,732
Is this Alice's limo?

1302
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,234
No. It belongs
to Frank Sharp,

1303
01:02:06,303 --> 01:02:07,736
head of Sharp Records.

1304
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:09,237
Good friend of Alice's.

1305
01:02:09,306 --> 01:02:11,240
Wow. That's, like, way bigger

1306
01:02:11,308 --> 01:02:13,242
than a normal size car.

1307
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,904
Well, it has to be.
He drives everywhere.

1308
01:02:15,979 --> 01:02:17,412
Hates to fly.

1309
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:19,915
He's going across
the country right now

1310
01:02:19,983 --> 01:02:22,918
to look for new acts
to sign to his label.

1311
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:24,578
Next stop is St. Louis.

1312
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:28,750
Then he'll come back through Chicago
on his way to Detroit.

1313
01:02:30,994 --> 01:02:32,018
Thanks.

1314
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:37,866
You know,
for a security guard,

1315
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:41,370
he had an awful lot of information,
don't you think?

1316
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:46,970
Thank you, Milwaukee!

1317
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:56,384
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ladies.

1318
01:02:56,453 --> 01:02:58,045
Sorry, ladies.
I'm sorry. No...

1319
01:02:58,121 --> 01:03:00,555
Oh, you got pass...
all right. Come on.

1320
01:03:00,624 --> 01:03:02,057
Let us through,
please!

1321
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,717
Can't let you in.
Sorry.

1322
01:03:03,794 --> 01:03:05,227
Please? Aw...

1323
01:03:07,464 --> 01:03:09,557
Alice. Is this cool?

1324
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:11,396
Yeah. Come on in.

1325
01:03:11,468 --> 01:03:13,060
Sorry to bother you,

1326
01:03:13,136 --> 01:03:16,401
but we had to tell you
how much we enjoyed the show,

1327
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:17,906
didn't we, Garth?

1328
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,202
Y-Y-Y...

1329
01:03:19,276 --> 01:03:20,470
Oh. Thanks.

1330
01:03:20,544 --> 01:03:22,559
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

1331
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:23,890
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

1332
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:26,896
My name is Wayne,
and this is Garth.

1333
01:03:26,964 --> 01:03:27,896
Ehhh...

1334
01:03:27,965 --> 01:03:30,229
Nice to meet you guys.

1335
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:34,032
So do you...
come to Milwaukee often?

1336
01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:37,738
Well, I'm a regular visitor here,

1337
01:03:37,808 --> 01:03:40,675
but Milwaukee has certainly
had its share of visitors.

1338
01:03:40,744 --> 01:03:42,336
The French missionaries
and explorers

1339
01:03:42,413 --> 01:03:45,075
were coming here as early
as the late 1600s

1340
01:03:45,149 --> 01:03:47,083
to trade with
the Native Americans.

1341
01:03:47,151 --> 01:03:49,244
Isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?

1342
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,753
Yes, Pete, it is.

1343
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:52,846
Actually,
it's pronounced meeleewahkay,

1344
01:03:52,923 --> 01:03:56,484
which is Algonquin
for the good land.

1345
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,357
I was not aware of that.

1346
01:03:58,429 --> 01:04:00,863
One of the most
interesting aspects of Milwaukee

1347
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:03,866
is the fact that it's
the only major American city

1348
01:04:03,934 --> 01:04:06,528
to have ever elected
three socialist mayors.

1349
01:04:06,603 --> 01:04:09,333
Does this guy
know how to party or what?

1350
01:04:09,406 --> 01:04:11,533
Huh? Huh?

1351
01:04:11,608 --> 01:04:12,575
Oh.

1352
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:16,272
O.K. Well, we got
to get going.

1353
01:04:16,347 --> 01:04:18,338
No. Stick around.
Hang out with us.

1354
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:23,579
Cool. Yeah, we'll stay and
hang around with youse...

1355
01:04:24,788 --> 01:04:26,221
with Alice Cooper.

1356
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:30,555
We're not worthy!

1357
01:04:30,627 --> 01:04:32,390
We're not worthy!

1358
01:04:32,463 --> 01:04:34,363
We're not worthy!

1359
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:36,194
We're scum!

1360
01:04:36,266 --> 01:04:37,324
We suck!

1361
01:04:40,371 --> 01:04:41,804
Our first big show.

1362
01:04:41,872 --> 01:04:43,806
We almost didn't make it.

1363
01:04:43,874 --> 01:04:46,001
I really hope
Cassandra's watching.

1364
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,310
Oh, yeah, perfect.
Whatever it costs...

1365
01:04:52,383 --> 01:04:54,010
- How's it going?
- Hi, guys.

1366
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:55,483
Well, tonight's the night.

1367
01:04:55,552 --> 01:04:57,850
A lot of people
in the Chicagoland area

1368
01:04:57,921 --> 01:04:59,718
will be watching the show.

1369
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:02,486
I already know
it's going to be a hit.

1370
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,959
I'll be in the booth.

1371
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:07,429
Mr. Vanderhoff
will be your first guest.

1372
01:05:07,498 --> 01:05:09,056
Oh, hi, boys.

1373
01:05:09,133 --> 01:05:10,998
What the hell is this?

1374
01:05:11,068 --> 01:05:13,628
Can we fly in
the sign, please?

1375
01:05:13,704 --> 01:05:15,365
That's it.
Bring her down.

1376
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:17,134
- Wha...
- Oh... look.

1377
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:18,765
Don't tense up.
You'll be great.

1378
01:05:18,842 --> 01:05:21,037
Garth, have you
got a second?

1379
01:05:21,111 --> 01:05:22,078
Uh... Wh...

1380
01:05:22,146 --> 01:05:23,579
Simply read the cards.

1381
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,877
You're going to be
wonderful. Really.

1382
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:26,881
O.K.?

1383
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:29,980
Oh, Russell...

1384
01:05:30,054 --> 01:05:31,988
can I borrow
your marker?

1385
01:05:32,056 --> 01:05:34,991
I, uh... I need
to make some notes.

1386
01:05:36,393 --> 01:05:37,451
Good luck.

1387
01:05:38,562 --> 01:05:39,995
My guys.

1388
01:05:40,064 --> 01:05:41,725
You're my guys!

1389
01:05:47,037 --> 01:05:49,835
Your name
is pronounced Algar, right?

1390
01:05:49,907 --> 01:05:51,499
O.K.

1391
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:53,236
Wayne!

1392
01:05:54,244 --> 01:05:55,609
They'll be fine.

1393
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:56,646
Good.

1394
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:58,441
- Stand by...
- This is it, honey.

1395
01:05:58,515 --> 01:06:00,107
In 5...

1396
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:01,116
4...

1397
01:06:01,185 --> 01:06:02,243
3...

1398
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:08,956
Wayne's World is brought to you
by Noah's Arcade.

1399
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:10,220
Party on, Wayne.

1400
01:06:10,294 --> 01:06:12,353
Hey!

1401
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:13,862
Wayne's World

1402
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:15,159
Wayne's World

1403
01:06:15,232 --> 01:06:17,792
Party time

1404
01:06:17,868 --> 01:06:19,358
Excellent

1405
01:06:19,436 --> 01:06:22,872
It's Friday. It's 11:30.
It's time to party

1406
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,374
with your excellent host
Wayne Campbell,

1407
01:06:25,442 --> 01:06:28,434
and with him, as always,
is Garth.

1408
01:06:28,512 --> 01:06:31,447
Party on, Wayne,
and party on, Garth.

1409
01:06:31,515 --> 01:06:33,983
Wayne's World

1410
01:06:35,185 --> 01:06:37,119
O.K. Welcome
to Wayne's World.

1411
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:38,779
Party on, Garth.

1412
01:06:38,856 --> 01:06:40,221
I guess.

1413
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:42,121
O.K. O.K.,
first of all,

1414
01:06:42,192 --> 01:06:44,956
we'd like to take a moment here
on Wayne's World

1415
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:46,620
to welcome our sponsor.

1416
01:06:46,697 --> 01:06:50,394
He's the owner of a fine chain
of Noah's Arcades...

1417
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:53,061
Noah Vanderhoff.
Nice name...

1418
01:06:53,137 --> 01:06:54,069
not.

1419
01:06:55,205 --> 01:06:57,799
Now, uh,
Mr. Vanderhoff...

1420
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,467
He's using
the cards. Yes!

1421
01:06:59,543 --> 01:07:01,943
I told you
he'd fall in line.

1422
01:07:02,012 --> 01:07:05,448
What is your most
popular video game right now?

1423
01:07:05,516 --> 01:07:07,848
Uh, Desert Storm
Commando Warrior.

1424
01:07:07,918 --> 01:07:09,943
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

1425
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:13,012
That would have to do with that
limited skirmish in the Middle East.

1426
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:14,182
Yes.

1427
01:07:14,258 --> 01:07:15,987
What the hell's he doing?

1428
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:19,256
Aren't there long lines
for your more popular games?

1429
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:22,526
Well, at Noah's Arcade,
we like to say

1430
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:25,500
there's two of everything,
so there's never a line.

1431
01:07:25,569 --> 01:07:26,763
Ha ha.

1432
01:07:26,837 --> 01:07:29,601
O.K. Now, tell me, Noah,
I've always wanted to know...

1433
01:07:29,673 --> 01:07:31,607
What is the difference
between Pac-Man

1434
01:07:31,675 --> 01:07:33,506
and Ms.Pac-Man, really?

1435
01:07:33,577 --> 01:07:36,774
Well, she has a bow on her head.

1436
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:37,779
That's it?

1437
01:07:37,848 --> 01:07:40,339
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1438
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:42,351
Get right
out of town.

1439
01:07:42,419 --> 01:07:43,351
No, that's it.

1440
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,352
Heh heh.

1441
01:07:44,421 --> 01:07:48,255
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

1442
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:49,383
Ha ha ha!

1443
01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:53,894
Thank you for being
on Wayne's World.

1444
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:56,262
It was informative
and stimulating.

1445
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,563
Now a word from our sponsor.

1446
01:07:58,635 --> 01:08:00,728
We're at commercial.

1447
01:08:00,804 --> 01:08:02,237
Oh, that was fun.

1448
01:08:02,306 --> 01:08:04,137
I'll see you next week.

1449
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:05,266
I hope.

1450
01:08:05,342 --> 01:08:07,902
Wayne, could you
come to the booth, please?

1451
01:08:07,978 --> 01:08:11,038
Oh, honey,
you were incredible.

1452
01:08:11,114 --> 01:08:13,548
I think it went
really well.

1453
01:08:13,617 --> 01:08:17,519
Absolutely. There was a huge
response up in that little room.

1454
01:08:17,588 --> 01:08:21,251
Those phrases were not on the cards
when I gave them to him.

1455
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:24,993
Wayne. What the hell
is going on?

1456
01:08:25,062 --> 01:08:26,495
What are you doing?

1457
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:28,531
Same thing we always do.

1458
01:08:28,599 --> 01:08:31,067
You've publicly
humiliated the sponsor.

1459
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:32,101
Yeah.

1460
01:08:32,169 --> 01:08:33,101
You're fired.

1461
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:34,831
Fired? For that?

1462
01:08:34,905 --> 01:08:37,100
Yeah. Right.
I'm out of here,

1463
01:08:37,174 --> 01:08:40,041
and I'm taking
my show with me.

1464
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,372
We own the show.

1465
01:08:41,445 --> 01:08:43,003
Aw, bite me.

1466
01:08:46,016 --> 01:08:47,415
O.K.

1467
01:08:47,484 --> 01:08:48,917
Are we back?

1468
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,252
Stand by.

1469
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:52,549
Coming back?

1470
01:08:52,623 --> 01:08:53,555
And go.

1471
01:08:53,624 --> 01:08:54,648
5...

1472
01:08:54,725 --> 01:08:55,657
4...

1473
01:08:55,726 --> 01:08:56,658
3...

1474
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:06,635
I'm having
a good time...

1475
01:09:07,704 --> 01:09:08,636
not.

1476
01:09:11,008 --> 01:09:14,239
Ever see that scene in Scanners
when that dude's head blew up?

1477
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:15,243
Uh...

1478
01:09:15,312 --> 01:09:16,244
Uh...

1479
01:09:16,313 --> 01:09:17,245
Uh...

1480
01:09:23,353 --> 01:09:24,285
Hello.

1481
01:09:24,354 --> 01:09:25,286
Hello.

1482
01:09:25,355 --> 01:09:26,617
It's Benjamin.

1483
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:27,884
Oh, hi.

1484
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,324
Uh, listen,
did you see the show tonight?

1485
01:09:30,394 --> 01:09:32,988
I was working,
so I only saw the first part,

1486
01:09:33,063 --> 01:09:35,088
but I laughed my ass off.

1487
01:09:35,165 --> 01:09:36,928
We had some
technical difficulties,

1488
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,434
and we're still playing
with the format, but...

1489
01:09:39,503 --> 01:09:41,130
has Wayne talked to you?

1490
01:09:43,006 --> 01:09:43,938
About what?

1491
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:46,237
Why? Are you
canceling my video?

1492
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,676
No. In fact, I called
to make sure we're still on.

1493
01:09:48,745 --> 01:09:51,179
Well, we got
a deal, right?

1494
01:09:51,248 --> 01:09:52,180
Absolutely.

1495
01:09:52,249 --> 01:09:54,240
I'll see you in Chicago.

1496
01:09:54,318 --> 01:09:55,250
O.K.

1497
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:56,308
Bye.

1498
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,487
You really
pissed me off tonight.

1499
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,961
Garth, you've never been mad
at anything in your life.

1500
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,464
But you shouldn't
have walked out on the show.

1501
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:10,966
I handled it O.K.,

1502
01:10:11,034 --> 01:10:13,468
but you shouldn't
walk out on your friend

1503
01:10:13,537 --> 01:10:15,232
without telling him first.

1504
01:10:15,305 --> 01:10:17,967
I have to run everything
by you now?

1505
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,475
Yeah, you have to
run everything by me now.

1506
01:10:20,544 --> 01:10:22,478
What am I,
some sort of chimp

1507
01:10:22,546 --> 01:10:24,411
with you as always
is Garth?

1508
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:26,176
Jim to your
Marlin Perkins?

1509
01:10:26,249 --> 01:10:28,979
You know, Benjamin
had you so snowed.

1510
01:10:29,052 --> 01:10:31,316
You know what?
He's got it for Cassandra.

1511
01:10:31,388 --> 01:10:32,446
No way.

1512
01:10:32,522 --> 01:10:33,989
Way.

1513
01:10:34,057 --> 01:10:35,820
Yeah! Cassandra's
not interested.

1514
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:36,881
As if.

1515
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,427
O.K., pop quiz...

1516
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:40,929
Cassandra is not interested
in Benjamin because:

1517
01:10:40,997 --> 01:10:44,091
A) chicks think
he's handsome;

1518
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:46,260
B) has cool car;,

1519
01:10:46,336 --> 01:10:48,770
C) has lots of cash;

1520
01:10:48,839 --> 01:10:50,670
D ) has no visible scars;

1521
01:10:50,741 --> 01:10:53,642
E) does not live with parents.

1522
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:56,440
O.K., how about...
F) you're a gimp.

1523
01:10:56,513 --> 01:10:58,879
You know what you can do
with your pop quiz?

1524
01:10:58,949 --> 01:11:01,440
You know what you can do
with your show?

1525
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:03,452
You can take a flying...

1526
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:14,463
Until the handle
breaks off

1527
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,465
and you have
to find a doctor

1528
01:11:16,533 --> 01:11:17,795
to pull it out again.

1529
01:11:17,868 --> 01:11:19,961
Kiss your mother
with that mouth?

1530
01:11:20,036 --> 01:11:21,469
You've gone mental.

1531
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:23,267
I'm getting out
of here, Damien.

1532
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,137
- Fine, then. Go.
- I'm gone.

1533
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:26,140
Go, then.

1534
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:27,767
- I am.
- Go.

1535
01:11:27,844 --> 01:11:29,573
- I'm gone.
- Go, then.

1536
01:11:29,646 --> 01:11:31,136
I am.

1537
01:11:41,812 --> 01:11:43,245
Where you been?

1538
01:11:43,313 --> 01:11:46,578
I waited up for you last night,

1539
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,117
and you never showed.

1540
01:11:48,185 --> 01:11:50,210
Where are you going?

1541
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:52,414
Chicago. Benjamin set up
the video shoot.

1542
01:11:52,489 --> 01:11:54,457
I'll be there
for three days.

1543
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:57,220
I guess Benjamin
will be there, too.

1544
01:11:57,294 --> 01:11:58,591
He's producing it.

1545
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,425
And what does that mean?

1546
01:12:00,497 --> 01:12:03,933
He's been paying you
a lot of attention lately.

1547
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,594
Well, maybe he thinks
I've got some talent.

1548
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,160
Maybe he's pokin' ya.

1549
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:11,106
What?

1550
01:12:11,174 --> 01:12:13,768
You think that's
the way I get a gig?

1551
01:12:13,844 --> 01:12:16,278
First he screws me,
then he screws you.

1552
01:12:16,346 --> 01:12:17,973
It's Dutch door action.

1553
01:12:19,349 --> 01:12:21,977
Could you be
any more insulting?

1554
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:24,077
Yeah.

1555
01:12:26,022 --> 01:12:28,456
I think
you better leave.

1556
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,954
Fine. I'm out of here.

1557
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:41,061
Oh, man.

1558
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:45,407
What the hell's going on?

1559
01:12:45,475 --> 01:12:48,911
I lost my show,
I lost my best friend,

1560
01:12:48,979 --> 01:12:50,412
I lost my girl.

1561
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,914
I'm being shit on,
that's all... shit on.

1562
01:12:52,983 --> 01:12:55,918
And do you know
what really pisses me off?

1563
01:12:55,986 --> 01:12:57,419
Where are you going?

1564
01:12:57,487 --> 01:12:59,421
O.K., O.K.,
come on back.

1565
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:02,424
Things aren't as bad
as they seem.

1566
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:05,427
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to dump on you.

1567
01:13:05,495 --> 01:13:07,429
I'll figure something out.

1568
01:13:07,497 --> 01:13:08,429
O.K.?

1569
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:16,939
Hey, Mr. Doughnuthead man,
who's trying to kill you?

1570
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:20,443
I don't know,
but they better not.

1571
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:22,944
If you stab a man
in the dead of winter,

1572
01:13:23,013 --> 01:13:26,278
steam will rise up
from the wounds.

1573
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:28,613
That's not good!
I'm not happy!

1574
01:13:28,685 --> 01:13:30,448
Oh, no!

1575
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,578
Indians believed

1576
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:34,021
it was his soul
escaping from his body.

1577
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:35,819
Right, Glen.

1578
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:37,757
Reee! Reee! Reee! Reee!

1579
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:39,954
Reee! Reee! Reee! Reee!

1580
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:41,554
Reee! Reee! Reee!

1581
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,462
Reee! Reee! Reee!

1582
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:45,433
Hi.

1583
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:52,065
Hi.

1584
01:13:52,142 --> 01:13:55,976
I'm sorry
about what I did...

1585
01:13:56,046 --> 01:13:57,536
Buds?

1586
01:13:59,049 --> 01:14:00,414
Buds.

1587
01:14:05,355 --> 01:14:07,220
Officer Kuharski.

1588
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,485
Damn shame
how they screwed up your show.

1589
01:14:09,559 --> 01:14:11,993
It was a nice little program.

1590
01:14:12,062 --> 01:14:14,656
Not that I ever watched it.

1591
01:14:14,731 --> 01:14:16,494
Here you go.

1592
01:14:16,566 --> 01:14:18,500
So, uh,
how you doing?

1593
01:14:18,568 --> 01:14:20,001
'K., s'pose.

1594
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,334
Just wish
I had Cassandra back.

1595
01:14:22,405 --> 01:14:26,000
She's in Chicago shooting a video
with "Bun-ja-mun."

1596
01:14:26,076 --> 01:14:27,008
So, uh...

1597
01:14:28,078 --> 01:14:30,012
What are you
going to do?

1598
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,513
I don't know.

1599
01:14:31,581 --> 01:14:33,344
I do have one plan.

1600
01:14:36,086 --> 01:14:39,249
What are you going to do
with these guys?

1601
01:14:39,322 --> 01:14:40,789
Oh, nothing, really.

1602
01:14:43,493 --> 01:14:46,462
I just always wanted
to open a door to a room

1603
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:48,463
where people
are being trained

1604
01:14:48,531 --> 01:14:50,465
like in James Bond movies.

1605
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:51,830
Wicked.

1606
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,975
I think you should
just go get Cassandra.

1607
01:15:00,043 --> 01:15:02,807
I just don't think
she wants me to.

1608
01:15:02,879 --> 01:15:05,143
Let me tell you
a little something

1609
01:15:05,215 --> 01:15:06,682
I've learned about women.

1610
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,777
They want you
to come get them.

1611
01:15:14,024 --> 01:15:17,516
They love it.

1612
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:20,495
I just wish there was
something I could offer her

1613
01:15:20,563 --> 01:15:22,053
that Benjamin couldn't.

1614
01:15:22,132 --> 01:15:23,929
You'll think of something.

1615
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:26,733
Wait a minute.

1616
01:15:26,803 --> 01:15:28,327
No.

1617
01:15:28,405 --> 01:15:29,838
Wait a minute.

1618
01:15:29,906 --> 01:15:30,930
Hmm.

1619
01:15:31,007 --> 01:15:32,338
Wait a minute!

1620
01:15:32,409 --> 01:15:33,501
I know...

1621
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:35,407
The guy in the limo,
Mr. Big,

1622
01:15:35,478 --> 01:15:37,275
the owner of Sharp records.

1623
01:15:37,347 --> 01:15:40,942
If we could just get him
to listen to Cassandra play.

1624
01:15:41,017 --> 01:15:42,450
Halt. Halt.

1625
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:44,783
The security guard
at the concert said

1626
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:47,948
Mr. Sharp was driving
back through Chicago on Friday.

1627
01:15:48,024 --> 01:15:49,457
That's right. Wow.

1628
01:15:49,526 --> 01:15:51,460
Aren't we lucky
we were there

1629
01:15:51,528 --> 01:15:53,462
to get all
that information?

1630
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,657
It seemed extraneous
at the time.

1631
01:15:55,732 --> 01:15:59,293
O.K., first I'll access
the secret military spy satellite

1632
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:02,304
that's in a geosynchronous orbit
over the Midwest.

1633
01:16:02,372 --> 01:16:05,432
Then I'll I.D. the limo
by the vanity plate "Mr. Biggg"

1634
01:16:05,508 --> 01:16:07,840
and get its position.

1635
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:11,472
Then I'll reposition the
transmitter dish in the remote truck

1636
01:16:11,548 --> 01:16:13,482
to 17.32 degrees east,

1637
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:15,142
hit Westar 4
over the Atlantic,

1638
01:16:15,218 --> 01:16:16,981
bounce the signal
down into the Azores,

1639
01:16:17,053 --> 01:16:18,486
up to Comsat 6,

1640
01:16:18,555 --> 01:16:21,149
beam it back
to Satcom 3 transponder 137,

1641
01:16:21,224 --> 01:16:24,660
and down to the dish
on Mr. Big's limo.

1642
01:16:24,728 --> 01:16:26,889
It's almost too easy.

1643
01:16:28,565 --> 01:16:29,998
We can only pray

1644
01:16:30,066 --> 01:16:32,000
he's watching television
in his limo

1645
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:33,501
at that exact moment.

1646
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,003
We'll need help.

1647
01:16:35,071 --> 01:16:36,504
- We'll help.
- We'll help.

1648
01:16:36,573 --> 01:16:38,768
You get Cassandra!
We'll do the rest!

1649
01:16:38,842 --> 01:16:41,504
To the Mirthmobile!

1650
01:16:41,578 --> 01:16:42,510
Yeah!

1651
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:44,240
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1652
01:16:50,353 --> 01:16:52,844
O.K., this is a take,
everybody.

1653
01:16:52,922 --> 01:16:54,856
I think the snake
fell asleep!

1654
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:55,856
Uh...

1655
01:16:59,629 --> 01:17:01,028
Playback!

1656
01:17:07,504 --> 01:17:09,665
Looking good.

1657
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:18,445
Ain't got no reason
for reaction

1658
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:19,948
No

1659
01:17:20,016 --> 01:17:26,046
Ain't got no reason
for distraction

1660
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:33,062
I love the way
that you love me, baby

1661
01:17:33,129 --> 01:17:36,098
Love the way
that you stare

1662
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:40,500
Ooh, the way
that you tease me, baby

1663
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:42,003
Ooh, touch me

1664
01:17:42,071 --> 01:17:43,834
Yeah

1665
01:17:43,907 --> 01:17:46,000
Touch me

1666
01:17:46,075 --> 01:17:47,542
This snake
weighs a ton.

1667
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:50,010
It looks great on you.

1668
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:51,512
I'm coming down now.

1669
01:17:51,581 --> 01:17:53,947
I'm telling you,
you're hot.

1670
01:18:29,853 --> 01:18:32,253
Yes, Officer?
Is there something wrong?

1671
01:18:32,322 --> 01:18:34,552
Have you seen this boy?

1672
01:18:34,624 --> 01:18:36,888
Aah!

1673
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,986
Aah!

1674
01:18:45,668 --> 01:18:47,659
You know,
you're exactly right.

1675
01:18:47,737 --> 01:18:48,999
Why leave the hotel?

1676
01:18:49,072 --> 01:18:51,006
We'll have dinner sent up,

1677
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:53,008
you can have
a hot bath,

1678
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:54,509
and I'll make
some calls.

1679
01:18:54,577 --> 01:18:55,566
Cassandra!

1680
01:18:56,246 --> 01:18:57,235
We have to talk.

1681
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,433
I don't want
to talk to you.

1682
01:18:58,468 --> 01:18:59,957
I don't want
to talk to you.

1683
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,963
I've set up an audition
for your band.

1684
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:05,302
My show's coming back.
You've got to be on it.

1685
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:06,466
Go home.

1686
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:07,975
I'm not going anywhere.

1687
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,341
Cassandra, I love you.

1688
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,142
You may not believe it,
but I love you.

1689
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:17,379
Am I supposed to just
turn my back and leave?

1690
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,977
Am I supposed
to be a man?

1691
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,989
Am I supposed to say,

1692
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,991
"That's O.K.
I don't mind."

1693
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:26,827
I don't mind.

1694
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:28,157
Well, I mind!

1695
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,993
I mind big time!

1696
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:34,001
And you know what
the worst part of all is?

1697
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,936
I never learned to read.

1698
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:40,998
Is that true?

1699
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:44,045
Yes. Everything except
the reading part.

1700
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:47,444
Very nice speech, Wayne.

1701
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:48,949
We're very busy.

1702
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,951
Of course.
Her music video.

1703
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:52,111
Very clever.

1704
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,121
But where is her band?

1705
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,622
- Hi, Wayne.
- Hi, Wayne.

1706
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:59,422
Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't see you there.

1707
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:02,463
Well, I guess you've thought
of everything, huh?

1708
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:06,467
Nothing left for me to do
but just go home.

1709
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:09,060
Bye-bye, Wayne.
It's bedtime.

1710
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,537
But both you and I know

1711
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:14,542
that there is no film
in this camera.

1712
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:20,013
Jimmy!

1713
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,050
Wayne...

1714
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,952
go home.

1715
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:38,999
Sometimes people
outgrow one another.

1716
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,500
It's very sad,

1717
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:43,003
but you can't
let it drag you down.

1718
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:46,006
Is that you...
or the snake?

1719
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,009
Campbell, wait up!

1720
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,014
Cassandra, I know
I don't have his looks,

1721
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:56,516
I know I don't
have his money,

1722
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:58,519
I know I don't
have his connections,

1723
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,020
his knowledge
of fine wines,

1724
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:02,022
I know sometimes
when I eat

1725
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,024
I get this clicking sound
in my jaw...

1726
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:06,526
Shut your yap
and get in the car.

1727
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:07,527
Excellent.

1728
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,540
That's right, girl.

1729
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:24,807
Mr. Big's limousine
is right where we want it.

1730
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:33,717
Gentlemen, this is it.

1731
01:21:33,789 --> 01:21:35,051
Let's go.

1732
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,055
Down now!

1733
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:48,002
Wait up, guys.
I fell on my keys.

1734
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,474
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1735
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:09,856
Freeze!

1736
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,358
Oh, hi, Russell.

1737
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,688
How's it going?

1738
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,524
Hold it right there.
Hey! Hey!

1739
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,531
Watch where
you're pointing that thing.

1740
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,533
Give me the flashlight,
Russell.

1741
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,069
You can help us,
Russell.

1742
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,537
No! I'm supposed
to stop you.

1743
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,699
W-w-what are you
going to do,

1744
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,208
be Benjamin's monkey boy

1745
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,868
the rest of your life?

1746
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,310
Benjamin's my friend.

1747
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,540
No.

1748
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:36,482
Benjamin is
no one's friend.

1749
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:40,043
If Benjamin were
an ice cream flavor,

1750
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:43,182
he'd be
pralines and dick.

1751
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:46,319
It's O.K.

1752
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,490
He's going to be...

1753
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:52,624
O.K.

1754
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,367
Hi.

1755
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,201
- Hi.
- How's it going?

1756
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:09,516
I love you, man.

1757
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:10,516
I know.

1758
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:15,022
No, you don't.

1759
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:18,924
I... love you, man.

1760
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,518
I know.

1761
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:22,358
Just say thank you.

1762
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:24,799
Hey!

1763
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,529
Thank you.

1764
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:31,663
All right.

1765
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,708
I understand
you're doing your job,

1766
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,640
but I'm very late.

1767
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,476
Would you mind placing
your hands on the hood, son?

1768
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:42,984
There's just one other thing
I've got to check.

1769
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:53,984
Wayne's World,
Wayne's World

1770
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:54,994
Party time

1771
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:55,995
Excellent

1772
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:02,267
O.K, this is a special
Wayne's World, O.K.?

1773
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:04,498
It's for
an audience of one.

1774
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:07,201
So, Mr. Frankie Sharp
of Sharp Records,

1775
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:09,835
if you're watching
and you like what you see,

1776
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:13,472
we're at 2234 Pine Way
in Aurora, Illinois.

1777
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,015
So, ladies and gentlemen,

1778
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:18,814
I give you Cassandra
and Crucial Taunt!

1779
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,514
Yeah! Whoo!

1780
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:27,357
Well, it's been gettin'
so hard

1781
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:31,024
Livin' with the things
you do to me

1782
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,202
My dreams are gettin'
so strange

1783
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:40,469
I'd like to tell you
everythin' I see

1784
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:43,636
I see a man at the back,

1785
01:24:43,712 --> 01:24:44,804
as a matter of fact,

1786
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,007
his eyes are as red
as the sun,

1787
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,642
and a girl in the corner
let no one ignore her,

1788
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:51,743
'cause she thinks
she's the passionate one.

1789
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:53,651
Oh, yeah!

1790
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:55,189
It was like lightning

1791
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,657
Everybody was
frightening

1792
01:24:57,726 --> 01:24:59,751
And the music
was soothing

1793
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:01,989
And we all started
grooving

1794
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:02,995
Yeah

1795
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:05,157
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1796
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:06,996
And the man at the back said,
everyone attack

1797
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:09,332
And it turned into
a ballroom blitz

1798
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:11,497
And the girl in the corner said,
boy, I wanna warn ya

1799
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,336
It'll turn into
a ballroom blitz

1800
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:14,466
Ballroom blitz

1801
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:19,836
Ballroom blitz

1802
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:25,012
I'm reachin' out
for somethin'

1803
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:27,554
Touchin' nothin's
all I ever do

1804
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,994
I softly call you over

1805
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:34,994
When you appear

1806
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,588
There's nothin' left
of you

1807
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:42,436
Now the man at the back
is ready to crack

1808
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,870
as he raises his hands
to the sky,

1809
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:47,170
and the girl in the corner
is everyone's mourner.

1810
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,437
She could kill you
with a wink of her eye.

1811
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:50,773
Oh, yeah

1812
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,006
It was electric

1813
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:55,276
So frightfully hectic

1814
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,614
And the band
started leaping

1815
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:59,779
'Cause they all
stopped breathing

1816
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:00,946
Yeah

1817
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:02,956
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1818
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:04,889
And the man at the back said,
everyone attack

1819
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,951
And it turned
into a ballroom blitz

1820
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:09,360
And the girl in the corner said,
boy, I wanna warn ya

1821
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:11,194
It'll turn into
a ballroom blitz

1822
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,290
Ballroom blitz

1823
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:16,796
Ballroom blitz

1824
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:33,145
Waaa...

1825
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:34,483
Ow!

1826
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,493
Waaaow!

1827
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:48,501
Whoo!

1828
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,662
Yeah!

1829
01:26:49,738 --> 01:26:52,002
Ha ha ha ow!

1830
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:54,507
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp,
Sharp Records.

1831
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,271
I saw your performance
in my limo.

1832
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:58,938
I've seen a lot
of acts in my day,

1833
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:02,006
and although
you're extremely beautiful,

1834
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:05,610
I just think
it's the wrong time.

1835
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:06,847
I'm sorry.

1836
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:09,321
You screwed my career.

1837
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:13,155
I always knew
you were small-time.

1838
01:27:14,872 --> 01:27:16,567
Wayne, I'm pregnant.

1839
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,006
That's why I've been so moody.

1840
01:27:21,378 --> 01:27:23,312
Whoa!

1841
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:24,642
Look! Fire!

1842
01:27:24,715 --> 01:27:26,307
Let's get out of here!

1843
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:28,112
Whoa!

1844
01:27:28,252 --> 01:27:29,480
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1845
01:27:41,999 --> 01:27:43,432
Why, God?

1846
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:46,933
Why?

1847
01:27:52,843 --> 01:27:56,108
Last night was the most
incredible night

1848
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:58,444
of my life.

1849
01:27:58,516 --> 01:28:00,450
You were terrific.

1850
01:28:09,026 --> 01:28:10,459
You didn't really think

1851
01:28:10,528 --> 01:28:13,793
she'd end up with Wayne, did you?

1852
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:16,291
As if.

1853
01:28:16,367 --> 01:28:18,961
As if we'd end the movie
like that. Yeah!

1854
01:28:19,036 --> 01:28:20,628
Let's do
the Scooby-Doo ending.

1855
01:28:20,704 --> 01:28:21,796
Good call.

1856
01:28:21,872 --> 01:28:24,466
Doodle-oo! Doodle-oo!
Doodle-oo! Doodle-oo!

1857
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:25,975
Doodle-oo! Doodle-oo!
Doodle-oo!

1858
01:28:37,988 --> 01:28:39,455
Waaaow!

1859
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:41,423
Hi. Frankie Sharp,
Sharp Records.

1860
01:28:41,492 --> 01:28:44,928
I just saw your performance
in my limo.

1861
01:28:44,995 --> 01:28:46,257
Wow! We got through.

1862
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:48,093
Well, that wraps it up,

1863
01:28:48,165 --> 01:28:49,928
but there's
one last thing.

1864
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,527
Let's just see who
you really are, mister.

1865
01:28:53,604 --> 01:28:56,937
It's Old Man Withers, the guy who
runs the haunted amusement park!

1866
01:28:57,007 --> 01:28:58,941
I would have
got away with it

1867
01:28:59,009 --> 01:29:00,977
if it hadn't been
for you snooping kids!

1868
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:03,445
Good one, Shaggy.

1869
01:29:03,514 --> 01:29:04,947
Excellent
Scooby-Doo ending.

1870
01:29:05,015 --> 01:29:06,949
I think we should do
the megahappy ending.

1871
01:29:07,017 --> 01:29:08,780
The megahappy ending.
That's doable.

1872
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,954
Doodle-oo!
Doodle-oo! Doodle-oo!

1873
01:29:12,022 --> 01:29:13,853
Doodle-oo! Doodle-oo!
Doodle-oo! Doodle-oo!

1874
01:29:26,036 --> 01:29:27,833
Waaaow!

1875
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:29,964
I'm Frankie Sharp,
Sharp Records.

1876
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,975
I saw your performance
in my limo.

1877
01:29:33,043 --> 01:29:35,637
I must tell you,
it was terrific.

1878
01:29:35,713 --> 01:29:38,409
In fact, I think
it's so good,

1879
01:29:38,482 --> 01:29:41,417
I'm going to give you
a six-album deal.

1880
01:29:41,485 --> 01:29:42,782
See you in my office.

1881
01:29:43,988 --> 01:29:45,421
I love you, Wayne.

1882
01:29:45,489 --> 01:29:47,081
I love you, Cassandra.

1883
01:29:50,995 --> 01:29:52,428
I love you, Garth.

1884
01:29:52,496 --> 01:29:54,430
I love you, dreamwoman.

1885
01:29:54,498 --> 01:29:56,932
You know, ever since
I did your show,

1886
01:29:57,001 --> 01:30:00,152
kids are looking at me
in a whole new way.

1887
01:30:00,286 --> 01:30:01,878
I love you, man.

1888
01:30:01,954 --> 01:30:03,512
And I love you,

1889
01:30:03,589 --> 01:30:05,056
because I've learned

1890
01:30:05,124 --> 01:30:08,890
that Platonic love
can exist between two grown men.

1891
01:30:08,961 --> 01:30:10,724
And I've learned
something, too.

1892
01:30:10,796 --> 01:30:13,230
I've learned
that a flawless profile,

1893
01:30:13,299 --> 01:30:14,732
a perfect body,

1894
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,234
the right clothes,
and a great car

1895
01:30:17,303 --> 01:30:20,238
can get you far in America...
almost to the top...

1896
01:30:20,306 --> 01:30:22,740
but it can't get you everything.

1897
01:30:23,976 --> 01:30:26,911
Isn't it great
that we're all better people?

1898
01:30:28,314 --> 01:30:29,406
- Fishnet!
- Fishnet!

1899
01:30:29,482 --> 01:30:31,416
Fishnet!

1900
01:30:34,487 --> 01:30:35,545
Fishnet!

1901
01:30:35,688 --> 01:30:37,849
Wayne's World

1902
01:30:37,924 --> 01:30:39,858
It's party time

1903
01:30:39,926 --> 01:30:41,689
It's excellent

1904
01:30:41,761 --> 01:30:44,355
Chicks go mental
when we go down the street

1905
01:30:47,867 --> 01:30:50,358
It's Wayne and Garth
that they wanna meet

1906
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:56,708
We're in the basement
playin' with our toys

1907
01:30:59,211 --> 01:31:02,544
Oh, if you do not like it,
you're a sphincter boy

1908
01:31:04,617 --> 01:31:06,050
Wayne's World

1909
01:31:06,118 --> 01:31:07,642
Wayne's World

1910
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,381
It's party time

1911
01:31:09,455 --> 01:31:10,547
It's excellent

1912
01:31:10,623 --> 01:31:12,215
Wayne's World

1913
01:31:12,291 --> 01:31:13,485
Wayne's World

1914
01:31:13,559 --> 01:31:15,390
It's party time

1915
01:31:15,461 --> 01:31:16,894
It's excellent

1916
01:31:21,968 --> 01:31:23,902
Excellent movie.
All right.

1917
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,403
Yeah. Good one.

1918
01:31:25,471 --> 01:31:28,406
Well, that's all the time
we have for our movie.

1919
01:31:28,474 --> 01:31:31,307
We hope you found it
entertaining,

1920
01:31:31,377 --> 01:31:32,742
whimsical and yet relevant,

1921
01:31:32,812 --> 01:31:34,746
with an underlying
revisionist conceit

1922
01:31:34,814 --> 01:31:37,339
that belied the film's
emotional attachments

1923
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:39,850
to the subject matter.

1924
01:31:39,919 --> 01:31:42,353
I just hope
you didn't think it sucked.

1925
01:31:42,421 --> 01:31:44,855
O.K. So thank you
for coming.

1926
01:31:44,924 --> 01:31:46,186
Good night and party on.

1927
01:31:46,258 --> 01:31:47,190
Party on, Wayne.

1928
01:31:47,259 --> 01:31:48,351
Party on, Garth.

1929
01:31:48,427 --> 01:31:49,860
Wayne's World

1930
01:31:49,929 --> 01:31:51,191
Wayne's World

1931
01:31:51,263 --> 01:31:53,197
It's party time

1932
01:31:53,265 --> 01:31:54,357
It's excellent

1933
01:31:54,433 --> 01:31:55,866
Wayne's World

1934
01:31:55,935 --> 01:31:57,368
Wayne's World

1935
01:31:57,436 --> 01:31:59,199
It's party time

1936
01:31:59,271 --> 01:32:01,205
It's excellent

1937
01:32:01,273 --> 01:32:03,867
Chicks go mental
when we go down the street

1938
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,541
It's Wayne and Garth
that they wanna meet

1939
01:32:13,285 --> 01:32:16,379
We're in the basement
playin' with our toys

1940
01:32:18,624 --> 01:32:22,060
Oh, if you do not like it
you're a sphincter boy

1941
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:25,392
Wayne's World

1942
01:32:25,464 --> 01:32:26,897
Wayne's World

1943
01:32:26,966 --> 01:32:28,900
It's party time

1944
01:32:28,968 --> 01:32:30,060
It's excellent

1945
01:32:30,136 --> 01:32:31,569
Wayne's World

1946
01:32:31,637 --> 01:32:33,127
Wayne's World

1947
01:32:33,205 --> 01:32:34,900
It's party time

1948
01:32:34,974 --> 01:32:36,839
It's excellent

1949
01:32:36,909 --> 01:32:39,537
We might grow old,
we might get in a rut

1950
01:32:43,082 --> 01:32:46,017
Yeah, right, and monkeys
might fly out of our butts

1951
01:32:49,088 --> 01:32:51,852
The right to party is
a battle we have fought

1952
01:32:55,094 --> 01:32:58,530
So we'll surrender
and go Amish... not!

1953
01:32:59,765 --> 01:33:01,357
Wayne's World

1954
01:33:01,434 --> 01:33:02,867
Wayne's World

1955
01:33:02,935 --> 01:33:04,698
It's party time

1956
01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:05,862
It's excellent

1957
01:33:05,938 --> 01:33:07,371
Wayne's World

1958
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,873
Wayne's World

1959
01:33:08,941 --> 01:33:10,772
It's party time

1960
01:33:10,843 --> 01:33:12,208
It's excellent

1961
01:33:24,457 --> 01:33:27,392
Chicks go mental

1962
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:30,554
Chicks go mental

1963
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:33,393
Chicks go mental

1964
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:39,834
Chicks go mental

1965
01:33:39,905 --> 01:33:41,839
Chicks go mental

1966
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,854
You know,
I don't think

1967
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:59,857
anyone's going to
tell us when to leave.

1968
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:01,358
Yeah. Good call, Garth.

1969
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:04,362
I'll bet we're just
going to sit here,

1970
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,863
and when they're finished,

1971
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:07,364
they'll fade to black.

1972
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:13,701
I can't believe
they did that.

1973
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:15,685
I told ya.
