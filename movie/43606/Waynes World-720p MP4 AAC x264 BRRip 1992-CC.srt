You haven't been into Shakey's

<i>Wayne's World Totally Amazing</i>
<i>Excellent Discoveries.</i>

29
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,777
Our guest is Ron Paxton.

30
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,738
-Welcome to Wayne's World, Ron.
-Thanks, Wayne.

31
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,991
Now, you're the inventor
of the Suck Kut, right?

32
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,785
What exactly is a Suck Kut?

33
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,704
The Suck Kut is a revolution
in home haircutting.

34
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,291
Wow. What a totally amazing,
excellent discovery.

35
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,542
Well, yes.

36
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,087
Fireworks!

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,092
Now, Ron, the question
that's on everybody's mind is,

38
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,302
"How does it work?"

39
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,096
I'm fully prepared
to give a complete demonstration.

40
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,932
Okay, okay, Garth, just sit there,

41
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,100
and he's gonna put that thing
on your melon, okay?

42
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,103
Just a trim. Don't buzz me, all right?

43
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,360
So, tell me, Ron,

44
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,695
exactly how does the Suck Kut work?

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,407
Well, as you can see, it sucks as it cuts.

46
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,536
It certainly does suck.

47
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,499
-What are we looking at?
<i>-Wayne's World.</i>

48
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,417
These guys, they do their show
out of their basement.

49
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,550
-People watch this?
-Yeah, lots.

50
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,510
Turn it off, man! Turn it off!

51
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,595
It's sucking my will to live!

52
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,722
<i>Oh, the humanity!</i>

53
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,852
-Will you hand me the telephone?
-Sure.

54
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,603
<i>Can l have a buzz? No!</i>

55
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,188
<i>No, no.</i>

56
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,940
Russell, it's Benjamin.

57
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,525
Are you watching TV?

58
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,777
Listen, could you turn it to channel 1 0?

59
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,363
I want you to find out
who these guys are

60
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,448
and where they do their show.

61
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,868
I think we've found something
that we can sell to Vanderhoff.

62
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,911
-Take your Ritalin, okay?
-I don't have a buzz...

63
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,414
-Okay? You're in a forest.
-Forest?

64
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,374
You're in a forest with Heather Locklear.

65
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,334
-With Heather?
-And you're very warm.

66
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,419
-Yeah?
-Very...

67
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,628
-Warm?
-...warm.

68
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,630
These guys are so funny.

69
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,966
Oh, they're obviously brilliant.

70
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:47,101
Wow! What a totally amazing,
excellent discovery...not!

71
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,186
Thanks, Ron.

72
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,231
Okay, that's all the time
we have for this week.

73
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,441
Until then, good night!

74
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,401
-Party on, Wayne.
-Party on, Garth.

Excellent!

84
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,587
Let me bring you up to speed.

85
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,380
My name is Wayne Campbell.

86
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,175
I live in Aurora, Illinois,

87
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,052
which is a suburb of Chicago.

88
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,386
Excellent!

89
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,680
I've had plenty of Joe jobs,

90
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,642
nothing I'd call a career.

91
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,393
Let me put it this way,

92
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,189
I have an extensive collection
of name tags and hair nets.

93
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,028
Okay, I still live with my parents,

94
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,280
which I admit is both bogus and sad,

95
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,742
but at least I've got
an amazing cable access show,

96
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,911
and I still know how to party.

97
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,371
But what I'd really love

98
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,456
is to do Wayne's World for a living.

99
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,791
It might happen.

100
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,377
Yeah, and monkeys
might fly out of my butt.

101
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,463
Ah, the Mirthmobile.

102
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,763

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,352
Does anyone else smell bacon?

164
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,939
Yeah, I definitely smell
a pork product of some type.

165
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,442
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know what you're doing, Campbell.

166
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,778
Bacon, pig, oink-oink, police officer.

167
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,532
I used to say that to cops
when I was your age.

168
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,243
-Hey, what are you up to?
-Me?

169
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,330
I just pulled over a tour bus
on its way to Chicago.

170
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,875
We had a tip that there was
some drug smuggling going down.

171
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,418
We searched the entire vehicle.

172
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,880
It was clean, so we had to proceed
with the body cavity searches.

173
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,173
No way.

174
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,968
Way! I inspected 1 2 individuals myself,
inside and out.

175
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,101
Okay, this guy needs coffee
and crullers, stat!

176
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,562
We gotta get him to Rampart. Let's go!

177
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,609
This is Stan Mikita's donuts.

178
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,611
Excellent munchables.

179
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,989
This is the manager, Glen.

180
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,367
He's here 24 hours a day.

181
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,160
I recommend the Sugar Pucks.

182
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,537
They're excellent. Come on.

183
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,541
I'd never done a crazy thing in my life
before that night.

184
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,254
Why is it if a man kills
another man in battle, it's called heroic,

185
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,215
yet if he kills a man in the heat
of passion, it's called murder?

186
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,968
Hello! What do you think you're doing?

187
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,345
Only me and Garth
get to talk to the camera.

188
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,554
Come on.

189
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:03,143
I don't really
have too much to say right now.

190
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,603
What's that?

191
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,774
Hi, Mr. Withers.
How's the amusement park going?

192
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,359
Just great, Wayne.

193
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,322
Four coffees and
a half dozen crullers, please.

194
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,074
And one jelly donut.

195
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,621
Hey, there's your girlfriend,
Garth. Yeah.

196
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,639
Ow.

197
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,562
Excuse me, I fell.

198
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,524
Don't you guys ever get tired
of ordering the same thing?

199
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,942
-No.
-No.

200
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,862
Don't look. Stacy.

201
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,196
Where?

202
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,491
Oh, God. I made eye contact.

203
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,244
Psycho hose beast.

204
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,543
Happy anniversary, Wayne.

205
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,503
Stacy, we broke up two months ago.

206
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,297
Well, that doesn't mean
we can't still go out.

207
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,798
Well, it does, actually.

208
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,675
That's what breaking up is.

209
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,136
Well, are you gonna go
to the Gasworks tonight?

210
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,262
No.

211
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,764
-No!
-No!

212
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,849
Don't you wanna open your present?

213
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,685
If it's a severed head,
I'm gonna be very upset.

214
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,105
-Open it.
-Okay. Okay.

215
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,196
-What is it?
-It's a gun rack.

216
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,655
A gun rack?

217
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,199
A gun rack.

218
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,326
Yeah, great.

219
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,203
I don't even own a gun,

220
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,498
let alone many guns
that would necessitate an entire rack.

221
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,043
What am I gonna do with a gun rack?

222
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,254
You don't like it, fine.

223
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,134
You know, Wayne, if you're not careful,
you're gonna lose me.

224
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,178
I lost you two months ago.

225
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,722
Are you mental? We broke up!

226
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,516
Get the net!

227
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,576
-Wayne!
-Hey!

228
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,495
How you doing? Garth!

229
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,832
Hey, Tiny, who's playing tonight?

230
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,543
Jolly Green Giants, The Shitty Beatles.

231
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,878
The Shitty Beatles. Are they any good?

232
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,088
They suck.

233
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,382
Then it's not just a clever name?

234
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,508
Who else?

235
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,136
Crucial Taunt,
and they're just finishing the set.

236
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,595
I hear they can wail.

237
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,347
You're right. Party on.

238
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,682
-Party on.
-Yo!

239
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,016
All right, Wayne, Garth.

240
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,020
<i>All right!</i>

241
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,190
<i>Now, dig this, baby!</i>

242
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,942
<i>You don't care for me</i>

243
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,986
<i>l don't care about that</i>

244
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,446
This is the Gasworks,

245
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,573
an excellent heavy metal bar.

246
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,949
Always a babe fest.

247
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,784
And they got a pool table, too.

248
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,036
<i>Let me stand next to your fire</i>

249
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,164
Party!

250
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,001
Party! Excuse me.

251
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,628
<i>Let me stand next to your fire</i>

252
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,005
<i>Let me stand</i>

253
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,631
<i>Let me stand next to your fire</i>

254
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,508
Hey. Excuse me.

255
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,553
Excuse me.

256
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,055
-What?
-I'd like to get by now.

257
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,100
Get out of my face, you little dweeb.

258
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,228
Ow.

259
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,482
<i>l have only one itching desire</i>

260
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:42,070

00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,969

<i>Let me stand next to your fire</i>

00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,106
Excuse me.

267
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,442
<i>Hey, let me stand next to your fire</i>

268
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,361
What do you want, you little dweeb?

269
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,615
<i>Oh, let me stand next to your fire</i>

270
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,374
Thank you.

271
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,875
<i>You say your mama ain't home</i>

272
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,418
<i>lt ain't my concern</i>

273
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,630
<i>Just don't play with me</i>
<i>And you won't get burned</i>

274
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,888
She's a babe! Schwing!

275
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,024
Yeah

276
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,189
-Fight, fight, fight!
-Fight, fight, fight!

277
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,196
Yeah!

278
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,409
All right.

279
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,872
I love this woman.

280
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,793
Hey, Raymond,
club soda with a lime, please.

281
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,004
And would you get me a towel?

282
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,631
Wow, you really wail.

283
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,341
Thanks.

284
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,636
Hey, you're that "party time" guy on TV.
Wayne, right?

285
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,263
-Yes, and you are?
-Cassandra.

286
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,431
Cassandra.

287
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,559
Rough night, huh?
Everybody's kung fu fighting.

288
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,689
Yeah. Well, nice meeting you.

289
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,025
Hey, hold on! Can I call you sometime?

290
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,444
You got 5 bucks,
you can come to the rent party.

291
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,820
It's at my loft.

292
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,238
I'm there.

293
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,160
I gotta go, the club owner's
trying to dick me out of some money.

294
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,996
Okay, okay, okay.

295
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,457
See how many people I brought in here?

296
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,250
That bass player's a babe.

297
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,212
She makes me feel kind of funny,

298
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,423
like when we used to
climb the rope in gym class.

299
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,093
You said I'd get cash up front.

300
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,220
She will be mine.

301
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,640
Oh, yes. She will be mine.

302
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,197
Pardon me.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?

303
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,221
<i>Okay, Garth, just sit there, all right?</i>

304
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,098
<i>He's gonna put that thing</i>
<i>on your melon.</i>

305
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,935
<i>Oh, okay, but just a trim.</i>
<i>Don't buzz me, all right?</i>

306
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>-Oh, no!</i>
<i>-Help me, Ron.</i>

307
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,278
Russell, stop the tape.

308
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,489
So, what do you think?

309
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,993
I think it's two chimps
on a davenport in a basement.

310
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,995
I'm not sponsoring this.

311
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,998
I got spots on Love Boat, but this?
What is this?

312
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,917
Mr. Vanderhoff, this is your audience.
I mean, look at them.

313
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,462
They're the same kids that line up
at Noah's Arcade every weekend.

314
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,838
Well, it looks so cheesy.

315
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,256
That would be where I come in.

316
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,758
Russell's our best producer.

317
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,385
He does Chicago PM,
with Elaine Ronkey,

318
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,764
<i>Sunshine Saturday,</i>
<i>the African American Digest.</i>

319
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,766
-I never heard of that one.
-It's on very late.

320
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,267
It won several awards.

321
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,269
Yeah, well,
I think I'll stick with Love Boat.

322
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,356
If I may, speaking from
a producer/director standpoint,

323
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,901
kids can relate to this show.

324
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,069
These guys aren't phonies.

325
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,447
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

326
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,823
Kids know dick.

327
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,700
I watch them in my arcades.

328
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:42,829
They stand like laboratory rats hitting
the feeder bar to get a food pellet.

329
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:47,250
But as long as they keep pumping in
the quarters, who gives a shit, right?

330
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,710
Let me ask you something.

331
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,506
What is your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

332
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,718
Well, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

333
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,304
Like, we have a new game
called Zantar.

334
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,308
Zantar is a gelatinous cube
that eats warriors in a medieval village,

335
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,394
and every time it eats a chieftain,
you ascend to a higher level.

336
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,563
Beauty part is,
you can't get to the next level,

337
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,733
so the kids keep
coughing up quarters, you know.

338
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,319
Gelatinous cube eats village.

339
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,779
I think it's terrific.

340
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,364
You know, I know nothing
about video games.

341
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,157
I found what you just said riveting.

342
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,035
-Well, I do my own commercials.
-I did not know that.

343
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,371
Of course, I don't mention the games
in the commercials,

344
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,666
because the technology moves
so much faster than the advertising.

345
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,252
I did not realize that.
Russell, did you realize that?

346
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,462
No, I did not realize that.

347
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,216
So, Mr. Vanderhoff,
let me see if I'm hearing you correctly.

348
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,428
Are you saying that if you had a spot,
say on a weekly show,

349
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,431
that you could come on the show
and update the kids

350
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,309
on exactly what was new
in your arcade?

351
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,604
-Yeah, that's it.
-Well, I'm impressed.

352
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,147
Wow.

353
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,068
Noah's Arcade presents
<i>Wayne's World.</i>

354
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,820
I've gotta tell you, I think that's brilliant.

355
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,280
Brilliant.

356
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,906
Well, thank you.

357
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,408
We'll get right to work on this.

358
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,243
We'll send the contracts
over to your office.

359
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,078
We'll be in touch.

360
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,417
-I'd like to think about this.
-Oh, of course you would.

361
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,169
-I wouldn't have it any other way.
-Yeah.

362
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,591
-She'll validate you.
-Thank you.

363
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,803
He's in.

364
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,476
-You've gotta get on it, right away.
-This morning.

365
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,396
Stop it, you're scaring me.

366
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,191
Oh, cool.
You're learning Cassandra's language.

367
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,528
I've never seen you
so mental over a girl before.

368
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,489
-Are you gonna marry her?
-Garth,

369
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,743
marriage is punishment for shoplifting
in some countries.

370
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,037
Okay, passed inspection.

371
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,289
-All right.
-Just barely.

372
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,001
Okay, that's $42.57, Wayne,
parts and labor.

373
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,462
-No way.
-Brutal.

374
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,047
-Okay. There you go.
-We got it.

375
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,007
-All right, we got it, we got it.
-That's not enough.

376
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,009
-What?
-We got that.

377
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,928
-We got that.
-That's good, but I need more.

378
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,472
Oh, man, why...
Why don't you use a gun?

379
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,307
It's not my fault, come on.

380
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,351
I suppose it's society's fault?

381
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,518
More.

382
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,731
-Cool.
-All right.

383
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,359
Well, here's an extra dollar.

384
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,988
You guys should have been
at Gasworks on Friday.

385
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,114
Yeah, we were there.

386
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,450
There was this band, Crucial Taunt.

387
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,328
They had this mega babe
for a lead singer. Unreal!

388
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,913
Phil, we were there.

389
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,332
Have you gone mental? Hello.

390
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:35,293
-I think we should go now.
-Here you go.

391
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,544
-Cool.
-Cool.

392
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,938
You think it's wise
to sell a show we don't own?

393
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,066
By tonight, we will.

394
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,158
Excuse me.

395
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,161
Do you know where we could find
Wayne Campbell?

396
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:11,496
That would be privileged information.

397
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,498
We just wanna know
where they broadcast from.

398
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,709
Are you a friend or a relative?

399
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,127
We're neither.

400
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,340
You know, Russell,
I may not have grown up around here,

401
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,051
but I understand these people.

402
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,263
This must be the place.

403
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,560
Okay, we're just about
out of time, right?

404
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,812
But before we go,
we'd like to take a moment here

405
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,188
for a Wayne's World salute

406
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,691
to the Guess jeans girl,
Claudia Schiffer.

407
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,776
-Schwing!
-Schwing!

408
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,029
Tent pole! She's a babe.

409
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,072
She's magically babe-licious.

410
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,284
She tested very high
on the strokability scale.

411
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,621
-Okay.
-Hey, are you through yet?

412
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,457
'Cause I'm getting tired of holding this.

413
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,542
Yeah, that's what she said.

414
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,631
Okay, so, Claudia Schiffer,
we salute you.

415
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,633
-Scha-wing!
-Scha-wing!

416
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,719
Okay. That's all the time
we have for this week.

417
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:08,928
Until then, good night.

418
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,722
-Party on, Wayne.
-Party on, Garth.

419
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,016
<i>Wayne's World, Wayne's World</i>

420
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,268
<i>Party time, excellent</i>

421
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,191
And...we're clear.

422
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,109
-All right!
-Okay! Excellent show, everyone.

423
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,819
-All right. Excellent.
-All right.

424
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,446
Great show.

425
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,698
Wayne, Benjamin Kane,

426
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,867
Regional Program Director
for Oliver Communications.

427
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,951
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

428
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,913
And I'm Russell Finley.
We spoke earlier today. Hi.

429
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,791
Listen, maybe we can go somewhere
and get acquainted.

430
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,043
Russell, why don't you
get to know the crew?

431
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,711
-You know anywhere nice?
-Hi.

432
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,755
-See you guys later.
-Hi.

433
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,844
First of all,
let me get this out of the way.

434
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,055
-I'm a big fan.
-You are?

435
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,309
The way I see it,
your show is capable of so much more.

436
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,394
Well, we'll try harder, okay?

437
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,063
Just give us a second chance.

438
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,315
Just don't come in and cancel us
without giving us a second chance.

439
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,360
Garth, come on, relax, all right?
Your pills?

440
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,696
He can't cancel us.
We're on public access.

441
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,989
Can I be honest with you?

442
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,200
My job, it's usually such a bore,

443
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,161
but the other day,
the most incredible thing happened.

444
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,330
-What happened?
-Noah Vanderhoff,

445
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:21,167
the owner of the largest chain of video
arcades in Chicago, is in my office,

446
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,462
and he asks me,
"What's with this show, Wayne's World,

447
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,172
"that I keep hearing so much about?"

448
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,383
Well, I have all your shows on tape.

449
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,093
Like I said, I'm a fan.

450
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,678
I put a show in for him,

451
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,930
and he literally jumped out of his seat.

452
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,014
-Cool.
-Cool.

453
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,225
Immediately,
he wants to sponsor the show,

454
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,726
put you on our station,

455
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,271
and pay you guys a huge salary.

456
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,356
Of course, what he doesn't realize
is that you're both artists

457
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,816
and that you're not interested in money.

458
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,985
No, we're not interested in money.

459
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,194
That's what I told him.

460
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,988
But he said, "Go to Aurora anyway,

461
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,992
"and take two cashier's checks with you,
so they at least know that I'm serious."

462
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,994
I know that I may be wasting my time,

463
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,163
but here I am with the contract

464
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,956
and two cashier's checks

465
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,084
for $5,000 each.

466
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,879
Ex-squeeze me? Baking powder?

467
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:09,090
It sounded like you said you were gonna
pay us for doing Wayne's World.

468
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,802
I know. You just give me the word
and I'll tear up these checks right here.

469
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,262
No! No! No! No!

470
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,307
He shoots, he scores!

471
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,519
Well. Would you like to
look at the contracts?

472
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,146
-Yes.
-Do you have a lawyer?

473
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,981
Yes. No.

474
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,025
We're between lawyers right now.

475
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,861
You see, our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly...

476
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,781
That's right. I walked right into
that office, that's what I did,

477
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,367
and I reached across that desk,
and I grabbed him by his big fat head,

478
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,663
and I said, "Listen, man,
I'm not going to jail for you or anybody."

479
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:41,915
Exactly.

480
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:48,213
Can I have an opportunity to peruse
that contract before we sign it?

481
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,136
Yes.

482
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,931
I like what you've done here.

483
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,185
Yes. Yes.

484
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,811
I dropped my pen.

485
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,813
I'm not so sure about...

486
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,524
Oh, I see. I see.

487
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,277
Hi. Does this seem weird?

488
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,238
I mean, why does
this guy have contracts?

489
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,782
Did you ever see The Twilight Zone
where the guy signed a contract,

490
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,868
and they cut out his tongue, and they
put it in a jar, and it wouldn't die?

491
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:22,747
It just grew and pulsated
and gave birth to baby tongues.

492
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,500
Pretty cool, huh? I gotta go.

493
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,627
Oh, I like this part.

494
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,714
Well, I feel we can work with you
on this project.

495
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,093
Well, you've made Mr. Vanderhoff
a very happy man.

496
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,972
<i>To Wayne's World.</i>

497
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,683
<i>-To Wayne's World.</i>
<i>-To Wayne's World.</i>

498
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:49,357
<i>We got $5,000, we got $5,000</i>

499
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,693
Hey, check it out. Hey, Wayne.

500
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,697
<i>We got $5,000, we got $5,000</i>

501
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,956
<i>Ain't got no reason</i>

502
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,292
<i>For reaction</i>

503
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,835
Party!

504
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:13,631
<i>Ain't got no reason for distraction</i>

505
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,842
Great party, huh, guys?

506
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,347
<i>Love the way that you love me, baby</i>

507
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:25,310
<i>Love the way that you stare</i>

508
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,729
Stacy alert!

509
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,400
We've been spotted, and we're being
pulled in by her tractor beam.

510
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:35,111
-I gotta go.
-We gotta go.

511
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,698
<i>Ooh, if you dare</i>

512
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,078
<i>Don't be afraid to love me</i>

513
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,205
<i>Anywhere</i>

514
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,886
<i>Don't be afraid to love me</i>

515
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,513
<i>Anywhere</i>

516
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,809
<i>Won't you touch me?</i>

517
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,271
<i>Won't you love me?</i>

518
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,691
<i>Just let me know</i>

519
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,361
God, she's amazing. Yeah.

520
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,363
<i>l'll be there</i>

521
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,991
Wayne, Wayne,
Garth told me about the show, man.

522
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,243
I love you, man.

523
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,746
Yeah, and I love you, too, Terry.

524
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,832
No, no, no, I mean it, man. I love you.

525
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,627
No, I mean it. I love you.

526
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,629
No, you don't, man.

527
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,757
<i>Why don't you love me?</i>

528
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,884
Garth, hey, come over here.

529
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,470
I think Terry has something
he wants to say to you.

530
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,806
I love you, man.

531
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,349
Thank you.

532
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,564
<i>l'll be there</i>

533
00:28:54,316 --> 00:29:01,114
<i>Oh, l'll be there</i>

534
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,720
Your vocals are incredible.

535
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,222
Thanks.

536
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,016
You have a very interesting look.

537
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:30,643
Aha.

538
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,312
Oh, I'm not trying to pick up on you.

539
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,689
Good thing.

540
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,732
No, no, I'm producing a television show.

541
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,734
It's in Chicago, very late night,

542
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,445
but we're looking for a musical act.

543
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:44,240
Here's my card. Is there a number
where I can reach you at?

544
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,993
We got fliers at the door.

545
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,041
Hello.

546
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,889
Wayne? Hi, Wayne. Hi.

547
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,691
Hi, you wanna go somewhere and talk?

548
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,026
Sure.

549
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,162
What's going on in there?

550
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,371
Just a minute!

551
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,790
We'd like to go
to the bathroom, please...

552
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,084
-Yeah.
-...in this century.

553
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,794
How long you been waiting?

554
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,505
Like an hour now.

555
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,717
Hi, Garth.

556
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,385
Hi.

557
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,554
I'm looking for Wayne.
I'm very concerned about him.

558
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,098
He seems to be going through
this difficult phase right now.

559
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,435
-You know what I think it is?
-That you're mental?

560
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,562
You know him best.
What do you think I should do?

561
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,773
Just get over it.
Go out with somebody else.

562
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,900
"Get over it.
Go out with somebody else."

563
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,069
Yeah, thanks. Okay, great.

564
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,738
Hi.

565
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,784
So, who's this guy, Benjamin?

566
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,870
Only one of the most
important producers in television.

567
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,247
He's way ahead of his time.

568
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:17,333
We've signed with him.
He's based in Chicago.

569
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,627
He gave me his business card.
He's interested in the band.

570
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,713
Of course. I love your band.
You guys wail.

571
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,715
-Thanks.
-You guys kick ass.

572
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,050
You're double live gonzo,

573
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,553
intensity in ten cities, live at Budokan.

574
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,597
You know, if you guys got a break,
you could really make it.

575
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,643
Yeah, and if a frog had wings, he
wouldn't bump his ass when he hopped.

576
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,228
Interesting.

577
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,564
Where did you learn English?

578
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:40,815
College,

579
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,150
and the Police Academy movies.

580
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,485
Ah.

581
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,489
Cassandra,

582
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,661
I've got something I wanna say to you.

583
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,044
Campbell, that's amazing.

584
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,381
You learned how to say
I look pretty, in Cantonese.

585
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,563
Hi, Wayne.

586
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,481
Hello, Stacy.

587
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,233
Sit right here.

588
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,923
You make me laugh.

589
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,300
Can I call you?

590
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,843
Anytime.

591
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,766
Look out!

592
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,777
Oops.

593
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,982
Sometimes I wish I could boldly go
where no man's gone before,

594
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,986
but I'll probably stay in Aurora.

595
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,948
-What are you thinking about?
-Cassandra.

596
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,742
She's a fox.

597
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,411
In France,
she would be called La Renarde,

598
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,581
and she would be hunted,
with only her cunning to protect her.

599
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,790
She's a babe.

600
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,500
She's a robo-babe.

601
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,336
In Latin, she would
be called babia majora.

602
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:53,007
If she were a president,
she'd be Babe-raham Lincoln.

603
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,224
Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive

604
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,519
when he'd put on a dress
and play a girl bunny?

605
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:15,196
No.

606
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,823
Neither did I. I was just asking.

607
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,203
Okay, okay, keep looking up!

608
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,537
Okay.

609
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:50,481
Guys, I will be talking to the cameraman
on the headset.

610
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,983
It will be Terry's job
to give the actors their hand cues.

611
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:57,071
Oh, excuse me, Russell,
but I believe I requested the hand job.

612
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,158
Let's go on.

613
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,370
The cue is... Watch carefully.

614
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,916
Five, four, three...

615
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,796
You didn't say "two" or "one."

616
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,924
-Oh, you don't say "two" or "one."
-Why not?

617
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,260
You just don't, okay?

618
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,346
Now, it goes,

619
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,811
five, four, three...

620
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,441
-Good. Okay, good.
-Yeah, all right.

621
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,821
All right, now,
I think we're ready for rehearsal,

622
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,282
-unless there are any questions?
-Yeah.

623
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,909
Does this seem weird to anybody else?

624
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:47,204
I mean, we're looking down
on Wayne's basement,

625
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,040
only that's not Wayne's basement.

626
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,917
Isn't that weird?

627
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,587
-That's twisted.
-That's weird, man, that's weird.

628
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,298
Garth, that was a haiku.

629
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,301
Excellent.

630
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,011
-Control room.
-Russell.

631
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,679
Oh, hello, Benjamin.

632
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,806
<i>Just finishing up with the Vanderhoffs.</i>

633
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,391
They'd like to come down
and look at a rehearsal

634
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,394
and make sure
we're not wasting their money.

635
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,024
-Not a good idea, sir.
-Great.

636
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:18,652
Come in. Your landing gear is down.

637
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,487
Just put that down.

638
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:21,947
-Ow.
-Just go away, guys, okay?

639
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,116
Let's just... Maybe go down to the set.
Hey, hey, hey!

640
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,493
Russell's very excited
you're coming down to the studio.

641
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,870
Oh, the studio.

642
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,332
-That's where the magic happens.
-Oh, you've worked in television?

643
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,000
No, but I watch a lot of it.

644
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,252
Of course you do. You're creative.

645
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,963
She's the one who came up
with the name Noah's Arcade.

646
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,841
I just opened my mouth and out it came.

647
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,054
You're a lucky man, Mr. Vanderhoff.

648
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,724
<i>All right, can we bring in</i>
<i>the blue screen? Let's try one.</i>

649
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,227
<i>Ready to cue Wayne and Garth, and go.</i>

650
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,479
Okay.

651
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,982
In five, four, three...

652
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,237
<i>Good, Terry.</i>
<i>Wayne, Garth, don't count along.</i>

653
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,531
<i>We see your mouths moving. Again.</i>

654
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,701
In five, four, three...

655
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,412
<i>Guys, you're nodding.</i>

656
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,331
<i>Once again, Terry.</i>

657
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:17,044
In five, four, three, two...

658
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,757
Okay. Welcome to Wayne's World.
Party on, Garth.

659
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,925
Party on, Wayne.

660
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,344
<i>Okay, we got a new feature</i>
on Wayne's World this week,

661
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,638
<i>which allows us to travel</i>
<i>through time and space.</i>

662
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,847
<i>lt's called chroma key,</i>

663
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:32,476
<i>and it's really handy</i>
<i>if you wanna go to...New York.</i>

664
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,061
<i>Hey, we're in New York!</i>

665
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,647
<i>l've got a gun.</i>
<i>Let's go to a Broadway show.</i>

666
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,273
I guess kids get this?

667
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:39,733
-Oh, they love it.
<i>-Yo, taxi.</i>

668
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,152
<i>Or maybe you prefer Hawaii.</i>

669
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,488
Muka laka hickey.
<i>Come on, you wanna lay me.</i>

670
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,407
Pass the poi, mahalo.

671
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,326
<i>Or say you wanna go to Texas.</i>

672
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:53,163
<i>Howdy, partners.</i>
<i>Let's raise and rope broncos.</i>

673
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,498
Let's go down to the floor.

674
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,000
<i>Howdy, y'all.</i>

675
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,087
<i>Or imagine being able to be magically</i>
<i>whisked away to</i>

676
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,755
<i>Delaware.</i>

677
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,092
<i>Hi. l'm in Delaware.</i>

678
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,345
Noah and Mimi Vanderhoff,

679
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,931
say hello to Wayne Campbell
and Garth Algar.

680
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,891
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

681
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,018
-Hello.
-So, Garth,

682
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,812
how do you like being in a real studio?

683
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,107
It's like a new pair of underwear,
you know?

684
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,818
At first it's constrictive,

685
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:26,321
but after a while,
it becomes a part of you.

686
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,534
I gotta go.

687
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,744
Okay.

688
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,580
No, no, no. Please.

689
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,458
Wayne, I used to be in meat packing,

690
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,084
lips and hooves.

691
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,671
And then, one day,
I had a four-hour layover in Tulsa.

692
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,883
Well, there were these kids
in the airport that kept pumping quarters

693
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,885
into a game called Pong.

694
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,887
They must've gone through 50 bucks.

695
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,847
Well, I sat there watching and I said,

696
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,349
"Hell, I'm in the wrong business."

697
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,352
Fifteen years later, I'm a millionaire.

698
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,856
It's so huge.

699
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,274
Thanks.

700
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,985
Do I frighten you?

701
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,820
No.

702
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,489
Do you want me to?

703
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,866
You know, Noah, I gotta tell you,
I love you on that couch.

704
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,950
You think?

705
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,870
Wayne, did you know that
Noah does all his own commercials?

706
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,372
Yeah, I got a new one where I rap.

707
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,334
<i>Come bust a move</i>
<i>Where the games are played</i>

708
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,670
<i>lt's chill, it's fresh</i>
<i>lt's Noah's Arcade</i>

709
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,882
What do you think of that?

710
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,842
I'd have to say,

711
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,011
ass sphincter says what?

712
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,556
-What?
-A sphincter says what?

713
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,811
-What?
-Exactly.

714
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,437
Oh, we've got a lunch.

715
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,856
-That's what I think of it.
-Okay.

716
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,025
Well, it's been a pleasure.

717
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,278
May I say, I have just had a thrilling day.

718
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,613
-You may.
-Shall we?

719
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,533
And may I say, your wife's a babe.

720
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,660
-Well, thank you.
-We have a table.

721
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,384
What is it, girl?

722
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,387
Aliens have kidnapped Wayne?

723
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,807
Oh, I misunderstood. Wayne's outside.

724
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,225
Thanks, girl.

725
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,151
Okay! Game on!

726
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,155
-Game on.
-Game on.

727
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,827
He shoots, he scores!

728
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,287
One for one.

729
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,454
Crowd is going wild!

730
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,873
-Car!
-Car!

731
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,921
-Game on.
-Game on.

732
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,843
-Okay.
-All right, let's go.

733
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,971
Gump Worsley cuts down the angle.

734
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,681
Gretzky shoots!

735
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,892
Oh, Gretzky is denied!

736
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,019
Choked on the open net.

737
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,731
-Wayne?
-Yeah?

738
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,483
Do you ever get the feeling
that Benjamin's not one of us?

739
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,693
Good call.

740
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,696
It's as if Benjamin
wants us to be liked by everyone.

741
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,532
I mean, Led Zeppelin didn't write tunes
that everyone liked.

742
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,951
They left that to the Bee Gees.

743
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,745
-Car!
-Car!

744
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,752
-Game on.
-Game on.

745
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,674
Incoming. Stacy, 1 0:00.

746
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,051
Hi, Wayne.

747
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:36,929
Hi.

748
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,644
Hey, are you all right?

749
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,772
Oops.

750
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,857
And she's okay.

751
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,277
Game on.

752
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,987
Yeah, game on.

753
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:13,632
You know, Garth,
you and I have never really talked.

754
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,468
Okay.

755
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,846
You know,
I love what you do on the show.

756
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,433
I mean, I look at you,
and I just laugh and laugh.

757
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,019
Uh-huh.

758
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,022
Let me run this by you,
because you're a sharp guy.

759
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,402
I'm thinking about giving Vanderhoff
a weekly interview on the show.

760
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,113
How would you feel
about making a change?

761
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,489
We fear change.

762
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,509
So, Cassandra, I just have to say it,

763
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,386
-you look excellent.
-Thanks.

764
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,139
I've been so busy lately with my band,
I've been going shithouse.

765
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:03,807
I thought I was getting meningitis.

766
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,393
You know, I thought I had mono once
for an entire year.

767
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,229
It turned out I was just really bored.

768
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,650
<i>You're so fine, you're so fine</i>
<i>You blow my mind</i>

769
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,152
Excuse me?

770
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,155
I'm sorry. It's the last song I heard
this morning when I left the house.

771
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,365
Oh, yeah. I hate when that happens.

772
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,951
<i>Hey, Mickey, you're so fine</i>
<i>You're so fine, you blow my mind</i>

773
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,245
<i>Hey, Mickey</i>
<i>Hey, Mickey</i>

774
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:28,165
<i>Hey, Mickey, you're so fine</i>
<i>You're so fine, you blow my mind</i>

775
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,666
<i>Hey, Mickey</i>

776
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,422
I think I'm gonna put on some tunes.

777
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,133
Hey, when did you get the CD player?

778
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,760
When we got the money.

779
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,121
There it is,

780
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,289
Excalibur.

781
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,502
Wow, a '64 Fender Stratocaster
in classic white,

782
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,046
with triple single-coil pickups,
and a whammy bar.

783
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,131
Pre-CBS Fender corporate buyout.

784
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,050
I'd raise the bridge, file down the nut,

785
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,802
and take the buzz out of the low "E."

786
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,929
God, I love this woman.

787
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,681
-Hi, Garth.
-Hi.

788
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:28,308
Where's the clerk?

789
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,186
I know. I'll use the "May I help you" riff.

790
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,776
May I help you?

791
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,653
Yes, my good man.

792
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,988
I'd like to have a look at this
Fender Stratocaster, please.

793
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,657
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

794
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,158
-Again?
-Yes.

795
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:03,593
Be careful.

796
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,353
<i>No Stairway.</i>

797
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:14,855
Denied!

798
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,483
Wow!

799
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,194
You're amazing, dude.

800
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,862
Thanks.

801
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,447
I like to play.

802
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,036
Excuse me. Wayne?

803
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,289
Can I put the Fender back now, please?

804
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,250
Not today, my good man.
I'm feeling saucy.

805
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,793
I think I'm gonna buy it.

806
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,713
Do you accept...cash? Cha-ching.

807
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:33,433
Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

808
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:36,686
Yes, briefly. He was not very receptive.

809
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,398
Oh, really? Well, I'll explain it to him
that it's not a choice,

810
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:41,858
it's in his contract.

811
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:44,694
Oh. Well, Wayne
will understand that right away.

812
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,239
Not.

813
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,909
Excuse me.

814
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,703
I mean,
there was two Darrin Stephens , right?

815
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,664
Dick York, Dick Sargent.

816
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,959
Yeah, right, as if we wouldn't notice.

817
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:00,961
Oh, hold on.

818
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,963
Dick York. Dick Sargent.

819
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:05,382
Sergeant York. Wow, that's weird.

820
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,052
Wayne.

821
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,181
Listen, we need to have
a talk about Vanderhoff.

822
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,891
The fact is, he's the sponsor,

823
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,228
and you signed a contract
guaranteeing him certain concessions,

824
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,146
one of them being a spot on the show.

825
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,732
Well, that's where I see things
just a little differently.

826
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,610
Contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.

827
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:32,576
I'm sorry you feel that way, but
basically, it's the nature of the beast.

828
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,077
Maybe I'm wrong on this one,

829
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,871
but for me,
the beast doesn't include selling out.

830
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,254
Garth, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

831
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,177
It's like people only do things
because they get paid,

832
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,847
and that's just really sad.

833
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,559
I can't talk about it anymore.
It's giving me a headache.

834
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,312
Here. Take two of these.

835
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:06,151
Ah, Nuprin. Little. Yellow. Different.

836
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,780
Look. You can stay here
in the big leagues and play by the rules,

837
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:13,116
or you can
go back to the farm club in Aurora.

838
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,784
-It's your choice.
-Yes,

839
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,870
and it's the choice of a new generation.

840
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,258
<i>And her name was Cassandra</i>

841
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,885
Yeah.

842
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,225
-Anything wrong, Davy?
-Yeah. I got paid today.

843
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,895
-Oh, yeah, I know what that's like.
-No.

844
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,481
You don't understand. They laid me off.

845
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,441
I got one of these.

846
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,693
Yeah, I know how that feels.

847
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,322
-Know what I'd like to do?
-Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

848
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,658
You'd like to find the guy that did it,

849
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:58,703
rip his still-beating heart out of
his chest, and hold it in front of his face

850
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,873
so he can see how black it is
before he dies.

851
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,877
Actually, I was thinking about
filing a grievance with the union.

852
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,172
Well, the world's a twisted place.

853
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,843
Hi.

854
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:14,969
-Hey, how's it going, Garth?
-Hey, Garth.

855
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,179
Good.

856
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,434
Hey. There she is.

857
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,530
I must have slipped.

858
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,366
Wayne, what do you do

859
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,494
if every time
you see this one incredible woman,

860
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,246
you think you're gonna hurl?

861
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,497
I say, hurl.

862
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,834
If you blow chunks and she comes back,
she's yours.

863
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,002
If you spew and she bolts,

864
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,630
it was never meant to be.

865
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,969
Oh, I'm not ready yet.
I gotta be comfortable with me first.

866
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,887
Why don't you just go talk to her?

867
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,515
<i>Talk to her. Talk to her.</i>

<i>Why don't you just go talk to her?</i>

883
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:11,711
Garth?

884
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,384
Camera one.

885
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,178
Camera two.

886
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,971
Camera one.

887
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,515
Camera two.

888
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,060
Camera one, camera two.

889
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:28,978
Don't.

890
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,105
Camera one, camera two.

891
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,319
Tell me, when that first show is over,

892
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:40,114
will you still love me when I'm
an incredibly humongoid, giant star?

893
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,199
Yeah.

894
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,869
Will you still love me when I'm in my
hanging-out-with-Ravi-Shankar phase?

895
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:45,954
Yeah.

896
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:49,457
Will you still love me when I'm in
my carbohydrate, sequined jump-suit,

897
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:53,503
young-girls-in-white-cotton-panties,
waking-up-in-a-pool-of-your-own-vomit,

899
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,343
-Yeah.
-Okay. Party. Bonus.

900
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,555
Yeah?

901
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,473
-Oh, hi, Anthony.
-Who's Anthony?

902
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,141
-Who's Anthony?
-My drummer.

903
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,476
Okay.

904
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:10,854
You what?

905
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:15,149
No. I told you next week
we'll be doing a music video.

906
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,697
Do you mind? This is business.

907
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:24,868
Hey, you wanna be a busboy
the rest of your life?

908
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,245
Well, then talk to your boss.

909
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:35,545
Look, this guy Benjamin is
putting up serious money for this thing.

910
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,754
Yeah.

911
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,798
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:41,009

<i>To you</i>

915
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,520
Work it out, okay?

916
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:54,647
Just... No, just be there.

917
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:55,940
Okay. Bye.

918
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,151
You asshole!

919
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,286
Excellent.

920
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,221
-Hey. All right. Glad you could make it.
-Hi.

921
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,973
-Oh, wow!
-Yes.

922
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:30,099
Cool.

923
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,268
Yes.

924
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,229
This is definitely the type of place
I'm gonna get

925
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,773
when I move out of my parents' house.

926
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,441
Oh, you have a terrace.

927
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,276
Oh, yeah. Why don't you go on out?

928
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:42,487
I'll get the Dom Perignon.

929
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,618
What floor is this?

930
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,995
The 23rd.

931
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,671
You know, Cassandra,

932
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,131
from this height,

933
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,634
you could really hock a loogie
on someone.

934
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,266
You know, I feel so free up here.

935
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,394
It costs a lot to live this free.

936
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,105
You know, this might be a tangent, right,

937
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,857
but it's something
I've been thinking about.

938
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,401
Hi.

939
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,405
If I had a girl like Cassandra,
I wouldn't bring her here.

940
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,864
I mean, look at this place.

941
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:30,368
This is a fully-functional babe lair.

942
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,996
Chicks are helpless against its powers.

943
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,248
Let's check it out.

944
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,042
I don't believe I've ever had
French champagne before.

945
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:41,504
Oh, actually, all champagne is French.
It's named after the region.

946
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,090
Otherwise, it's sparkling white wine.

947
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,426
Americans, of course,
don't recognize the convention,

948
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,679
so it becomes that thing of calling
all of their sparkling whites champagne,

949
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,264
even though by definition they're not.

950
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,684
Ah, yes. It's a lot like
<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation.</i>

951
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:59,480
In many ways it's superior, but will
never be as recognized as the original.

952
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,860
Aha. What's this?

953
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,696

Mr. Vanderhoff's very excited.
I'm very excited.

964
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,945
I mean, I think the show's gonna be a
huge hit all over the Chicago land area.

965
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,947
Look, I want you and Garth
to have these.

966
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:52,950
It's two tickets to Alice Cooper's concert
tomorrow night in Milwaukee.

967
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,911
Wow! Backstage passes.

968
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,873
Whoa. All-access backstage
with Alice Cooper?

969
00:56:58,957 --> 00:56:59,999
Thank you.

970
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,126
Take the day off. Enjoy yourselves.

971
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,586
Well, what about Cassandra?

972
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,005
She and I have work to do.

-Here's to your success.
-No. Here's to Benjamin.

974
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,768
Who wants Chinese takeout?

975
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,353
I know a great place.

976
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,815
I'll have the Cream of Sum Yung Guy.

977
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,653
Cassandra, why don't you order?

978
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,614
Oh, no.
I'm sure whatever you order will be fine.

979
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,407

997
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:56,365
<i>Ooh, why you wanna break my heart?</i>

998
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,952
-Sounds great!
-Thanks.

999

-You got a minute?
-Sure.

1000
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,664
Hey, you guys, hang out.

1001
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,626
I thought I'd come by
and drop off the contract for the video.

1002
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,127
Oh, great.

1003
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,172
You know, I never really got a chance
to say thank you,

1004
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,506
but you've been very generous.

1005
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,717
Oh, well, it's been my pleasure.

1006
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,177
Listen, I thought if you were done here

1007
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,387
that maybe we could
spend the afternoon together.

1008
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,728
We should be pretty
close to Milwaukee by now.

1013
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:16,028
Yeah! We got backstage passes
for Alice Cooper!

1014
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,167
Do you wanna go backstage?

1015
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,963
Yeah. Let's go back now
and beat the crowd.

1016
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,950
-Where you going?
-Let him through. He's got a pass.

1017
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,911
-We got in!
-Excuse me, business.

1018
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,829
We got passes. Yeah!

1019
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:59,298
I think we took a wrong turn,
'cause we're outside now.

1020
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:01,550
Whoa, cool.

1021
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,389
Is this Alice's limo?

1022
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:09,558
No, it belongs to Frank Sharp,
head of Sharp Records.

1023
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,602
Good friend ofAlice's.

1024
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:15,564
Wow, that's, like,
way bigger than a normal-size car.

1025
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,566
Well, it has to be.

1026
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:20,236
He drives everywhere. Hates to fly.

1027
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:24,698
He's going across the country right now
to look for new acts to sign to his label.

1028
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,617
Next stop is St. Louis,

1029
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:30,830
then he's gonna come back
through Chicago on his way to Detroit.

1030
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:34,708
Thanks.

1031
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,256
You know, for a security guard,

1032
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,717
he had an awful lot of information,
don't you think?

-No, no, I can't let you in, sorry.

Excuse us.

1040
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,787
Alice. Is this cool?

1041
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:13,914
Yeah, come on in.

1042
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,291
Sorry to bother you,

1043
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,793
but we had to come and tell you
how much we really enjoyed the show,

1044
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,628
didn't we, Garth?

1045
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,257
Oh. Thanks.

1046
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:26,552
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

1047
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,263
My name is Wayne, and this is Garth.

1048
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,640
Nice to meet you guys.

1049
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,061
So, do you come to Milwaukee often?

1050
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,316
Well, I'm a regular visitor here,

1051
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,360
but Milwaukee has certainly had
its share of visitors.

1052
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,154
The French missionaries and explorers

1053
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,281
were coming here
as early as the late 1 600s

1054
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,241
to trade with the Native Americans.

1055
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,619
In fact, isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?

1056
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,120
Yes, Pete, it is.

1057
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:55,539
Actually, it's pronounced
"mee-lee-wa-kay,"

1058
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:58,417
which is Algonquin
for "The Good Land."

1059
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,669
I was not aware of that.

1060
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:03,005
I think one of the most
interesting aspects of Milwaukee

1061
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,008
is the fact that it's
the only major American city

1062
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,594
to have ever elected
three socialist mayors.

1063
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,096
Does this guy
know how to party or what?

1064
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,265
Huh? Huh?

1065
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,270
Okay. Well, we gotta get going.

1066
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,357
No, no, no.
Stick around. Hang out with us.

1067
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,945
Cool. Yeah, we'll stay
and hang around with youse.

1068
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,864
With Alice Cooper.

1069
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:36,622
-We're not worthy!
-We're not worthy!

1070
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,249
We're scum!

1071
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,458
We suck!

1072
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,881
Our first big show,
and we almost didn't make it.

1073
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:48,509
I really hope Cassandra's watching.

1074
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,265
Oh, yeah, perfect.
Whatever it costs, I think...

1075
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,516
-Hey, there they are.
-Hi, guys.

1076
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,600
-Hello.
-Hey, how's it going?

1077
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,768
Well, tonight's the night.

1078
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,062
You know, a lot of people
in the Chicago land area

1079
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,939
are gonna be watching the show.

1080
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,192
You know what?
I already know it's gonna be a hit.

1081
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,152
I'll be in the booth.

1082
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,613
Mr. Vanderhoff will be your first guest.

1083
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:10,948
Oh, hi, boys.

1084
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:12,992
What the hell is this?

1085
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,077
Can we fly in the sign, please?

1086
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:17,079
All right, that's it. Just bring her down.

1087
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,206
-That's good.
-What... What...

1088
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:21,667
Don't tense up. You're gonna be great.

1089
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,044
Garth, have you got a second?

1090
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,796
Simply read the cards.

1091
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,340
You're going to be wonderful. Really.

1092
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,633

1093
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,885
Oh, Russell,

1094
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,597
can I borrow your marker? I...

1095
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,099
-I need to make some notes.
-Sure.

1096
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:40,227

1097

1100
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,532
Okay.

01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,534

01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,937
It's Friday. It's 1 1 :30.

1112
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:27,483
It's time to party with your
excellent host Wayne Campbell,

1113
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:30,069
and with him, as always, is Garth.

1114
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,572
Party on, Wayne, and party on, Garth.

1115
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,407
<i>Wayne's World</i>

1116
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:39,328
Okay. Welcome to Wayne's World.

1117
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,996
Party on, Garth.

1118
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,081
I guess.

1119
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,416
<i>Okay, okay, first of all,</i>

1120
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:47,211
<i>we'd like to take</i>
a moment here on Wayne's World

1121
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:48,837
<i>to welcome our sponsor.</i>

1122
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:52,466
He's the owner
of a fine chain of Noah's Arcades.

1123
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,885
<i>Noah Vanderhoff. Nice name.</i>

1124
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,220
<i>Not.</i>

1125
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,598
<i>Now, Mr. Vanderhoff...</i>

1126
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,184
He's using the cards. Yes!

1127
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,144
I told you he'd fall in line.

1128
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:07,272
What is your most
popular video game right now?

1129
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,983
Desert Storm Commando Warrior.

1130
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:15,030
That would have to do with that
limited skirmish in the Middle East.

1131
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:16,115
Yes.

1132
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,325
What the hell's he doing?

1133
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:21,745
<i>Aren't there long lines</i>
<i>for your more popular games?</i>

1134
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:24,832
Well, at Noah's Arcade, we like to say

1135
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,793
<i>there's two of everything,</i>
<i>so there's never a line.</i>

1136
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,797
Okay. Now, tell me, Noah,
I've always wanted to know,

1137
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,592
what is the difference between Pac-Man
and Ms. Pac-Man, really?

1138
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,970
Well, she has a bow on her head.

1139
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,472
That's it?

1140
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:45,185
-Get right out of town.
-No, that's it.

1141
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:55,988
Well, thank you for being
on Wayne's World.

1142
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,240
It was informative and stimulating.

1143
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,492
Now, a word from our sponsor.

1144
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:02,911
We're at commercial.

1145
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,830
-Oh, that was fun.
-Okay.

1146
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,499
-Well, I'll see you next week.
-I hope.

1147
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,586
<i>Wayne, could you</i>
<i>come up to the booth, please?</i>

1148
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,671
Oh, honey, you were incredible.

1149
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,382
I think it went really well.

1150
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,219
Absolutely, honey. There was a huge
response in that little room up there.

1151
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,596
-Really?
-Sir, I can assure you that

1152
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,433
those phrases were not on the cards
when I gave them to him.

1153
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:27,561
Wayne, what the hell is going on?

1154
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,771
What are you doing?

1155
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,522
Same thing we always do.

1156
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,525
You've publicly humiliated the sponsor.

1157
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,110
-Yeah.
-You're fired.

1158
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,779
Fired? For that?

1159
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:40,491
Yeah. Right. That's it, I'm out of here,

1160
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,786
-and I'm taking my show with me.
-We own the show.

1161
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,579
Bite me.

1162
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,374
Okay.

1163
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,210
Are we back?

1164
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,629
Stand by.

1165
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:54,838
Coming back?

1166
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:55,964
<i>And go.</i>

1167
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,509
Five, four, three...

1168
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,478
I'm having a good time.

1169
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,938
Not.

1170
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,568
Did you ever see that scene in Scanners
when that dude's head blew up?

1171
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,663
-Hello?
<i>-Hello.</i>

1172
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:28,831
It's Benjamin.

1173
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:29,998
Oh, hi.

1174
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,501
Listen, did you see the show tonight?

1175
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,003
<i>l had to work at the club</i>
<i>so l only saw the first part,</i>

1176
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,172
but I laughed my ass off.

1177
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,091
Well, we had some
technical difficulties,

1178
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,969
and we're still playing with the format.

1179
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:44,429
Has Wayne talked to you?

1180
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,640
About what?

1181
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,350
Why? Are you canceling my video?

1182
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,186
No. In fact,
I called just to make sure we're still on.

1183
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:54,189
-Well, we got a deal, right?
-Absolutely.

1184
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,608
I'll see you in Chicago.

1185
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:58,235
Okay. Bye.

1186
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,034
You really pissed me off tonight.

1187
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,079
Garth, you've never been mad
at anything in your life.

1188
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,707
Yeah, but you shouldn't
have walked out on the show.

1189
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,334
I mean, you know, I handled it okay,

1190
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:17,170
but you shouldn't walk out on your friend
without telling him first.

1191
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,715
Oh, so I have to run everything
by you now?

1192
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,593
Yeah, I think you have to run everything
by me now.

1193
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,428
What am I, some sort of chimp?

1194
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:26,388
"With you, as always, is Garth"?

1195
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,307
Jim to your Marlin Perkins?

1196
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,642
You know,
Benjamin had you so snowed.

1197
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,395
You know what?
He's got it for Cassandra.

1198
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,230
-No way.
<i>-Way.</i>

1199
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:38,775
Yeah! Cassandra's not interested. As if.

1200
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,194
Okay, pop quiz,

1201
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,906
Cassandra is not interested
in Benjamin because:

1202
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,199
A) chicks think he's handsome,

1203
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,160
B) has cool car,

1204
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,746
C) has lots of cash,

1205
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,748
D) has no visible scars,

1206
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,626
E) does not live with parents.

1207
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:59,129
Okay, how about, "F) you're a gimp"?

1208
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:01,006
You know what you can do
with your pop quiz?

1209
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,425
You know what you can do
with your show?

1210
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:05,344
You can take a flying...

1211
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,563
...until the handle breaks off

1212
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:19,900
and you have to find a doctor
to pull it out again.

1213
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,860
Kiss your mother with that mouth?

1214
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:23,278
You've gone mental.

1215
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,280
I'm getting out of here, Damien.

1216
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,032
-Fine, then. Go.
-I'm gone.

1217
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,909
-Go, then.
-I am.

1218
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,327
-Go.
-I'm gone.

1219
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:31,995
-Go, then.
-Well, I am.

1220
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,803
Where you been?
I waited up for you last night,

1221
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,888
but you never showed.

1222
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,100
-Where you going?
-Chicago.

1223
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,643
Benjamin set up the video shoot.

1224
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,812
I'll be there for three days.

1225
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,398
Oh, well, I guess
Benjamin will be there, too.

1226
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,984
Well, he's producing it.
And what does that mean?

1227
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,193
Well, it just means that he's been

1228
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,862
paying you an awful lot
of attention lately.

1229
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,448
Well, maybe he thinks
I've got some talent.

1230
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:10,909
Maybe he's poking you.

1231
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:13,286
What?

1232
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,831
You think that's the way I get a gig?

1233
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,916
Well, first he screws me,
then he screws you,

1234
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,710
it's Dutch door action.

1235
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:24,089
Could you be any more insulting?

1236
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,091
Yeah.

1237
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,595
I think you'd better leave.

1238
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:34,891
Fine. I'm out of here.

1239
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:43,108
Oh, man.

1240
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,654
What the hell's going on?

1241
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,949
I lost my show, I lost my best friend,

1242
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:52,534
I lost my girl.

1243
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,911
I'm being shit on, that's all, shit on.

1244
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,456
And do you know
what really pisses me off?

1245
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,249
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1246
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,877
Okay, okay. Come on back.
Come on back.

1247
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,130
Things aren't as bad as they seem.

1248
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:07,549
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to dump on you.

1249
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,551
I'll figure something out.

1250
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:10,635
Okay?

1251
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:18,685
Hey, Mr. Donuthead Man,
who's trying to kill you?

1252
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,854
I don't know, but they better not.

1253
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:24,274
You know, if you stab a man
in the dead of winter,

1254
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,277
-steam will rise up from the wounds.
-Oh, yeah.

1255
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,864
That's not good! I'm not happy!

1256
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,908
Oh, no!

1257
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:36,244
Indians believed it was his soul
escaping from his body.

1258
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:37,746
Right, Glen.

1259
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:54,096
Hi.

1260
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:56,515
I'm sorry about what I did.

1261
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,351
Buds?

1262
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,479
Buds.

1263
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:08,777
Officer Koharski.

1264
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:11,279
Damn shame how they
screwed up your show.

1265
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,698
It was a nice little program.

1266
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,409
Not that I ever watched it.

1267
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,787
Here you go.

1268
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,747
So, how you doing?

1269
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,290
Okay, I suppose.

1270
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,376
Just wish I had Cassandra back.

1271
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,004
She's in Chicago
shooting a video with Benjamin.

1272
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:29,548
So...

1273
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,134
What are you going to do?

1274
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,468
I don't know.

1275
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,595
I do have one plan.

1276
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,268
What are you gonna do
with these guys?

1277
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,103
Oh, nothing, really.

1278
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,858
I just always wanted
to open a door to a room

1279
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:51,528
where people are being trained,
like in James Bond movies.

1280
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,238
-Wicked.
-Yeah.

1281
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,122
I think you should
just go get Cassandra.

1282
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,833
I just don't think she wants me to.

1283
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,421
Let me tell you a little something
I've learned about women.

1284
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,340
They want you to come get them.

1285
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,430
They love it.

1286
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,267
I just wish there was something
that I could offer her

1287
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,186
that Benjamin couldn't.

1288
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:26,396
You'll think of something.

1289
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,607
Wait a minute.

1290
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,983
No.

1291
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:32,110
Wait a minute.

1292
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,445
No.

1293
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,696
Wait a minute!

1294
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,199
I know, the guy in the limo, Mr. Big,

1295
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,618
the guy who owns Sharp Records.

1296
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,704
If there's only a way that we could
get him to listen to Cassandra play.

1297
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,206
Hold it, hold it.

1298
01:15:44,624 --> 01:15:46,583
You remember the security guard
at the concert?

1299
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,878
He said Mr. Sharp was driving
back through Chicago on Friday!

1300
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,088
That's right. Wow.

1301
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,884
Aren't we lucky we were there
to get all that information?

1302
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,053
It seemed extraneous at the time.

1303
01:15:58,179 --> 01:16:01,848
Okay, first I'll access
the secret military spy satellite

1304
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:04,309
that's in a geosynchronous orbit
over the Midwest.

1305
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,562
Then I'll ID the limo
by the vanity plate "Mr. Biggg"

1306
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:10,190
-and get its approximate position.
-Yes.

1307
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:12,400
Then I'll reposition the transmitter dish

1308
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,528
in the remote truck
to 1 7.32 degrees East,

1309
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:17,197
hit Westar IV over the Atlantic,

1310
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:19,908
bounce the signal down into the Azores,
up to comtech six,

1311
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:23,119
beam it back to Satcom III,
transponder number 1 37,

1312
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:26,581
and down to the dish
on the back of Mr. Big's limo.

1313
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,959
It's almost too easy.

1314
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,713
We can only pray
he's watching television in his limo

1315
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:35,465
at that exact moment.

1316
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,133
We'll need help.

1317
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,843
-We'll help.
-We'll help.

1318
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,804
You get Cassandra! We'll do the rest!

1319
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,515
To the Mirthmobile!

1320
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:44,975
Yeah!

1321
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,269
All right!

1322
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:55,360
Okay, this is a take, everybody.

1323
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,862
I think the snake fell asleep!

1324
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,493
Playback!

1325
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,209
<i>Looking good.</i>

1326
01:17:15,214 --> 01:17:19,551
<i>Ain't got no reason for reaction</i>

1327
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,886
<i>No</i>

1328
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:26,933
<i>Ain't got no reason for distraction</i>

1329
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:34,357
<i>l love the way that you love me, baby</i>

1330
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:38,111
<i>Love the way that you stare</i>

1331
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:42,115
<i>The way that you tease me, baby</i>

1332
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,952
<i>Touch me, yeah</i>

1333
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:47,829
<i>Touch me</i>

1334
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,498
This snake weighs a ton.

1335
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,167
<i>lt looks great on you.</i>

1336
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,877
I'm coming down now.

1337
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,129
<i>l'm telling you, you're hot.</i>

1338
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,209
Yes, officer? Is there something wrong?

1339
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,170
Have you seen this boy?

1340
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,433
You know, you're exactly right.

1341
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:51,976
Why leave the hotel?

1342
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,979
We'll have dinner sent up.
You can have a hot bath.

1343
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,398
-I'll make some calls.
-Cassandra!

1344
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:58,483
-Hold this.
-Cassandra!

1345
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:01,903
-We have to talk.
-I don't wanna talk to you.

1346
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,572
Cassandra, I've set up
an audition for you and your band.

1347
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,409
I'm putting my show back on the air.
You've got to be on it.

1348
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,576
Wayne, go home.

1349
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,578
No. I'm not going anywhere.

1350
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,705
Cassandra, I love you.

1351
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,417
You may not believe it, but I love you.

1352
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:18,753
Am I supposed to just
turn my back and leave?

1353
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,006
Am I supposed to be a man?

1354
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:25,802
Am I supposed to say,
"That's okay. I don't mind.

1355
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,223
"I don't mind!" Well, I mind!

1356
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,016
I mind big time!

1357
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:36,062
And you know what
the worst part of all is?

1358
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:39,023
I never learned to read.

1359
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:43,611
Is that true?

1360
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,489
Yes. Everything except the reading part.

1361
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,452
Very nice speech, Wayne.
We're very busy.

1362
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,912
Oh, of course. Her music video.

1363
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:54,747
Very clever.

1364
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,416
But where is her band?

1365
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:58,042
-Hi, Wayne.
-Hi, Wayne.

1366
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,837
Oh, hi, guys. I didn't see you there.

1367
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:05,258
Well, I guess you've thought
of everything, huh?

1368
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:08,678
Nothing left for me to do
but just go home.

1369
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,055
Bye-bye, Wayne. It's bedtime.

1370
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,516
But both you and I know

1371
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:16,603
that there is no film in this camera.

1372
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,025
Jimmy!

1373
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,572
Wayne!

1374
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,824
Go home.

1375
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:42,128
Sometimes people outgrow
one another.

1376
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:45,173
It's very sad,
but you can't let it drag you down.

1377
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,717
Is that you or the snake?

1378
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,098
Campbell, wait up!

1379
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,851
Cassandra, I know
I don't have his looks.

1380
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,353
I know I don't have his money.

1381
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:02,023
I know I don't have his connections,
his knowledge of fine wines.

1382
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:05,318
I know sometimes, that when I eat,
I get this clicking sound in my jaw...

1383
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,904
Shut your yap and get in the car.

1384
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:09,781
Excellent.

1385
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:22,961
That's right, girl.

1386
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:26,172
Mr. Big's limousine
is right where we want it.

1387
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,849
Gentlemen, this is it. Let's go.

1388
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,268
Down now!

1389
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:50,029
Wait up, guys. I fell on my keys.

1390
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,369
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1391
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,135
Freeze!

1392
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,095
Oh, hi, Russell. How's it going?

1393
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,180
Hold it right there. Hey, hey!

1394
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:19,434
Hey, watch where
you're pointing that thing.

1395
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:22,770
Give me the flashlight, Russell.
Give it to me.

1396
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:26,691
-You can help us, Russell.
-No! I'm supposed to stop you.

1397
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,901
What are you gonna do?

1398
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:32,155
You gonna be Benjamin's monkey boy
the rest of your life, is that it?

1399
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,198
-Benjamin's my friend.
-No.

1400
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:37,535
Benjamin is no one's friend.

1401
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:42,123
If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor,

1402
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,376
he'd be pralines and dick.

1403
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:48,963
It's okay!

1404
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,385
He's gonna be okay.

1405
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,640
Hi.

1406
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,224
-Hi.
-How's it going?

1407
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,235
I love you, man.

1408
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:12,987
I know.

1409
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,491
No, you don't.

1410
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,369
I love you, man.

1411
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,205
I know.

1412
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,124
Just say, "Thank you."

1413
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,585
Hey!

1414
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,173
Thank you.

1415
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:34,300
All right.

1416
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:38,054
I understand you're just doing yourjob,
but really, I'm very late.

1417
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:41,474
Would you mind turning around,
placing your hands on the hood, son?

1418
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,102
There's just one other thing
I've got to check.

1419
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,030
<i>Wayne's World, Wayne's World</i>

1420
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:58,241
<i>Party time, excellent</i>

1421
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:04,580
Okay, this is
a special Wayne's World, okay?

1422
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,457
<i>lt's for an audience of one.</i>

1423

01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,921

<i>and if you like what you see,</i>

1425
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,591
<i>we're at 2234 Pine Way,</i>
<i>in Aurora, lllinois.</i>

1426
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:17,427
So, ladies and gentlemen,

1427
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:21,305
I give you Cassandra and Crucial Taunt!

1428
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,725
-Yeah!
-Right on.

1429
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,397
<i>Well, it's been getting so hard</i>

1430
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:32,984
<i>Living with the things you do to me</i>

1431
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:38,322
<i>My dreams are getting so strange</i>

1432
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,659
<i>l'd like to tell you everything l see</i>

1433
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,831
<i>l see a man at the back</i>
<i>as a matter of fact</i>

1434
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,041
<i>His eyes are as red as the sun</i>

1435
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,294
<i>And a girl in the corner</i>
<i>let no one ignore her</i>

1436
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,921
<i>'Cause she thinks</i>
<i>she's the passionate one</i>

1437
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,590
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1438
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,341
<i>lt was like lightning</i>

1439
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:59,677
<i>Everybody was frightening</i>

1440
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:01,929
<i>And the music was soothing</i>

1441
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:03,973
<i>And they all started grooving</i>

1442
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:07,143
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1443
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,437
<i>And the man at the back</i>
<i>said everyone attack</i>

1444
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,314
<i>And it turned into a ballroom blitz</i>

1445
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:13,608
<i>And the girl in the corner said</i>
<i>Boy, l wanna warn you</i>

1446
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,568
<i>lt'll turn into a ballroom blitz</i>

1447
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:21,574
<i>Ballroom blitz</i>

1448
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,288
<i>l'm reaching out for something</i>

1449
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,208
<i>Touching nothing's all l ever do</i>

1450
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,797
<i>l softly call you over</i>

1451
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:40,092
<i>When you appear</i>
<i>there's nothing left of you</i>

1452
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,680
<i>Now the man at the back</i>
<i>is ready to crack</i>

1453
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:46,933
<i>As he raises his hands to the sky</i>

1454
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:49,143
<i>And the girl in the corner</i>
<i>is everyone's mourner</i>

1455
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,646
<i>She could kill you</i>
<i>with a wink of her eye</i>

1456
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,523
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1457
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,149
<i>lt was electric</i>

1458
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,318
<i>So frightfully hectic</i>

1459
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:59,737
<i>And the band started leaping</i>

1460
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:01,739
<i>'Cause they all stopped breathing</i>

1461
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:02,949
Yeah

1462
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:05,117
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1463
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:07,078
<i>And the man at the back</i>
<i>said everyone attack</i>

1464
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,163
<i>And it turned into a ballroom blitz</i>

1465
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:11,499
<i>And the girl in the corner said</i>
<i>Boy l wanna warn you</i>

1466
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,334
<i>lt'll turn into a ballroom blitz</i>

1467
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:19,340
<i>Ballroom blitz</i>

1468
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,249
Yeah!

1469
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,711
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp, Sharp Records.

1470
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:58,796
I saw your performance in my limo.

1471
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:01,841
I must say,
I've seen a lot of acts in my day,

1472
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:04,135
and although you're extremely beautiful,

1473
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,762
I just think it's the wrong time.

1474
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:08,431
-I'm sorry.
-Bummer, man.

1475
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:11,809
You screwed my career!

1476
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,229
I always knew you were small-time.

1477
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:20,651
Wayne, I'm pregnant,
that's why I've been so moody.

1478
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:25,865
Whoa!

1479
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,575
Look! A fire!

1480
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:28,868
Let's get out of here!

1481
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:31,495
My hair!

1482
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,760
Why, God?

1483
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,846
<i>Why?</i>

1484
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:59,690
Last night was the most incredible night
of my life.

1485
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,735
You were terrific.

1486
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,790
You didn't really think
she'd end up with Wayne, did you?

1487
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:18,751
As if.

1488
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,504
As if we'd end the movie like that. Yeah!

1489
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:24,006
-Let's do the Scooby-Doo ending.
-Good call.

1490
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:45,319
Hi. Frankie Sharp, Sharp Records.

1491
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:47,279
I just saw your performance in my limo.

1492
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:50,074
Wow, we got through.
Well, that wraps it up.

1493
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,826
But there's one last thing.

1494
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,912
Let's just see who you really are, mister.

1495
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:59,291
Why, it's Old Man Withers, the guy
who runs the haunted amusement park!

1496
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:03,546
And I would have got away with it, too,
if it hadn't been for you snooping kids!

1497
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:05,256
Good one, Shaggy.

1498
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,174
Excellent Scooby-Doo ending.

1499
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:09,010
Yeah, but I think we should do
the mega-happy ending.

1500
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:11,762
Oh, the mega-happy ending.
That's doable.

1501
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,992
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp, Sharp Records.

1502
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,286
I saw your performance in my limo.

1503
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,288
I must tell you, it was terrific.

1504
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,207
-Yeah. All right.
-In fact, I think it's so good,

1505
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:43,044
I'm gonna give you a six-album deal,
starting tomorrow.

1506
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,254
-Yes.
-See you in my office.

1507
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:49,383
-I love you, Wayne.
-I love you, Cassandra.

1508
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,057
-I love you, Garth.
-I love you, dream woman.

1509
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:00,061
You know, ever since I did your show,

1510
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:02,646
kids are looking at me
in a whole new way.

1511
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:06,108
-I love you, man.
-And I love you,

1512
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:11,072
because I've learned that platonic love
can exist between two grown men.

1513
01:30:12,032 --> 01:30:13,991
And I've learned something, too.

1514
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:16,577
I've learned that a flawless profile,

1515
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,455
a perfect body, the right clothes
and a great car

1516
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:22,458
can get you far in America,
almost to the top,

1517
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,044
but it can't get you everything.

1518
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:29,298
Isn't it great that we're all better people?

1519
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,218
-Fished in!
-Fished in!

1520
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:37,556
Fished in!

1521
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:27,815
<i>-All right, excellent movie. All right.</i>
<i>-Yeah. Good one.</i>

1522
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:30,693
All right. Well, that's all the time
we have for our movie.

1523
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,903
We hope you found it entertaining,

1524
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:35,030
whimsical and yet relevant,

1525
01:31:35,115 --> 01:31:36,949
with an underlying revisionist conceit

1526
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:41,203
that belied the film's emotional
attachments to the subject matter.

1527
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:44,748
I just hope you didn't think it sucked.

1528
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,335
Okay. So, thank you for coming.
Good night and party on.

1529
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,254
-Party on, Wayne.
-Party on, Garth.

1530
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:01,552
You know, I don't think
anyone's gonna tell us when to leave.

1531
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:04,221
Yeah, good call, Garth.

1532
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:06,640
I'll bet we're just gonna sit here,

1533
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:10,019
and when they're finished,
they'll fade to black.

1534
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:15,816
<i>l can't believe they did that.</i>

1535
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,067
<i>l told you.</i>
